<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>RESPECTING the source from which the following letters have been drawn, and the grounds on which the reader is expected to rest his be∣lief of their authenticity, it may be sufficient to inform him (and, for the truth of the assertion, to appeal to His Excellency Thomas Pinckney, the Ameri∣can Minister Plenipotentiary) that permission was obtained from the proper authority, to transcribe, from the original papers preserved in the Secretary of State's office in Philadelphia, these and sundry other authentic documents relating to the contest between the colonies and the mother country, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Letters from the Commanders of the continental forces, and other persons em∣ployed in the public service,—intercepted letters from British Officers and o∣ther adherents to the royal cause,—Communications from the Governors, Con∣ventions, and Committees of the several American States,—Dispatches from Agents and Commissioners,—Instructions,—Reports of Committees of Congress,—parts of the Secret Journals hitherto unpublished,—and various other pieces elucidative of the events which led to and finally established American Inde∣pendence.</P>
<P>That permission was granted early in the year 1792, and immediate advan∣tage was taken of the indulgence; though, from various circumstances, of lit∣tle consequence to the reader to know, the publication has been so long delay∣ed. Even at this late period, the editor contents himself with laying before the public but a part of the collection,—intending, if these volumes meet with a favorable reception, to continue the publication, and present his readers with a variety of interesting pieces penned by the leaders and principal agents in the American Revolution, and tending to throw light on many important transactions that have hitherto been either enveloped in total darkness, or, at best but obscurely perceived and imperfectly understood.</P>
<P>Some parts of these letters may perhaps appear too full of minutiae to in∣terest that class of readers, who, unaccustomed to enter into the investigation of causes or consequences, delight only in recitals of battles, sieges, or other striking occurrences, which constitute the more prominent features of history. But to the reasoning philosophic reader, who wishes to explore the secret springs of action,—to trace events to their remote and latent causes,—to discover and examine the subordinate and collateral circumstances (oft trifling in appear∣ance, and generally overlooked by the vulgar eye) which, in the struggles of contending nations, give a preponderancy to the one or the other scale,—those minute details will, it is presumed, be far from unacceptable, as furnishing him with that species of information, upon which alone he can venture to ground a decisive opinion, and which he might elsewhere seek in vain.</P>
<P>The inclosures, frequently referred to in these volumes, would still further contribute to set every circumstance in a clearer and stronger light; and it was the editor's original intention that they should have accompanied the letters to which they respectively belong. Obstacles however, <HI>at present</HI> in∣surmountable, stand in the way of their immediate publication: but, when these are removed, the papers alluded to shall make their appearance in form of an Appendix,—such parts of them at least, as are of a curious and interesting nature.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="031423_0003_0FEC4A5615F621A0"/>
Meanwhile the reader will observe that it was deemed as yet premature to publish certain passages of these letters: some omissions have of course taken place, which are every where pointed out by asterisks, and which will be sup∣plied at a proper season, probably not far distant.—On the other hand, in per∣haps half a dozen instances, a single word has been hazarded on conjecture, to fill up a chasm, where either the original or the copy happened to be torn or defaced; in which cases the supplemental words are inclosed within crotchets and printed in Italic.—A few entire letters, moreover, as appears by reference made to them in subsequent ones, are here wanted to complete the chain of correspondence. These the editor can give no account of, as the originals ap∣pear to have been lost from the files of offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</P>
<P>About a dozen letters, written by the general's secretary,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. R. H. Harrison.</HI></NOTE>, are here insert∣ed,—a few from the general himself to the board of war, or committee of Con∣gress,—one to the president of the New-York Convention, and one to R. Mor∣ris, esquire, in the department of finance. These it was thought proper to o∣mit: nor did it seem worth while, on account of a few exceptions, to make a∣ny alteration in the general title of the book.</P>

<P>THE rain on friday afternoon and saturday,—the advice of several gentlemen of the Jerseys and this city, by no means to cross Hudson's river at the lower ferry,—and some other cir∣cumstances too trivial to mention, prevented my arrival at this place, until the afternoon of this day.</P>

Powder is so essential an article, that I cannot help again repeating the necessity of a supply. The camp at Boston, from the best ac∣count I can get from thence, is but very poorly supplied. At this place, they have scarce any. How they are provided at general Wooster's camp, I have not been able yet to learn.</P>
<P>Governor Tryon is arrived, and general Schuyler directed to advise you of the line of conduct he moves in. I fear it will not be very favorable to the American cause.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPON my arrival hdere this afternoon, I was informed that an express was in town, from the provincial camp in Mas∣sachusetts-Bay; and having seen, among the papers in his pos∣session, a letter directed to you as president of the Congress, I have taken the liberty to open it. I was induced to take that li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erty, by several gentlemen of New-York, who were anxious to know the particulars of the affair of the seventeenth instant, and agreeable to the orders of many members of the Congress, who judged it necessary that I should avail myself of the best information in the course of my journey.</P>
<P>You will find, sir, by that letter, a great want of powder in the provincial army, which I sincerely hope the Congress will sup∣ply as speedily and as effectually as in their power. One thou∣sand pounds in weight were sent to the camp at Cambridge, three days ago, from this city; which has left this place almost destitute of that necessary article: there being at this time from the best information, not more than four barrels of powder in the city of New-York.</P>
<P>I propose to set off for the provincial camp to-morrow, and will use all possible dispatch to join the forces there.</P>
<P>Please to make my compliments to the gentlemen of the Con∣gress; and believe me to be, sir, your obliged friend and hum∣ble servant.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ARRIVED safe at this place on the third instant, after a journey attended with a good deal of fatigue, and retarded by necessary attentions to the successive civilities which accompa∣nied me on my whole route.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival, I immediately visited the several posts oc∣cupied by our troops; and, as soon as the weather permitted, reconnoitred those of the enemy. I found the latter strongly intrenched on Bunker's hill, about a mile from Charlestown, and advanced about half a mile from the place of the late ac∣tion, with their centries extended about one hundred and fifty yards on this side of the narrowest part of the neck leading
<PB N="7" REF="031423_0006_0FEC4A105D103750"/>
from this place to Charlestown. Three floating batteries lie in Mystick river near their camp, and one twenty-gun ship below the ferry place between Boston and Charlestown. They have also a battery on Copse-hill, on the Boston side, which much annoyed our troops in the late attack. Upon the neck, they have also deeply intrenched and fortified. Their advanced guards, till last saturday morning, occupied Brown's houses, a∣bout a mile from Roxbury meeting-house, and twenty rod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from their lines: but, at that time, a party from general Tho∣mas's camp surprised the guard, drove them in, and burned the houses. The bulk of their army, commanded by general Howe, lies on Bunker's-hill, and the remainder on Roxbury-neck, ex∣cept the light-horse, and a few men in the town of Boston.</P>
<P>On our side, we have thrown up intrenchments on Winter and Prospect hills,—the enemy's camp in full view, at the dis∣tance of a little more than a mile. Such intermediate points as would admit a landing, I have since my arrival taken care to strengthen, down to Sewal's farm, where a strong intrench∣ment has been thrown up. At Roxbury, general Thomas has thrown up a strong work on the hill, about two hundred yards above the meeting-house; which, with the brokenness of the ground, and a great number of rocks, has made that pass very secure. The troops raised in New-Hampshire, with a regiment from Rhode-Island, occupy Winter-hill; a part of those from Connecticut, under general Putnam, are on Prospect-hill. The troops in this town are entirely of the Massachusetts: the re∣mainder of the Rhode-Island-men are at Sewal's farm. Two regiments of Connecticut, and nine of the Massachusetts, are at Roxbury. The residue of the army, to the number of about seven hundred, are posted in several small towns along the coast, to prevent the depredations of the enemy.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I think myself authorised to say, that, con∣sidering the great extent of line and the nature of the ground, we are as well secured, as could be expected in so short a time, and under the disadvantages we labor. These consist in a want of engineers, to construct proper works and direct the men, a wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of tools, and a sufficient number of men to man the works in case of an attack. You will observe, by the proceedings of the council of war which I have the honor to inclose, that it is our unanimous opinion to hold and defend these works as long as possible. The discouragement it would give the men, and its contrary effects on the ministerial troops, thus to abandon our encampment in their face, formed with so much labor,—
<PB N="8" REF="031423_0007_0FEC4B5542CD0698"/>
added to the certain destruction of a considerable and valuable extent of country, and our uncertainty of finding a place in all respects so capable of making a stand,—are leading reasons for this determination. At the same time we are very sensible of the difficulties which attend the defence of lines of so great ex∣tent, and the dangers which may ensue from such a division of the army.</P>
<P>My earnest wish to comply with the instructions of the Con∣gress, in making an early and complete return of the state of the army, has led into an involuntary delay in addressing you; which has given me much concern. Having given orders for this purpose immediately on my arrival,—and unapprised of the imperfect obedience which had been paid to those of the like nature from general Ward, I was led from day to day to expect they would come in, and therefore detained the messenger.—They are not now so complete as I could wish: but much al∣lowance is to be made for inexperience in forms, and a liberty which had been taken (not given) on this subject. These rea∣sons, I flatter myself, will no longer exist; and, of consequence, more regularity and exactness will in future prevail. This, with a necessary attention to the lines, the movements of the ministe∣rial troops, and our immediate security, must be my apology, which I beg you to lay before Congress with the utmost duty and respect.</P>
<P>We labor under great disadvantages for want of tents; for, though they have been helped out by a collection of now use∣less sails from the sea-port towns, the number is far short of our necessities. The colleges and houses of this town are necessa∣rily occupied by the troops; which affords another reason for keeping our present situation. But I most sincerely wish the whole army was properly provided to take the field, as I am well assured that (besides greater expedition and activity in case of alarm) it would highly conduce to health and discipline. As materials are not to be had here, I would beg leave to recom∣mend the procuring a farther supply from Philadelphia as soon as possible.</P>
<P>I should be extremely deficient in gratitude as well as justice, if I did not take the first opportunity to acknowledge the rea∣diness and attention, which the provincial Congress and different committees have shewn, to make every thing as convenient and agreeable as possible. But there is a vital and inherent princi∣ple of delay, incompatible with military service, in transacting business through such numerous and different channels. I es∣teem it therefore my duty to represent the inconvenience which
<PB N="9" REF="031423_0008_0FEC4A2E86D8A7B0"/>
must unavoidably ensue from a dependence on a number of per∣sons for supplies; and submit it to the consideration of Congress, whether the public service will not be best promoted by ap∣pointing a commissary-general for these purposes. We have a striking instance of the preference of such a mode, in the estab∣lishment of Connecticut, as their troops are extremely well pro∣vided under the direction of Mr. Trumbull, and he has at dif∣ferent times assisted others with various articles. Should my sentiments happily coincide with those of your honors on this subject, I beg leave to recommend Mr. Trumbull as a very proper person for this department. In the arrangement of troops collected under such circumstances, and upon the spur of immediate necessity, several appointments are omitted, which appear to be indispensably necessary for the good government of the army—particularly a quarter-master-general, a commis∣sary of musters, and a commissary of artillery. These I must earnestly recommend to the notice and provision of Congress.</P>
<P>I find myself already much embarrassed, for want of a milita∣ry chest. These embarrassments will increase every day: I must therefore request that money may be forwarded as soon as pos∣sible. The want of this most necessary article will (I fear) pro∣duce great inconveniencies, if not prevented by an early atten∣tion. I find the army in general, and the troops raised in Mas∣sachusetts in particular, very deficient in necessary clothing.—Upon enquiry, there appears no probability of obtaining any supplies in this quarter; and, on the best consideration of this matter I am able to form, I am of opinion that a number of hunting shirts (not less than ten thousand) would in a great de∣gree remove this difficulty, in the cheapest and quickest manner. I know nothing, in a speculative view, more trivial, yet, if put in practice, would have a happier tendency to unite the men, and abolish those provincial distinctions which lead to jealousy and dissatisfaction.</P>
<P>In a forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part of this letter, I mentioned the want of en∣gineers. I can hardly express the disappointment I have ex∣perienced on this subject,—the skill of those we have being very imperfect, and confined to the mere manual exercise of cannon; whereas the war in which we are engaged requires a knowledge, comprehending the duties of the field, and fortification. If a∣ny persons thus qualified are to be found in the southern colo∣nies, it would be of great public service to forward them with all expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031423_0009_0FEC4A38A7ECC3A0"/>
Upon the article of ammunition, I must re-echo my former complaints on this subject. We are so exceedingly destitute, that our artillery will be of little use, without a supply both large and seasonable. What we have must be reserved for the small∣arms, and that managed with the utmost frugality. * * *</P>
<P>The state of the army you will find ascertained with tolera∣ble precision in the returns which accompany this letter. Up∣on finding the number of men to fall so far short of the estab∣lishment, and below all expectation, I immediately called a council of the general officers, whose opinion (as to the mode of filling up the regiments, and providing for the pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t exi∣gency) I have the honor of inclosing, together with the best judgment we are able to form of the ministerial troops. From the number of boys, deserters, and negroes, that have been en∣listed in the troops of this province, I entertain some doubts whether the number required can be raised here: and all the general officers agree that no dependence can be put upon the militia, for a continuance in camp, or regularity and discipline during the short time they may stay. This unhappy and de∣voted province has been so long in a state of anarchy, and the yoke * * * * * been laid so heavily on it, that great allowances are to be made for troops raised under such circum∣stances. The deficiency of numbers, discipline, and stores, can only lead to this conclusion—that their spirit has exceeded their strength. But at the same time I would humbly submit to the consideration of Congress the propriety of making some further provision of men from the other colonies. If these regiments should be completed to their establishment, the dismission of those unfit for duty on account of their age and character would occasion a considerable reduction; and, at all events, they have been enlisted upon such terms, that they may be disband∣ed when other troops arrive. But should my apprehensions be realised, and the regiments here not filled up, the public cause would suffer by an absolute dependence upon so doubtful an event, unless some provision is made against such a disappoint∣ment.</P>
<P>It requires no military skill, to judge of the difficulty of in∣troducing proper discipline and subordination into an army, while we have the enemy in view, and are in daily expectation of an attack: but it is of so much importance, that every ef∣fort will be made, which time and circumstances will admit. In the mean time, I have a sincere pleasure in observing that there are materials for a good army,—a great number of able-bodied
<PB N="11" REF="031423_0010_0FEC4A3D90571718"/>
men, active, zealous in the cause, and of unquestionable courage.</P>
<P>I am now, sir, to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the twenty-eighth, inclosing the resolutions of Congress, of the twenty-seventh ultimo, and a copy of a letter from the commit∣tee of Albany; to all which I shall pay due attention.</P>
<P>Generals Gates and Sullivan have both arrived in good health.</P>
<P>My best abilities are at all times devoted to the service of my country; but I feel the weight, importance, and variety of my present duties too sensibly, not to wish a more immediate and frequent communication with the Congress. I fear it may often happen in the course of our present operations, that I shall need that assistance and direction from them, which time and distance will not allow me to receive.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I have also to acknowledge your fa∣vor of the fourth instant by Fessenden, and the receipt of the commissions and articles of war. The former are yet eight hun∣dred short of the number required. This deficiency you will please to supply as soon as you conveniently can. Among the other returns, I have also sent one of our killed, wounded, and missing, in the late action: but have been able to procure no certain account of the loss of the ministerial troops. My best intelligence fixes it at about five hundred killed, and six or se∣ven hundred wounded: but it is no more than conjecture,—the utmost pains being taken on their side to conceal it.</P>

<P>P. S. Having ordered the commanding officer to give me the earliest intelligence of every motion of the enemy by land or water, discernible from the heights of his camp. I this instant, as I was closing my letter, received the inclosed from the bri∣gade-major. The design of this manoeuvre I know not:—per∣haps it may be to make a descent somewhere along the coast:—it may be for New-York; or it may be practised as a decep∣tion on us. I thought it not improper however to mention the matter to you:—I have done the same to the commanding officer at New-York; and I shall let it be known to the com∣mittee of safety here, so that intelligenoe may be communicat∣ed, as they shall think best, along the sea-coast of this govern∣ment.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I did myself the honor of addressing you on the tenth instant, nothing material has happened in the camp. From some authentic and later advices of the state of the ministerial troops, and the great inconvenience of calling in the militia in the midst of harvest, I have been induced for the present to wave it:—but in the mean time recruiting parties have been sent throughout this province, to fill up the regiments to the e∣stablishment of the provincial Congress. At the same time that I received these advices, I also obtained a list of the officers of the enemy killed and wounded in the late battle at Charlestown, which I take this opportunity to inclose.</P>
<P>The great scarcity of fresh provisions in their army has led me to take every precaution to prevent a supply: for this pur∣pose, I have ordered all the cattle and sheep to be drawn from the low grounds and farms within their reach. A detachment from general Thomas's camp, on wednesday night, went over to Long-Island, and brought from thence twenty cattle and a number of sheep, with about fifteen laborers who had been put on by a Mr. Ray Thomas, to cut the hay, &amp;c. By some acci∣dent they omitted burning the hay, and returned the next day at noon to complete it; which they effected, amidst the firing of the shipping, with the loss of one man killed and another wounded.</P>
<P>Last evening also a party of the Connecticut men strolled down on the marsh at Roxbury, and fired upon a centry; which drew on a heavy fire from the enemy's lines and floating batte∣ries, but attended with no other effect than the loss of one kill∣ed by a shot from the enemy's lines. In the man time, we are, on both sides, continuing our works: but there has been no o∣ther movement than what I have noticed above. I shall endea∣vour to give a regular and particular account of all transactions as they occur, which you will please to lay before the honora∣ble Congress. I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I did myself the honor of addressing you the four∣teenth instant, I have received advice from governor Trumbull, that the assembly of Connecticut had voted, and that they are now raising, two regiments of seven hundred men each, in con∣sequence of an application from the provincial Congress of Mas∣sachusetts-Bay.
<PB N="13" REF="031423_0012_0FEC48AD2A93FE70"/>
The Rhode-Island assembly has also made an augmentation for this purpose. These reinforcements, with the riflemen who are daily expected, and such recruits as may come in to fill up the regiments here, will, I apprehend, com∣pose an army sufficiently strong to oppose any force which may be brought against us at present. I am very sensible that the heavy expense, necessarily attendant upon this campaign, will call for the utmost frugality and care, and would therefore, if possible, avoid enlisting one unnecessary man. As this is the first certain account of the destination of these new-raised troops, I thought proper to communicate my sentiments as early as possible, lest the Congress should act upon my letter of the tenth, and raise troops in the southern colonies, which, in my present judgment may be dispensed with.</P>
<P>For these eight days past there have been no movements in either camp, of any consequence. On our side we have conti∣nued the works without any intermission; and they are now so far advanced as to leave us little to apprehend on that score. On the side of the enemy they have also been very industrious in finishing their lines, both on Bunker's-hill and Roxbury∣neck. In this interval also, their transports have arrived from New-York; and they have been employed in landing and sta∣tioning their men. I have been able to collect no certain ac∣count of the numbers arrived: but the inclosed letter, wrote (though not signed) by Mr. Sheriff Lee, and delivered me by captain Darby (who went express with an account of the Lex∣ington battle) will enable us to form a pretty accurate judg∣ment. The increase of tents and men in the town of Boston is very obvious; but all my accounts from thence agree that there is a great mortality, occasioned by the want of vegeta∣bles and fresh meat; and that their loss in the late battle at Charlestown (from the few recoveries of their wounded) is greater than at first supposed. The condition of the inhabit∣ants detained in Boston is very distressing: they are equally destitute of the comfort of fresh provisions; and many of them are so reduced in their circumstances, as to be unable to sup∣ply themselves with salt. Such fish as the soldiery leave, is their principal support. Added to all this, such suspicion and jealousy prevails, that they can scarcely speak, or even look, without exposing themselves to some species of military execu∣tion.</P>
<P>I have not been able, from any intelligence I have received, to form any certain judgment of the future operations of the enemy. Sometimes I have suspected an intention of detaching
<PB N="14" REF="031423_0013_0FEC4787106B1448"/>
a part of their army to some part of the coast, as they have been building a number of flat-bottomed boats, capable of holding two hundred men each. But, from their works, and the language held at Boston, there is reason to think they ex∣pect the attack from us, and are principally engaged in prepar∣ing themselves against it. I have ordered all the whale-boats along the coast to be collected: and some of them are employed every night to watch the motions of the enemy by water, so as to guard as much as possible against any surprise. * * *</P>
<P>Next to the more immediate and pressing duties of putting our lines in as secure a state as possible, attending to the move∣ments of the enemy, and gaining intelligence—my great con∣cern is to establish order, regularity, and discipline, without which, our numbers would embarrass us, and, in case of action, general confusion must infallibly ensue. In order to this, I propose to divide the army into three divisions:—at the head of each, will be a general officer:—these divisions to be again subdivided into brigades, under their respective brigadiers. But the difficulty arising from the arrangement of the general officers, and waiting the further proceedings of the Congress on this subject, has much retarded my progress in this most neces∣sary work. I should be very happy to receive their final com∣mands, as any determination would enable me to proceed in my plan. * * *</P>
<P>In addition to the officers mentioned in mine of the tenth instant, I would humbly propose that some provision should be made for a judge-advocate, and provost-marshal. The necessi∣ty of the first appointment was so great, that I was obliged to nominate Mr. Tudor, who was well recommended to me, and now executes the office under the expectation of receiving cap∣tain's pay—an allowance (in my opinion) scarcely adequate to the service, in new-raised troops, where there are court-mar∣tials every day. However, as that is the proportion in the regular army, and he is contented, there will be no necessity of an addition.</P>
<P>I must also renew my request as to money, and the appoint∣ment of a paymaster. I have forebore urging matters of this nature, from my knowledge of the many important concerns which engage the attention of the Congress; but as I find my difficulties thicken every day, I make no doubt, suitable regard will be paid to a necessity of this kind. The inconvenience of borrowing such sums as are constantly requisite must be too plain for me to enlarge upon, and is a situation from which I should be very happy to be relieved.</P>

Upon the experience I have had, and the best consideration of the appointment of the several officers of commissary-gene∣ral, muster-master general, quarter master-general, pay master-general, and commissary of artillery, I am clearly of opinion that they not only conduce to order, dispatch and discipline, but that it is a measure of oeconomy. The delay, the waste, and unpunishable neglect of duty, arising from these officers being in commission of several hands, evidently show that the public expense must be finally enhanced. I have experienced the want of these officers, in completing the returns of men, ammunition, and stores. The latter are yet imperfect, from the number of hands in which they are dispersed. I have in∣closed the last weekly return, which is more accurate than the former; and hope in a little time we shall be perfectly regular in this as well as several other necessary branches of duty.</P>
<P>I have made inquiry into the establishment of the hospital, and find it in a very unsettled condition. There is no princi∣pal director, nor any subordination among the surgeons: of consequence, disputes and contentions have arisen, and must continue until it is reduced to some system. I could wish it was immediately taken into consideration, as the lives and health of both officers and men so much depend upon a due regulation of this department. I have been particularly atten∣tive to the least symptoms of the small-pox; and hitherto we have been so fortunate as to have every person removed so soon, as not only to prevent any communication, but any alarm or apprehension it might give in the camp. We shall continue the utmost vigilance against this most dangerous enemy.</P>
<P>In an army properly organised, there are sundry offices of an inferior kind, such as waggon-master, master carpenter, &amp;c. but I doubt whether my powers are sufficiently extensive for such appointments. If it is thought proper to repose such a trust in me, I shall be governed, in the discharge of it, by a strict regard to oeconomy and the public interest.</P>
<P>My instructions from the honorable Congress direct that no troops are to be disbanded without their express direction, nor to be recruited to more than double the number of the enemy. Upon this subject I beg leave to represent, that unless the re∣giments in this province are more successful in recruiting than I have reason to expect, a reduction of some of them will be highly necessary, as the public is put to the whole expense of an establishment of officers, while the real strength of the regi∣ment (which consists in the rank and file) is defective. In case of such a reduction, doubtless some of the privates and all the
<PB N="16" REF="031423_0015_0FEC4A5843CD34A0"/>
officers would return home: but many of the former would go into the remaining regiments; and, having had some experi∣ence, would fill them up with useful men. I so plainly per∣ceive the expense of this campaign will exceed any calculation hitherto made, that I am particularly anxious to strike off eve∣ry unnecessary charge. You will therefore, Sir, be pleased to favor me with explicit directions from the Congress, on the mode of this reduction (if it shall appear necessary) that no time may be lost when such necessity appears.</P>
<P>Yesterday we had an account that the light-house was on fire:—by whom, and under what orders, I have not yet learn∣ed; but we have reason to believe it has been done by our ir∣regulars.</P>
<P>You will please to present me to the Congress, with the ut∣most duty and respect; and believe me to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>NOTHING material has occurred in either camp, since I had the honor of addressing you on the twenty-first instant by

express: but on tuesday three men-of-war and nine transports sailed out of Boston harbor, and stood a course about E. S. E.</P>
<P>One Groves, who came out of Boston the same evening in∣formed the officer at one of the outposts, that the transports had on board six hundred men, and were bound to Block-Is∣land, Fisher's-Island, and Long-Island, to plunder them, and bring off what cattle they may find. The fellow returned a∣gain into Boston under such suspicious circumstances, that it has led me to doubt the truth of his intelligence.</P>
<P>A deserter, who came in afterwards, informs me that it was given out in their camp, that they were either gone for Indians or fresh provisions: and that each transport had but twenty men on board. Upon this intelligence, I immediately wrote to governor Cooke of Rhode-Island, and to general Wooster, that they might take proper precautions for removing the cat∣tle off those islands and the coasts, and to prevent any surprise. As we are confirmed, by every account, in the scarcity of fresh provisions in the enemy's camp, and particularly by this de∣serter it is very probable this voyage may be only intended for a supply: but as it may possibly be otherwise, I thought it best to transmit the intelligence to the honorable Congress, that they may forward it to the southward, or take such other steps as they may judge proper.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, three more deserters have come out—which makes four in twenty-four hours. Their accounts correspond with those of the first who came out, and which I have related above.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the twenty-fourth July, accompanied by two hundred and eighty four commissions, which are yet much short of the necessary number. I am much honored by the confidence reposed in me, of appointing the several officers recommended in mine of the tenth ultimo; and shall endeavor to select such persons as are best qualified to fill these important posts. * * * *</P>
<P>In the renewal of these commissions, some difficulties occur, in which I should be glad to know the pleasure of the honora∣ble Congress. The general officers of the Massachusetts have regiments; those of Connecticut have both regiments and com∣panies; and the other field officers have companies each. From Rhode-Island, the general officer has no regiment, but the field
<PB N="18" REF="031423_0017_0FEC48A962E814B8"/>
officers have companies: but I do not find that they have o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expect pay, under more than one commission. Should the commissions, now to be delivered, pursue these different es∣tablishments, there will be a distinction between general and field officers of the same rank. In order to put New-Hamp∣shire, Massachusetts, and Rhode-Island, upon a line with Con∣necticut, it would be necessary to dismiss a number of officers in possession of commissions, without any fault of theirs. On the other hand, to bring the Connecticut generals and field offi∣cers to the same scale with the others, will add to the number of officers, and may be deemed inconsistent with the terms on which they entered into the service, although you add nothing to the expense, except in the article of provisions. Upon the whole, it is a case which I would wish the honorable Congress to consider and determine.</P>
<P>Colonel Gridley of this province, who is at the head of the artillery, has the rank of major-general from the provincial Congress. Will it be proper to renew his commission here in the same manner?—It is proper here to remark, that, in this case, he will take rank of all the brigadiers-general, and even the majors-general, whose commissions are subsequent in date: and this can answer no good purpose, but may be productive of many bad consequences.</P>
<P>These are matters of some importance: but I am embarrass∣ed with a difficulty of a superior kind. The estimate, made in Congress, supposed all the regiments to be formed upon one es∣tablishment; but they are different in different provinces, and even vary in the same province, in some particulars: In Massa∣chusetts, some regiments have ten companies, others eleven: the establishment of the former is five hundred and ninety men, of∣ficers included;—of the latter six hundred and forty-nine. The establishment of Rhode-Island and New Hampshire is five hundred and ninety to a regiment, officers included:—Connec∣ticut has a thousand men to a regiment. Should the Massachu∣setts regiments be completed, with the new levies from Rhode-Island and Connecticut, and the riflemen, the number will ex∣ceed twenty-two thousand. If they should not be completed,—as each regiment is fully officered, there will be a heavy ex∣pense to the public, without an adequate service. The reduc∣tion of some of them seems to be necessary, and yet is a mat∣ter of much delicacy, as we are situated. I most earnestly re∣quest it may be taken into immediate consideration, and the time and mode of doing it pointed out by the honorable Congress. By an estimate I have made from the general return,—when
<PB N="19" REF="031423_0018_0FEC4A2827A97528"/>
the new levies arrive, and the regiments are completed, there will be twenty-four thousand four hundred and fifty men on the pay and provision of the United Colonies. Some of the re∣cruiting officers, who have been out on that service, have re∣turned with very little success; so that we may safely conclude, the number of two thousand and sixty-four, now wanting to complete, will rather increase than diminish. There are the regiments of artillery, consisting of four hundred and ninety∣three men, and one under colonel Sergeant (who has not receiv∣ed any commission, although he had orders to raise a regiment, from the provincial Congress here) which are not included in the above estimate. This last regiment consists of two hundred and thirty-four men by the last return; but a company has since joined.</P>
<P>By adverting to the reneral return, which I have the honor of inclosing (No. 1), it will be seen, what regiments are most deficient.</P>
<P>If the Congress does not chuse to point out the particular re∣giments, but the provinces in wich the reduction is to be made, the several Congresses and Assemblies may be the proper chan∣nel to conduct this business, which I would also conceive the most advisable, from their better acquaintance with the merits, terms, and time of service, of the respective officers. Reduc∣ing some regiments, and, with the privates thereof, filling up others, would certainly be the best method of accomplishing this work if it were practicable: but the experiment is danger∣ous, as the Massachusetts-men, under the privilege of chusing their own officers, do not conceive themselves bound, if those officers are disbanded.</P>
<P>As general Gage is making preparations for winter by con∣tracting for quantities of coal, it will suggest to us the proprie∣ty of extending our views to that season. I have directed that such huts as have been lately made of boards should be done in such a manner, that, if necessary, they may serve for cover∣ing during the winter. But I need not enlarge upon the va∣riety of necessities, such as clothing, fuel, &amp;c. (both exceed∣ingly scarce, and difficult to be procured) which that season must bring with it, if the army or any considerable part of it is to remain embodied.</P>
<P>From the inactivity of the enemy since the arrival of their whole reinforcement,—their continual addition to their lines,—and many other circumstances,—I am inclined to think, that finding us so well prepared to receive them, the plan of opera∣tions is varied, and they mean, by regular approaches, to bom∣bard
<PB N="20" REF="031423_0019_0FEC48A5452E8DA8"/>
us o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of our present line of defence, or are waiting in expectation that the colonies must sink under the weight of the expense, or the prospect of a winter campaign so discourage our troops, as to break up our army. If they have not some such expectations, the issue of which they are determined to wait, I cannot account for the delay, when their strength is lessened every day by sickness, desertions, and little skirmishes.</P>
<P>Of these last we have had only two worthy of notice. Hav∣ing some reason to suspect they were extending their lines at Charlestown, I, last saturday evening, ordered some of the ri∣flemen down, to make a discovery, or bring off a prisoner. They were accidentally discovered sooner than they expected, by the guard coming to relieve, and obliged to fire upon them. We have reason to believe they killed several. They brought in two prisoners, whose account (confirmed by some other cir∣cumstances) removed my suspicions in part. Since that time, we have, on each side, drawn in our centries, and there have been scattering fires along the line. This evening we have heard of three captains who have been taken off by the rifle∣men, and one killed by a cannot-shot from Roxbury, besides several privates: but as the intelligence is not direct, I only mention it as a report which deserves credit. The other hap∣pened at the light-house. A number of workmen having been sent down to repair it, with a guard of twenty-two marines and a subaltern,—major Tupper, last monday morning about two o'clock, landed there with about three hundred men, attacked them, killed the officer and four privates: but being detained by the tide, in his return he was attacked by several boats; but he happily got through, with the loss of one man killed, and another wounded. The remainder of the ministerial troops (three of whom are badly wounded) he brought off prisoners, with ten tories, all of whom are on their way to Springfield-jail. The riflemen, in these skirmishes, lost one man, who (we hear) is a prisoner in Boston-jail. The enemy, in return, en∣deavored to surprise our guard at Roxbury: but they, being apprised of it by a deserter, had time to prepare for it: but by some negligence or misconduct in the officer of the guard, they burned the George tavern on the neck; and have every day since been cannonading us, from their lines, both at Roxbury and Charlestown, but with no other effect than the loss of two men. On our part, except straggling fires from the small arms about the lines, which we endeavor to restrain, we have made little or no return.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="031423_0020_0FEC4A263A55E620"/>
Our situation, in the article of powder, is much more alarm∣ing than I had the most distant idea of. Having desired a re∣turn to be made out (on my arrival) of the ammunition, I found three hundred and three barrels and a half of powder mention∣ed as in the store: but on ordering a new supply of cartridges yesterday, I was informed, to my very great astonishment, that there was no more than thirty-six barrels of the Massachusetts store, which, with the stock of Rhode-Island, New-Hampshire, and Connecticut, makes nine thousand nine hundred and thirty∣seven pounds,—not more than nine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds a man. As there had been no consumption of powder since, that could in any de∣gree account for such a deficiency, I was very particular in my inquiries, and found that the committee of supplies, not being sufficiently acquainted with the nature of a return, or misappre∣hending my request, sent in an account of all the ammunition which had been collected by the province: so that the report included not only what was in hand, but what had been spent.</P>
<P>Upon discovering this mistake, I immediately went up to confer with the speaker of the house of representatives, upon some measures to obtain a supply from the neighbouring town∣ships, in such a manner as might prevent our poverty being known; as it is a secret of too great consequence to be divulg∣ed in the general court, some individual of which might per∣haps indiscreetly suffer it to escape him, so as to find its way to the enemy,—the consequences of which are terrible even in idea. I shall also write to the governors of Rhode-Island and Connecticut, and the committee of safety in New-Hampshire, on this subject, urging, in the most forcible terms, the necessi∣ty of an immediate supply, if in their power. I need not en∣large on our melancholy situation: it is sufficient that the ex∣istence of the army and the salvation of the country depends upon something being done for our relief, both speedy and ef∣fectual, and that our situation be kept a profound secret.</P>
<P>In the inclosures, No. 2 and 3, I send the allowance of pro∣visions, &amp;c. made by the provinces of Connecticut and Massa∣chusetts. The mode and quantity are different from what has fallen within my experience; and, I am confident, must prove very wasteful and expensive. If any alteration can be safely made, (which, I much doubt) there might be a great saving to the public.</P>
<P>A gentlemen of my family, assisted by a deserter who has some skill in fortification, has by my direction sketched out two draughts of our respective lines at Charlestown and Rox∣bury,
<PB N="22" REF="031423_0021_0FEC4A1E0844E9B0"/>
which, with the explanations, will convey some idea of our situation, and, I hope, prove acceptable to the members of the honorable Congress. They are the inclosures, No. 4 and 5.</P>
<P>Since I had the honor of addressing you last, I have been ap∣plied to, by a committee of the general court, for a detachment of the army, to protect the inhabitants of the eastern parts of this province from some apprehended depredations on their coasts. I could have wished to have complied with their re∣quest: but, after due consideration, and consulting the general officers, together with the members of Congress who are here, I thought it my duty to excuse myself. The application and my answer are the inclosures, No. 6 and 7, which I hope will be approved by the honorable Congress.</P>
<P>Since I began this letter, the original, of which the inclo∣sure, No. 8, is a copy, fell into my hands. As the writer is a person of some note in Boston, and it contains some advices of importance not mentioned by others, I thought proper to for∣ward it as I received it. By comparing the hand-writing with another letter, it appears the writer is one Belcher Noyes, a person probably known to some of the gentlemen, delegates from this province, who can determine from his principles and character, what credit is due-to him.</P>
<P>The army is now formed into three grand divisions, under the command of the generals Ward, Lee, and Putnam:—each division into two brigades, consisting of about six regiments each, commanded by generals Thomas and Spencer at Roxbury,—Heath at Cambridge,—Sullivan and Greene at Winter-hill. By this, you will please to observe, there is a deficiency of one brigadier-general, (occasioned by Mr. Pomroy's not acting un∣der his commission) which I beg may be filled as soon as possi∣ble. I observe the honorable Congress have also favored me with the appointment of three brigade-majors. I presume they have or intend to appoint the rest soon, as they cannot be un∣acquainted that one is necessary to each brigade; and, in a new raised army it will be an office of great duty and service.</P>
<P>General Gage has at length liberated the people of Boston, who land in numbers at Chelsea every day. The terms on which the passes are granted, as to money, effects, and provisions, cor∣respond with Mr. Noyes' letter.</P>
<P>We have several reports that general Gage is dismantling Castle-William, and bringing all the cannon up to town: but,
<PB N="23" REF="031423_0022_0FEC4A18CDA915E8"/>
upon a very particular enquiry, accounts are so various, that I cannot ascertain the truth of it. * * * *</P>
<P>On the first instant, a chief of the Caghnawaga tribe, who lives about six miles from Montreal, came in here, accompa∣nied by a colonel Bayley of Cahoss. His accounts of the tem∣per and disposition of the Indians are very favourable. He says they have been strongly solicited by governor Carleton to engage against us; but his nation is totally averse;—that threats, as well as entreaties, have been used without effect;—that the Canadians are well-disposed to the English colonies: and if any expedition is meditated against Canada, the Indians in that quarter will give all their assistance. I have endeavored to cherish these favorable dispositions, and have recommended to him to cultivate them on his return. What I have said, I enforced with a present, which I understood would be agreea∣ble to him; as he is represented to be a man of weight and consequence in his own tribe, I flatter myself his visit will have a good effect. His account of general Carleton's force and si∣tuation at St. John's correspond with what we have already had from that quarter.</P>
<P>The accession of Georgia to the measures of the Congress is a happy event, and must give a sincere pleasure to every friend of America.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 5.—We have accounts this morning of two explo∣sions at the castle; so that its destruction may now be supposed certain.</P>
<P>I have this morning been alarmed with an information that two gentlemen from Philadelphia (Mr. Hitchbour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and captain White), with letters for general Lee and myself, have been taken by captain Ayscough at Rhode-Island, the letters in∣tercepted and sent forward to Boston,—with the bearers, as prisoners; that the captain exulted much in the discoveries he had made: and my informer (who was also in the boat, but released) understood them to the letters of consequence. I have therefore dispatched the express immediately back, though I had before resolved to detain him till Fessenden's return. I shall be anxious till I am relieved from the suspense I am in, as to the contents of those letters.</P>
<P>It is exceedingly unfortunate that gentlemen should chuse to travel the only road on which there is danger. Let the event of this be what it will, I hope it it will serve as a general cau∣tion against trusting any letters that way in future.</P>
<P>Nothing of consequence has occurred in camp these two days.—The inhabitants of Boston continue coming out at
<PB N="24" REF="031423_0023_0FEC4A2011BC9A88"/>
Chelsea, but under a new restriction, that no <HI>men</HI> shall come out without special licence, which is refused to all mechanics, since the tory labourers were taken at the light-house.</P>

<P>THE inclosed letter came under such a direction and cir∣cumstances, as led me to suppose it contained some interesting advices, either respecting a supply of powder, or the clothing lately taken at Philadelphia. I therefore took the liberty of breaking the seal, for which I hope the service and my motives will apologize.</P>
<P>As the filling up the place of vacant brigadier-general will probably be the first business of the honorable Congress, I flatter myself it will not be deemed assuming, to mention, the names of two gentlemen whose former services, rank and age, may be thought worthy of attention on this occasion. The for∣mer is colonel John Armstrong, of Pennsylvania: he served du∣ring the last war, in most of the campaigns to the southward; was honored with the command of the Pennsylvania forces, and his general military conduct and spirit much approved by all who served with him: besides which, his character was dis∣tinguished by an enterprise against the Indians, which he plan∣ned with great judgment, and executed with equal courage and success. It was not till lately that I had reason to believe he would enter again on public service; and it is now wholly un∣solicited and unknown on his part. The other gentlemen is co∣lonel Fry, of Massachusetts-Bay. He entered into the service as early as 1745, and rose through the different military ranks, in the succeeding wars, to that of colonel, until last June, when he was appointed major-general by the Congress of this pro∣vince. From these circumstances, together with the favorable report made to me of him, I presume he sustained the character of a good officer, though I do not find it distinguished by any peculiar service.</P>
<P>Either of these gentlemen, or any other whom the honorable Congress will please to favor with this appointment, will be re∣ceived by me with the utmost deference and respect.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="031423_0024_0FEC4A169A195DB0"/>
The late adjournment having made it impracticable to know the pleasure of the Congress as to the appointment of brigade-majors, beyond the number of three which they were pleased to leave me,—and the service not admitting of farther delay, I have continued the other three; which I hope their honors will not disapprove. These latter were recommended by the respec∣tive corps to which they belong, as the properest persons for these offices, until farther direction, and have discharged the du∣ty ever since. They are the majors, Box, Scammel, and Sa∣muel Brewer.</P>
<P>Last saturday night we took possession of a hill cnosiderably advanced beyond our former lines; which brought on a very heavy cannonade from Bunker's-hill, and afterwards a bombard∣ment, which has been since kept up with little spirit on their part, or damage on ours. The work having been continued ever since, is now so advanced, and the men so well covered, as to leave us under no apprehensions of much farther loss. In this affair, we had killed—one adjutant, one volunteer, and two privates. The scarcity of ammunition does not admit of our availing ourselves of the situation, as we otherwise might do: but this evil, I hope, will soon be remedied, as I have been in∣formed of the arrival of a large quantity at New-York, some at New-London, and more hourly expected at different places. I need not add to what I have already said on this subject.—Our late supply was very seasonable, but far short of our neces∣sities.</P>
<P>The late adjournment of the honorable Congress having been made before my letter of the fourth instant was received, I must now beg leave to recal their attention to those parts of it which respect the provision for the winter, the reduction of the troops, the double commissions under different establishments, and co∣lonel Gridley's appointment of major-general; in all which, I hope to be honored with their commands as soon as possible.</P>
<P>The advocate-general has sent me a memorial respecting his service, which I have the honor to inclose, (No. 1.) and from the variety and multiplicity of duty in a new army, as well as his regular service and attendance, I am induced to recommend him to the farther notice of the honorable Congress.</P>
<P>The treatment of our officers, prisoners at Boston, induced me to write to general Gage on that subject. His answer and my reply I have the honor to lay before the Congress, in the inclosures No. 2, 3, 4; since which I have heard nothing from him.</P>

<P>* * * MR. Livingston and some other gentleman from your city brought us the acceptable news of the safe arrival of a large quantity of powder, and five hundred stand of arms. Our situation is such as requires your immediate assistance and supply in that article. We have lately taken possession of a hill considerably advanced towards the enemy; but our poverty prevents our availing ourselves of any advantage of situation. I must therefore most earnestly entreat that measures may be taken to forward to this camp, in the most safe and expeditious manner, whatever ammunition can be spared from the immedi∣ate and necessary defence of the province. The value of what∣ever may be sent in consequence of this request, will be paid by order from hence when delivered, or negotiated with the honor∣able continental Congress at Philadelphia, as may be agreed with the proprietors. I only request that no time may be lost through any such difficulties, as our situation is so critical, and the exigence so great. The mode of conveyance I must leave with the provincial Congress, or the committee of the city. I doubt not they will take every precaution to make it safe and expeditious.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been in daily expectation of being favored with the commands of the honorable Congress, on the subject of my two last letters. The season now advances so fast, that I cannot any longer defer laying before them such farther mea∣sures as require their immediate attention, and in which I wait their direction,</P>
<P>The mode in which the present army has been collected has occasioned some difficulty in procuring the subscription of both officers and soldiers to the continental articles of war. Their principal objection has been, that it might subject them to long∣er service than that for which they engaged under their seve∣ral provincial establishments. It is in vain to attemt to rea∣son away the prejudices of a whole army: * * * I have therefore forbore pressing them, as I did not experience any such inconvenience from their adherence to their former rules, as would warrant the risk of entering into a contest upon it; more especially as the restraints, necessary for the establishment of essential discipline and subordination, indisposed their minds to every change, and made it both duty and policy to intro∣duce as little novelty as possible.—With the present army, I fear such a subscription is impracticable: but the difficulty will cease with this army.</P>
<P>The Connecticut and Rhode-Island troops stand engaged to the first of December only; and none longer than the first of January. A dissolution of the present army therefore will take place, unless some early provision is made against such an event. Most of the general officers are of opinion the greater part of them may be re-enlisted for the winter, or another cam∣paign, with the indulgence of a furlough to visit their friends, which may be regulated so as not to endanger the service. How far it may be proper to form the new army entirely out of the old, for another campaign, rather than from the contin∣gents of the several provinces, is a question which involves in it too many considerations of policy and prudence, for me to
<PB N="28" REF="031423_0027_0FEC47821FFD4520"/>
undertake to decide. It appears to be impossible to draw it from any other source than the old army, for this winter: and, as the pay is ample, I hope a sufficient number will engage in the service for that time at least. But there are various opini∣ons of the temper of the men on the subject; and there may be great hazard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n deferring the trial so long.</P>
<P>In the continental establishment, no provision has been made for the pay of artificers, distinct from that of the common sol∣diers; whereas, under the provincial, such as found their own tools, were allowed one shilling per diem advance, and particu∣lar artizans, more. The pay of the artillery also now differs from that of the province: the men have less, the officers more; and, for some ranks, no provision is made, as the Con∣gress will please to observe by the list which I have the honor to inclose (No. 1). These particulars, though seemingly in∣considerable, are the source of much complaint and dissatisfac∣tion, which I endeavor to compose in the best manner I am able.</P>
<P>By the return of the rifle companies, and that battalion, they appear to exceed their establishment very considerably. I doubt my authority to pay these extra men without the directi∣on of the Congress: but it would be deemed a great hardship, wholly to refuse them, as they have been encouraged to come.</P>
<P>The necessities of the troops having required pay, I directed that those of the Massachusetts should receive for one month upon their being mustered, and returning a proper roll: but a claim was immediately made for pay by lunar months; and se∣veral regiments have declined taking up their warrants on this account. As this practice was entirely new to me, though said to be warranted by former usage, here the matter now waits the determination of the honorable Congress. I find, in Connecti∣cut and Rhode-Island, this point was settled by calendar months; in Massachusetts, though mentioned in Congress, it was left undetermined; which is also the case of New-Hamp∣shire.</P>
<P>The inclosure No. 2, is a petition from the subalterns, respect∣ing their pay. Where there are only two of these in a compa∣ny, I have considered one as an ensign, and ordered him pay as such, as in the Connecticut forces. I must beg leave to recom∣mend this petition to the favor of the Congress: as I am of o∣pinion the allowance is inadequate to their rank and service, and is one great source, of that familiarity between the officers and men, which is so compatible with subordination and disci∣pline. Many valuable officers of those ranks, finding themselves
<PB N="29" REF="031423_0028_0FEC489EB3599588"/>
unable to support the character and appearance of officers (I am informed) will retire as soon as the term of service is expired, if there is no alteration.</P>
<P>For the better regulation of duty, I found it necessary to set∣tle the rank of the officers, and to number the regiments; and, as I had not received the command of the Congress on the subject, and the exigence of the service forbade any further de∣lay, the general officers were considered as having no regi∣ments,—an alteration, which, I understand, is not pleasing to some of them, but appeared to me and others to be proper, when it was considered, that, by this means, the whole army is put upon one footing, and all particular attachments dissolved.</P>
<P>Among many other considerations which the approach of winter will demand, that of clothing appears to be one of the most important. So far as regards the preservation of the ar∣my from cold, they may be deemed in a state of nakedness. Many of the men have been without blankets the whole cam∣paign: and those which have been in use during the summer, are so much worn as to be of little service. In order to make a suitable provision in these articles, and at the same time to guard the public against imposition and expense, it seems neces∣sary to determine the mode of continuing the army: for, should these troops be clothed under their present engagement, and at the expiration of the term of service, decline renewing it, a set of unprovided men may be sent to supply their places.</P>
<P>I cannot suppose it to be unknown to the honorable Congress that, in all armies, it is an established practice to make an al∣lowance to officers, of provisions and forage, proportionnte to their rank. As such an allowance formed no part of the con∣tinental establishment, I have hitherto forbore to issue the or∣ders for that purpose: but, as it is a received opinion of such members of the Congress as I have had an opportunity of con∣sulting, as well as throughout the army, that it must be deem∣ed a matter of course, and implied in the establishment of the army, I have directed the following proportion of rations, being the same allowed in the American armies last war:—major-general, fifteen; brigadier-general, twelve; colonel, six; lieu∣tenant-colonel, five; major, four; captain, three; subaltern, two; staff, two.</P>
<P>If these should not be approved by the honorable Congress, they will please to signify their pleasure, as to the alterations they would have made in the whole or in part.</P>
<P>I am now to inform the honorable Congress, that, encourag∣ed by the repeated declarations of the Canadians and Indians,
<PB N="30" REF="031423_0029_0FEC47F91612C990"/>
and urged by their requests, I have detached colonel Arnold with a thousand men, to penetrate into Canada by way of Ken∣nebeck river, and, if possible to make himself master of Quebec. By this manoeuvre, I proposed either to divert Carleton from St. John's, which would leave a free passage to general Schuy∣ler;—or, if this did not take effect, Quebec, in its present de∣fenceless state, must fall into his hands an easy prey. I made all possible enquiry, as to the distance, the safety of the route, and the danger of the season being too far advanced; but found no∣thing in either, to deter me from proceeding, more especially as it met with very general approbation from all whom I consulted upon it. But, that nothing might be omitted, to enable me to judge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> propriety and probable consequences, I communi∣cated it by express to general Schuyler, who approved of it in such terms, that I resolved to put it in immediate execution. They have now left this place seven days; and, if favored with a good wind, I hope soon to hear of their being safe at Kenne-beck river. For the satisfaction of the Congress, I here inclose a copy of the proposed route (No. 3). I also do myself the ho∣nor of inclosing a manifesto, which I caused to be printed here, and of which colonel Arnold has taken a suitable number with him. This is the inclosure, No. 4. I have also forwarded a copy of his instructions (No. 5):—from all which, I hope the Congress will have a clear view of the motives, plan, and in∣tended execution of this enterprise, and that I shall be so hap∣py as to meet with their approbation in it.</P>
<P>I was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more induced to make this detachment, as it is my clear opinion, from a careful observation of the movements of the enemy, corroborated by all the intelligence we receive by deserters and others, (of the former of whom we have some e∣very day) that the enemy have no intention to come out, until they are reinforced. They have been wholly employed for some time past in procuring materials for barracks, fuel, and making other preparations for winter. These circumstances, with the constant additions to their works which are apparently defensive, have led to the above conclusion, and enabled me to spare this body of men where I hope they will be usefully and successfully employed.</P>
<P>The state of inactivity, in which this army has lain for some time, by no means corresponds with my wishes, by some decisive stroke to relieve my country from the heavy expense its sub∣sistence must create. After frequently reconnoitring the situa∣tion of the enemy the town of Boston, collecting all possible intelligence, and digesting the whole, a surprise did not appear
<PB N="31" REF="031423_0030_0FEC4A149BE73040"/>
to me wholly impracticable, though hazardous. I communicat∣ed it to the general officers some days before I called them to a council, that they might be prepared with their opinions. The result I have the honor of inclosing (No. 6). I cannot say that I have wholly laid it aside: but new events may occasion new measures. Of this I hope the honorable Congress can need no assurance, that there is not a man in America who more earnest∣ly wishes such a termination of the campaign, as to make the army no longer necessary.</P>
<P>The season advances so fast, that I have given orders to pre∣pare barracks and other accommodations for the winter. The great scarcity of tow-cloth in this country, I fear, will totally disappoint us in our expectations of procuring hunting-shirts.—Governor Cooke informs me, few or none are to be had in Rhode-Island; and governor Trumbull gives me little encou∣ragement to expect many from Connecticut.</P>
<P>I have filled up the office of quarter-master-general, which the Congress was pleased to leave to me, by the appointment of major Mifflin, which I hope and believe will be universally ac∣ceptable.</P>
<P>It gives me great pain to be obliged to solicit the attention of the honorable Congress to the state of this army, in terms which imply the slightest apprehension of being neglected. But my situation is inexpressibly distressing, to see the winter fast approaching upon a naked army; the time of their service with∣in a few weeks of expiring; and no provision yet made for such important events. Added to these, the military chest is totally exhausted: the paymaster has not a single dollar in hand: the commissary-general assures me he has strained his credit, for the subsistence of the army, to the utmost. The quarter-master-ge∣neral is precisely in the same situation; and the greater part of the troops not far from mutiny, upon the deduction of their sta∣ted allowance. I know not to whom I am to impute this fail∣ure: but I am opinion, if the evil is not immediately remedi∣ed, and more punctually observed in future, the army must ab∣solutely break up. I hope I have so fully expressed myself on this subject (both by letter, and to those members of the Con∣gress who honored the camp with a visit), that no disappoint∣ment could possibly happen: I therefore hourly expected ad∣vice from the paymaster that he had received a fresh supply, in addition to the hundred and seventy-two thousand dollars deli∣vered him in August: and thought myself warranted to assure the public creditors that in a few days they should be satisfied. But the delay has brought matters to such a crisis, as admits of
<PB N="32" REF="031423_0031_0FEC47F724EE6FF0"/>
no further uncertain expectation. I have therefore sent off this express, with orders to make all possible dispatch. It is my most earnest request that he may be returned with all possible expedition, unless the honorable Congress have already forwar∣ded what is so indispensably necessary.</P>

<P>THE reverend Mr. Kirkland, the bearer of this, having been introduced to the honorable Congress, can need no parti∣cular recommendation from me. But as he now wishes to have the affair of his mission and public employ put upon some suita∣ble footing, I cannot but intimate my sense of the importance of his station, and the great advantages which have and may re∣sult to the United Colonies, from his situation being made re∣spectable.</P>
<P>All accounts agree that much of the favorable disposition shewn by the Indians, may be ascribed to his labor and influence. He has accompanied a chief of the Oneidas to this camp, which I have endeavored to make agreeable to him, both by civility and some small presents. Mr. Kirkland being also in some ne∣cessity for money to bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his travelling charges and other ex∣penses, I have supplied him with thirty-two pounds lawful mo∣ney.</P>
<P>I cannot but congratulate the honorable Congress on the hap∣py temper of the Canadians and Indians, our accounts of which are now fully confirmed by some intercepted letters from offi∣cers in Canada to general Gage and others in Boston, which were found on board the vessel lately taken, going into Boston with a donation of cattle and other fresh provisions for the ministeri∣al army.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored with your favor of the twenty-sixth ul∣timo, late the night before last; and a meeting of the general officers having been called upon a business which will make a considerable part of this letter, I took the opportunity of lay∣ing before them those parts of yours which respect the continu∣ance and new-modelling of the army, the fuel, clothing, and other preparations for the ensuing winter. They have taken
<PB N="33" REF="031423_0032_0FEC4A5AF1FF5CB8"/>
two or three days to consider; and, as soon as I am possessed of their opinions, I shall lose no time in transmitting the result, not only on the above subjects, but the number of troops necessary to be kept up.</P>
<P>I have also directed the commissary-general and the quarter master-general to prepare estimates of the expence of their de∣partments for a certain given number of men, from which a judg∣ment may be made, when the number of men, to be kept in pay is determined:—all which I shall do myself the honor to lay before the Congress, as soon as they are ready.</P>
<P>I have now a painful, though a necessary duty to perform, re∣specting Dr. Church, director-general of the hospital. About a week ago, Mr. secretary Ward of Providence, sent up to me one Wainwood, an inhabitant of Newport, with a letter direct∣ed to Major Cane in Boston, in [<HI>accult</HI>] characters, which he said had been left with Wainwood some time ago, by a woman who was kept by Dr. Church. She had before pressed Wain∣wood to take her to captain Wallace, Mr. Dudley the collec∣tor, or George Rome; which he declined. She then gave him the letter, with a strict charge to deliver it to either of those gentlemen. He suspecting some improper correspondence, kept the letter, and after some time opened it; but, not being able to read it, laid it up, where it remained until he received an obscure letter from the woman, expressing an anxiety after the original letter. He then communicated the whole matter to Mr. Ward, who sent him up with the papers to me. I imme∣diately secured the woman; but for a long time she was proof against every threat and persuasion to discover the author.—However, at length she was brought to a confession, and named Dr. Church. I then immediately secured him and all his pa∣pers. Upon his first examination, he readily acknowledged the letter, said it was designed for his brother Fleming, and, when deciphered, would be found to contain nothing criminal. He acknowledged his never having communicated the correspond∣ence to any person here but the girl, and made many protesta∣tions of the purity of his intentions. Having found a person ca∣pable of deciphering the letter, I, in the mean time, had all his papers searched, but found nothing criminal among them: but it appeared on enquiry, that a confident had been among the papers before my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>enger arrived. I then called the gene∣ral officers together for their advice, the result of which you will find in the inclosure, No. 1. The deciphered letter is the inclosure No. 2. The army and country are exceedingly irri∣tated; and upon a free discussion of the nature, circumstances,
<PB N="34" REF="031423_0033_0FEC4A6771B357C8"/>
and consequence of this matter, it has been unanimously agreed to lay it before the honorable Congress for their special advice and direction; at the same time suggesting to their consideration, whether an alteration of the twenty-eighth article of war may not be necessary.</P>
<P>As I shall reserve all further remarks upon the state of the army till my next, I shall now beg leave to request the deter∣mination of Congress, as to the property and disposal of such vessels and cargoes as are designed for the supply of the enemy, and may fall into our hands. There has been an event of this kind at Portsmouth (as by the inclosure, No. 3), in which I have directed the cargo to be brought hither for the use of the army, reserving the settlement of any claims of capture to the decision of Congress.</P>
<P>As there are many unfortunate individuals whose property has been confiscated by the enemy, I would humbly suggest to the consideration of Congress the humanity of applying, in part or in the whole, such captures to the relief of those sufferers, after compensating any expence of the captors, and for their ac∣tivity and spirit. I am the more induced to request this deter∣mination may be speedy, as I have directed three vessels to be equipped in order to cut off the supplies; and, from the num∣ber of vessels hourly arriving, it may become an object of some importance. In the disposal of these captures, for the encou∣ragement of the officers and men, I have allowed them one-third of the cargoes, except military stores, which, with the vessels, are to be reserved for the public use. I hope my plan, as well as the execution, will be favored with the approbation of Congress.</P>
<P>One Mr. Fisk, an intelligent person, came out of Boston on the third instant, and gives us the following advices:—that a fleet, consisting of a sixty-four, and twenty-gun ship, two sloops of eighteen guns, and two transports with six hundred men, were to sail from Boston as yesterday; that they took on board two mortars, four howitzers, and other artillery, calculated for the bombardment of a town:—their destination was kept a profound secret:—that an express sloop of war, which left En∣gland the eighth August, arrived four days ago;—that gene∣ral Gage is recalled, and last sunday, resigned his command to General Howe;—that Lord Percy, colonel Smith, and other offi∣cers who were at Lexington, are ordered home with Gage;—that six ships of the line and two cutters were coming out un∣der sir Peter Dennis;—that five regiments and a thousand ma∣rines are ordered out, and may be expected in three or four
<PB N="35" REF="031423_0034_0FEC4A6979E5CAE8"/>
weeks:—no prospect of accommodation; but the ministry deter∣mined to push the war to the utmost.</P>
<P>I have an express from colonel Arnold, and herewith send a copy of his letter and an inclosure, No. 4 and 5.—I am happy in finding he meets with no discouragement.—The claim of the rifle officers, to be independent of all the superior officers, ex∣cept colonel Arnold, is without any countenance or authority from me, as I have signified in my last dispatch both to colonel Arnold and captain Morgan.—The captain of the brig from Quebec for Boston, informs me, that there is no suspicion of any such expedition; and that, if Carleton is not driven from St. John's, so as to be obliged to throw himself into Quebec, it must fall into our hands, as it is left without a regular soldier, and many of the inhabitants are most favourably disposed to the American cause;—and that there is the largest stock of ammunition ever collected in America.</P>
<P>In the above vessel some letters were also found, from an officer at Quebec, to General Gage and major Sheriff at Bos∣ton, containing such an account of the temper of the Canadi∣ans, as cannot but afford the highest satisfaction. I have thought it best to forward them: they are the inclosures, No. 6 and 7.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with your several favors of the twenty-sixth and thirtieth September, and fifth October, the contents of which I shall beg leave to notice in their respective order.</P>
<P>Previous to the direction of Congress to consult the general officers on the best mode of continuing and providing for the army during the winter, I had desired them to turn their thoughts upon these subjects, and to favor me with the result, by a particular day, in writing. In this interval, the appointment of Dr. Frank∣lin, Mr. Lynch, and colonel Harrison, was communicated,—an event, which has given me the highest satisfaction, as the subject was too weighty and complex for a discussion by letter. This appointment made any conclusion here unnecessary, as it is not probable any such arrangement would be agreed on, as would not be altered in some respects, upon a full and free conference. This good effect will arise from the step already taken, that every officer will be prepared to give his sentiments upon these important subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="031423_0035_0FEC4A6E88600EE8"/>
The estimates of the commissary and quarter-master-general I have now the honor of inclosing. The first is No. 1,—the other No. 2.</P>
<P>With respect to the reduction of the pay of the men, which may enter into the consideration of their support, it is the unani∣mous opinion of the general officers, that it cannot be touched with safety at present. * * *</P>
<P>Upon the presumption of there being a vacancy in the direction of the hospital, lieutenant-colonel Hand, formerly a surgeon in the eighteenth regiment of royal Irish, and Dr. Foster, late of Charlestown, and one of the surgeons of the hospital under Dr. Church, are candidates for that office. I do not pretend to be acquainted with their respective merits, and therefore have given them no farther expectation, than that they should be mentioned as candidates for the department. I therefore need only to add upon this subject, that the affairs of the hospital require that the appointment should be made as soon as possible.</P>
<P>Before I was honored with your favor of the fifth instant, I had given orders for the equipment of some armed vessels, to in∣tercept the enemy's supplies of provisions and ammunition. One of them was on a cruise between Cape Anne and Cape Cod, when the express arrived. The others will be fit for the sea in a few days, under the command of officers of the continental army, who are well recommended, as persons acquainted with the sea, and capable of such a service. Two of these will be immedi∣ately dispatched on this duty; and every particular, mentioned in your favor of the fifth instant, literally complied with.</P>
<P>That the honorable Congress may have a more complete idea of the plan on which these vessels are equipped, I inclose a copy of the instructions given to the captains now out, (No. 4). These, with the additional instructions directed, will be given to the captains who go into the mouth of St. Lawrence's river. As both officers and men most cheerfully engage in the service on the terms mentioned in these instructions, I fear that the proposed increase will create some difficulty, by making a dif∣ference between men engaged on similar service. I have there∣fore not yet communicated this part of the plan, but reserved an extra bounty as a reward for extraordinary activity. There are no armed vessels in this province; and governor Cooke informs me the enterprise can receive no assistance from him, as one of the armed vessels of Rhode-Island is on a long cruise, and the other unfit for service. Nothing shall be omitted to secure success. A fortunate capture of an ordnance ship would give new life to the camp, and an immediate turn to the issue of the campaign.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="031423_0036_0FEC4A72E1D8CF68"/>
Our last accounts from colonel Arnold are very favorable: he was proceeding with all expedition; and I flatter myself (making all allowances) he will be at Quebec the twentieth in∣stant, where a gentleman from Canada (Mr. * * *) assures me he will meet with no resistance.</P>
<P>In the quarter-master's estimate, there are some articles omitted, of which he informs me he cannot pretend to furnish a compu∣tation,—such as cartage, tools, &amp;c. for which some general allow∣ance must be made.</P>
<P>From the various accounts received from Europe, there may be reason to expect troops will be landed at New-York, or some other middle colony. I should be glad to know the pleasure of the Congress, whether, upon such an event, it would be ex∣pected that a part of this army should be detached, or the internal force of such colony and its neighbourhood be deemed sufficient; or whether, in such case, I am to wait the particular direction of Congress.</P>
<P>The fleet, mentioned in my last, has been seen standing N. N. E. so that we apprehend it is intended for some part of this province, or New-Hampshire, or possibly Quebec.</P>
<P>The latest and best accounts we have from the enemy, are, that they are engaged in their new work across the south end of Boston, preparing their barracks, &amp;c. for winter:—that it is pro∣posed to keep from five hundred to a thousand men on Bunker's hill all winter, who are to be relieved once a week;—the rest to be drawn into Boston.</P>
<P>A person who has lately been a servant to major Conolly, (a tool of Lord Dunmore's) has given an account of a scheme to distress the southern provinces, which appeared to me of sufficient consequence to be immediately transmitted. I have therefore got it attested, and do myself the honor of inclosing it, No. 5.</P>
<P>The new levies from Connecticut have lately marched into camp, and are a body of as good troops as any we have: so that we have now the same strength, as before the detachment made under colonel Arnold.</P>
<P>I am, with the most respectful sentiments to the honorable Con∣gress, and yourself, sir, your most obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>MY conjecture of the destination of the late squadron from Boston, in my last, has been unhappily verified by an out∣rage, exceeding, in barbarity and cruelty, every hostile act practised among civilised nations. I have enclosed the account given me by Mr. Jones, a gentleman of the town of Falmouth, of the destruction of that increasing and flourishing village. He is a very great sufferer, and informs me that the time allowed for the removal of effects was so small, that valuable property of all kinds, and to a great amount, has been destroyed. The or∣ders shewn by the captain for this horrid procedure, (by which it appears the same desolation is meditated upon all the towns on the coast) made it my duty to communicate it as quickly and extensively as possible. As Portsmouth was the next place to which he proposed to go, general Sullivan was permitted to go up, and give them his assistance and advice to ward off the blow. I flatter myself the like event will not happen there, as they have a fortification of some strength, and a vessel has ar∣rived at a place called Sheepscot, with fifteen hundred pounds of powder.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the Congress have nearly finished their business: but as they write by this opportunity, I must beg leave to refer you to their letter, for what concerns their com∣mission.</P>
<P>We have had no occurrence of any consequence in the camp since I had the honor of addressing you last; but expect every hour to hear that Newport has shared the fate of unhappy Fal∣mouth.</P>

<P>The information, which the gentlemen who have lately gone from hence can give the Congress, of the state and situation of the army, would have made a letter unnecessary, if I did not suppose there would be some anxiety to know the intentions of the army on the subject of the re-enlistment.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the advice of those gentlemen, and my own opinion, I immediately began by directing all such officers as proposed to continue, to signify their intentions as soon as pos∣sible. A great number of the returns are come in, from which I find that a very great proportion of the officers of the rank
<PB N="39" REF="031423_0038_0FEC4A76E5575380"/>
of captains, and under, will retire;—from present appearances, I may say, half,—but at least, one third. It is with some con∣cern also that I observe, that many of the officers who retire, discourage the continuance of the men, and, I fear, will com∣municate the infection to them. Some have advised that those officers who decline the service should be immediately dismiss∣ed; but this would be very dangerous and inconvenient. I confess I have great anxieties upon the subject, though I still hope the pay and terms are so advantageous, that interest, and, I hope also, a regard to their country, will retain a greater proportion of privates than their officers. In so important a mat∣ter, I shall esteem it my indispensable duty, not only to act with all possible prudence, but to give the most early and constant ad∣vice of my progress.</P>
<P>A supply of cloathing, equal to our necessities, would greatly contribute to the encouragement and satisfaction of the men. In every point of view, it is so important that I beg leave to call the attention of the Congress to it in a particular manner.</P>

<P>I COULD not suffer Mr. Randolph to quit this camp with∣out bearing some testimony of my duty to the Congress; although his sudden departure (occasioned by the death of his worthy re∣lative, whose loss, as a good citizen, and valuable member of society, is much to be regretted) does not allow me time to be particular.</P>
<P>The inclosed return shews, at one view, what reliance we have upon the officers of this army, and how deficient we are like to be in subaltern officers. A few days more will enable me to inform the Congress what they have to expect from the soldiery, as I shall issue recruiting orders for this purpose, so soon as the officers are appointed,—which will be done this day,—having sent for the general officers, to consult them in the choice.</P>
<P>I must beg leave to recall the attention of the Congress to the appointment of a brigadier-general,—an officer as necessary to a brigade, as a colonel is to a regiment, and will be exceedingly wanted in the new arrangement.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The immediate occasion of my giving the Congress the trouble of a letter at this time is to inform them, that, in con∣sequence of their order, signified in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, I laid myself under a solemn tie of secrecy to captain M'Pherson, and proceeded to examine his plan for the destruc∣tion of the fleet in the harbor of Boston, with all that care and attention which the importance of it deserved, and my judgment could lead to. But not being happy enough to coincide in opi∣nion with that gentleman, and finding that his scheme would in∣volve greater expence, than (under my doubts of its success) I thought myself justified in giving into, I prevailed upon him to communicate his plan to three gentlemen of the artillery in this army, well acquainted in the knowledge and practice of gunnery. By them he has been convinced, that, inasmuch as he set out upon wrong principles, the scheme would prove abortive. Un∣willing, however, to relinquish his favourite project of reducing the naval force of Great-Britain, he is very desirous of build∣ing a number of row gallies for this purpose. But as the Con∣gress alone are competent to the adoption of this measure, I have advised him-(although he offered to go on with the building of them at his own expence, till the Congress should decide) to repair immediately to Philadelphia with his proposals; where, if they should be agreed to, or vessels of superior force, agreeable to the wishes of most others, should be resolved on, he may set instantly about them, with all the materials upon the spot:—here, they are to collect.—To him therefore I refer for further informa∣tion on this head.</P>
<P>A vessel, said to be from Philadelphia and bound to Boston, with a hundred and twenty pipes of wine (a hundred and eigh∣teen of which are secured) stranded at a place called Eastham, in a gale of wind, on the second instant;—another, from Boston, to Halifax, with dry goods &amp;c. (amounting, per invoice, to about two hundred and forty pounds lawful money) got disabled in the same gale, near Beverly. These cargoes, with the papers, I have
<PB N="41" REF="031423_0040_0FEC4A7F11EF4348"/>
ordered to this place,—the vessels to be taken care of till fur∣ther orders. I have also an account of the taking of a wood∣sloop bound to Boston, and carried into Portsmouth by one of our armed vessels;—particulars not yet come to hand;—and this instant, of two others, from Nova-Scotia to Boston, with hay, wood, live stock, &amp;c. by another of our armed schooners.—These are in Plymouth.</P>
<P>These accidents and captures point out the necessity of establish∣ing proper courts without loss of time, for the decision of property, and the legality of seizures; otherwise I may be involved in in∣extricable difficulties.</P>
<P>Our prisoners, by the reduction of Fort Chamblee (on which happy event I most sincerely congratulate the Congress), being considerably augmented, and likely to be increased, I submit it to the wisdom of Congress, whether some convenient inland towns, remote from the post-roads, ought not to be assigned them; the manner of their treatment, subsistence, &amp;c. defin∣ed; and a commissary or agent appointed, to see that justice is done both to them and the public, proper accounts rendered, &amp;c. Without a mode of this sort is adopted, I fear there will be sad confusion hereafter, as there are great complaints at pre∣sent.</P>
<P>I reckoned without my host, when I informed the Congress in my last, that I should in a day or two be able to acquaint them of the disposition of the soldiery towards a new enlistment-I have been in consultation with the generals of this army ever since Thursday last, endeavoring to establish new corps of offi∣cers; but find so many doubts and difficulties to reconcile, that I cannot say when they are to end, or what may be the conse∣quences; as there appears to be such an unwillingness in the officers of one government mixing in the same regiment with those of another; and, without it, many must be dismissed, who are willing to serve; notwithstanding, we are deficient on the whole.</P>
<P>The council of Officers are unanimously of opinion that the command of the artillery should no longer continue in colonel * * *; and knowing of no person better qualified to supply his place, or whose appointment will give more general satis∣faction, have taken the liberty of recommending Henry Knox, esquire, to the consideration of Congress, thinking it indispensa∣bly necessary, at the same time, that this regiment should con∣sist of two lieutenant-colonels, two majors, and twelve compa∣nies, agreeable to the plan and estimate handed in; which dif∣fering
<PB N="42" REF="031423_0041_0FEC4A828313E720"/>
from the last establishment, I should be glad to be instruct∣ed on.</P>
<P>The commissary-general not being returned, will apologise, I hope, for my silence respecting a requisition of the expence of his clerks, &amp;c. which I was to have obtained together with others, and forwarded.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing of colonel Arnold since the thirteenth ultimo. His letter of, and journal to that date, will convey all the information I am able to give of him. I think he must be in Quebec. If any mischance had happened to him, he would, as directed, have forwarded an express.—No account yet of the arm∣ed vessels sent to St. Laurence.—I think they will meet the stores inward or outward bound.</P>
<P>Captain Symons, in the Cerberus, lately sent from Boston to Falmouth, hath published the inclosed declaration at that place; and it is suspected he intends to make some kind of a lodgment there. I wrote immediately to colonel Finnie, of this army, who went up there upon the last alarm, to spirit up the people and oppose it at all events.—Falmouth is about a hundred and thirty miles from this camp.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>* * * Inclosed, you have a copy of an act, passed this ses∣sion, by the honorable council and house of representatives of this province. It respects such captures as may be made by vessels fitted out by the province, or by individuals thereof.—As the armed vessels, fitted out at the continental expence, do not come under this law, I would have it submitted to the consi∣deration of Congress, to point out a more summary way of pro∣ceeding, to determine the property and mode of condemnation of such prizes as have been or hereafter may be made, than is speci∣fied in this act.</P>
<P>Should not a court be established by authority of Congress, to take cognisance of prizes made by the continental vessels?—Whatever the mode is which they are pleased to adopt, there is an absolute necessity of its being speedily determined on: for I cannot spare time from military affairs, to give proper attention to these matters.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Plymouth have taken a sloop, laden with
<PB N="43" REF="031423_0042_0FEC4A8467A85FD0"/>
provisions, &amp;c. from Halifax, bound to Boston, and the inha∣bitants of Beverly have, under cover of one of the armed schoon∣ers, taken a vessel from Ireland, laden with beef, pork, butter, &amp;c. for the same place. The latter brings papers and letters of a very interesting nature, which are in the hands of the ho∣norable council, who informed me they will transmit them to you by this conveyance. To the contents of these papers and letters, I must beg leave to refer you and the honorable Con∣gress, who will now see the absolute necessity there is, of exert∣ing all their wisdom, to withstand the mighty efforts of our enemies.</P>
<P>The trouble I have in the arrangement of the army is really inconceivable. Many of the officers sent in their names to serve, in expectation of promotion; others stood aloof * * *; whilst a number who have declined, have again sent in their names, to serve. So great has the confusion, arising from these and many other perplexing circumstances, been, that I found it absolutely impossible to fix this very interesting business exactly on the plan resolved on in the conference, though I have kept up to the spirit, as near as the nature and necessity of the case would admit of; the difficulty with the soldiers is as great,—indeed more so, if possible, than with the officers. They will not enlist, until they know their colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, captain, &amp;c. so that it was necessary to fix the officers the first thing; which is, at last, in some manner done; and I have given out enlisting orders.</P>
<P>You, sir, can much easier judge, than I can express, the anx∣iety of mind I must labor under on the occasion, especially at this time, when we may expect the enemy will begin to act on the arrival of their reinforcement, part of which is already come, and the remainder daily dropping in.</P>
<P>I have other distresses of a very alarming nature. The arms of our soldiery are so exceeding bad, that I assure you, sir, I cannot place a proper confidence in them. Our powder is wast∣ing fast, notwithstanding the strictest care, economy, and at∣tention is paid to it. The long series of wet weather we have had, renders the greater part of what has been served out to the men, of no use. Yesterday I had a proof of it, as a party of the enemy, about four or five hundred, taking the advan∣tage of a high tide, landed at Leechmore's point: we were a∣larmed, and of course ordered every man to examine his car∣touch-box; when the melancholy truth appeared; and we were obliged to furnish the greater part of them with fresh ammuni∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="031423_0043_0FEC4A8C00755EE0"/>
The damage done at the point was the taking of a man who watched a few horses and cows; ten of the latter they carried off. Colonel Thompson marched down with his regiment of riflemen, and was joined by colonel Woodbridge, with a part of his and a part of Patterson's regiment, who gallantly waded through the water, and soon obliged the enemy to embark un∣der cover of a man-of-war, a floating battery, and the fire of a battery on Charlestown neck. We have two of our men dan∣gerously wounded by grape shot from the man-of-war, and, by a flag sent out this day, we are informed the enemy lost two of their men.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I received your favors of the seventh and tenth instant, with the resolves of the honorable Congress, to which I will pay all due attention.—As soon as two capable persons can be found, I will dispatch them to Nova-Scotia, on the service resolved on in Congress.</P>
<P>The resolve to raise two battalions of marines will (if practi∣cable in this army) entirely derange what has been done. It is therein mentioned, "one colonel for the two battalions."—of course, a colonel must be dismissed. One of the many diffi∣culties, which attended the new arrangement, was in reconcil∣ing the different interests, and judging of the merits of the dif∣ferent colonels.—In the dismission of this one, the same difficul∣ties will occur.—The officers and men must be acquainted with maritime affairs; to comply with which, they must be picked out of the whole army,—one from this corps, one from another,—so as to break through the whole system, which has cost us so much time, anxiety and pains, to bring into any to∣lerable form. Notwithstanding any difficulties which will arise, you may be assured, sir, that I will use every endeavor to comply with their resolve.</P>
<P>I beg leave to submit it to the consideration of Congress (if these two battalions can be formed out of this army) whether this is a time to weaken our lines, by employing any of the for∣ces appointed to defend them, on any other service. The gen∣tlemen who were here from the Congress know their vast ex∣tent: they must know that we shall have occasion for our whole force for that purpose; more so now than at any past time, as we may expect the enemy will take the advantage of the first
<PB N="45" REF="031423_0044_0FEC4A8F40273EE0"/>
hard weather, and attempt to make an impression somewhere. That this is their intention, we have many reasons to suspect.</P>
<P>We have had, in the last week, six deserters, and took two straggling prisoners. They all agree that two companies, with a train of artillery and one of the regiments from Ireland, were ar∣rived at Boston;—that fresh ammunition and flints have been serv∣ed out;—that the grenadiers and light infantry had orders to hold themselves in readiness at a moment's warning.</P>
<P>As there is every appearance that this contest will not be soon decided, and of course that there must be an augmentation of the continental army, would it not be eligible to raise two battalions of marines in New-York and Philadelphia, where there must be numbers of sailors now unemployed?—This however is matter of opinion, which I mention with all due deference to the superior judgment of the Congress.</P>
<P>Inclosed, you have copies of two letters,—one from colonel Arnold,—the other from colonel * * *. I can form no judg∣ment on the latter's conduct, until I see him. Notwithstanding the great defection, I do not dispair of colonel Arnold's success. He will have, in all probability, many more difficulties to en∣counter, than if he had been a fortnight sooner; as it is likely that governor Carleton will, with what forces he can collect after the surrender of the rest of Canada, throw himself into Quebec, and there make his last effort. There is no late account from captains Broughton and Sillman, sent to the river St. Laurence. The other cruisers have been chiefly confined to harbor, by the badness of the weather. The same reason has caused great delay in building of our barracks; which, with a most morti∣fying scarcity of fire-wood, discourages the men from enlist∣ing. The last, I am afraid, is an insuperable obstacle. I have applied to the honorable house of representatives of this province, who were pleased to appoint a committee to negotiate this bu∣siness; and notwithstanding all the pains they have and are ta∣king, they find it impossible to supply our necessities. The want of a sufficient number of teams, I understand to be the chief im∣pediment.</P>
<P>I got returns this day from eleven colonels, of the numbers enlisted in their regiments. The whole amount is nine hundred and sixty-six men. There must be some other stimulus besides love for their country, to make men fond of the service. It would be a great encouragement, and no additional expence to the continent, were they to receive pay for the months of Oc∣tober and November; also a month's pay advance. The pre∣sent
<PB N="46" REF="031423_0045_0FEC4A9429F72DE8"/>
state of the military chest will not admit of this. The sooner it is enabled to do so, the better.</P>
<P>The commissary-general is daily expected in camp. I cannot send you the estimate of the clerks in his department, until he ar∣rives.</P>
<P>I sincerely congratulate you upon the success of your arms, in the surrender of St. John's, which I hope is a happy presage of the reduction of the rest of Canada.</P>

<P>I HAD the honor of writing to you on the nineteenth instant. I have now to inform you that Henry Knox, esquire, is gone to New-York, with orders to forward to this place what cannon and ordnance stores can be there procured. From thence he will proceed to general Schuyler on the same business, as you will see by the inclosed copy of instructions which I have given him. It would give me much satisfaction, that this gen∣tleman, or any other whom you may think qualified, was ap∣pointed to the command of the artillery regiment. In my let∣ter to you, of the eighth instant, I have expressed myself ful∣ly on this subject, which I beg leave to recommend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your immediate attention; as the formation of that corps will be at a stand, until I am honored with your instructions thereon. * * * *</P>
<P>There are two persons engaged to go Nova-Scotia, on the business recommended in your last. By the best information we have from thence, the stores, &amp;c. have been withdrawn some time. Should this not be the case, it is next to an impossibility to attempt any thing there, in the present unsettled and precarious state of the army. * * *</P>
<P>From what I can collect in my enquiries amongst the officers, it will be impossible to get the men to enlist for the continuance of the war; which will be an insuperable obstruction to the forma∣tion of the two battallions of marines on the plan resolved on in Congress. As it can make no difference, I propose to proceed ceed on the new arrangement of the army, and, when completed, inquire out such officers and men as are best qualified for that service, and endeavor to form these two battalions out of the whole. This appears to me the best method, and will, I hope, meet the approbation of Congress.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="031423_0046_0FEC4A95E7246E78"/>
As it will be very difficult for the men to work when the hard frost sets in, I have thought it necessary (though of little use at present) to take possession of Coble-hill, for the benefit of any future operations. It was effected, without the least opposition from the enemy, the twenty-third instant. Their inactivity on this occasion is what I cannot account for:—it is probable they are meditating a blow somewhere.</P>
<P>About three hundred men, women and children, of the poor inhabitants of Boston, came out to Point-Shirley last Friday—They have brought their household furniture, but are unprovided of every other necessary of life. I have recommended them to the attention of the committee of the honorable council of this province now sitting at Watertown.</P>
<P>The number enlisted since my last are two thousand four hun∣dred and fifty men, * * * * Our situation is truly alarming: and of this general Howe is well apprised, it being the common topic of conversation when the people left Boston last friday.—No doubt, when he is reinforced, he will avail himself of the information.</P>
<P>I am making the best disposition I can for our defence, hav∣ing thrown up, besides the work on Coble-hill, several redoubts, half-moons, &amp;c. along the bay: and I fear I shall be under the necessity of calling in the militia and minute-men of the coun∣try to my assistance: I say, I fear it,—because, by what I can learn from the officers in the army, belonging to this colony, it will be next to an impossibility to keep them under any degree of discipline, and that it will be very difficult to prevail on them to remain a moment longer than they chuse themselves. It is a mortifying reflection, to be reduced to this dilemna. There has been nothing wanting on my part, to infuse a proper spirit amongst the officers, that they may exert their influence with the soldiery. You see, by a fortnight's recruiting amongst men with arms in their hands, how little has been the success.</P>
<P>As the small-pox is now in Boston, I have used the precau∣tion of prohibiting such as lately came out, from coming near our camp.—General Burgoyne, I am informed, will soon em∣bark for England.—I think the risk too great to write you by post, whilst it continues to pass through New-York. It is cer∣tain that a post has been intercepted the beginning of last month, as they sent out several letters from Boston, with the post-mark of Baltimore on them. This goes by captain Joseph Blewer, who promises to deliver it carefully unto you.</P>
<P>You, doubtless, will have heard, before this reaches, of gene∣ral Montgomery's having got possession of Montreal. I congratu∣late
<PB N="48" REF="031423_0047_0FEC4A98574B8BF8"/>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor of writing to you, the thirtieth ultimo, inclosing an inventory of the military stores taken on board the brig Nancy by captain Manly of the armed schooner Lee. I have now to inform you that he has since sent into Beverly, a ship named the Concord, James Lowrie, master, from Greenock in Scotland, bound to Boston. She has on board dry goods and coals, to the value of three thousand six hundred and six pounds, nine shillings and seven pence, sterling, shipped by Craw∣ford, Anderson and Co. and consigned to James Anderson, merchant in Boston. It is mentioned in the letters found on board, that this cargo was for the use of the army; but, on a strict examination, I find it is really the property of the shippers and the person to whom consigned.—Pray what is to
<PB N="49" REF="031423_0048_0FEC4A9A40E91BC8"/>
be done with this ship and cargo? and what with the brigantine which brought the military stores?—It was agreed, in the con∣ference last October, "<HI>that all vessels employed merely as trans∣ports, and unarmed, with their crews, be set at liberty, upon giving security to return to Europe; but that this indulgence be not extended longer than till the first of April next.</HI>" In the shippers' letter, they mention: "you must procure a certificate from the general and admiral, of the Concord being in the go∣vernment service, such as the Glasgow packet brought with her, which was of great service, procured a liberty to arm her, which was refused us; also gave her a preference for some recruits that went out in her." In another part of the letter, they say:—"Captain Lowrie will deliver you the contract for the coals: we gave it to him, as it perhaps might be of use, as a certificate of his ship being employed in the government service." Every letter on board breathes nothing but enmity to this country: and a vast number of them there are.</P>
<P>It is some time since I recommended to the Congress that they would institute a court for the trial of prizes made by the conti∣nental armed vessels: which I hope they have ere now taken into their consideration: otherwise I should again take the liberty of urging it in the most pressing manner.</P>
<P>The conduct of a great number of the Connecticut troops has laid me under the necessity of calling in a body of the mi∣litia much sooner than I apprehended there would be an occa∣sion for such a step. I was afraid some time ago that they would incline to go home when the time of their enlistment expired. I called upon the officers of the several regiments, to know whether they could prevail on the men to remain un∣til the first of January, or till a sufficient number of other for∣ces could be raised to supply their place. I suppose they were deceived themselves: I know they deceived me by assurances that I need be under no apprehensions on that score, for the men would not leave the lines. Last friday shewed how much they were mistaken, as the major part of the troops of that colony were going away with their arms and ammunition. We have however, by threats, persuasion, and the activity of the people of the country, who sent back many of them that had set out, prevailed upon the most part to stay. There are about eighty of them missing.</P>
<P>I have called in three thousand men from this province; and general Sullivan, who lately returned from the province of New-Hampshire, having informed me that a number of men were there ready, at the shortest notice, I have demanded two
<PB N="50" REF="031423_0049_0FEC4A9D43174668"/>
thousand from that province. These two bodies, I expect, will be in by the tenth instant, to make up the deficiency of the Connecticut-men, whom I have promised to dismiss on that day, as well as the numbers to whom I was obliged to grant furloughs before any would enlist.—As the same defection is much to be apprehended when the time of the Massachu∣setts-Bay, New-Hampshire, and Rhode-Island forces is ex∣pired, I beg the attention of Congress to this important affair.</P>
<P>I am informed that it has been the custom of these provinces in the last war, for the legislative power to order every town to provide a certain quota of men for the campaign. This or some other mode should be at present adopted, as I am satisfied the men cannot be had without. This the Congress will please to take into their immediate consideration. My suspicions on this head I shall also communicate to the governors Trumbull and Cooke, also to the New-Hampshire convention.</P>
<P>The number enlisted in the last week are about thirteen hundred men. By this you see how slow this important work goes on. * * *</P>
<P>An express is just come in from general Schuyler, with let∣ters from colonel Arnold and general Montgomery, copies of which I have the honor to inclose you. Upon the whole, I think affairs carry a pleasing aspect in that quarter. The reduction of Quebec is an object of such great importance, that I doubt not the Congress will give every assistance in their power for the accom∣plishing it this winter.</P>
<P>By the last accounts from the armed schooners sent to the ri∣ver St. Lawrence, I fear we have but little to expect from them: they were falling short of provision, and mention that they would be obliged to return; which at this time will be parti∣cularly unfortunate, as if they chose a proper station, all the vessels coming down that river must fall into their hands. The plague, trouble, and vexation I have had with the crews of all the armed vessels, is inexpressible. I do believe there is not on earth a more disorderly set,—every time they come into port, we hear of nothing but mutinous complaints. Manly's success has lately, and but lately, quieted his people. The crews of the Washington and Harrison have actually deserted them; so that I have been under the necessity of ordering the agent to lay the latter up, and get hands for the other on the best terms he could.</P>
<P>The house of representatives and the honorable board have sent me a vote of theirs relative to the harbor of Cape-Cod,
<PB N="51" REF="031423_0050_0FEC4AA3AC3AB930"/>
which you have herewith. I shall send an officer thither to examine what can be done for its defence, though I do not think I shall be able to give them such assistance as may be re∣quisite; for I have at present neither men, powder, nor cannon to spare. The great want of powder is what the attention of Congress should be particularly applied to. I dare not attempt any thing offensive, let the temptation or advantage be ever so great, as I have not more of that most essential article, than will be absolutely necessary to defend our lines, should the enemy attempt to attack them.</P>
<P>By recent information from Boston, general Howe is going to send out a number of the inhabitants, in order, it is thought, to make more room for his expected reinforcements. There i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one part of the information I can hardly give credit to:—a sai∣lor says that a number of those coming out have been innoculat∣ed, with design of spreading the small-pox through this country and camp. I have communicated this to the general court; and recommended their attention thereto.</P>
<P>They are arming one of the transports in Boston, with which they mean to decoy some of our armed vessels. As we are apprised of their design, I hope they will be disappointed.</P>

They are returned, and brought with them three of the principal inhabitants from the Island of St. Johns'. * * * They brought the governor's commission, the province seal, &amp;c. &amp;c. As the captains acted without any warrant for such conduct, I have thought it but justice to discharge these gentlemen, whose families were left in the utmost distress.</P>
<P>I am credibly informed that James Anderson, the consignee and part owner of the ship Concord and cargo, is not only unfriendly to American liberty, but actually in arms against us,—being captain of the Scotch company at Boston. Whether
<PB N="52" REF="031423_0051_0FEC4AAAF43D8CE8"/>
your being acquainted with this circumstance, or not, will ope∣rate against the vessel and cargo, I will not take upon me to say: but there are many articles on board, so absolutely necessary for the army, that, whether she is made a prize or not, we must have them.</P>

<P>* * * The numbers enlisted last week are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> men. If they go on at this slow rate, it will be a long time before this army is complete. I have wrote to the governors of Connecti∣cut and Rhode-Island, also to the Convention of New-Hamp∣shire, on this subject. A copy of my letter to them I have the honor to inclose herewith. A letter to the same purport I sent to the legislature of this province.</P>
<P>The militia are coming in fast. I am much pleased with the alacrity which the good people of this province, as well as those of New-Hampshire, have shewn upon this occasion. I ex∣pect the whole will be in this day and to-morrow, when what remains of the Connecticut [<HI>troops</HI>], who have not enlisted, will have liberty to go to their fire-sides.</P>
<P>The commissary-general is still, by his indisposition, detained from Camp. He committed an error when making-out the ra∣tion-list: for he was then serving out (and has continued so to do) six ounces per man, per week, of butter, though it is not in∣cluded in the list approved of by Congress. I do not think it would be expedient to put a stop thereto; as every thing, that would have a tendency to give the soldiery room for complaint, must be avoided.</P>
<P>The information I received that the enemy intending spreading the small-pox amongst us, I could not suppose them capable of.—I now must give some credit to it, as it has made its appearance on several of those who last came out of Boston.—Every necessary precaution has been taken to prevent its being communicated to this army; and the general court will take care that it does not spread through the country.</P>
<P>I have not heard that any more troops are arrived at Boston; which is a lucky circumstance, as the Connecticut troops, I now find, are for the most part gone off.—The houses in Boston are lessening every day: They are pulled down, either for fire-wood, or to prevent the effects of fire, should we attempt a bombard∣ment or an attack upon the town.—Coble-hill is strongly for∣tified,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your favor of the second instant, with the several resolves of Congress therein inclosed.—The resolves re∣lative to captures made by continental armed vessels only want a court established for trial, to make them complete. This, I hope, will be soon done, as I have taken the liberty to urge it often to the Congress.</P>
<P>I am somewhat at a loss to know whether I am to raise the two battalions of marines here, or not. As the delay can be attended with but little inconvenience, I will wait a further explanation from Congress, before I take any steps therein.</P>
<P>I am much pleased that the money will be forwarded with all possible expedition, as it is much wanting; also that Conolly and his associates are taken. It has been a very fortunate discovery. I make no doubt but that the Congress will take every necessary measure to dispossess lord Dunmore of his hold in Virginia; the sooner steps are taken for that purpose, the more probability there will be of their being effectual. * * * *</P>
<P>I will make application to general Howe, and propose an ex∣change for Mr. Ethan Allen. I am much afraid I shall have a like proposal to make for captain Martindale of the armed brig∣antine Washington, and his men, who, it is reported, was taken a few days past by a man-of-war, and carried into Boston.—We cannot expect to be always successful.</P>
<P>You will doubtless hear of the barbarity of captain Wallace on Conanicut island, ere this reaches your hands.</P>
<P>About a hundred and fifty more of the poor inhabitants are come out of Boston. The small-pox rages all over the town: such of the militia as had it not before, are now under innoculati∣on. This, I apprehend, is a weapon of defence they are using against us. What confirms me in this opinion, is, that I have in∣formation that they are tearing up the pavement, to be provided against a bombardment.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CAPTAIN Manly, of the Lee armed schooner, took an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent into Beverly the sloop Betsey, A. Atkinson master. She is an armed vessel, dispatched by lord Dunmore, with Indian corn, potatoes, and oats, for the army in Boston. The packets of letters found on board, I have the honor to send you with this by captain James Chambers, they being of so much im∣portance, that I do not think it would be prudent to trust them by a common express.</P>
<P>As lord Dunmore's schemes are fully laid open in these let∣ters, I need not point out to the Congress the necessity there is of a vigorous exertion being adopted by them, to dispossess his lordship of the strong hold he has got in Virginia.—I do not mean to dictate; but I am sure they will pardon me for giving them freely my opinion, which is that the fate of America a good deal depends on his being obliged to evacuate Norfolk this winter, or not.</P>
<P>I have Kirkland well secured, and think I will send him to you for examination. By most of the letters relative to him, he is a dangerous fellow. John Stewart's letters and papers are of a very interesting nature. Governor Tonyn's and many other letters from Augustine shewing the weakness of the place; at the same time, of what vast consequence it would be for us to possess ourselves of it, and the great quantity of ammunition contained in the forts.—Indeed these papers are of so great conse∣quence, that I think this but little inferior to any prize our famous Manly has taken.</P>
<P>We now work at our ease on Leechmore's hill. On disco∣vering our party there yesterday morning, the ship which lay opposite began a cannonade, to which Mount Horam added some shells.—One of our men was wounded.—We fired a few shot from two eighteen-pounders which are placed on Coble-hill, and soon obliged the ship to shift her station. She now lies in the ferry-way: and, except a few shells from the mount in Boston (which do no execution), we have no interruption in prosecuting our works, which will in a very short time be com∣pleted. When this is done,—when we have powder to sport with,—I think, if the Congress resolve on the execution of the pro∣posal made relative to the town of Boston, it can be done.</P>
<P>I have sent a letter in this day to general Howe, of which a copy goes herewith. My reason for pointing out brigadier-ge∣neral Prescot as the object who is to suffer Mr. Allen's fate, is, that, by letters from general Schuyler, and copies of letters
<PB N="56" REF="031423_0055_0FEC4ABA40EE0D68"/>
from general Montgomery to Schuyler, I am given to under∣stand that Prescot is the cause of Allen's sufferings.—I thought it best to be decisive on the occasion, as did the generals whom I con∣sulted thereon.</P>
<P>The returns of men enlisted since my last, amount to about eighteen hundred, making in the whole seven thousand one hundred and forty. The militia that are come in, both from this province and New-Hampshire, are very fine-looking men, and go through their duty with great alacrity. The dispatch made, both by the people in marching and by the legislative powers in complying with my requisition, has given me infinite sa∣tisfaction.</P>
<P>Your letter of the eighth instant, with the explanatory re∣solve respecting my calling forth the militia and minute-men, is come to hand; to which I shall pay all due attention. You have removed all the difficulties which I labored under, about the two battalions of marines. I shall obey the orders of Con∣gress in looking out for proper officers to command that corps. I make no doubt but, when the money arrives to pay off the arrears and the month's advance, that it will be a great encourage∣ment for the men to enlist.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a letter I lately received from Mr. James Lovell.</P>
<P>His case is truly pitiable. I wish some mode could be fallen upon to relieve him from the cruel situation he is now in.—I am sensible of the impropriety of exchanging a soldier for a ci∣tizen: but there is something so cruelly distressing in regard to this gentleman, that I dare say you will take it under your consi∣deration.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor to address myself to you on the nine∣teenth instant, since which I have received undoubted infor∣mation that the genuine instructions given to Conolly have not reached your hands; that they are very artfully concealed in the tree of his saddle, and covered with canvas so nicely that they are scarcely discernable; that those which were found up∣on him were intended to deceive, if he were caught.—You will most certainly have his saddle taken to pieces, in order to discover this deep-laid plot.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a copy of general Howe's letter in answer to the one I wrote him the eighteenth instant. The conduct I am to
<PB N="57" REF="031423_0056_0FEC4ABCC9B6CD18"/>
observe towards brigadier Prescot in consequence of these letters, the Congress will oblige me by determining for me.</P>
<P>The gentlemen by whom you sent the money are arrived.—The sum they brought, though large, is not sufficient to answer the demands of the army, which at this time are remarkably heavy: there is three month's pay due, one month's advance, two dollars for each blanket—the arms, that are left by those who are dismissed, to be paid for,—besides the demands which are on the commissary and quarter-master-generals. You will therefore see the necessity of another remittance, which I beg may be as soon as you conveniently can.</P>
<P>I will take the opportunity of the return of these gentlemen, to send colonel Kirkland to you for examination, and that you may dispose of him as to you may seem proper.</P>
<P>A committee from the general court of this province called on me the other day, informing me that they were in great want of ordnance for the defence of the colony; that, if what belonged to them, now in use here, was kept for the continent, they would be under the necessity of providing themselves with o∣thers; of course what is kept must be paid for. There are ma∣ny of the cannon of very little use; such of them as are good, I cannot at present part with: perhaps when I receive the sup∣ply from New-York and Canada, it may be in my power to spare them.</P>
<P>Mr. Wadsworth has sent in his report respecting Cape-Cod har∣bor, a copy of which you will receive herewith; also a letter from Mr. Jacob Bailey, put into my hands by colonel Little.—It contains some things that may not be unworthy the considera∣tion of Congress.</P>
<P>We have made good progress in the works of Leechmore's point. They would have been finished ere this, but for the seve∣rity of the weather, which prevents our people from working.</P>
<P>I received a letter from governor Cooke, which expresses the fears of the people of Rhode-Island, lest the ships, which we had information were sailed with some troops on board, were destined for Newport. I sent major-general Lee there, to point out to them such defence as he may think the place capable of. I sincerely wish he may be able to do it with effect, as that place, in its present state, is an asylum for such as are disaffected to American liberty.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE to you the twenty-fifth instant; since which I am not honored with any of your favors. The estimate I then inclosed you was calculated to pay the troops, &amp;c. up to the first of January. That cannot be done for want of funds in the paymaster-general's hands; which causes a great murmur∣ing amongst those who are going off.—The monthly expences of this army amount to near two hundred and seventy-five thou∣sand dollars, which I take the liberty of recommending to the observation of Congress, that their future remittances may be governed thereby.</P>
<P>It sometimes happens that persons would wish to deposit mo∣ney in the hands of the paymaster-general, for his bills on the treasury at Philadelphia. He has hitherto declined such offers, not having authority from Congress to draw.—Would it not be proper to give this power?—If it should be approved of, you will please to point out the mode that the Congress would chuse to have it done in.</P>
<P>The cloathing sent to the quarter-master-general is not suffici∣ent to put half our army into regimentals; nor is there a possi∣bility of getting any quantity here. I have wrote to general Schuyler, that I wish what was lodged at Albany could be spared for these troops, as General Montgomery would clothe the men under his command at Montreal. If this can be done, it will be of infinite service; and no time should be lost in forwarding them to this camp.</P>
<P>In forming the regiments for the new establishment, I thought it but justice to appoint the officers, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ached under colonel Arnold, to commissions in them. Their absence at present is of very great detriment to the service, especially in recruiting: I would therefore wish, if the Congress intend raising troops in or for Canada, that they could be taken in there. The sooner I have their opinion of this matter, the better, that, if they can be commissioned in Canada, I may appoint officers here to re∣place them.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have a copy of representation sent to me by the legislative body of this province, respecting four companies sta∣tioned at Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham. As they were never regimented, and were doing duty at a distance from the rest of the army, I did not know whether to consider them as a part of it; nor do I think myself authorised to direct payment for them without the approbation of Congress.</P>
<P>It has been represented to me that the free negroes who have
<PB N="59" REF="031423_0058_0FEC4AC155493800"/>
served in this army are very much dissatisfied at being discard∣ed. As it is to be apprehended they may seek employ in the ministerial army, I have presumed to depart from the resolution respecting them, and have given licence for their being enlisted. If this is disapproved of by Congress, I will put a stop to it.</P>
<P>* * * I must remark that the pay of the assistant engi∣neers is so very small, that we cannot expect men of science will engage in it. Those gentlemen, who are in that station, re∣mained under the expectation that an additional allowance would be made them by the respective provinces in which they were ap∣pointed, to that allowed by the Congress.</P>
<P>Captain Freeman arrived this day at camp from Canada. He left Quebec the twenty-fourth ultimo, in consequence of general Carleton's proclamation, which I have the honor to send you here∣with. He saw colonel Arnold the twenty-sixth, and says that he was joined at Point-á-tremble, by general Montgomery, the first instant;—that they were about two thousand strong, and were making every preparation for attacking Quebec;—that general Carleton had with him about twelve hundred men, the majority of whom are sailors;—that it was his opinion the French would give up the place if they get the same conditions granted to the inhabitants of Montreal. * * *</P>
<P>Captains Semple and Harbeson take under their care, Mr. Kirkland. * * * Captain Mathews and Mr. Robinson will ac∣company them. The two latter were taken prisoners by lord Dunmore, who was sending them to Boston, from whence there is little doubt but they would be forwarded to England, to which place I am credibly informed captain Martindale and the crew of the Washington are sent; also colonel Allen, and the prisoners taken with him in Canada. This may account for general Howe's silence on the subject of an exchange of prisoners mentioned in my letter to him.</P>
<P>General Lee is just returned from his excursion to Rhode-Island;—he has pointed out the best method the island would ad∣mit of for its defence; he has endeavored all in his power to make friends of those who were our enemies. You have, inclosed, a specimen of his abilities in that way, for your perusal. I am of opinion, that, if the same plan was pursued through every pro∣vince, it would have a very good effect.</P>
<P>I have long had it on my mind to mention to Congress that frequent applications had been made to me respecting the chap∣lain's pay, which is too small to encourage men of abilities. Some of them, who have left their flocks, are obliged to pay the parson acting for them, more than they receive. I need not
<PB N="60" REF="031423_0059_0FEC4AD05C6F9638"/>
point out the great utility of gentlemen whose lives and conver∣sation are unexceptionable, being employed for that service, in this army. There are two ways of making it worth the attention of such: one is an advancement of their pay; the other that one chaplain be appointed to two regiments. This last, I think, may be done without inconvenience. I beg leave to recommend this matter to Congress, whose sentiments hereon I shall impati∣ently expect.</P>
<P>Upon a farther conversation with captain Freeman, he is of opinion that general Montgomery has with him near three thou∣sand men, including colonel Arnold's. He says that lord Pitt had received repeated orders from his father to return home; in consequence of which, he had embarked some time in October, with a captain Green who was master of a vessel belonging to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>By a number of salutes in Boston harbor yesterday, I fancy admiral Shuldham is arrived. Two large ships were seen com∣ing in.</P>
<P>Our enlistments now amount to nine thousand six hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>Those gentlemen, who were made prisoners by lord Dun∣more being left destitute of money and necessaries, I have ad∣vanced them a hundred pounds lawful money belonging to the public, for which I have taken captain Mathews's draught on the treasury of Virginia, which goes inclosed.</P>

<P>The resolution relative to the troops in Boston, I beg the favor of you, sir, to assure the Congress shall be attempted to be put in execution the first moment I see a probability of suc∣cess, and in such a way as a council of officers shall think most likely to produce it: but if this should not happen as soon as you may expect or my wishes prompt to, I request that Con∣gress may be pleased to advert to my situation, and do me the justice to believe, that circumstance, and not want of inclina∣tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the cause of delay.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="031423_0060_0FEC4AD566785BB0"/>
It is not in the pages of history, perhaps, to furnish a case like ours;—to maintain a post within musket-shot of the enemy, for six months together, without<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Left blank in the original to guard against the danger of mis∣carriage.—Read,</HI> "without powder."</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and at the same time to disband one army, and recruit another, within that distance of twenty odd British regiments,—is. more, probably, than ever was attempted. But if we succeed as well in the last, as we have heretofore in the first, I shall think it the most fortunate event of my whole life.</P>
<P>By a very intelligent gentleman, a Mr. Hutchinson, from Boston, I learn, that it was admiral Shuldham that came into the harbor on saturday last;—that two of the five regiments from Cork are arrived at Halifax;—two others have sailed for Quebec; but what was become of them, could not be told:—and the other (the fifty-fifth) has just got into Boston. Certain it is also, that the greater part of the seventeenth regiment is arrived there, Whether we are to conclude from hence that more than five regiments have been sent out, or that the companies of the seventeenth, arrived at Boston, are part of the regiments destined for Hallifax and Quebec, I know not.</P>
<P>We also learn from this gentleman and others, that the troops, embarked for Halifax (as mentioned in my letter of the sixteenth) were really designed for that place, but recalled from Nantasket road, upon advice being received of the above regiments there. I am also informed of a fleet now getting ready under the convoy of the Scarborough and Fowey men-of-war,—consisting of five transports and two bomb vessels, with about three hundred marines, and several flat bottomed boats. It is whispered that they are designed for Newport, but gene∣rally thought in Boston, that it is meant for Long-Island: and it is probable it will be followed by more troops, as the other transports are taking in water,—to lie, as others say, in Nan∣tasket road, to be out of the ice. A large quantity of biscuit is also baking.</P>
<P>As the real design cannot with certainty be known, I submit it, with all due deference, to the superior judgment of Congress, whether it would not be confident with prudence, to have some of the Jersey troops thrown into New-York, to prevent an evil, which would be almost irremediable, should it happen,—I mean, the landing of troops at that place, or upon Long-Island, near it.</P>

<P>EVERY account I have out of Boston, confirms the em∣barkation of troops mentioned in my last, which, from the sea∣son of the year, and other circumstances, must be destined for some expedition to the southward of this. I have therefore thought it prudent to send major-general Lee to New-York. I have given him letters recommendatory to governor Trumbull, and to the committee of safety at New-York. I have good hopes that in Connecticut he will get many volunteers, who (I have some reason to think) will accompany him on this expedi∣tion, without more expense to the continent than their mainte∣nance. But should it be otherwise, and that they should ex∣pect pay, I think it is a trifling consideration, when put in com∣petition with the importance of the object, which is to put the city of New-York, with such parts of the North river and Long-Island as to him shall seem proper, in that state of de∣fence, which the season of the year and circumstances will ad∣mit of,—so as, if possible, to prevent the enemy from forming a lodgment in that government, which, I am afraid, contains too many persons disaffected to the cause of liberty and Ame∣rica. I have also wrote to lord Stirling to give him all the as∣sistance that he can with the troops under his command, in the continental service, provided it does not interfere with any or∣ders he may receive from Congress relative to them.</P>
<P>I hope the Congress will approve of my conduct in sending general Lee on this expedition:—I am sure I mean it well; as experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an ene∣my from posting themselves, than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession.</P>
<P>The evening of the eighth instant, a party of our men, under the command of major Knoulton, were ordered to go and burn
<PB N="63" REF="031423_0062_0FEC4ADDACCF67B0"/>
some houses which lay at the foot of Bunker's-hill, and at the head of Charleston. They were also ordered to bring off the guard, which, we expected, consisted, of an officer and thirty men. They crossed the mill-dam about half after eight o'clock, and gallantly executed their business,—having burned eight houses, and brought with them a serjeant and four privates of the tenth regiment. There was but one man more there, who making some resistance, they were obliged to dispatch. The gun that killed him was the only one discharged by our men, though several hundred were fired by the enemy from within their works, but in so confused a manner, that not one of our people was hurt.</P>

Upon the dissolu∣tion of the old army, I was apprehensive that the new would be deficient in this instance: and, that the want might be as in∣considerable as possible, I gave it out in orders, that the arms of such men as did not re-enlist (or such of them as were good) should be retained at the prices which should be affixed by per∣sons appointed to inspect and value them: and, that we might be sure of them, I added that there would be a stoppage of pay for the months of November and December, from those who should carry their firelocks away without their being first exa∣mined. I hoped, by these precautions, to have procured a con∣siderable number: but, sir, I find with much concern, that from the badness of the arms, and the disobedience of too many in bearing them off without a previous inspection—very few were collected. Neither are we to expect that many will be brought in by the new recruits, the officers, who are out enlisting, hav∣ing reported that few men who have arms will enlist in the ser∣vice; and that they are under the disagreeable alternative of taking men without arms, or of getting none. Unhappy situa∣tion, and much to be deplored!—especially when we have every reason to convince us, that we have to contend with a formidable army, well provided of every necessary; and that there will be a most vigorous exertion of ministerial vengeance against us, as soon as they think themselves in a condition for
<PB N="64" REF="031423_0063_0FEC4ADF92AEF580"/>
it. I hope it is in the power of Congress to afford us relief:—if it is not, what must, what can be done?</P>
<P>Our treasury is almost exhausted, and the demands against it very considerable. A constant supply of money, to answer every claim and exigency, would much promote the good of the ser∣vice. In the common affairs of life, it is useful: in war, it is absolutely necessary and essential. I would beg leave, too, to remind you of the tents, and their importance;—hoping that if an opportunity has offered, you have procured them. I fear that our army will not be raised to the new establishment in any reasonable time, if ever: the enlisting goes on so very slow, that it almost seems at an end.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fourth instant, I wrote you that I had re∣ceived certain intelligence from a Mr. Hutchinson and others, that two of the five regiments from Cork were arrived at Hali∣fax, one at Boston, and the two others had sailed for Quebec, and had not been heard of. I am now assured (as a matter to be relied on) by four captains of ships, who left England about the second of November, and who appear to be men of vera∣city, that the whole of these regiments (except the two com∣panies that arrived at Boston some time ago), when they sailed, were at Milford Haven, where they had been obliged to put in, by a violent storm, the nineteenth of October; that they would not be able to leave it for a considerable time, as they were under the necessity of repairing their vessels, and getting some new ones taken up.—Such is the uncertainty and contradicti∣on in what I now hear, that it is not possible to know what to believe or disbelieve-</P>
<P>I wrote to the general court yesterday, and to the convention of New-Hampshire, immediately upon seeing the great deficiency in our arms,—praying that they would interest themselves in the matter, and furnish me with all in their power. Whether I shall get any, or what quantity, I cannot determine, not having re∣ceived their answers.—The same application will be made to the governments of Connecticut and Rhode-Island.</P>
<P>I do myself the honor to send you sundry newspapers I re∣ceived from the above-mentioned captains, as they may be later than any you have seen, and contain some interesting intelli∣gence.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TAKING it for granted that general Schuyler has not only informed you of the fall of the brave and much-to-be-la∣mented general Montgomery, but of the situation of our affair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Canada (as related by general Wooster, colonel Arnold, co∣lonel Campbell, and others), I shall not take up much more of your time on this subject, than is necessary to inclose you a copy of his letter to me, with the result thereon, as appears by the council of war, which I immediately summoned on the occasion, and at which Mr. Adams, by my particular desire, was good enough to attend.</P>
<P>It may appear strange, sir, as I had not men to spar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from these lines, that I should presume (without first sending to Con∣gress, and obtaining an express direction) to recommend to the governments of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New-Hamp∣shire, to raise each a regiment, on the continental account, for this service. I wish most ardently that the urgency of the case would have admitted of the delay. I wish also that the purport of general Schuyler's letter had not, unavoidably as it were, laid me under an indispensable obligation to do it:—for having informed you in his letter (a copy of which he inclosed me) of his dependence on this quarter, for men, I thought you might also have some reliance on my exertions. This consideration, added to my fears of the fatal consequences of delay,—to an information of your having designed three thousand men for Ca∣nada,—to a belief, founded chiefly on general Schuyler's letters, that few or none of them were raised,—and to my apprehensi∣ons for New-York, which led me to think that no troops could be spared from that quarter,—induced me to lose not a mo∣ment's time in throwing in a force there; being well assured that general Carleton will improve, to the utmost, the advanta∣ges gained, leaving no artifices untried, to fix the Canadians and Indians (who, I find, are too well disposed to take part with the strongest) in his interest.</P>
<P>If these reasons are not sufficient to justify my conduct in the opinion of Congress,—if the measure contravenes any resolution of theirs,—they will please to countermand the levying and marching of the regiments as soon as possible, and do me the justice to believe that my intentions were good, if my judgment has erred.</P>
<P>The Congress will please to observe, that the measures of supporting our posts in Canada appeared of such exceeding great importance, that the general officers (agreeing with me in sen∣timent,
<PB N="66" REF="031423_0065_0FEC4AE713204D20"/>
and unwilling to lay any burden which can possibly be avoided,—although it may turn out an ill-timed piece of parsi∣mony) have resolved that the three regiments of Canada shall be part of the thirteen militia regiments which were requested to reinforce this army,—as appears by the minutes of another council of war, held on the sixteenth instant. I shall (being much hurried and fatigued) add no more in this letter, than my duty to Congress, and that I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>P. S. I inclose you a copy of my letter to the governments of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New-Hampshire; also a copy of a resolution of this colony, in answer to an application of mine for arms.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I have been informed by a message from the general court of Massachusetts, that they have resol∣ved upon the raising of a regiment for Canada, and appointed the field officers for it, in the western parts of this government. I am also informed by express from Governor Trumbull, that he and his council of safety had agreed upon the raising of a regiment for the same purpose; which was anticipating my appli∣cation to that government.</P>
<P>If commissions (and they are applied for) are to be given by Congress to the three regiments going to Canada, you will please to have them forwarded, as I have none by me for that purpose.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE commissary general being at length [<HI>recovered</HI>] from a long and painful illness, I have it in my power to comply with the requisition of Congress, in forwarding an estimate of the expense attending his office, as also that of the quarter-master-general.</P>
<P>You will please to observe that the commissary, by his ac∣count of the matter, has entered into no special agreement with any of the persons he has found occasion to employ (as those, to whose names sums are annexed, are of their own fixing), but left it to Congress to ascertain their wages. I shall say nothing therefore on this head, farther than relates to the proposition of Mr. * * *, to be allowed one-eighth for his trouble and the delivery of the other seven-eighths of provisions, which to me appears exorbitant in the extreme, however conformable it may be to custom and usage: I therefore think that reasonable
<PB N="67" REF="031423_0066_0FEC4AF3572041F0"/>
stipends had better be fixed upon. Both the quarter-master and commissary-generals assure me that they do not employ a single person uselessly: and as I have too good an opinion of them to think they would deceive me, I believe them.</P>
<P>I shall take the liberty, in this place, of recommending the expediency, indeed the absolute necessity, of appointing fit and proper persons to settle the accounts of this army. To do it with precision, requires time, care, and attention: the longer it is left undone, the more intricate they will be, the more lia∣ble to error, and difficult to explain and rectify;—as also the persons in whose hands they are (if disposed to take undue ad∣vantage) will be less subject to detection. I have been as at∣tentive as the nature of my office would admit of, in granting warrants for money on the paymaster: but it would be abso∣lutely impossible for me to go into an examination of all the ac∣counts incident to this army, and the vouchers appertaining to them, without devoting so large a portion of my time to the business, as might not only prove injurious, but fatal to it in other respects. This ought, in my humble opinion, to be the particular business of a select committee of Congress, or one appointed by them, who, once in three months at furthest, should make a settlement with the officers in the different de∣partments.</P>
<P>Having met with no encouragement from the governments of Massachusetts and New-Hampshire, from my application for arms and expecting no better from Connecticut and Rhode-Is∣land, I have as the last expedient, sent one or two officers from each regiment into the country, with money to try if they can buy. In what manner they succeed, Congress shall be informed as soon as they return.</P>
<P>Congress, in my last, would discover my motives for streng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ening these lines with the militia: but whether,—as the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ther turns out exceedingly mild, insomuch as to promise no∣thing favorable from ice,—and no appearance of powder,—I shall be able to attempt any thing decisive, time only can deter∣mine. No man upon earth wishes more ardently to destroy the nest in Boston, than I do:—no person would be willing to go greater lengths than I shall, to accomplish it, if it shall be thought adviseable. But if we have neither powder to bombard with, nor ice to pass on, we shall be in no better situation than we have been in all the year:—we shall be worse, because their works are stronger.</P>
<P>I have accounts from Boston, which I think may be relied on, that general Clinton, with about four or five hundred men,
<PB N="68" REF="031423_0067_0FEC4AF70E22FCF0"/>
hath left that place within these four days. Whether this is part of the detachment which was making up (as mentioned in my letter of the fourth instant, and then at Nantasket) or not, is not in my power to say. If it is designed for New-York or Long-Island as some think, throwing a body of troops there may prove a fortunate circumstance. If they go farther south agreeable to the conjectures of others, I hope there will be men to receive them.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the positive assertions of the four captains from Portsmouth, noticed in my letter of the fourteenth, I am now convinced from several corroborating circumstances,—the accounts of deserters, and of a lieutenant Hill, of Lord Percy's regiment, who left Ireland the fifth of November, and was ta∣ken by a privateer from Newburyport,—that the seventeenth and fifty-fifth regiments are arrived at Boston, and other troops at Halifax, agreeable to the information of Hutchinson and o∣thers. Lieutenant Hill says that the transports of two regiments only were forced into Milford Haven.</P>
<P>Congress will think me a little remiss, I fear, when I inform them that I have done nothing yet towards raising the battallions of marines: but I hope to stand exculpated from blame, when they hear the reason, which was, that already having twenty-six incomplete regiments, I thought it would be adding to an ex∣pence, already-great, in officers, to set two entire corps of offi∣cers on foot when perhaps we should not add ten men a week by it to our present numbers. In this opinion the general offi∣cers have concurred, which induced me to suspend the matter a little longer.—Our enlistments, for the two last weeks, have not amounted to a thousand men, and are diminishing. The regiment for Canada (it is thought) will soon be filled, as the men are to chuse all but their field officers, who are appointed by the court.</P>
<P>On sunday evening, thirteen of the Caghnewaga Indians ar∣rived here on a visit. I shall take care that they be so enter∣tained during their stay, that they may return impressed with sentiments of friendship for us, and also of our great strength. One of them is colonel Louis, who honored me with a visit once before.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favours of the sixth and twentieth instant I received yesterday, with the several resolves of Congress alluded to: for which I return you my thanks.</P>
<P>Knowing the great importance Canada will be of to us in the present interesting contest, and the relief our friends there stand in need of, I should be happy, were it in my power to detach a bat∣talion from this camp: but it cannot be done. On the nine∣teenth instant, I had the honor to write to you, which will fully convey the resolutions of a council of war, and the sentiments of the general officers here, as to the propriety and expediency of sending troops from these lines, for the defence of which we have been and now are obliged to call in the militia;—to which I beg leave to refer you. You may rest assured that my endeavors and exertions shall not be wanting, to stimulate the governments of Connecticut and New-Hampshire to raise and forward reinforce∣ments as fast as possible; nor in any other instance that will pro∣mote the expedition.</P>
<P>I shall, in obedience to the order of Congress, though inter∣dicted by general Howe, propose an exchange of governor Skene for Mr. Lovell and family, and shall be happy to have an oppor∣tunity of putting this deserving man (who has distinguished his fidelity and regard to his country to be too great for persecution and cruelty to overcome) in any post agreeable to his wishes and in∣clination.</P>
<P>I do not know that there is any particular rank annexed to the office of aids-de-camp. Generally they are captains, and rank as such: but higher rank is often given on account of particular me∣rit and particular circumstances.—Aids to the king have the rank of colonels.—Whether any distinction should be made between those of your commander-in-chief and the other generals, I really know not: I think there ought.</P>
<P>You may rely that Conolly had instructions concealed in his saddle. Mr. * * * who was one of lord Dunmore's family, and another gentleman who wishes his name not to be mentioned, saw them cased in tin, put in the tree, and covered over. He pro∣bably has exchanged his saddle, or withdrew the papers when it was mended, as you conjecture. Those that have been disco∣vered are sufficiently bad; but I doubt not of the others being worse, and containing more diabolical and extensive plans.—I hope he will be taken proper care of, and meet with rewards equal to his merits.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="031423_0069_0FEC4AFB8C534600"/>
I shall appoint officers in the places of those who are in Ca∣nada, as I am fully persuaded they will wish to continue there, for making our conquest complete in that quarter.—I wish their bravery and valor may be attended with the smiles of for∣tune.</P>
<P>It gives me great pleasure to hear of the measures Congress are taking for manufacturing powder. I hope their endeavors will be crowned with success. I too well know and regret the want of it. It is scarcely possible to describe the disadvantages an army must labor under, when not provided with a sufficient supply of this necessary. It may seem strange, that, after hav∣ing received about eleven tons, added to about five tons which I found here, and no general action has happened, we should be so deficient in this article and require more. But you will please to consider, that, besides its being in its nature subject to waste, and (whilst the men lay in bad tents) unavoidably da∣maged by severe and heavy rains (which could not have been prevented, unless it had been entirely withdrawn from the men, and an attack hazarded against us without ammunition in their hands)—the armed vessels, our own occasional firings, and some small supplies I have been obliged to afford the seaport towns threatened with destruction,—to which may be added the supply to the militia, and going off of the old troops,—have occa∣sioned, and ever will, a large consumption of it, and waste, in spite of all the care in the world. The king's troops never have less than sixty rounds a man in their possession, independent of their stores.—To supply an army of twenty thousand men in this manner, would take near four hundred barrels, allowing noth∣ing for stores, artillery, &amp;c. I have been always afraid to place more than twelve or fifteen rounds at a time in the hands of our men, lest, any accident happening to it, we should be lest desti∣tute, and be undone.—I have been thus particular, not only to shew our poverty, but to exculpate myself from even a suspicion of unnecessary waste.</P>
<P>I shall inform the paymaster-general of the resolution of Con∣gress respecting his draughts, and the mode and account of them.</P>
<P>The companies at Chelsea and Malden are and have always been regimented.—It is not my intention to replace with continental troops the independent companies at Hingham, Weymouth, and Braintree. These places are exposed, but not more than Cape Ann, Beverly, Salem, Marblehead, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="031423_0070_0FEC4B01C10FBA80"/>
Is it the intention of Congress that the officers of the army should pay postage?—They are not exempted by the resolve of the ninth instant.</P>
<P>The Congress will be pleased, I have no doubt, to recollect that the five hundred thousand dollars, now coming, are but little more than enough to bring us up to the first day of this month; that to∣morrow will be the last of it: and, by their resolves, the troops are to be paid monthly.</P>
<P>I wish it was in my power to furnish Congress with such a general as they desire, to send to Canada. Since the unhappy reverse of our affairs in that quarter, general Schuyler has in∣formed me, that, though he had thoughts of declining the ser∣vice before, he would now act. My letter of the eleventh will inform them of general Lee's being at New-York. He will be ready to obey their orders, should they incline to send him:—but, if I am not greatly deceived, he or some other spirited able officer will be wanted there in the spring, if not sooner; as we have undoubted intelligence that general Clinton has sailed with some troops.—The reports of their number are various, from between four and five hundred to nineteen companies of grena∣diers and light infantry. It is also imagined that the regiments, which were to sail the first of December, are intended for that place or Virginia.—General Putnam is a most valuable man, and a fine executive officer: but I do not know how he would conduct in a separate department. He is a younger major-general than Mr. Schuyler, who, as I observed, having determined to continue in the service, will, I expect, repair into Canada.—A co∣py of my letter to him, on this and the other subjects, I inclose you, as it will explain my motives for not stopping the regiments from these governments.</P>
<P>When captain Cochran arrives, I will give him every assistance in my power, in obedience to the orders of Congress: but I fear it will be the means of laying up our own vessels, as these people will not bear the distinction. Should this be the conse∣quence, it will be highly prejudicial to us, as we sometimes pick up their provision-vessels, and may continue to distress them in this way.</P>
<P>Last week captain Manly took a ship and brig bound to Boston from Whitehaven, with coals chiefly, and some potatoes, for the army. I have for his great vigilance and industry, appointed him commodore of our little squadron; and he now hoists his flag on board the schooner Hancock.</P>
<P>I congratulate you upon the recovery of Smith, and am ex∣ceedingly glad to hear of the measures Congress are taking for
<PB N="72" REF="031423_0071_0FEC4B03F0B1F140"/>
the general defence of the continent. The clouds thicken fast:—where they will burst, I know not: but we should be armed at all points.</P>
<P>I have not succeeded in my applications to these govern∣ments for arms. They have returned for answer, that they can∣not furnish any.—Whether I shall be more lucky in the last re∣source left in this quarter, I cannot determine, having not received returns from the officers sent out to purchase of the peo∣ple. I greatly fear that but very few will be procured in this way, as they are exceedingly scarce, and but a small part of what there are, fit for service,—when they make their report you shall be in∣formed.</P>
<P>The quarter-master-general has just received from general Schuyler clothing for the soldiery, amounting to about seven∣teen hundred pounds York currency. It has come very season∣ably, as they are in great want, and will contribute a little to their relief.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I saw Mr. * * *, and mentioning that nothing had been found in the tree of Conolly's saddle, he told me there had been a mistake in the matter; that the instruc∣tions were artfully concealed on the two pieces of wood which are on the mail-pillion of his portmanteau-saddle; that, by order of lord Dunmore he saw them contrived for the purpose, the papers put in, and first covered with tin, and over that with a waxed canvas cloth.—He is so exceedingly pointed and clear in his information, that I have no doubt of its being true.—I could wish them to be discovered, as I think they contain some curious and extraordinary plans.</P>
<P>In my letter of the twenty-fourth instant, I mentioned the arrival of thirteen of our Caghnewaga friends. They honored me with a talk to-day, as did three of the tribes of the St. John's and Pasmiquoddi Indians;—copies of which I beg leave to inclose you. I shall write to general Schuyler respecting the tender of service made by the former, and not to call for their assistance, unless he shall at any time want it, or be under the necessity of doing it to prevent their taking the side of our ene∣mies.</P>
<P>I had the honor of writing to you on the nineteenth of No∣vember, and then I informed you of having engaged two per∣sons to go to Nova-Scotia on the business recommended in your letter of the tenth: and also that the state of the army would not then admit of a sufficient force being sent, for carrying into execution the views of Congress respecting the dock-yards, &amp;c.—I would now beg leave to mention, that if the persons,
<PB N="73" REF="031423_0072_0FEC4B05D73B9DD8"/>
sent for information, should report favorably of the expedi∣ency and practicability of the measure; it will not be in my power to detach any men from these lines: the situation of our affairs will not allow it.—I think it would be advisable to raise them in the eastern parts of this government. If it is attempt∣ed, it must be by people from the country.—A colonel * * * and a captain * * * have been with me: they think the men necessary may be easily engaged there, and the measure practi∣cable:—provided there are not more than two hundred British troops at Halifax, they are willing and ready to embark in the matter, upon the terms mentioned in their plan, which I in∣close you. I would wish you to advert to the considerations inducing them to the expedition, as I am not without appre∣hension, should it be undertaken upon their plan, that the in∣nocent and guilty will be involved in one common ruin.—I presume they do not expect to receive more than the five or ten thousand pounds mentioned in their scheme, and to be at every expence.—If we had men to spare, it might be undertaken for less than either, I conceive.—Perhaps, if Congress do not a∣dopt their proposition, they will undertaken to raise men for that particular purpose, who may be disbanded as soon as it is effected, and upon the same terms that are allowed the conti∣nental troops in general.—Whatever may be the determination of Congress upon the subject, you will please to communicate it to me immediately: for the season most favorable for the en∣terprise, is advancing fast; and we may expect in the spring that there will be more troops there, and the measure be more dif∣ficult to execute.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE purport of this letter will be directed to a single ob∣ject:—through you I mean to lay it before Congress; and—at the same time I beg their serious attention to the subject,—to ask pardon for intruding an opinion, not only unasked, but, in some measure repugnant to their resolves.</P>
<P>The disadvantages attending the limited enlistment of troops are too apparent to those who are eye-witnesses to them, to ren∣der any animadversions necessary: but to gentlemen at a dis∣tance, whose attention is engrossed by a thousand important ob∣jects, the case may be otherwise.</P>
<P>That this cause precipitated the fate of the brave and much-to-be-lamented
<PB N="74" REF="031423_0073_0FEC4B09BAF4ED10"/>
general Montgomery, and brought on the de∣feat which followed thereupon, I have not the most distant doubt:—for, had he not been apprehensive of the troops leav∣ing him at so important a crisis, but continued the blockade at Quebec, a capitulation (from the best accounts I have been a∣ble to collect) must inevitably have followed. And that we were not at one time obliged to dispute these lines under disad∣vantageous circumstances (proceeding from the same cause, to wit, the troops disbanding of themselves before the militia could be got in), is to me a matter of wonder and astonishment; and proves that general Howe was either unacquainted with our situati∣on, or restrained by his instructions from putting any thing to a hazard till his reinforcements should arrive.</P>
<P>The instance of general Montgomery—(I mention it, because it is a striking one:—for a number of others might be adduced)—proves, that, instead of having men to take advantage of circumstances, you are in a manner compelled, right or wrong, to make circumstances yield to a secondary consideration. Since the first of December, I have been devising every means in my power to secure these encampments: and, though I am sensible that we never have, since that period, been able to act upon the offensive, and at times not in a condition to defend, yet the cost of marching home one set of men,—bringing in another,—the havoc and waste occasioned by the first,—the repairs necessa∣ry for the second,—with a thousand incidental charges and in∣conveniences which have arisen, and which it is scarcely possi∣ble either to recollect or describe,—amount to near as much, as the keeping up a respectable body of troops the whole time, ready for any emergency would have done.—To this may be added, that you never can have a well-disciplined army.</P>
<P>To bring men well acquainted with the duty of a soldier, re∣quires time. To bring them under proper discipline and subor∣dination not only requires time, but is a work of great diffi∣culty, and in this army where there is so little distinction be∣tween the officers and soldiers, requires an uncommon degree of attention. To expect then the same service from raw and undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers, is to expect what never did and perhaps never will happen. Men who are familiarised to danger meet it without shrinking; whereas those who have never seen service often apprehend danger where no danger is. Three things prompt men to a regular discharge of their duty in time of action,—natural bravery,—hope of re∣ward,—and fear of punishment. The two first are common to the untutored and the disciplined soldier: but the latter most
<PB N="75" REF="031423_0074_0FEC4B0EF0C7ABC0"/>
obviously distinguishes the one from the other. A coward, when taught to believe, that, if he breaks his ranks and aban∣dons his colors, he will be punished with death by his own par∣ty,—will take his chance against the enemy: but a man who thinks little of the one and is fearful of the other, acts from present feelings, regardless of consequences.</P>
<P>Again men of a day's standing will not look forward: and from experience we find, that, as the time approáchcs for their discharge they grow careless of their arms, ammunition, camp utensils, &amp;c. Nay, even the barracks themselves have felt uncommon marks of wanton depredation, and lay us under fresh trouble and additional expense in providing for every fresh set, when we find it next to impossible to procure such articles as are absolutely necessary in the first instance. To this may be added the seasoning which new recruits must have to a camp, and the loss consequent thereupon. But this is not all—Men, engaged for a short limited time only, have the officers too much in their power: for, to obtain a degree of popularity in order to induce a second enlistment, a kind of familiarity takes place, which brings on a relaxation of discipline, unlicenced furloughs, and other indulgences incompatible with order and good government; by which means, the latter part of the time for which the soldier was engaged, is spent in undoing what you were aiming to inculcate in the first.</P>
<P>To go into an enumeration of all the evils we have experi∣enced in this late great change of the army, and the expences incidental to it,—to say nothing of the hazard we have run, and must run, between the discharging of one army and enlist∣ment of another, unless an enormous expense <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> militia is in∣curred,—would greatly exceed the bounds of a letter. What I have already taken the liberty of saying will serve to convey a general idea of the matter: and therefore I shall, with all due deference, take the freedom to give it as my opinion, that, if the Congress have any reason to believe that there will be occasion for troops another year, and consequently of another enlistment, they would save money, and have infinitely better troops, if they were, even at a bounty of twenty, thirty, or more dollars, to engage the men already enlisted (till January next), and such others as may be wanted to complete the en∣listment, for and during the war. I will not undertake to say that the men can be had upon these terms; but I am satisfied that it will never do, to let the matter alone, as it was last year, till the time of service was nearly expiring.

perplexity of disbanding one army and raising of another at the same instant, and in such a critical situation as the last was, is scarcely in the power of words to describe, and such as no man, who has experienced it once, will ever undergo again.</P>
<P>If Congress should differ from me in sentiments upon this point, I have only to beg that they will do me the justice to believe, that I have nothing more in view than what to me ap∣pears necessary to advance the public weal, although in the first instance it will be attended with a capital expence;—and that I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the resolves of Congress, I have ap∣plied to general Howe for the exchange of Mr. Lovell. A copy of my letter, and his answer thereto, you have inclosed.</P>
<P>Captain Watters and captain Tucker, who command two of the armed schooners, have taken and sent into Glocester a large brigantine, laden with wood, a hundred and fifty butts for wa∣ter, and forty suits of bedding bound from La Have in Nova∣Scotia, for Boston. She is one of the transports in the mini∣sterial service. The captain says that he was at Halifax, the se∣venteenth of January, and that general Massy was arrived there with two regiments from Ireland.</P>
<P>The different prizes were all libelled immediately on the re∣ceipt of the resolves of Congress pointing out the mode; but none of them yet brought to trial, owing to a difference be∣tween the law passed in this province, and the resolutions of Congress. The general court are making an amendment to their law, by which the difficulties that now occur will be re∣moved, as I understand it is to be made conformable to your resolves. The unavoidable delay attending the bringing the captors to trial is grievously complained of by the masters of these vessels, as well as the captors. Many of the former have ap∣plied for liberty to go away without waiting the decision,—which I have granted them.</P>
<P>I beg leave to recall the attention of Congress to their ap∣pointing a commissary in these parts, to attend the providing of necessaries for the prisoners who are dispersed in these pro∣vinces. Complaints are made by some of them, that they are in want of bedding and many other things. As I understand that Mr. Franks has undertaken that business, I wish he was ordered to send a deputy immediately to see that the prisoners
<PB N="77" REF="031423_0076_0FEC4B10A24C3A48"/>
get what is allowed them by Congress; also to supply the offi∣cers with money as they may have occasion. It would save me much time and much trouble.</P>
<P>There are yet but few companies of the militia come in. This delay will, I am much afraid, frustrate the intention of their being called upon, as the season is slipping fast away when they may be of service.</P>
<P>The demands of the army were so very pressing before your last remittance came to hand, that I was under the necessity of borrowing twenty-five thousand pounds, lawful money from this province. They very cheerfully lent it, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passed a vote for as much more, if required. I have not repaid the sum bor∣rowed, as I may stand in need of it before the arrival of an∣other supply, which the demands of the commissary-general quartermaster-general, and paying off the arrearages will very soon require.</P>
<P>Your esteemed favor of the twenty-ninth ultimo is just come to hand. It makes me very happy to find my conduct hath met the approbation of Congress. I am entirely of your opi∣nion, that, should an accommodation take place, the terms will be severe or favorable in proportion to our ability to resist, and that we ought to be on a respectable footing to receive their armaments in the spring. But how far we shall be pro∣vided with the means, is a matter I profess not to know, under my present unhappy want of arms, ammunition, and, I may add, men,—as our regiments are very incomplete. The re∣cruiting goes on very slow, and will, I apprehend, be more so, if for other service the men receive a bounty, and none is given here.</P>
<P>I have tried every method I could think of, to procure arms for our men. They really are not to be had in these govern∣ments (belonging to the public); and if some method is not fallen upon, in the southern governments, to supply us, we shall be in a distressed situation for want of them. There are near two thousand men now in camp without firelocks.—I have wrote to the committee of New-York this day, requesting them to send me those arms which were taken from the disaffected in that government. The Congress interesting themselves in this request will doubtless have a good effect. I have sent officers into the country, with money to purchase arms in the different towns. Some have returned, and brought in a few:—many are still out:—what their success will be, I cannot determine.</P>
<P>I was in great hopes that the expresses, resolved to be esta∣blished between this place and Philadelphia, would ere now
<PB N="78" REF="031423_0077_0FEC4B14433F0630"/>
have been fixed. It would, in my opinion, rather save than increase the expense; as many horses are destroyed by one man coming the whole way. It will certainly be more expeditious, and safer, than writing by the post or private hands, which I am often under the necessity of doing.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you, at the request of the com∣mittee of pay-table of the colony of Connecticut, that I have not advanced, to any of the regiments from that government, any money except the sum of seven thousand one hundred and seventy-two dollars and one-ninth, on the twentieth of Novem∣ber last, to major-general Putnam, for the thirty-fourth regi∣ment under his command. I should have paid them in the same manner I did the rest of the army, had I not been prevented by the colonels, who expressed their inclination to receive the whole at once, upon their return home, at the expiration of service, as was customary in their colony. For this reason, I never included them in my estimates of money, and have made no provision for their payment, always imagining that whatever payments the colony made them, Congress would apply to their credit in the general account against the United Colonies, or re∣fund upon application.</P>

<P>THROUGH you, I beg leave to lay before Congress the inclosed letter from Lord Drummond to general Robertson, which came to my hands a few days ago, in order to be sent into Boston.</P>
<P>As I never heard of his lordship being vested with power to treat with Congress upon the subject of our grievances, nor of his having laid any propositions before them for an accommo∣dation, I confess it surprised much, and led me to form va∣rious conjectures of his motives, and intended application to general Howe and admiral Shuldham for a passport, for the safe-conduct of such deputies as Congress might appoint for ne∣gociating terms of reconciliation between Great-Britain and us.—Whatever his intentions are, however benevolent his designs
<PB N="79" REF="031423_0078_0FEC4B1AD06D0078"/>
may be, I confess that his letter has embarressed me much; and I am not without suspicion of its meaning more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th gener∣ous purposes it professes. I should suppose, that, if the mode for negociation, which he points out, should be adopted (which I hope will never be thought of), it ought to have been fixed and settled previous to any application of this sort; and at best, that his conduct in this instance is premature and officious, and leading to consequences of a fatal and injurious nature to the rights of this country. His zeal and desire, perhaps, of an a∣micable and constitutional adjustment's taking place may have suggested and precipitated the measure. Be that as it may, I thought it of too much importance, to suffer it to go in without having the express direction of Congress for that purpose▪ and that it was my indispensable duty to transmit them the ori∣ginal, to make such interpretations and inferences as they may think right.</P>
<P>Messrs. Willard and Child, who were sent to Nova-Scotia in pursuance of the resolve of Congress, have just returned, and made their report, which I do myself the honor to enclose you. They have not answered the purposes of their commission by a∣ny means, as they only went a little way into that country, and found their intelligence upon the information of others. You will see the reasons they assign in excuse or justification of their conduct, in the report itself.</P>
<P>Last night a party of regulars, said to be about five hundred, landed on Dorchester neck, and burned some of the houses there, which were of no value to us; nor would they have been, unless we take post there; they then might be of some service. A detachment went after them as soon as the fire was discover∣ed: but, before it could arrive, they had executed their plan, and made their retreat.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a letter for David Franks, esquire, from Mr. Chamier in Boston, upon the subject of victualling such of the king's troops as may be prisoners within the limits of his con∣tract, which I beg the favor of you to deliver him, and that proper agents may be appointed by him, to see that it is done. I could wish too, that Congress would fall upon some mode for supplying the officers with such money as they may really stand in need of, and depute proper persons for that purpose, and furnishing the privates with such cloathing as may be absolutely necessary. I am applied to, and wearied by their repeated re∣quests. In some instances I have desired the committees to give the prisoners within their appointments, what they should judge absolutely necessary for their support,—as the only means
<PB N="80" REF="031423_0079_0FEC4B1C9A300290"/>
in my power of relieving their distress,—but I imagine, that, if there were persons to superintend this business, their wants would be better attended to, and many exorbitant charges pre∣vented and saved to the continent; and the whole would then be brought into a proper account.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE late freezing weather having formed some pretty strong ice from Dorchester point to Boston neck, and from Roxbury to the Common, thereby affording a more expanded and consequently a less dangerous approach to the town, I could not help thinking,—notwithstanding the militia were not all come in, and we had little or no powder to begin our operation by a regular cannonade or bombardment,—that a bold and re∣solute assault upon the troops in Boston with such men as we had (for it could not take many men to guard our own lines at a time when the enemy were attacked in all quarters) might be crowned with success: and therefore, seeing no certain prospect of a supply of powder on the one hand, and a certain dissolution of the ice on the other, I called the general officers together, for their opinion, agreeably to the resolve of Congress, of the twenty-second of December.</P>
<P>The result will appear in the enclosed council of war; and, being almost unanimous, I must suppose it to be right; al∣though, from a thorough conviction of the necessity of attempt∣ing something against the ministerial troops before a reinforce∣ment should arrive, and while we were favored with the ice, I was not only ready, but willing, and desirous of making the as∣sault, under a firm hope (if the men would have stood by me) of a favorable issue, notwithstanding the enemy's advantage of ground, artillery, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Perhaps the irksomeness of my situation may have given dif∣ferent ideas to me, than those which influenced the gentlemen I consulted, and might have inclined me to put more to the hazard, than was consistent with prudence:—If it had, I am not sensible of it, as I endeavored to give it all the considera∣tion that a matter of such importance required. True it is, and I cannot help acknowledging, that I have many disagreea∣ble sensations on account of my situation: for, to have the eyes of the whole continent fixed with anxious expectation of hear∣ing
<PB N="81" REF="031423_0080_0FEC4B1EAA967740"/>
of some great event,—and to be restrained in every military operation, for want of the necessary means of carrying it on,—is not very pleasing, especially as the means used to conceal my weakness from the enemy, conceal it also from our friends, and add to their wonder.</P>
<P>I do not utter this by way of complaint. I am sensible that all that the Congress could do, they have done; and I should feel most powerfully the weight of conscious ingratitude, were I not to acknowledge this. But as we have accounts of the arri∣val of powder in captain Mason, I would beg to have it sent on in the most expeditious manner: otherwise we not only lose all chance of the benefits resulting from the season, but of the militia, who are brought in at a most enormous expence, upon a pre∣sumption that we should, long ere this, have been amply supplied with powder, under the contracts entered into with the committee of Congress.</P>
<P>The militia, contrary to an express requisition, are come and coming in without ammunition. To supply them alone with twenty-four rounds (which is less by three fifths, than the regu∣lars are served with) will take between fifty and sixty barrels of powder; and to complete the other troops to the like quantity, will take near as much more, and leave in store not more than about sixty barrels, besides a few rounds of cannon cartridges ready filled for use. This, sir, Congress may be assured, is a true state of our powder, and will I hope bear some testimo∣ny of my incapacity for action in such a way as may do any es∣sential service.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 21. When I began this letter, I proposed to have sent it by express. But recollecting that all my late letters have been as expressive of my want of powder and arms as I could paint them, and that Mr. Hooper was to set off in a day or two, I thought it unnecessary to run the continent to the ex∣pense of an express, merely to repeat what I had so often done before, when I am certain that Congress, knowing our necessi∣ties, will delay no time that can possibly be avoided in supplying them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor of addressing you on the eighteenth and twenty-first instant, by Mr. Hooper; since which, nothing ma∣terial has occurred.</P>
<P>We are making every necessary preparation for taking posses∣sion of Dorchester heights as soon as possible, with a view of drawing the enemy out. How far our expectations may be an∣swered, time only can determine: but I should think, if any thing would induce them to hazard an engagement, it will be our attempting to fortify these heights; as on that event's taking place, we shall be able to command a great part of the town, and almost the whole harbor, and to make them rather disagreea∣ble than otherwise, provided we can get a sufficient supply of what we greatly want.</P>
<P>Within these three or four days, I have received sundry ac∣counts from Boston, of such movements there—(such as taking the mortars, from Bunker's hill,—the putting them, with seve∣ral pieces of heavy ordnance, on board of ship, with a quantity of bedding,—the ships all taking in water,—the baking a large quantity of biscuit, &amp;c.)—as to indicate an embarkation of the troops from thence. A Mr. Ides, who came out yesterday, says that the inhabitants of the town generally believe that they are about to remove either to New-York or Virginia, and that every vessel in the harbor, on Tuesday last, was taken up for government's service, and two months' pay advanced them.—Whether they really intend to embark, or whether the whole is a feint, is impossible for me to tell. However I have thought it expedient to send an express to general Lee, to inform him of it—(in order that he may not be taken by surprise, if their destination should be against New-York,)—and continued him on to you. If they do embark, I think the possessing them∣selves of that place, and of the North river, is the object they have in view, thereby securing the communication with Canada, and rendering the intercourse between the northern and southern United Colonies exceedingly precarious and dif∣ficult. To prevent them from effecting their plan, is a mat∣ter of the highest importance, and will require a large and respectable army, and the most vigilant and judicious exer∣tions.</P>
<P>Since I wrote by Mr. Hooper, some small parcels of pow∣der have arrived from Connecticut, which will give us a little assistance.</P>
<P>On thursday night a party of our men at Roxbury made the
<PB N="83" REF="031423_0082_0FEC4B225D3A1610"/>
enemy's out-centuries, consisting of a corporal and two privates, prisoners, without firing a gun or giving the least alarm.</P>
<P>I shall be as attentive to the enemy's motions as I can, and obtain all the intelligence in my power; and, if I find them embark, shall in the most expeditious manner detach a part of the light troops to New-York, and repair thither myself if cir∣cumstances shall require it. I shall be better able to judge what to do, when the matter happens. At present, I can on∣ly say, that I will do every thing that shall appear proper and necessary.</P>
<P>Your letter of the twelfth instant, by colonel Bull, came to hand yesterday evening: and I shall agreeable to your recommen∣dation, pay proper notice to him.—The supply of cash came very seasonably, as our treasury was just exhausted, and nothing can be done here without it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the twenty-sixth ultimo I had the honor of addressing you, and then mentioned that we were making preparations for taking possession of Dorchester heights.—I now beg leave to in∣form you, that a council of general officers having determined a previous bombardment and cannonade expedient and proper, in order to harrass the enemy and divert their attention from that quarter,—on saturday, sunday and monday nights last, we carried them on from our posts at Coble-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill, Leechmore's point, and Lam's-dam. Whether they did the enemy any con∣siderable and what injury, I have not yet heard, but have the pleasure to acquaint you that they greatly facilitated our schemes, and would have been attended with success equal to our most san∣guine expectations, had it not been for the unlucky bursting of two thirteen, and three ten-inch mortars, among which was the brass one taken in the ordnance brig. To what cause to attri∣bute this misfortune, I know not,—whether to any defect in them, or to the inexperience of the bombardiers. But to re∣turn,—on monday evening, as soon as our firing commenced, a considerable detachment of our men, under the command of brigadier-general Thomas, crossed the neck, and took possession of the two hills, without the least interruption or annoyance
<PB N="84" REF="031423_0083_0FEC4B247ABD3F28"/>
from the enemy; and by their great activity and industry, before the morning, advanced the works so far as to be secure against their shot. They are now going on with such expedition, that in a little time I hope they will be complete, and enable our troops stationed there to make a vigorous and obstinate stand.—During the whole cannonade, which was incessant the last two nights, we were fortunate enough to lose but two men,—one, a lieutenant, by a cannon ball's taking off his thigh,—the other, a private, by the explosion of a shell, which also slightly wounded four or five more.</P>
<P>Our taking possession of Dorchester heights is only preparatory to taking post on Nuke-hill, and the points opposite the south end of Boston. It was absolutely necessary that they should be previously fortified, in order to cover and command them.—As soon as the works on the former are finished and complete, measures will be immediately adopted for securing the latter, and making them as strong and defensible as we can. Their con∣tiguity to the enemy will make them of much importance, and of great service to us.</P>
<P>As mortars are essential, and indispensably necessary for carry∣ing on our operations, and for the prosecution of our plans, I have applied to two furnaces to have some thirteen inch ones cast with all expedition imaginable, and am encouraged to hope, from the accounts I have had, that they will be able to do it. When they are done, and a proper supply of powder obtained, I flatter myself, from the posts we have just taken and are about to take, that it will be in our power to force the ministerial troops to an attack, or to dispose of them in some way that will be of advantage to us. I think from these posts they will be so galled and annoyed, that they must either give us battle or quit their present possessions. I am resolved that nothing on my part shall be wanting, to effect the one or the other.</P>
<P>It having been the general opinion that the enemy would at∣tempt to dislodge our people from the hills, and force their works as soon as they were discovered, which probably might have brought on a general engagement,—it was thought ad∣visable that the honorable council should be applied to, to order in the militia from the neighboring and adjacent towns. I wrote to them on the subject, which they most readily complied with: and in justice to the militia, I cannot but inform you that they came in at the appointed time, and manifested the greatest alertness and determined resolution to have acted like men engaged in the cause of freedom.</P>
<P>When the enemy first discovered our works in the morning,
<PB N="85" REF="031423_0084_0FEC4B2FB52F95D8"/>
they seemed to be in great confusion, and, from their move∣ments, to have intended an attack. It is much to be wished that it had been made: the event, I think, must have been fortunate, and nothing less than success and victory on our side, as our officers and men appeared impatient for the appeal, and to have possessed the most animated sentiments and determined re∣solution.</P>
<P>On tuesday evening a considerable number of their troops, embarked on board of their transports, and fell down to the castle, where part of them landed before dark. One or two of the vessels got a-ground, and were fired at by our people with a field-piece, but without any damage.—What was the design of this embarkation and landing, I have not been able to learn. It would seem as if they meant an attack; for it is most proba∣ble, that, if they make one on our works at Dorchester at this time, they will first go to the castle, and come from thence. If such was their design, a violent storm that night, and which lasted till eight o'clock the next day, rendered the execution of it impracticable. It carried one or two of their vessels on shore, which have since got off.</P>
<P>In case the ministerial troops had made an attempt to dislodge our men from Dorchester hills, and the number detached upon the occasion had been so great as to have afforded a probability of a successful attack's being made upon Boston,—on a signal given from Roxbury, for that purpose, agreeable to a settled and con∣certed plan, four thousand chosen men, who were held in rea∣diness, were to have embarked at the mouth of Cambridge river, in two divisions, the first under the command of briga∣dier-general Sullivan, the second under brigadier-general Greene,—the whole to have been commanded by major-general Put∣nam. The first division was to land at the powder-house, and gain possession of Bacon-Hill and Mount-Horam,—the second at Barton's point or a little south of it, and, after securing that post, to join the other division, and force the enemy's gates and works at the neck, for letting in the Roxbury troops. Three floating bat∣teries were to have preceded, and gone in front of the other boats, and kept up a heavy fire on that part of the town where our men were to land.</P>
<P>How far our views would have succeeded, had an opportuni∣ty offered for attempting the execution, is impossible for me to say: nothing less than experiment could determine with pre∣cision. The plan was thought to be well digested; and, as far as I could judge from the cheerfulness and alacrity which dis∣tinguished
<PB N="86" REF="031423_0085_0FEC4B34562D3348"/>
the officers and men who were to engage in the enter∣prise, I had reason to hope for a favorable and happy issue.</P>
<P>The militia who were ordered in from the adjacent towns bro't with them three day's provision. They were only called upon to act under the idea of an attack's being immediately made, and were all discharged this afternoon.</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind Congress that three major-generals are essential and necessary for this army; and that, by general Lee's being called from hence to the command in Canada, the left division is without one. I hope they will fill up the vacancy by the appointment of another. General Thomas is the first brigadier, stands fair in the point of reputation, and is esteemed a brave and good officer. If he is promoted, there will be a vacancy in the brigadier-generals, which it will be necessary to supply by the appointment of some other gentleman that shall be agreeable to Congress: But justice requires me to mention that William Thompson, esquire, of the rifle regiment, is the first co∣lonel in this department, and, as far as I have had an opportunity of judging, is a good officer and a man of courage. What I have said of these two gentlemen, I conceived to be my duty, at the same time acknowledging, whatever promotions are made will be satisfactory to me.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 9.—Yesterday evening, a captain Irvine, who es∣caped from Boston the night before, whith six of his crew, came to head-quarters, and gave the following intelligence:—"That our bombardment and cannonade caused a great deal of surprise and alarm in town, as many of the soldiery said they never heard or thought we had mortars or shells;—that several of the officers acknowledged they were well and properly directed;—that they made much distress and confusion:—that the cannon∣shot, for the greatest part, went through the houses; and he was told that one took off the legs and arms of six men lying in the barracks on the neck;—that a soldier, who came from the lines, there on tuesday morning informed him that twenty men had been wounded the night before; it was reported that others were also hurt, and one of the light horse torn to pieces by the explosion of a shell: (this was afterwards contradicted:)—that, early on tuesday morning, admiral Shuldham, disco∣vering the works our people were throwing up on Dorchester heights, immediately sent an express to general Howe, to inform him that it was necessary they should be attacked and dis∣lodged from thence, or he would be under the necessity of with∣drawing the ships from the harbor, which were under his com∣mand;—that preparations were directly made for that purpose,
<PB N="87" REF="031423_0086_0FEC4B3665659008"/>
as it was said; and, from twelve to two o'clock, about three thousand men embarked on board the transports, which fell down to the castle with a design of landing on that part of Dor∣chester next to it, and attacking our works on the heights at five o'clock the next morning;—that lord Percy was appointed to command;—that it was generally believed the attempt would have been made, had it not been for the violent storm which happened that night, as I have mentioned before;—that he heard several of the privates, and one or two serjeants, say as they were embarking, "that it would be another Bunker's-hill affair."</P>
<P>He further informs—"that the army is preparing to leave Boston, and that they will do it in a day or two;—that the transports necessary for their embarkation were getting ready with the utmost expedition;—that there had been great move∣ments and confusion among the troops, the night and day pre∣ceding his coming out, in hurrying down their cannon, artil∣lery and other stores, to the wharfs, with the utmost precipita∣tion, and they were putting them on board the ships in such haste, that no account or memorandum was taken of them;—that most of the cannon were removed from their works, and embarked or embarking;—that he heard a woman say, whom he took to be an officer's wife, that she had seen men go under the ground at the lines on the neck, without returning;—that the ship he commanded was taken up, places fitted, and fitting for officers to lodge, and several shot, shells and cannon alrea∣dy on board; that the tories were to have the liberty of going where they please, if they can get seamen to man the vessels, of whom there was a great scarcity;—that, on that account, many vessels could not be carried away, and would be burned;—that many of the inhabitants apprehended the town would be de∣stroyed; and that it was generally thought their destination is Halifax."</P>
<P>The account given by captain Irvine, as to the embarkation, and their being about to leave the town, I believe true. There are other circumstances corroborating; and it seems fully con∣firmed by a paper signed by four of the selectmen of the town, (a copy of which I have the honor to enclose you,) which was brought out yesterday evening by a flag, and delivered to colo∣nel Learned, by major Basset of the tenth regiment, who de∣sired it might be delivered me as soon as possible. I advised with such of the general officers upon the occasion, as I could immediately assemble; and we determined it right (as it was not addressed to me or any one else, nor authenticated by the sig∣nature
<PB N="88" REF="031423_0087_0FEC4B3A0F8C6860"/>
nature of general Howe, or any other act obliging him to a per∣formance of the promise mentioned on his part) that I should give it no answer; at the same time, that a letter should be returned, as going from colonel Learned, signifying his having laid it before me,—with the reasons assigned for not answering it.—A copy of this is sent.</P>
<P>To-night I shall have a battery thrown up on Nuke-hill (Dorchester point) with a design of acting as circumstances may require; it being judged advisable to prosecute our plans of fortifi∣cation as we intended, before this information from the selectmen came.</P>
<P>It being agreed on all hands that there is no possibility of stopping them in case they determine to go,—I shall order look-outs to be kept upon all the head-lands, to discover their movements and course, and moreover direct commodore Manly and his little squadron to dog them, as well for the same pur∣pose as for picking up any of their vessels that may chance to depart their convoy. From their loading with such precipi∣tancy, it is presumable they will not be in the best condition for sea.</P>
<P>If the ministerial troops evacuate the town and leave it standing, I have thoughts of taking measures for fortifying the entrance into the harbor, if it shall be thought proper, and the situation of af∣fairs will admit of it.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the report from Boston that Halifax is the place of their destination, I have no doubt but they are going to the southward of this,—and, I apprehend, to New-York. Many reasons lead to this opinion: it is in some measure corroborated by their sending an express ship there, which, on wednesday week, got on shore and bilged at Cape-Cod. The dispatches, if written, were destroyed when she was boarded. She had a parcel of coal, and about four thousand cannon shot, six carriage-guns, a swivel or two, and three barrels of powder.</P>
<P>I shall hold the riflemen and other parts of our troops in readi∣ness to march at a moment's warning, and govern my movements by the events that happen, or such orders as I may receive from Congress, which I beg may be ample, and forwarded with all pos∣sible expedition.</P>
<P>On the sixth instant, a ship bound from London, with stores for the ministerial army, consisting of coal, porter, and krout, fell in with our armed vessels, four of them in company, and was carried into Portsmouth. She had had a long passage, and of course brought no papers of late date. The only letters of
<PB N="89" REF="031423_0088_0FEC4B3C05D5BA88"/>
importance, or in the least interesting, that were found, I have inclosed.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congress that money is much wanted. The militia from these governments, engaged till the first of April, are then to be paid: and, if we march from hence, the expense will be very considerable, must be defrayed, and cannot be accomplished without it. The necessity of making the earliest remittance for these purposes is too obvious, for me to add more.</P>
<P>When I wrote that part of this letter which is antecedent to this date, I fully expected it would have gone before now by colonel Bull, not deeming it of sufficient importance to send a special messenger. But he deferred his return from time to time, and never set off till to-day. These reasons I hope will excuse the delay, and be received as a proper apology for not transmitting it sooner.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of the seventh and ninth instant which I had the honor of addressing you, I mentioned the intelli∣gence I had received respecting the embarkation of the troop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Boston; and fully expected, before this, that the town would have been entirely evacuated. Although I have been deceived, and was rather premature in the opinion I had then formed, I have little reason to doubt but the event will take place in a very short time, as other accounts which have come to hand since, of the sailing of a great number of transports from the harbor of Nantasket road, and many circumstances corresponding therewith, seem to confirm and render it unques∣tionable.</P>
<P>Whether the town will be destroyed, is a matter of much un∣certainty: but it would seem, from the destruction they are making of sundry pieces of furniture, of many of their waggons, carts, &amp;c. which they cannot take with them as it is said, that it will not: for, if they intended it, the whole might be involved in one general ruin.</P>
<P>Holding it of the last importance in the present contest that we should secure New-York, and prevent the enemy from pos∣sessing it,—and conjecturing they have views of that sort, and their embarkation to be for that purpose,—I judged it necessa∣ry, under the situation of things here, to call a council of gene∣ral
<PB N="90" REF="031423_0089_0FEC4B3E2A8018B0"/>
officers to consult of such measures as might be expedient to be taken at this interesting conjuncture of affairs. A copy of the pro∣ceedings I have the honor to enclose you.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the opinion of the council, I shall detach the rifle regiment to-morrow, under the command of brigadier-ge∣neral Sullivan, with orders to repair to New-York with all possible expedition; which will be succeeded, the day after, by the other five in one brigade,—they being all that it was thought advisable to send from hence till the enemy shall have quitted the town. Immediately upon their departure, I shall send forward major-general Putnam, and follow myself with the remainder of the army as soon as I have it in my power,—leaving here such a number of men as circumstances may seem to require.</P>
<P>As the badness of the roads at this season will greatly retard the march of our men, I have, by advice of the general officers, wrote to governor Trumbull by this express, to use his utmost ex∣ertions for throwing a reinforcement of two thousand men into New-York, from the western parts of Connecticut,—and to the commanding officer there, to apply to the provincial convention or committee of safety of New-Jersey, for a thousand more for the same purpose, to oppose the enemy and prevent their getting pos∣session, in case they arrive before the troops from hence can get there; of which there is a probability, unless they are impeded by contrary winds. This measure, though it may be attended with considerable expense, I flatter myself, will meet with the appro∣bation of Congress.—Past experience, and the lines in Boston and on Boston neck, point out the propriety, and suggest the necessity of keeping our enemies from gaining possession and making a lodg∣ment.</P>
<P>Should their destination be further southward, or for Hali∣fax (as reported in Boston) for the purpose of going into Cana∣da,—the march of our troops to New-York will place them nearer the scene of action, and more convenient for affording suc∣cours.</P>
<P>We have not taken post on Nuke-hill, and fortified it, as mentioned that we should, in my last. On hearing that the ene∣my were about to retreat and leave the town, it was thought imprudent and unadvisable to force them with two much preci∣pitation, that we might gain a little time, and prepare for a march. To-morrow evening we shall take possession, unless they are gone.</P>
<P>As New-York is of such importance,—prudence and policy require that every precaution that can be devised should be
<PB N="91" REF="031423_0090_0FEC4B4000711920"/>
adopted, to frustrate the designs which the enemy have of possess∣ing it. To this end I have ordered vessels to be provided and held ready at Norwich, for the embarkation and transporta∣tion of our troops thither. This I have done with a view not on∣ly of greatly expediting their arrival (as it will save several day's marching,) but also that they may be fresh and fit for intrench∣ing and throwing up works of defence as soon as they get there, if they do not meet the enemy to contend with;—for neither of which would they be in a proper condition after a long and fatiguing march in bad roads. If Wallace, with his ships, should be apprised of the measure, and attempt to prevent it by stopping up the harbour of New-London, they can but pursue their march by land.</P>
<P>You will please to observe that it is the opinion of the general officers, if the enemy abandon the town, that it will be unne∣cessary to employ or keep any part of this army for its defence; and that I have mentioned, on that event's happening, I shall immediately repair to New-York with the remainder of the army not now detached, leaving only such a number of men here as circumstances may seem to require. What I partly allude to, is, that, as it will take a considerable time for the removal of such a body of men, and the divisions must precede each other in such order as to allow intermediate time sufficient for them to be covered and provided for, and many things done pre∣vious to the march of the whole, for securing and forward∣ing such necessaries as cannot be immediately carried, and others which may be proper to keep here,—that directions might be received from Congress respecting the same, and as many men ordered to remain for that and other purposes, as they may judge proper. I could wish to have their commands upon the subject, and in time; as I may be under some degree of embarrassment as to their views.</P>
<P>Congress having been pleased to appoint colonel Thompson a brigadier-general, there is a vacancy for a colonel in the regi∣ment he commanded, to which I would beg leave to recommend the lieutenant-colonel Hand. I shall also take the liberty of recommending captain Hugh Stephenson, of the Virginia, rifle∣men, to succeed colonel Hand, and to be appointed in his place as a lieutenant colonel,—there being no major to the re∣giment since the promotion of major Magraw to be lieutenant-colonel of one of the Pennsylvania battalions, and who is gone from hence. He is, in my opinion, the fittest person in this army for it, as well as the oldest captain in the service, having distinguished himself at the head of a rifle company all the last
<PB N="92" REF="031423_0091_0FEC4B4281045488"/>
war, and highly merited the approbation of his superior offi∣cers.</P>
<P>Colonel Mifflin informed me to-day of his having received tent-cloths from Mr. Barrell of Philadelphia, to the amount of seven thousand five hundred pounds Pennsylvania currency, and applied for a warrant for payment of it. But, as our fund is low, and many necessary demands against it which must be sa∣tisfied,—and our calls for money are and will be exceedingly great,—I could not grant it, thinking it might be convenient for payment to be made in Philadelphia, by your order on the treasury there.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with the greatest pleasure I inform you, that, on sun∣day last, the seventeenth instant, about nine o'clock in the fore∣noon, the ministerial army evacuated the town of Boston, and that the forces of the United Colonies are now in actual possession there∣of. I beg leave to congratulate you, sir, and the honorable Con∣gress, on this happy event, and particularly as it was effected with∣out endangering the lives and property of the remaining unhappy inhabitants.</P>
<P>I have great reason to imagine their flight was precipitated by the appearance of a work which I had ordered to be thrown up last saturday night on an eminence at Dorchester, which lay nearest to Boston neck called Nuke-hill.</P>
<P>The town, although it has suffered greatly, is not in so bad a state as I expected to find it; and I have a particular pleasure in being able to inform you, sir, that your house has received no dam∣age worth mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable order, and the family pictures are all left entire and untouched. Captain Caz∣neau takes the charge of the whole, until he shall receive further orders from you.</P>
<P>As soon as the ministerial troops had quitted the town, I order∣ed a thousand men (who had had the small-pox,) under command of general Putnam, to take possession of the heights, which I shall endeavour to fortify in such a manner as to prevent their return, should they attempt it. But, as they are still in the harbor, I tho't it not prudent to march off with the main body of the army until I should be fully satisfied they had quitted the coast. I have there∣fore only detached five regiments, besides the rifle battalion, to
<PB N="93" REF="031423_0092_0FEC4B4879B51628"/>
New-York, and shall keep the remainder here till all suspicion of their return ceases.</P>
<P>The situation in which I found their works evidently disco∣vered that their retreat was made with the greatest precipita∣tion. They have left their barracks and other works of wood at Bunker's-hill, &amp;c. all standing, and have destroyed but a small part of their lines. They have also left a number of fine pieces of cannon which they first spiked up, also a very large iron mortar; and, as I am informed, they have thrown another over the end of your wharf. I have employed proper persons to drill the can∣non, and doubt not I shall save the most of them.—I am not yet able to procure an exact list of all the stores they have left.—As soon as it can be done, I shall take care to transmit it to you.—From an estimate of what the quarter-master-general has al∣ready discovered, the amount will be twenty-five or thirty thou∣sand pounds.</P>
<P>Part of the powder mentioned in yours of the sixth instant, has already arrived. The remainder I have ordered to be stopped on the road, as we shall have no occasion for it here.—The letter to general Thomas, I immediately sent to him. He desired leave for three or four days, to settle some of his private affairs; after which he will set out for his command in Canada.—I am happy that my conduct in intercepting lord Drummond's letter is approv∣ed of by Congress.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honor to address you on the nineteenth instant upon the evacuation of the town of Boston by the mi∣nisterial army, I fully expected, as their retreat and embarkation were hurried and precipitate, that, before now, they would have departed the harbor, and been far in their passage to the place of their destination. But, to my surprise and disappoint∣ment, the fleet is still in Nantasket road. The purpose induc∣ing their stay is altogetoer unknown: nor can I suggest any satisfactory reason for it. On wednesday night last, before the whole of the fleet fell down to Nantasket, they demolished the castle and houses belonging to it, by burning them down, and the several fortifications. They left a great number of cannon, but have rendered all of them except a very few, entirely use∣less, by breaking off the trunnions; and those they spiked up:
<PB N="94" REF="031423_0093_0FEC4B4E80BC1858"/>
but they may be made serviceable again:—some are already done.</P>
<P>There are several vessels in the docks, which were taken by the enemy (some with, and others without cargoes,) which dif∣ferent persons claim as their property and right. Are they to be restored to their former owners on making proof of their title, or to belong to the continent, as captures made from the enemy?—I wish Congress would direct a mode of proceeding against them, and establish a rule for decision: they appear to me to be highly necessary. In like manner, some of the can∣non which are in Boston are said to have come from the castle. Supposing them, with those remaining at the castle, to have been purchased by and provided originally at the expence of this province,—are they now to be considered as belonging to it, or to the public? I beg leave to refer the matter to the opinion of Congress, and pray their direction how I am to conduct respect∣ing them.</P>
<P>It having been suggested to me that there was considerable property, &amp;c. belonging to persons who had, from the first of the present unhappy contest, manifested an unfriendly and inveter∣ate disposition, in the town of Boston, I thought it prudent to write to the honorable general court upon the subject, that it might be enquired after and secured. A copy of the letter I herewith send you, and submit it to Congress through you, whether they will not determine how it is to be disposed of, and as to the appropriation of the money arising from the sale of the same.</P>
<P>As soon as the town was abandoned by the enemy, I judged it advisable to secure the several heights, lest they should attempt to return; and, for this purpose, have caused a large and strong work to be thrown up at Fort-hill, a post of great im∣portance, as it commands the whole harbor, and, when fortified, if properly supported, will greatly annoy any fleet the enemy may send against the town, and render the landing of their troops exceedingly difficult, if not impracticable. This work is almost done, and in a little time will be complete: and, that the communication between the town and country may be free and open, I have ordered all the lines upon the neck to be im∣mediately destroyed, and the other works on the sides of the town facing the country, that the inhabitants from the latter may not be impeded, and afforded an easy entrance, in case the enemy should gain possession at any future time. These mat∣ters I conceived to be within the line of my duty; of which I advised the general court, and recommended to their attention
<PB N="95" REF="031423_0094_0FEC4B507A96BBC8"/>
such other measures as they might think necessary for securing the town against the hostile designs of the enemy.</P>
<P>I have just got an inventory of stores and property belonging to the crown, which the enemy left in Boston, at the castle, and Bunker's-hill,—which I have the honor to transmit you; and shall give strict orders that a careful attention be had to any more that may be found. I shall take such precautions re∣specting them, that they may be secure, and turn to the pub∣lic advantage, as much as possible, or circumstances will admit of.</P>
<P>A Mr. Bulfinch from Boston, who acted as a clerk to Mr. . . . . . ., having put into my hands a lift of rations drawn the saturday before the troops evacuated the town, I have inclosed it for your inspection. He says, neither the staff officers nor women are included in the list; from which it appears that their number is greater than we had an idea of.</P>
<P>Major-general Ward and brigadier general Fyre are desirous of leaving the service, and, for that purpose, have requested me to lay the matter before Congress that they may be allowed to resign their commissions. The papers containing their applications you will herewith receive. They will give you a full and more particular information upon the subject; and therefore I shall take the liberty of referring you to them.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congress that the commissary of artillery stores has informed me, that whatever powder has been sent to this camp has always come without any bill ascertaining the number of casks or quantity. This it is probable, has proceed∣ed from forgetfulness or inattention in the persons appointed to send it, or the negligence of those who brought it, though they have declared otherwise, and that they never had any. As it may in some measure prevent embezzlements (though I do not suspect any to have been made), and the commissary will know what and how much to receive, and be enabled to discover mis∣takes if any should happen,—I should be glad if you will direct a bill of parcels to be always sent in future.</P>
<P>There have been so many accounts from England, all agree∣ing that commissioners are coming to America, to propose terms for an accommodation, as they say,—that I am inclined to think the time of their arrival not very far off.—If they come to Bos∣ton (which probably will be the case, if they come to America at all) I shall be under much embarressment respecting the manner of receiving them, and the mode of treatment that ought to be used. I therefore pray that Congress will give me directions, and point out the line of conduct to be pursued,—
<PB N="96" REF="031423_0095_0FEC477EC83618B8"/>
whether they are to be considered as ambassadors and to have a pass or permit for repairing through the country to Philadelphia or to any other place,—or whether they are to be restrained in any and what manner. I shall anxiously wait their orders, and, whatever they are, comply with them literally.</P>

<P>I received your favor of the eleventh instant by saturday night's post; and must beg pardon for not acknowledging it in my last of the twenty-fourth. The hurry I was then in occasioned the neg∣lect▪ and I hope will apologise for it.</P>
<P>I now beg leave to inform you that I have just received in∣telligence, that the whole of the ministerial fleet, besides three or four ships, got under way this evening at Nantasket road, and were standing out for sea; in consequence of which, I shall detach a brigade of six regiments immediately from hence for New-York, under the command of brigadier-general Sullivan (brigadier-general Heath having gone with the first); which will be succeeded by another in a day or two; and directly after, I shall forward the remainder of the army (except four or five regiments which will be left for taking care of the bar∣racks and public stores, and fortifying the town, and erecting such works for its defence as the honorable general court may think necessary)—and follow myself.</P>
<P>Apprehending that general Thomas will stand in need of some artillerists in Canada, I have ordered two companies of the train to march immediately: and two mortars, with a quan∣tity of shells and shot, to be sent him.—He set out on the twenty-first instant.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have a copy of the return of ordnance stores left in Boston by the enemy. In it are not included the cannon left at the castle, amounting to a hundred and thirty-five pieces, as reported, all of which, except a very few, they have destroyed and rendered useless, by knocking off the trunnions, and spik∣ing up.</P>
<P>I beg leave to transmit you the copy of a petition from the inhabitants of Nova-Scotia, brought me by * * * esquire, mentioned therein, who is now here with an Acadian. From this it appears they are in a distressed situation; and, from Mr. * * *'s account, are exceedingly apprehensive that they will

be reduced to the disagreeable alternative of taking up arms and joining our enemies, or to flee their country, unless they can be protected against their insults and oppressions. He says that their committees think many salutary and valuable consequences would be derived from five or six hundred men being sent there, as it would not only quiet the minds of the people from the anxiety and uneasiness they are now filled with, and enable them to take a part in behalf of the colonies, but be the means of preventing the Indians (of whom there are a good many) from taking the side of government, and the ministerial troops from getting such supplies of provisions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as they have done.</P>
<P>How far these good purposes would be answered if such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> force was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent as they ask for, is impossible to determine in the present incertain state of things.

It being a matter of some importance, I judge it prudent to lay it before Congress for their consideration; and, requesting their di∣rection upon the subject, shall only add, if they determine to a∣dopt it, that they will prescribe the number to be sent, and whe∣ther it is to be from the regiments which will be left here.—I shall wait their decision, and, whatever it is, will endeavor to have it carried into execution.</P>

<P>I WAS honored with your favors of the twenty-first and twenty-fifth ultimo, on the second instant,—the former by Mr. Hanson, &amp;c,—the latter by Fessenden. I heartily wish the money had arrived sooner, that the militia might have been paid as soon as their time of service expired. The disappoin∣ment has given them great uneasiness, and they are gone home much dissatisfied: nor have I been without severe complains from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other troops, on the same account. When I get to New-York, I hope a sufficient sum will be there, ready to pay eve∣ry claim.</P>
<P>It is not in my power to make report of the deficiency of arms, in compliance with the direction of Congress, at this time,
<PB N="99" REF="031423_0098_0FEC4B5D591C1DA8"/>
as some of the regiments are at, and most of the other on their march to New-York; nor do I know that it would answer any good purpose, if it were,—having made repeated applications to the several assemblies and conventions upon the subject, and constantly received for answer, that they could afford no relief.</P>
<P>When I arrive at New-York, I shall, in pursuance of the order of Congress, detach four battalions to Canada, if the situation of affairs will admit of it; and shall be extremely happy if they and the troops already there can effect the important end of their going.</P>
<P>In my letter of the first instant, per post, I inclosed you a copy of a letter from governor Cooke, advising me of the arri∣val of a ship of war, &amp;c. at and near the harbor of Newport. I have now the pleasure to inform you that the report was en∣tirely premature, and without any foundation. You have a copy of his letter of the first instant to this effect,—I wish the alarm had never been given: it occasioned general Sullivan and his brigade to make an unnecessary and inconvenient diversion from their route.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a copy of an account, presented by the honorable general court, of powder furnished the continental army by this colony. From the account, it appears that part of it was sup∣plied before the army was under my command; and therefore I know nothing of it; but have not the smallest doubt of the justice of the charge. I shall leave about two hundred barrels of this article with major-general Ward, out of which Congress will direct him to make a return, if they think proper,—and also repayment of what may have been furnished by the other govern∣ments.</P>
<P>A proclamation of general Howe's, issued a few days before his departure from town, having fallen into my hands, I have inclosed you a copy, which will probably have been the occa∣sion of large quantities of goods being carried away and the removal of many persons, which otherwise would not have hap∣pened.</P>
<P>Colonel Warren, paymaster-general, finding the army likely to be removed from hence, informed me the other day that the situation of his affairs and engagements in the business of the colony are such, as to prevent him from personally attendning the army; and offered, in case it should be required, to resign. This was rather embarrassing. To me it appears indispensably necessary that the paymaster-general, with his books, should be at or near head-quarters, Indeed it is usual for the head of every department in the army, however dispersed that army
<PB N="100" REF="031423_0099_0FEC47A0F80A5428"/>
may be, to be with the commanding general, keeping deputies in the smaller departments. On the other hand, colonel War∣re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s merit and attachment to the cause are such, that I could do nothing less than desire (as some money must be left for the pay and contingent charges of the army which will remain here), he would wait here till Congress shall be pleased to give their sentiments upon the matter,—sending, in the mean time, some person in whom he could confide, with the money, but little of which there will be to carry, though great the de∣mands, as nine of the regiments which have marched to New-York have only received five hundred pounds each, towards their pay for the months of February and March,—and for others, not a farthing. I hope therefore this matter will be considered by Congress, and the result transmitted me as soon as done.</P>
<P>I would also mention to Congress that the militia regiments which were last called upon, in making up their abstracts, charged pay,—the officers, from the time they received orders to raise companies,—and the privates, from the time they re∣spectively engaged to come or were called upon, though they did not march for a considerable time after,—some not within three, four, or twenty days, during all which, they remained at home about their own private affairs, without doing any thing else than "preparing for the march," as they say by way of plea. This appeared to me so exceedingly unreasonable, and so contrary to justice, that the public should pay for a longer time than from the day of their march to that of their return, that I ordered the abstracts to be made out accordingly, and refused to give warrants on any other terms. They say that the enlisting orders, which went out from their governments, give them the pay they claim. The fact may be that something in these may seem to authorise it: but I must submit it to Congress, and wish for their decision, whether the continent must pay it.—I am, with great esteem, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to inform you that on the fourth instant I set out from Cambridge, and arrived here on saturday last. I came through Providence, Norwich, and New-London, in order to see and expedite the embarkation of the troops. The third brigade, under the command of general Greene, was at New-London
<PB N="101" REF="031423_0100_0FEC47A36FF28940"/>
when I left it, where there was a sufficient number of trans∣ports to embark them,—and most probably would have arrived here before this, had it not been for a severe storm which happened the night they sailed, which dispersed them, and, I fear, has done them some injury.</P>
<P>General Spencer, with the last brigade, marched from Rox∣bury the day I left Cambridge, and would be at New-London, ready to embark in the return transports which brought general Sullivan's division to this place. The whole of the troops may be reasonably expected here in the course of this week. The badness of the roads, and difficulty of procuri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g teams for bringing the stores, baggage, &amp;c. have greatly prolonged their arrival at this place.</P>
<P>I have not had time, since I came, to look fully about me; but find many works of defence begun, and some finished.—The troops are much dispersed,—some on Long-Island, others on Staten-Island, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have ordered four battalions from hence to Canada, and am taking measures to have them forwarded to Albany by wa∣ter with all possible expedition. This will greatly expe∣dite their arrival, and ease the men of much fatigue. I have wrote general Schuyler of their coming, that he may have necessary measures taken to hurry their march to general Tho∣mas.</P>
<P>I am informed by general Putnam that the militia, that were called in for the support of this town, in case the ministerial army had arrived before our troops, are all discharged, it being unneces∣sary to keep them longer.</P>
<P>All the ships of war, besides the Asia, moved out of this harbor on saturday, and the Asia yesterday; some of which are now below the Narrows, and the rest gone to sea.</P>
<P>Your favor of the tenth instant, by major Sherburne, directed to general Putnam or the commanding officer here, came to hand on saturday evening, with three boxes of money, which I shall deliver the paymaster as soon as he arrives, and transmit you his receipt for the same.</P>
<P>Having received information from hence before my depar∣ture from Cambridge, that thirty pieces of heavy cannon were wanting, and essentially necessary for the defence of this place, in addition to those already here,—I took the liberty of apply∣ing to admiral Hopkins, whom I saw at New-London, for that number, with the mortars and stores he brought from Provi∣dence,—a list of which he had transmitted you. He told me, that, as many were wanting for the defence of Providence river
<PB N="102" REF="031423_0101_0FEC4B609A256BA0"/>
and the harbor at New-London, it was uncertain whether I could have all I wanted; but that he would send me all that could b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spared.</P>
<P>I have not been able to get a return of the troops since I came:—as soon as I do, I will send it you.</P>

<P>PERMIT me, through you, to convey to the honorable Congress the sentiments of gratitude I feel for the high honor they have done me in the public mark of approbation contain∣ed in your favor of the second instant, which came to hand last night. I beg you to assure them that it will ever be my highest ambition to approve myself a faithful servant of the public; and that, to be in any degree instrumental in procuring to my American brethren a restitution of their just rights and privileges, will con∣stitute my chief happiness.</P>
<P>Agreeable to your request, I have communicated, in general orders, to the officers and soldiers under my command, the thanks of Congress for their good behaviour in the service; and am happy in having such an oppertunity of doing justice to their merit. They were indeed, at first, "<HI>a band of undisciplined husbandmen:</HI>" but it is (under God) to their bravery and attention to their duty, that I am indebted for that success, which has procured me the only reward I wish to receive,—the affection and esteem of my countrymen.</P>
<P>The medal, intended to be presented to me by your honora∣ble body, I shall carefully preserve as a memorial of their re∣gard. I beg leave to return you, sir, my warmest thanks for the polite manner in which you have been pleased to express their sentiments of my conduct; and am, with sincere esteem and respect, sir, yours and their most obedient and most humble servant.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment received a letter from general Schuyler, containing inclosures of a very important nature, co∣pies of which, I imagine, are contained in the inclosed letter to you, which I thought it my duty immediately to forward by express, that they may be laid before the honorable Congress,
<PB N="103" REF="031423_0102_0FEC4B629CFEBAC0"/>
and proper measures pursued to prevent the fatal effects which are therein apprehended. For my own part, I have done my utmost to forward the four regiments ordered by Congress but a variety of incidents have hitherto conspired to prevent their embarkation. The men had scarcely recovered them∣selves from the fatigues of their march from Boston, and are quite unprovided with necessaries. The colonels of the regi∣ments, though repeatedly called upon for that purpose, had ne∣glected making out the abstracts for their pay. All obstacles however, are now removed; and I hope to begin the embarka∣tion this day. Indeed it would have been best, in my opinion, to have sent the regiments, raised in this province and New-Jersey, upon that service, had not the peculiar circumstances under which they were raised prevented it. By the terms of their enlistment, they are to serve during the war, and at five dollars per month, on condition, (as I am informed) that they shall not be sent out of those provinces. Besides, they are very ill provided with arms, some companies not having any. It must be a great burden upon the continent to keep such a number of useless men in pay: and yet, if they should be dismissed, and an unexpec∣ted supply of arms should arrive, it may be sound very difficult to replace them.</P>
<P>The officers of the several corps that have arrived here have been so busily employed in fixing their men in quarters, that I have not yet been able to procure an exact return of their numbers. Some are yet behind. As soon as the whole are collected, I shall order the proper returns, and transmit them to Congress.</P>
<P>You will please to notice what colonel Hazen says of the disposition of the Indians. In my opinion, it will be impossi∣ble to keep them in a state of neutrality. They must, and, no doubt, soon will take an active part either for or against us: and I submit it to the consideration of Congress, whether it would not be best immediately to engage them on our side, and to use our utmost endeavors to prevent their minds being poi∣soned by ministerial emissaries, which will ever be the case while a king's garrison is suffered to remain in their country. Would it not therefore be advisable to send a sufficient force from the back counties of Pennsylvania, to take possession of the garrisons of Nia∣gara and Detroit? This, I think, might easily be effected, and would answer the most salutary purposes. The Seneca Indians, who have hitherto appeared friendly to us, might be usefully em∣ployed in this business.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="031423_0103_0FEC4B645B97EF30"/>
I am in hopes most of the difficulties mentioned in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hazen's letter will be obviated by the appearance of the re∣spectable committee of Congress in Canada, and the forces that have been and will be sent there. The security of that coun∣try is of the utmost importance to us. This cannot be done so effectually by conquest, as by taking strong hold of the affecti∣ons and confidence of the inhabitants. It is to be lamented that any conduct of the continental troops should tend to alienate their affections from us.</P>
<P>The honorable Congress will be able to judge from the papers sent them by general Schuyler, and information they may receive of the designs of the enemy, whether it is expedient to send a further reinforcement to Canada. If such should be their determi∣nation, I stand ready to execute their orders; and am, with respect, sir, your most obedient, humble servant.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this day honored with the receipt of your favor of the twentieth instant. I have now the pleasure to acquaint you that the four regiments designed for Canada embarked yes∣terday with a fair wind for Albany, under the command of colonels Greaton, Patterson, Bond, and Poor; besides which, there was a company of riflemen, a company of artificers, and two engineers,—the whole commanded by brigadier-general Thompson.</P>
<P>I have repeatedly mentioned to the honorable Congress the distressful situation we are in for want of arms.—With much pains and difficulty I got most of the regiments from the east∣ward tolerably well furnished; but find the York regiments very badly provided. Colonel Ritzema's has scarcely any: and yet these men, being enlisted during the war, and at five dollars per month, ought not (in my judgment) to be discharged; as we find it almost as difficult to get men, as arms. This is a matter of some importance, which I should be glad to receive the particular opinion of Congress upon.</P>
<P>Mr. Baldwin is one of the assistant engineers ordered to Ca∣nada. He is indeed a very useful man in this department, but
<PB N="105" REF="031423_0104_0FEC4B68EA37E838"/>
declined the service, on account of the pay, which he says is inadequate to his support. In order to induce him to continue, I promised to represent his case to Congress, and would recommend an increase of his pay, and that he should have the rank of lieutenant-colonel, of which he is very deserving. I beg leave therefore to recommend him to Congress, and that they would make provision for him accordingly.</P>
<P>A few days ago, application was made to me by the commit∣tee of safety for this colony, for an exchange of prisoners. For the particulars I beg leave to refer you to their letter, a copy of which you have inclosed. As there is a standing or∣der of Congress that no sailors or soldiers shall be exchanged for citizens, I did not incline to comply with the request with∣out the particular direction of Congress: but I have been since informed, that the prisoners, mentioned in the committee's let∣ter as citizens, are really seamen taken from private vessels, but not in arms. How far this may alter the case, or how far the reasons which induced the Congress to pass the resolve above-mentioned may still exist, must be left to their determination.</P>
<P>The militia, who, on my application were ordered to this place to keep possession until I should arrive with the continen∣tal forces, were obliged to return home without their pay, as there was not then money sufficient in the treasury for that purpose, and to answer the exigencies of the army. This occa∣sioned great uneasiness among them, and may be attended with very bad consequences in case we should have occasion for their service on any future emergency. I therefore beg the Con∣gress would make provision for their pay, and point out parti∣cularly, whether it is to be done by the commander of the continental forces, or by the provincial assemblies or conventions from whence they are sent.</P>
<P>As the time for which the riflemen enlisted, will expire on the first of July next, and as the loss of such a valuable and brave body of men will be of great injury to the service, I would submit it to the consideration of Congress, whether it would not be best to adopt some method to induce them to continue. They are indeed a very useful corps; but I need not mention this, as their importance is already well known to the Congress. It is necessary they should pay an early attention to this matter, as we know from past experience, that men are very slow in re-enlisting.</P>
<P>When I had the honor of seeing admiral Hopkins at New-London, he represented to me the weak state of his fleet, occa∣sioned by sickness and the damage he received in his engage∣ment
<PB N="106" REF="031423_0105_0FEC4B6AA4042B48"/>
with the enemy; and requested I would spare him two hun∣dred men to assist him in a design he had formed of attacking Wallace. This I readily consented to; and the men are to be returned as soon as the service is performed.</P>
<P>I wish it was in my power at present to furnish general Lee with the companies of artillery he desires.—I have already sent two companies to Quebec; and I have not yet been able to procure a return of those that are here. I expect colonel Knox every moment, and shall then be able to determine whether any can be spared from hence. Blankets we are in great want of, ourselves; and it was with great difficulty a few could be procured for the riflemen that were ordered for Canada.</P>
<P>I inclose you Mr. Winthrop's receipt for two hundred thousand dollars, brought some time ago from Philadelphia by major Sherburne, which you will please to deliver to the continental treasurers.</P>
<P>On my arrival here, I found that Mr. Livingston had been appointed by the provincial Congress, a commissary, to furnish the continental troops stationed in this city, with provisions. I suppose this was done because there was no continental com∣missary then on the spot. Mr. Livingston still claims a right of furnishing all the troops but those lately arrived from Cam∣bridge. Mr. Trumbull is now here: and, as I consider him as the principal in that office, I should be glad to know whether any part of the continental troops is to be furnished by any other than their commissary-general. I must needs say, that to me it appears very inconsistent, and must create great confu∣sion in the accounts as well as in the contracts.—I intended to have laid before Congress the amount of the rations, as supplied by colonel Trumbull and Mr. Livingston; and called upon those gentlemen to furnish me with a seperate estimate for that purpose. Colonel Trumbull has given me his, by which it ap∣pears he supplies the troops at eight pence and one-third per ration. I have not yet received any from Mr. Livingston; but am informed his contract is at ten pence half-penny. The dif∣ference is immense, as it will amount to no less than two hun∣dred pounds per day, for twenty thousand men. It is indeed to be considered that Mr. Livingston's contract is, including every other charge; and that to Mr. Trumbull's must be added store-hire, clerks, and every other contingent expence. But even then it will not amount to so much as Mr. Livingston's, by a penny per ration, which in the gross, will be something very considerable. I thought it my duty, without prejudice or partiality, to state the matter fairly to Congress, that they
<PB N="107" REF="031423_0106_0FEC4B73E07EF840"/>
might take such order upon it as to them shall seem necessary, I cannot, however, in justice to Mr. Trumbull, help adding that he has been indefatigable in supplying the army; and I believe, from his connections in New-England, is able to do it on as good terms as any person in America.</P>
<P>The several matters contained in the foregoing, I must beg the early attention of Congress to; and that I may be favored with an answer as soon as possible.</P>

<P>IN a letter which I had the honor to receive from Con∣gress some considerable time ago, they were pleased to ask what rank aids-de-camp bore in the army? from whence I conclud∣ed that they had adverted to the extraordinary trouble and con∣finement of those gentlemen, with a view to make them an ade∣quate allowance. But nothing being since done or said of the matter, I take the liberty,—unsolicited by, and unknown to my aids-de-camp,—to inform your honorable body that their pay is not by any means equal to their trouble and confinement.</P>
<P>No person wishes more to save money to the public, than I do: and no person has aimed more at it. But there are some cases in which parsimony may be ill placed; and this I take to be one. Aids-de-camp are persons in whom entire confidence must be placed: it requires men of abilities to execute the du∣ties with propriety and dispatch, where there is such a multi∣plicity of business, as must attend the commander-in-chief of such an army as ours: and persuaded I am, that nothing but the zeal of those gentlemen (who live with me, and act in this ca∣pacity) for the great American cause,—and personal attachment to me,—has induced them to undergo the trouble and confinement they have experienced since they have become members of my family.</P>
<P>I give into no kind of amusements myself; and consequently those about me can have none, but are confined from morning till eve, hearing and answering the applications and letters of one and another, which will now, I expect, receive a pretty considerable addition, as the business of the northern and east∣ern departments (if I continue here) must, I suppose, pass through my hands. If these gentlemen had the same relaxation from duty as other officers have in their common routine, there would not be so much in it. But, to have the mind always up∣on
<PB N="108" REF="031423_0107_0FEC4B786DC42FC0"/>
the stretch,—scarce ever unbent,—and no hours for recrea∣tion,—makes a material odds. Knowing this, and at the same time how inadequate the pay is, I can scarce find inclination to impose the necessary duties of their office upon them. To what I have here said, this further remark may be made, and is a matter of no small concernment to me, and, in its consequences, to the public:—and that is, that, while the duty is hard and the pay small, it is not to be wondered at, if there should be found a promptness in them to seek preferment, or in me to do justice to them by facilitating their views; by which means I must lose their aid when they have it most in their power to as∣sist me.—Influenced by these motives, I have taken the liberty of laying the matter fully, and with all due deference, before your honorable body, not doubting its meeting with a patient hearing.</P>

<P>THAT I might be in readiness to take the field in the spring, and prepared for any service Congress should think proper to send me upon, this campaign,—I desired colonel Reed, when he left Cambridge in the fall, to get me a set of camp equi∣page, tents, and baggage-waggons, made at Philadelphia under his own inspection, and sent to me. This, he informs me, is now done, and ready to come on.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received by last evening's post a letter from Joshua Wentworth, esquire, of Portsmouth, whom I had appointed agent for our little fleet in that province. It is dated the fif∣teenth instant; an extract from which I have the honor of tran∣scribing for your perusal.</P>
<P>"The third instant, commodore Manly brought in the bri∣gantine Elizabeth, one of the third division which sailed from Nantasket, with a valuable cargo of English goods, and a few
<PB N="109" REF="031423_0108_0FEC4B7A57DF4848"/>
hogsheads of rum and sugar, by a Mr. J * * *, who was a passenger, part freighter, and a very great tory. Suppose the cargo worth twenty thousand pounds sterling. Those goods are, the greatest part, owned by the inhabitants of Boston, and by some that were inhabitants when the troops left it,—the residue by this Mr. J * * *, and others of the same cast. The complicate state of this prize required my immediate setting off for Boston, expecting I might find some directions for my government there; when I waited on general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me his opinion (but not able to direct, having received no instructions to the point) that the vessel and cargo must be libelled, and a dividend to the captors would follow, of all such goods as might be legally claimed by the friends to America; and those that were the property of them inimical, might be decreed forfeited. Upon further inquiry, I was in∣formed a resolve passed in Congress that all vessels and goods, retaken previous to a condemnation by a British court of Ad∣miralty, were liable to a partial decree (by every colony judge) to the captors,—not more than one-third, nor less than one-fourth. The present prize falls under this resolve: and any other, that [<HI>makes the</HI>] property of our internal enemies liable to a full confiscation, may be necessary for my government: therefore shall be much obliged by your full direction of this capture, and a copy of the continental resolves thereon. This brigantine is owned by a Mr. Richard Hart of this town, taken on her return from the West-Indies last October and carried into Boston, not condemned. The rum on board are seventeen hogsheads,—and four of sugar, not removed out of her from the time of capture. The other cargo was in general stolen by virtue of general Howe's proclamation (which undoubtedly you have seen) appointing one C * * * B * * * superintendant, who, by the way, was taken in the prize, and is now confined in the Massachusetts colony, with Mr. J * * * and sundry others, by order of the general court, to whom general Ward delivered them.</P>
<P>"There were a serjeant and twelve privates of the fourth, or king's own regiment, taken prisoners on board, with the others, making sixty-three souls.</P>
<P>"There appeared from the pillage of this cargo by many of the passengers, the property was in him who could secret the most. For when examining the chests and bedding of the pri∣soners, I found great quantity of goods that they had collected while on board, which were taken out of ware houses without packing, and hove promiscuously on board the vessel. Even
<PB N="110" REF="031423_0109_0FEC4B7CB2C9ADB0"/>
the sailors had provided for their disposal at pleasure. In fact, the destruction of property under cover of general Howe's proclama∣tion, is unparalelled. * * *</P>
<P>"I am now discharging the cargo, as it is in a perishing si∣tuation; and, when selected, and the regular course pursued through the admiralty, shall advertise agreeable to his excellency's instructions to general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me an abstract.</P>
<P>"The general court of this province, finding a difficulty in ma∣king a code of laws for the admiralty court, did not complete that institution their last session, when they adjourned to June; which lapse of time will not admit my facilitating the disposal of the pri∣zes under my care, so early as I could wish, for the safety of part of the interest of the Susanna's cargo, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the porter, which I fear may be spoiled by lying so long,—it not having equal body to that commonly imported for sale;—which induces me to desire your direction for a disposal of that article either at pri∣vate or public sale."</P>
<P>That, sir, is an exact copy of part of Mr. Wentworth's letter to Mr. Moylan. I now request you will please to dirct me, in what manner I shall instruct the agent respecting the complicat∣ed cargo, and whether he may be empowered to dispose of the por∣ter or any other articles on board the prizes under his care, which the delay of establishing the court of admiralty may make liable to perish.</P>
<P>I have not yet heard that there has been any trial of the pri∣zes carried into Massachusetts bay. This procrastination is at∣tended with very bad consequences. Some of the vessels I had fitted out are now laid up, the crews being dissatisfied that they cannot get their prize-money. I have tired the Congress upon this subject: but the importance of it makes me again mention, that, if a summary way of proceeding is not resolved on, it will be impossible to get our vessels manned. I must also mention to you, sir, that captain Manly and his crew are desirous to know when they may expect their part of the value of the ord∣nance stores taken last fall. They are anxious to know what the amount may be. As the inventory of that cargo is in the hands of Congress, I would humbly submit it to them, whether a valuation therof should not be made, and the captors' dividend be remitted them as soon as possible. It will give them spirit, and encourage them to be alert in looking out for other prizes.</P>
<P>Several officers belonging to the regiments raised in these middle colonies inform me that their men (notwithstanding their agreement) begin to murmur at the distinction of pay made be∣tween
<PB N="111" REF="031423_0110_0FEC4B8132CB72D0"/>
them and the regiments from the eastward. I would be glad that the Congress would attend to this in time, lest it may get to such a pitch as will be difficult to suppress. They argue that they perform the same duty, undergo the same fatigue, and receive five dollars, when the eastern regiments receive six dol∣lars and two-thirds per month. For my own part, I wish they were all upon the same footing: for, if the British army will not face this way, it will be necessary to detach a great part of our troops: in that case, I would, for many reasons, be sorry there should be any distinctions of regiments that are all in the pay of the United Colonies.</P>
<P>The deficiency of arms (in the New-York regiments especially) is very great. If I am rightly informed, there are scarce as many in colonel Ritzema's regiment as will arm one compa∣ny.—Can the Congress remedy this evil? If they can, there should not a moment be lost in effecting it, as our strength at present is, in reality, on paper only. Should we think of dis∣charging those men who are without arms, the remedy would be worse than the disease: for, by vigorous exertions, I hope arms may be procured; and I well know that the raising men is ex∣ceeding difficult, especially to be engaged during the continuance of the war, which is the footing on which colonel Ritzema's regi∣ment is engaged.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 26.—I had wrote thus far before I was honored with your favor of the twenty-third instant. In obedience to the order therein contained, I have directed six regiments more for Canada, which will embark as soon as vessels and other ne∣cessaries can be provided. These regiments will be command∣ed by general Sullivan. I shall give him instructions to join the forces in that country under general Thomas, as soon as possible.</P>
<P>With respect to sending more troops to that country, I am really at a loss what to advise, as it is impossible at present to know the designs of the enemy. Should they send the whole force under general Howe up the river St. Laurence to relieve Quebec and re∣cover Canada, the troops gone and now going will be insufficient to stop their progress: and should they think proper to send that or an equal force this way from Great Britain for the purpose of pos∣sessing this city and securing the navigation of Hudson's river, the troops left here will not be sufficient to oppose them: and yet, for any thing we know, I think it not improbable they may attempt both,—both being of the greatest importance to them,—if they have men.</P>
<P>I could wish indeed that the army in Canada should be more
<PB N="112" REF="031423_0111_0FEC4B85AAA9D448"/>
powerfully reinforced: at the same time I am conscious that the trusting this important post (which is now become the grand magazine of America) to the handful of men remaining here, is running too great a risk. The securing this post and Hudson's river is to us also of so great importance, that I cannot at pre∣sent advise the sending any more troops from hence:—on the contrary, the general officers now here, whom I thought it my duty to consult, think it absolutely necessary to increase the ar∣my at this place with at least ten thousand men, especially when it is considered, that, from this place only, the army in Canada must draw its supplies of ammunition, provisions, and, most pro∣bably, of men; and that all reinforcements can be sent from hence much easier than from any other place. By the inclosed return, you will see the state of the army here, and that the number of effective men is far short of what the Congress must have expected.</P>
<P>I have found it necessary to order colonel Dayton's regiment from New-Jersey, to march as one of the six to Canada: where∣fore I must recommend it to Congress to order two companies of one of the regiments still in Pennsylvania to march to Cape-May, which can be done much sooner: for, had this destination of that regiment not taken place, it would have been very inconvenient to have detached two companies from it to that place; as the march would (according to lord Sterling's and other accounts) have been at least two hundred miles from Amboy, and they must have passed within twenty miles of Philadelphia, there being no practi∣cable road along the sea-coast of New-Jersey for their baggage to have passed.</P>
<P>Dr. Potts, who is bearer hereof, was, I understand, appoint∣ed director of the hospital for these middle colonies; but the army being removed, with the general hospital, from the east∣ward, does in course supercede him. He is inclined to go to Canada, where he may be very useful, if a person is not already appointed for that department.—I would humbly beg leave to ask the Congress whether, in all the appointments, it would not be best to have but one chief, to whom all the others should be sub∣ordinate.</P>

<P>I MEAN, through you, to do myself the honor of laying before Congress a copy of an address transmitted them some
<PB N="113" REF="031423_0112_0FEC4B8A11B35B58"/>
time ago by the assembly of Rhode-Island, which governor Cooke favored me with in the month of January, at the same time requesting me to interest myself in procuring a body of for∣ces on the continental establishment, for the defence of that colony. I doubt not but the address and the subject of it have had the attention and consideration of Congress before now. But if they have not decided upon the matter, I would beg leave to mention that I have made inquiry into the situation and condition of the colony, and find it to be as stated in the address; and, with all deference to the opinion of Congress, conceive it highly necessary and expedient that they should adopt some measures for relieving their distress, and granting the aid prayed for. The importance of it in the chain of the union,—its extensive sea-coast, affording harbors for our shipping and vessels, at the same time exposing and subjecting the inhabitants to the ravages and depredations of our enemies,—the zeal and attachment which it has shewn, and which still actuates it, to∣wards the common cause,—their incapacity to pay a sufficient number of men for its defence, should they be able to furnish them after so many engaged in other services;—these and many other reasons which are too obvious to be mentioned, plead power∣fully for the notice and attention of Congress, and seem to me to claim their support.</P>
<P>Having thus stated the matter to Congress for their consider∣ation, agreeable to my promise to governor Cooke when I had the honor of seeing him on my way here,—I shall leave it with them, not doubting but they will duly weigh its importance, and give such assistance as they may think reasonable and just.—What they chiefly wish for is that the troops they have raised may be taken into continental pay, and commanding officers ap∣pointed by Congress.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with your favor of the thirteenth ultimo, and observe what Congress have done respecting the settlement of the paymaster's accounts. This seems expedient, as he is out of office, and, I am certain, will be attended with but little if any difficulty; nothing more being necessary, than to com∣pare the warrants with his debts, and the receipts he has given, with his credits. I wish every other settlement as easy, and that a committee was appointed to examine and audit the ac∣counts
<PB N="114" REF="031423_0113_0FEC4B8E81E6D100"/>
upon which the warrants are founded, particularly those of the quarter-master and commissary-general's. They are long and of high amount, consisting of a variety of charges,—of course more intricate,—and will require time and an extraordinary de∣gree of attention to adjust and liquidate in a proper manner.—Up∣on this subject, I did myself the honor to write you a considerable time ago.</P>
<P>Having had several complaints from the officers in the east∣ern regiments, who have been, and are engaged in recruiting, about the expense attending it, and for which they have never yet been allowed any thing, though the officers in these go∣vernments have, as I am informed.—I shall be glad to know whether the allowance of ten shillings, granted to the officers for every man enlisted, by the resolve of Congress in [<HI>January</HI>], is general and indiscriminate, or confined to the middle districts. If general, must I have retrospect to the time of the resolves and pay for the services since, or only for future enlistments?</P>
<P>In a letter I wrote to Congress the twenty-fifth of December, I inclosed one I had received from Jacob Bailey, esquire, about opening a road from Newbury to Canada. I have received another of the fifteenth ultimo: and, from his account and the intelli∣gence I have from others upon enquiry, I have no doubt of the practicability of the measure; and am well informed that the distance will be considerably shortened, insomuch that our peo∣ple going from any part of the New-England governments eastward of Connecticut-river, to Canada, or returning from thence home, will perform their march in five or six days less time than by coming or going any way now used. Add to this, that the road may be so conducted (as it is said) as to go to the river Missisque, from whence the water carriage to St. John's is good, except forty odd miles,—or be carried so far to the northward as to keep clear of the lakes altogether, and afford an easy pass into Canada at all seasons. The advantage resulting from this route being so great and important, I have advanced colonel Bailey two hundred and fifty pounds to begin with, and directed him to exe∣cute his plan. No doubt it will require a considerable ad∣vance to accomplish it: but that will be soon sunk. The expense saved by taking off six days' pay and provisions from the soldiers returning to the eastern governments at the expiration of this cam∣paign, will be almost if not more than equal to the charge incurred in opening it. If not,—as in all probability there will be often a necessity for sending detachments of our troops to Canada from those governments, and for others to return, it will soon be repaid.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="031423_0114_0FEC4B90B7117150"/>
By a letter from general Schuyler, of the twenty-seventh ultimo, I find general Thompson and his brigade were at Albany; general Sullivan with the last (except three or four companies of colonel Wayne's regiment, not yet come) is embarked and gone, and pro∣bably will be soon there. I am apprehensive, from general Schuy∣ler's account, that they will not proceed with the wished for expe∣dition, owing to a difficulty in getting teams and provinder for cattle, necessary to carry their baggage, and a scarcity of bat∣teaux at the lakes for so large a number, though he is taking the utmost pains to procure them. Should they be stopped for any time, it will be exceedingly unfortunate, as their going from hence has weakened us here much, and our army in Canada will not be strengthened.</P>
<P>I have sent with the last brigade sixty barrels of powder, and o∣ther stores and intrenching tools, a supply being asked for; also the chain for a boom at the narrows of Richelieu, and the three boxes of money brought by Mr. Hanson; and have wrote to Mr. Schuy∣ler to have the boom fixed as soon as possible.—The commissary too has forwarded about eight hundred barrels of pork, and is in expectation of a further quantity from Connecticut, which will go on without stopping here.</P>
<P>As the magazine from whence the northern and eastern ar∣mies will occasionally receive supplies of powder will probably be here, and our stock is low and inconsiderable, being much reduced by the sixty barrels sent to Canada, I shall be glad to have a quantity immediately forwarded. Our stores should be great: for if the enemy make an attack upon the town, or at∣tempt to go up the North-river, the expenditure will be very con∣siderable. Money too is much wanted:—the regiments that are paid have only received to the first of April, except those of Pennsylvania and Jersey which are gone to Canada: they are paid to the last of April. By a letter from general Ward, I find his chest is just exhausted; the money which was left with him for the payment of the five regiments at Boston and Bever∣ly, being almost expended by large draughts in favor of the commissary and quarter-master, and in fitting out the armed vessels.</P>
<P>I would here ask a question, to wit, whether, as Mr. War∣ren's commission is superceded by Mr. Palfrey's appointment, it will not be necessary to fix upon some person to pay the troops there: or are the payments to go through his hands?—He does not incline to do any thing in the affair without the direction of Congress.</P>
<P>I have inclosed you a return of the last brigade detached, and
<PB N="116" REF="031423_0115_0FEC4B92DB1F8AE0"/>
also of the forces remaining here. And as it is a matter of much importance to know the whole of our strength from time to time, and to see it at one view, for regulating our movements with pro∣priety; I wish it were a direction from Congress to the command∣ing officers in the different districts to make monthly returns to the commander-in-chief of the continental army, and of the state of the troops in their departments, and also of the military stores. Such direction will probably make them more attentive than they other∣wise would be.—I could not get a return of the army in Canada all last year.</P>
<P>I beg leave to lay before Congress a copy of the proceedings of a court-martial upon lieutenant * * * * of the second regi∣ment, and of his defence,—which I should not have troubled them with, had I not conceived the court's sentence, upon the facts stated in the proceedings, of a singular nature, to be by no means adequate to the enormity of his offence, and to be of ex∣ceeding dangerous and pernicious tendency. Upon these prin∣ciples I thought it my duty to transmit the proceedings to them, in order that they may form such a judgment upon the facts stated, as they may conceive right and just, and advancive of the public good.—At the same time I would mention to Con∣gress that I think it of material consequence that they should pass a resolve, cutting off the right of succession in the military line from one rank to another, which is claimed by many upon the happening of vacancies,—(upon which principle this offence seems to have originated in a great measure, and the extraor∣dinary judgment in this instance to be founded)—declaring that no succession or promotion can take place upon any vacancy, without a continental commission giving and authorizing it. It is of much consequence to check and entirely suppress this opi∣nion and claim, which is becoming too prevalent, and has an obvious tendency to introduce mutiny and disorder;—or, if they conceive the claim good, and that it should take place, that they will declare it so, that the point may be settled and known in future.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE so often and so fully communicated my want o arms to Congress, that I should not have given them the trou∣ble of receiving another letter upon this subject at this time, but for the particular application of colonel Wayne of Pennsyl∣vania,
<PB N="117" REF="031423_0116_0FEC4B9507AAE018"/>
who has pointed out a method by which he thinks they may be obtained.</P>
<P>In the hands of the committee of safety at Philadelphia, there are, according to colonel Wayne's account, not less than two or three thousand stand of arms for provincial use. From hence he thinks a number might be borrowed by Congress, pro∣vided they are replaced with continental arms as they are brought into the magazine in that city. At a crisis so impor∣tant as this, such a loan might be attended with the most signal advantages,—while the defenceless state of the regiments, if no relief can be had, may be productive of fatal consequences.</P>
<P>To give Congress some idea of our situation with respect to arms—(and justice to my own character requires that it should be known to them, although the world at large will form their opinion of our strength from numbers, without attending to cir∣cumstances)—it may not be amiss to inclose a copy of a return which I received a few days ago from the forts in the High∣lands, and add, that, by a report from colonel Ritzema's re∣giment, of the twenty-ninth ultimo, there appeared to be only ninety-seven firelocks and seven bayonets belonging thereto: and that all the regiments from the eastward are deficient from twenty to fifty of the former. Four of those companies at the fortifications in the Highlands, belong to colonel Clinton's re∣giment; but in what condition the residue are on account of arms, and how colonel Wyncoop's men are provided, I cannot undertake to say, but am told, most miserably; as colonel Day∣ton's of New-Jersey, and colonel Wayne's of Pennsylvania also are. This, sir, is a true, though melancholy description of our situation. The propriety therefore of keeping arms in store when men in actual pay are in want of them, and who (it is to be presumed) will, as they ought, bear the heat and burden of the day, is submitted with all due deference to the superior judgment of others.</P>
<P>I cannot by all the enquiries I have been able to make, learn what number of arms have been taken from the tories, where they lie, or how they are to be got at. The committee of safety for this colony have assured me that no exertions of theirs shall be wanting to procure arms: but our sufferings in the mean time may prove fatal, as men without are in a man∣ner useless. I have therefore thoughts of employing an agent whose sole business it shall be to ride through the middle and interior parts of these governments, for the purpose of buying up such arms as the inhabitants may incline to sell, and are fit for use.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="031423_0117_0FEC4B97EFCF9FC0"/>
The designs of the enemy are too much behind the curtain for me to form any accurate opinion of their plan of operations for the summer's campaign. We are left to wander therefore in the field of conjecture: and as no place (all its consequences considered) seemed of more importance in the execution of their grand plan, than possessing themselves of Hudson's river, I thought it advisable to remove with the continental army to this city as soon as the king's troops evacuated Boston. But if Congress, from their knowledge, information, or belief, think it best for the general good of the service that I should go to the northward or elsewhere, they are convinced, I hope, that they have nothing more to do than signify their commands.</P>

<P>At a quarter after seven this evening, I received by ex∣press a letter from Thomas Cushing, esquire, chairman of a committee of the honorable general court, covering one to them for the committee of Salem; copies of which I do myself the honor to lay before Congress, that they may judge of the in∣telligence contained therein, and direct such measures to be taken upon the occasion as they may think proper and neces∣sary.</P>
<P>I would observe, that, supposing captain Lee's account to be true in part, I think there must be a mistake either in the number of troops or the transport ships. If there are no more ships than what are mentioned, it is certain there cannot be so many troops. Of this, however, Congress can judge as well as myself: and I submit to them, whether, upon the whole of the circumstances, and the uncertainty of their destination (if they were seen at all) they chuse that any forces shall be detached from hence, as they will see, from the returns transmitted yes∣terday, that the number of men now here is but small and in∣considerable; and (what is to be regretted) no small part of these without arms.—Perhaps, by dividing and subdividing our force too much, we shall have no one post sufficiently guar∣ded.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the fourth and seventh instant, with their several inclosures, and am exceedingly glad, that before the resolution respecting lieu∣tenant-colonel Ogden came to hand, I had ordered him to join his regiment, and had quelled a disagreeable spirit both of mutiny and desertion, which had taken place and seemed to be rising to a great degree in consequence of it. In order to effect it, I had the regiment paraded, and ordered two more at the same time under arms, convinced them of their error and ill conduct, and obtained a promise for their good behavior in future. To such of the men as had absconded I gave pardons, on their assurances to return to their duty again.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fifth instant which I had the honor of ad∣dressing you, I mentioned to Congress the refractory and muti∣nous conduct of lieutenant * * * * of the second regiment, and laid before them a copy of the proceedings of a court-martial upon him, and of his defence, with a view that such measures might be adopted as they should think adequate to his crime.—I would now beg leave to inform them, that, since then, he has appeared sensible of his misconduct and having made a writ∣ten acknowledgment of his offence, and begged pardon for it (as by the enclosed copy will appear), I thought it best to re∣lease him from his confinement, and have ordered him to join his regiment; which I hope will meet their approbation, and tender any determination, as to him, unnecessary;—observing at the same time that I have endeavored, and I flatter myself, not ineffectually, to support their authority, and a due subordination in the army, I have found it of importance and highly expedient to yield many points in fact, without seeming to have done it,—and this, to avoid bringing on a too frequent discussion of matters, which, in a political view, ought to be kept a little behind the curtain, and not be made too much the subjects of disquisition.—Time only can eradicate and overcome customs and prejudice of long standing: they must be got the better of, by slow and gra∣dual advances.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="031423_0119_0FEC4B9EB97A6E88"/>
I would here take occasion to suggest to Congress (not wish∣ing or meaning of myself to assume the smallest degree of power in any instance) the propriety and necessity of having their sen∣timents respecting the filling up the vacancies and issuing com∣missions to officers, especially to those under the rank of field officers. Had I literally complied with the directions given upon this subject when I first engaged in the service, and which I con∣ceived to be superceded by a subsequent resolve for forming the army upon the present establishment, I must have employed one clerk for no other business than issuing warrants of appointment, and giving information to Congress for their confirmation or re∣fusal. It being evident from the necessity of the thing, that there will be frequent changes and vacancies in office, from death and a variety of other causes, I now submit it to them, and pray their direction whether I am to pursue that mode and all the ceremonies attending it, or to be at liberty to fill up and grant commissions at once to such as may be sit and proper persons to succeed. * * *</P>
<P>Before I have done, with the utmost deference and respect I would beg leave to remind Congress of my former letters and applications respecting the appointment of proper persons to su∣perintend and take direction of such prisoners as have already fal∣len and will fall into our hands in the course of the war,—being fully convinced, that, if there were persons appointed who would take the whole management of them under their care, the con∣tinent would save a considerable sum of money by it, and the prisoners be better treated and provided with real necessaries than they now are;—and shall take the liberty to add that it appears to me a matter of much importance, and worthy of consideration, that particular and proper places of security should be fixed on and established in the interior parts of the different governments for their reception.</P>
<P>Such establishments are agreeable to the practice and usage of the English and other nations, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded on principles of necessity and public utility. The advantages which will a∣rise from them are obvious and many:—I shall only mention two or three.—They will tend much to prevent escapes (which are difficult to effect when the public is once advertised that the prisoners are restrained to a few stated and well-known places, and not permitted to go from thence), and the more ingenious among them from disseminating and spreading their artful and pernicious intrigues and opinions throughout the country, which would influence the weaker and wavering part of mankind, and meet with but too favorable a hearing. Further, it will be less
<PB N="121" REF="031423_0120_0FEC4BA9976DAA58"/>
in their power to join and assist our enemies in cases of invasion, and will give us an opportunity always to know, from the re∣turns of those appointed to superintend them, what number we have in possession, the force sufficient to check and suppress their hostile views in times of emergency, and the expences ne∣cessary for their maintenance and support. Many other reasons might be adduced to prove the necessity and expediency of the measure;—I shall only subjoin one more, and then have done on the subject,—which is, that many of the towns where pri∣soners have been already sent, not having convenience for or the means of keeping them, complain they are burdensome; and have become careless, inattentive, and altogether indiffer∣ent whether they escape or not; and those of them that are re∣stricted to a closer confinement (the limits of jail) are neglect∣ed, and not treated with that care and regard which Congress wish.</P>
<P>I have not received further intelligence of the German troops since my letter of the seventh instant, covering Mr. Cushing's dispatches. But, lest the account of their coming should be true, may it not be advisable and good policy to raise some companies of our Germans to send among them when they arrive, for exciting a spirit of disaffection and desertion?—If a few sensible and trusty fellows could get with them, I should think they would have great weight and influence with the common soldiery, who certainly have no enmity towards us, having received no injury nor cause of quarrel from us. The measure having occurred, and appearing to me expedient, I thought it prudent to mention it for the consideration Congress.</P>
<P>Having received a letter from general Ward, advising that Congress have accepted his resignation, and praying to be reliev∣ed,—and it being necessary that a general officer should be sent to take the command of the troops at Boston, especially if the army should arrive which is talked of, and which some consider as a probable event.—I must beg leave to recommend to Congress the appointment of some brigadier-generals, not having more here (nor so many at this time) than are essential to the government and conducting the forces and the works that are carrying on.—Generals Sullivan and Thompson being ordered to Canada, I can∣not spare one more general officer from hence without injuring the service greatly, and leaving the army here without a sufficient number.</P>
<P>Having frequent application from the committee of safety and others, about an exchange of prisoners, and not having au∣thority to pursue any other mode in this instance, than that
<PB N="122" REF="031423_0121_0FEC4BAB60EF88A8"/>
marked out by a resolve of Congress some considerable time ago, I hope they will pardon me when I wish them to take under con∣sideration such parts of my letter of the twenty-second ultimo as relate to this subject; and for their determination upon it. I shall then have it in my power to give explicit and satisfactory answers to those who shall apply.</P>

<P>SINCE my last of the eleventh instant, which I had the honor to address to you, nothing of moment or importance has occurred; and the principal design of this is to communicate to Congress the intelligence I received last night from general Schuyler by a letter of the tenth, respecting the progress of our troops in getting towards Canada, not doubting of their impatience and anxiety to hear of it and of every thing relating to the expedition. For their more particular information and satisfaction, I have done myself the pleasure to extract the sub∣stance of his letter on this head, which is as follows:—"that general Thompson, with the last of his brigade, on the morning of tuesday se'nnight, embarked at Fort-George; and, in the evening of the next day, general Sullivan arrived at Albany;—that he had ordered an additional number of carpenters to assist in building boats; who, finished eight every day, would have a hundred and ten complete by the twenty-first, before which he was fearful the last of general Sullivan's brigade could not embark;—that they would carry thirteen men each, besides the baggage, ammunition, and intrenching tools." * * *</P>
<P>He also informs, "That the sixty barrels of powder had ar∣rived, and would be forwarded that day; that the first regi∣ment of general Sullivan's brigade marched that morning; and that the intrenching tools and about six hundred barrels of pork were also gone on;—that he cannot possibly send more than half of the three hundred thousand dollars into Canada, (being greatly in debt on the public account, and the creditors exceedingly clamorous and importunate for payment), which sum he hopes will be sufficient, till the Canadians agree to take our paper currency, to which they are mnch averse, and of which he is exceedingly doubtful:—that he had got the chain, and would forward it that day to general Arnold, with orders to fix it at the rapids of Richelieu." He adds, "that he had
<PB N="123" REF="031423_0122_0FEC4BAD5BD5A410"/>
reviewed general Sullivan's brigade in presence of about two hundred and sixty Indians, who were greatly pleased with the order and regularity of the troops, and surprised at the number, which, the tories had industriously propagated, consisted only of three companies, and that they were always kept walking the streets, to induce them to believe their number was much greater than it really was."</P>
<P>I have enclosed a copy of general Schuyler's instructions to James Price, esquire, deputy commissary-general, for the regula∣tion of his conduct in that department, which I received last night, and which general Schuyler requested me to forward you.—I also beg leave to lay before Congress, a copy of a letter from Samuel Stringer, director of one of the hospitals, purport∣ing an application for an increase of surgeon's-mates, &amp;c. an estimate of which is also inclosed; and submit it to them, what number must be sent from hence or got elsewhere. It is highly probable that many more will be wanted in Canada than are already there, on account of the late augmention of the army: but I thought it most advisable to make his requisition known to Congress, and to take their order and direction upon it.—As to the medicines, I shall speak to Dr. Morgan (not yet arrived) as soon as he comes, and order him to forward such as may be necessary and can be possibly spared.</P>

<P>I THIS moment received by express from general Schuy∣ler an account of the melancholy prospect and reverse of our affairs in Canada; and presuming that the letters which accom∣pany this will give Congress full information upon the subject, I shall only add, that general Schuyler, in pursuance of orders from the honorable commissioners, has directed brigadier-general Sullivan to halt his brigade; as a further reinforcement (on ac∣count of the scarcity of provisions) would not relieve, but con∣tribute greatly to distress our troops already in Canada. Before he received these orders, all the brigade, except Dayton's and Wayne's regiments, had left Albany: but I suppose he will be able to stop their march.</P>
<P>By my letter of the fifteenth, Congress will perceive the quantity of pork already gone from hence: and the commissary has assured me that he will forward a further supply as soon as it can be possibly collected. I had also directed five tons of

<P>YOUR favor of the sixteenth, with several resolutions of Congress therein inclosed, I had not the honor to receive till last night. Before the receipt, I did not think myself at liberty to wait on Congress, although I wished to do it; and therefore, the more readily assented to general Gates's attendance, as I knew there were many matters which could be better explained in a personal interview than in whole volumes of letters. He accordingly set out for Philadelphia yesterday morning, and must have been too far advanced on his journey (as he proposed expedi∣tion) to be overtaken.</P>
<P>I shall, if I can settle some matters which are in agitation with the provincial Congress here, follow to-morrow or next day: and therefore, with every sentiment of regard, attach∣ment, and gratitude to Congress, for their kind attention to the means which they think may be conducive to my health, and with particular thanks to you for the politeness of your invi∣tation to your house, conclude, dear sir, your most obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honor to inform Congress that I arrived here yesterday afternoon about one o'clock, and found all in a state of peace and quiet. I had not time to view the works carry∣ing on, and those ordered to be begun when I went away; but have reason to believe, from the report of such of the ge∣neral and other officers as I had the pleasure to see, that they have been prosecuted and forwarded with all possible diligence and dispatch.</P>
<P>I am much concerned for the situation of our affairs in Canada, and am fearful, ere this, it is much worse than was first reported at Philadelphia. The intelligence from thence, in a letter from captain Wilkinson of the second regiment, to general Greene, is truly alarming. It not only confirms the account of colonel Bid∣dle and major Sherburne's defeat, but seems to forbode general Ar∣nold's, with the loss of Montreal.—I have inclosed a copy of the letter, which will but too well shew that there is foundation for my apprehensions.</P>
<P>On wednesday evening I received an express from general Schuyler, with sundry papers respecting sir John Johnston, which I have not time to copy, as the post is just going off, but will do myself the honor of transmitting you as soon as I possi∣bly can.</P>
<P>Before I left Philadelphia, I employed a person to superintend the building of the gondolas which Congress had resolved on for this this place. He is arrived, and all things seem to be in a proper channel for facilitating the work: but when they are done, we shall be much in want of guns, having never received any of those taken by commodore Hopkins.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of yesterday which I had the honor of ad∣dressing you, and which was designed to have gone by post, but was prevented by his departure at the usual time, I mentioned my having received by express a letter and sundry papers from general Schuyler, respecting sir John Johnston, copies of which I herewith transmit you for your inspection and perusal. They will shew you what measures were planned and attempted for apprehending him, and securing the Scotch Highlanders in Tryon county.</P>
<P>Having heard that the troops at Boston are extremely unea∣sy and almost mutinous for want of pay (several months being now due) I must take the liberty to repeat a question contain∣ed in my letter of the fifth ultimo,—"what mode is to be pur∣sued respecting it?" whether is money to be sent from hence by the paymaster-general, or some person subordinate to him to be appointed there for that purpose?—I expected some direction would have been given in this instance, long ere this, from what was contained in yours accompanying (or about the time of) the last remittance. I presume it has been omitted by reason of the multiplicity of important business before Con∣gress.</P>
<P>In perusing the several resolves you honored me with when at Philadelphia and since my return, I find one allowing a chief engineer for the army in a separate department. The service re∣quiring many of them, I wish Congress, if they know any per∣sons skilled in this business, would appoint them. General Schuy∣ler has frequently applied, and suggested the necessity of having some in Canada.—I myself know of none.</P>
<P>I also find there is a resolve of the third of June, for taking In∣dians into the service, which, if literally construed, confines them to that in Canada.—Is that the meaning of Congress, or that the commander-in-chief may order their service to any place he may think necessary?</P>
<P>In respect to the establishing expresses between the several continental posts,—who is to do it?—the resolves does not say.—Is it expected by Congress that I should?—Whoever the work is assigned to, I think should execute it with the utmost dispatch. The late imperfect and contradictory accounts re∣specting our defeat at the Cedars, strongly point out the ne∣cessity there is for it. No intelligence is yet come from any officer in command there (and most probably for want of a pro∣per
<PB N="128" REF="031423_0127_0FEC4BBBA27A7638"/>
channel to convey it,) though this misfortune happened so long ago.</P>
<P>When I had the honor of being in Congress, if I mistake not, I heard a resolve read, or was told of one, allowing the New∣York troops the same pay as others in the continental service.—This, if any such, I do not find; and if there is not such a one, I shall be under some embarrassment, how to pay the militia to be provided by this province. The resolve providing them, says they are to be paid, while in service, as other troops are. But if those enlisted heretofore in this province are to receive according to the first establishment, it is a matter of doubt, what the militia are to have.</P>
<P>Before this comes to hand, a hand-bill, containing an account of a victory gained by general Arnold over the party that had defeated colonel Biddle and major Sherburne, will most proba∣bly have reached you. I have inquired into the authenticity of this fortunate report, and have found there is no dependence to be put in it: nor do I believe it deserving of the least credit. I shall be happy not to hear the reverse.</P>

<P>P. S. If Congress have come to any resolution about an al∣lowance to induce men to re-enlist, you will please to favor me with it, as the time the rifle regiment is engaged for is just expired.</P>
<P>As the militia will be coming in, and they will be in much need of covering, please to have all the tents, and cloth proper, for making them that can be procured, forwarded as soon as possible.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored yesterday with your favor of the seventh, with its inclosures. When Dr. Potts arrives, I shall order him to Canada or Lake-George, as may appear most proper. It is certainly necessary that he or Dr. Stringer should go to the former.—The resolves respecting general Wooster's recall I will immediately transmit him with directions to repair hither without delay.</P>
<P>The situation of our affairs in Canada, as reported by the honorable commissioners, is truly alarming: and I am sorry that my opinion of the ill consequences resulting from the short enlistment of the army should be but too well confirmed by the experience they have had of the want of discipline and order
<PB N="129" REF="031423_0128_0FEC4BC25ED599B8"/>
in our soldiery there. This induces me again to wish Congress to determine on a liberal allowance to engage the troops already in service, to re-inlist for a longer period, or during the continu∣ance of the war; nor can I forbear expressing my opinion of the propriety of keeping the military chest always supplied with money, as evils of the most interesting nature are often produced for want of a regular payment of troops.—The neglect makes them impatient and uneasy.</P>
<P>I am much surprised at the scarcity of provisions there, parti∣cularly of flour; as, from several accounts I had received from thence, I was led to expect that considerable supplies of that article could be procured there. That our misfortunes may not become greater, I have wrote to the commissary to forward more provisions, in addition to those already sent.</P>
<P>An adjutant and quarter-master-general are indispensably ne∣cessary, with assistants. The money saved to the continent by their non-appointment will be but small and trifling, when put in competition with the loss for want of them. Colonel Fleming who acted in the former capacity under general Mont∣gomery, is now here: but his indisposition is such as to render him unfit, at this time, for the post:—it is an important one, and requires vigor and activity to discharge the duties of it. He will be of much service to colonel Reed, the business of whose office will increase considerably by the augmentation of the army.</P>
<P>It will be necessary, too, that the commissaries in Canada, and the deputy quarter-master-generals, should have several assistants and clerks: nor do I think a precise number can be fixed on, as a variety of circumstances may and must occur, to render the number, essential for doing the business in those departments, greater or less at different times. It will be better, I apprehend, to leave it indefinite, and with power to the commanding officer to allow such as may be wanted.</P>
<P>I am still in the dark, how the unfortunate affair ended at the Cedars, or on what terms the surrender was made, as the last let∣ter from the commissioners has reference to a former, and mentions an agreement entered into, which I have not seen: but I know of it more than I could wish.</P>
<P>I have received from Providence, in consequence of Mr. Mor∣ris's order, as chairman of the secret committee of Congress, two hundred and thirty-four muskets, in part of the two hundred and forty-four directed to be sent. The inclosed copy of a letter from Mr. Brown, will account for the deficiency.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="031423_0129_0FEC4BC4D5355A10"/>
I shall be much obliged by your ordering a quantity of lead and flints to be immediately forwarded; our demands for both are and will be very pressing. There are also wanted some particular and necessary medicines to complete our hospital chests, of which I will get Dr. Morgan to furnish Congress with a list, when he writes or waits on them about some other matters necessary to be fixed in his department.</P>
<P>As general Wooster in all probability, will be here in a little time, in compliance with the resolve of Congress and my order transmitted to him, I wish to know what I am to do with him when he comes.</P>
<P>General Schuyler in his letter of the thirty-first ultimo, of which I transmitted you a copy yesterday, mentions that sundry persons had a design to seize him as a tory, and probably still have; and wishes Congress to give him some public mark of their approbation, if they are convinced of his zeal and attachment to the cause of his country.—Whether he intended that I should communicate his desire to them, or not, I am not certain; but, supposing that he did, I must beg leave to request that you will lay the paragraph before them, that they may do, in the in∣stance of his requisition, whatever they may judge necessary.—</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I did myself the honor of writing to you yester∣day, I have had the satisfaction of seeing, and for a few minutes conversing with, Mr. Chase and Mr. Carroll from Canada.—Their account of our troops and the situation of affairs in that department cannot possibly surprise you more than it has done me. But I need not touch upon a subject which you will be so well informed of from the fountain-head; nor should I have given you the trouble of a letter by this day's post, but for the distraction which seems to prevail in the commissary's depart∣ment, as well as others in that quarter,—the necessity of having it under one general direction,—and the dissatisfaction of colo∣nel Trumbull at the allowance made him by Congress as an
<PB N="131" REF="031423_0130_0FEC4BC9381F2C18"/>
equivalent for his trouble. With respect to this particular matter, I can only say that I think he is a man well [<HI>calculated</HI>] for the business, and that, where a shilling is saved in the pay, a pound may be lost by mismanagement in the off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce; and that his resig∣nation at this time (I mean this campaign) may possibly be atten∣ded with fatal consequences. I therefore humbly submit to Con∣gress the propriety of handsomely rewarding those gentlemen who hold such very important, troublesome, and hazardous offices, as commissary and quarter-master.</P>
<P>In speaking to the former about the supplies necessary for the troops to be raised, he informed me that the quantity of salt pro∣visions which was shipping from hence, might render his attempts to do it precarious; in consequence of which, I desired him to lay the matter before the convention of this colony, which he will do this day, but in the mean while desired Congress might be in∣formed of the matter, which I cannot better do than his own words inclosed, and submit the consideration of it to the wisdom of that honorable body.</P>
<P>To Congress I also submit the propriety of keeping the two continental battalions (under the command of colonels Shee and M'Gaw) at Philadelphia, when there is the greatest pro∣bability of a speedy attack upon this place, from the king's troops. The encouragements given by governor Tryon to the disaffected, which are circulated, no one can well tell how,—the movements of these kind of people, which are more easy to perceive than describe,—the confident report, which is said to have come immediately from governor Tryon, and brought by a frigate from Halifax, that the troops at that place are em∣barking for this,—added to a thousand incidental circumstances, trivial in themselves, but strong from comparison,—leaves not a doubt upon my mind but that troops are hourly expected at the Hook.</P>
<P>I had no doubt, when I left this city for Philadelphia, but that some measures would have been taken to secure the sus∣pected and dangerous persons of this government before now, and left orders for the military to give every aid to the civil power. But the subject is delicate, and nothing is done in it. We may therefore have internal as well as external enemies to contend with.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honor of transmitting to Congress a letter which came by express last night from general Schuyler, inclos∣ing a copy of a letter to him from colonel Kirkland. I have likewise inclosed the copy of one directed to general Putnam or the commanding officer at New-York. The representations contained in these letters have induced me, without waiting the determination of Congress, to direct general Schuyler immediate∣ly to commence a treaty with the Six Nations, and to engage them in our interest, upon the best terms he and his colleagues in com∣mission can procure; and I trust the urgency of the occasion will justify my proceedings to the Congress:—the necessity for decisi∣on and dispatch in all our measures, in my opinion, becomes every day more and more apparent.</P>
<P>The express, Mr. Bennet, was overtaken at Albany by ge∣neral Schuyler, who had received intelligence at Fort-George that a considerable body of Mohawk Indians were coming down the Mohawk river under the conduct of sir John John∣ston. The general's extreme hurry would not allow him to write: but it seems his intention is to collect at Albany a suffi∣cient force to oppose sir John. I have given him my opinion that colonel Dayton's regiment should be employed in that ser∣vice, and to secure the post where Fort-Stanwix formerly stood.</P>
<P>In consequence of an information that several merchants were exporting salt pork and beef from this place, I requested the commissary to make application to the provincial Congress for a restraint to be laid on the exportation of those articles, as I apprehended, not only that the enemy might receive supplies by the capture of our vessels, but that our people might shortly experience a scarcity. The provincial Congress have accord∣ingly made a resolution (a copy of which is inclosed) to stop the exportation for fourteen days. They expect Congress will in the mean time frame some general regulations on this head. They are unwilling (they say) to subject their constituents to par∣tial restraints.</P>
<P>I once mentioned to Congress that I thought a war-office, ex∣tremely necessary; and they seemed inclined to institute one for our army: but the affair seems to be since dropped. Give me leave again to insist on the utility and importance of such and estab∣lishment. The more I reflect upon the subject, the more I am convinced of its necessity, and that affairs can never be proper∣ly conducted without it.</P>

'Tis with pleasure I receive the resolve inclosed in your favor of the eleventh instant. One considerable ground of disaffection in in the army is thereby removed.</P>

<P>I Herewith transmit you copies of a letter from general Schuyler and its several inclosures, which I received since I had the honor of addressing you yesterday. From these you will learn that general Thomas died the second instant; and the apprehensi∣ons of our frontier friends in this colony, that our savage foes are meditating an attack against them.</P>
<P>I must beg leave to refer you to a paragraph in the copy of general Schuyler's letter to general Putnam or the command∣ing officers here, inclosed in mine of the thirteenth, where he requests a supply of cloathing to be sent for the army in Canada. As there is but little or no probability of getting it here, I shall be glad to know whether there will be any chance of pro∣curing it in Philadelphia; and, if it should be sent through the hands of the quarter-master here, to what account it is to be charged.</P>
<P>I was last evening favored with yours of the eleventh instant, and hope the two battalions, which Congress have ordered from Philadelphia for the defence of this place, will come provid∣ed with arms. If they do not, they will be of no service, as there are more troops here already than are armed.</P>
<P>From general Schuyler's letter, he has in view the taking post where Fort-Stanwix formerly stood. I wrote him, I thought it prudent, previous to that, to secure a post lower down, about the falls below the German-Flats, lest the sava∣ges should possess themselves of the country, and prevent sup∣plies of men and provisions that may be necessary to send there in future. He says he is in want of cannon and ammunition; but has expressed himself so ambiguously, that I am at a loss to know whether he meant what he has said as an application or not,—this being the only intelligence on the subject, and the first mention of his want. I have desired him to explain the
<PB N="134" REF="031423_0133_0FEC4BCF60B52758"/>

<P>I DO myself the honor to transmit to Congress a copy of a letter covering copies of other papers, which I received yes∣terday evening from general Sullivan. The intelligence com∣municated by him is pleasing and interesting, and such as must afford the greatest satisfaction, if the conduct the Canadians have discovered since his arrival among them is ingenious and sincere.</P>
<P>General Sullivan mentions his having given commissions to some of the Canadians as a measure founded in necessity, and requests my approbation of it. But not considering myself em∣powered to say any thing upon the subject, it may not be im∣proper for Congress to give him their opinion in this instance.</P>
<P>I have also inclosed copies of General Schuyler's letters re∣ceived at the same time. They contain accounts respecting the Indians, variant from what was reported by Mr. Kirkland, but amounting to the same thing,—the probability of the savages at∣tacking our frontiers.</P>
<P>By last night's post I had information of a capture made by our armed vessels, of one of the transports with a company of High∣landers on board, bound to Boston. The inclosed extract from general Ward's letter to me will give you the intelligence more particularly.—There are accounts in the city, mentioning other valuable prizes: but as general Ward has said nothing of them, I fear they want authenticity.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention that a further sum of money will be wanted for our military chest by the time it can be sent. The in∣closed note from the paymaster-general shews the necessity for it; and, I may add, besides his estimates of draughts to be made, there are the claims of the eastern troops at Boston, for three or four month's pay, not included, and now due.</P>

<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the fourteenth and eighteenth instant, and the interesting resolves con∣tained in them, with which I have been honored. The several matters recommended to my attention shall be particularly regard∣ed, and the directions of Congress and your requests complied with in every instance, as far as in my power.</P>
<P>The instituting a war-office is certainly an event of great im∣portance, and, in all probability, will be recorded as such in the historic page. The benefits derived from it, I flatter myself, will be considerable, though the plan upon which it is first formed may not be entirely perfect. This, like other great works, in its first edition, may not be free from error:—time will discover its defects, and experience suggest the remedy, and such further improvements as may be necessary; but it was right to give it a beginning, in my opinion.</P>
<P>The recommendation to the convention of New-York for re∣straining and punishing disaffected persons, I am hopeful, will be attended with salutary consequences; and the prohibition against exporting provisions appears to have been a measure founded in sound policy, lest proper supplies should be wanted, wherewith to supply our armies.</P>
<P>I have transmitted general Schuyler the resolves about the
<PB N="136" REF="031423_0135_0FEC4BD5B0C2BA20"/>
Indians, and the others on which he is to act; and have requested his strict attention and exertions in order to their being carried in∣to execution with all possible dispatch.</P>
<P>I note your request respecting Mr. Hancock. He shall have such directions as may be necessary for conducting his office; and I am happy he will have so early a remittance for paying the troops in his department.</P>
<P>The silver and paper money designed for Canada will be highly serviceable, and I hope will be the means of re-esta∣blishing our credit there in some degree with the Canadians, and also encourage our men too, who have complained in this instance. When it arrives, I will send it forward under a proper guard.</P>
<P>I have communicated to major-general Gates the resolve of Congress for him to prepare to Canada, and directed him to view Point-au-fer, that a fortress may be erected if he shall judge ne∣cessary. He is preparing for his command, and in a few days will take his departure for it. I would fain hope his arrival there will give our affairs a complection different from what they have worn for a long time past, and that many essential benefits will result from it.</P>
<P>The kind attention Congress have shewn to afford the com∣mander-in-chief here every assistance, by resolving that recom∣mendatory letters be written to the conventions of New-Jersey, New-York, and assembly of Connecticut, to authorise him to call in the militia in case of exigency, claims my thankful acknow∣ledgments; and, I trust, if carried into execution, will produce many advantages in case it may be expedient at any time to call in early reinforcements. The delays incident to the ordinary mode may frequently render their aid too late, and prove exceedingly injurious.</P>
<P>I this evening received intelligence of the nineteenth instant from captain Pond of the armed sloop Schuyler, of his having taken, about fifty miles from this, on the south side of Long-Island, a ship and a sloop bound to Sandy-Hook. The ship from Glasgow, with a company of the forty-second regiment, had been taken by one of commodore Hopkins's fleet, who took the soldiers out, and ordered her to Rhode-Island; after which, she was retaken by the Cerberus, and put under the convoy of the sloop. As captain Pond informs me, there were five commissioned officers, two ladies, and four privates on board. They are not yet arrived at head-quarters.—Inclosed is an invoice of what they have on board.</P>
<P>General Wooster having expressed an inclination and wish to
<PB N="137" REF="031423_0136_0FEC4BD7864A3EA8"/>
wait on Congress, I have given him permission, not having any occasion for him here. He set out this morning.</P>
<P>I have been up to view the grounds about Kingsbridge, and find them to admit of several places well calculated for de∣fence; and, esteeming it a pass of the utmost importance, have ordered works to be laid out, and shall direct part of the two battalions from Pennsylvania to set about the execution imme∣diately, and will add to their number several of the milita when they come in, to expedite them with all possible dispatch.</P>
<P>Their consequence, as they will keep open the communica∣tion with the country, requires the most speedy completion of them.</P>

I shall ap∣point a deputy muster-master-general as soon as I can fix on a proper person for the office, and direct him immediately to re∣pair to Canada.</P>
<P>Mr. Bennet, the bearer of this, delivered me a letter to-day from general Schuyler, inclosing the proceedings of the commis∣sioners of Indian affairs, at a meeting at Albany, in consequence of the resolution of Congress (as they say) which I trans∣mitted, the seventh instant, for engaging the Indians in our service. The gentlemen appear to me to have widely mistaken the views of Congress in this instance, and to have formed a plan for engaging such Indians as were not in contemplation.—I cannot account upon what principle they have gone, as a part of their proceedings shews they are about to hold a conference with the Six Nations. I suppose they esteemed what they have done, a necessary measure;—a copy of which I have the honor to inclose you.</P>
<P>I shall now beg leave to lay before Congress a preposition made to me by captain Leary of this city, in behalf of a body of men who are desirous of being employed in the continental service, as a troop of horse, and at the same time to offer my opinion that such a corps may be extremely useful in many re∣spects. In a march, they may be of the utmost service in re∣connoitring the enemy and gaining intelligence, and have it in their power to render many important benefits. The terms on
<PB N="138" REF="031423_0137_0FEC59D75EBB89D8"/>
which they are willing to engage are inclosed, which appear to me moderate and reasonable.—I am also informed that another company might readily be made up, and most probably upon the same terms. I would therefore submit the propriety and expediency of the measure to the consideration of Congress, and wish their opinion whether it will be agreeable to them that both or either of them should be formed and incorporated in this army, in manner as has been proposed by captain Leary, if it can be done.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered to you by the chevalier de Kirmo∣van and monsieur de Vermonet. They are French gentlemen just arrived in this place, who have made application to me to be received into the continental service. They bring letters to Dr. Franklin and some other gentlemen of the Congress. I suppose it will better appear from those letters, than from any information I can give, whether it will be proper to employ them in the capacity they are desirous of.</P>

<P>I Herewith transmit you an extract of a letter from general Ward, which came to hand by last night's post, containing the agreeable intelligence of their having obliged the king's ships to leave Nantasket road, and of two transports more being taken by our armed vessels, with two hundred and ten Highland troops on board.</P>
<P>I sincerely wish the same success had attended our arms in another quarter:—but it has not. In Canada, the situation of our affairs is truly alarming. The inclosed copies of generals Schuyler, Sullivan, and Arnold's letters will inform you that general Thompson has met with a repulse at Three Rivers, and is now a prisoner in the hands of general Burgoyne, who (these accounts say) is arrived with a considerable army. Nor do they seem to promise an end of our misfortunes here:—it is greatly to be feared that the next advices from thence will be, that our shattered, divided and broken army (as you will see by the return) have been obliged to abandon the country, and retreat,
<PB N="139" REF="031423_0138_0FEC59DB02D5F7A8"/>
to avoid a greater calamity,—that of being cut off or becoming prisoners.—I will have done upon the subject, and leave you to draw such conclusions as you conceive, from the state of facts, are most likely to result: only adding my apprehensions that one of the latter events,—either that they are cut off, or become prisoners,—has already happened, if they did not retreat while they had an opportunity. General Schuyler and general Arnold seem to think it extremely probable; and if it has taken place, it will not be easy to describe all the fatal consequences that may flow from it. At least our utmost exertions will be necessary, to prevent the advantages they have gained being turned to our greater misfortunes.—General Gates will certainly set out to∣morrow, and would have gone before now, had he not ex∣pected to receive some particular instructions from Congress, which colonel Braxton said he imagined would be given and transmitted here.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a copy of a letter from general Arnold, respecting some of the Indian tribes, to general Schuyler, and of a talk had at Albany, with thirteen of the Oneidas. They seemed then to entertain a friendly disposition towards us, which I wish may not be changed by the misfortunes we have sustained in Ca∣nada.</P>

<P>I THIS morning received by express, letters from generals Schuyler and Arnold, with a copy of one to general Sullivan from the former, and also of others to general Sullivan; of all which I do myself the honor to transmit you copies▪ They will give you a further account of the melancholy situation of our af∣fairs in Canada, and shew that there is nothing left to save our ar∣my there but evacuating the country.</P>
<P>I am hopeful general Sullivan would retreat from Isle-aux∣noix without waiting for previous orders for that purpose; as from general Schuyler's and Arnold's letters, it is much to be feared, by remaining there any considerable time, his retreat would be cut off, or at least be a matter of extreme difficulty. I would observe to Congress that it is not in my power to send any carpenters from hence to build the gondolas and gallies general Arnold mentions, without taking them from a work equally necessary (if not more so) here, of the same kind:—and submit it to them whether it may not be advisable (as it is
<PB N="140" REF="031423_0139_0FEC59E005068F60"/>
of great importance to us to have a number of those vessels on the lake, to prevent the enemy's passing) to withdraw the car∣penters for the present from the frigates building up the North river, and detach them immediately, with all that can be got at Philadelphia, for that purpose and carrying on those here.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to inform you of another capture made by our armed vessels, of a transport, on the nineteenth instant, with a company of Highland grenadiers on board. The in∣closed extract of a letter from general Ward, by last night's post, contains the particulars; to which I beg leave to refer you.</P>
<P>I have been honored with your favors of the twenty-first and twenty-fifth instant in due order, with their important inclosures, to which I shall particularly attend.—I have transmitted general Schuyler a copy of the resolve of Congress respecting the Mo∣hickan and Stockbridge Indians, and directed him to put an im∣mediate stop to the raising the two companies.</P>
<P>The quarter-master-general has been called upon for stopping the tents designed for Massachusetts-Bay, and ordered to forward them immediately. He means to write to Congress upon the subject, and hopes his conduct will not appear to deserve their reprehension. Of this they will judge from his relation of the matter.</P>
<P>Being extremely desirous to forward the intelligence from Ca∣nada to Congress, well knowing their anxiety about our affairs there, I must defer writing upon some other matters, I want to lay before them, until the next opportunity, which I hope will be to-morrow, when I will inform them fully upon the subject of ra∣tions, having desired the commissary-general to furnish me with some things necessary in that instance.</P>

<P>UPON information that major * * * was travelling through the country under suspicious circumstances, I thought it necessary to have him secured, I therefore sent after him, he was taken at South-Amboy, and brought up to New-York. Up∣on examination he informed me that he came from New-Hamp∣shire, the country of his usual abode, where he had left his fa∣mily; and pretended he was destined to Philadelphia on business with Congress.</P>
<P>As by his own confession he had crossed Hudson's-river at
<PB N="141" REF="031423_0140_0FEC59E39CC53048"/>
New-Windsor, and was taken so far out of his proper and direct route to Philadelphia, this consideration added to the length of time he had taken to perform his journey,—his being found in so suspicious a place as Amboy,—his unnecessary stay there on pre∣tence of getting some baggage from New-York, and an expectation of receiving money from a person here, of bad character, and in no circumstances to furnish him out of his own stock,—the major's re∣putation, and his being a half pay officer,—have increased my jealousies about him.</P>
<P>The business, which he informs me he has with Congress, is a secret offer of his services, to the end that, in case it should be rejected, he might have his way left open to an employment in the East Indies, to which he is assigned: and in that case he flatters himself he will obtain leave of Congress to go to Great-Britain.</P>
<P>As he had be en put upon his parole by Congress, I thought it would be improper to stay his progress to Philadelphia, should he be infact destined thither. I therefore send him forward, but (to prevent imposition) under the care of an officer, with letters found upon him, which, from their tenor, seem calculated to recom∣mend him to Congress.—I submit it to their consideration, whether it would not be dangerous to accept of the offer of his service.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance of the request of Congress contained in your favor of the twenty-fifth instant, and my promise of yesterday, I do myself the honor to inform you the cost of a ration, according to the commissary-general's estimate, from the first of July to the first of December, will be from eight-pence to eight-pence half penny, York currency.</P>
<P>Having discharged the obligation I was under in this in∣stance, and finding that many applications have been made for victualling the flying camp, I would, with all possible defer∣ence, wish Congress to consider, the matter well before they come to any determination upon it. Who the gentlemen are that have made offers upon this occasion, I know not: conse∣quently my objection to their appointment cannot proceed from personal dislike; nor have I it in view to serve Mr. Trumbull the commissary-general, by wishing him to have the direction of the whole supplies for his emolument: because
<PB N="142" REF="031423_0141_0FEC59E52770B9B8"/>
whatever rations are taken from him save him the trouble of supplying provisions to the amount, without diminishing his pay,—that being fixed and certain:—but what influences me is a regard to the public good. I am morally certain, if the bu∣siness is taken out of Mr. Trumbull's hands and put into ano∣ther's, that it may, and will in all probability, be attended with great and many inconveniencies. It is likely, during the conti∣nuance of the war between us and Great Britain, that the army here, or part of it, and the troops composing the flying camp, will be frequently joined, and under the necessity of affording each other mutual aid. If this event is probable (and most certainly it is), the same confusion and disorder will result from having two commissaries, or one commissary and one contractor in the same army in the same department, as did between Mr. Trumbull and Mr. Livingston on the coming of the former to New-York. I cannot discriminate the two cases; and not foreseeing that any good consequences will flow from the mea∣sure, but that many bad ones will,—such as clashing of inter∣ests,—a contention for stores, carriages,—and many other causes that might be mentioned if hurry of business would permit,—I confess I cannot perceive the propriety of appointing a different person, or any but the commissary.</P>
<P>I would also add, that few armies, if any, have been better supplied than the troops under Mr. Trumbull's care in this instance; which, I should suppose, ought to have considerable weight, especially as we have strong reasons to believe that a large share of the misfortunes our arms have sustained in Cana∣da, sprang from a want of proper and necessary supplies of pro∣visions.</P>
<P>Mr. Trumbull too (I am informed) has already made provi∣sion in New-Jersey for the flying camp which will be stationed there, and employed proper persons in that colony to transact the business incident to his department, in obedience to my orders, and in full confidence that it was to come under his ma∣nagement.</P>
<P>My great desire to see the affairs of this important post, on which so much depends, go on in an easy, smooth and unin∣terrupted course, has led me to say thus much upon the subject, and will, I hope (if I am unhappy enough to differ in opinion with Congress), plead my excuse for the liberty I have taken.</P>
<P>I would also beg leave to mention to congress the necessity there is of some new regulations being entered into, respecting the chaplains of this army. They will remember that appli∣cations were made to increase their pay, which was conceived
<PB N="143" REF="031423_0142_0FEC59E6B5868B90"/>
too low for their support; and that it was proposed (if it could not be done for the whole) that the number should be lessened, and one be appointed to two regiments, with an additional al∣lowance. This latter expedient was adopted, and, while the army continued all together at one encampment, answered well, or at least did not produce many inconveniences. But the ar∣my now being differently circumstanced from what it then was,—part here, part at Boston, and a third part detached to Ca∣nada,—has introduced much confusion and disorder in this in∣stance; nor do I know how it is possible to remedy the evil, but by affixing one to each regiment, with salaries competent to their support. No shifting, no change from one regiment to another can answer the purpose; and in many cases it could never be done though the regiments should consent,—as where detachments are composed of unequal numbers, or ordered from different posts. Many more inconveniencies might be pointed out: but these, it is presumed, will sufficiently shew the defect of the present establishment, and the propriety of an alteration. What that alteration shall be, Congress will please to determine.</P>
<P>Congress, I doubt not, will have heard of the plot, that was forming among many disaffected persons in this city and govern∣ment for aiding the king's troops upon their arrival. No regu∣lar plan seems to have been digested; but several persons have been enlisted, and sworn to join them. The matter, I am in hopes, by a timely discovery, will be suppressed and put a stop to. Many citizens and others, among whom is the mayor, are now in confinement. The matter has been traced up to governor Tryon; and the mayor appears to have been a principal agent, or go-between him and the persons concerned in it. The plot has been communicated to some of the army, and part of my guard engaged in it. T * * * H * * *, one of them, has been tried, and, by the unanimous opinion of a court-martial, is sentenced to die,—having enlisted himself, and engaged others. The sentence, by the advice of the whole council of general officers, will be put in execution to-day at eleven o'clock. The others are not tried, I am hopeful this example will produce ma∣ny salutary consequences, and deter others from entering into the like traitorous practices.</P>
<P>The enclosed copy of a resolve of the provincial Congress will shew that some of the diaffected on Long-Island have taken up arms.—I have, agreeable to their request, sent a party after them, but have not as yet been able to apprehend
<PB N="144" REF="031423_0143_0FEC59E84F6DE7C8"/>
them,—having concealed themselves in different woods and mo∣rasses.</P>
<P>General Gates set out on tuesday with a fine wind, which has been fair ever since, and would soon arrive at Albany.</P>
<P>I this moment received a letter from lieutenant Davison, of the Schuyler armed sloop, a copy of which I have inclosed; to which I beg leave to refer you for the intelligence communicated by him.</P>
<P>I could wish general Howe and his armament not to arrive yet, as not more than a thousand militia have yet come in, and our whole force, (including the troops at all the detached posts, and on board the armed vessels, which are comprehended in our returns) is but small and inconsiderable, when compared with the exten∣sive lines they are to defend, and (most probably) the army that he brings. I have no further intelligence about him than what the lieutenant mentions: but it is extremely probable his accounts and conjectures are true.</P>

<P>P. S. I have inclosed a general return:—and it may be cer∣tainly depended on, that general Howe and fleet have failed from Halifax. Some of the men, on board the prizes mentioned in the lieutenant's letter, were on board the Greyhound, and saw gene∣ral Howe.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS last night honored with your favor of the twenty-sixth instant, and, agreeable to your request, shall pay proper atten∣tion to the resolves it inclosed.</P>
<P>I observe the augmentation Congress have resolved to make to the forces destined to the northern department, and the bounty be allowed such soldiers as will enlist for three years. I hope many good consequences will result from these measures; and that, from the latter, a considerable number of men may be induced to engage in the service.</P>
<P>I should esteem myself extremely happy to afford the least assistance to the Canada department in compliance with the de∣sire of Congress and your requisition, were it in my power: but it is not. The return which I transmitted yesterday will but too well convince Congress of my incapacity in this instance, and point out to them that the force I now have is trifling, considering the many and important posts that are necessary, and must be supported, if possible. But few militia have yet
<PB N="145" REF="031423_0144_0FEC59EEB3D2C110"/>
come in, the whole being about twelve hundred, including the two battalions of this city, and one company from the Jerseys. I wish the delay may not be attended with disagreeable consequen∣ces, and their aid may not come too late, or when it may not be wanted. I have wrote,—I have done every thing I could, to call them in: but they have not come, though I am told that they are generally willing.</P>
<P>The accounts communicated yesterday through lieutenant Da∣vison's letter are partly confirmed, and, I dare say, will turn out to be true on the whole. For two or three days past, three or four ships have been dropping in; and I just now received an express from an officer appointed to keep a look-out on Staten-Island, that forty-five arrived at the Hook to-day:—some say more;—and I suppose the whole fleet will be in, within a day or two. I am hopeful, before they are prepared to attack, that I shall get some reinforcements.—Be this as it may, I shall at∣tempt to make the best disposition I can of the troops, in order to give them a proper reception, and to prevent the ruin and destruc∣tion they are meditating against us.</P>
<P>As soon as the express arrived last night, I sent the letters for the northern colonies, to the quarter-master-general, with orders to forward them immediately.</P>
<P>When monsieur Wiebert comes—(I have not seen him yet)—I shall employ him as Congress have directed. The terms upon which he offers his service seem to promise something from him. I wish he may answer, and be skilled in the business he says he is acquainted with.</P>

<P>I HAD the pleasure of receiving your favor of the twenty-ninth, early this morning, with which you have been pleased to honor me, together with the resolves for a further augmentation of the army.</P>
<P>The battalions of Germans, which Congress have ordered to be raised, will be a corps of much service: and I am hopeful that such persons will be appointed officers, as will complete their en∣listments with all possible expedition.</P>
<P>I shall communicate to colonel Sterenson and one of his field-officers what you have requested, and direct them to repair immediately to Philadelphia. It is an unlucky circumstance that the term of enlistment of these three companies, and of the
<PB N="146" REF="031423_0145_0FEC479270E14288"/>
rifle battalion, should expire at this time, when a hot campaign is, in all probability, about to commence.</P>
<P>Canada, it is certain, would have been an important acquisi∣tion, and well worth the expenses incurred in the pursuit of it. But as we could not reduce it to our possession, the retreat of our army with so little loss, under such a variety of distres∣ses, must be esteemed a most fortunate event. It is true, the ac∣counts we have received, do not fully authorise us to say that we have sustained no loss: but they hold forth a probable ground for such conclusion.—I am anxious to hear it confirm∣ed.</P>
<P>I have the honor of transmitting you an extract of a letter received last night from general Ward.—If the scheme the privateers had in view, and the measures he had planned, have been carried into execution, the Highland corps will be tolerably well disposed of: but I fear the fortunate event has not taken place.</P>
<P>In general Ward's letter, was inclosed one from lieutenant-col∣onel Campbell, who was made prisoner with the Highland troops. I have transmitted you a copy. This will give you a full and ex∣act account of the number of prisoners that were on Board the four transports; and will prove, beyond a possibility of doubt, that the evacuation of Boston by the British troops was a matter neither known nor expected when he received his orders. Indeed so ma∣ny facts had concurred before to settle the matter, that no additi∣onal proofs were necessary.</P>
<P>When I had the honor of addressing you yesterday, I had only been informed of the arrival of forty-five of the fleet in the morning. Since that, I have received authentic intelli∣gence from sundry persons (among them, from general Greene) that a hundred and ten sail came in before night, that were count∣ed, and that more were seen about dusk in the offing—I have no doubt but the whole that sailed from Halifax are now at the Hook.</P>
<P>Just as I was about to conclude my letter, I received one from a gentleman upon the subject of calling the five regiments from Boston to the defence of Canada or New-York, and to have militia raised in their lieu.—I have sent you a copy, and shall only observe, that I know the author well; his hand-writing is quite familiar to me: he is a member of the general court, very sensible, of great influence, and a warm and zealous friend to the cause of America.—The expedient proposed by him is submit∣ted to Congress.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you, and on the same day, several ships more arrived within the Hook, making the number that came in then a hundred and ten; and there remains no doubt of the whole of the fleet from Halifax being now here. Yesterday evening fifty of them came up the bay, and anchored on the Staten-Island side. Their views I cannot precisely determine; but am extremely apprehensive, as part of them only came, that they mean to surround the island, and se∣cure the stock upon it. I had consulted with a committee of the provincial Congress upon the subject, before the arrival of the fleet; and they appointed a person to superintend the busiuess, and to drive the stock off. I also wrote to brigadier-general Heard, and directed him to the measure, lest it might be neglected; but am fearful it has not been effected.</P>
<P>Our reinforcement of militia is yet but small:—I cannot as∣certain the amount, not having got a return. However, I trust, if the enemy make an attack, they will meet with a repulse, as I have the pleasure to inform you that an agreeable spirit and willingness for action seem to animate and pervade the whole of our troops.</P>
<P>As it is difficult to determine what objects the enemy may have in contemplation, and whether they may not detach some part of their force to Amboy, and to ravage that part of the country, if not extend their views farther, I submit it to Con∣gress whether it may not be expedient for them to repeat and press home their requests to the different governments that are to provide men for the flying camp, to furnish their quotas with all possible dispatch. It is a matter of great importance, and will be of serious consequence, to have the camp established in case the enemy should be able to possess themselves of this river, and cut off the supplies of troops that might be necessary on certain emer∣gencies to be sent from hence.</P>
<P>I must entreat your attention to an application I made some time ago, for flints. We are extremely deficient in this necessary arti∣cle, and shall be greatly distressed if we cannot obtain a supply. Of lead we have a sufficient quantity for the whole campaign, taken off the houses here.</P>
<P>Estimating it of infinite advantage to prevent the enemy from getting fresh provisions, and horses for their waggons, ar∣tillery, &amp;c. I gave orders to a party of our men on Staten-Is∣land (since writing to general Heard) to drive the stock off, without waiting for the assistance or direction of the commit∣tees
<PB N="148" REF="031423_0147_0FEC59F745822BE8"/>
there, lest their slow mode of transacting business might produce too much delay;—and have sent this morning to know what they have done.—I am this morning informed by a gentleman, that the committee of Elizabeth-town sent their company of light∣horse on monday to effect it, and that some of their militia were to give their aid yesterday. He adds that he was credibly told last night by a party of the militia coming to this place, that yes∣sterday they saw a good deal of stock driving off the island, and crossing to the Jerseys.—If the business is not executed before now, it will be impossible to do it.</P>

<P>WHEN I had the honor to address you on the thirtieth ultimo, I transmited a copy of a letter I had received from a gentleman, a member of the honorable general court [<HI>of Mas∣sachusetts</HI>] suggesting the improbability of succours coming from thence in any reasonable time, either for the defence of this place, or to reinforce our troops engaged in the Canada expedition. I am sorry to inform you, that from a variety of intelligence, his apprehensions appear to be just, and to be fully confirmed: nor have I reason to expect but that the supplies from the other two governments, Connecticut and New-Hamp∣shire,
<PB N="149" REF="031423_0148_0FEC59F9A95D91B0"/>
will be extremely slow and greatly deficient in num∣ber.</P>
<P>As it now seems beyond question, and clear to demonstrati∣on, that the enemy mean to direct their operations and bend their most vigorous efforts against this colony, and will attempt to unite their two armies, that under general Burgoyne, and the one arrived here,—I cannot but think the expedient pro∣posed by that gentleman is excedingly just; and that the conti∣nental regiments, now in the Massachusetts-Bay, should be im∣mediately called from thence, and be employed where there is the strongest reason to believe their aid will be indispensably necessa∣ry. The expediency of the measure I shall submit to the conside∣ratation of Congress, and will only observe, as my opinion, that there is not the most distant prospect of an attempt being made, where they now are, by the enemy; and, if there should, that the militia that can be assembled upon the shortest notice will be more than equal to repel it. They are well armed, resolute, and determined, and will instantly oppose any invasion that may be made in their own colony.</P>
<P>I shall also take the liberty again to request Congress to interest themselves in having the militia raised, and forwarded with all possible expedition, as fast as any considerable number of them can be collected, that are to compose the flying camp. This I men∣tioned in my letter yesterday but think proper to repeat it, being more and more convinced of the necessity. The camp will be in the neighborhood of Amboy: and I shall be glad that the conventions, or committees of safety, of those governments from whence they come, may be requested to give me previous notice of their march∣ing, that I may form some plan, and direct provision to be made for their reception.</P>
<P>The disaffection of the people at that place and others not far distant, is exceedingly great; and, unless it is checked and overawed, it must become more general, and be very alarming. The arrival of the enemy will encourage it. They, or at least a part of them, are already landed on Staten-Island which is quite contiguous; and about four thousand were marching a∣bout it yesterday, as I have been advised, and are leaving no arts un-essayed to gain the inhabitants to their side, who seem but too favorably disposed. It is not unlikely that in a little time they may attempt to cross to the Jersey side, and induce many to join them either from motives of interest or fear, unless there is a force to oppose them.</P>
<P>As we are fully convinced that the ministerial army we shall have to oppose this campaign, will be great and numerous, and
<PB N="150" REF="031423_0149_0FEC59FB4CDB7548"/>
well know that the utmost industry will be used, as it already has been to excite the savages and every body of people to arms against us whom they can influence, it certainly behoves us to strain every nerve to counteract their designs. I would therefore submit it to Congress whether, (especially as our schemes for employing the western Indians do not seem to be attended with any great prospect of success, from general Schuy∣ler's accounts) it may not be adviseable to take measures to en∣gage those of the eastward, the St. Johns, Nova-Scotia, Pe∣nobscot, &amp;c. in our favor. I have been told that several might be got, perhaps five or six hundred or more, readily to join us. If they can, I should imagine it ought to be done. It will pre∣vent our enemies from securing their friendship; and further they will be of infinite service in annoying and harrassing them, should they ever attempt to penetrate the country. Congress will be pleased to consider the measure: and if they determine to adopt it, I conceive it will be necessary to authorise and re∣quest the general court of the Massachusetts-Bay to carry it into execution. Their situation and advantages will enable them to ne∣gotiate a treaty and an alliance better than it can be done by any person else.</P>
<P>I have been honored with your two favors of the first instant; and, agreeable to the wishes of Congress, shall put monsieur Wiebert in the best place I can to prove his abilities in the art he professes. I shall send him up immediately to the works erecting towards Kingsbridge, under the direction of general Mifflin, whom I shall request to employ him.</P>
<P>I this moment received a letter from general Greene, an extract of which I have inclosed. The intelligence it contains is of the most important nature, and evinces the necessity of the most spirited and vigorous exertions on our part.</P>
<P>The expectation of the fleet under admiral Howe is certainly the reason the army already come have not begun their hostile operations. When that arrives, we may look for the most in∣teresting events, and such as, in all probability, will have consi∣derable weight in the present contest. It behoves us to be prepar∣ed in the best manner: and I submit it again to Congress, whe∣ther the accounts given by their prisoners do not shew the proprie∣ty of calling the several continental regiments from the Massachu∣setts government, raising the flying camp with all possible dispatch, and engaging the eastern Indians.</P>
<P><HI>July 5.</HI>—General Mercer arrived here on tuesday, and the next morning was ordered to Paulus-Hook, to make some arrangements of the militia as they come in, and the best dis∣position
<PB N="151" REF="031423_0150_0FEC59FF33F70638"/>
he could to prevent the enemy crossing from Staten-Island, if they should have any such views. The distressed situ∣ation of the inhabitants of Elizabeth. Town and Newark has since induced me, upon their application, to give up all the militia from the Jerseys, except those engaged for six months. I am hopeful they will be able to repel any incursions that may be attempted. Generals Mercer and Livingston are concerting plans for that purpose. By a letter from the latter last night, I am informed the enemy are throwing up small works at all the passes on the north side of Staten Island, which it is probable they mean to secure.</P>
<P>None of the Connecticut militia are yet arrived: so that the reinforcement we have received is very inconsiderable.</P>
<P>A letter from general Schuyler, with sundry inclosures (of which No. 1, 2, and 3, are exact copies), this moment came to hand, and will no doubt claim, as it ought to do, the imme∣diate attention of Congress. The evils which must inevitably follow a disputed command are too obvious and alarming to ad∣mit a moment's delay in your decision thereupon: and, al∣though I do not presume to advise in a matter, now, of this delicacy, yet as it appears evident that the northern army has retreated to Crown-Point, and mean to act upon the defensive only, I cannot help giving it as my opinion that one of the ma∣jor-generals in that quarter would be more usefully employed here, or in the flying camp, than there: for it becomes my duty to observe, if another experienced officer is taken from hence in order to command the flying camp, that your grand army will be entirely stripped of generals who have seen service,—being in a manner already destitute of such. My distress on this account,—the appointment of general Whitcomb to the eastern regiments,—a conviction in my own breast that no troops will be sent to Boston,—and the certainty of a number coming to this place,—occasioned by postponing, from time to time, send∣ing any general officer from hence to the eastward heretofore: and now I shall wait the sentiments of Congress relative to the five regiments in Massachusetts-Bay, before I do any thing in this matter.</P>
<P>The commissary-general has been with me this morning, con∣cerning the other matter contained in general Schuyler's letter respecting the business of that department. He has, I believe, (in order to remove difficulties), recalled Mr. Avery, but seems to think it necessary in that case, that Mr. Livingston should be left to himself, as he cannot be responsible for per∣sons not of his own appointment.—This matter should also be
<PB N="152" REF="031423_0151_0FEC5A06D5A8AD80"/>
clearly defined by Congress.—I have already giving my opinion of the necessity of these matters being under one general direc∣tion, in so full and clear a manner, that I shall not take up the time of Congress to repeat it in this place.</P>

<P>CONGRESS having resolved to raise a regiment of Ger∣mans to counteract the designs of our enemies, I must beg leave to recommend to their notice John David Wilpert, now a first lieutenant in colonel Shee's battallion, to the office of captain in said regiment. I am personally acquainted with him, and know that he joined the Virginia forces under my command in the year 1754, and continued in service the whole war, during which he conducted himself as an active, vigilant, and brave officer. He is a German; and his merit, as a soldier, entitles him much to the office he wishes for.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of the fourth and fifth instant, which came duly to hand, with their important inclosures.</P>
<P>I perceive that Congress have been employed in deliberating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n measutes of the most interesting nature. It is certain that it is not with us to determine in many instances what conse∣quences will flow from our councils; but yet it behoves us to adopt such, as, under the smiles of a gracious and all-kind pro∣vidence, will be most likely to promote our happiness. I trust the late decisive part they have taken is calculated for that end, and will secure us that freedom and those priviledges, which have been and are refused us, contrary to the voice of nature and the British constitution. Agreeable to the request of Con∣gress, I caused "THE DECLARATION" to be proclaim∣ed before all the army under my immediate command; and have the pleasure to inform them that the measure seemed to have their most hearty assent,—the expressions and behavior, both of officers and men, testifying their warmest approbation of it. I have transmitted a copy to general Ward at Boston,
<PB N="153" REF="031423_0152_0FEC5A09D7495D60"/>
requesting him to have it proclaimed to the continental troops in that department.</P>
<P>It is with great pleasure that I hear the militia from Maryland, the Delaware government, and Pennsylvania, will be in mo∣tion every day to form the flying camp. It is of great im∣portance, and should be accomplished with all possible dispatch. The readiness and alacrity, with which the committee of safety of Pennsylvania and the other conferees have acted in order to forward the associated militia of that state to the Jerseys for service, till the men to compose the flying camp arrive, strongly evidence their regard to the common cause, and that nothing on their part will be wanting to support it. I hope, and I doubt not, that the associated militia, impressed with the ex∣pediency of the measure, will immediately carry it into execution, and furnish in this instance a proof of the continuance of that zeal which has so eminently marked their conduct. I have directed the commissary to make the necessary provision for their re∣ception, who will also supply the army for the flying camp with rations.—A proper officer will be appointed to com∣mand it.</P>
<P>In pursuance of the power given me by Congress, and the advice of my general officers, I have wrote to general Ward, and desired him forthwith to detach three of the fullest regiments from the Massachusetts-Bay to join the northern army,—es∣teeming it a▪ matter of the greatest importance to have a suffi∣cient force there to prevent the enemy passing the lake and mak∣ing an impression in that quarter.—The gondolas and gallies will be of great service; and I am hopeful the carpenters you have sent from Philadelphia, and that will go from the eastward on your ap∣plication, will be able to build a sufficient number in time to an∣swer every exigency.</P>
<P>I have requested governor Cooke, if the duck mentioned in Mr. Greene's letter is proper for tents, to have it made up as early as possible and forwarded here. I have also desired him to send the flints and small-arms, as I gave general Ward those of the latter that were taken out of the Scotch transports,—our deficiency in these necessary articles being still great.</P>
<P>Observing that Congress have particularly mentioned a bounty of ten dollars to be paid to men of some corps directed to be raised in two or three instances since their resolve of the twenty-sixth of June allowing such bounty, I have been led to doubt how that resolve is to be construed; whether it is a general re∣gulation, and extends to all men that will engage for three years,—for instance, the soldiers of the present army, if they
<PB N="154" REF="031423_0153_0FEC5A0B8E34B030"/>
will enlist for that time. If it is, and extends to them, it will be necessary to forward a large sum of money:—many perhaps would engage.</P>
<P>I also observe, by their resolve of the twenty-fifth of June for raising four regiments of militia in the eastern governments to augment the troops in the northern department, that the as∣semblies of those governments are empowered to appoint pay∣masters to the said regiments. This appears, to me a regulation of great use, and I could wish that it was made general, and one allowed to every regiment in the service. Many advantages would result from it.</P>
<P>The Connecticut militia begin to come in: but from every account the battalions will be very incomplete,—owing, they say, to the busy season of the year. That government, lest any inconvenience might result from their militia not being here in time, ordered three regiments of their light-horse to my assistance, part of which have arrived. But, not having the means to support them (and, if it could be done, the expense would be enormous), I have thanked the gentlemen for their zeal, and the attachment they have manifested upon this occasion, and informed them that I cannot consent to their keeping their horses,—at the same time wishing them to stay them∣selves.—I am told they or part of them mean to do so.</P>
<P>General Mercer is now in the Jerseys, for the purpose of receiv∣ing and ordering the militia coming for the flying camp: and I have sent over our chief engineer to view the ground within the neighborhood of Amboy, and to lay out some ne∣cessary works for the encampment, and such as may be proper at the different passes in Bergen-neck, and other places on the Jer∣sey shore opposite Staten Island, to prevent the making impressions, and committing depredations on the property of the inhabit∣ants.</P>
<P>The intelligence that we have from a few deserters that have come over to us, and from others, is that general Howe has between nine and ten thousand men, who are chiefly landed on the island, posted in different parts, and securing the several com∣munications from the Jerseys with small works and intrench∣ments, to prevent our people from paying them a visit;—that the islanders have all joined them, seem well disposed to favor their cause, and have agreed to take up arms in their behalf. They look for admiral Howe's arrival every day with his fleet and a large reinforcement; are in high spirits, and talk confident∣ly of success, and carrying all before them when he comes. I trust, through divine favor and our own exertions, they will
<PB N="155" REF="031423_0154_0FEC5A0D34CC1D00"/>
be disappointed in their views; and at all events, any advan∣tages they may gain will cost them very dear. If our troops will behave well (which I hope will be the case, having every thing to contend for, that freemen hold dear), they will have to wade through much blood and slaughter before they can car∣ry any part of our works, if they carry them at all,—and, at best, be in possession of a melancholy and mournful victory.—May the sacredness of our cause inspire our soldiery with senti∣ments of heroism, and lead them to the preformances of the noblest exploits!</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored with your favor of the eighth instant by yes∣terday morning's post, with the several resolves to which you refer∣red my attention. I shall duly regard them, and attempt their exe∣cution as far as I am able.</P>
<P>By virtue of the discretionary power that Congress were pleased to vest me with, and by advice of such of my general officers as I have had an opportunity of consulting, I have ordered the two remaining continental regiments in the Massachusetts-Bay to march immediately for the defence of this place, in full confi∣dence that nothing hostile will be attempted against that state in the present campaign.</P>
<P>I have wrote to the general court of Massachusetts-Bay, and transmitted a copy of the resolve for employing the eastern Indi∣ans, entreating their good offices in this instance, and their exerti∣ons to have them forthwith engaged and marched to join this ar∣my. I have desired five or six hundred of them to be enlisted for two or three years, if they will consent to it,—subject to an ear∣lier discharge, if it shall be thought necessary,—and upon the same terms as the continental troops, if better cannot be had,—though I am hopeful they may.</P>
<P>In my letter of yesterday I mentioned the arrival of part of the Connecticut light-horse to assist in the defence of this place, and my objection to their horses being kept. Four or five hundred of them are now come in: and, in justice to their zeal and laudable attachment to the cause of their country, I am to inform you that they have consented to stay as long as occasion may require, though they should be at the expence of maintain∣ing their horses themselves. They have pastured them out a∣bout the neighborhood of Kingsbridge (being unwilling to send
<PB N="156" REF="031423_0155_0FEC5A0EEAFE0310"/>
them away) at the rate of half a dollar per week each, mean∣ing to leave it entirely with Congress either to allow or refuse it, as they shall judge proper. I promised to make this repre∣sentation, and thought it my duty: and will only observe that the motives which induced them first to set out were good and praise-worthy, and were to afford the most speedy and early succour, which they apprehended would be wanted before the militia arrived. Their services may be extremely important,—being most of them, if not all, men of reputation and of pro∣perty.</P>
<P>The subject of the inclosed copy of a letter from governor Trumbull I beg leave to submit to the consideration of Con∣gress. They will perceive from his representation, the disquieting apprehensions that have seized on the minds of the people since the retreat of the northern army, and how exposed the northern frontiers of New-York and New-Hampshire are to the ravages and incursions of the Indians. How far it may be expedient to raise the battallion he conceives necessary to prevent the calami∣ties and distresses he points out, they will determine, upon what he has said, and the necessity that may appear to them for the measure;—what I have done, being only to lay the matter before them in compliance with his wishes.</P>
<P>I have also inclosed a memorial from the surgeons'-mate, set∣ting forth the inadequacy of their pay to their services and main∣tenance, and praying that it may be increased. I shall observe that they have a long time complained in this instance, and that some additional allowance may not be unnecessary.</P>
<P>As I am truly sensible the time of Congress is much taken up with a variety of important matters, it is with unwillingness and pain I ever repeat a request after having once made it, or take the liberty of enforcing any opinion of mine after it is once given; but as the establishing of some office for auditing accounts is a matter of exceeding importance to the public in∣terest I would beg leave once more to call the attention of Congress to an appointment competent to the purpose. Two motives induce me to urge the matter; first, a conviction of the utility of the measure;—secondly, that I may stand excul∣pated if hereafter it should appear that money has been impro∣perly expended, and necessaries for the army obtained upon unrea∣sonable terms.</P>
<P>For me, whose time is employed from the hour of my rising till I retire to bed again, to go into an examination of the ac∣counts of such an army as this with any degree of precision and exactness, without neglecting other matters of equal impor∣tance,
<PB N="157" REF="031423_0156_0FEC5A12DC514868"/>
is utterly impracticable. All that I have been able to do (and that, in fact, was doing nothing), was, when the com∣missary, and quarter-master, and director-general of the hospi∣tal (for it is to these the great advances are made) applied for warrants,—to make them at times produce a general account of their expenditures. But this answers no valuable purpose. It is the minutiae that must be gone into,—the propriety of each charge examined,—the vouchers looked into;—and, with re∣spect to the commissary-general, his victualling returns and ex∣penditures of provisions should be compared with his purchases: otherwise a person in this department, if he was inclined to be knavish, might purchase large quantities with the public money, and sell one half of it again for private emolument; and yet his accounts upon paper would appear fair, and be supported with vouchers for every charge.</P>
<P>I do not urge this matter from a suspicion of any unfair prac∣tices in either of the departments before mentioned; and sorry should I be if this construction was put upon it,—having a high opinion of the honor and integrity of these gentlemen. But there should, nevertheless, be some control as well upon their discretion as honesty:—to which may be added, that accounts become perplexed and confused by long standing, and the er∣rors therein not so discoverable as if they underwent an early revision and examination. I am well apprised that a treasury-office of accounts has been resolved upon, and an auditor-gene∣ral for settling all public accounts; but, with all deference and submission to the opinion of Congress, these institutions are not calculated to prevent the inconveniencies I have mentioned; nor can they be competent to the purposes, circumstanced as they are.</P>
<P>We have intelligence from a deserter that came to us, that, on wednesday morning, the Asia, Chatham, and Greyhound men-of-war weighed anchor, and (it was said) intended to pass up the North-river above the city, to prevent the communica∣tion with the Jerseys. They did not attempt it, nor does he know what prevented them.—A prisoner belonging to the tenth regiment, taken yesterday, informs that they hourly expected admiral Howe and his fleet. He adds that a vessel has arrived from them, and the prevailing opinion is, that an attack will be made immediately on their arrival.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, I am informed that the small-pox has broke out at Boston, and infected some of the troops. I have wrote to him to place the invalids under an officer, to remain till they are well; and to use every possible
<PB N="158" REF="031423_0157_0FEC5A150D63BFE8"/>
precaution to prevent the troops from thence bringing the infection. The distresses and calamities we have already suffered by this disorder in one part of our army, I hope, will excite his utmost care that they may not be increased.</P>

<P>THE design of this is to inform Congress, that, about half after three o'clock this evening, two of the enemy's ships of war, one of forty and the other of twenty guns, with three tenders, weighed anchor in the bay opposite Staten-Island, and, availing themselves of a brisk and favorable breeze, with a flowing tide, ran past our batteries up the North-river, without receiving any certain damage that I could perceive, notwith∣standing a heavy and incessant cannonade was kept up from our several batteries here, as well as from that at Paulus-Hook. They, on their part, returned and continued the fire as they ran by.—I dispatched an express to brigadier-general Mifflin at our encampment towards the upper end of the Island; but have not heard whether they have got by, or received any da∣mage.</P>
<P>The account transmitted by this morning's post, respecting the arrival of one of the fleet, seems to be confirmed. Several ships have come in to-day: among them, one this evening with a Saint-George's flag at her fore-top-mast-head, which we con∣clude to be admiral Howe from the circumstances of the flag, and the several and general salutes that were paid. It is pro∣bable they will all arrive in a day or two, and immediately begin their operations.</P>
<P>As it will be extremely necessary that the flying camp should be well provided with powder and ball, and it may be imprac∣ticable to send supplies from hence on account of our hurry and engagements (besides, the communication may be uncertain), I must beg the attention of Congress to this matter, and request that they will forward with all possible expedition such a quan∣tity of musket-powder and lead (if balls of different sizes can∣not be had), as will be sufficient for the militia to compose that camp.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last of friday evening, which I had the honor of ad∣dressing you, advised that two of the enemy's ships of war and three tenders had run above our batteries here and the works at the upper end of the Island. I am now to inform you, that, yesterday afternoon, receiving intelligence from general Mifflin that they had passed the Tappan-sea, and were trying to pro∣ceed higher up,—by advice of R. R. Livingston, esquire, and other gentlemen, I dispatched expresses to general Clinton of Ulster, and the committee of safety for Dutchess-county, to take measures for securing the passes in the Highlands, lest they might have designs of seizing them, and have a force con∣cealed for the purpose. I wrote the evening before to the commanding officer of the two garrisons there to be vigilant and prepared against any attempts they or any disaffected persons might make against them, and to forward expresses all the way to Albany, that provision and other vessels might be secured and pre∣vented falling into their hands.</P>
<P>The information given general Mifflin was rather premature, as to their having gone past the Sea.—A letter from the com∣mittee of Orange-county, which come to hand this morning, says they were there yesterday, and that a regiment of their militia was under arms, to prevent their landing, and making an incur∣sion. The messenger who brought it, and to whom it refers for particulars, adds that a party of them, in two or three boats, had approached the shore, but were forced back by our people firing at them. Since the manoeuvre of friday, there have been no other movements in the fleet.</P>
<P>General Sullivan, in a letter of the second instant, informs me of his arrival with the army at Crown-Point, where he is fortifying and throwing up works. He adds, that he has secur∣ed all the stores except three cannon left at Chamblee which in part is made up by taking a fine twelve-pounder out of the lake.—The army is sickly,—many with the small-pox; and he is apprehensive, the militia ordered to join them, will not es∣cape the infection.—An officer he had sent to reconnoitre had re∣ported that he saw at Saint John's about a hundred and fifty tents,—twenty at Saint Roy's, and fifteen at Chamblee; and works at the first were busily carrying on.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a general return of the army here, which will shew the whole of our strength. All the detached posts are in∣cluded.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="031423_0159_0FEC5A1D72882458"/>
A letter from the eastward, by last night's post to Mr. Ha∣zard, post-master in this city, advises that two ships had been taken and carried into Cape-Ann,—one from Autigua, consigned to general Howe, with four hundred and thirty-nine punche∣ons of rum,—the other a Jamaica-man, with four hundred hogs∣heads of sugar, two hundred puncheons of rum, thirty-nine bales of cotton, pimento, fustic, &amp;c. &amp;c. Each mounted two guns, six pounders.</P>
<P>About three o'clock this afternoon I was informed that a flag from lord Howe was coming up, and waited with two of our whale-boats, until directions should be given, I immedi∣ately convened such of the general officers as were not upon other duty, who agreed in opinion that I ought not to receive any letters directed to me as a private gentleman: but if other∣wise, and the officer desired to come up to deliver the letter him∣self, as was suggested, he should come under a safe conduct. Upon this, I directed colonel Reed to go down and manage the affair under the above general instruction.</P>
<P>On his return, he informed me, that after the common civi∣lities, the officer acquainted him that he had a letter from lord Howe to Mr. Washington, which he shewed under a subscrip∣tion, "<HI>To George Washington, esquire.</HI>"—Colonel Reed repli∣ed, there was no such person in the army, and that a letter in∣tended for the general, could not be received under such a di∣rection.—The officer expressed great concern,—said it was a letter rather of a civil than military nature,—that lord Howe regretted he had not arrived sooner,—that he (lord Howe) had great powers▪—The anxiety to have the letter received was very evident, though the officer disclaimed all knowledge of its contents. However, colonel Reed's instructions being positive, they parted.—After they had got some distance, the officer with the flag again put about and asked under what di∣rection Mr. Washington chose to be addressed: to which colonel Reed answered, his station was well known, and that certainly they could be at no loss how to direct to him.—The officer said they knew it and lamented it; and again repeated his wish that the letter could be received.—Colonel Reed told him a proper direction would obviate all difficulties, and that this was no new matter,—this subject having been fully discussed in the course of last year; of which lord Howe could not be ignorant:—upon which they parted.</P>
<P>I would not upon any occasion sacrifice essentials to punc∣tilio: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in this instance, the opinion of others concurring with my own, I deemed it a duty to my country and my ap∣pointment,
<PB N="161" REF="031423_0160_0FEC5A20E453FCE0"/>
to insist upon that respect, which, in any other than a public view, I would willingly have waved. Nor do I doubt, but from the supposed nature of the message, and the anxiety ex∣pressed, they will either repeat their flag, or fall upon some mode to communicate the import and [<HI>contents</HI>] of it.</P>
<P>I have been duly honored with your two letters,—that of the tenth by Mr. Anderson,—and the eleventh with its inclosures. I have directed the quarter-master to provide him with every thing he wants to carry his scheme into execution. It is an important one, and I wish it success; but am doubtful that it will be better in theory than practice.</P>
<P>The passage of the ships of war and tenders up the river is a mat∣ter of great importance, and has excited much conjecture and speculation. To me two things have occurred as leading them to this proceeding,—first a design to seize on the narrow passes on both sides of the river, giving almost the only land com∣munication with Albany, and of consequence, with our north∣ern army; for which purpose, they might have troops concealed on board, which they deemed competent of themselves, as the defiles are narrow,—or; that they would be joined by many disaffected persons in that quarter. Others have added a probability of their having a large quantity of arms on board, to be in readiness to put into the hands of the to∣ries immediately on the arrival of the fleet, or rather at the time they intend to make their attack.—The second is, to cut off entirely all intercourse between this and Albany, by water, and the upper country, and to prevent supplies of every kind going and coming.</P>
<P>These matters are truly alarming, and of such importance, that I have wrote to the provincial congress of New-York, and recom∣mended to their serious consideration the adoption of every possible expedient to guard against the two first; and have suggested the propriety of their employing the militia, or some part of them, in the counties in which these defiles are, to keep the enemy from possessing them, till further provision can be made; and to write to the several leading persons on our side in that quarter, to be at∣tentive to all the movements of the ships and the disaffected, in or∣der to discover and frustrate whatever pernicious schemes they have in view.</P>
<P>In respect to the second conjecture of my own, and which seems to be generally adopted, I have the pleasure to inform Con∣gress, that, if their design is to keep the armies from provi∣sion, the commissary has told me upon inquiry, he has for∣warded supplies to Albany snow there, and above it) sufficient
<PB N="162" REF="031423_0161_0FEC5A2277846700"/>
for ten thousand men for four months;—that he has a sufficiency here for twenty thousand men for three months, and an abun∣dant quantity secured in different parts of the Jerseys for the flying camp, besides having about four thousand barrels of flour in some neighbouring part of Connecticut. Upon this head, there is but little occasion for any apprehensions, at least for a considera∣ble time.</P>

<P>THIS will be handed you by Mr. Griffin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has also taken upon him the charge and delivery of two packers containing sun∣dry letters which were sent to Amboy yesterday by a flag, and forwarded to me to-day by general Mercer.—The letter addressed to governor Franklin came open to my hands.</P>
<P>I was this morning honored with yours of the thirteenth instant, with its important and necessary inclosures; and, in obedience to the commands of Congress, have transmitted general Howe the re∣solves intended for him. Those for general Burgoyne I enclosed and sent to general Schuyler, with directions immediately to for∣ward them to him.</P>
<P>The inhuman treatment of the whole, and murder of part of our people, after their surrender and capitulation, was certainly a flagrant violation of that saith which ought to be held sacred by all civilized nations, and founded in the most savage bar∣barity. It highly deserved the severest reprobation; and I trust the spirited measures Congress have adopted upon the occasion, will prevent the like in future: but if they should not, and the claims of humanity are disregarded, justice and policy will re∣quire recourse to be had to the law of retaliation, however abhor∣rent and disagreeable to our natures in cases of torture and capital punishments.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honored with yours of the fifteenth in∣stant, with sundry resolves.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="031423_0162_0FEC5A2411F26410"/>
I perceive the measures Congress have taken to expedite the raising of the flying camp, and providing it with articles of the greatest use. You will see by a postscript to my letter of the fourteenth, I had wrote to the commanding officer of the Penn∣sylvania militia, ordering them to be marched from Trenton to Amboy, as their remaining there could not answer the least public good. For, having consulted with sundry gentlemen, I was informed, if the enemy mean to direct their views to∣wards Pennsylvania, or penetrate the Jerseys, their route will be from near Amboy, and either by way of Brunswick or Bound-Brook,—the lower road from South-Amboy being through a woody, sandy country. Besides, they will be then able to throw in succour here, and to receive it from hence in cases of emergency.</P>
<P>The Connecticut light-horse, mentioned in my letter of the eleventh, notwithstanding their then promise to continue here for the defence of this place, are now discharged, and about to return home,—having peremptorily refused all kind of fatigue, duty, or even to mount guard, claiming an exemption as troop∣ers. Though their assistance is much needed, and might be of essential service in case of an attack, yet I judged it advisable, on their application and claim of such indulgences, to discharge them; as granting them would set an example to others, and might produce many ill consequences. The number of men included in the last return, by this, is lessened about five hun∣dred.</P>
<P>I last night received a letter from general Schuyler, with several inclosures, copies of which I have herewith transmit∣ted. They will give Congress every information I have re∣specting our northern army and the situation of our affairs in that quarter;—to which I beg leave to refer their attention.—I cannot but express my surprise at the scarcity of provision which general Schuyler mentions, after what the commissary assured me, and which formed a part of my letter of the four∣teenth. He still assures me of the same.—This is a distressing circumstance, as every article of provision, and every thing necessary for that department, can have no other now than a land∣conveyence, the water-communication from hence to Albany being entirely cut off.</P>
<P>Congress will please to consider the inclosure, No. 6, about raising six companies out of the inhabitants about the lakes, to prevent the incursions of the Indians. The general officers, in their minutes of council have determined it a matter of much importance;—and their attention to the price of goods fur∣nished
<PB N="164" REF="031423_0163_0FEC5A27222C2758"/>
the soldiery may be extremely necessary. They have com∣plained much upon this head.</P>
<P>The retreat from Crown-Point seems to be considered in oppo∣site views by the general and field-officers. The former (I am satisfied) have weighed the matter well; and yet the reason assign∣ed by the latter against it appears strong and forcible.—I hope whatever is done will be for the best.</P>
<P>By a letter from the committee of Orange-Country, received this morning, the men-of-war and tenders were yesterday at Haversham-bay, about forty miles above this. A number of men, in four barges from the tenders, attempted to land, with a view (they suppose) of taking some sheep and cattle, that had been previously removed.—A small number of militia that were collected obliged them to retreat, without their doing any damage, with their cannon.—They were sounding the water up towards the Highlands: by which it is probable they will attempt to pass with part of the fleet, if possible.</P>
<P>Yesterday evening a flag came from general Howe, with a letter addressed "<HI>To George Washington, esquire, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"—It was not received, upon the same principle that the one from lord Howe was refused.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>New-York,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 19, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the sixteenth and seventeenth, with the several resolves they contained; to the execution of which, so far as shall be in my power, I will pay pro∣per attention.</P>
<P>In my letter of the seventeenth I transmitted you a copy of one from general Schuyler, and of its several inclosures.—I confess the determination of the council of general officers on the seventh, to retreat from Crown-Point, surprised me much; and the more I consider it, the more striking does the impro∣priety appear. The reason assigned against it by the field-officers, in their remonstrance, coincide greatly with my own ideas and those of the other general officers I have had an op∣pertunity of consulting with, and seem to be of considerable weight,—I may add, conclusive.—I am not so fully acquainted with the geography of that country and the situation of the different posts, as to pronounce a peremptory judgment upon the matter; but, if my ideas are right, the possession of Crown-Point
<PB N="165" REF="031423_0164_0FEC5A2C9EE871F0"/>
is essential, to give us the superiority and mastery upon the lake.</P>
<P>That the enemy will possess it as soon as abandoned by us, there can be no doubt; and if they do, whatever gallies or force we keep on the lake will be unquestionably in the rear.—How they are to be supported there, or what succour can be drawn from them there, is beyond my comprehension.—Perhaps it is only meant that they should be employed on the communication between that and Tyconderoga. If this is the case, I fear the views of Con∣gress will not be answered, nor the salutary effects be derived from them, that were intended.</P>
<P>I have mentioned my surprise to general Schuyler, and would, by the advice of the general officers here, have directed that that post should be maintained, had it not been for two cau∣ses—an apprehension that the works have been destoyed, and that, if the army should be ordered from Tyconderoga, or the post opposite to it (where I presume they are), to repossess it, they would have neither one place nor another secure and in a defensible state:—the other, lest it might increase the jealousy and diversity of opinions which seem already too prevalent in that army, and establish a precedent for the inferior officers to set up their judgments whenever they would, in opposition to those of their superiors,—a matter of great delicacy, and that might lead to fatal consequences, if countenanced;—though in the present instance I could wish their reasoning had pre∣vailed.</P>
<P>If the army has not removed, what I have said to general Schuyler may perhaps bring on a re-consideration of the matter; and it may not be too late to take measures for maintaining that post. But of this I have no hope.</P>
<P>In consequence of the resolve of Congress for three of the eastern regiments to reinforce the northern army, I wrote to general Ward, and, by advice of my general officers, directed them to march to Norwich, and there to embark for Albany; con∣ceiving that two valuable purposes might result therefrom,—first, that they would sooner join the army by pursuing this route, and be saved from the distress and fatigue that must attend every long march through the country at this hot and un∣comfortable season;—and secondly, that they might give suc∣cour here, in case the enemy should make an attack about the time of their passing. But the enemy having now, with their ships of war and tenders, cut off the water-communication from hence to Albany, I have wrote this day and directed them to proceed by land across the country.—If Congress disapprove
<PB N="166" REF="031423_0165_0FEC5A31599944B8"/>
the route, or wish to give orders about them, you will please to certify me thereof, that I may take measures accordingly.</P>
<P>Inclosed I have the honor to transmit you copies of a letter and sundry resolutions which I received yesterday from the con∣vention of this state. By them you will perceive they have been acting upon matters of great importance, and are exerting themselves in the most vigorous manner to defeat the wick∣ed designs of the enemy, and such disaffected persons as may in∣cline to assist and facilitate their views.—In compliance with their request, and on account of the scarcity of money for carrying their salutary views into execution, I have agreed to lend them, out of the small stock now in hand (not more than sixty thousand dollars), twenty thousand dollars, in part of what they want; which they promise speedily to replace.—Had there been money sufficient for paying the whole of our troops, and no more, I could not have done it. But as it was o∣therwise, and by no means proper to pay a part and not the whole, I could not foresee any inconveniences that would attend the loan;—on the contrary, that it might contribute in some degree to for∣ward their schemes.—I hope my conduct in this instance will not be disapproved.</P>
<P>I inclosed governor Trumbull a copy of their letter and of their several resolves, to-day, by colonel Broom and Mr. Duer, two members of the convention, who are going to wait on him; but did not think myself at liberty to urge or request his in∣terest in forming the camp of six thousand men, as the levies, di∣rected by Congress to be furnished the third of June, for the defence of this place, by that government, are but little more than one third come in. At the same time, the proposition I think a good one, if it could be carried into execution. In case the enemy should attempt to effect a landing above Kings∣bridge, and to cut off the communication between this city and the country, an army to hang on their rear would distress them exceed∣ingly.</P>

<P>The inclosed paper should have been sent before, but was omit∣ted through hurry.</P>
<P>P. S. After I had closed my letter, I received one from general Ward, a copy of which is herewith transmitted.—I have wrote him to forward the two regiments now at Boston, by the most direct road, to Tyconderoga, as soon as they are well, with the utmost expedition; and consider their having had the small-pox, as a fortunate circumstance. When the three arrive which have marched for Norwich, I shall immediately send one

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favors of the eighteenth and nineteenth, with which you have been pleased to honor me, have been duly received, with the several resolves alluded to.</P>
<P>When the letter and declaration from lord Howe to Mr. Franklin, and the other late governors, come to be published, I should suppose the warmest advocates for dependence on the British crown must be silent, and be convinced beyond all pos∣sibility of doubt, that all that has been said about the commissi∣oners was illusory, and calculated expressly to deceive and un∣guard, not only the good people of our own country, but those of the English nation that were averse to the proceedings of the king and ministry. Hence we see the cause why a speci∣fication of their powers was not given the mayor and city of London, on their address requesting it. That would have been dangerous, because it would then have been manifested that the line of conduct they were to pursue would be totally variant from that they had industriously propagated, and amused the public with.—The uniting the civil and military offices in the same persons, too, must be conclusive to every thinking one, that there is to be but little negociation of the civil kind.</P>
<P>I have inclosed for the satisfaction of Congress, the sub∣stance of what passed between myself and lieutenant-colonel Patterson, adjutant-general, at an interview had yesterday, in
<PB N="168" REF="031423_0167_0FEC5A34B81131F8"/>
consequence of a request from general Howe the day before;—to which I beg leave to refer them for particulars.</P>
<P>Colonel Knox of the train having often mentioned to me the necessity of having a much more numerous body of artillerists than what there now is, in case the present contest should con∣tinue longer,—and knowing the deficiency in this instance, and their extreme usefulness,—I desired him to commit his ideas upon the subject to writing, in order that I might transmit them to Congress for their consideration. Agreeable to my request, he has done it; and the propriety of his plan is now submitted for their decision. It is certain that we have not more at this time than are sufficient for the several extensive posts we now have,—including draughts which he speaks of, and which, I presume (not only from what he has informed me, but from the nature of the thing,) can never be qualified to render the same service as if they were regularly appointed and formed into a corps for that particular purpose.</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind Congress that some time ago I laid be∣fore them the proposals of some persons here, for forming a com∣pany of light-horse; and the president's answer a little time after, intimated that the plan seemed to be approved of.—As those who wanted to make up the troop are frequently pressing me for an an∣swer, I could wish to be favored with the decision of Congress upon the subject.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Schuyler, of the fourteenth instant∣dated at Albany, he informs me, that, the day before, some desperate designs of the tories in that quarter had been disco∣vered, the particulars of which he could not divulge, being under an oath of secrecy;—however, that such measures had been taken, as to promise a prevention of the intended mischief: and that four of the conspirators (among them a ringleader) were apprehended about one o'clock that morning, not far from the town. What the plot was, or who were concerned in it, is a matter I am ignorant of as yet.</P>
<P>With my best regards to Congress, I have the honor to be your and their most obedient servant.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the pleasure of writing you by this morning's post, I was favored with a letter from governor Trumbull, a copy of which is inclosed, and to which I beg leave to refer you.—In regard to the stock he mentions, I wrote to him, re∣questing that they might be removed from the islands on which they were, as I conceived it of great importance to distress the enemy as much as possible in the article of fresh provision.—
<PB N="170" REF="031423_0169_0FEC5A3B8529EE10"/>
I wish the other governments may follow his example, and have it removed from the Islands belonging to them respec∣tively.</P>
<P>When the ships of war and tenders went up the river, it was thought expedient that application should be made for the Connecticut row-gallies and those belonging to Rhode-Island, in order to attempt something for their destruction. As soon as they arrive we shall try to employ them in some useful way,—but in what, or how successfully, I cannot at present deter∣mine.</P>
<P>Congress will please to observe what Mr. Trumbull says re∣specting the continental regiment raising under colonel Ward. If they incline to give any orders about their destination, you will please to communicate them by the earliest opportunity, as their march will be suspended till they are known.</P>
<P>The orders Mr. Trumbull has given to the officers of their crui∣sers, to stop provision vessels, seem to be necessary. We have too much reason to believe that some have gone voluntarily to the enemy, and that there are many persons who would continue to furnish them with large supplies; and, however upright the in∣tentions of others may be, it will be a matter of the utmost diffi∣culty, if not an impossibility,—for any to escape falling into their hands now, as every part of the coast (it is probable) will swarm with their ships of war and tenders. I had proposed writing to the convention of this state upon the subject before I received his letter; and am now more persuaded of the necessity of their taking some steps to prevent further exportations down the Sound. In my next I shall inform them of the intelligence receiv∣ed from Mr. Trumbull, and recommend the matter to their atten∣tion.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor to be, &amp;c. G. W.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>It appears absolutely necessary that the exportation of provision should be stopped. Our army is large, and other∣wise may want. Nor can individuals be injured, as they have a ready-money market for every thing they have to dispose of in that way.</P>

<P>DISAGREEABLE as it is to me and unpleasing as it may be to Congress to multiply officers, I find myself under the un∣avoidable necessity of asking an increase of my aids-de-camp.—The augmentation of my command,—the increase of my cor∣respondence,
<PB N="171" REF="031423_0170_0FEC5A3F003DD808"/>
—the orders to give,—the instructions to draw,—cut out more business than I am able to execute in time with proprie∣ty. The business of so many different departments centring with me, and by me to be handed on to Congress for their information,—added to the intercourse I am obliged to keep up with the ad∣jacent states,—and incidental occurrences,—all of which require confidential and not hack writers to execute,—renders it impossi∣ble, in the present state of things, for my family to discharge the several duties expected of me, with that precision and dispatch that I could wish.—What will it be then, when we come into a more active scene, and I am called upon from twenty different places perhaps at the same instant?</P>
<P>Congress will do me the justice to believe (I hope) that it is not my inclination or wish to run the continent to any unnecessary expense; and those who better know me will not suspect that show and parade can have any influence on my mind in this instance.—A conviction of the necessity of it, for the regular discharge of the trust reposed in me, is the governing motive for the application; and, as such, is submitted to Congress by, sir, your most obe∣dient, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday morning honored with your favor of the twenty-fourth instant with its several inclosures, to which I shall pay the strictest attention.</P>
<P>The confidence Congress are pleased to repose in my judg∣ment demands my warmest acknowledgments, and they may rest assured it shall be invariably employed, so far as it shall be in my power, to promote their views and the public weal.</P>
<P>Since my last, nothing material has occurred.—Yesterday even∣ing report was made that eight ships were seen in the offing, stand∣ing towards the Hook. The men-of-war and tenders are still up the river. They have never attempted to pass the Highland for∣tifications; and a day or two ago, quitted their station, and fell down the river eight or ten miles. The vigilance and activity of the militia opposite where they were, have prevented their landing and doing much injury.—One poor peasant's cot they plundered and then burnt.</P>
<P>I would wish to know whether the allowance given to offi∣cers, the seventeenth of January, of a dollar and one third for every man they enlist, Congress mean to extend to the officers
<PB N="172" REF="031423_0171_0FEC5A42178A69B8"/>
who enlist for the new army for three years. At first it may ap∣pear wrong, or rather exorbitant, supposing that many will be re∣cruited out of the regiments now in service, and under them: but the allowance will be of great use, as it will interest the offi∣cers, and call forth their exertions which otherwise would be faint and languid. Indeed I am fearful, from the enquiries I have made, that their utmost exertions will be attended with but little success. It is objected that the bounty of ten dollars is too low; and argued,—"if the states furnish men for five or six months, allow considerable more, why should that be accepted when the term of enlistment is to be for three years?"—I heartily wish a bounty in land had been or could be given, as was proposed some time ago. I think it would be attended with salutary con∣sequences.</P>
<P>In consequence of my application to governor Trumbull, he has sent me two row-gallies; and I expect another from him. None from governor Cooke are yet come; nor have I heard from him on the subject.—One is complete here.—The fire-ships are going on under Mr. Anderson's direction, but rather slowly; and I am preparing some obstructions for the channel nearly opposite the works at the upper end of this island.—When all things are ready, I intend to try, if it shall seem practicable, to destroy the ships and tenders above, and to employ the gallies, if they can be of advantage.</P>
<P>The militia for the flying camp come in but slowly. By a return from general Mercer yesterday, they are but little more than three thousand. If they were in, or can be there shortly, and the situation of the enemy remains the same, I would make some efforts to annoy them, keeping our posts here well guarded, and not putting too much to the hazard, or in any manner to the risk.</P>

<P>YOUR favor of the twenty-fourth I received on saturday evening, and, agreeable to your request, shall expunge the pre∣amble to the resolution subjecting the property of subjects to the British crown to forfeiture and confiscation.</P>
<P>Our stock of musket-powder is entirely made up into cart∣ridges. I therefore request that Congress will order four or five tons more of that sort to be immediately forwarded; it be∣ing
<PB N="173" REF="031423_0172_0FEC5A443460F368"/>
not only necessary that we should have more for that purpose, but also some stock to remain in barrels.</P>
<P>Yesterday evening Hutchinson's and Sergeant's regiments from Boston arrived: also two row-gallies from Rhode-Island.—I am fearful the troops have not got entirely clear of the small-pox. I shall use every possible precaution to prevent the infection spread∣ing; and, for that purpose, have ordered them to an encampment separate and detached from the rest.</P>
<P>By saturday's report from Long-Island camp, five ships, a brig, and five schooners had got into the Hook;—by yesterday's, two ships more, and a sloop, were standing in.—What they are, I have not been able to learn.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honored with your two favors of yester∣day's date; and, agreeable to your request, have given Mr. Palfrey liberty to negociate your claim with Mr. Brimmer, and wish it might be satisfied agreeably to you.</P>
<P>I last night received a letter from general Schuyler, a copy of which I do myself the honor to transmit you. You will thereby perceive his reasons for leaving Crown-Point, and pre∣fering the post the council of officers determined to take opposite to Tyconderoga.—I am totally unacquainted with those several posts and the country about them, and therefore cannot determine on the validity of his observations, or think myself at liberty to give any direction on the matter.</P>
<P>Congress will please to observe what he says of their distress for money. From hence he can have no relief, there being on∣ly about three or four thousand dollars in the paymaster's hands according to his return this morning,—and all but two months pay due to the army, besides many other demands,—I could
<PB N="174" REF="031423_0173_0FEC5A47D35FD2D8"/>
wish that proper supplies of money could be always kept:—the want may occasion consequences of an alarming nature.</P>
<P>By a letter from him, of a prior date to the copy inclosed, he tells me that a Mr. Ryckman, who has just returned through the country of the Six-Nations, reports that the Indians who were at Philadelphia have gone home with very favorable ideas of our strength and resources. This he heard in many of their vil∣lages:—a lucky circumstance, if it will either gain their friend∣ship or secure their neutrality.</P>
<P>In my letter of the twenty-seventh I informed Congress of my views to attempt something against the troops on Staten-Is∣land. I am now to acquaint them, that by the advice of gene∣ral Mercer and other officers at Amboy, it will be impractica∣ble to do any thing upon a large scale, for want of craft, and as the enemy have the entire command of water all round the Island.—I have desired general Mercer to have nine or ten flat-bottomed boats built at Newark-bay and Elizabeth-town, with a design principally to keep up the communication across Hackinsac and Passaic rivers, which I deemed a matter of great importance, and extremely necessary to be attended to.</P>
<P>Since I wrote you yesterday, eleven ships more, four brigs, and two sloops, have come into the Hook. I have not yet received Intelligence what any of the late arrivals are: but I suppose we shall not long remain in a state of uncertainty.</P>
<P>Having reason to believe that lord Howe will readily come into an exchange of such prisoners as may be more immediately under his command, and that something will be offered on this subject within a day or two, or rather come in answer to the propositions I have made general Howe, I should be glad to have Congress's interpretation of the resolves of the twenty-se∣cond instant, empowering the commanders to exchange, &amp;c.—whether, by the word <HI>'sailor,'</HI> they mean sailors generally, as well those taken in the vessels of private adventurers by the enemy, as those belonging to the continental cruisers, or vessels in the continent's employ; or whether they only design to extend the exchange to the latter,—those in their particular em∣ploy.</P>
<P>I would also observe, that, heretofore, sailors belonging to merchants ships that have fallen into our hands, and those em∣ployed merely as transports, have not generally been considered as prisoners.—I submit it to Congress whether it may not be now necessary to pass a resolve declaring their sentiments on this subject, and, in general, who are to be treated as prisoners of war, that are taken on board vessels belonging to the sub∣jects
<PB N="175" REF="031423_0174_0FEC5A4AEA253AF8"/>
of the British crown, &amp;c.—The result of their opinion upon the first question proposed, you will please to transmit me by the earliest opportunity.</P>
<P>I have inclosed, for the consideration of Congress, a memo∣rial and petition by captain Holdridge, praying to be relieved against the loss of money stolen from him,—not conceiving my∣self authorised to grant his request. The certificate which at∣tends it proves him to be a man of character; and his case is hard, on his state of it.—Whether making the loss good may not open a door to others, and give rise to applications not so just as his may be, I cannot determine.—That seems to be the only ob∣jection to relieve him.</P>
<P>I am informed by general Putnam that there are some of the Stockbridge Indians here (I have not seen them myself) who express great uneasiness at their not being employed by us, and have come to enquire into the cause. I am sensible Congress had them not in contemplation when they resolved that Indians might be engaged in our service. However, as they seem so anxious,—as they were led to expect it, from what general Schuyler and the other commissioners did,—as we are under difficulties in getting men, and there may be danger of their (or some of them) taking an unfavorable part, I beg leave to submit it as my opinion, under all these circumstances, that they had bet∣ter be employed.</P>

<P>YOUR favor of the thirtieth ultimo, with its several inclo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>res, I was honored with by wednesday's post.</P>
<P>Congress have been pleased to leave with me the direction of colonel Ward's regiment, I have wrote to gevernor Trum∣bull, and requested him to order their march to this place, be∣ing fully satisfied that the enemy mean to make their grand push in this quarter, and that the good of the service requires every aid here that can be obtained. I have also wrote to colonel Elmore, and directed him to repair hither with his regiment.—When it comes, I shall fill up commissions for such officers as appear with their respective companies.</P>
<P>Colonel Holman, with a regiment from the Massachusetts state, is arrived. Colonel Cary from thence is also here, wait∣ing the arrival of his regiment which he hourly expects. He adds when he left New-London he heard that the third regi∣ment

<P>The enemy's force is daily augmenting and becoming stron∣ger by new arrivals. Yesterday general Green reports that about forty sail, including tenders, came into the Hook. What they are, or what those have brought that have lately got in, I remain uninformed. However, I think it probable they are part of lord Howe's fleet, with the Hessian troops:—it is time to look for them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored with your favor of the thirty-first ultimo on friday, with several inclosures; and return you my thanks for the agreeable intelligence you were pleased to communicate, of the arrival of one of our ships with such valuable articles as arms and ammunition; also of the capture made by a priva∣teer.</P>
<P>The mode for the exchange of prisoners, resolved on by Congress, is acceded to by general Howe, so far as it comes within his command. A copy of my letter and his answer upon this subject I have the honor to inclose you; to which I beg leave to refer Congress.</P>
<P>The enclosed copy of a letter from colonel Tupper, who had the general command of the gallies, will inform Congress of the en∣gagement between them and the ships of war up the North-river, on saturday evening, and of the damage we sustained. What in∣jury was done to the ships, I cannot ascertain. It is said they were hulled several times by our shot. All accounts agree that our officers and men, during the whole of the affair, behaved with great spirit and bravery. The damage done the gallies shews beyond question, that they had a warm time of it.—The ships still remain up the river? and, before any thing further can be attempted against them (should it be thought advisable,) the gallies must be repaired.</P>
<P>I have also transmitted Congress a copy of a letter I received by saturday's post from governor Cooke, to which I refer them for the intelligence it contains. The seizure of our vessels by the Portuguese is, I fear, an event too true. Their dependence upon the British crown for aid against the Spaniards must
<PB N="177" REF="031423_0176_0FEC5A50D7AB3FF8"/>
force them to comply with every thing required of them.—I wish the Morris may get safe in with her cargo.—As to the ships captain Buchlin saw on the twenty-fifth ultimo, they are probably arrived: for yesterday twenty-five sail came into the Hook.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, of the twenty-ninth ultimo, he informs me that two of our armed vessels, the day before, had brought into Marblehead a ship bound from Halifax to Staten-Island. She had in about fifteen hundred and nine pounds worth of British goods, besides a good many belonging to tories. A Halifax paper, found on board her, I have enclosed, as also an account sent me by Mr. Hazard, transmitted him by some of his friends, as given by the tories taken in her. The intelligence, I dare say, is true, respecting the arrival of part of the Hessian troops. General Ward in his letter mentions, that, the day this prize was taken, captain Burke, in another of our armed vessels, had an engagement with a ship and a schooner which he thought were transports, and would have taken them, had it not been for an unlucky accident in having his quarter-deck blown up. Two of his men were killed, and several more were wounded.</P>
<P>The hulks and chevaux-de-frise, that have been preparing to obstruct the channel▪ have got up to the place they are intended for, and will be sunk as soon as possible.</P>
<P>I have transmitted Congress a general return of the army in and about this place on the third instant, by which they will perceive the amount of our force.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would beg leave to remind Congress of the necessity there is of having some major-generals appointed for this army, the duties of which are great, extensive, and impossi∣ble to be discharged as they ought and the good of the service re∣quires, without a competent number of officers of this rank. I mean to write more fully upon the subject: and, as things are drawing fast to an issue, and it is necessary to make every proper disposition and arrangement that we possibly can, I pray that this matter may be taken into consideration, and claim their early at∣tention.—I well know what has prevented appointments of this sort for some time past: but the situation of our affairs will not justify longer delays in this instance.—By the first opportunity, I shall take the liberty of giving you my sentiments more at large upon the propriety and necessity of the measure.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of the fifth, which I had the honor of addressing you, I beg leave to recall the attention of Congress to the absolute necessity there is for appointing more general officers,—promising at the same time, by the first opportunity, to give my sentiments more at large upon the subject.</P>
<P>Confident I am that the postponing this measure has not proceed∣ed from motives of frugality: otherwise I should take liberty of attempting to prove that we put too much to the hazard of such a saving.—I am but too well apprised of the difficulties that occur in the choice. They are, I acknowledge, great; but at the same time it must be allowed, they are of such a nature as to present themselves whenever the subject is thought of. Time on the one hand does not remove them; on the other delay may be productive of fatal consequences.</P>
<P>This army, though far short as yet of the numbers intended by Congress, is by much too unwieldy for the command of any one man, without several major-generals to assist. For it is to be observed, that a brigadier-general at the head of his bri∣gade, is no more than a colonel at the head of a regiment, except that he acts upon a larger scale. Officers of more general com∣mand are at all times wanted for the good order and govern∣ment of an army, especially when the army is composed chiefly of raw troops: but in an action they are indispensably neces∣sary.—At present there is but one major-general for this whole department and the flying camp; whereas, at this place alone, less than three cannot discharge the duties with that regularity they ought to be.</P>
<P>If these major-generals are appointed, as undoubtedly they will, out of the present brigadiers, you will want for this place three brigadiers at least.—The northern department will require one, if not two (as general Thompson is a prisoner, and the baron Woedtke reported to be dead o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a state not much better,) there being at present only one brigadier-general (Arnold) in all that department.—For the eastern govern∣ments there ought to be one, or a major-general, to superin∣tend the regiments there, and to prevent impositions that might otherwise be practised.—These make the number wanted to be six or seven: and who are to be appointed, Congress can best judge.</P>
<P>To make brigadiers of the oldest colonels would be the least exceptionable way: but it is much to be questioned, whether by that mode the ablest men would be appointed to office.
<PB N="179" REF="031423_0178_0FEC5A5A438F7408"/>
And I would observe, though the rank of the colonels of the eastern governments was settled at Cambridge last year, it only respected themselves, and is still open as to officers of other governments. To pick a colonel here and a colonel there through the army, according to the opinion entertained of their abilities, would no doubt be the means of making a better choice, and nominating the fittest persons: but then the senior officers would get disgusted, and, more than probable, with their connexions, quit the service.—That might prove fatal at this time.—To appoint gentlemen as brigadiers that had not serv∣ed in this army (in this part of it at least,) would not wound any one in particular, but hurt the whole equally, and must be considered in a very discouraging light by every officer of merit.—View the matter therefore in any point of light you will, there are inconveniencies on the one hand, and difficulties on the other, which ought to be avoided.—Would they be re∣medied by appointing the oldest colonels from each state?—If this mode should be thought expedient, the enclosed list gives the names of the colonels, from New-Hampshire to Pennsylvania inclusive, specifying those who rank first, as I am told, in the se∣veral colony lists.</P>
<P>I have transmitted a copy of a letter from Mr. John Glover, setting forth the nature and grounds of a dispute between him and a Mr. Bradford, respecting their agency, not conceiving myself authorised, nor having the smallest inclination to interfere in any degree in the matter, it is referred to Congress, who will determine and give direction upon it in such manner as they shall judge best. I will only observe, that Mr. Glover was recommended to me as a proper person for an agent, when we first fitted out armed vessels, and was accordingly appointed one; and so far as I know, discharged his office with fidelity and industry.</P>
<P>I received yesterday evening a letter from general Schuyler, con∣taining lieutenant M'Michael's report, who had been sent a scout to Oswego. A copy of the report I have enclosed for the inform∣ation of Congress, lest general Schuyler should have omitted it in his letter which accompanies this. He was at the German-Flatts when he wrote, which was the second instant, and the treaty with the Indians not begun▪ nor had the whole expected, then arrived.—But of these things he will have advised you more fully, I make no doubt.</P>
<P>The paymaster informs me he received a supply of money yesterday. It came very seasonably: for the applications and
<PB N="180" REF="031423_0179_0FEC5A5C101BF278"/>

<P>SINCE closing the letter which I had the honor to write you this morning, two deserters have come in, who left the Solebay man-of-war last evening. One of them is a native of New-York. Their account is that they were in the engagement with colonel Moultrie at Sullivan's Island on the ninth of July—(the particu∣lars they give nearly correspond with the narrative sent by ge∣neral Lee;)—that they left Carolina three weeks ago as a convoy to forty-five transports, having on board general Clinton, lord Cornwallis, and the whole southern army, consisting of about three thousand men, all of whom were landed last week on Sta∣ten-Island in tolerable health;—that, on sunday, thirteen trans∣ports, part of lord Howe's fleet, and having on board Hessians and Highlanders, came to Staten-Island;—that the remainder of the fleet, which was reported to have, in the whole, twelve thou∣sand men, had parted with these troops off the banks of New∣foundland, and were expected to come in every moment;—that they were getting their heavy carriages and cannon on board, had launched eight gondolas with flat-bottoms, and two rafts or stages to carry cannon.</P>
<P>These men understand that the attack will soon be made if the other troops arrive:—that they give out they will lay the Jerseys waste with fire and sword;—that the computed strength of their army will be thirty thousand men. They further add, that when they left Carolina, one transport got on shore, so that they were not able to give her relief; upon which, she surrendered, with five companies of Highlanders, to general Lee, who, after taking every thing valuable out of her, burnt her;—that the admiral turned general Clinton out of his ship after the engagement with a great deal of abuse;—great differences between the principal naval and military gentlemen;—that the ships left in Carolina, are now in such a weakly distressed condition, they would fall an easy prey.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY yesterday morning's post, I was honored with your favor of the second instant, with sundry resolutions of Congress, to which I shall pay strict attention.</P>
<P>As the proposition for employing the Stockbridge Indians has been approved, I have wrote to Mr. Edwards, one of the commis∣sioners, and who lives among them, requesting him to engage them, or such as are willing, to enter the service. I have directed him to indulge them with liberty to join this or the northern army, or both, as their inclinations may lead.</P>
<P>I wish the salutary consequences may result from the regulation respecting seamen taken, that Congress have in view. From the nature of this kind of people, and the privileges granted on their entering into our service, I should suppose many of them will do it.—We want them much.</P>
<P>I yesterday transmitted the intelligence I received from the deserters from the Solebay man-of-war.—The inclosed copy of a letter by last night's post, from the honorable Mr. Bowdoin, with the information of a captain Kennedy lately taken, corro∣borate their accounts respecting the Hessian troops. Indeed his report makes the fleet and armament, to be employed a∣gainst us, greater then we have heard they would be. Howe∣ver, there remains no doubt of their being both large and for∣midable, and such as will require our most vigorous exertions to oppose them. Persuaded of this, and knowing how much inferior our numbers are and will be to theirs when the whole of their troops arrive,—of the important consequences that may and will flow from the appeal that will soon be made—I have wrote to Connecticut and New-Jersey, for all the succour they can afford, and also to the convention of this state.—What I may receive, and in what time, the event must determine. But I would fain hope, the situation and the exigency of our affairs will call forth the most strenuous efforts and early assistance of those who are friends to the cause. I confess there is but too much occasion for their exertions. I confidently trust they will not be withheld.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a copy of a letter from Mr. Bowdoin respect∣ing the eastern Indians. Congress will thereby perceive that they profess themselves to be well attached to our interest,—
<PB N="182" REF="031423_0181_0FEC5A619CB7A770"/>
and the summary of the measures taken to engage them in our service. I have the treaty at large between the honorable council of the Massachusetts, on behalf of the United States, with the delegates of the St. John's and Mikmac tribes. The proba∣bility of a copy's being sent already, and its great length, prevent one coming herewith. If Congress had it not forwarded to them, I will send a copy by the first opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtunity after notice that it has not been received.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 9.—By a report received from general Greene last night, at sunset and a little after, about a hundred boats were seen bringing troops from Staten-Island to the ships, three of which had fallen down towards the Narrows, having taken in soldiers from thirty of the boats. He adds, that, by the best observations of several officers, there appeared to be a general embarkation.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Mercer for two thousand men from the flying camp. Colonel Smallwood's battalion, as part of them, I expect this forenoon: but where the rest are to come from, I know not, as, by the general's last return, not more than three or four hundred of the new levies had got in.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fifth I inclosed a general return of the ar∣my under my immediate command, but I imagine the follow∣ing state will give Congress a more perfect idea, though not a more agreeable one, of our situation, For the several posts on New-York, Long and Governor's Islands, and Paulus-Hook, we have, fit for duty, ten thousand five hundred and fourteen,—sick present, three thousand and thirty-nine—sick absent, six hun∣dred and twenty-nine,—on command, two thousand nine hun∣dred and forty six,—on furlough, ninety-seven,—total, seven∣teen thousand two hundred and twenty-five. In addition to these, we are only certain of colonel Smallwood's battalion in case of an immediate attack. Our posts are too much divid∣ed, having waters between many of them, and some distant from others, fifteen miles. These circumstances, sufficiently distress∣ing of themselves, are much aggravated by the sickness that prevails through the army. Every day more or less are ta∣ken down; so that the proportion of men that may come in can∣not be considered as a real and serviceable augmentation on the whole.</P>
<P>These things are melancholy; but they are nevertheless true. I hope for better.—Under every disadvantage, my utmost exer∣tions shall be employed to bring about the great end we have in view: and, so far as I can judge from the professions and ap∣parant disposition of my troops, I shall have their support. The
<PB N="183" REF="031423_0182_0FEC5A8BB14C1E00"/>
superiority of the enemy and the expected attack do not seem to have depressed their spirits. These considerations lead me to think, that, though the appeal may not terminate so happily in our favor as I could wish, yet they will not succeed in their views without considerable loss. Any advantage they may get, I trust, will cost them dear.</P>
<P><HI>Eight o'clock, A. M.</HI></P>
<P>By the reverend Mr. Madison and a Mr. Johnson, two gentlemen of Virginia who came from Staten-Island yesterday, where they arrived the day before in the packet with colonel Guy Johnson, I am informed that nothing material had taken place in England when they left it;—that there had been a change in the French ministry, which, many people thought, foreboded a war:—that it seemed to be believed by many that Congress would attempt to buy off the foreign troops, and that it might be effected without great difficulty. Their accounts from Staten-Island nearly correspond with what we had before: they say that every preparation is making for an attack;—that the force now upon the Island is about fifteen thousand;—that they appear very impatient for the arrival of the foreign troops, but a very small part having got in. Whether they would at∣tempt any thing before they come, they are uncertain: but they are sure they will as soon as they arrive, if not before.—They say, from what they could collect from the conversation of officers, &amp;c. they mean to hem us in by getting above us and cut∣ting off all communication with the country.</P>
<P>That this is their plan, seems to be corroborated and confirmed by the circumstance of some ships of war going out at different times within a few days past, and other vessels. It is probable that a part are to go round and come up the Sound.</P>
<P>Mr. Madison says lord How's powers were not known when he left England;—that general Conway moved, before his depar∣ture, that they might be laid before the commons; and had his motion rejected by a large majority.</P>

<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the eighth and tenth instant, with the several inclosures. I shall pay attention to the resolution respecting lieutenant Josiah, and attempt to relieve him from his rigorous usage,—Your letters to
<PB N="184" REF="031423_0183_0FEC5A65957F7E88"/>
such of the gentlemen as were here have been delivered. The rest will be sent by the first opportunity.</P>
<P>Since my last of the eighth and ninth, the enemy have made no movements of consequence. They remain nearly in the same state; nor have we any further intelligence of their designs. They have not been yet joined by the remainder of the fleet with the Hessian troops</P>
<P>Colonel Small wood and his battalion got in on friday; and colo∣nel Miles is also here with two battalions more of Pennsylvanian riflemen.</P>
<P>The convention of thir state have been exerting themselves to call forth a portion of their militia to an encampment form∣ing above Kingsbridge, to remain in service for the space of one month after their arrival there; and also half of those in King and Queen's counties, to reinforce the troops on Long-Island till the first of September, unless sooner discharged. General Morris too is to take post with his brigade on the Sound and Hudson's-river for ten days, to annoy the enemy in case they attempt to land; and others of their militia are directed to be in readiness, in case their aid should be required. Upon the whole, from the information I have from the convention, the militia ordered are now in motion, or will be in a little time, and will amount to about three thousand or more. From Connecticut, I am not certain what succours are coming. By one or two gen∣tlemen who have come from thence, I am told some of the militia are assembling, and, from the intelligence they had, would march this week.</P>
<P>By a letter from governor Trumbull, of the fifth, I am advised that the troops from that state, destined for the northern ar∣my, had marched for Skenesborough.—General Ward too, by a letter of the fourth, informs me that the regiments would march from Boston last week, having been cleansed and gen∣erally recovered from the small-pox. I have also countermand∣ed my orders to colonel Elmore, and directed him to join the northern army, having heard, after my orders to Connecticut for his marching hither, that he and most of his regiment were at Albany or within its vicinity,—General Ward mentions that the council of the Massachusetts state will have in from two or three thousand of their militia to defend their lines and different posts, in lieu of the regiments ordered from thence agreeable to the re∣solution of Congress.</P>
<P>The inclosed copy of a resolve of this state, passed the renth instant, will discover the apprehension they are under of the defec∣tion of the inhabitants of Kings' county from the common cause,
<PB N="185" REF="031423_0184_0FEC5A6B4D5A51D8"/>
and of the measures they have taken thereupon. I have directed general Greene to give the committee such assistance as he can, and they may require, in the execution of their com∣mission; though at the same time, I wish the information the convention have received upon the subject may prove ground∣less.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to mention to Congress, that, in a letter I received from general Lee, he mentions the valuable consequences that would result from a number of cavalry being employed in the southern department. Without them (to use his own expressions) he can answer for nothing:—with one thousand he would ensure the safety of those states.—I should have done myself the honor of submitting this matter to Congress before, at his particular request, had it not escaped my mind.—From his acquaintance with that country, and the nature of the grounds, I doubt not he has weighed the matter well and presume he has fully represented the advantages that would arise from the establishment of such a corps—all I mean, is, in compliance with his requisition, to mention the matter, that such consideration may be had upon it (if not already determined) as it may be deserv∣ing of.</P>
<P>I have transmitted a general return, whereby Congress will per∣ceive the whole of our strength, except the two battalions un∣der colonel Miles, which, coming since it was made out, are not included.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a letter just come to hand from Martinique. Congress will please to consider of the purport, favoring me with their answer and a return of the letter.</P>
<P>This moment (ten o'clock) report is made by general Greene that a man-of-war came in yesterday, and that sixty fail of ships are now standing in.—No doubt they are a further part of the Hes∣sian fleet.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on monday, no∣thing of importance has occurred here, except that the enemy have received an augmentation to their fleet, of ninety-six ships:—some reports make them more. In a letter I wrote you yesterday by lieutenant-colonel Reed, I advised you of this: but presuming it may not reach you so soon as this will, I have thought proper to mention the intelligence again.</P>
<P>Inclosed I have the honor to transmit a copy of the exami∣nation of a deserter, sent me this morning by general Mercer,
<PB N="187" REF="031423_0186_0FEC5A732631FFF8"/>
to which I beg leave to refer Congress for the latest accounts I have from the enemy. Whether the intelligence he has given is literally true, I cannot determine: but as to the attack, we daily expect it.</P>
<P>Your favor of the tenth, with its inclosures, was duly received; and I have instructed the several officers who were promoted, to act in their stations as you requested, though their commissions were not sent.</P>
<P>As we are in extreme want of tents and covering for this army,—a great part of those at the out-posts having nothing to shelter them, nor houses to go into,—I submit it to Con∣gress whether it may not be prudent to remand those that were lately sent to Boston, where there are no troops at present; and, if there were, the necessity for them would not be great, as the town, and barracks at several of the posts, would be sufficient to receive them.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter from lieutenant-colonel Henshaw will dis∣cover to Congress his views and wishes, which they will consider and determine on, in whatever way they think right and condu∣cive to the public good; meaning only to lay his letter be∣fore them.</P>
<P>I take the liberty of mentioning that colonel Varnum of Rhode-Island has been with me this morning to resign his commission, conceiving himself to be greatly injured in not having been noticed in the late arrangement and promotion of general officers.—I re∣monstrated against the impropriety of the measure at this time; and he has consented to stay till affairs wear a different aspect from what they do at present.</P>

<P>As the situation of the two armies must engage the attention of Congress, and lead them to expect that each returning day will produce some important events, this is meant to inform them that nothing of moment has yet cast up. In the even∣ing of yesterday there were great movements among their boats; and, from the number that appeared to be passing and re∣passing about the Narrows, we were induced to believe they in∣tended to land a part of their force upon Long-Island: but, having no report from general Greene, I presume they have not done it.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you, that, since I had the pleasure of addressing you yesterday, nothing interesting between the two ar∣mies has happened. Things remain nearly in the situation they then were.</P>
<P>It is with peculiar regret and concern that I have an op∣portunity of mentioning to Congress the sickly condition of our troops. In some regiments there are not any of the field-officers capable of doing duty; in others the duty is extremely dif∣ficult for want of a sufficient number. I have been obliged to nominate some till Congress transmit the appointments of those they wish to succeed to the several vacancies occasioned by the late promotions. This, being a matter of some consequence, I presume will have their early attention, and that they will fill up the several vacancies also mentioned in the list I had the honor of transmitting some few days ago to the board of war.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE circumstances of the two armies having undergone no material alteration since I had the honor of writing to you last, I have nothing particular or important to communicate respecting them.</P>
<P>In my letter of yesterday I forget to mention the arrival of lord Dunmore here. By the examination of captain Hunter (who escaped from the enemy, and came to Amboy on the fourteenth) transmitted me by general Roberdeau, I am cer∣tainly informed his lordship arrived on the thirteenth. The ex∣amination does not say any thing about the ships he brought with him: it only extends to his force, which it mentions to be weak.</P>
<P>I before now expected the enemy would have made their at∣tack: nor can I account for their deferring it, unless the intelli∣gence, given by captain Hunter and another person who escaped about the same time, is the cause,—to wit, that they are waiting the arrival of another division of the Hessian troops, which (they say) is still out. Whether that is the reason of the delay, I can∣not undertake to determine: but I should suppose things will not long remain in their present state.—I have enclosed a copy of gene∣ral Roberdeau's letter, and of the examination of those two persons, which will shew Congress all the information they have given upon these subjects.</P>
<P>I am just now advised by Mr. Aires who came from Phila∣delphia to build the row-gallies, that two of our fire-vessels at∣tempted last night to burn the enemy's ships and tenders up the river. He says that they burned one tender, and one of them boarded the Phoenix, and was grappled with her for near ten minutes; but she cleared herself.—We lost both of the vessels. His account is not so particular as I could wish; however, I am certain the attempt has not succeeded to our wishes. In a little time it is probable the matter will be more minutely re∣ported.</P>

<P>I HAVE been honored with your favor of the sixteenth with the inclosure, and am sorry it is not in my power to trans∣mit Congress a copy of the treaty as they require, having sent it away with the other papers that were in my hands.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="031423_0189_0FEC5A796D67FA48"/>
The resolution they have entered into respecting the foreign troops, I am pursuaded, would produce salutary effects, if it could be properly circulated among them. I fear it will be a matter of difficulty. However I will take every measure that shall appear probable to faciliate the end.</P>
<P>I have the honor to inclose you, for the perusal and consideration of Congress, sundry papers marked No. 1 to No. 7 inclusive, the whole of which, except No. 2 and 7 (my answers to lord Drum∣mond and general Howe) I received yesterday evening by a flag, and to which I beg leave to refer Congress.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly at a loss to know the motives and causes in∣ducing a proceeding of such a nature at this time, and why lord Howe has not attempted some plan of negociation before, as he seems so desirous of it. If I may be allowed to conjecture and guess at the cause, it may be that part of the Hessians have not arrived, as mentioned in the examination transmitted yesterday,—or that general Burgoyne has not made such progress as was ex∣pected, to form a junction of their two armies,—or, what I think equally probable, they mean to procrastinate their operations for some time, trusting that the militias which have come to our succour, will soon become tired and return home, as is but too usual with them.—Congress will make their observations upon these several matters, and favor me with the result as soon as they have done.—They will observe my answer to lord Drummond, who (I am pretty confident) has not attended to the terms of his parole, but has violated it in several instances. It is with the rest of the papers: but, if my memory serves me, he was not to hold any correspondence directly or indirectly with those in arms against us, or to go into any port or harbor in America, where the enemy themselves were or had a fleet, or to go on board their ships.</P>
<P>The treaty with the Indians is in the box which lieutenant-colonel Reed, I presume, has delivered before this. If Con∣gress are desirous of seeing it, they will be pleased to have the box opened. It contains a variety of papers, and all the affairs of the army, from my first going to Cambridge, till it was sent away.</P>
<P>This morning, the Phoenix and Rose men-of-war, with two tenders, availing themselxes of a favorable and brisk wind, came down the river, and have joined the fleet. Our several batteries fired at them in their passage, but without any good effect that I could perceive.</P>

<P>I HAVE nothing of moment to communicate to Congress, as things are in the situation they were in when I had last the honor of addressing them.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, of the twelfth, I find that Whit∣comb's regiment, on the eighth, and Phinney's on the ninth, marched from Boston for Tyconderoga.</P>
<P>Governor Trumbull also, in a letter of the thirteenth, advises me that Ward's regiment in the service of the states was on the march to this army, and that he and his council of safety had in the whole ordered fourteen militia regiments to reinforce us. Three of them have arrived, and amount to about a thousand and twenty men. When the whole come in, we shall be on a much more respectable footing than we have been: but I greatly fear, if the enemy defer their attempt for any considerable time, they will be extremely impatient to return home; and if they should, we shall be reduced to distress again.</P>
<P>He also adds that captain Van Buren, who had been sent for that purpose had procured a sufficient supply of sail-cloth for the vessels to be employed on the lake, and a part of the cor∣dage, in that state: and had a prospect of getting the remain∣der.</P>
<P>As there will be a difficulty in all probability to circulate the papers designed for the foreign troops, and many miscarriages may happen before it can be effected, it may be proper to furnish me with a larger quantity than what I already have.</P>
<P>Inclosed I have the honor to transmit you a general return of our whole force at this time, in which are comprehended the three re∣giments of militia above mentioned. I am sorry it should be so much weakened by sickness. The return will shew you how it distresses us.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday morning favored with yours of the seven∣teenth, accompanied by several resolutions of Congress, and commissions for officers appointed to the late vacancies in this army.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="031423_0191_0FEC5A8553AD79C0"/>
I wrote some days ago to general Schuyler to propose to generals Carleton and Burgoyne an exchange of prisoners in consequence of a former resolve of Congress authorising their commanders in each department to negociate one. That of major Meigs for ma∣jor French, and captain Dearborn's for any officer of equal rank, I submitted to general Howe's consideration, by letter, on the seventeenth, understanding their paroles had been sent him by general Carleton; but have not yet received his answer upon the subject.</P>
<P>In respect to the exchange of the prisoners in Canada, if a proposition on that head has not been already made (and I believe it has not), the inclosed copy of general Carleton's orders (trans∣mitted me under seal by major Bigelow, who was sent with a flag to general Burgoyne from Tyconderoga, with the proceedings of Congress on the breach of capitulation at the Cedars, and the inhuman treatment of our people afterwards) will shew it is un∣necessary, as he has determined to send them to their own provin∣ces, their to remain as prisoners; interdicting at the same time all kind of intercourse between us and his army, except such as may be for the purpose of imploring the king's mercy.—The assassination he mentions, of brigadier-general Gordon, is a fact entirely new to me, and what I never heard of before.—I shall not trouble Congress with my strictures upon this * * * perfor∣mance, * * * only observing that its design is somewhat artful, and that each boatman with major Bigelow was furnished with a copy.</P>
<P>I have also transmitted Congress a copy of the major's journal, to which I beg leave to refer them for the intelligence reported by him on his return from the truce.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Greene yesterday evening, he informed me he had received an express from Hog-Island inlet, advising that five of the enemy's small vessels had appeared at the mouth of the creek, with some troops on board;—also that he had heard two periaguas were off Oyster-Bay,—the whole supposed to be after live stock:—and, to prevent their getting it, he had detached a party of horse, and two hundred and twenty men, among them twenty riflemen. I have not received further intelligence upon the subject.</P>
<P>I am also advised by the examination of a captain Button (master of a vessel that had been taken) transmitted me by ge∣neral Mercer, that the general report among the enemy's troops, when he came off, was, that they were to attack Long-Island, and to secure our works there if possible, at the same time another part of their army was to land above this city.
<PB N="193" REF="031423_0192_0FEC5A876D033950"/>
This information is corroborated by many other accounts, and is probably true: nor will it be possible to prevent them landing on the island, as its great extent affords a variety of places favor∣able for that purpose, and the whole of our works on it are at the end opposite to the city. However, we shall attempt to harrass them as much as possible, which will be all that we can do.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honor to transmit Congress a copy of a let∣ter I received yesterday from governor Livingston, also copies of three reports from colonel Hand.</P>
<P>Though the intelligence reported by the spy on his return to governor Livingston has not been confirmed by the event he menti∣ons (an attack last night,) there is every reason to believe that one is shortly designed. The falling down of several ships yesterday evening to the Narrows, crowded with men,—those succeeded by many more this morning,—and a great number of boats parading around them (as I was just now informed) with troops,—are all circumstances indicating an attack: and it is not improbable it will be made to-day. It could not have happened last night, by reason of a most violent gust.</P>
<P>We are making every preparation to receive them; and I trust, under the smiles of Providence, with our own exertions, that my next, if they do attack, will transmit an account that will be pleasing to every friend of America, and of the rights of human∣ity.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform Congress, that, yesterday morning and in the course of the preceding night, a considerable body of the enemy, amounting by report, to eight or nine thousand, and these all British, landed from the transport-ships mentioned in my last, at Gravesend-bay on Long-Island, and have approached within three miles of our lines, having marched across the low cleared grounds near the woods at Flat-bush, where they are halted, since my last intelligence.</P>
<P>I have detached from hence six battalions as a reinforcement to our troops there, which are all that I can spare at this time, not knowing but the fleet may move up with the remainder of their army, and make an attack here, on the next flood-tide. If they do not, I shall send a further reinforcement, should it be ne∣cessary; and have ordered five battalions more to be in readiness for that purpose.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but a little time will produce some important events. I hope they will be happy.—The reinforcement de∣tached yesterday went off in high spirits; and I have the pleasure to inform you that the whole of the army, that are effec∣tive and capable of duty, discover the same, and great cheerful∣ness.—I have been obliged to appoint major general Sullivan to the command on the island, owing to general Greene's indisposi∣tion;—he has been extremely ill for several days, and still conti∣nues bad.</P>
<P>By wednesday evening's post I received a letter from general Ward, inclosing a copy of the invoice of the ordnance-stores taken by captain Manly, with the appraisement of the same (made in pursuance of my direction, founded on the order of Con∣gress,) which I do myself the honor of transmitting.—You will also receive the treaty between the commissioners and the In∣dians of the Six-Nations, and others, at the German-Flats, which general Schuyler requested me to forward, by his letter of the eighteenth instant.</P>

<P>THE irregularity of the post prevents your receiving the ear∣ly and constant intelligence it is my wish to communicate. This is the third letter which you will probably receive from me by the same post. The first was of little or no consequence:
<PB N="195" REF="031423_0194_0FEC5A8EE5D541C8"/>
but that of yesterday gave you the best information I had been able to obtain, of the enemy's landing and movements upon Long-Island.—Having occasion to go over thither yesterday, I sent my letter to the post-office at the usual hour, being informed that the rider was expected every moment, and would out again di∣rectly: but in the evening when I sent to inquire, none had come in.</P>
<P>I now inclose you a report made to me by general Sullivan after I left Long-Island yesterday. I do not conceive that the enemy's whole force was in motion, but a detached party rather. I have sent over four more regiments, with boats, to be ready either to reinforce the troops under general Sullivan, or to return to this place, if the remainder of the fleet at the watering-place should push up to the city; which hitherto (I mean since the landing upon Long-Island) they have not had in their power to do, on account of the wind which has either been ahead or too small when the tide has served.

<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the twentieth and twenty-fourth, and am happy to find my answer to lord Drum∣mond has met the approbation of Congress. Whatever his views were, most certainly his conduct respecting his parole is highly re∣prehensible.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the twenty-fourth, almost the whole of the enemy's fleet have fallen down to the Narrows; and, from this circumstance, and the striking of their tents at their sev∣eral encampments on Staten-Island from time to time, previous to the departure of the ships from thence, we are led to think they mean to land the main body of their army on Long-Island, and to make their grand push there. I have ordered over consid∣erable reinforcements to our troops there, and shall continue to send more as circumstances may require. There has been a little skirmishing and irregular siring kept up between their and our ad∣vanced guards, in which colonel Martin of the Jersey levies has re∣ceived a wound in his breast, which, it is apprehended, will prove mortal; a private has had his leg broke by a cannon-ball, and another has received a shot in the groin from their musketry. This is all the damage they have yet done us;—what they have sus∣tained, is not known.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="031423_0195_0FEC5A90A0E58240"/>
The shifting and changing the regiments have undergone of late has prevented their making proper returns, and of course put it out of my power to transmit a general one of the army. However, I believe our strength is much the same as it was when the last was made, with the addition of nine militia regiments come from the state of Connecticut, averaging about three hundred and fifty men each. These are nine of the fourteen regiments mentioned in my letter of the nineteenth.—Our people still conti∣nue to be very sickly.</P>
<P>The papers designed for the foreign troops have been put into se∣veral channels, in order that they might be conveyed to them; and, from the information I had yesterday, I have reason to be∣lieve many have fallen into their hands.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a copy of lord Drummonds second letter (in answer to mine) which I received since I transmitted his first, and which I have thought necessary to lay before Congress, that they may possess the whole of the corespondence between us, and see how far he has exculpated himself from the charge alledged against him. The log-book he mentions to have sent colonel Moy∣lay proves nothing in his favor. That shews that he had been at Bermuda, and from thence to some other island, on his pas∣sage from which to this place, the vessel he was in was boarded by a pilot who brought her into the Hook, where he found the British fleet, which his lordship avers he did not expect were there, having understood their destination was to the south∣ward.</P>

<P>I THIS minute return from our lines on Long-Island, where I left his excellency the general. From him I have it in command to inform Congress, that yesterday he went there, and continued till evening, when from the enemy's having landed a considerable part of their forces,—and many of their movements,—there was reason to apprehend they would make in a little time a general attack.—As they would have a wood to pass through before they could approach the lines, it was thought expedient to place a number of men there on the dif∣ferent
<PB N="197" REF="031423_0196_0FEC5A93F7AF62E8"/>
roads leading from where they were stationed, in order to harrass and annoy them in their march.—This being done, early this morning a smart engagement ensued between the enemy and our detachments, which, being unequal to the force they had to contend with, have sustained a pretty considerable loss: at least many of our men are missing. Among those that have not returned, are general Sullivan and lord Sterling. The enemy's loss is not known certainly: but we are told by such of our troops as were in the engagement and have come in that they had many killed and wounded.—Our party brought off a lieutenant, serjeant and corporal, with twenty privates, pri∣soners.</P>
<P>While these detachments were engaged, a column of the enemy descended from the woods, and marched towards the centre of our lines with a design to make an impression, but were repulsed. This evening they appeared very numerous about the skirts of the woods, where they have pitched several tents: and his excellency inclines to think they mean to attack and force us from our lines by way of regular approaches, rather than in any other manner.</P>
<P>To-day five ships of the line came up towards the town, where they seemed desirous of getting, as they turned a long time against an unfavorable wind: and on my return this evening, I found a deserter from the twenty-third regiment, who informed me that they design as soon as the wind will permit them to come up to give us a severe cannonade, and to silence our batteries, if possi∣ble.</P>

I am hopeful, part of our men will yet get in: several did yesterday morning.—That of the enemy is also uncertain: the accounts are various. I incline to think they suf∣fered a good deal. Some deserters say five hundred were killed and wounded.</P>
<P>There were some skirmishing, the greatest part of yesterday, be∣tween parties from the enemy and our people: in the evening it was pretty smart. The event I have not yet learned.</P>
<P>The weather of late has been extremely wet. Yesterday it rained severely the whole afternoon, which distressed our people much,—not having a sufficiency of tents to cover them, and what we have, not being got over yet. I am in hopes they will all be got to day, and that they will be more comfortably pro∣vided, though the great scarcity of these articles distresses us beyond measure, not having any thing like a sufficient number to protect our people from the inclemency of the weather:—which has occasioned much sickness, and the men to be almost broken down.</P>

Since monday, scarce any of us have been out of the lines till our passage along the East-river was effected yesterday morning; and for forty-eight hours preceding that I had hardly been off my horse, and never closed my eyes: so that I was quite unfit to write or dictate till this mor∣ning.</P>
<P>Our retreat was made without any loss of men or ammuniti∣on, and in better order than I expected from troops in the situ∣ation ours were. We brought off all our cannon and stores, ex∣cept a few heavy pieces, which in the condition the earth was by a long-continued rain, we found, upon trial, impracticable. The wheels of the carriages sinking up to the hobs, rendered it
<PB N="199" REF="031423_0198_0FEC5A9E0B611218"/>
impossible for our whole force to drag them.—We left but little provisions on the island, except some cattle which had been driven within our lines, and which after many attempts to force across the water, we found impossible to effect, circumstanced as we were.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a copy of the council of war held previ∣ous to the retreat, to which I beg leave to refer Congress for the reasons, or many of them, that led to the adoption of that mea∣sure.</P>
<P>Yesterday evening and last night, a party of our men were em∣ployed in bringing our stores, cannon, tents, &amp;c. from Govern∣or's-Island, which they nearly completed. Some of the heavy cannon remain there still, but (I expect) will be got away to-day.</P>
<P>In the engagement on the twenty-seventh, generals Sullivan and Sterling were made prisoners. The former has been per∣mitted, on his parole, to return for a little time. From my lord Sterling I had a letter by general Sullivan (a copy of which I have the honor to transmit) that contains his forma∣tion of the engagement with his brigade. It is not so full and certain as I could wish:—he was hurried most probably, as his letter was unfinished:—nor have I been yet able to obtain an ex∣act account of our loss:—We suppose it from seven hundred to a thousand killed and taken.</P>
<P>General Sullivan says lord Howe is extremely desirous of seeing some members of Congress; for which purpose he was allowed to come out, and to communicate to them what has passed between him and his lordship. I have consented to his go∣ing to Philadelphia, as I do not mean, or conceive it right, to withhold, or prevent him from giving, such information as he pos∣sesses in this instance.</P>
<P>I am much hurried and engaged in arranging and making new dispositions of our forces; the movements of the enemy requiring them to be immediately had;—and therefore have only time to add, that I am, with my best regards to Congress, their and your most obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my intelligence of late has been rather unfavorable, and would be received with anxiety and concern, peculiarly hap∣py should I esteem myself, were it in my power at this time to transmit such information to Congress, as would be more pleas∣ing
<PB N="200" REF="031423_0199_0FEC4795C3B6BEA0"/>
and agreeable to their wishes:—but, unfortunately for me,—unfortunately for them,—it is not.</P>
<P>Our situation is truly distressing. The check our detachment sustained on the twenty-seventh ultimo has dispirited too great a proportion of our troops, and filled their minds with appre∣hension and despair. The militia, instead of calling forth their utmost efforts to a brave and manly opposition in order to re∣pair our losses, are dismayed, intractable, and impatient to re∣turn. Great numbers of them have gone off,—in some instan∣ces, almost by whole regiments, by half ones and by companies at a time. This circumstance, of itself, independent of others, when fronted by a well appointed army superior in number to our whole collected force, would be sufficiently disagreeable:—but, when their example has infected another part of the army, when their want of discipline, and refusal of almost every kind of restraint and government, have produced a like conduct but too common to the whole, and an entire disregard of that or∣der and subordination necessary to the well doing of an army, and which had been inculcated before, as well as the nature of our military establishment would admit of,—our condition is still more alarming: and with the deepest concern I am obliged to confess my want of confidence in the generality of the troops.</P>
<P>All these circumstances fully confirm the opinion I ever en∣tertained, and which I more than once in my letters took the liberty of mentioning to Congress, that no dependence could be put in a militia, or other troops than those enlisted and embo∣died for a longer period than our regulations heretofore pre∣scribed. I am persuaded, and as fully convinced as I am of any one fact that has happened, that our liberties must of necessity be greatly hazarded if not entirely lost, if their defence is left to any but a permanent standing army,—I mean, one to exist during the war. Nor would the expense, incident to the support of such a body of troops as would be competent to almost every exigency, far exceed that which is daily incurred by calling in succour, and new enlistments, which, when effected, are not attended with any good consequences. Men who have been free, and subject to no controul, cannot be reduced to order in an instant: and the privileges and exemptions, they claim and will have, influence the conduct of others: and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the disorder, irregularity, and confusion they occasion.</P>
<P>I cannot find that the bounty of ten dollars is likely to pro∣duce the desired effect. When men can get double that sum to
<PB N="201" REF="031423_0200_0FEC5AA3AF3F3700"/>
engage for a month or two in the militia, and that militia fre∣quently called out, it is hardly to be expected.—The addition of land might have a considerable influence on a permanent en∣listment.</P>
<P>Our number of men at present fit for duty is under twenty thousand; they were so by the last returns and best accounts I could get after the engagement on Long-Island; since which, numbers have deserted. I have ordered general Mercer to send the men intended for the flying camp at this place, about a thou∣sand in number, and to try with the militia, if practicable, to make a diversion on Staten-Island.</P>
<P>Till of late, I had no doubt in my own mind, of defending this place; nor should I have yet, if the men would do their du∣ty; but this I despair of. It is painful, and extremely grating to me, to give such unfavorable accounts; but it would be criminal to conceal the truth at so critical a juncture. Every power I pos∣sess shall be exerted to serve the cause; and my first wish is, that whatever may be the event, the Congress will do me the justice to think so.</P>
<P>If we should be obliged to abandon the town, ought it to stand as winter quarters for the enemy? They would derive great incon∣veniences from it on the one hand; and much property would be destroyed on the other.—It is an important question, but will ad∣mit of but little time for deliberation. At present I dare say the enemy mean to preserve it if they can. If Congress therefore should resolve upon the destruction of it, the resolution should be a profound secret, as the knowledge of it will make a capital change in their plans.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the second, our affairs have not undergone a change for the better, nor assumed a more agreeable aspect than what they then wore. The militia under various pretences, of sickness, &amp;c. are daily diminishing; and in a little time, I am persuaded, their number will be very in∣considerable.</P>
<P>On monday night a forty-gun ship passed up the sound be∣tween Governor's and Long-Island, and anchored in Turtle-bay. In her passage she received a discharge of cannon from our batte∣ries, but without any damage; and having a favorable wind and tide, soon got out of their reach. Yesterday morning I
<PB N="102" REF="031423_0201_0FEC5AA6F01C6030"/>
dispatched major Crane of the artillery, with two twelve pounders and a howitzer, to annoy her; who, hulling her several times, forced her from that station, and to take shelter behind an island, where she still continues. There are several other ships of war in the Sound, with a good many transports or store-ships which came round Long-Island, so that the communication is entirely cut off. The admiral with the main body of the fleet, is close in with Gov∣ernor's-Island.</P>
<P>Judging it expedient to guard against every contingency as far as our peculiar situation will admit, and that we may have resources left if obliged to abandon this place, I have sent away and am re∣moving above Kingsbridge all our stores that are unnecessary, and that will not be immediately wanted.</P>
<P>I have enclosed several original letters from some of our officers prisoners at Quebec, which fell into general Gate's hands, and were transmitted by him to general Schuyler who sent them to me. General Gates adds, that the persons who brought them said general Burgoyne had sent messages to the inhabitants upon the lakes, inviting their continuance on their farms and assuring them that they should remain in security.</P>
<P>The post-master having removed his office from the city to Dobb's-ferry, as it is said, makes it extremely inconvenient, and will be the means of my not giving such constant and regular intel∣ligence as I could wish.—Cannot some mode be devised, by which we may have a pretty constant and certain intercourse and commu∣nication kept up? It is an enterprising matter, and of great im∣portance; and, as such, I am persuaded, will meet with due at∣tention from Congress.</P>
<P>I have transmitted the copy of general Gates's letter as sent me by general Schuyler, from which Congress will discover all the in∣formation I have respecting general Burgoyne's message, and my latest intelligence from Tyconderoga, with the returns of the ar∣my there.—Those of the army here it is impossible to obtain, till the hurry and bustle we are now in are a little over.</P>

<P>I WAS last night honored with your favor of the third, with sundry resolutions of Congress: and perceiving it to be their opin∣ion and determination that no damage shall be done the city in case we are obliged to abandon it, I shall take every measure in my power to prevent it.</P>
<P>Since my letter on the fourth, nothing very material has occur∣red, unless it is that the fleet seem to be drawing more to∣gether and all getting close in with Governor's-Island. Their de∣signs we cannot learn; nor have we been able to procure the least information of late, of any of their plans or intended opera∣tions.</P>
<P>As the enemy's movements are very different from what we ex∣pected,—and from their large encampments a considerable dis∣tance up the Sound, there is reason to believe they intend to make a landing above or below Kingsbridge, and thereby to hem in our army, and to cut off the communication with the coun∣try,—I mean to call a council of general officers to-day or to-mor∣row, and endeavor to digest and fix upon some regular and certain system of conduct to be pursued in order to baffle their efforts and counteract their schemes; and also to determine of the expediency of evacuating or attempting to maintain the city and the several posts on this island. The result of their opinion and deliberations I shall advise Congress of by the earliest oppor∣tunity, which will be by express, having it not in my power to communicate any intelligence by post, as the office is removed to so great a distance, and entirely out of the way.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a list of the officers who are prisoners, and from whom letters have been received by a flag.—We know there are others not included in the list.</P>
<P>General Sullivan having informed me that general Howe was willing that an exchange of him for general Prescot should take place, it will be proper to send general Prescot immediately, that it may be effected.</P>
<P>As the militia regiments in all probability will be impatient to return, and become pressing for their pay, I shall be glad of the di∣rection of Congress, whether they are to receive it here or from the conventions or assemblies of the respective states to which they belong. On the one hand, the settlement of their ab∣stracts will be attended with trouble and difficulty: on the other, they will go away much better satisfied, and be more ready to give their aid in future, if they are paid before their de∣parture.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="031423_0203_0FEC5AAD032E29C8"/>
Before I conclude, I must take the liberty of mentioning to Congress the great distress we are in for want of money. Two months pay (and more to some battalions) is now due the troops here, without any thing in the military chest to satisfy it. This occasions much dissatisfaction, and almost a general un∣easiness. Not a day passes without complaints and the most importunate and urgent demands on this head.—As it may injure the service greatly, and the want of a regular supply of cash produce consequences of the most fatal tendency, I en∣treat the attention of Congress to this subject, and that we may be provided as soon as can be, with a sum equal to every pre∣sent claim.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Howe, proposing an exchange of gene∣ral M'Donald for lord Sterling, and shall be extremely hap∣py to obtain it, as well as that of general Sullivan for general Pres∣cot,—being greatly in want of them, and under the necessity of ap∣pointing, protempore, some of the colonels to command bri∣gades.</P>

<P>P. S. As two regiments from North-Carolina and three regi∣ments more from Virginia are ordered here,—if they could embark at Norfolk, &amp;c. and come up the bay with security, it would expedite their arrival, and prevent the men from a long fatiguing march. This however should not be attempted if the enemy have vessels in the bay, which might probably intercept them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the sixth instant, I have called a council of the general officers, in order to take a full and comprehensive view of our situation, and thereupon form such a plan of future defence as may be immediately pursued, and subject to no other alteration than a change of operations on the enemy's side may occasion.</P>
<P>Before the landing of the enemy on Long-Island, the point of attack could not be known, or any satisfactory judgment formed of their intentions. It might be on Long-Island, on Bergen, or directly on the city. This made it necessary to be prepared for each, and has occasioned an expense of labor which now seems useless, and is regretted by those who form a judg∣ment from after knowledge. But I trust, men of disernment will think differently, and see that by such works and preparations we have not only delayed the operations of the campaign till it is too late to effect any capital incursion into the country, but have drawn the enemy's forces to one point and obliged them to [<HI>disclose</HI>] their plan, so as to enable us to form our defence on some certainty.</P>
<P>It is now extremely obvious from all intelligence,—from their movements, and every other circumstance,—that having landed their whole army on Long-Island (except about four thousand on Staten-Island), they mean to inclose us on the island of New-York by taking post in our rear while the shipping effectually secure the front; and thus, either by cutting off our communica∣tion with the country, oblige us to fight them on their own terms, or surrender at discretion,—or by a brilliant stroke en∣deavor to cut this army in pieces, and secure the collection of arms and stores, which they well know we shall not be able soon to replace.</P>
<P>Having therefore their system unfolded to us, it became an im∣portant consideration how it could be most successfully opposed. On every side there is a choice of difficulties: and every mea∣sure on our part (however painful the reflection is from experi∣ence) to be formed with some apprehension that all our troops will not do their duty. In deliberating on this great question, it was impossible to forget, that history, our own experience, the advice of our ablest friends in Europe, the fears of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣my, and even the declarations of Congress, demonstrate, that on our side the war should be defensive—(it has ever been called a war of posts);—that we should on all occasions avoid a gene∣ral
<PB N="206" REF="031423_0205_0FEC5AB5A418B130"/>
action, nor put any thing to the risk, unless compelled by a necessity into which we ought never to be drawn.</P>
<P>The arguments on which such a system was founded were deemed unanswerable; and experience has given her sanction. With these views and being fully persuaded that it would be presumption to draw out her young troops into open ground a∣gainst their superiors both in number and discipline, I have ne∣ver spared the spade and pickaxe. I confess I have not found that readiness to defend even strong posts at all hazards, which is necessary to derive the greatest benefit from them. The ho∣nor of making a brave defence does not seem to be a sufficient stimulus when success is very doubtful, and the falling into the enemy's hands probable: but I doubt not, this will be gradual∣ly attained.—We are now in a strong post, but not an impreg∣nable one, nay, acknowledged by every man of judgment to be untenable, unless the enemy will make the attack upon lines when they can avoid it, and their movements indicate that they mean to do so.</P>
<P>To draw the whole army together in order to arrange the defence proportionate to the extent of lines and works, would leave the country open for an approach, and put the fate of this army and its stores on the hazard of making a successful defence in the city, or the issue of an engagement out of it. On the o∣ther hand, to abandon a city which has been by some deemed defensible, and on whose works much labor has been bestowed, has a tendency to dispirit the troops and enfeeble our cause. It has also been considered as the key to the northern country. But as to that, I am fully of opinion that the establishing of strong posts at Mount-Washington on the upper part of this island, and on the Jersey side opposite to it, with the assistance of the obstruction already made (and which may be improved) in the water, not only the navigation of Hudson's river, but an easier and better communication may be effectually secured between the northern and southern states. This, I believe, every one acquainted with the situation of the country will readily agree to: and it will appear evident to those who have an opportunity of recurring to good maps.</P>
<P>These and many other consequences, which will be involved in the determination of our next measure, have given our minds full employ, and led every one to form a judgment as various objects presented themselves to his view.</P>
<P>The post at Kingsbridge is naturally strong, and is pretty well fortified: the heights about it are commanding, and might soon be made more so. These are important objects, and I have at∣tended
<PB N="207" REF="031423_0206_0FEC5AB8F26AB530"/>
to them accordingly. I have also removed from the city all the store and ammunition except what was absolutely necessary for its defence, and made every other disposition that did not es∣sentially interfere with the object,—carefully keeping in view, until it should be absolutely determined on full consideration, how far the city was to be defended at all events.</P>
<P>In resolving points of such importance, many circumstances peculiar to our own army also occur. Being only provided for a summer's campaign, their clothes, shoes, and blankets, will soon be unfit for the change of weather which we every day feel. At present we have not tents for more than two-thirds, many of them old and worn out: but if we had a plentiful supply, the sea∣son will not admit of continuing in them long.—The case of our sick is also worthy of much consideration. Their number, by the returns, forms at least one-fourth of the army. Policy and humanity require they should be made as comfortable as possible.</P>
<P>With these, and many other circumstances before them, the whole council of general officers met yesterday in order to adopt some general line of conduct to be pursued at this important crisis. I intended to have procured their separate opinions on each point; but time would not admit. I was therefore obliged to collect their sense more generally than I could have wished.—All agreed the town would not be tenable if the enemy resolved to bombard and cannonade it; but the difficulty attending a removal operated so strongly, that a course was taken between abandoning it totally and concentring our whole strength for its defence: nor were some a little influenced in their opinions to whom the determination of Congress was known, against an evacuation totally, as they were led to suspect Congress wished it to be maintained at every hazard.</P>
<P>It was concluded to arrange the army under three divisions;—five thousand to remain for the defence of the city;—nine thousand to Kingsbridge and its dependencies, as well to possess and secure those posts, as to be ready to attack the enemy who are moving eastward on Long-Island, if they should attempt to land on this side;—the remainder to occupy the intermediate space, and support either;—that the sick should be immediately removed to Orange-town, and barracks prepared at Kingsbridge with all expedition to cover the troops.</P>
<P>There were some general officers, in whose judgment and opi∣nion much confidence is to be reposed, that were for a total and immediate removal from the city;—urging the great danger of one part of the army being cut off before the other can support
<PB N="208" REF="031423_0207_0FEC5ABA8F379588"/>
it, the extremities being at least sixteen miles apart;—that our army, when collected, is inferior to the enemy;—that they can move with their whole force to any point of attack, and con∣sequently must succeed by weight of numbers, if they have on∣ly a part to oppose them;—that, by removing from hence, we deprive the enemy of the advantage of their ships, which will make at least one half of the force to attack the town;—that we should keep the enemy at bay, put nothing to the hazard, but at all events keep the army together, which may be recruited another year;—that the unspent stores will also be preserved; and, in this case, the heavy artillery can also be secured. But they were over∣ruled by a majority, who thought for the present a part of our force might be kept here, and attempt to maintain the city a while longer.</P>
<P>I am sensible a retreating army is incircled with difficulties: that the declining an engagement subjects a general to reproach; and that the common cause may be affected by the discourage∣ment it may throw over the minds of many. Nor am I insensible of the contrary effects, if a brilliant stroke could be made with any probability of success, especially after our loss upon Long∣Island. But, when the fate of America may be at stake on the issue,—when the wisdom of cooler moments and experienced men have decided that we should protract the war, if possible,—I can∣not think it safe or wise to adopt a different system when the season for action draws so near a close.</P>
<P>That the enemy mean to winter in New-York, there can be no doubt:—that, with such an armament they can drive us out, is equally clear.—The Congress having resolved that it should not be destroyed, nothing seems to remain, but to determine the time of their taking possession. It is our interest and wish to prolong it as much as possible, provided the delay does not affect our future measures.</P>
<P>The militia of Connecticut is reduced, from six thousand, to less than two thousand, and in a few days will be merely nominal. The arrival of some Maryland troops, &amp;c. from the flying camp, has in a great degree supplied the loss of men: but the ammunition they have carried away will be a loss sensibly felt. The impulse for going home was so irresistible, it answered no purpose to oppose it. Though I would not discharge, I have been obliged to ac∣quiesce; and it affords me more melancholy proof, how delusive such dependencies are.</P>
<P>Inclosed I have the honor to transmit a general return, the first I have been able to procure for some time; also a report of captain Newell from our works at Horn's hook or Hell∣gate.
<PB N="209" REF="031423_0208_0FEC5AE2E49A2DA0"/>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday honored with your favor of the eighth instant, accompanied by several resolutions of Congress, to which I shall pay the strictest attention, and, in the instances required, make them the future rule of my conduct.</P>
<P>The mode of negociation pursued by lord Howe I did not approve of: but as general Sullivan was sent out upon the bu∣siness, and with a message to Congress, I could not conceive myself at liberty to interfere in the matter, as he was in the character of a prisoner, and totally subject to their power and direction.</P>
<P>The list of prisoners, before omitted through hurry, is now inclosed; though it will probably have reached Congress before this.—I shall write by the first opportunity for major Hawsakse to repair to Philadelphia—(he is in the northern army);—and will also mention the several appointments in consequence of colonel St. Clair's promotion.</P>
<P>As soon as generals Prescot and M'Donald arrive, I shall take measures to advise general Howe of it, that the proposed ex∣change for general Sullivan and lord Sterling may be carried into execution.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the eighth, nothing material has occurred, except that the enemy have possessed themselves of Monte∣zore's-Island, and landed a considerable number of troops upon it. This island lies in the mouth of Hearlem-river, which runs out of the Sound into the North-river, and will give the ene∣my an easy opportunity of landing either on the low grounds of Morrisania, if their views are to seize and possess the passes above Kingsbridge, or on the plains of Haerlem, if they design to intercept and cut off the communication between our several posts. I am making every disposition and arrangement that the divided state of our troops will admit of, and which appear most likely and the best calculated to oppose their attacks; for I presume there will be several.—How the event will be, God only knows; but you may be assured that nothing in my power,
<PB N="210" REF="031423_0209_0FEC5ABE2E94BA78"/>
circumstanced as I am, shall be wanting, to effect a favorable and happy issue.</P>
<P>By my letter of the eighth you would perceive that several of the council were for holding the town, conceiving it practi∣cable for some time. Many of them now, upon seeing our di∣vided state, have altered their opinion, and allow the expedi∣ency and necessity of concentring our whole force, or draw∣ing it more together. Convinced of the propriety of this mea∣sure, I am ordering our stores away, except such as may be absolutely necessary to keep as long as our troops remain; that, if an evacuation of the city becomes inevitable (which certainly must be the case), there may be as little to remove as possible.</P>
<P>The inclosed packet contains several letters for particular mem∣bers of Congress and for some gentlemen in Philadelphia. They came to hand yesterday, and were brought from France by a captain Levez lately arrived at Bedford in the Massachusetts state. I must request the favor of you to open the packet, and to have the letters put in a proper channel of conveyance to the gentlemen they are addressed to.</P>

<P>HIS excellency being called from head-quarters to-day on business of importance which prevents his writing, I therefore do myself the honor to inform Congress of what has happened since his letter of yesterday.</P>
<P>Last evening the enemy transported a number of men from Buchanan's to Montezore's island, and by their several move∣ments, more strongly indicate their intention to land somewhere about Haerlem or Morrisania,—most likely, at both at the same time. This morning one of the ships that have been for some time in the Sound moved down towards Hell-gate; but, the tide leaving her, she could not get near enough to bring her guns to bear upon our fortification. If she means to attack it, it is probable she will warp in the next tide. Their batte∣ries have kept up a pretty constant fire against ours at that place, but without any considerable effect. This morning they opened a new one.</P>

I could wish to maintain it, because I know it to be of importance; but I am fully con∣vinced that it cannot be done, and that an attempt for that purpose, if persevered in, might and most certainly would be attended with consequences the most fatal and alarming in their nature.</P>
<P>Sensible of this, several of the general officers, since the de∣termination of the council mentioned in my last, petitioned that a second council might be called to reconsider the propositions which had been before them upon the subject. Accordingly I called one on the twelfth, when a large majority not only de∣termined a removal of the army prudent, but absolutely neces∣sary,—declaring they were entirely convinced from a full and minute enquiry into our situation, that it was extremely peril∣ous; and, from every movement of the enemy, and the intel∣ligence received, their plan of operations was to get in our rear, and, by cutting off the communication with the main, ob∣lige us to force a passage through them on the terms they wish, or to become prisoners in some short time for want of necessary supplies of provision.</P>
<P>We are now taking every method in our power to remove the stores, &amp;c. in which we find almost insuperable difficulties. They are so great and so numerous, that I fear we shall not ef∣fect the whole before we meet with some interruption.—I fully expected that an attack somewhere would have been made last night. In that I was disappointed; and happy shall I be, if my apprehensions of one to-night, or in a day or two, are not confirmed by the event. If it is deferred a little while longer, I flatter myself all will be got away, and our force be more concentred, and of course more likely to resist them with suc∣cess.</P>
<P>Yesterday afternoon, four ships of war, two of forty and two of twenty-eight guns went up the East-river, passing between Governor's and Long-Island, and anchored about a mile above the city, opposite Mr. Srivansent's, where the Rose man-of-war was lying before. The design of their going not being certainly known, gives rise to various conjectures,—some sup∣posing they are to cover the landing of a party of the enemy a∣bove the city,—others that they are to assist in destroying our
<PB N="212" REF="031423_0211_0FEC5AC89291E800"/>
battery at Horn's-hook, that they may have a free and un-in∣terrupted navigation in the Sound. It is an object of great im∣portance to them, and what they are industriously trying to ef∣fect by a pretry constant cannonade and bombardment.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would beg leave to mention to Con∣gress, that the pay now allowed to nurses for their attendance on the sick is by no means adequate to their services; the con∣sequence of which is, that they are extremely difficult to procure; in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed they are not to be got; and we are under the necessity of substituting in their place a number of men from the respective regiments, whose service by that means is entirely lost in the proper line of their duty, and but little benefit rendered to the sick. The officers I have talked with upon the subject all agree that they should be allowed a dollar per week, and that for less they cannot be had.</P>
<P>Our sick are extremely numerous, and we find their removal attended with the greatest difficulty. It is a matter that em∣ploys much of our time and care; and what makes it more dis∣tressing is the want of proper and convenient places for their reception.—I fear their sufferings will be great and many. How∣ever, nothing on my part, that humanity or policy can require, shall be wanting to make them comfortable, so far as the state of things will admit of.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON saturday, about sunset, six more of the enemy's ships, one or two of which were men-of-war passed between Gover∣nor's-Island and Red-hook, and went up the East-river to the station taken by those mentioned in my last. In half an hour I received two expresses,—one from colonel Serjeant at Horn's∣hook [Hell-gate] giving an account that the enemy, to the a∣mount of three or four thousand, had marched to the river, and were embarking for Barns's or Montezore's-island, where num∣bers of them were then encamped:—the other from general Misslin, that uncommon and formidable movements were disco∣vered among the enemy; which being confirmed by the scouts I had sent out, I proceeded to Haerlem, where it was supposed (or at Morrisania opposite to it) the principal attempt to land would be made. However, nothing remarkable happened that
<PB N="213" REF="031423_0212_0FEC5ACE16A21140"/>
night: but in the morning they began their operations. Three ships of war came up the North-river as high as Bloomingdale, which put a total stop to the removal, by water, of any more of our provision, &amp;c. and about eleven o'clock those in the East-river began a most severe and heavy cannonade, to scour the grounds, and cover the landing of their troops between Turtle-bay and the city, where breast works had been thrown up to oppose them.</P>
<P>As soon as I heard the siring, I rode with all possible dispatch towards the place of landing, when, to my great surprise and mor∣tification, I found the troops that had been posted in the lines retreating with the utmost precipitation, and those ordered to support them (Parsons and Fellows's brigades) flying in every direction, and in the greatest confusion, notwithstanding the exertions of the generals to form them. I used every means in my power to rally and get them into some order: but my at∣tempts were fruitless and ineffectual; and on the appearance of a small party of the enemy, not more than sixty or seventy, their disorder increased, and they ran away in the greatest confusion, without firing a single shot.</P>
<P>Finding that no confidence was to be placed in these brigades, and apprehending that another party of the enemy might pass over to Haerlem plains and cut off the retreat to this place, I sent orders to secure the heights in the best manner with the troops that were stationed on and near them; which being done, the retreat was effected with but little or no loss of men, though of a considerable part of our baggage,—occasioned by this disgraceful and dastardly conduct, Most of our heavy cannon, and a part of our stores and provisions which we were about removing, was unavoidably left in the city, though every means (after it had been determined in council to evacuate the post) had been used to prevent it.</P>
<P>We are now encamped with the main body of the army on the heights of Haerlem, where I should hope the enemy would meet with a defeat in case of an attack, if the generality of our troops would behave with tolerable bravery. But experience, to my extreme affliction, has convinced me that this is rather to be wished for than expected. However, I trust that there are many who will act like men, and shew themselves worthy of the blessings of freedom.</P>
<P>I have sent out some reconnoitring parties to gain intelligence, if possible, of the disposition of the enemy, and shall inform Con∣gress of every material event by the earliest opportunity.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my letter of the sixteenth contained intelligence of an im∣portant nature, and such as might lead Congress to expect that the evacuation of New-York and retreat to the heights of Haer∣lem, in the manner they were made, would be succeeded by some other interesting event, I beg leave to inform them that as yet nothing has been attempted upon a large and general plan of attack.</P>
<P>About the time of the post's departure with my letter, the ene∣my appeared in several large bodies upon the plains about two and a half miles from hence. I rode down to our advanced posts, to put matters in a proper situation if they should attempt to come on, When I arrived there I heard a firing, which, I was informed, was between a party of our rangers under the command of lieutenant-colonel Knolton, and an advanced party of the enemy. Our men came in and told me that the body of the enemy, who kept themselves concealed, consisted of a∣bout three hundred as near as they could guess, I immedi∣ately ordered three companies of colonels Weedon's regiment from Virginia, under the command of major Leitch, and colonel Knol∣ton with his rangers composed of volunteers from different New-England regiments, to try to get in their rear, while a disposition was making as if to attack them in front, and thereby draw their whole attention that way.</P>
<P>This took effect as I wished on the part of the enemy. On the appearance of our party in front, they immediately ran down the hill, took possession of some fences and bushes, and a smart firing began, but at too great a distance to do much execution on either side. The parties under colonel Knolton and major Leitch unluc∣kily began their attack too soon, as it was rather in flank than in rear.—In a little time major Leitch was brought off wounded, having received three balls through his side; and, in a short time after, colonel Knolton got a wound which proved mortal. Their men, however, persevered, and continued the engagement with the greatest resolution.</P>
<P>Finding that they wanted a support, I advanced part of colonel Griffith's and colonel Richardsons's Maryland regiments, with some detachments from the eastern regiments who were near∣est the place of action. These troops charged the enemy with great intrepidity, and drove them from the wood into the plain, and were pushing them from thence (having silenced
<PB N="215" REF="031423_0214_0FEC5AD2D0E804A8"/>
their fire in a great measure) when I judged it prndent to order a retreat, fearing the enemy (as I have since found was really the case) were sending a large body to support their party.</P>
<P>Major Leitch, I am in hopes, will recover: but colonel Knol∣ton's fall is much to be regretted, as that of a brave and good offi∣cer.—We had about forty wounded: the number of slain is not yet ascertained: but it is very inconsiderable.</P>
<P>By a serjeant who deserted from the enemy and came in this morning, I find that their party was greater than I imagined. It consisted of the second battalion of light infantry, a battalion of the Royal Highlanders, and three companies of Hessian ri∣flemen, under the command of brigadier-general Leslie. The deserter reports that their loss in wounded and missing was eighty-nine, and eight killed. In the latter, his account is too small, as our people discovered and buried double that number. This affair, I am in hopes, will be attended with many salutary consequences, as it seems to have greatly inspired the whole of our troops.—The serjeant further adds that a considerable body of men are now encamped from the East to the North river, between the seven and eight mile stones, under the command of general Clinton.—General Howe, he believes, has his quarters at Mr. Apthorp's house.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you yesterday, nothing material has occurred. However, it is probable in a little time the enemy will attempt to force us from hence, as we are informed they are bringing many of their heavy cannon to∣wards the the heights and the works we have thrown up. They have also eight or nine ships of war in the North-river, which

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honored with your favor of the sixteenth with its inclosures.—To prevent the injury and abuses which would arise from the militia and other troops carrying away ammunition and continental property, I have published the substance of the resolves upon the subject in general orders.</P>
<P>Since my letter of yesterday, nothing of importance has cast up. The enemy are forming a large and extensive encampment in the plains mentioned in my last, and are busily employed in transport∣ing their cannon and stores from Long-Island. As they advance them this way, we may reasonably expect their operations will not long be deferred.</P>
<P>Inclosed are sundry letters, &amp;c. to which Congress will be pleas∣ed to pay such regard as they may think them deserving of. The letter from monsieur . . . . . came open under cover of one to me.—Those from colonel Hand and colonel Ward con∣tain a list of vacancies in their regiments, and of the persons they esteem proper to fill them. The former, I believe, returned no list before: the latter says he never got any commissions.—Generals Howe and Erskine's proclamation shew the measures that have been pursued, to force and seduce the inhabitants of Long∣Island from their allegiance to the states, and to assist in their des∣truction.</P>
<P>As the period will soon arrive, when the troops composing the present army (a few excepted) will be disbanded according to the tenor of their enlistments, and the most fatal consequen∣ces may cause if a suitable and timely provision is not made in this instance, I take the liberty of suggesting to Congress not on∣ly the expediency but the absolute necessity there is that their earliest attention should be had to this subject. In respect to the time that troops should be engaged for, I have frequently given my sentiments; nor have I omitted to express my opinion of the difficulties that will attend raising them, nor of the
<PB N="217" REF="031423_0216_0FEC5ADD311EA178"/>
impracticability of effecting it without the allowance of a large and extraordinary bounty.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy and painful consideration to those who are concerned in the work and have the command, to be forming ar∣mies constantly, and to be left by troops just when they begin to deserve the name, or perhaps at a moment when an impor∣tant blow is expected. This, I am informed, will be the case at Tyconderoga, with part of the troops there, unless some system is immediately come into, by which they can be induced to stay. General Schuyler tells me in a letter received yesterday, that De Haas's, Maxwell's, and Wind's Regiments stand en∣gaged only till the beginning of next month, and that the men, he is fearful, will not remain longer than the time of their enlistments.</P>
<P>I would also beg leave to mention to Congress, that the season is fast approaching when clothes of every kind will be wanted for the army. Their distress is already great, and will be increased as the weather becomes more severe. Our situation is now bad, but it is much better than that of the militia that are coming to join us from the states of the Massachusetts-Bay and Connecticut, in consequence of the requisition of Congress. They, I am informed, have not a single tent, or a necessary of any kind; nor can I conceive how it will be possible to support them. These circumstances are extremely alarming, and oblige me to wish Congress to have all the tents, cloathing of ev∣ery kind, and camp necessaries, provided and forwarded, that are to be procured. These eastern reinforcements have not a single necessary, not a pan or a kettle,—in which we are now greatly deficient.—It is with reluctance that I trouble Congress with these matters: but to whom can I resort for relief unless to them? The necessity therefore, which urges the application, will excuse it, I am persuaded.</P>
<P>I have not been able to transmit Congress a general return of the army this week, owing to the peculiar situation of our af∣fairs, and the great shifting and changing among the troops. As soon as I can procure one, a copy shall be forwarded to Congress.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the hours alloted to sleep I will borrow a few mo∣ments to convey my thoughts on sundry important matters to Con∣gress. I shall offer them with the sincerity which ought to cha∣racterize a man of candor, and with the freedom which may be used in giving useful information without incurring the imputation of presumption.</P>
<P>We are now, as it were, upon the eve of another dissolution of our army. The remembrance of the difficulties which happened upon the occasion last year,—the consequences which might have followed the change if proper advantages had been ta∣ken by the enemy,—added to a knowledge of the present temper and situation of the troops,—reflect but a very gloo∣my prospect upon the appearances of things now, and satisfy me beyond the possibility of doubt, that, unless some speedy and ef∣fectual measures are adopted by Congress, our cause will be lost.</P>
<P>It is in vain to expect that any or more than a trifling part of this army will again engage in the service on the encouragement offered by Congress. When men find that their townsmen and companions are receiving twenty, thirty, and more dol∣lars, for a few months' service (which is truly the case), it cannot be expected, without using compulsion: and to force them into the service would answer no valuable purpose. When men are irrita∣ted, and the passions inflamed, they fly hastily and cheerful∣ly to arms: but after the first emotions are over * * *, a soldier, reasoned with upon the goodness of the cause he is engaged in and the inestimable rights he is contending for, hears you with patience, and acknowledges the truth of your observa∣tions, but adds that it is of no more importance to him than others. The officer makes you the same reply, with this further remark, that his pay will not support him, and he cannot ruin himself and family to serve his country, when every member of the community is equally interested, and benefitted by his la∣bors. * * *</P>
<P>It becomes evidently clear then, that, as this contest is not likely to be the work of a day, as the war must be carried on sys∣tematically,—and to do it you must have good officers,—there are, in my judgment, no other possible means to obtain them but by establishing your army upon a permanent footing, and giving your officers good pay. This will induce gentlemen and
<PB N="220" REF="031423_0219_0FEC5AE8180B2E90"/>
men of character to engage: and till the bulk of your officers are composed of such persons as are actuated by principles of honor and a spirit of enterprise, you have little to expect from them. They ought to have such allowances as will enable them to live like and support the character of gentleman. * * * Besides something is due to a man who puts his life in [<HI>your</HI>] hands, hazards his health, and forsakes the sweets of do∣mestic enjoyment.—Why a captain in the continental service should receive no more than five shillings currency per day for per∣forming the same duties that an officer of the same rank in the British service receives ten shillings sterling for, I never could conceive, especially when the latter is provided with every necessary he requires upon the best terms, and the former can scarce procure them at any rate. There is nothing that gives a man consequence and renders him fit for command, like a sup∣port that renders him independent of every body but the state he serves.</P>
<P>With respect to the men, nothing but a good bounty can obtain them upon a permanent establishment: and for no shorter time than the continuance of the war, ought they to be engaged; as facts incontestibly prove that the difficulty and cost of en∣listments increase with time.—When the army was first rais∣ed at Cambridge, I am persuaded the men might have been got, without a bounty for the war. After this, they began to see that the contest was not likely to end so speedily as was imagined, and to feel their consequence by remarking, that, to get in the mili∣tia in the course of the last year, many towns were induced to give them a bounty.</P>
<P>Foreseeing the evils resulting from this, and the destructive consequences which unavoidably would follow short enlistments, I took the liberty in a long letter (date not now recollected, as my letter-book is not here) to recommend the enlistments for and during the war, assigning such reasons for it as experience has since convinced me were well founded. At that time, twen∣ty dollars would, I am persuaded, have engaged the men for this term. But it would not do to look back: and, if the present opportunity is slipped, I am persuaded that twelve months more will increase our difficulties four-fold. I shall therefore take the freedom of giving it as my opinion, that a good bounty be immediately offered, aided by the proffer of at least a hundred or a hundred and fifty acres of land, and a suit of clothes and blanket to each non-commissioned officer and soldier; as I have good athority for saying, that, however high the men's pay may appear, it is barely sufficient, in the present scarcity and
<PB N="221" REF="031423_0220_0FEC5AEA4CF5DF00"/>
dearness of all kinds of goods, to keep them in clothes, much less afford support to their families.</P>
<P>If this encouragement then is given to the men, and such pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlemen of character and liberal sentiments to engage, and proper care and precaution used in the nomination (having more regard to the characters of persons than the number of men they can enlist), we should in a little time have an army able to cope with any that can be opposed to it, as there are excellent materials to form one out of. But while the only merit an officer possesses is his ability to raise men, while those men consider and treat him as an equal, (and in the character of an officer) regard him no more than a broom-stick, being mixed to∣gether as one common herd,—no order nor discipline can prevail; nor will the officer ever meet with that respect which is essentially necessary to due subordination.</P>
<P>To place any dependence upon a militia is assuredly resting up∣on a broken staff,—men just dragged from the tender scenes of domestic life,—unaccustomed to the din of arms,—totally un∣acquainted with every kind of military skill; which being followed by a want of confidence in themselves, when opposed to troops regularly trained, disciplined, and appointed, superior in know∣ledge and superior in arms, makes them timid and ready to fly from their own shadows. Besides, the sudden change in their manner of living (particularly in the lodging) brings on sickness in many, impatience in all, and such an unconquerable desire of re∣turning to their respective homes, that it not only produces shame∣ful and scandalous desertions among themselves, but infuses the like spirit into others.</P>
<P>Again, men accustomed to unbounded freedom and no control, cannot brook the restraint which is indispensably necessary to the good order and government of an army; without which, licentious∣ness and every kind of disorder triumphantly reign.—To bring men to a proper degree of subordination is not the work of a day, a month, or even a year: and, unhappily for us and the cause we are engaged in, the little discipline I have been laboring to establish in the army under my immediate command is in a manner done away by having such a mixture of troops as have been called toge∣ther within these few months.</P>
<P>Relaxed and unfit as our rules and regulations of war are for the government of an army, the militia (those properly so cal∣led; for of these we have two sorts, the six-months-men and those sent in as a temporary aid) do not think themselves sub∣ject to them, and therefore take liberties which the soldier is punished for. This creates jealousy: jealousy begets dissatis∣faction;
<PB N="222" REF="031423_0221_0FEC5AEFC4FFA9C0"/>
and these by degrees ripen into mutiny, keeping the whole army in a confused and disordered state,—rendering the time of those who wish to see regularity and good order prevail, more unhappy than words can describe. Besides this, such re∣peated changes take place, that all arrangement is set at nought, and the constant fluctuation of things deranges every plan as fast as adopted.</P>
<P>These, sir, Congress may be assured, are but a small part of the inconveniencies which might be enumerated, and attributed to militia: but there is one that merits particular attention, and that is the expense. Certain I am, that it would be cheaper to keep fifty or a hundred thousand in constant pay, than to de∣pend upon half the number and supply the other half occasion∣ally by militia. The time the latter are in pay before and after they are in camp, assembling and marching—The waste of am∣munition, the consumption of stores, which in spite of every re∣solution or requisition of Congress, they must be furnished with, or sent home,—added to other incidental expenses consequent upon their coming and conduct in camp,—surpasses all idea, and destroys every kind of regularity and economy which you could establish among fixed and settled troops, and will, in my opinion prove (if the scheme is adhered to) the ruin of our cause.</P>
<P>The jealousies of a standing army, and the evils to be appre∣hended from one, are remote, and, in my judgment, situated and circumstanced as we are, not at all to be dreaded: but the consequence of wanting one, according to my ideas formed from the present view of things, is certain and inevitable ruin. For, if I was called upon to declare upon oath, whether the militia have been most serviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I should subscribe to the latter. I do not mean by this, however, to arraign the conduct of Congress: in so doing I shall equally condemn my own measures, if I did not my judgment: but ex∣perience, which is the best criterion to work by, so fully, clear∣ly and decisively reprobates the practice of trusting to militia, that no man who regards order, regularity and economy, or who has any regard for his own honor, character, or peace of mind, will risk them upon this issue. * * *</P>
<P>An army formed of good officers moves like clock-work; but there is no situation upon earth less enviable nor more distress∣ing than that person's who is at the head of troops who are regardless of order and discipline, and who are unprovided with almost every necessary. In a word the difficulties which have for ever surrounded me since I have been in the service, and
<PB N="223" REF="031423_0222_0FEC5AF58E1D0598"/>
kept my mind constantly upon the stretch,—the wounds which my feelings (as an officer) have received by a thousand things which have happened contrary to my expectation and wishes, * * *—added to a consciousness of my inability to govern an army composed of such discordant parts, and under such a vari∣ety of intricate and perplexing circumstances,—induce not only a belief, but a thorough conviction in my mind, that it will be impossible (unless there is a thorough change in our military system) for me to conduct matters in such a manner as to give satisfaction to the public, which is all the recompence I aim at, or even wished for.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I must apoligise for the liberties taken in this letter, and for the blots and scratchings therein, not having time to give it more correctly.—With truth I can add, that, with every sentiment of respect and esteem, I am yours and the Con∣gress's most obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>HAVING wrote you fully on sundry important subjects this morning, as you will perceive by the letter which accom∣panies this, I mean principally now to inclose a copy of a letter received from general Howe on sunday morning, with the lists of the prisoners in his hands,—of those in our possession belong∣ing to the army immediately under his command,—and of my answer, which were omitted to be put in the other.

They will please to determine how he is to be ranked in fu∣ture.</P>
<P>The number of prisoners according to these returns is great∣er than what we expected. However, I am inclined to believe, that, among those in the list from Long-Island, are several mi∣litia of general Woodhull's party, who were never arranged in this army.—As to those taken on the fifteenth, they greatly exceed the number that I supposed fell into their hands in the retreat from the city. At the time that I transmitted an ac∣count of that affair, I had not obtained returns, and took the matter upon the officers' reports. They are difficult to get with certainty at any time.—In the skirmish of monday se'nnight, they could have taken but very few.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="031423_0223_0FEC5AF7206AFB10"/>
Before I conclude, I shall take occasion to mention that those returns made with such precision, and the difficulty that will attend the proposed exchange on account of the dispersed and scattered state of the prisoners in our hands, will clearly evince the necessity of appointing commissaries and proper persons to superintend and conduct in such instances. This I took the liberty of urging more than once, as well on account of the propriety of the measure and the saving that would have resulted from it, as that the prisoners might be treated with humanity, and have their wants particularly attended to.</P>
<P>I would also observe, (as I esteem it my duty) that this ar∣my is in want of almost every necessary,—tents, camp kettles, blankets, and clothes of all kinds. But what is to be done with respect to the two last articles, I know not, as the term of enlist∣ment will be nearly expired by the time they can be provided. This may be exhibited as a further proof of the disadvantages attending the levying of an army upon such a footing as never to know how to keep them without injuring the public or incom∣moding the men.—I have directed the colonel or commanding officer of each corps to use his endeavors to procure such clothing as is absolutely necessary: but at the same time I confess, that I do not know how they are to be got.</P>

<P>I received yesterday the inclosed declaration by a gentleman from Elizabeth-Town, who told me many copies were found in the possession of the soldiers from Canada, that were landed there a day or two ago by general Howe's permission.

<P>BEING about to cross the North river this morning in order to view the post opposite, and the grounds between that and Paulus Hook, I shall not add much more than that I have been honored with your favor of the twenty-fourth and its several in∣closures; and that since my letter of yesterday, no important event has taken place.</P>
<P>As colonel Hugh Stephenson, of the rifle regiment ordered lately to be raised, is dead, according to the information I have received, I would beg leave to recommend to the particular notice of Con∣gress captain Daniel Morgan just returned among the prison∣ers from Canada, as a fit and proper person to succeed to the vacancy occasioned by his death. Ths present field-offi∣cers of the regiment cannot claim any right in preference to him, because he ranked above them, and as a captain, when he first entered the service. His conduct as an officer, on the expedition with general Arnold last fall,—his intrepid beha∣vior in the assault upon Quebec, when the brave Montgo∣mery fell,—the inflexible attachment he professed to our cause du∣ring his imprisonment, and which he perseveres in,—added to these, his residence in the place colonel Stephenson came from, and his interest and influence in the same circle, and with such men as are to compose such a regiment,—all, in my opinion, entitle him to the favor of Congress, and lead me to be∣lieve that in his promotion the states will gain a good and valua∣ble officer for the sort of troops he is particularly recommended to command.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you last, nothing of im∣portance has transpired; though, from some movements yesterday on the part of the enemy, it would seem as if something was in∣tended.</P>
<P>The inclosed memorial, from lieutenant-colonel Shephard of the fourth regiment, I beg leave to submit to the consideration of Congress, and shall only add, that I could wish they would promote him to the command of the regiment and send him a commission, being a good and valuable officer, and especially as the vacancy is of a pretty long standing, and I have not had (nor has he) any intelligence from Colonel Learned him∣self (who had the command, and who obtained a discharge on account of his indisposition), of his design to return.—I have also inclosed a letter from captain Ballard, which Congress will please to determine on, the subject being new and not within my authority.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honor of transmitting to you the inclosed letter from lieutenant-colonel Livingston, with sundry copies of general Delancey's orders, which discover the measures the enemy are pursuing on Long-Island for raising recruits and obtaining supplies of provisions. In consequence of the intel∣ligence they contain, and authentic advices through other channels respecting these matters, I have sent brigadier-general George Clinton to meet general Lincoln who has got as far as Fairfield with part of the troops lately ordered by the Massachu∣setts assembly, to concert with him and others an expedition across the Sound with those troops, three companies under colonel Livingston, and such further aid as governor Trumbull can afford, in order to prevent if possible their effecting those important ob∣jects, and to assist the inhabiants in the removal of their stock, grain, &amp;c. or in destroying them, that the enemy may not derive any advantage or benefit from them.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="031423_0226_0FEC5B03B42BF118"/>
The recruiting scheme they are prosecuting with uncommon in∣dustry; nor is it confined to Long-Island alone. Having just now received a letter from the committee of West-Chester county, advising that there are several companies of men in that and Dutchess county preparing to go off and join the king's ar∣my, I have given directions to our guard-boats and the centries at our works at Mount-Washington to keep a strict look-out in case they attempt to come down the North-river; also to general Heath at Kingsbridge, that the utmost vigilance may be observed by the regiments and troops stationed above there and down tow∣ards the East-river, that they may intercept them, should they take that rout with a view of crossing to Long-Island.—I will use every precaution in my power, to prevent those parricides from ac∣complishing their designs; but I have but little hopes of success, as it will be no difficult matter for them to procure a passage over some part or other of the Sound.</P>
<P>I have been applied to lately by colonel Weedon of Virginia, for permission to recruit the deficiency of men in his regiment out of the troops composing the flying camp,—informing me at the same time that some of those from Maryland had offered to engage. Colonel Hand of the rifle battalion made a similar applica∣tion to-day. If the enlistments could be made, they would have this good consequence,—the securing of so many in the service. However, as the measure might occasion some uneasiness in their own corps, and be considered as a hardship by the states to which they belong, and the means of their furnishing more than the quota exacted from them in the general arrangement, and would make it more difficult for them to complete their own levies, I did not conceive myself at liberty to author∣ise it without submitting the propriety of it to the consideration of Congress, and obtaining their opinion whether it should be allow∣ed or not.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a list of warrants granted from the second to the thirteenth ultimo inclusive, the only return of that sort that I have been able to make since the resolution for that purpose,—owing to the unsettled state of our affairs, and my having sent my papers a∣way. You will also receive sundry letters, &amp;c. from general Schuyler, which came under cover to me, and which I have the honor of forwarding.</P>
<P>By a letter just received from the committee of safety of the state of New-Hampshire, I find a thousand of their militia were about to march on the twenty-fourth ultimo to reinforce this army in consequence of the requisition of Congress. Previ∣ous to their march, general Ward writes me he was obliged
<PB N="228" REF="031423_0227_0FEC5B075134D4B8"/>
to furnish them with five hundred pounds of powder, and a thou∣sand pounds of musket-ball; and I have little reason to expect that they are better provided with other articles than they were with ammunition. In such case they will only add to our present distress, which is already far too great, and become disgusted with the service, though the time they are engaged for is only till the first of December.—This will injure their enlisting for a long∣er term if not wholly prevent it.</P>
<P>By three deserters who came from the Galatea man-of-war a∣bout five days ago, we are informed that several transports had sailed, before they left her, from England, as it was generally reported, in order to return with a supply of provisions, of which they say there is a want.—General Mercer, in a let∣ter, informed me that general Thompson said he had heard they were going to dismiss about a hundred of the ships from the ser∣vice.—I am also advised by a letter from Mr. Derby at Boston, of the twenty-sixth ultimo, that, the day before, a trans∣port snow had been taken and sent into Piscataway by a privateer, in her passage from New-York to the West-Indies. She sail∣ed with five more under the convoy of a man-of-war in or∣der to bring from thence the troops that are there, to join general Howe.—They were all victualled for four months.—From this intelligence it would seem as if they did not appre∣hend any thing to be meditated against them by the court of France.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 3.—I have nothing in particular to communicate res∣pecting our situation, it being much the same as when I wrote last.—We had an alarm this morning a little before four o'clock, from some of our out-centries, who reported that a large body of the enemy was advancing towards our lines.—This put us in mo∣tion: however, it turned out entirely premature; or at least we saw nothing of them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE I knew of the late resolutions of Congress which you did me the honor to enclose in your letter of the twen∣ty-fourth, and before I was favored with the visit of your committee, I took the liberty of giving you my sentiments on several points which seemed to be of importance.—I have no doubt but that the committee will make such report of the state and condition of the army, as will induce Congress to believe
<PB N="229" REF="031423_0228_0FEC5B08E73260C8"/>
that nothing but the most vigorous exertions can put matters upon such a footing as to give this continent a fair prospect of success. Give me leave to say, sir—I say it with due defer∣ence and respect (and my knowledge of the facts, added to the importance of the cause, and the stake I hold in it, must justify the freedom,—that your affairs are in a more unpromising way than you seem to apprehend.</P>
<P>Your army, as I mentioned in my last, is on the eve of its political dissolution. True it is, you have voted a larger one in lieu of it; but the season is late; and there is a material dif∣ference between voting of battalions and raising of men. In the latter there are more difficulties than Congress are aware of; which makes it my duty (as I have been informed of the prevailing sentiments of this army) to inform them, that, unless the pay of the officers, especially that of the field officers is raised, the chief part of those that are worth retaining will leave the service at the expiration of the present term, as the soldiers will also, if some greater encourrgement is not offered them than twenty dollars and a hundred acres of land.</P>
<P>Nothing less, in my opinion, than a suit of clothes annually given to each non-commissioned officer and soldier, in addition to the pay and bounty, will avail; and I question whether that will do, as the enemy (from the information of one John Mash, who, with six others, was taken by our guards) are giving ten pounds bounty for recruits, and have got a battalion under major Rogers nearly completed upon Long-Island.</P>
<P>Nor will less pay, according to my judgment, than I have taken the liberty of mentioning in the inclosed estimate, retain such officers as we could wish to have continued. The differ∣ence per month in each battalion will amount to better than a hundred pounds. To this may be added the pay of the staff∣officers; for it is presumable they will not require an augment∣ation: but, being few in number, the sum will not be greatly increased by them, and consequently is a matter of no great moment: but it is a matter of no small importance to make the several officers desirable. When the pay and establishment of an officer once becomes objects of interested attention, the sloth, negligence, and even disobedience of orders, which at this time but too generally prevail, will be purged off. But while the service is viewed with indifference,—while the officer conceives that he is rather conferring than receiving an obligation,—there will be a total relaxation of all order and discipline, and every thing will move heavily on, to the great detriment
<PB N="230" REF="031423_0229_0FEC5B0B152C9BC8"/>
of the service, and inexpressible trouble and vexation of the general.</P>
<P>The critical situation of our affairs at this time will justify my saying that no time is to be lost in making of fruitless ex∣periments. An unavailing trial of a month to get an army upon the terms proposed may render it impracticable to do it at all, and prove fatal to our cause; as I am not sure whether any rubs in the way of our enlistments, or unfavorable turn in our affairs, may not prove the means of the enemy recruiting men faster than we do. To this may be added the inextricable difficulty of forming one corps out of another, and arranging matters with any degree of order, in the face of an enemy who are watching for advantages.</P>
<P>At Cambridge, last year, where the officers, (and more than a sufficiency of them) were all upon the spot, we found it a work of such extreme difficulty to know their sentiments (each having some terms to propose) that I despaired once of getting the arrangements completed: and I do suppose, that at least a hundred alterations took place before matters were finally ad∣justed. What must it be then under the present regulation, where the officer is to negotiate this matter with the state he comes from, distant perhaps, two or three hundred miles?—some of whom, without leave or licence from me, set out to make personal application, the moment the resolve got to their hands. What kind of officers these are I leave Congress to judge.</P>
<P>If an officer of reputation (for none other should be applied to) is asked to stay, what answer can he give, but in the first place, that he does not know whether it is at his option to do so, no provision being made in the resolution of Congress, even recommendatory of this measure; consequently, that it rests with the state he comes from (surrounded perhaps with a vari∣ety of applications, and influenced probably by local attach∣ments) to determine whether he can be provided for or not? In the next place, if he is an officer of merit, and knows that the state he comes from is to furnish more battalions than it at present has in the service, he will scarcely, after two years' faithful services, think of continuing in the rank he now bears, when new creations are to be made, and men appointed to offi∣ces (no wise superior in merit, and ignorant perhaps, of service) over his head. A committee, sent to the army from each state, may upon the spot fix things with a degree of propriety and certainty, and is the only method I can see of bringing matters to a decision with respect to the officers of the army.
<PB N="231" REF="031423_0230_0FEC5B10D6D74E28"/>
But what can be done in the mean while towards the arrang∣ment in the country, I know not. In the one case you run the hazard of loosing your officers; in the other, of encountering delay, unless some method could be devised of forwarding both at the same instant.</P>
<P>Upon the present plan, I plainly foresee an intervention of time between the old and new army, which must be filled up with militia (if to be had), with whom no man who has any regard for his own reputation can undertake to be answerable for consequences. I shall also be mistaken in my conjectures, if we do not lose the most valuable officers in this army, under the present mode of appointing them: consequently, if we have an army at all, it will be composed of materials not only en∣tirely raw, but, (if uncommon pains are not taken) entirely unfit; and I see such a distrust and jealousy of military power, that the commander-in-chief has not an opportunity, even by recommendation, to give the least assurances of reward for the most essential services. In a word, such a cloud of perplexing circumstances appear before me, without one flattering hope, that I am thoroughly convinced, unless the most vigorous and decisive exertions are immediately adopted to remedy these e∣vils, that the certain and absolute loss of our liberties will be the inevitable consequence; as one unhappy stroke will throw a powerful weight into the scale against us, enabling general Howe to recruit his army as fast as we shall ours,—numbers be∣ing disposed [<HI>to join him</HI>], and many actually doing so already. Some of the most probable remedies, and such as experience has brought to my more intimate knowlede, I have taken the liberty to point out: the rest I beg leave to submit to the consider∣ation of Congress.</P>
<P>I ask pardon for taking up so much of their time with my opinions. But I should betray that trust which they and my coun∣try have reposed in me, were I to be silent upon a matter so extremely interesting.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS last night honored with your favor of the second, with sundry resolutions of Congress. * * *</P>
<P>In respect to the exchange of prisoners, I fear it will be a work of great difficulty, owing to their dispersed and scattered
<PB N="232" REF="031423_0231_0FEC5B1760491B30"/>
situation throughout the states. In order to effect it, I have wrote to the eastern governments to have them collected, and to transmit me an account of their number, distinguishing the names and ranks of the field and commissioned officers, and the corps they belong to. I have also wrote to governor Livingston of the Jerseys upon the subject, and must take the liberty of requesting congress to give directions that a similar return may be made of those in Pennsylva∣nia and Maryland, and for their being brought to Brunswick, that they may be ready to be exchanged for an equal number of those of the same rank.</P>
<P>I observe, by the resolve of the twenty-sixth ultimo, that the exchange is particularly directed to be made of the officers and soldiers taken on Long-Island. But should not that follow the ex∣change of those officers and men who have lately returned from Quebec, whose imprisonment has been much longer, and whose service has not been less severe, and, in many instances, conducted with great intrepidity? I have had many applications since their arrival, by which they claim a kind of preference as far as their number and the circumstance of their rank will allow, and which I thought it my duty to mention, that I may obtain some direction upon the subject.</P>
<P>You will observe by a paragraph of a letter received yesterday from general Howe, a copy of which you have at length, that the non-performance of the agreement between captain Forster and general Arnold, by which the latter stipulated for the return of an equal number of officers and prisoners in our hands for those de∣livered him, is considered in an unfavorable light, and entirely imputed to me, as having the chief command of the armies of the states, and a controling power over general Arnold.—The pointed manner in which Mr. Howe is pleased to express himself could not personally effect me, supposing there had been no good grounds for the treaty not being ratified, having been nothing more than an instrument conveying to him the resolutions formed upon the subject. * * *</P>
<P>However I would beg leave to observe, from the letters from the hostages,—from what has been reported by others re∣specting captain Forster's having used his endeavors to restrain the savages from exercising their wonted barbarities, though in some instances they did,—his purchasing some of the prisoners for a pretty considerable premium,—but, above all, from the delicate nature of such treaties, and because the non-observance of them must damp the spirits of the officers who make them, and add affliction to the misfortunes of those whom necessity and the nature of the case force into captivity to give them a
<PB N="233" REF="031423_0232_0FEC5B1B9DE52320"/>
sanction by a long and irksome confinement,—for these reasons and many more that will readily occur, I could wish Congress to reconsider the matter, and to carry it into execution.</P>
<P>I am sensible the wrong was originally in their employing sa∣vages, and that whatever cruelties were committed by them should be esteemed their own acts: yet perhaps, in point of po∣licy, it may not be improper to overlook these infractions on their part, and to pursue that mode which will be the most likely to render the hardships incident to war most tolerable, and the grea∣test benefits to the state.</P>
<P>I have ventured to say thus much on the subject, from a regard to the service, and because such gentlemen of the army as I have heard mention it, seem to wish the treaty had been ratified rather than disallowed.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a list of vacancies in the third regiment of Virgi∣nia troops, in part occasioned by the death of major Leitch who died of his wounds on tuesday morning,—and of the gen∣tlemen who stand next in regimental order, and who are recom∣mended to succeed to them.—You will observe that captain John Fitzgerald is said to be appointed to the duty of major. This I have done in order, being the oldest captain in the re∣giment, and, I believe, an officer of unexceptionable merit, and as it was highly necessary at this time to have the corps as well and fully officered as possible. There is also a vacancy in the first continental battalion, by the promotion of lieutenant Clarke to a majority in the flying camp, to which colonel Hand has recommended William Patton to succeed, as you will perceive by his letter inclosed.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty to transmit a plan for establishing a corps of engineers, artificers, &amp;c. sketched out by colonel Putnam, and which is proposed for the consideration of Congress. How far they may incline to adopt it, or whether they may ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to pro∣ceed upon such an extensive scale, they will be pleased to deter∣mine. However, I conceive it a matter well worthy of their consideration, being convinced from experience, and from the reasons suggested by colonel Putnam who has acted with great diligence and reputation in the business, that some establishment of the sort is highly necessary, and will be productive of the most beneficial consequences.</P>
<P>If the proposition is approved by Congress, I am informed by good authority that there is a gentleman in Virginia, in the colony service, John Stadler, esquire, a native of Germany, whose abilities in this way are by no means inconsiderable. I am told he was an engineer in the army under general Stanwix,
<PB N="234" REF="031423_0233_0FEC5B1D30005C50"/>
and is reputed to be of skill and ingenuity in the profession. In this capacity I do not know him myself, but am intimately ac∣quainted with him in his private character, as a man of under∣standing and of good behaviour. I would submit his merit to the inquiry of Congress; and if he should answer the report I have had of him, I make no doubt but he will be suitably provided for.</P>
<P>The convention of this state have lately seized and had ap∣praised two new ships, valued at six thousand two hundred and twenty-nine pounds York currency, which they have sent down for the purpose of sinking, and obstructing the channel opposite Mount-Washington. The price being high, and the opinions various as to the necessity of the measure, some conceiving the obstruction nearly sufficient already, and others that they would render it secure, I would wish to have the direction of Con∣gress upon the subject by the earliest opportunity, thinking my∣self, that, if the enemy should attempt to come up, they should be used, sooner than to hazard their passing.—I must be governed by circumstances, yet hope for their sentiments before any thing is necessary to be done.</P>
<P>Sundry disputes having arisen of late between officers of dif∣ferent regiments and of the same rank, respecting the right of succession to such vacancies as happen from death or other causes,—some suggestion that it should be in a colonial line and governed by the priority of their commissions,—others, that it should be regimentally,—and there being an instance now be∣fore me, between the officers of the Virginia regiments, occa∣sioned by the death of major Leitch,—it has become absolutely necessary that Congress should determine the mode by which promotions are to be regulated,—whether colonially and by priority of commissions, or regimentally, reserving a right out of the general rule they adopt, to reward for particular merit, or of withholding from office such as may not be worthy to succeed.</P>
<P>I have only proposed two modes for their consideration, be∣ing satisfied that promotions through the line (as they are call∣ed) can never take place without producing discord, jealousy, distrust, and the most fatal consequences. In some of my let∣ters upon the subject of promotions, and one which I had the honor of addressing to the board of war on the thirtieth ultimo, I advised that the mode should be rather practised than resolv∣ed: but I am fully convinced now of the necessity there is of settling it in one of the two ways I have taken the liberty to point out, and under the restrictions I have mentioned; or the
<PB N="235" REF="031423_0234_0FEC5B1EE633D0D0"/>
disputes and applications will be endless, and attended with great inconveniences.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honor of transmitting to you a copy of a letter from the comte D'Emery, governor-general of the French part of St. Domingo, which I received yesterday, and also my answer, which I have enclosed and left open for the consi∣deration of Congress, wishing that it may be sealed if they ap∣prove of the sieur De Chambeau's releasement, which I think may be attended with many valuable consequences. If Con∣gress concur in sentiment with me, they will be pleased to give direction for his passage by the first opportunity to the French islands: if they do not, I shall be obliged by your returning my letter.</P>
<P>I have also the pleasure of inclosing a copy of a letter from monsieur P. Pennel, which came to hand last night, and which contains intelligence of an agreeable and interesting nature, for which I beg leave to refer you to the copy. The polite manner in which monsieur Pennel has requested to be one of my aids-de-camp demands my acknowledgments. As the appointment will not be attended with any expense, and will shew a proper regard for his complaisance and the attachment he is pleased to express for the service of the American states, I shall take the liberty of complying with his requisition, and transmit him a brevet com∣mission, provided the fame shall be agreeable to Congress.—Their sentiments upon this subject you will be kind enough to favor me with by the first opportunity. The inclosed letter for the sieur De Chambeau you will please to forward to him (if he is to be enlarged) after closing it.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I must take the liberty to observe that I am under no small difficulties on account of the French gentle∣men that are here in consequence of the commissions they have received,—having no means to employ them, or to afford them an opportunity of rendering that service they themselves wish to give, or which perhaps is expected by the public. Their want of our language is an objection to their being joined to a∣ny of the regiments here at this time, were there vacancies, and not other obstacles. These considerations induce me to
<PB N="236" REF="031423_0235_0FEC5B2272746D78"/>
wish that Congress would adopt and point out some particular mode to be observed respecting them. What it should be, they will be best able to determine. But to me it appears that their being here now can be attended with no valuable consequences, and that, as the power of appointing officers for the new army is vested in the conventions, &amp;c. of the several states, it will be necessary for Congress to direct them to be provided for in the regiments to be raised, according to the ranks they would wish them to bear—(or I am convinced they will never be ta∣ken in, let their merit be what it may); or to form them into a distinct corps which may be increased in time. They seem to be genteel, sensible men; and I have no doubt of their mak∣ing good officers as soon as they can learn as much of our lan∣guage as to make themselves well understood: but, unless Con∣gress interfere by their particular direction to the states, they will never be incorporated in any of the regiments to be raised; and, without they are, they will be entirely at a loss, and in the most irksome situation, for something to do, as they now are.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of writing you yesterday, I have been favored with a letter from the honorable council of Mas∣sachusetts-Bay, covering one from Richard Derby, esquire, a copy of which is herewith transmitted, as it contains intelligence of an important and interesting nature.</P>
<P>As an exchange of prisoners is about to take place, I am in∣duced, from a question stated in a letter I received from go∣vernor Trumbull this morning, to ask the opinion of Congress in what manner the states that have had the care of them are to be reimbursed the expenses incurred on their account. My want of information in this instance, or whether any account is to be sent in with the prisoners, would not allow me to give him an answer, as nothing that I recollect has ever been said upon the subject.—He also mentions another matter, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> whe∣ther such privates as are mechanics, and others who may desire to remain with us, should be obliged to return.—In respect to the latter, I conceive there can be no doubt of our being un∣der a necessity of returning the whole, a proposition having been made on our part for a general exchange, and that agreed to; besides, the balance of prisoners is greatly against us; and
<PB N="237" REF="031423_0236_0FEC5B247A65C888"/>
I am informed it was particularly stipulated by general Montgo∣mery, that all those that were taken in Canada should be exchang∣ed whenever a cartel was settled for the purpose.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, I should suppose the several commit∣tees having the care of them should be instructed to make the most exact returns of the whole, however willing a part should be to continue with us. At the same time I should think it not impro∣per to inform them of the reasons leading to the measure, and that they should be invited to escape afterwards, which, in all proba∣bility, they may effect without much difficulty if they are attach∣ed to us, extending their influence to many more, and bringing them away also.</P>
<P>The situation of our affairs and the present establishment of the army requiring our most vigorous exertions to engage a new one, I presume it will be necessary to furnish the paymas∣ter-general as early as possible with money to pay the bounty, late∣ly resolved on, to such men as will enlist. Prompt pay, per∣haps may have a happy effect, and induce the continuance of some who are here: but, without it, I am certain that no∣thing can be done; nor have we time to lose in making the expe∣riment. But then it may be asked, who is to recruit? or who can consider themselves as officers for that purpose, till the conventions of the different states have made the appoint∣ments?</P>
<P>Yesterday afternoon the exchange between lord Sterling and governor Browne was carried into execution; and his lordship is now here. He confirms the intelligence mentioned by captain Souther, about the transports he met, by the arrival of the Daphne man-of-war (a twenty gun ship) a few days ago, with twelve ships under her convoy, having light-horse on board. They sailed with about twenty in each, and lost about eighteen in their passage, besides those in the vessel taken by cap∣tain Souther.—He further adds that he had heard it acknowledged more than once, that, in the action of the sixteenth ultimo, the enemy had a hundred men killed,—about sixty Highlanders of the forty-second regiment, and forty of the light infantry. This confession coming from themselves, we may reasonably con∣clude, did not exaggerate the number, * * *</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 9.—About eight o'clock this morning, two ships, of forty-four guns each (supposed to be the Roebuck and Phoenix), and a frigate of twenty guns, with three or four tenders, got under way from about Bloomingdale where they had been lying some time, and stood with an easy southerly breeze to∣wards
<PB N="238" REF="031423_0237_0FEC5B2AB8150A58"/>
our chevaux-de-frise, which we hoped would have intercept∣ed their passage while our batteries played upon them: but, to our surprise and mortification, they ran through without the least difficulty, and without receiving any apparent damage from our forts, though they kept up a heavy fire from both sides of the river. Their destination or views cannot be known with certainty: but most probably they are sent to stop the navigation, and cut off the supplies of boards, &amp;c. which we should have re∣ceived, and of which we are in great need. They are standing up, and I have dispatched an express to the convention of this state, that notice may be immediately communicated to gene∣ral Clinton at the Highland fortifications, to put him on his guard in case they should have any designs against them, and that precautions should be taken to prevent the craft belonging to the river falling into their hands.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG leave to inform you, that, since my letter of the eighth and ninth instant which I had the honor of addressing you, nothing of importance has occurred, except of that the ships of war which I then mentioned, in their passage up the river, took a sloop that was at anchor off the mouth of Spitendevil, and two of our row-gallies which they out-sailed. The crews, finding that they could not prevent them falling into the enemy's hands, ran them near the shore and effected their own escape. From the intelligence I have received, the ships are now ly∣ing at Tarrytown, without having landed any men (which seemed to be apprehended by some), or attempted any thing else. Their principal views in all probability are, to interrupt our navigation, and to receive such disaffected persons as incline to take part against us. The former they will effect beyond all question; and I fear that their expectations respecting the latter will be but too fully answered.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 12.—The inclosed copy of a letter received last night from the convention of this state will shew you the appre∣hensions they are under on account of the disaffected among them.—I have ordered up a part of the militia from the Massa∣chusetts under general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to prevent, if possible, the con∣sequences which they suggest may happen, and which there is reason to believe the conspirators have in contemplation. I am pursuaded that they are upon the eve of breaking out, and
<PB N="239" REF="031423_0238_0FEC5B2C483DF470"/>
that they will leave nothing un-essayed that will distress us and favor the designs of the enemy, as soon as their schemes are ripe for it.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 13.—Yesterday the enemy landed at Frog's-Point, about nine miles from hence, further up the sound. Their number we cannot ascertain, as they have not advanced from the point,—which is a kind of island,—but the water that sur∣rounds it is favorable at low tide. I have ordered works to be thrown up at the passes from the point to the main. From the great number of sloops, schooners, and nine ships, that went up the Sound in the evening, full of men, and from the informa∣tion of two deserters who came over last night, I have reason to believe that the greatest part of their army has moved upwards, or is about to do it, pursuing their original plan of get∣ting in our rear and cutting off our communication with the coun∣try.</P>
<P>The grounds from Frog's-Point are strong and defensible, be∣ing full of stone fences both along the road and across the adjacent fields, which will render it difficult for artillery, or indeed a large body of foot, to advance in any regular order, except through the main road.—Our men who are posted on the passes seemed to be in great spirits when I left them last night.</P>

<P>HIS excellency having gone this morning to visit our posts beyond Kingsbridge and the several passes leading from Frog's∣Point and the necks adjacent, I have the honor to inform you by his command, that no interesting event has taken place since his letter by yesterday's post.</P>
<P>Every day's intelligence from the convention of this state holds forth discoveries of new plots and of new conspiracies. Some of the members seem to apprehend that insurrections are up∣on the eve of breaking out, and have suggested the necessity of seizing and securing the passes through the Highlands, lest the disaffected should do it. Their preservation being a matter of great importance, his excellency, notwithstanding the situ∣ation we are in with respect to troops, has detached colonel Tash with his regiment, lately from New-Hampshire, in addition to the militia mentioned in his last, with directions to re∣ceive orders from the convention, as to the station and posts he is to occupy.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="031423_0239_0FEF8BD9D2A37048"/>
There are now in our possession several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inhabitants of this state, who had engaged to join the enemy, and were inter∣cepted in going to them. There are also two who confess they have been with them, and that they had actually engaged in their service: but, finding the terms (the bounty, pay, &amp;c.) not so advantageous as they expected from the information they had received, they were induced to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>turn.—As the affairs of this government are in a precarious situation, and such as, the convention themselves seem to think, forbid their interposition farther than taking measures to apprehend them, his excellency would wish to obtain the sentiments of Congress, and their direc∣tion upon a subject so extremely critical and delicate, and which, in the consideration of it, involves many important conse∣quences.</P>
<P>Your favor of the ninth, with its several inclosures, his excel∣lency received yesterday morning by the express, who proceeded immediately on his journey.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 17.—I am directed by his excellency to acquaint you that we are again obliged to change our disposition, to counteract the operations of the enemy. Declining an attack up∣on our front, they have drawn the main body of their ar∣my to Frog's-Point, with a design of hemming us in, and drawing a line in our rear. To prevent the consequences which would but too probably follow the execution of their scheme, the general officers determined yesterday that our forces must be taken from hence, and extended towards East and West Chester, so as to out-flank them. General Lee, who arrived on monday, has strongly urged the absolute necessity of the measure. It is proposed to leave a garrison at Fort Washington, and to maintain it if possible, in order to preserve the communication with the Jer∣seys.—They are landing their artillery and waggons upon the point; and there are now several boats passing up the Sound, full of men.</P>

<P>I WAS yesterday morning honored with your favor of the fifteenth, with the resolutions of the eleventh and fourteenth. The latter, by which Congress have authorised me to appoint monsieur Pennel a brevet aid-de-camp, claims a return of my ac∣knowledgments.</P>
<P>Last night I received a letter from Mr. Varick, secretary to general Schuyler inclosing a copy of one from general Arnold to general Gates. The intelligence transmitted by general Arnold being of an extremely interesting and important nature, I thought it advisable to forward the same immediately by express. You have a copy herewith, which contains the particulars, and to which I beg leave to refer you.</P>
<P>The accounts transmitted you yesterday by post will inform you of the movements of the enemy, and of the measures judged ne∣cessary to be pursued by us, to counteract their designs. I have nothing to add on this head, except that ten or eleven ships, which have been prevented passing Hell-gate for two or three days for want of wind, are now under way, and proceeding up the Sound. Amongst them there appear to be two frigates: the rest probably have in stores, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a copy of the last general return I have been able to obtain. It only comes down to the fifth instant: the situa∣tion of our affairs, and the almost constant necessity of sending de∣tachments from one place to another to watch the enemy's mo∣tions, have prevented the officers from making them with regularity.</P>

<P>I HAVE it in command from his excellency to transmit you the inclosed copies of dispatches which just now came to hand, and which contain intelligence of the most interesting and important nature respecting our affairs in the northern department. His ex∣cellency would have wrote himself, but was going to our several posts, when the express arrived.</P>
<P>The enemy are pursuing with great industry their plan of pene∣trating the country from the Sound, and of forming a line in our rear. They are now extended from Frog's-Point to New-Rochelle.
<PB N="242" REF="031423_0241_0FEF8BB3A32C8C10"/>
from whence it is generally conjectured they mean to take their route by way of the White-Plains, and from thence to draw a line to the North-river. We on our part have drawn our whole force, except the regiments intended to garrison Fort∣Washington, from the island of New-York, and have possess∣ed ourselves of the heights, passes, and advantageous grounds be∣tween New-Rochelle, where the van of their army now lies, and the North-River.—They will in all probability attempt to effect their purpose by moving higher up. If they do, our forces wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> move accordingly, it being a principal object to prevent their out∣flanking us.</P>
<P>On friday, one of their advanced parties, near East-Chester, fell in with part of colonel Glover's brigade, and a smart and close skirmish ensued, in which, I have the pleasure to inform you, our men behaved with great coolness and intrepidity, and drove the enemy back to their main body.</P>

<P>I AM directed by his excellency, whose business has called him from hence, to acknowledge his receipt of your favors of the twelfth and fifteenth instant, and to inform you in answer to the first, that he will mention the case of the French gen∣tlemen to general Lee, and obtain his opinion as to the best mode of providing for them in a useful way.

<P>THE whole of our army is now here and on the neighbor∣ing heights, except the troops left at Mount-Washington and Kingsbridge (about fourteen hundred at the former, and six hundred at the latter), and general Lee's division which now forms the rear, and which is on their march. Our removal, and that of the stores, have been attended with a great deal of trouble, owing to the scarcity and difficulty of procuring waggons. However, they are nearly effected, and without any loss.—The general officers are now reconnoitering the several passes lead∣ing from the enemy, that the most important may be immediately secured.—The situation of their army remains nearly the same as when I had the honor of addressing you on the twenty-first instant. It differs in nothing unless it is that their main body is more col∣lected about New-Rochelle. A few of their troops are extended as far as Momarioneck.</P>
<P>On monday night a detachment of our men, under the command of colonel Hazlet, was sent out to surprise and cut off ma∣jor Rogers, if possible, with his regiment which was posted there. By some accident or other the expedition did not succeed so well as I could have wished. However, our advanced party, led on by major Greene of the first Virginia regiment, fell in with their out-guard, and brought off thirty-six prisoners, sixty muskets, and some blankets. The number killed is not certainly known: but it is reported by an officer who was there, that he counted about twenty-five.—Our loss, two kill∣ed,
<PB N="244" REF="031423_0243_0FEF8BC7C8DE4768"/>
and ten or twelve wounded; among the latter, major Greene, whose recovery is very doubtful.</P>
<P>On wednesday there was also a smart skirmish between a party of colonel Hands' riflemen,—about two hundred and forty,—and nearly the same number of Hessian chasseurs, in which the latter were put to the rout. Our men buried ten of them on the field, and took two prisoners, one badly wounded. We sustained no other loss than having one lad wounded, supposed mor∣tally.</P>
<P>The ships of war that are in the North-river, fell down yester∣day morning or the evening before, to Dobbs's ferry, to pre∣vent our bringing stores from below by water, and the re∣moval of those that are landed there. As soon as the waggons, employed in bringing the baggage and stores of general Lee's di∣vision, are disengaged, they will be immediately sent to assist those already there to remove them.</P>
<P>On saturday night we had the misfortune to lose one of the new ships intended to be sunk for obstructing the channel. She parted her cables in a severe squall, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen properly ballasted, and bilged as soon as she struck the shore. The other ship was sunk well; and yesterday morning two brigs, both ready, were sent down for the same purpose.</P>
<P>About two o'clock this afternoon, intelligence was brought to head-quarters that three or four detachments of the enemy were on their march, and had advanced within about four miles of this place. It has been fully confirmed since by a variety of persons who have been out to reconnoitre.—Their number cannot be ascer∣tained: but it is generally conjectured that the detachments are or will be succeeded by as many columns composing their main body. Our drums have beat to arms, and the men are ordered to their several posts.—Most probably some important event is upon the eve of taking place; I hope it will be victory in favor of our arms.—General Lee, with his division, has not got up; but I hear he is on his march.</P>
<P>Experiment having proved it difficult, if not impossible, to pre∣vent the enemy from possessing the navigation of the North∣river, and to rendering the communication and intercourse be∣tween the states divided by it extremely hazardous and preca∣rious by means of their ships of war, it has become a matter of important consideration how to remedy the evil, and to guard against the consequences which may result from it. I am charged by his excellency to mention it to Congress is a mat∣ter that has employed much of his thought, and that seems worthy of the most serious attention. He has communicated
<PB N="245" REF="031423_0244_0FEF8BD84B64CF20"/>
it to several of the general and other officers, and to many gen∣tlemen of sense and discernment, who all agree with him, not only upon the propriety, but the absolute necessity that two distinct armies should be formed,—one to act particularly in the states which lie on the east, the other in those that are on the south of the river;—the whole however to be raised on a general plan, and not to be confined to any particular place by the terms of enlist∣ment. These matters,—the apparent difficulty and perhaps im∣practicability of succours being thrown across the river while the enemy can command it,—have induced his excellency to submit the measures to their consideration, not knowing how their opera∣tions may be directed, and foreseeing that innumerable evils may arise if a respectable force is not appointed to oppose their arms, wherever they are carried.</P>

<P>THE situation of of our affairs not permitting his excellency to write himself, I have it in charge to inform you, that, on yesterday morning about ten o'clock, the enemy appeared in several large columns in our front, and, from their first movements, seemed as if they meant an attack there. However, halting for a little time, their main body filed off to the left, and presently began a most severe and incessant cannonade, at a part of our troops who had taken post on a hill, with a view of throwing up some lines. At the same time they advanced in two divisions, and, after a smart engagement for about a quarter of an hour, obliged our men to give way.</P>
<P>Our loss is not certainly known; but, from conjecture, is be∣tween four and five hundred in killed, wounded, and missing.—What theirs was, we have not heard.</P>
<P>After gaining the hill (upon which they are intrenching) and leaving a sufficient number of men and artillery to prevent our repossessing it, they proceeded to advance by our left: and, as far as I can discover, their posts or encampments now form nearly a semi-circle. It is evident their design is to get in our rear according to their original plan.—Every measure is taking to prevent them: but the removal of our baggage, &amp;c. is attended with infinite difficulty and delays.</P>
<P>Our post, from its situation, is not so advantageous as could be wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed, and was only intended as temporary and occasional,
<PB N="246" REF="031423_0245_0FEF8BB00E01EC18"/>
till the stores belonging to the army, which had been deposited here, could be removed. The enemy coming on so suddenly has distressed us much.

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the twenty∣ninth instant, no event of importance has occurred. The ene∣my are throwing up some lines and redoubts in our front, with a view of cannonading as soon as they are ready; and at the same time are extending their wings farther by our right and left. It is supposed that one of their objects is to advance a part of their troops, and seize on the bridge over Croton river, that the communication may be cut off with the upper country. To prevent this, a part of our force is detached, with orders to proceed with the utmost expedition, and to secure the pass if possible.</P>
<P>We are trying to remove, to guard against their designs, but are greatly impeded by reason of the scarcity of waggons in pro∣portion to our baggage and stores. Every exertion has been em∣ployed to obtain a sufficiency; but they cannot be had in this part of the country. The quarter-master has sent to Connecticut to get a supply if possible.</P>
<P>Our army is decreasing fast. Several gentlemen, who have come to camp within a few days, have observed large numbers of militia returning home on the different roads: nor are any measures taken as yet to raise the new army, no commissions having come from the states to appoint or signify the nomination of their officers. If this was done, perhaps many who are now here might be induced to engage: but at present there are none authorised to recruit.</P>

<P>I AM directed by his excellency to acknowledge his re∣ceipt of your favor of the twenty-eighth ultimo, which came to hand yesterday evening, and to transmit you a copy of the letter I had the honor of writing you by the Boston express, by his command. Had the express been charged with no other letter, the loss would not have been attended with any material injury to us, or advantage to the enemy, provided it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould come to their hands; but there were others from his excel∣lency, of a very interesting nature, the miscarriage of which gives him much concern. As the bundle was taken away in so sudden and secret a manner, I fear there is but little hope of recovering it,—being done most probably for the express pur∣pose of furnishing the enemy with intelligence, and a state of our army. Besides his excellency's letters, the most material of which was to Mr. Rutledge, there were five or six more from the gentlemen of his family.</P>
<P>My letters of the twenty-ninth and of yesterday, which I had the honor of addressing you, will give a pretty full account of our situation, and of every matter respecting this army, an∣tecedent to this date. I only omitted to mention that we have taken thirteen of the Waldeckers, and that, for several days past, our scouting parties have brought in one, two, or three prisoners. In addition to these, we have every day a deserter or two.</P>
<P>About six o'clock this morning, a messenger arrived from lord Sterling (who is with his brigade between two and three miles from White-Plains, on our right, and rather nearer the North∣river) with intelligence that the enemy were advancing towards him in two columns. This information has carried his excellency and aids out. The result of their movement I have not heard: but most likely they are pursuing their original design of getting by our flanks and seizing the heights above us. Every precaution is taking to prevent them, and to hurry away our stores to a more interior part of the country.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor to be, &amp;c. R. H. HARRISON.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. His excellency has just returned, and says the alarm was premature. It arose from some of lord Sterling's advanced guards seeing a body of our men who had been ordered to rein∣force him, who were supposed to be the enemy. His excel∣lency is very apprehensive that the army will be greatly dis∣tressed for want of provision, particularly in the article of flour, owing to the water-conveyance, both in the North and East∣river
<PB N="248" REF="031423_0247_0FEF8BE00F0B7C78"/>
being in the enemy's possession. He has wrote to the convention of this state, and directed Mr. Trumbull, that their utmost exertions in this instance may be used. There is a good deal of flour on the Jersey side: but there is no other way to get it, but by carting and ferrying it over to Peekskill. This I have wrote to general Greene to have done, by his excellency's direction.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY command of his excellency, I have the honor to inform you that our situation is nearly the same as when I had the plea∣sure of writing you last. It is altered in no instance, unless in the number of our troops, which is every day decreasing by their most scandalous desertion and return home. The inclosed letter from general Parsons, who is stationed near the Saw-pits, and which his excellency directed me to transmit, will inform you of the pre∣valency of this disgraceful practice.</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY command of his excellency, I have the honor to ac∣knowledge his receipt of your favor of the twenty-fourth ulti∣mo, and to inform you that he esteems the plan you propose to lay before Congress, for preventing more rations being drawn than may be due, well calculated to answer the end. That respecting the sick seems to him not entirely perfect. The cap∣tains or commanders of companies are prohibited from drawing pay for such sick as may be discharged from the hospitals as unfit for service. If, during their stay, and before it can be known whether their case will or will not admit of their return, it should become necessary to make up a regimental pay-abstract, in what manner are the officers to make up their rolls? are they to include the sick or not?</P>
<P>As this is a case which may and must of necessity frequently happen, it appears to his excellency that the intended regula∣tions should be more general, and restrain the officers from in∣cluding in their pay-abstracts or rolls all the sick they send to the hospitals, and the pay due them previous to their going. In
<PB N="249" REF="031423_0248_0FEF8D3CA2104A88"/>
such case, those who are discharged as unfit for service may receive their pay as intended; and those who return to duty can obtain what was due to them when the regiment was paid, by applying to the paymaster with the officer and surgeon's certificates, or be included in a subsequent abstract. The inconveniences and abuses which are designed to be remedied by these regu∣lations, his excellency does not apprehend to arise so much from necessity (as incident to the nature of armies), as from the imperfect institution of the present, and the great mixture and di∣versity of troops composing it, and also from the inattention of the officers. * * *</P>
<P>The defenceless state of Pennsylvania, as communicated by the committee of safety to your honorable body, is a matter of much concern to his excellency, who is not a little aggravated by the part too many seem ready to take in favor of the enemy. He trusts, however, the defection will be too inconsiderale to threat∣en any alarming consequences.</P>
<P>Before the receipt of your letter, his excellency had wrote to the commanding officer of the Virginia regiments at Trenton, di∣recting him to march them forward towards general Greene's post, and there remain under his command till further or∣ders, unless special instructions had been or should be given to the contrary by Congress, or for their particular destina∣tion.</P>
<P>Agreeable to your request, his excellency has consulted with general Lee upon the best mode for employing the French gentle∣men, and making them serviceable. The result is that they should be appointed to regiments by Congress according to the ranks they have been pleased to give them, and with the same pay as is allowed other officers in such cases. Their want of our language is rather an objection: but it is hoped they will attain a sufficient knowledge of it, ere it be long, to be of great service; and that, in the interim, their advice and assistance in directing of works may be of use where they may be stationed.—With great respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you that on yesterday morning the enemy made a sudden and unexpected movement from the several posts they had taken in our front. They
<PB N="250" REF="031423_0249_0FEC5B4C73CB3760"/>
broke up their whole encampments the preceding night, and have advanced towards Kingsbridge and the North-river. The de∣sign of this manoeuvre is a matter of much conjecture and speculation, and cannot be accounted for with any degree of certainty. The grounds we had taken possession of were strong and advantageous, and such as they could not have gained without much loss of blood in case an attempt had been made. I had taken every precaution to prevent their out-flanking us;—which may have led to the present measure. They may still have in view their original plan, and, by a sud∣den wheel, try to accomplish it. Detachments are constantly out to observe their motions, and to harrass them as much as possible.</P>
<P>In consequence of this movement I called a council of general officers to-day, to consult of such measures as should be adopted in case they pursued their retreat to New-York; the result of which is herewith transmitted. In respect to myself, I can∣not indulge an idea that general Howe, supposing he is go∣ing to New-York, means to close the campaign, and to sit down without attempting something more. I think it highly proba∣ble, and almost certain, that he will make a descent with a part of his troops into Jersey; and, as soon as I am satisfied that the present manoeuvre is real and not a feint, I shall use every means in my power to forward a part of our force to coun∣teract his designs; nor shall I be disappointed if he sends a detach∣ment to the southward for the purpose of making a winter cam∣paign.</P>
<P>From the information I have received, there is now a number of transports at Red-Hook, with about three thousand troops on board. Their destination, as given out, is to Rhode-Island; but this seems altogether improbable for various reasons; a∣mong others, the season is much against it. In the southern states they will find it milder, and much more favorable for their purposes. I shall take the liberty of mentioning that it may not be improper to suggest the probability of such a measure to the assemblies and conventions in those states, that they may be on their guard,—and the propriety of their establishing and laying up magazines of provisions and other necessaries in suitable places. This is a matter of exceeding importance, and what cannot be too much attended to.</P>
<P>From the approaching dissolution of the army, and the depar∣ture of the new levies which is on the eve of taking place, and the little prospect of levying a new one in time, I have wrote to the eastern states by the unanimous advice of the ge∣neral
<PB N="251" REF="031423_0250_0FEC5B4E544525E0"/>
officers, to forward supplies of militia in the room of those that are now here, and who, it is feared, will not be prevailed on to stay any longer than the time they are engaged for. The pro∣priety of this application, I trust, will appear, when it is known that not a single officer is yet commissioned to recruit, and when it is considered how essential it is to keep up some shew of force and shadow of an army.</P>
<P>I expect the enemy will bend their force against Fort-Washing∣ton, and invest it immediately. From some advices it is an ob∣ject that will attract their earliest attention.</P>
<P>I am happy to inform you, that, in the engagement on monday se'nnight, I have reason to believe our loss was by no means so considerable as was conjectured at first. By some deserters and prisoners we are told, that of the enemy was tolerably great; some accounts make it about four hundred in killed and wounded: all agree that among the former there was a colonel Carr of the thirty-fifth regiment.</P>
<P>The force that will be sent to Jersey after I am satisfied of Mr. Howe's retreat, in addition to those now there, according to my present opinion, will make it necessary for me to go with them, to put things in a proper channel, and such a way of defence as shall seem most probable to check the progress of the enemy, in case they should attempt a descent there, or a move to∣ward Philadelphia.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honor to transmit you a copy of a letter from general Gates to general Schuyler, and of another paper contain∣ing intelligence respecting the northern army and the situa∣tion of the enemy in that department. They this minute came to hand; and to them I beg leave to refer you for particulars.</P>
<P>By every information I can obtain, and the accounts I had last night by two deserters who were very intelligent and par∣ticular, general Howe still has in view an expedition to the Jer∣seys, and is preparing for it with the greatest industry. I have detached the first division of our troops which was thought neces∣sary to be sent, and which I hope will cross the river at Peeks∣kill to-day. The second, I expect, will all march this even∣ing; and to-morrow morning I propose to follow myself, in order to put things in the best train I can, and to give him every possible opposition.—I hope (when the two divisions arrive, and are joined to such other force as I expect to collect) to check his progress and prevent him from penetrating any distance from the river, if not to oblige him to return immediately with some loss. Whatever is in my power to effect, shall be done.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE only time to acknowledge the honor of your letter of the fifth instant, and its several inclosures, and to inform you, that, agreeable to the resolves of Congress, I shall use every measure in my power that the moving and present confused state of the army will admit of, to appoint officers for re∣cruiting.</P>
<P>You will have been advised, before this, of the arrival of commissioners from the Massachusetts. Others have come from Connecticut: but, from the present appearance of things, we seem but little if any nearer to levying an army. I had anticipa∣ted the resolve respecting the militia, by writing to the eastern states and to the Jersey, by the advice of my general offi∣cers,
<PB N="253" REF="031423_0252_0FEC5B5733FAF9F0"/>
and from a consciousness of the necessity of getting in a number of men if possible, to keep up the appearance of an ar∣my. How my application will succeed, the event must deter∣mine. I have little or no reason to expect that the militia now here will remain a day longer than the time they first engaged for. I have recommended their stay, and requested it in general orders. General Lincoln and the Massachusetts commissioners are using their interest with those from that state: but, as far as I can judge, we cannot rely on their staying.</P>
<P>I left White-Plains about eleven o'clock yesterday;—all peace then. The enemy appeared to be preparing for their expedition to Jersey according to every information. What their designs are, or whether their present conduct is not a feint, I can∣not determine.</P>
<P>The Maryland and Virginia troops under lord Sterling have crossed the river, as have part of these from the Jersey: the re∣mainder are now embarking. The troops, judged necessary to secure the several posts through the Highlands, have also got up. I am going to examine the passes, and direct such works as may appear necessary; after which, and making the best dis∣position I can of things in this quarter, I intend to proceed to Jersey, which I expect to do to-morrow.</P>
<P>The Assemblies of Massachusetts and Connecticut, to induce their men more readily to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age in the service, have voted an advance pay of twenty shillings per month, in addition to that allowed by the Congress to privates. It may perhaps be the means of their levying the quotas exacted from them sooner than they could otherwise have been raised: but I am of opini∣on, a more fatal and mistaken policy could not have entered their councils, or one more detrimental to the general cause. The influence of the vote will become continental, and materi∣ally effect the other states in making up their levies. If they could do it, I am certain, when the troops come to act toge∣ther, that jealousy, impatience and mutiny, would necessarily arise. A different pay cannot exist in the same army. The rea∣sons are obvious, and experience has proved their force in the case of the eastern and southern troops last spring. Sensi∣ble of this, and of the pernicious consequences that would in∣evitably result from the advance, I have prevented the com∣missioners from proceeding or publishing their terms till they could obtain the sense of Congress upon the subject, and remon∣strated against it in a letter to governor Trumbull. I am not singular in opinion: I have the concurrence of all the general offi∣cers, of its fatal tendency.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="031423_0253_0FEC5B59335C0E58"/>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you of my arrival here yes∣terday, and that the whole of the troops belonging to the states, which lay south of Hudson's river, and which were in New∣York government, have passed over to this side, except the re∣giment, lately colonel Smallwood's, which I expect is now on their march.</P>
<P>That they may be ready to check any incursion the enemy may attempt in this neighborhood, I intend to quarter them at Brunswick, Amboy, Elizabeth-Town, Newark, and about this place, unless Congress should conceive it necessary for any of them to be stationed at or more contiguous to Philadelphia. In such case they will be pleased to signify their pleasure. There will be very few of them after the departure of those who were engaged for the flying camp, which is fast approach∣ing. The disposition I have mentioned seems to me well cal∣culated for the end proposed, and also for their acccommoda∣tion.</P>
<P>The movements and designs of the enemy are not yet under∣stood. Various are the opinions and reports on this head. From every information, the whole have removed from Dobbs's fer∣ry towards Kingsbridge: and it seems to be generally believed on all hands, that the investing of Fort-Washington is one ob∣ject they have in view; but that can employ but a small part of their force. Whether they intend a southern expedition, must be determined by time: to me there appears a probability of it, which seems to be favored by the advices we have that ma∣ny transports are wooding and watering. General Greene's letter would give you the substance of the intelligence brought by Mr. Mersereau from Staten-Island in this instance, which he received before it came to me.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have copies of two letters from general Howe, and of my answer to the first of them. The letter alluded to, and returned in his last, was one from myself to Mrs. Washing∣ton, of the twenty-fifth ultimo, from whence I conclude that all the letters which went by the Boston express have come to his possession. You will also perceive that general Howe has re∣quested
<PB N="255" REF="031423_0254_0FEC5B5B5BD06C20"/>
the return of Peter Jack, a servant to major Stewart, to which I have consented, as he was not in the military line, and the requisition agreeable to the custom of war. This servant hav∣ing been sent to Philadelphia with the Waldeckers and other pris∣oners, I must request the favor of you to have him conveyed to general Greene by the earliest opportunity, in order that he may be returned to his master.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave not only to suggest but to urge the necessity of increasing our field artillery very consider∣bly. Experience has convinced me, as it has every gentleman of discernment in this army, that, while we remain so much inferior to the enemy in this instance, we must carry on the war under infinite disadvantages, and without the smallest probability of success. It has been peculiarly owing to the situation of the country where their operations have been conducted, and to the rough and strong grounds we possessed ourselves of, and over which they had to pass, that they have not carried their arms, by means of their artillery, to a much greater extent. When these difficulties cease by changing the scene of action to a level campaign country, the worst of consequences are to be apprehended. I would therefore, with the concurrence of all the officers whom I have spoken to upon the subject, submit to the consideration of Congress whether immediate measures ought not to be taken for procuring a respectable train.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands that each battalion should be fur∣nished at least with two pieces, and that a smaller number than a hundred of three pounds, fifty of six pounds, and fifty of twelve pounds, should not be provided, in addition to those we now have. Besides these, if some eighteen and twenty-four-pounders are ordered, the train will be more serviceable and complete. The whole should be of brass, for the most obvious reasons; they will be much more portable, not half so liable to burst; and, when they do, no damage is occasioned by it, and they may be cast over again. The sizes before described should be particularly attended to: if they are not, there will be great reason to expect mistakes and confusion in the charges in time of action, as it has frequently happened in the best-regulated armies. The disparity between those I have mentioned and such as are of an intermediate size is difficult to discern.</P>
<P>It is also agreed that a regiment of artillerists, with approved and experienced officers, should be obtained if possible, and some engineers of known reputation and abilities. I am sorry to say, too ready an indulgence has been had to several appointments in
<PB N="256" REF="031423_0255_0FEC5B6108DC0D18"/>
the latter instance, and that men have been promoted, who seem to me to know but very little if any thing of the business.</P>
<P>Perhaps this train, &amp;c. may be looked upon by some as large and expensive. True, it will be so: but when it is considered that the enemy, having effected but little in the course of the pre∣sent campaign, will use their utmost efforts to subjugate us in the next; every consideration of that sort should be disregarded, and every possible preparation made to frustrate their * * * at∣tempts. How they are to be procured, is to be enquired into.—That we cannot provide them among ourselves, or more than a very small proportion, so trifling as not to deserve our notice, is evident. Therefore I would advise, with all imaginable defer∣ence, that, without any abatement of our own internal exertions, application should be immediately made to such powers as can and may be willing to supply them. They cannot be obtained too early if soon enough; and I am told they may be easily had from France and Holland.</P>
<P>Mr. Trumbull the commissary-general has frequently mention∣ed to me of late the inadequacy of his pay to his trouble and the great risk he is subject to on account of the large sums of money which pass through his hands. He has stated his case with a view of laying it before Congress and obtaining a more adequate compensation. My sentiments upon the subject are already known: but yet I shall take the liberty to add that I think his complaint to be well founded, and his pay, considering the im∣portant duties and risks of his office, by no means sufficient, and that the footing he seems to think it should be upon, himself, ap∣pears just and reasonable.</P>
<P>A proposition having been made long since to general Howe and agreed to by him, for an exchange of prisoners in conse∣quence of the resolutions of Congress to that effect, I shall be extremely happy if you will give directions to the committees and those having the charge of prisoners in the several states south of Jersey, to transmit me proper lists of the names of all the com∣missioned officers, and of their ranks and the corps they belong to; also the number of non-commissioned and privates, and their res∣pective regiments. You will perceive by his letter, he supposes me to have affected some delay, or to have been unmindful of the proposition I had made.</P>
<P>I propose to stay in this neighborhood a few days, in which time I expect the designs of the enemy will be more disclosed, and their incursions be made in this quarter, or their investiture of Fort Wash∣ington, if they are intended.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you last, an important event has taken place, of which I wish to give you the earliest intelligence.</P>
<P>The preservation of the passage of the North-river was an object of so much consequence that I thought no pains or expense too great for that purpose: and therefore, after sending off all the valuable stores except such as were necessary for its defence, I determined, agreeable to the advice of most of the general officers, to risk something to defend the post on the east side, called Mount-Washington.</P>
<P>When the army moved up in consequence of general Howe's landing at Frog-Point, colonel Magaw was left on that command, with about twelve hundred men, and orders given to de∣fend it to the last. Afterwards, reflecting upon the smallness of the garrison, and the difficulty of their holding it if general Howe should fall down upon it with his whole force, I wrote to general Greene who had the command on the Jersey shore, directing him to govern himself by circumstances, and to retain or evacuate the post as he should think best, and revoking the absolute order to colonel Magaw to defend the post to the last ex∣tremity.—General Greene, struck with the importance of the post, and the disengagement which our evacuation of posts must necessarily have given, reinforced colonel Magaw with de∣tachments from several regiments of the flying camp, but chiefly of Pennsylvania, so as to make up the number about two thousand.</P>
<P>In this situation things were yesterday, when general Howe de∣manded the surrendry of the garrison, to which colonel Magaw re∣turned a spirited refusal. Immediately upon receiving an ac∣count of this transaction, I came from Hackinsac to this place, and had partly crossed the North-river when I met general Putnam and general Greene, who were just returning from thence, and informed me that the troops were in high spi∣rits, and would make a good defence: and it being late at night, I returned.</P>
<P>Early this morning colonel Magaw posted his troops partly in the lines thrown up by our army on our first coming thither from New-York, and partly on a commanding hill lying north of Mount-Washington,—the lines being all to the southward. In this position the attack began about ten o'clock, which our troops stood, and returned the fire in such a manner as gave me great hopes the enemy was entirely repulsed. But at this
<PB N="259" REF="031423_0259_0FEC5B69AD74BFD0"/>
time a body of troops crossed Haerlem-river in boats and landed inside of the second lines, our troops being then engaged in the first.</P>
<P>Colonel Cadwallader, who commanded in the lines, sent off a detachment to oppose them: but they, being overpowered by numbers, gave way; upon which, colonel Cadwallader order∣ed his troops to retreat in order to gain the fort. It was done with much confusion; and the enemy crossing over came in upon them in such a manner, that a number of them surrender∣ed.</P>
<P>At this time the Hessians advanced on the north side of the fort in a very large body. They were received by the troops posted there, with proper spirit, and kept back a considerable time: but at length they were also obliged to submit to a superi∣ority of numbers, and retire under the cannon of the fort.</P>
<P>The enemy, having advanced thus far, halted; and immedi∣ately a flag went in, with a repetition of the demand of the fortress, as I suppose. At this time I sent a billet to colonel Magaw, directing him to hold out, and I would endeavor this evening to bring off the garrison, if the fortress could not be maintained, as I did not expect it could, the enemy being possess∣ed of the adjacent ground. But, before this reached him he had entered too far into a treaty, to retract; after which, colo∣nel Cadwallader told another messenger who went over, that they had been able to obtain no other terms than to surren∣der as prisoners of war. In this situation matters now stand. I have stopped general Beall's and general Heard's brigades to pre∣serve the post and stores here; which, with the other troops, I hope we shall be able to effect.</P>
<P>I do not yet know the numbers killed or wounded on either side: but, from the heaviness and continuance of the fire in some places, I imagine there must have been considerable execu∣tion.</P>
<P>The loss of such a number of officers and men, many of whom have been trained with more than common attention, will, I fear, be severely felt; but, when that of the arms and accoutre∣ments is added, much more so; and must be a further incentive to procure as considerable a supply as possible for the new troops, as soon as it can be done.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not yet been able to obtain a particular account of the unhappy affair of the sixteenth, nor of the terms on which the garrison surrendered. The intelligence that has come to hand is not so full and accurate as I could wish. One of the artillery, whose information is most direct, and who es∣caped on sunday night, says the enemy's loss was very con∣siderable, especially in the attack made above the fort by the divi∣sion of Hessians that marched from Kingsbridge, and where lieu∣tenant-colonel Rawlins, of the late colonel Stephenson's regiment, was posted.</P>
<P>They burned yesterday one or two houses on the heights, and contiguous to the fort, and appeared, by advices from general Greene, to be moving in the evening their main body down to∣wards the city Whether they will close the campaign without at∣tempting something more, or make an incursion into jersey, must be determined by the events themselves.</P>
<P>As Fort-Lee was always considered as only necessary in con∣junction with that on the east side of the river, to preserve the com∣munication across, and to prevent the enemy from a free na∣vigation, it has become of no importance by the loss of the other, or not so material as to employ force for its defence. Being viewed in this light, and apprehending that the stores there would be precariously situated, their removal has been de∣termined on to Boundbrook above Brunswic, Princeton, Spring∣field, and Aquackenunk-bridge, as places that will not be sub∣ject to sudden danger in case the enemy should pass the riv∣er, and which have been thought proper as repositories for some of our stores of provision and forage.</P>
<P>The troops belonging to the flying camp under generals Heard and Beall, with what remains of general Ewing's brigade, are now at Fort-Lee, where they will continue till the stores are got away. By the time that is effected, their term of enlistment will be near expiring; and, if the enemy should make a push in this quarter, the only troops that there will be to oppose them, will be Hand's, Hazlett's, the regiment from Virginia, and that, lately Smallwood's,—the latter greatly re∣duced by the losses it sustained on Long-Island, &amp;c. and sick∣ness: nor are the rest by any means complete. In addition to these, I am told there are a few of the militia of this state, who have been called in by governor Livingston. I shall make such a disposition of the whole at Brunswic and at the interme∣diate posts, as shall seem most likely to guard against the de∣signs
<PB N="261" REF="031423_0262_0FEC5B6F8551CD18"/>
of the enemy, and to prevent them making an irruption or foraging with detached parties.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter from colonels Miles and Atlee will shew Congress the distressed situation of our prisoners in New-York; and their distress will become greater every day by the cold inclement season that is approaching. It will be happy if some expedient can be adopted, by which they may be furnished with necessary blankets and clothing. Humanity and the good of the service require it.—I think the mode suggested by these gentlemen, for establishing a credit, appears as likely to suc∣ceed, and as eligible, as any that occurs to me. It is probable many articles that may be wanted can be obtained there, and up∣on better terms than elsewhere. In respect to provision, their al∣lowance perhaps is as good as the situation of general Howe's stores will admit of: it has been said of late by deserters and others that they were rather scant.</P>
<P>By a letter from the pay-master-general, of the seventeenth, he says there will be a necessity that large and early remittan∣ces should be made. The demands, when the troops now in service are dismissed, will be extremely great. Besides, the bounty recruits will require a large supply; and he adds that the commissary general has informed him, that, between this and the last of December, he shall have occasion for a million of dol∣lars.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 21.—The unhappy affair of the sixteenth has been succeeded by further misfortunes. Yesterday morning a large body of the enemy landed between Dobbs's ferry and Fort-Lee. Their object was, evidently, to enclose the whole of our troops and stores that lay between the North and Hack∣insac rivers, which form a very narrow neck of land. For this purpose they formed and marched as soon as they had ascended the high grounds towards the fort. Upon the first information of their having landed, and of their movements, our men were ordered to meet them; but finding their num∣bers greatly superior, and that they were extending themselves to seize on the passes over the river, it was thought prudent to withdraw our men; which was effected, and their retreat secured. We lost the whole of the cannon that was at the fort (except two twelve-pounders) and a great deal of baggage, between two and three hundred tents, about a thousand barrels of flour, and other stores in the quarter-master's department. This loss was inevitable. As many of the stores had been remov∣ed as circumstances and time would admit of. The ammunition had been happily got away.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="031423_0263_0FEC5B75497F88A8"/>
Our present situation between Hackinsac and Passaic rivers being exactly similar to our late one, and our force here by no means adequate to an opposition that will promise the smallest pro∣bability of success, we are taking measures to retire over the wa∣ters of the latter, when the best disposition will be formed that circumstances will admit of.</P>
<P>By colonel Cadwallader, who has been permitted by general Howe to return to his friends, I am informed the surrender of the garrison on the sixteenth was on the common terms as pri∣soners of war; the loss of the Hessians, about three hundred privates and twenty-seven officers killed and wounded; about forty of the British troops, and two or three officers: the loss on our side but inconsiderable. I beg leave to refer you to him for a more particular account, and also for his relation of the distresses of our prisoners.—Colonels Miles and Atlee's letter, mentioned above upon this subject, was through mistake sent from hence yesterday morning. The mode of relief proposed by them was a credit or supply of cash through the means of Mr. Franks. This seems to be doubtful, as he is said to be in confine∣ment by colonel Cadwallader,—provided it would have been other∣wise practicable.</P>

<P>I HAVE not yet heard that any provisions is making to supply the place of the troops composing the flying camp, whose departure is now at hand. The situation of our affairs is truly critical, and such as requires uncommon exertions on our part. From the movements of the enemy, and the information we have received, they certainly will make a push to possess them∣selves of this part of the Jersey.—In order that you may be ful∣ly apprised of our weakness, and of the necessity there is of our obtaining early succours, I have by the advice of the general of∣ficers here, directed general Mifflin to wait on you. He is inti∣mately acquainted with our circumstances, and will represent them better than my hurried state will allow.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Lee to come over with the conti∣nental regiments immediately under his command: those with general Heath I have ordered to secure the passes through the
<PB N="263" REF="031423_0264_0FEC5B76D2932080"/>
Highlands. I have also wrote to governor Livingston requesting of him such aid as may be in his power; and would submit it to the consideration of Congress whether application should not be made for part of Pennsylvania militia to step forth at this pres∣sing time.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would mention, if an early and imme∣diate supply of money could be sent to Mr. Dalham to pay the flying-camp troops, it might have a happy effect. They would subsist themselves comfortably on their return, provide many necessaries of which they are in great want; and moreover it might be the means of inducing many, after seeing their friends, to engage again.</P>
<P>I expected, on coming here, to have met with many of the militia, but find from inquiry that there are not more than from four to five hundred at the different posts.</P>

<P>I have nothing in particular to advise you of, respecting the enemy, more than they are advancing this way. Part of them have passed the Passaic; and I suppose the main body that they have on this side the North-river would have done the same before now (as they are coming on), had their progress not been retarded by the weather which has been rainy for several days past, I have scouts and detachments constantly out to harrass them and watch their motions, and to gain, if possible, intelligence of their designs.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honored with your favor of the twenty-sixth, and with its inclosures, by which I perceive the measures that have been adopted for forwarding a reinforcement of militia. Their arrival is much to be wished, the situation of our affairs being truly alarming, and such as demands the earliest aids. As general Mifflin's presence may have a happy influence on the dis∣position and temper of many of the associators, I shall not direct his return so long as he can be done without, and till it becomes indispensably necessary.</P>
<P>On thursday morning I left Newark, and arrived here yester∣day with the troops that were there. It was the opinion of all the generals who were with me, that a retreat to this place was requisite, and founded in necessity, as our force was by no means sufficient to make a stand, with the least probability of success, against an enemy much superior in number, and whose advanced guards were entering the town by the time our rear got out. It was the wish of all to have remained there longer, and to have halted before we came thus far; but, upon due considera∣tion of our strength, the circumstances attending the enlistment of a great part of our little force, and the frequent advices that the enemy were embarking or about to embark another detach∣ment for Staten-Island with a view of landing at Amboy to co∣operate with this, which seemed to be confirmed by the infor∣mation of some persons who came from the island, that they were collecting and impressing all the waggons they could find,—it was judged necessary to proceed till we came here, not only to prevent their bringing a force to act upon our front and rear, but also that we might be more convenient to oppose any troops they might land at South-Amboy, which many conjectured to be an object they had in view. This conjecture too had probability and some advices to support it.</P>
<P>I hoped we should have met with large and early succours by this time; but as yet no great number of the militia of this
<PB N="265" REF="031423_0266_0FEC5B7DB98A4150"/>
state has come in; nor have I much reason to expect that any considerable aid will be derived from the counties which lie be∣yond this river, and in which the enemy are. Their situation will prevent it in a great measure from those parts where they are, provided the inclinations of the people were good. Added to this, I have no assurances that more than a very few of the troops com∣posing the flying camp will remain after the time of their engage∣ment is out: so far from it, I am told that some of general Ew∣ing's brigade, who stand engaged to the first of January, are now going away. If those go whose service expires this day, our force will be reduced to a mere handful.</P>
<P>From intelligence received this morning, one division of the enemy was advancing last night as far as Elizabeth-town, and some of their quarter-masters had proceeded about four or five miles, on this side, to provide barns, &amp;c. for their accommoda∣tion. Other accounts say another division, composed of Hessi∣ans, are on the road through Springfield, and are reported to have reached that place last night. I do not know how far their views extend; but I doubt not, they mean to push eve∣ry advantage resulting from the small number and state of our troops.</P>
<P>I early began to forward part of the stores from this place to∣wards Philadelphia. Many are gone: the rest we are removing, and hope to secure.</P>

<P>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-third instant, which, from the unsettled situation of our affairs, I have not been able to an∣swer before. That of the eighteenth incloses a list of stores [<HI>imported</HI>] in the Hancock-and-Adams continental ship, and car∣ried into Dartmouth in New-England,—with a resolve of Con∣gress to deliver the muskets, powder, lead, and flints, to my or∣der. As the other articles of the cargo will be full as useful
<PB N="266" REF="031423_0267_0FEC5B80E7EDF838"/>
to the army as those included in the resolve, I would advise that directions be given to have the whole cargo removed from Dartmouth to some secure place in the neighborhood of Philadel∣phia, and there deposited till called for. It is by no means proper that so great a quantity of military stores should be lodged with the army, especially at present, as we know not to-day where we shall be obliged to remove to-morrow: and that will in all proba∣bility be the case while the enemy continue with a light army on this side the North-River.</P>
<P>In answer to that part of yours of the nineteenth in which you ask my advice as to the propriety of enlisting prisoners of war, I would just observe, that, in my opinion, it is neither con∣sistent with the rules of war, nor politic: nor can I think, that because our enemies have committed an unjustifiable action, by enticing, and, in some instances, intimidating our men in their service, we ought to follow their example. Before I had the honor of yours on this subject, I had determined to remonstrate to general Howe on this head. As to those few who have al∣ready enlisted, I would not have them again withdrawn and sent in, because they might be subjected to punishment: but I would have the practice discontinued in future. If you will revert to the capitulation of St. John's and Chamblee, you will find an express stipulation against the enlisting the prisoners taken there.</P>
<P>I remarked that the enlistment of prisoners was not a politic step:—my reason is this, that in time of danger I have always observed such persons most backward, for fear (I suppose) of falling into the hands of their former masters, from whom they expect no mercy: and this fear they are apt to communicate to their fellow-soldiers. They are also most ready to desert when any action is expected, hoping, by carrying intelligence, to se∣cure their peace.</P>
<P>I met captain Hesketh on the road; and as the situation of his family did not admit of delay, I permitted him to go imme∣diately to New-York, not having the least doubt but general Howe will make a return of any officer of equal rank who shall be required.</P>

<PB N="267" REF="031423_0268_0FEC5B82C86F2630"/>
the enemy are still advancing, and that their van-guard had proceeded as far as Bonem, a small town about four miles this side of Woodbridge, according to my last intelligence. As to their number, reports are various. Some say they were joined yesterday by a considerable reinforcement from Staten-Island. How far this fact may be true, I cannot determine: but, from every information, before, they were between six and seven thou∣sand strong.</P>
<P>I have for some time past supposed Philadelphia to be the ob∣ject of their movement, and have every reason to believe my opinion well founded,—the advices of sundry persons, who have had an opportunity of mixing and conversing with them on the march, agreeing that such is the report. I have wrote to govern∣or Livingston upon the subject, requesting his utmost exertions to forward on every succour in his power. The same, I trust, will be attended to in Pennsylvania. Without a sufficient number of men and arms, their progress cannot be checked:—at present our force is totally inadequate to any attempt.</P>
<P>Several officers belonging to the enemy, who were prisoners, have obtained permission to return. I have not yet sent in the names of those belonging to us, that are to be exchanged for them. By a Virginia paper, I perceive that captain Morgan and lieutenant Heath, who were taken prisoners at Quebec, and now on parole, are promoted in the late arrangement of officers in that state,—the former to a regiment, the latter to a majority. It would be well if they were released: but being Virginians, and not knowing that any gentleman who were taken at the same time are so circumstanced, I have declined claiming their return without the opinion of Congress, lest I should incur the charge of partiality.</P>
<P>I have sent forward colonel Humpton, to collect proper boats and crafts at the ferry, for transporting our troops: and it will be of infinite importance to have every other craft, besides what he takes for the above purpose, secured on the west side of Dela∣ware: otherwise they may fall into the enemy's hands and facili∣tate their views.</P>

It being impossi∣ble to oppose them with our present force with the least prospect of success, we shall retreat to the west side of Delaware (and have advanced about eight miles) where it is hoped we shall meet a reinforcement sufficient to check their progress.

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you yesterday, I recei∣ved a letter from General Lee. On the thirtieth ultimo he was at Peekskill, and expected to pass the river with his divi∣sion two days after. From this intelligence you will readily conclude that he will not be able to afford us any aid for several days. The report of general St. Clair's having joined them with three or four regiments, I believe to be altogether premature, as he mentions nothing of it. It has arisen, as I am inform∣ed, from the return of some of the Jersey and Pennsylvania troops from Tyconderoga, whose time of service is expired. They have reached Pluckemin where I have wrote to have them halted and kept together, if they can be prevailed on, till further orders.</P>
<P>The inclosed is a copy of a letter which came to hand last night from major Clark, to which I beg leave to refer you for the intelligence it contains.—The number of the enemy said to be embarked is supposed to be rather exaggerated.

By colonel Griffin, who went from Brunswic on sunday morning with a captain Sims, to pass him by our guards, and who was detained by lord Cornwallis till monday evening, on account of his situation, the amount of general Clinton's force, from what he could collect from the officers, was about six thousand: as to their destination, he could not obtain the least information. By him I also learn the enemy were in Brunswic, and that some of their advanced parties had proceeded two miles on this side. The heavy rain that has fallen has probably checked their progress, and may prevent their frther movement for some time,</P>

<P>AS nothing but necessity obliged me to retire before the enemy and leave so much of the Jerseys unprotected, I conceive it my duty, and it corresponds with my inclination, to make head against them so soon as there shall be the least probability of doing it with propriety. That the country might in some measure be covered, I left two brigades consisting of the five Virginia regiments and that of Delaware, containing in the whole about twelve hundred men fit for duty, under the com∣mand of lord Sterling and general Stephen, at Princeton, till the baggage and stores could cross the Delaware, or the troops under their respective commands should be forced from thence. I shall now, having removed the greatest part of the above ar∣ticles, face about with such troops as are here fit for service, and march back to Princeton, and there govern myself by cir∣cumstances and the movements of general Lee. At any event, the enemy's progress may be retarded by this means, if they intend to come on, and the people's fears in some measure qui∣eted, if they do not. Sorry I am to observe, however, that the frequent calls upon the militia of this state, the want of ex∣ertion in the principal gentlemen of the country, or a fatal su∣pineness and insensibility of danger till it is too late to prevent an evil that was not only foreseen but foretold, have been the causes of our late disgraces.</P>
<P>If the militia of this state had stepped forth in season (and timely notice they had), we might have prevented the enemy's crossing the Hackinsac, although without some previous notice of the time and place it was impossible to have done this at the North-river. We might with equal probability of success have made a stand at Brunswic on the Rariton. But as both these rivers were fordable in a variety of places (knee-deep only), it required many men to defend the passes; and these we had not. At Hackinsac our force was insufficient, because a part was at Elizabeth-town, Amboy, and Brunswic, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uarding a coast which I thought most exposed to danger; and at Brunswic, because I was disappointed in my expectation of militia, and because on the day of the enemy's approach (and probably the occasion of it) the term of the Jersey and Maryland brigade' service expired; neither of which would consent to stay an hour lon∣ger.</P>
<P>These among ten thousand other instances, might be adduced to shew the disadvantages of short enlistments, and the little de∣pendence upon militia in times of real danger. But, as yester∣day
<PB N="273" REF="031423_0272_0FEC5B9999A00B18"/>
cannot be recalled, I will not dwell upon a subject which, no doubt, has given much uneasiness to Congress, as well as ex∣treme pain and anxiety to myself. My first wish is that Con∣gress may be convinced of the impropriety of relying upon the mi∣litia, and of the necessity of raising a larger standing army than what they have voted. The saving in the articles of stores, provisions, and in a thousand other things, by having nothing to do with the militia unless in case of extraordinary exigency, and such as could not be expected in the common course of events, would amply support a large army, which, well officered, would be daily improving, instead of continuing a destructive, expensive, and disorderly mob.</P>
<P>I am clear in opinion, that, if forty thousand men had been kept in constant pay since the first commencement of hostilities, and the militia had been excused doing duty during that period, the continent would have saved money. When I reflect on the losses we have sustained for want of good troops, the certainty of this is placed beyond a doubt of my mind. In such case, the militia, who have been harrassed and tired by repeated calls upon them (and farming and manufactures in a manner suspended), would, upon any pressing emergency, have ran with alacri∣ty to arms; whereas the cry now is, "they may be as well ruined one way as another;" and with difficulty they are obtained.</P>
<P>I mention these things, to shew, that, in my opinion, if any dependence is placed in the militia another year, Congress will be deceived. When danger is a little removed from them, they will not turn out at all. When it comes home to them, the well-affected; instead of flying to arms to defend themselves, are busily employed in removing their families and effects,—whilst the disaffected are concerting measures to make their submission, and spread terror and dismay all around, to induce others to follow the example.—Daily experience and abundant proofs warrant this information.</P>
<P>I shall this day reinforce lord Sterling with about twelve hun∣dred men, which will make his number about two thousand four hundred. To-morrow I mean to repair to Princeton myself, and shall order the Pennsylvania troops (who are not yet arrived, ex∣cept part of the German battalion and a company of light infantry) to the same place.</P>
<P>By my last advices, the enemy are still at Brunswic; and the account adds that general Howe was expected at Elizabeth∣town with a reinforcement, to erect the king's standard, and demand a submission of this state. I can only give this as a re∣port

<P>COLONEL Reed would inform you of the intelligence which I first met with on the road from Trenton to Princeton yes∣terday. Before I got to the latter, I received a second ex∣press informing me, that as the enemy were advancing by different routes, and attempting by one to get in the rear of our troops which were there (and whose numbers were small, and the place by no means defensible), they had judged it prudent to re∣treat to Trenton. The retreat was accordingly made, and since to this side of the river.</P>
<P>This information I thought it my duty to communicate as soon as possible, as there is not a moment's time to be lost in assembling such force as can be collected; and as the object of
<PB N="275" REF="031423_0274_0FEC5B9FA59838C8"/>
the enemy cannot now be doubted in the smallest degree. Indeed I shall be out of my conjecture (for it is only conjecture) if the late embarkation at New-York is not for Deleware river, to co∣operate with the army under the immediate command of general Howe, who I am informed from good authority, is with the British troops and his whole force upon this route.</P>
<P>I have no certain intelligence of general Lee, although I have sent frequent expresses to him, and lately a colonel Humpton to bring me some accurate accounts of his situation. I last night dis∣patched another gentleman to him (major Hoops) desiring he would hasten his march to the Deleware, in which I would provide boats near a place called Alexandria, for the trans∣portation of his troops.—I cannot account for the slowness of his march.</P>
<P>In the disordered and moving state of the army, I cannot get returns: but from the best accounts, we had between three thou∣sand and three thousand five hundred men, before the Philadelphia militia and German battallion arrived: they amount to about two thousand.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I did myself the honor of writing to you yesterday, and in∣forming you that I had removed the troops to this side of the De∣laware. Soon after the enemy made their appearance, and their van entered just as our rear guard quitted. We had removed all our stores, except a few boards.—From the best information, they are in two bodies, one at and near Trenton, the other some miles higher up, and inclining towards Delaware; but whether with intent to cross there, or throw themselves between general Lee and me, is yet uncertain.</P>
<P>I have this morning detached lord Stirling with his brigade, to take post at the different landing places, and prevent them from stealing a march upon us from above; for I am informed, if they cross at Coryel's ferry or thereabouts, they are as near to Phila∣delphia, as we are here. From several accounts I am led to think that the enemy are bringing boats with them: if so it will be im∣possible for our small force to give them any considerable op∣position in the passage of the river, [<HI>as they may</HI>] make a feint at one place, and, by a sudden removal, carry their boats higher or lower before we can bring our cannon to play upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="031423_0275_0FEC5BA2B71E5618"/>
Under these circumstances, the security of Philadelphia should be our next object. From my own remembrance, but more from information (for I never viewed the ground) I should think that a communication of lines and redoubts might soon be form∣ed from the Delaware to Schuylkill on the north entrance of the city, the lines to begin on the Schuylkill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide, about the heights of Springatebury, and run eastward to Delaware, upon the most advantageous and commanding grounds. If something of this kind is not done, the enemy might, in case any misfortune should befal us, march directly, in and take possession. We have ever found that lines, however slight, are very formidable to them: they would at least give a check till people could recover of the fright and consternation that naturally attends the first appearance of an enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time every step should be taken to collect force, not only from Pennsylvania, but from the most neighborly states. If we can keep the enemy from entering Philadelphia, and keep the communication by water open for supplies, we may yet make a stand, if the country will come to our assistance till our new levies can be collected.</P>
<P>If the measure of fortifying the city should be adopted, some skilful person should immediately view the grounds, and begin to trace out the lines and works. I am informed there is a French engineer of eminence in Philadelphia at this time: if so he will be the most proper.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER I had wrote you yesterday, I received certain in∣formation that the enemy, after repairing Crofwix's bridge, had advanced a party of about five hundred to Bordentown. By their taking this route, it confirms me in my opinion, that they have an intention to land between this and Philadelphia, as well as above, if they can procure boats for that purpose.</P>
<P>I last night directed commodore Seymour to station all his gallies betweed Bordentown and Philadelphia, to give the ear∣liest intelligence of any appearance of the enemy or the Jersey shore.</P>
<P>I yesterday rode up the river about eleven miles, to lord Sterling's post, where I found a prisoner of the forty-second re∣giment who had been just brought in. He informed me that lord Cornwallis was at Pennytown with two battalions of gre∣nadiers, and three of light infantry, all British, the Hessian grenadiers, the forty-second Highland regiment, and two other battalions, the names of which he did not remember. He knew nothing of the reasons of their being assembled there, nor what were their future intentions. But I last night received informa∣tion from lord Sterling, which had been brought in by his scouts, which in some measure accounted for there being there. They had made a forced march from Trenton on sunday night, to Coryel's ferry, in hopes of surprising a sufficient number of boats to transport them; but, finding themselves disappointed, had marched back to Pennytown, where they remained yester∣day.
<PB N="278" REF="031423_0277_0FEC5BABEEE0A028"/>
From their several attempts to seize boats, it does not look as if they had brought any with them, as I was at one time informed. I last night sent a person over to Trenton, to learn whether there was any appearance of building any: but he could not perceive any preparations for a work of that kind; so that I am in hopes, if proper care is taken to keep all the craft out of their way, they will find the crossing Delaware a matter of considerable difficulty.</P>
<P>I received another letter from general Lee last evening; it was dated at Chatham (which I take to be near Morristown) the eighth of this month. He had then received my letter sent by major Hoops, but seemed still inclined to hang upon the enemy's rear, to which I should have no objection, had I a sufficient force to oppose them in front: but as I have not at present, nor do I see much probability of further reinforcement, I have wrote to him in the most pressing terms, to join me with all expedition.</P>
<P>Major Shelden, who commands the volunteer horse from Connecticut, waits upon Congress to establish some mode of pay. I can only say that the service of himself and his troop has been such as merits the warmest thanks of the public, and deserves a handsome compensation for their trouble. Whate∣ver is settled now, will serve for a precedent in future.—From the experience I have had, this campaign, of the utility of horse, I am convinced there is no carrying on the war without them; and I would therefore recommend the establishment of one or more corps (in proportion to the number of foot) in addition to those already raised in Virginia. If major Shelden would un∣dertake the command of a regiment of horse on the continental establishment, I believe he could very soon raise them; and I can recommend him as a man of activity and spirit, from what I have seen of him.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night received the favor of Mr. Thompson's letter inclosing the proceedings of Congress, of the eleventh instant.—As the publication of their resolve, in my opinion, will not lead to any good end, but, on the contrary, may be at∣tended with some bad consequences, I shall take the liberty to decline inserting it in this day's orders. I am persuaded, if the subject is taken up and reconsidered, that Congress will
<PB N="279" REF="031423_0278_0FEC5BAD9455B040"/>
concur with me in sentiment. I doubt not but there are some who have propagated the report: but what if they have?—Their remaining in or leaving Philadelphia must be governed by circumstances and events. If their departure should become necessary, it will be right: on the other hand if there should not be a necessity for it, they will remain, and their continu∣ance will shew the report to be the production of calumny and falsehood. In a word, sir, I conceive it a matter that may be as well disregarded; and that the removal or staying of Congress, depending entirely upon events, should not have been the subject of a resolve.</P>
<P>The intelligence we obtain respecting the movements and si∣tuation of the enemy is far from being so certain and satisfac∣tory as I could wish, though every probable means in my pow∣er, and that I can devise, are adopted for that purpose. The latest I have received was from lord Sterling, last night. He says that two grenadiers of the Inniskillen regiments, who were taken and brought in by some countrymen, inform that gene∣rals Howe, Cornwallis, Vaughan, &amp;c. with about six thousand of the flying army, were at Pennytown, waiting for pontoons to come up, with which they mean to pass the river near the Blue Mountains, or at Coryel's ferry,—they believe the latter:—that the two battallions of guards were at Brunswic, and the Hessian gre∣nadiers, chasseurs, and a regiment or two of the British troops, are at Trenton.</P>
<P>Captain Miller of colonel Hand's regiment also informs me, that a body of the enemy were marching to Burlington yester∣day morning. He had been sent over with a strong scouting party, and, at day-break, fell in with their advanced guards consisting of about four hundred Hessian troops, who fired upon him before they were discovered, but without any loss, and ob∣liged him to retreat with his party and to take boat. The number of the whole he could not ascertain: but it appeared to be considerable. Captain Miller's account is partly con∣firmed by commodore Seymour, who reports that four or five hundred of the enemy had entered the town. Upon the whole, there can be no doubt but that Philadelphia is their object, and that they will pass the Delaware as soon as possible. Happy should I be if I could see the means of preventing them: at present, I confess, I do not. All military writers agree that it is a work of great difficulty, nay, impracticable, where there is any extent of coast to guard. This is the case with us; and we have to do it with a force, small and inconsiderable, and much inferior to that of the enemy. Perhaps Congress have
<PB N="280" REF="031423_0279_0FEC5BAF2A9DBE88"/>
some hope and prospect of reinforcements: I have no intelligence of the sort, and wish to be informed on the subject. Our little handful is daily decreasing by sickness and other causes: and, without aid, without considerable succours and exertions on the part of the people, what can we reasonably look for or expect, but an event that will be severely felt by the com∣mon cause, and that will wound the heart of every virtuous American,—the loss of Philadelphia? The subject is disa∣greeable, but yet it is true. I leave it, wishing that our situation may become such as to do away the apprehensions which at this time seem to fill the minds of too many, and with too much justice.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heath, dated at Peekskill, the eighth, I am advised that lieutenant-colonel Vose was then there with Greaton's, Bond's, and Porter's regiments, amounting in the whole to between five and six hundred men, who were coming this way. He adds that generals Gates and Arnold would be at Go∣shen that night, with Stark's, Poor's, and Read's regiments; but for what purpose, he does not mention.</P>
<P>The inclosed extract of a letter which I received last night contains intelligence of an agreeable nature. I wish to hear its confirmation by the arrival of the several prizes: that with clo∣thing and arms will be an invaluable acquisition.</P>
<P>I shall be glad to be advised of the mode I am to observe in paying the officers; whether they are to be allowed to draw the pay lately established, and from what time, or how long they are to be paid under the old establishment. A pay-roll which was presented yesterday, being made up for the new, has given rise to these propositions. Upon my objecting to it, I was told that Congress or the board of war had established the prece∣dent, by paying the sixth regiment of Virginia troops commanded by colonel Buckner, agreeable to the latter, as they came through Philadelphia.</P>

<P>THE apparent designs of the enemy being to avoid this ferry, and land their troops above and below us, have induced me to remove from this place the greater part of the troops, and throw them into a different disposition on the river, where∣by I hope not only to be more able to impede their passage, but, also to avoid the danger of being inclosed in this angle of
<PB N="281" REF="031423_0280_0FEC5BB71B70D760"/>
the river. And notwithstanding the extended appearances of the enemy on the other side, made, at least in part, to divert our attention from any particular point as well as to harrass us by fatigue, I cannot divest myself of the opinion that their principal design is to ford the river somewhere above Trenton; to which design I have had particular respect in the new arrangement, wherein I am so far happy as to have the concurrence of the gene∣ral officers at this place.</P>
<P>Four brigades of the army, under generals lord Sterling, Mer∣cer, Stephen and De Fermoy, extend from Yardley's up to Coryel's ferry, posted in such a manner as to guard every suspicious part of the river, and to afford assistance to each other in case of attack. General Ewing, with the flying camp of Pennsylvania and a few Jersey troops under general Dickinson, are posted from Yardley's ferry down to the ferry opposite Bordentown. Colonel Cadwalladar, with the Pennsylvania militia, occupies the ground above and below the mouth of Neshaminy river as far down as Dunk's ferry, at which place colonel Nixon is posted with the third battalion of [<HI>Pennsylvania</HI>]. A proper quantity of artillery is appointed to each brigade; and I have ordered small redoubts to be thrown up opposite every place where there is a possibility of fording.—I shall remove further up the river to be near the main body of my small army, with which every possible opposition shall be given to any further approach of the enemy towards Philadel∣phia.</P>
<P>As general Armstrong has a good deal of influence in this state, and our present force is small and inconsiderable, I think he cannot be better employed than to repair to the counties where his interest lies, to animate the people, promote the re∣cruiting service, and encourage the militia to come in. He will also be able to form a proper judgment of the places suit∣able for magazines of provision to be collected. I have request∣ed him to wait upon Congress on this subject; and if general Smallwood should go to Maryland on the same business, I think it will have a happy effect: he is popular and of great influence, and, I am persuaded, would contribute greatly to that state's furnishing her quota of men in a little time. He is now in Phila∣delphia.</P>

<P>IN a letter which I had the honor of addressing you, I took the liberty to recommend that more battalions should be raised for the new army than what had been voted. Having fully considered the matter, I am more and more convinced not only of the propriety but of the necessity of the measure. That the enemy will leave nothing unessayed in the course of the next campaign to reduce these states to the rule of the most * * *, must be obvious to every one; and that the militia is not to be depended on, or aid expected from them but in cases of the most pressing emergency, is not to be doubted. The first of these propositions is unquestionable, and fatal experience has given her sanction to the truth of the latter: indeed their le∣thargy of late, and backwardness to turn out at this alarming crisis, seem to justify an apprehension that nothing can bring them from their homes. For want of their assistance, a large part of Jersey has been exposed to ravage and to plunder; nor do I know that Pennsylvania would share a better fate, could general
<PB N="283" REF="031423_0282_0FEC5BBEB7524EC8"/>
Howe effect a passage across the Delaware with a respectable force. These considerations have induced me to wish that no reliance, except such as may arise from necessity, should ever be had in them again; and to make further mention to Congress of the expediency of increasing their army.—I trust the measures will meet the earliest attention.</P>
<P>Had I leisure and were it necessary, I could say much upon this head: but, as I have not, and the matter is well understood I will not add much. By augmenting the number of your battali∣ons, you will augment your force: the officers of each will have their interest and influence; and, upon the whole, their numbers will be much greater, though they should not be com∣plete. Added to this, from the present confused state of Jersey, and the improper appointment of officers in many instances, I have little or no expectation that she will be able to raise all the troops exacted from her, though I think it might be done, were suitable spirited gentlemen commissioned, who would exert themselves, and encourage the people, many of whom (for a failure in this instance, and who are well disposed) are making their submissions.—In a word, the next will be a trying campaign: and as all that is dear and valuable may depend upon the issue of it, I would ad∣vise that nothing should be omitted, that shall seem necessary to our success. Let us have a respectable army, and such as will be competent to every exigency.</P>
<P>I will also add that the critical situation of our affairs, and the dissolution of our present force (now at hand), require that every nerve and exertion be employed for recruiting the new battalions. One part of general Howe's movements at this time, I believe, is with a design to distract us and prevent this business. If the inclemency of the weather should force him into winter quarters, he will not remain there longer than ne∣cessity shall oblige him: he will commence his operations in a short space of time: and in that time our levies must be made up, to oppose him, or I fear the most melancholy of all events must take place.</P>
<P>The inclosed extract of a letter from the commissary-general will shew his demands for money, and his plans for procuring salted provisions and a quantity of flour from the southward. The whole is submitted to the consideration of Congress: and I wish the result of their opinion to be transmitted him, with such supplies of money as may be necessary for himself and the departments he mentions.</P>
<P>The clothing of the troops is a matter of infinite importance, and, if it could be accomplished, would have a happy effect.
<PB N="284" REF="031423_0283_0FEC5BC1FB15AFC8"/>
Their distresses are extremely great, many of them being entirely naked, and most so thinly clad as to be unfit for service.

I cannot attend to the business my∣self, having more than I can possibly do besides.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE waited with much impatience to know the de∣terminations of Congress on the propositions made some time in October last for augmenting our corps of artillery and estab∣lishing a corps of engineers. The time is come when the first cannot be delayed without the greatest injury to the safety of these states; and therefore, under the resolution of Congress bearing date the twelfth instant, at the repeated instances of colo∣nel Knox, and by the pressing advice of all the general officers now here, I have ventured to order three battalions of artillery to be immediately recruited. These are two less than colonel Knox re∣commends, as you will see by his plan inclosed: but then this scheme comprehends all the United States, whereas some of the states have corps already established, and these three battalions are indispensably necessary for the operations in this quarter, including the northern department.</P>
<P>The pay of our artillerists bearing no proportion with that in the English or French service,—the murmuring and disatisfac∣tion thereby occasioned, and the absolute impossibility (as I am told) of getting them upon the old terms,—and the unavoidable necessity of obtaining them at all events,—have induced me (also by advice) to promise officers and men that their pay should be augmented twenty-five per cent, or that their engage∣ments should become null and void. This may appear to Con∣gress premature and unwarrantable. But, sir, if they view our situation in the light it strikes their officers, they will be con∣vinced of the utility of the measure, and that the execution could not be delayed till after their meeting at Baltimore. In short, the present exigency of our affairs will not admit of de∣lay either in council or the field: for well convinced I am, that if the enemy go into quarters at all, it will be for a short season. But I rather think the design of general Howe is to possess him∣self of Philadelphia this winter if possible; and in truth I do not see what is to prevent him, as ten days more will put an end
<PB N="285" REF="031423_0284_0FEC5BC4046F5488"/>
to the existence of our army. That one great point is to keep us as much harrassed as possible, with a view to injure the recruit∣ing service and hinder a collection of stores and other neces∣saries for the next campaign, I am as clear in, as I am of my existence. If therefore, [<HI>when</HI>] we have to provide this short interval, and make these great and ardent preparations,—every matter that in its nature is self-evident is to be referred to Congress at the distance of a hundred and thirty or forty miles, so much time must necessarily elapse, as to defeat the end in view.</P>
<P>It may be said that this is an application for powers that are too dangerous to be entrusted. I can only add that desperate diseases require desperate remedies; and with truth declare that I have no lust after power, but wish with as much fervency as any man upon this wide-extended continent, for an oppor∣tunity of turning the sword into a plough-share. But my feelings, as an officer and a man, have been such as to force me to say that no person ever had a greater choice of difficulties to con∣tend with than I have.—It is needless to add, that short enlist∣ments, and a mistaken dependence upon militia, have been the origin of all our misfortunes and the great accumulation of our debt.</P>
<P>We find, sir, that the enemy are daily gathering strength from the dissaffected. This strength, like a snow-ball, by rolling, will increase, unless some means can be devised to check effec∣tually the progress of the enemy's arms. Militia may possibly do it for a little while: but in a little while also, the militia of those states which have been frequently called upon will not turn out at all; or, if they do, it will be with so much reluct∣ance and sloth, as to amount to the same thing:—instance, New∣Jersey!—witness Pennsylvania!—Could any thing but the river Delaware have saved Philadelphia?—Can any thing (the exige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the case indeed may justify it) be more destructive to the recr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ing service, than giving ten dollars bounty for six weeks' service of the militia, who come in, you cannot tell how,—go, you can not tell when,—and act, you cannot tell where—consume you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> provisions, exhaust your stores, and leave you at last at a criti∣cal moment?</P>
<P>These, sir, are the men I am to depend upon, ten days hence: this is the basis on which your cause will and must forever de∣pend, till you get a large standing army sufficient of itself to op∣pose the enemy. I therefore beg leave to give it as my hum∣ble opinion, that eighty-eight battalions are by no means equal to the opposition you can make, and that a moment's time is not
<PB N="286" REF="031423_0285_0FEC5BC7A102DDE0"/>
to be lost in raising a greater number,—not less in my opinion and the opinion of my officers, than a hundred and ten. It may be urged that it will be found difficult enough to complete the first number. This may be true, and yet the officers of a hun∣dred and ten battalions will recruit a great many more men, than those of eighty-eight. In my judgment this is not a time to stand upon expence: our funds are the only object of consi∣deration. The state of New-York have added one battalion (I wish they had made it two) to their quota.—If any good offi∣cers offer to raise men upon continental pay and establishment in this quarter, I shall encourage them to do so, and regiment them when they have done it. If Congress disapprove of this proceeding, they will please to signify it, as I mean it for the best.</P>
<P>It may be thought that I am going a good deal out of the line of my duty, to adopt these measures, or to advise thus free∣ly. A character to lose,—an estate to forfeit,—the inestimable blessings of liberty at stake,—and a life devoted,—must be my ex∣cuse.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing of the light-horse from Virginia, nor the regiment from the Eastern-Shore. I wish to know what troops are to act in the different departments, and to have those from the southward (designed for this place) ordered on as fast as they shall be raised. The route should be pointed out by which they are to march; assistant-commissaries and quarter∣masters upon the communication, to supply their wants: the first or second officer of each battalion to forward them, and the other to come on, receive and form them at their place of destination. Unless this is immediately set about, the campaign, if it should be closed, will be opened in the spring before we have any men in the field.</P>
<P>Every exertion should be used to procure tents: a clothier-general should be appointed without loss of time, for supplying the army with every article in that way:—he should be a man of business and abilities. A commissary of prisoners must be appointed to attend the army:—for want of an officer of this kind, the exchange of prisoners has been conducted in a shame∣ful and injurious manner. We have had them from all quarters pushed into our camps at the most critical junctures, and with∣out the least previous notice. We have had them travelling through the different states in all directions by certificates from committees, without any kind of controul; and have had instan∣ces of some going into the enemy's camp without my privity or knowledge, after passing in the manner before mentioned.—
<PB N="287" REF="031423_0286_0FEC5BCA117F5EC0"/>
There may be other officers necessary which I do not recollect at this time, and which, when thought of, must be provided: for this, sir, you may rely on, that the commanding officer, under the present establishment, is obliged to attend to the business of so ma∣ny different departments, as to render it impossible to conduct that of his own with the attention necessary;—than which, nothing can be more injurious.</P>
<P>In a former letter, I intimated my opinion of the necessity of having a brigadier for every three regiments, and a major gene∣ral to every three brigades, at most. I think no time is to be lost in making the appointments, that the arrangements may be consequent. This will not aid the recruiting service, but will be the readiest means of forming and disciplining the army afterwards, which, in the short time we have to do it, is of amazing consequence. I have labored ever since I have been in the service, to discourage all kinds of local attachments and dis∣tinctions of country, denominating the whole by the greater name of '<HI>American:</HI>' but I found it impossible to overcome prejudices: and, under the new establishment, I conceive it best to stir up an emulation; in order to do which, would it not be bet∣ter for each state to furnish (though not to appoint) their own brig∣adiers?—This, if known to be part of the establishment, might prevent a good deal of contention and jealousy; and would, I be∣lieve, be the means of promotions going forward with more satis∣faction, and quiet the higher officers.</P>
<P>Whilst I am speaking of promotions, I cannot help giving it as my opinion, that, if Congress think proper to confirm what I have done with respect to the corps of artillery, colonel Knox (at present at the head of that department, but who, without promotion, will resign) ought to be appointed to the command of it, with the rank and pay of brigadier. I have also to mention, that, for want of some establishment in the department of engi∣neers agreeable to the plan laid before Congress in October last, colonel Putnam, who was at the head of it, has quitted, and taken a regiment in the state of Massachusetts. I know of no other man tolerable well qualified for the conducting of that business. None of the French gentlemen whom I have seen with appoint∣ments in that way appear to me to know any thing of the matter. There is one in Philadelphia, who I am told, is clever: but him I have never seen.</P>
<P>I must also once more beg leave to mention to Congress the expediency of letting promotions be in a regimental line. The want of this has already driven some of the best officers that were in your army, out of the service. From repeated and
<PB N="288" REF="031423_0287_0FEC5BCC419067E8"/>
strict enquiry I am convinced you can adopt no mode of promotion that will be better received, or that will give more general satisfac∣tion. I wish therefore to have it announced.</P>
<P>The casting of cannon is a matter that ought not to be one mo∣ment delayed: and therefore I shall send colonel Knox to put this in a train, as also to have travelling carriages and shot provided,—elaboratories to be established, one in Hart∣ford, and another in York. Magazines of provisions should al∣so be laid in. These I shall fix with the commissary. As our great loss last year proceeded from a want of teams, I shall di∣rect the quarter-master-general to furnish a certain number to each regiment to answer the common purposes thereof, that the ar∣my may be enabled to remove from place to place differently from what we have done, or could do, this campaign. Ammu∣nition carts, and proper carts for entrenching tools, should also be provided, and I shall direct about them accordingly. Above all a store of small arms should be provided, or men will be of little use. The consumption and waste of these, this year, has been great:—militia, flying-camp men, &amp;c. coming in without, were obliged to be furnished, or become useless. Ma∣ny of these threw their arms away: some lost them, whilst others deserted, and took them away. In a word, although I used every precaution to preserve them, the loss has been great; and this will forever be the case in such a mixed and irregular army as ours has been.</P>
<P>If no part of the troops already embarked at New-York has appeared in Virginia, their destination doubtless must be to some other quarter; and that state must, I should think be freed from any invasion, if general Howe can be effectually opposed in this. I therefore inclose a memorandum given me by brigadier Stephen of Virginia, which Congress will please to adopt in the whole,—in part,—or reject,—as may be consistent with their plans and intelligence.</P>
<P>The division of the army, late under the command of general Lee, now general Sullivan, is just upon the point of joining us. A strange kind of fatality has attended it. They had orders on the seventeenth of November to join, now more than a month. General Gates, with four eastern regiments, is also near at hand: three others from those states were coming on, by his order, by the way of Peekskill, and had joined general Heath whom I had ordered on with Parson's brigade, to join me, leaving Clinton's brigade and some militia (that were at Forts Montgomery and Constitution) to guard those important passes of the Highlands. But the convention of the state of
<PB N="289" REF="031423_0288_0FEC5BD3F60DC0D8"/>
New-York seeming to be much alarmed at Heath's coming a∣way,—a fleet appearing off New-London,—and some part of the enemy's troops retiring towards Brunswic,—induced me to countermand the order for the march of Parsons's brigade, and to direct the three regiments from Tyconderoga to halt at Mor∣ristown in Jersey (where I understand about eight hundred militia had collected), in order to inspirit the inhabitants, and, as far as possible, cover that part of the country. I shall send general Maxwell this day to take the command of them, and, if to be done, to harrass and annoy the enemy in their quarters, and cut off their convoys.</P>
<P>The care and vigilance, which were used in securing the boats on this river, have hitherto baffled every attempt of the enemy to cross: but, from concurring reports and appearances, they are waiting for ice to afford them a passage.</P>
<P>Since writing the foregoing, I have received a letter from gov∣ernor Cooke of Rhode-Island, of which the inclosed is a copy. Previous to this, and immediately upon the first intelligence ob∣tained of a fleet's going through the Sound, I dispatched orders to generals Spencer and Arnold to proceed without the least delay to the eastward. The first, I presume, is gone: the latter, not get∣ting my letter till he came to a place called Easton, was, by advice of general Gates, who also met my letter at the same place, in∣duced to come on hither before he proceeded to the eastward.—Most of our brigadiers are laid up: not one has come on with the division under general Sullivan, but they are left sick at different places on the road.</P>
<P>By accounts from the eastward, a large body of men had assem∣bled in Rhode-Island, from the states of Massacusetts and Connecticut. I presume (but I have no advice of it) that the mi∣litia ordered from the first, to rendezvous at Danbury (six thousand in number) under the command of major-general Lincoln, for supplying the place of the disbanded men of that state in the continental army, will now be ordered to Rhode-Island.</P>
<P>In speaking of general Lincoln, I should not do him justice, were I not to add that he is a gentleman well worthy of notice in the military line. He commanded the militia from Massachu∣setts last summer, or fall rather, and much to my satisfac∣tion,—having proved himself on all occasions an active, spirited, sensible man. I do not know whether it his wish to re∣main in the military line, or whether, if he should, any thing under the rank he now holds in the state he comes from would satisfy him. How far an appointment of this kind might offend
<PB N="290" REF="031423_0289_0FEC5BD585CDD700"/>
the continental brigadiers, I cannot undertake to say:—many there are, over whom he ought not to be placed; but I know of no way to discriminate.—Brigadier Reed of New-Hamshire does not, I presume, mean to continue in service: he ought not,—as I am told, by the severity of the small-pox, he is become both blind and deaf.</P>

<P>P. S. Generals Gates and Sullivan have this instant come in. By them I learn that few or no men are recruited out of the regi∣ments coming on with them, and that there is very little reason to expect that these regiments will be prevailed upon to continue after their term of service expires. If militia then do not come in, the consequences are but too evident.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT I should dwell upon the subject of our distresses, can∣not be more disagreeable to Congress than it is painful to myself. The alarming situation to which our affairs are reduced, impels me to the measure. Inquiry and investigation,—which in most cases serve to develope and point out a remedy,—in ours, present more and greater difficulties. Till of late I was led to hope from report that no inconsiderable part of the troops composing the regiments that were with general Lee, and those from Tyconderogo under general Gates, had en∣listed again. This intelligence, I confess, gave me reason to expect that I should have at the expiration of the present year, a force somewhat more respectable than what I find will be the case.</P>
<P>Having examined into the state of those regiments, I am au∣thorised to say, from the information of their officers, that but ve∣ry few of the men have enlisted. Those who have, are of the troops from Tyconderoga, and were permitted to visit their friends and homes, as part of the terms on which they would re∣engage. In respect to those who marched with general Lee, I cannot learn that any have. Their refusal, I am told, has not proceeded more from an aversion to the service, or any fixed determination not to engage again, than from their wishes to return home,—the non-appointment of officers in some in∣stances,—the turning out of good, and appointing of bad,—in others, and the incomplete or rather no arrangement of them,—a work unhappily committed to the management of their states: nor have I the most distant prospect of retaining them
<PB N="291" REF="031423_0290_0FEC5BD712F95878"/>
a moment longer than the last of this instant, notwithstanding the most pressing solicitations and the obvious necessity for it.</P>
<P>By the departure of these regiments I shall be left with five from Virginia, Smallwood's from Maryland, a small part of Rawlin's, Hand's from Pennsylvania, a part of Ward's from Con∣necticut, and the German battalion, amounting in the whole at this time from fourteen to fifteen hundred effective men. This handful, and such militia as may chuse to join me, will then com∣pose our army.</P>
<P>When I reflect upon these things they fill me with much concern, knowing that general Howe has a number of troops can∣toned in the towns bordering on and near the Delaware,—his intentions to pass, as soon as the ice is sufficiently formed, to invade Pennsylvania and to possess himself of Philadelphia, if pos∣sible. To guard against his designs and the execution of them, shall employ my every exertion: but how is this to be done? As yet but few militia have gone to Philadelphia, and they are to be our support at this alarming crisis. Had I enter∣tained a doubt of general Howe's intentions to pass the Delaware on the dissolution of our army, and as soon as the ice is made, it would now be done away. An intercepted letter from a gentleman of Philadelphia, (who has joined the enemy), to his friend and partner in the city, declares that to be their design,—that the army would be there in ten or twenty days from the six∣teenth instant, the time of his writing, if the ice should be made;—advises him by no means to remove their stores,—that they would be safe.</P>
<P>The obstacles which have arisen to the raising of the new army, from the mode of appointing the officers, induce me to hope, if Congress resolve on an additional number of battalions to those already voted, that they will devise some other rule by which the officers, especially the field-officers, should be ap∣pointed. In case an augmentation should be made to the eastern regiments, a deviation from the former mode will operate more strongly as to them than to other battalions, because there have been many more officers in service from those states, than the regiments voted to be raised would admit of; by which means several deserving men could not have been provided for, had the utmost pains been used for the purpose; and many others of merit have been neglected in the late appointments, and those of little worth and less experience put in their places or promoted over their heads. This has been the case with many of the best officers.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter from the paymaster-general will shew
<PB N="292" REF="031423_0291_0FEC5BD9133D1838"/>
the state of the military chest, and the necessity of a large and immediate supply of cash. The advances to the officers, for bounty and the recruiting service, are great: besides, the regi∣ments, at the expiration of this month, will require pay of their claims. * * *</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE your obliging favors of the twenty-first and twen∣ty-third. The blankets are come to hand; but I would not have any of the other goods sent on till you hear again from me.</P>
<P>I agree with you that it is vain to ruminate upon, or even re∣flect upon the authors or causes of, our present misfortunes: we should rather exert ourselves, and look forward with hopes that some lucky chance may yet turn up in our favor. Bad as our prospects are, I should not have the least doubt of success in the end, did not the late treachery and defection of those, who stood foremost in the opposition while fortune smiled up∣on us, make me fearful that many more will follow their example, who, by using their influence with some and working upon the fears of others, may extend the circle so as to take in whole towns, counties, nay, provinces. Of this we have a recent instance in Jersey; and I wish many parts in Pennsylvania may not be rea∣dy to receive the yoke.</P>
<P>The security of the continental ships of war in Delaware is cer∣tainly a capital object; and yet to draught the many hands, necessary to fit them out, from the militia, might be dangerous just now: perhaps in a little time hence their places may be supplied with country militia; and then, if the exigency of af∣fairs requires it, they certainly ought to be spared.—I will just hint to you a proposition that was made, or rather talked of, a few days ago by the officers of two New-England regiments whose time of service will expire on the first of January. They
<PB N="293" REF="031423_0292_0FEC47943144D2D0"/>
are most of them water-men: and they say their men would willingly go on board the frigates, and navigate them round to any of the ports in New-England, if it was thought they would be safer there than in Delaware. You may think of this, and let me hear from you on the subject, if the proposition pleases you.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Roger of the navy is already gone in, and I have made a demand of lieutenant Josiah in exchange; but I have not heard whether Lord Howe accedes to it. I will procure the re∣lease of doctor Hodge as soon as it can be done without injuring others by giving him the preference, as I have always made it a rule to demand those first who have been longest in captivity. I will take the same steps in regard to Mr. Jones, commander of the sloop taken by the Andrew Doria.</P>
<P>I shall take the earliest opportunity of sending in your letter to general Lee, with the bill drawn upon major Small.</P>
<P>From an intercepted letter from a person in the secrets of the enemy, I find their intentions are to cross Delaware as soon as the ice is sufficiently strong. I mention this, that you may take the necessary steps for the security of such public and pri∣vate property as ought not to fall into their hands, should they make themselves masters of Philadelphia, of which they do not seem to entertain the least doubt.</P>
<P>I hope the next christmas will prove happier than the pre∣sent, to you, and to, dear sir, your sincere friend and humble servant,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the pleasure of congratulating you upon the suc∣cess of an enterprise which I had formed against a detachment of the enemy lying in Trenton, and which was executed yesterday morning.</P>
<P>The evening of the twenty-fifth I ordered the troops intended for this purpose to parade back of M'Konkey's ferry, that they might begin to pass as soon as it grew dark, imagining that we should be able to throw them all over, with the necessary artillery, by twelve o'clock, and that we might easily arrive at Trenton by five in the morning, the distance being about nine miles. But the quantity of ice, made that night, impeded the passage of the
<PB N="294" REF="031423_0293_0FEC5BE09BFE0018"/>
boats <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o much, that it was three o'clock before the artillery could be all got over; and near four, before the troops took up their line of march.</P>
<P>This made me despair of surprising the town, as I well knew we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke. But as I was certain there was no making a retreat without being dis∣covered, and harrassed on repassing the river, I determined to push on at all events. I formed my detachment in two divisi∣ons, one to march by the lower or river road, the other by the upper or Pennington road. As the divisions had nearly the same distance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately upon forcing the out guards, to push directly into the town, that they might charge the enemy before they had time to form.</P>
<P>The upper division arrived at the enemy's advanced post exact∣ly at eight o'clock; and in three minutes after, I found, from the fire on the lower road, that that division had also got up. The out guards made but small opposition, though for their numbers, they behaved very well, keeping up a constant retreat∣ing fire from behind houses. We presently saw their main body formed; but from their motions, they seemed undetermined how to act.</P>
<P>Being hard pressed by our troops who had already got posses∣sion of their artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on their right, leading to Princeton. But perceiving their inten∣tion, I threw a body of troops in their way; which immediate∣ly checked them. Finding from our disposition, that they were surrounded, and that they must inevitably be cut to pieces if they made any further resistance, they agreed to lay down their arms. The number that submitted in this manner was twenty∣three officers and eight hundred and eighty-six men. Colonel Rahl the commanding officer, and seven others, were found wound∣ed in the town. I do not exactly know how many they had kil∣led; but I faney, not above twenty or thirty, as they never made any regular stand. Our loss is very trifling indeed—only two officers and one or two privates wounded.</P>
<P>I find that the detachment of the enemy consisted of the three Hessian regiments of Lanspach, Kniphausen, and Rhal, amount∣ing to about fifteen hundred men, and a troop of British light∣horse: but, immediately upon the beginning of the attack, all those who were not killed or taken, pushed directly down the road towards Bordentown. These would likewise have fallen into our hands, could my plan have been completely carried in∣to execution. General Ewing was to have crossed before day
<PB N="295" REF="031423_0294_0FEC5BE74E605028"/>
at Trenton ferry, and taken possession of the bridge leading out of town: but the quantity of ice was so great, that, though he did every thing in his power to effect it, he could not get over. This difficulty also hindered general Cadwallader from crossing with the Pennsylvania militia from Bristol. He got part of his foot over: but finding it impossible to embark his artillery, he was obliged to desist.</P>
<P>I am fully confident, that, could the troops under generals Ew∣ing and Cadwallader have passed the river, I should have been able with their assistance to have driven the enemy from all their posts below Trenton. But the numbers I had with me being inferior to theirs below me, and a strong battalion of light infantry being at Princeton above me, I thought it most pru∣dent to return the same evening with the prisoners and the artille∣ry we had taken. We found no stores of any consequence in the town.</P>
<P>In justice to the officers and men, I must add that their beha∣vior upon this occasion, reflects the highest honor upon them. The difficulty in passing the river in a very severe night, and their march through a violent storm of snow and hail, did not in the least abate their ardor: but when they came to the charge, each seemed to vie with the other in pressing forward: and were I to give a preference to any particular corps, I should do great injus∣tice to the others.</P>
<P>Colonel Baylor, my first aid-de-camp, will have the honor of delivering this to you; and from him you may be made acquainted with many other particulars. His spirited behavior up∣on every occasion requires me to recommend him to your particular notice.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM just setting out to attempt a second passage over the Delaware with the troops that were with me on the morning of the twenty-sixth. I am determined to effect it if possi∣ble; but know that it will be attended with much fatigue and dif∣ficulty on account of the ice, which will neither allow us to cross on foot, nor give us an easy passage with boats. General Cadwallader crossed from Bristol on the twenty-seventh, and, by his letter of yesterday, was at Bordentown with about eigh∣teen
<PB N="296" REF="031423_0295_0FEC5BE8D71BD908"/>
hundred men. In addition to these, general Mifflin sent over five hundred from Philadelphia on friday, three hundred yesterday evening from Burlington, and will follow to-day with seven or eight hundred more. I have taken every precaution in my power for subsisting the troops, and shall, without loss of time, and as soon as circumstances will admit of it, pursue the enemy in their retreat,—try to beat up more of their quarters, and, in a word, in every instance, adopt such measures as the exigency of our affairs requires, and our situation will justify.</P>
<P>Had it not been for the unhappy failure of generals Ewing and Cadwallader in their attempts to pass on the night of the twenty-fifth,—and if the several concerted attacks could have been made,—I have no doubt but that our views would have succeeded to our warmest expectations. What was done occasi∣oned the enemy to leave their several posts on the Delaware with great precipitation. The peculiar distresses to which the troops who were with me were reduced by the severities of cold, rain, snow, and storm,—the charge of the prisoners they had taken,—and another reason that might me mentioned,—and the little prospect of receiving succours on account of the season and situ∣ation of the river,—would not authorise a further pursuit at that time.</P>
<P>Since transmitting the list of prisoners, a few more have been discovered and taken in Trenton,—among them a lieutenant-colo∣nel, and a deputy-adjutant-general,—the whole amounting to a∣bout a thousand.</P>
<P>I have been honored with your letter of the twenty-third and its several inclosures, to which I shall pay due attention.—A flag goes in this morning with a letter to general Howe, and another to general Lee. For the latter, Robert Morris, es∣quire has transmitted a bill of exchange, drawn by two British officers, for a hundred and sixteen pounds, nine shillings, and three pence, on major Small, for money furnished them in South-Carolina, which I trust will be paid. This supply is exclusive of the sum you have resolved to be sent him, and which Mr. Morris will procure in time.</P>

<P>P. S. I am under great apprehensions about obtaining pro∣per supplies of provision for our troops: I fear it will be ex∣tremely difficult, if not impracticable, as the enemy, from eve∣ry account, have taken and collected every thing they could find.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR resolves of the twenty-seventh ultimo were transmit∣ted me last night by messieurs Clymer, Morris, and Walton. The confidence which Congress have honored me with by these proceedings, has a claim to my warmest acknowledgments. At the same time I beg leave to assure them that all my faculties shall be employed to direct properly the powers they have been pleased to vest me with, and to adva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, and only those, which gave rise to this honor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> distinction. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y exertions should not be attended with the desired success, I trust the failure will be imputed on the true cause,—the peculi∣arly distressed situation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and the difficulties I have to combat,—rather than to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of zeal for my country, and the closest attention to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, to promote which has ever been my study.</P>
<P>On monday morning I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Delaware myself; the whole of our troops and artillery, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> till yesterday, owing to the ice which rendered their passage extremely difficult and fatiguing. Since their arrival, we have been parading the regiments whose time of service is now expired, in order to know what force we should have to depend on, and how to regulate our views ac∣cordingly. After much persuasion and the exertions of their officers, half or a greater proportion of those from the eastward have consented to stay six weeks on a bounty of ten dollars. I feel the inconvenience of this advance, and I know the conse∣quences which will result from it:—but what could be done?—
<PB N="2" REF="031423_0298_0FEC5C36919BA508"/>
Pennsylvania had allowed the same to her militia:—the troops felt their importance, and would have their price. Indeed, as their aid is so essential, and not to be dispensed with, it is to be wondered they had not estimated it at a higher rate. I per∣ceive that Congress, apprehensive of this event, had made un∣limitted provision for it.</P>
<P>General Mifflin is at Bordentown with about eighteen hun∣dred men, and general Cadwallader at Croswix's, with about the same number.—We are now making our arrangements, and concerting a plan of operations, which I shall attempt to exe∣cute as soon as possible, and which I hope will be attended with some success.</P>
<P>As to the number and situation of the enemy, I cannot ob∣tain certain intelligence: but, from the accounts most to be re∣lied on, they have collected the principal part of their force, from Brunswic and the neighboring posts, at Princeton, where they are throwing up some works. The number there is re∣ported to be from five to six thousand; and it is confidently said they have sent the chief part of their baggage to Brunswic. It is added, that general Howe landed at Amboy a day or two ago with a thousand light troops, and is on his march from thence.</P>
<P>I have sent into different parts of Jersey, men of influence to spirit up the militia, and flatter myself that the many injuries they have received will induce some to give their aid. If what they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> not rouse their resentment, they must not possess <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of humanity. To oppression, ravage, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> property, they have had the more mortifying circumstance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> insult added:—after being stripped of all they had without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> compensation, protections have been granted them for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of their effects.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, since the date of my last from Trenton, I have removed with the army under my
<PB N="3" REF="031423_0299_0FEC5C3847BE5490"/>
command to this place. The difficulty of crossing the Dela∣ware on account of the ice made our passage over it tedious, and gave the enemy an opportunity of drawing in their several cantonments and assembling their whole force at Princeton. Their large picquets, advanced towards Trenton,—their great preparations, and some intelligence I had received,—added to their knowledge that the first of January brought on a dissolu∣tion of the best part of our army,—gave me the strongest rea∣sons to conclude that an attack upon us was meditating.</P>
<P>Our situation was most critical, and our force small. To re∣move immediately was again destroying every dawn of hope which had begun to revive in the breasts of the Jersey militia; and to bring those troops which had first crossed the Delaware and were lying at Croswix's under general Cadwallader, and those under general Mifflin at Bordentown (amounting in the whole to about three thousand six-hundred), to Trenton, was to bring them to an exposed place. One or the other however was unavoidable:—the latter was preferred, and they were or∣dered to join us at Trenton, which they did, by a night-march, on the first instant.</P>
<P>On the second, according to my expectation, the enemy be∣gan to advance upon us; aud, after some skirmishing, the head of their column reached Trenton about four o'clock, whilst their rear was as far back as Maidenhead. They attempted to pass Sanpink creek which runs through Trenton, at different places; but, finding the fords guard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and kindled their fires.—We were drawn up on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> creek.—In this situation we remained till dark, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the enemy, and receiving the fire of their field <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which did us but little damage.</P>
<P>Having by this time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the enemy were greatly superior in number, and that their design was to surround us, I ordered all our bagg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e to be removed silently to Burlington soon after dark; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> o'clock, after renewing our fires and leaving guards at the bridge in Trenton, and other passes on the same stream above, marched by a round-about road to Princeton where I knew they could not have much force left, and might have stores. One thing I was certain of,—that it would avoid the appearance of a retreat (which was of course,—or to run the hazard of the whole army being cut off)—whilst we might by a fortunate stroke withdraw general Howe from Trenton, and give some reputation to our arms.—Happily we succeeded.—We found Princeton about sun-rise with only three
<PB N="4" REF="031423_0300_0FEC5BF44A427AE8"/>
regiments and three troops of light-horse in it, two of which were on their march to Trenton. These three regiments, espe∣cially the two first▪ made a galiant resistance, and, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, must have lost five hundred men: up∣wards of one hundred of them were left dead in the field; and, with what I have with me, and what were taken in the pursuit and carried across the Delaware, there are near three hundred prisoners, fourteen of whom are officers, all British.</P>
<P>This piece of good fortune is counterbalanced by the loss of the brave and worthy general Mercer, colonels Hazlet and Potter, captain Neal of the artillery, captain Fleming who commanded the first Virginia regiment, and four or five other valuable officers, who, with about twenty-five or thirty privates were slain in the field. Our whole loss cannot be ascertained, as many who are in the pursuit of the enemy (who were chased three or four miles) are not yet come in.</P>
<P>The rear of the enemy's army lying at Maidenhead (not more than five or six miles from Princeton) was up with us be∣fore our pursuit was over: but as I had the precaution to destroy the bridge over Stoney-brook (about half a mile from the field of action), they were so long retarded there as to give us time to move off in good order for this place. We took two brass field pieces; but for want of horses could not bring them away. We also took some blankets, shoes, and a few other trif∣fling articles, burned the hay, and destroyed such other things as the shortness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would admit of.</P>
<P>My original <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> out from Trenton, was, to have pushed on to Brunswic: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the harrassed state of our troops (many of them having had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for two nights and a day), and the danger of losing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> we had gained by aiming at too much, induced me by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of my officers, to relin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uish the attempts: but, in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> six or eight hundred fresh troops upon a forced march would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> destroyed all their stores and magazines,—taken (as we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> since learned) their military chest, containing seventy thousand pounds,—and put an end to the war. The enemy from the best intelligence I have been able to get, were so much alarmed at the apprehensi∣on of this, that they marched immediately to Brunswic without halting, except at the bridges (for I also took up those on Mill∣stone, on the different routs to Brunswic), and got there before day.</P>
<P>From the best information I have received, general Howe has left no men either at Trenton or Princeton. The truth of this I am endeavoring to ascertain, that I may regulate my movements accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="031423_0301_0FEC5C3C38B0E0E0"/>
The militia are taking spirits, and, I am told, are coming in fast from this state: but I fear those from Philadelphia will scarcely submit to the hardships of a winter campaign much lon∣ger, especially as they very unluckily sent their blankets with their baggage to Burlington. I must do them the justice however, to add that they have undergone more fatigue and hardship, than I expected militia (especially citizens) would have done at this inclement season.—I am just moving towards Morristown, where I shall endeavor to put them under the best cover I can:—hitherto we have been without any; and many of our poor soldiers barefoot, and ill clad in other re∣spects.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM happy to inform you that the account of general Mercer's death, transmitted in my last, was premature, though it was mentioned as certain by many who saw him after he was wounded. By intelligence from Princeton yesterday evening, he was alive, and seemed as if he would do well:—unhappily he is a prisoner. Had it not been for the information I had of his death, I would have tried to have brought him away, though I believe it could not have beeen effected.</P>
<P>The enemy have totally evacuated. Trent and Princetowns, and are now at Brunswic on the several posts on the communi∣cation between that and Hudso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> river, but chiefly at Bruns∣wic. Their numbers and movements are variously reported: but all agree that their fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>. There have been two or three little skirmishe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> their parties and some de∣tachments of militia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the latter has been successful, and made a few pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. The most considerable was on sun∣day morning near Spring-field, when eight or ten Waldecker<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were killed and woun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and the remainder of the party (thirty-nine or forty) made prisoners, with two officers, by a force not superior in number, and without receiving the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> damage.</P>
<P>The severity of the season has made our troops, especially th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> militia, extremely impatient, and has reduced the number ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> considerably. Every day more or less leave us. Their com∣plaints, and the great fatigues they had undergone, induced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to come to this places, as the best calculated of any in this quar∣ter to accommodate and refresh them.

<P>I AM honored with your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> sixth, inclosing several resolves of Congress respecting an exchange to be proposed be∣tween general Lee and the Hessia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> field <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taken at Tren∣ton. Colonel Ralle died the day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he action; and we left one of the majors so ill of his wound, that I am in doubt of his recovery. I can however make an offer of all that remain, in exchange for general Lee, except one whom you order to be proposed for colonel Allen. If the offer is rejected by ge∣neral Howe, I shall think myself then at liberty to remon∣strate to him on his treatment of general Lee. If he will not exchange him, he should at least admit him to his parole, as we have ever done their prisoners who have fallen into our hands.</P>
<P>I understand from undoubted authority that they intend to
<PB N="7" REF="031423_0303_0FEC5C41F34BD9E8"/>
try the general by a court-martial, as a deserter from their ser∣vice, pretending that his resignation was never accepted of. But I shall inform general Howe, that, if any such step is taken under so shallow and illegal a pretext, and their sentence should extend either to affect his life or liberty, they may depend up∣on the most severe and adequate retaliation upon our part.</P>
<P>The enemy have made no move since my last. By every ac∣count, they begin to be distressed particularly for forage, of which there is little or none remaining in the small circle they possess, except salt hay.</P>
<P>By letters from general Heath, of the ninth, he was begin∣ning to move down towards Kingsbridge with the troops from New-England. This must add to the distress of the enemy, who will, by this measure, be deprived of the subsistence they formerly drew from West-Chester and the counties to the north∣ward of York-Island.</P>

<P>I Embrace this opportunity, by Mr. Hopkins, of inform∣ing you that the enemy remain upon their old ground at Am∣boy and Brunswic. Our accounts still confirm their want of forage, which I hope will increase.—If their horses are reduc∣ed this winter, it will be impossible for them to take the field in the spring.</P>
<P>General Warner, with two regiments from Massachusetts, is arrived here: general Heath, with the remainder of the troops from that state, has by this time began to move down towards Kingsbridge.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, since the date of my last from Trenton, I have removed with the army under my
<PB N="9" REF="031423_0305_0FEC5C01A1A59238"/>
of men, as are colonel Hand's, Smallwood's and the German battalion.—A few days ago general Warner arrived with about seven hundred Massachusetts militia engaged to the fifteenth of March.</P>
<P>Thus you have a sketch of our present army, with which we are obliged to keep up appearances before an enemy already double to us in numbers, and who, from every account are withdrawing their troops from Rhode-Island, to form a juncti∣on of their whole army, and make another attempt either to break up ours, or penetrate towards Philadelphia,—a thing by no means difficult now, as the ice affords an easy passage over the Delaware.</P>
<P>I do not yet know what effect general Heath's moving down towards New-York will have.—Yesterday morning a consider∣able firing was heard, which seemed to be about Kingsbridge. I am in hopes that his appearance on that quarter with a pretty large force will oblige them to withdraw part of theirs from Jersey, to secure the city of New-York, which, by late accounts, is weakly garrisoned.—General Heath has all the eastern and York militia with him, except the small brigade under general Warner which I mentioned before, one regiment of Connecti∣cut, stopped at Providence in Rhode-Island, and a number (how many I do not know) requested by general Schuyler to be sent to Tyconderoga.—If it should appear that they are regardless of the diversion made by general Heath, and presist in their plan of drawing their whole army together in Jersey, I must order him over with all his troops, except as many as are necessary to garrison the forts and guard the passes in the Highlands.</P>
<P>I have ordered away every officer that could be spared,—some to recruit, and some to collect the scattered men of the different regiments, who are dispersed almost over the continent: for, the vast numbers sent to the hospitals at different times, few ever returned after they got well.</P>
<P>As militia must be our dependence till we can get the new army raised and properly arranged, I must entreat you to con∣tinue your endeavours with the state of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, to turn out every man they possibly can, and for some longer time than they have generally stipulated for. If they agree for a month or any limitted time, it should com∣mence from the time they actually join the army, and not from the time they leave their homes: otherwise the marching back∣wards and forwards consumes the term of engagement.</P>
<P>I think these demands of aid should be made as quietly as the nature of the case will admit of, especially at this time
<PB N="10" REF="031423_0306_0FEC5C091C508CE8"/>
when we are deceiving our enemies with false opinions of our numbers: for, to boast of our superiority in that respect on one hand, and to call publicly on the people for assistance on the other, is an impropriety too glaring:—indeed it has been al∣ready noticed in some publications that I have seen from New-York.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM favored with yours of the fifteenth instant, with the sundry resolves inclosed in it. If that respecting the continen∣tal currency is carried strictly into execution, it cannot fail of sully re-establishing its credit.</P>
<P>I have no objection to the three gentlemen who are recom∣mended for field-officers in the new Hampshire regiment: they seem fully entitled to it, as they have raised the regiment. I will furnish them with commissions from the date of their ap∣pointment, when applied to for that purpose.</P>
<P>There is something particular in the application of colonel Dubois and his officers for the sum of five hundred and thirteen dollars and two-thirds. They have been commissioned provid∣ed they should raise the men; but, from their own pay-abstract, it appears that fourteen officers only brought twenty-five men into the field. As they certainly did not comply with their agreement, I would, after stating the matter as it really was, submit it to Congress who have the disposal of the public money.</P>
<P>I have perused the petition of monsieur Faneuil and other French gentlemen. If they could raise such a regiment as they propose, it would certainly be useful: but I have no con∣ception that there are Canadians enough to be sound even for a regiment of the common number, much less of two thousand three hundred and forty-seven, which is the number proposed. I know, neither colonel Livingston nor colonel Hazen could ever complete their Canadian regiments when they had the country open to them. As I would give encouragement to foreigners of real merit, I would put the thing upon this footing:—if monsieur Faneuil can procure a sufficient number of officers to fill a regiment of the common size, and they can give any assurances of being able to raise the men I would grant them commissions.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to remark here, that, except we can throw
<PB N="11" REF="031423_0307_0FEC5C0BCC575128"/>
the many foreigners who have been commissioned in our army, into a corps together, they will be entirely useless, as they can neither converse with officers nor men in any other kind of regi∣ment.</P>
<P>I am so well assured that you would not recommend doctor Potts to succeed doctor Stringer in the northern department except you had sufficient proof of his abilities in the medical line that I readily concur with you in the appointment.</P>
<P>I have received a piece of information which I am afraid is true,—and that is, that the British cruisers have taken a French vessel with a large parcel of cannon and mortars on board. I know such a one was expected, and therefore more readily credit the account.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last to you was on the twentieth instant. Since that, I have the pleasure to inform you that general Dickinson, with about four hundred militia, has defeated a foraging party of the enemy of an equal number, and has taken forty waggons, and upwards of a hundred horses, most of them of the English draft breed, and a number of sheep and cattle which they had collected. The enemy retreated with so much precipitation, that general Dickinson had only an opportunity of making nine prisoners. They were observed to carry off a good many dead and wounded in light waggons.—This action happened near Somerset court-house on Millstone river. General Dickinson's behavior reflects the highest honor upon him: for, though his troops were all raw, he led them through the river middle-deep, and gave the enemy so severe a charge, that, although supported by three field-pieces, they gave way, and left their convoy.</P>
<P>I have not heard from general Heath, since the firing near Kingsbridge last saturday; which I cannot account for, unless the North-river should have been rendered impassible by the ice. But the account of his having surprised and taken Fort-Independence on friday night last comes so well authenticated by different ways, that I cannot doubt it. It is said that he took four hundred prisoners in that fort, and that he invested Fort-Washington on saturday, which occasioned the firing.—This is brought out by three of our officers who made their es∣cape from New-York on sunday, and is confirmed by a spy who
<PB N="12" REF="031423_0308_0FEC5C4590B9DC40"/>
went into Amboy, who says an express had arrived at Amboy from New-York, with an account of the loss of Fort-Inde∣pendence, and calling for a reinforcement to protect the city: in consequence of which, a number of troops had gone over.—I have sent in spies to Brunswic and Amboy to know the truth of this: and if it appears that they have weakened themselves to reinforce New-York, I shall probably make some attempt upon them, if we have men enough left to do it.</P>
<P>I shall be glad to know what stock of small-arms you at pre∣sent have, and what are your expectations shortly. The neces∣sity that we have been and are now under, of calling in and arming the militia scatters our armory all over the world in a manner: their officers are so irregular that they generally suf∣fer their men to carry home every thing that is put into their hands, which is forever lost to the public. The new-raised regiments will call for a great number of arms; and I do not at present see how they are to be supplied.</P>
<P>I would again beg leave to recall the attention of Congress to the appointment of general officers. I will not suppose the nomination of them is postponed upon a saving principle, be∣cause the advantage in having proper officers to examine the pay-rolls of their several regiments, and compare them with the returns of their brigades,—to see that the regiments are provided with what is proper, and that no more than a suffici∣ency is allowed,—to keep officers to their duty, and not, while the spirited officer is encountering all the fatigues and hardships of a rigorous campaign, suffer a number of others, under vari∣ous frivolous pretences and imaginary sicknesses, to enjoy them∣selves at the public expense at their own firesides:—I say, if the appointments are withheld upon parsimonious principles, the Congress are mistaken: for I am convinced, that, by the correction of many abuses which it is impossible for me to at∣tend to, the public will be benefited in a great degree in the article of expense.—But this is not all.—We have a very lit∣tle time to do a very great work in. The arranging, providing for, and disciplining a hundred and odd battalions is not to be accomplished in a day; nor is it to be done at all with any de∣gree of propriety, when we have once entered upon the active part of a campaign. These duties must be branched out, or they will be neglected, and the public injured. Besides, were the brigadiers appointed, they might be facilitating the recruit∣ing service; they would have time to get a little acquainted with their brigades, the wants of them, and case me of the great weight and burden which I at present feel.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="031423_0309_0FEC5BF7C220E818"/>
On whom the choice will or ought to light, I cannot under∣take to say. In a former letter I took the liberty of submit∣ting to the consideration of Congress the propriety of appoint∣ing, out of each state, brigadiers to command the troops of that state,—thinking, as a distinction is now fixed, a spirit of emula∣tion might arise by this means. At any rate I shall take the liberty of recommending general Cadwallader as one of the first for the new appointments. I have found him a man of a∣bility, a good disciplinarian, firm in his principles, and of intre∣pid bravery. I shall also beg leave to recommend colonel Reed to the command of the horse, as a person, in my opinion, every way qualified: for he is extremely active and enterpris∣ing: many signal proofs of which he has given this campaign. For the rest, the members of Congress can judge better than I can: I can only say, that, as the army will probably be divided in the course of the next campaign, there ought, in my opini∣on, to be three lieutenant-generals, nine major-generals, and twenty-seven brigadiers:—in other words, there ought, at least to be a brigadier to every four regiments, and a major-general to every three brigades.—The lieutenant-generals will, I pre∣sume, be appointed out of the oldest major-generals, and the major-generals from the oldest brigadiers. Nine brigadiers will then be to nominate.</P>
<P>I forgot before this to inform Congress, that, including the regiment of light dragoons from Virginia, and colonel Sheldon's to be raised in Connecticut, I have only commissioned officers for four regiments. I was willing to try how these could be e∣quipped before I put more officers into commission. It is ap∣prehended we shall find difficulty in providing necessaries or e∣ven horses for these four regiments: if we should not, I shall immediately set about the residue. Colonel Baylor, colonel Moylan (who, as volunteer has remained constantly with the ar∣my since his discontinuance in the quarter-master's department, and colonel Sheldon, command the three new regiments of light dragoons.</P>
<P>The treasury has been for some time empty, and the army has labored under the greatest inconvenience for the want of money. The recruiting service is particularly injured by this, as many officers are now waiting only for bounty-money. I have also complaints from the eastward of the want of money to car∣ry on their recruiting service.—If we are not supplied with that necessary article, all matters must be at a stand. I must there∣fore, beg that, if Mr. Palfrey has not been already supplied with a large sum, it may be done with the utmost expedition,
<PB N="14" REF="031423_0310_0FEC5BF0159B0568"/>
and that you will endeavor to keep up the supply by constantly sending on smaller parcels.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS last night honored with yours of the eighteenth instant, inclosing a letter from the state of New-York to Con∣gress. From the particular situation of their state in regard to their being totally deprived of commerce, they certainly must stand in need of the assistance of the other states to provide them with clothing and every thing necessary for the equipment of their forces; and it ever was my intention to allow them a full proportion of the clothing purchased to the eastward, whenever it came to hand. Little or none of it has reached this army, though in the greatest want, and exposed to the se∣verities of a winter campaign.</P>
<P>The convention have in one instance already provided for themselves out of the public stock by stopping and making use of twenty-six bales of clothing coming on from the eastward to the army here. As this was done without consulting me, I took the liberty of desiring them not to do the like in future; not that I meant to deprive them of their share, but because it disappointed me of many articles which I stood in immediate want of, and had not provided from other quarters. But you may be assured, that, whenever returns are to be made of the whole stock of clothing, they shall have their proportion, and more than that—allowance for their peculiar situation.</P>
<P>I am amazed to hear complaints of the hospital on the east side of Hudson's-river. Doctor Morgan, with most of his mates has been constantly there since I left it with the main body of the army. It is in vain however to look back upon past misfor∣tunes. I will not pretend to point out the causes; but I know matters have been strangely conducted in the medical line. I hope your new appointment, when it is made, will make the necessary reform in the hospital, and that I shall not, the next campaign, have my ears, and eyes too, shocked with the com∣plaints and looks of poor creatures perishing for want of proper care either in the regimental or hospital surgeons.</P>
<P>I agree with the convention in the expediency of obstructing
<PB N="15" REF="031423_0311_0FEC47EF28288C50"/>
the passage of the North-river in some, place between the mouth and the Highlands. We have found that our labor and expense has been thrown away in endeavoring to do it below, where the channel is amazingly wide and deep: but, from the slight view I have had of the river above, I think the passage may be easi∣ly obstructed, and defended by proper fortifications, as the ri∣ver is so narrow that no vessel going up could possibly escape the fire. I am no judge of what can be done towards fitting out the frigates at Poughkeepsie:—that must be left to the gentlemen of the marine committee.</P>
<P>The hint given by the convention of New-York, of the ne∣cessity and utility of a commissary of forage, had struck me be∣fore, and had been mentioned by general Mifflin, whose depart∣ment of quarter-master-general must be eased of part of the load which is at present thrown upon it. He is obliged in ma∣ny instances to act entirely out of his proper line; and instead of being confined to the duty of quarter-master-general, is also waggon-master, and forage-master-general,—I have wrote to two persons that I think qualified to fill the office of waggon-master; and I hope one of them will accept.—That of commis∣sary of forage shall be attended to.</P>
<P>The want of accurate maps of the country which has hither∣to been the scene of war has been of great disadvantage to me. I have in vain endeavored to procure them, and have been o∣bliged to make shift with such sketches as I could trace out from my own observation and that of gentlemen around me. I really think, if gentlemen of known character and probity could be employed in making maps (from actual survey) of the roads,—the rivers, and bridges and fords over them,—the mountains, and passes through them,—it would be of the greatest advan∣tage.</P>
<P>I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote to gene∣ral Howe, and proposed the fixing an agent for prisoners at New-York. I have not received an answer: but if he accedes to the proposal, I shall appoint Mr. Lewis Pintard.</P>
<P>I am sorry that I am obliged to contradict the report of the taking of Fort-Independence as mentioned in my last. I be∣lieve the evacuation of some detached redoubts gave rise to the report.—I have not heard from general Heath since the fourteenth instant, which I am amazed at. I am quite in the dark as to his numbers, and what progress he has made.</P>
<P>On the twenty-third, a party of four hundred of our men, under colonel * * *, fell in with two of the regiments of the enemy, convoying a number of waggons from Brunswic to Am∣boy.
<PB N="16" REF="031423_0312_0FEC47B15B27D7E0"/>
Our advanced party under colonel Parker engaged them with great bravery upwards of twenty minutes, during which time the colonel commandant was killed, and the second in com∣mand mortally wounded. The people living near the field of action say their killed and wounded were considerable. We lost only two men, who were made prisoners. Had colonel * * * come up with the main body, colonel Parker and the o∣ther officers think we should have put them to the rout, as their confusion was very great and their ground disadvantageous. I have ordered * * * under arrest, and shall bring him to trial to answer for so extraordinary a piece of conduct.</P>
<P>Reinforcements come up so extremely slow, that I am afraid I shall be left without any men before they arrive. The ene∣my must be ignorant of our numbers, or they have not horses to remove their artillery, or they would not suffer us to remain undisturbed. I have repeatedly wrote to all the recruiting of∣ficers, to forward on their men as fast as they could arm and clothe them: but they are so extremely averse to turning out of comfortable quarters, that I cannot get a man to come near me, though I hear from all parts that the recruiting service goes on with great success. It would be well if the board of war, in whose department it is, would issue orders for all officers to equip and forward their recruits to head-quarters with the greatest expedition.</P>
<P>By a resolve of Congress passed some time ago, general Schuyler is directed to apply to me for ninety-four tons of powder,—a quantity which it is impossible I should have by me, and for which I do not know where to direct him to apply. I could wish that returns were made to me of the quantity of powder on hand, and where it is to be found, that I may not be at a loss at any time of emergency.</P>
<P>Since the resignation of colonel Reed, the important office of adjutant-general has been left unfilled (I mean as to a princi∣pal), and I am much at a loss how or where to find a person in every way capable and proper to execute the office. My inclinations lead me to confer the appointment upon a major Morris: but ample testimonials should be produced, and full proof of fidelity ought to be made, before an office of so high trust should be conferred upon a person in a manner a stranger to me. I only know major Morris from a short personal ac∣quaintance, and from report: he never even brought a letter of recommendation to me. From his conversation and from the accounts I have received from others, he is a man of considera∣ble military abilities; and, from his behavior in two instan∣ces,
<PB N="17" REF="031423_0313_0FEC5C4E2FB5B308"/>
he is a man of bravery and conduct. His story is simply this,—that he left the British service in disgust, upon not receiv∣ing a promotion to which he was justly entitled. Perhaps some gentlemen of Congress may know more about him, or may be able to make such inquiries as might satisfy them as to the safe∣ty and propriety of appointing him. I have no other motive for wishing him a preference than that I think him the proper∣est person that has come under my notice, provided all mat∣ters before mentioned were cleared up.—I shall wait the re∣sult of a determination of Congress before I proceed further in this appointment; and I wish to be favored with their advice as speedily as possible; for the remains of the old army is much disarranged for want of a good adjutant-general, and the forma∣tion of the new in a great measure depends upon an able officer in that line.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE none of your favors un-answered at present.—There is such a demand upon me from all quarters for money, which I am unable to answer, that I cannot help again pressing you to send on a supply. The recruiting service is almost at a stop here for want of money; and governor Trumbull writes me word that it is totally so in Connecticut. He adds that their loan officers cannot proceed in their business for want of proper check-books and notes: but that, if they were furnished with them, they could soon take in a sufficient quantity to an∣swer their purposes.</P>
<P>I shall be glad to be informed whether I have a right to draw warrants upon the loan-officers in the different states.—The states of Connecticut advanced colonel Sheldon, at my re∣quest, ten thousand pounds lawful, to raise his regiment of horse. For their reimbursement they desired me to give them a draught upon the loan-office: but, not knowing whether I had a right to draw upon that fund, I deferred it till I heard from you.</P>
<P>I must beg you to write to the assemblies of the different states, and insist upon the passing a law to inflict a severe and heavy penalty upon those who harbor deserters, knowing them to be such. Our army is shamefully reduced by desertion; and, except the people in the country can be forced to give informa∣tion when deserters return to their old neighborhoods, we
<PB N="18" REF="031423_0314_0FEC5C5043E6BBC8"/>
shall be obliged to detach one half of the army to bring back the other.</P>
<P>I have a letter from general Heath, of the twenty-fourth in∣stant. He was at and near Kingsbridge with his army. I do not find that he is likely to do more than to draw the attention of the enemy that way, and to cut them off from forage, of which they are in great want.—The troops had not returned from Rhode-Island, by the last accounts, but were daily ex∣pected.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with yours of the twenty-fourth of Janua∣ry, with sundry resolves of Congress, and a petition of monsieur Pellisier's inclosed. I am not the proper [<HI>person</HI>] to refer the petition to, as I am no judge of his merit as an engineer, having never had an opportunity of seeing any of his performances. At any rate I do not see the necessity of appointing him or any other person principal engineer at Ticonderoga: for that would ex∣clude any other, though of superior abilities, from being sent there. Besides, as a corps of engineers will in all probability be soon established, monsieur Pellisier's rank can then be settled with more propriety.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention in any of my former letters that I had appointed captain Nathaniel Guest of Virginia to the command of a regiment to be raised upon the frontiers of Virginia and Carolina; and I have directed him, if possible, to bring a com∣pany or two of Cherokee Indians. If they can be procured, they will answer two valuable purposes,—one, as excellent scouts, the other that they will be in fact hostages, and will se∣cure the good behavior of their nation.</P>
<P>Major Bland, commandant of the Virginia horse, has desired to know whether there is not a necessity of giving a bounty and re-enlisting his regiment as continental troops. They were en∣listed to serve in the colony; and the men were with some dif∣ficulty prevailed upon to march hither: but the major thinks they would be entirely reconciled upon receiving the bounty.</P>
<P>I received a letter from Mr. Chase, desiring I would appoint proper persons to make inquiry into and take dispositions con∣cerning the behavior of the British and foreign troops in Jer∣sey. This would be an endless task, as their line of march is
<PB N="19" REF="031423_0315_0FEC5C5209385230"/>
marked with devastation, and is a thing of such public notorie∣ty that it demands no further proof.</P>
<P>I remonstrated with general Howe upon the treatment of our wounded at Princeton. You will see by the inclosed letter from him, that he disavows and detests the proceeding: but I fear that too much encouragement is given to such barbarous behavior by the British officers; for, in a late skirmish, in which sir William Erskine commanded, lieutenant Kelly of the fifth Virginia regiment was slightly wounded in the thigh; but, before he could get off the field, he was overtaken and murder∣ed in a most cruel manner. General Stephen informed me that he would write to sir William, and inform him, that, unless such practices were put a stop to, our soldiers would not be restrain∣ed from making retaliation.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heath, of the thirtieth of last month, I find that he had decamped from the neighborhood of Kings∣bridge, and removed back towards the White-Plains. His rea∣sons for doing so were that the troops could not stand the in∣clemency of the weather, and that he feared the troops expect∣ed from Rhode-Island would land upon his back. I have however directed him to leave a body of light troops under an active officer, in order to harrass their foraging parties, and to cover our own who are to remove as much of the forage from West-Chester county as they can: and, after leaving as many men as will secure the passes in the Highlands, the remainder are to be sent over here to join me; for I am apprehensive that the enemy are reinforcing themselves at Brunswic.</P>
<P>I shall to-morrow send out parties from every quarter, to re∣move all the waggons, horses, cattle and sheep, or as many as possible, from the neighborhood of the enemy's lines. They are to attend particularly to the horses: for if we can reduce those that they at present have, and can hinder them from get∣ting fresh ones from the adjacent country it will be impossible for them to move their artillery and waggons forward, should they incline to make another push towards Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I observe by your last resolves that the militia of Baltimore, Hartford, and Cecil counties in Maryland, are ordered out and to march this way. Let me entreat you to suffer none to go forward to Philadelphia but what are equipped with arms, accoutrements and blankets: they hurt the service much by taking those things only for a short time from the continental troops, many of whom would otherwise be enabled to take the field.</P>
<P>The secretary of the board of war has transmitted me ex∣tracts
<PB N="20" REF="031423_0316_0FEC5C5DF7AFC878"/>
of general Schuyler's letters in which he calls pressingly for some general officers to be sent to his assistance. This will shew you the necessity of immediately making the promotions recommended in mine of the twenty second of January: for at present I cannot spare a general officer from this quarter with∣out injuring the service.</P>
<P>Nothing of consequence has happened since I wrote to you last, except a skirmish on the first of this month, five or six miles from Brunswic-landing, between our advanced parties (about seven hundred in the whole) and upwards of two thou∣sand of the enemy, under sir William Erskine. The heat of the engagement was [<HI>borne by</HI>] colonel Scott of the first Vir∣ginia regiment, who, with about a hundred men, beat back two hundred of the British grenadiers. Several other officers be∣haved with great spirit; but there is some reason to suspect that colonel * * *, who commanded our main body, did not behave altogether as he ought. I have ordered a court upon him, that the matter may be fairly canvassed, and that he may stand condemned or acquitted by the evidence of those who were present.</P>
<P>Colonel * * *, who was under arrest upon a charge of cow∣ardice, broke his parole and went over to Bucks-county, I sup∣pose with an intent to make his escape: but I dispatched a troop of light-horse after him, who brought him back yester∣day: and he is to take his trial on friday.</P>
<P>The small-pox has made such head in every quarter, that I find it impossible to keep it from spreading through the whole army in the natural way. I have therefore determined, not only to inoculate all the troops now here that have not had it, but shall order Dr. Shippen to inoculate the recruits as fast as they come in to Philadelphia. They will lose no time, because they will go through the disorder while their clothing, arms and accoutrements are getting ready.</P>
<P>From the first institution of civil government, it has been the national policy of every precedent state to endeavor to engage its members to the discharge of their public duty by the obli∣gation of some oath: its force and happy influence has been felt in too many instances, to need any arguments to support the policy or prove its utility. I have often thought the states have been too negligent in this particular, and am more fully convinced of it from the effect general Howe's excurtion has produced in New-Jersey.—An oath is the only substitute that can be adopted to supply the defect of principle.—By our in∣attention in this article, we lose a considerable cement to our
<PB N="21" REF="031423_0317_0FEC5C0D8890A468"/>
own force, and give the enemy an opportunity to make the first tender to the oath of allegiance to the king. Its baneful in∣fluence is but too severely felt at this time. The people gene∣rally co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sess that they were compelled to take protection, and subscribe the <HI>Declaration:</HI> yet it furnishes many with argu∣ments to refuse taking any active part: and further they alledge themselves bound to a neutrality at least. Many conscientious people who were well-wishers to the cause, had they been bound to the states by an oath, would have suffered any punish∣ment rather than have taken the oath of allegiance to the king; and are now lost to our interest for want of this necessary tie.—Notwithstanding the obligation of the <HI>Association,</HI> they do not conceive it to have the same effect as an oath.—The more u∣nited the inhabitants appear, the greater difficulty general Howe will have in reconciling them to regal government, and consequently the less hope of conquering them.—For these rea∣sons and many more that might be urged, I should strongly re∣commend every state to fix upon some oath or affirmation of allegiance to be tendered to all the inhabitants without excep∣tion, and to outlaw those that refuse it.</P>

<P>I WAS yesterday waited upon by two French gentlemen, monsieur Romand de Lisle, and Robillard. The first produced a commission signed by you in November last, appointing him a major of artillery: but, by the inclosed letter from him to me, he claims much higher rank under the promise of Congress,—that of commandant of the continental artillery.—Whether any such promise was made, I leave you to determine.</P>
<P>Robillard claims a captaincy of artillery: but, upon what he grounds his pretentions, I do not know. I never saw him but once before; and that was upon his way from Boston to Phila∣delphia.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive what a weight these kind of people are upon the service, and upon me in particular. Few of them have any knowledge of the branches which they profess to un∣derstand; and those that have, are entirely useless as officers, from their ignorance of the English language.—I wish it were possible to make them understand, when commissions are grant∣ed to them, that they are to make themselves masters of the

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the fifth in∣stant, no event of an important and interesting nature has oc∣curred, unless the successes of our parties in foraging and bring∣ing off horses, waggons, and some fat cattle and sheep, which were contiguous to and around the enemy's lines, are consider∣ed as such. I then mentioned that I had such a scheme in con∣templation, which was happily accomplished the next day with∣out any loss. The enemy in turn have made frequent efforts in that way, but with little success. Whenever they made the attempt, it never failed to produce a skirmish. They have been common of late, but with little damage to either side.</P>
<P>We have certain intelligence that they have drawn the greatest part of their troops from Rhode-Island, and are told that part of them have landed on Staten-Island and at Am∣boy, with a view of augmenting their force at Brunswic.</P>
<P>Colonel * * *, agreeable to the information contained in my last, has been tried by a court-martial, and cashiered. The proceedings and sentence I directed to be transmitted to the secretary of the war-office, and to the printers of this state and Virginia, to be published.</P>
<P>General Lincoln is just arrived with a regiment of Massachu∣setts militia, about two hundred and fifty. This, he says, is succeeded by three more, which will make in the whole near eighteen hundred: but in this I think he must be mistaken, un∣less those on the march are much fuller and larger than what they usually are. The whole are of the troops that were with general Heath.</P>
<P>General Knox, by a letter of the first instant, informs me, that, on mature inquiry and examination, he finds Springfield to be more convenient and much better calculated for an ela∣boratory and cannon-foundery, than any other part of the New-England states. He adds that a quantity of copper, tin, and o∣ther useful materials, can be had there; and that the necessary works and preparations, from these and other advantages, can be accomplished at least three or four months sooner there than any where else. In consequence of his opinion, which I es∣teem of weight, particularly in this instance,—and knowing the

importance of, and how essential these establishments are,—I have ventured to order the works to be begun there, without regard to what had been done at Brookfield, which was of but little consequence. The former, besides the many advantages mentioned by general Knox, stands on Connecticut-river, and has a good navigation: yet is entirely secure against any at∣tempts of the enemy, being twenty miles above Hartford, where the river is narrow, and too shoal to admit vessels that can give the least annoyance.—As nothing but the good of the service could have led to this measure, I trust it will be ap∣proved.</P>
<P>I have wrote to the assembly of Massachusetts state and the convention of New-Hampshire, requesting their good offices and exertions to promote the raising of their regiments as ex∣peditiously as possible, and to forward the whole of the quotas first exacted from them, to Ticonderoga. Their contiguity to that post more than to any other,—the importance of it, and general Schuyler's apprehensions that the enemy may attempt to pass the lake (if not on the ice) as soon as it is open,—add∣ed to the great trouble, expense, and loss of time it will save in marching them elsewhere, and others there, who are much more distant and remote,—induced me to determine so. I find the council of the former, on general Schuyler's earnest appli∣cation, before my letter reached them, had determined to send four regiments as soon as they could be completed. I only wish the whole may be made up in a short time, and that their arrival may be early enough to prevent those inconveniences and fatal consequences which the want of a sufficient force in that quarter would subject us to, were the enemy to pass the lakes at this time.</P>
<P>Mr. James Mease is now here in consequence of being ap∣pointed clothier-general. He is adjusting a plan for answering the end of his appointment, and making an estimate, to be laid before Congress or their secret committee, of such clothes as may be necessary to import for the army.</P>
<P>It is with much concern that the situation of our affairs o∣bliges me to mention so frequently the want of money, especi∣ally when I am persuaded every means are used to furnish it. Our distress on this account is great indeed; and the injury the service receives, almost inconceivable:—not a day, an hour, or scarcely a minute passes, without complaints and applications on this head. The recruiting the regiments is most materially retarded by it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honor to inclose you a plan drawn up by doctor Shippen in concert with doctor Cochran, for the arrange∣ment and future regulation of the general hospital. As this plan is very extensive, the appointments numerous, and the salaries affixed to them at present, large, I did not think myself at liberty to adopt any part of it before I laid it before Con∣gress for their approbation. I will just remark, that, though the expense attending an hospital upon the inclosed plan will be very great, it will in the end not only be saving to the pub∣lic, but the only possible method of keeping an army a foot.</P>
<P>We are now, at an enormous bounty, and with no small diffi∣culty, recruiting an army of upwards of a hundred battalions. The ensuing campaign may, from the same causes, prove as sickly as the last: and if the hospitals are in no better condition for the reception of the sick, our regiments will be reduced to companies by the end of the campaign; and those poor wretch∣es who escape with life will be either scattered up and down the country, and not to be found, or if found, totally enervated and unfit for further duty. By these means not only the boun∣ty is lost, but the man is lost also: and I leave you to judge whether we have men enough to allow of such a consumption of lives and constitutions as have been lost the last compaign. For my own part I am certain, that, if the army which I hope we shall have in the field this year is suffered to moulder away by sickness as it did the last, we must look for reinforcements to some other places than our own states.</P>
<P>The number of officers mentioned in the inclosed plan I pre∣sume are necessary for us, because they are found so in the Bri∣tish hospitals: and, as they are established on the surest basis,—that of long experience under the ablest physicians and sur∣geons,—we should not hesitate a moment in adopting their re∣gulations, when they so plainly tend to correct and improve our former want of method and knowledge in this important depart∣ment.</P>
<P>The pay affixed to the different appointments is, as I said be∣fore, great, and perhaps more than you may think adequate to
<PB N="25" REF="031423_0321_0FEC5D45420B5C78"/>
the service. In determining upon the sum that is to be allow∣ed to each, you ought to consider that it should be such as will induce gentlemen of character and skill in their profession to step forth, and in some manner adequate to the practice which they have at home: for, unless such gentlemen are induced to take the care and management of our hospitals, we had better trust to the force of nature and constitution, than suffer persons entirely ignorant of medicine to destroy us by ill-directed appli∣cations.</P>
<P>I hear from every quarter that the dread of undergoing the same miseries for want of proper care and attention when sick, has much retarded the new enlistments, particularly to the south∣ward. This is another reason for establishing our hospitals up∣on a large and generous plan: for we ought to make the ser∣vice as agreeable and enticing as possible to the soldiery, many of whom (especially when we call forth the militia) not only quit the comforts but the luxuries of life.</P>
<P>A few days ago doctor * * * sent me the inclosed manuscript, which is a vindication of his conduct, upon which he desires a court of inquiry may be held. I transmit it to you by his di∣rection. As I do not know what particular charges were al∣ledged against him, I can say nothing to it or about it. You will find a plan of his also inclosed, for the better regulation of the hospital: but I think all his hints are included in doctor Shippen's plan.</P>
<P>As no time is to be lost in appointing the necessary officers, fixing upon the proper places for hospitals, and many other preparations. I could wish that Congress would take this mat∣ter under their immediate consideration, and favor me with their sentiments thereon as soon as possible.</P>

<P>THE principal design of this is to inform you that we have strong reasons to believe that the enemy are on the point of making some push. What their object is,—whether to beat up our quarters and to extend their own, to make a large fo∣rage and collection of provender of which they are in great want, or to turn their views towards the Delaware,—is a mat∣ter of uncertainty; but it seems probable that one of these things they have in contemplation. Such of their troops as have returned from Rhode-Island have landed at Amboy, and,
<PB N="26" REF="031423_0322_0FEC5C606DC6CFA0"/>
with them several pieces of heavy artillery General Howe is come over too, and, it is said lord Percy. Their number at Brunswic and the landing-place, before the arrival of this last reinforcement, was estimated from seven to eight thousand.</P>
<P>I have ordered the utmost vigilance and attention to be ob∣served at our several posts, to guard against surprises, and every preparation to be made that the weak and feeble state of our little army will admit of. At this time we are only about four thousand strong,—a force, you will suppose, unequal to a suc∣cessful opposition, if they were not militia, and far too small for the exigencies of our affairs. It is impossible to obtain exact returns, though they are daily called for,—owing to the fre∣quent and almost constant departure of some of the corps.</P>
<P>Colonel Neilson of Brunswic, with a detachment of militia, on the morning of the eighteenth, surprised major Stockdon, whom he took with fifty-nine privates of general Skinner's corps, killing four, and bringing away the arms of the whole, with some blankets. This about balances the loss of a militia guard which a party of British troops took last week in Mon∣mouth, near the Hook.</P>
<P>I wish to be informed how the regiments that are raising are to be armed, and of the provision that has been made for the same. I have reason to fear, indeed I am convinced, that there is a great deficiency in many, if not in the whole of the states, in this article: every letter that I receive from them mentions their want, and calls for supplies.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR Fanéuil, who some time ago laid a plan be∣fore you for raising and officering a corps of Frenchmen, waited upon me yesterday. His success, as I expected, has been small in enlisting or rather engaging Canadians. I cannot find that he has met with more than thirty or forty who would be willing to serve with him. He is now upon another scheme,—that of raising, arming, and clothing a number of men in the French islands.—To grant a commission of that kind is without the ex∣tent of my powers, and I have therefore desired him to go for∣ward, and lay his proposals before Congress. If they appear feasible they may be adopted: but I would beg leave to observe that one precaution will be necessary, that is, that the commissi∣ons of monsieur Eanéuil and his officers should depend upon the
<PB N="27" REF="031423_0323_0FEC5C181E166C50"/>
performance of their agreement for raising any certain number of men.</P>
<P>I have often mentioned to you the distress I am every now and then laid under by the application of French officers for com∣missions in our service. This evil, if I may call it so, is a grow∣ing one: for, from what I learn, they are coming in swarms from old France and the islands. There will therefore be a ne∣cessity of providing for them or discountenancing them. To do the first is difficult; and the last, disagreeable, and perhaps im∣politic if they are men of merit:—and it is impossible to distin∣guish these from mere adventurers, of whom. I am convinced, there are the greatest number. They seldom bring more than a commission and passport, which, we know, may belong to a bad as well as a good officer.</P>
<P>Their ignorance of our language, and their inability to re∣cruit men, are unsurmountable obstacles to their being ingraft∣ed into our continental battalions: for our officers, who have raised their men, and have served through the war upon pay that has hitherto not borne their expenses, would be disgusted if foreigners were put over their heads:—and I assure you, few or none of these gentlemen look lower than field-officers' com∣missions. To give them all brevets, by which they have rank and draw pay without doing any service, is saddling the conti∣nent with a vast expense: and to form them into corps, would be only establishing corps of officers; for, as I said before, they cannot possibly raise any men.</P>
<P>Some general mode of disposing of them must be adopted; for it is ungenerous to keep them in suspense, and at great charge to themselves: but I am at a loss how to point out this mode.—Suppose they were told in general, that no man could obtain a commission, except he could raise a number of men in proportion to his rank. This would effectually stop the mouths of common appliers, and would leave us at liberty to make pro∣vision for gentlemen of undoubted military character and merit, who would be very useful to us as soon as they acquired our language.</P>
<P>If you approve of this, or can think of any better method, be pleased to inform me as soon as you possibly can: for, if I had a decisive answer to give them, it would not only save me much trouble, but much time, which I am now obliged to be∣stow in hearing their different pretentions to merit, and their expectations thereupon.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CONGRESS having resolved that several regiments of cavalry should be raised to form a part of their army, I beg leave, through you, to lay before them the inclosed list of offi∣cers which appear necessary to be appointed to each corps, and which they will be pleased to establish. At the same time I should suppose it highly expedient to fix their pay and that of the privates. There is now one regiment in service, and three more recruiting: this makes it indispensably necessary that it should be done. Applications are constantly making, to know what the pay is, and objections raised against the service for want of due information.</P>
<P>I have transmitted a list of such pay as seemed to be thought reasonable for part of the officers to receive when colonel Shel∣don's regiment was directed to be levied, and a copy of the memorandum made at that time. This, colonel Sheldon con∣ceived, would not be more than adequate to their services, trouble, and expense, and which in some degree was founded on the opinions of other gentlemen of whom inquiry was made upon the subject. I did not fix it in the instances where it is set down with certainty, as the memorandum will shew. A cri∣terion, by which I was also governed upon that occasion, was the resolve appointing Mr. Sheldon lieutenant-colonel comman∣dant with the rank and pay of colonel. From thence I attempt∣ed to proportion that of some other officers.—Upon the whole I think it should be settled without further loss of time, and wish the earliest attention of Congress to be had to it.</P>
<P>Our delicate and truly critical situation, for want of a suffi∣cient force to oppose the enemy who are now ready, and, be∣fore many days elapse, will take the field, induced me to ex∣pect that the troops raising in the southern states, and intended for this army, would march in companies or half companies as they were made up, without waiting for their regiments to be complete. Policy strongly suggested the propriety of the mea∣sure, and I requested it: but, to my great anxiety and surprise, I am told that this line of conduct is totally neglected, though a great number of recruits are actually engaged. I must en∣treat Congress to interpose again with their most pressing appli∣cations,
<PB N="29" REF="031423_0325_0FEC5C66FAE83340"/>
and commands that this expedient may be adopted with∣out a moment's delay. No injury can result from it, because a sufficient number of proper officers can and must be left, to re∣cruit the corps to their full complement.</P>
<P>Nor will my fears respecting the state of our arms allow me to be silent on that head. Let the states be urged to send their men equipped with them, and every other necessary, if possible. I know not what supplies may be in store elsewhere, or in the power of Congress: but they must not depend upon their being furnished here with any, or but with very few:—no human prudence or precaution could secure but a small part of those belonging to the public, and in the hands of the soldiery, from being embezzled and carried off when their time of service ex∣pired; nor can the same abuses be restrained in the militia.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO military operation of any consequence has occurred since I had the honor of writing to you last, except that on sunday I received information that the enemy were advancing in a manner and in numbers so much greater than usual, that it looked like a prelude to an attack upon our posts, which were immediately put in the best preparation to receive them. It turned out to be only a stronger foraging party than usual. They were however opposed in so spirited a manner by our ad∣vanced parties, that they were checked, and retired in the af∣ternoon towards Amboy, from whence they came. Their loss in the course of the day from the best accounts I can get, a∣mounts to about one hundred in killed, wounded, prisoners, and deserters. Some people who were near the scene of action, and who have picked up accounts from those who have since been in Amboy, are sanguine enough to suppose that they lost five hundred altogether: but of this I have no conception.—Our loss was only two killed and ten wounded.</P>
<P>I was in hopes, that, by the time the militia who are now in service would be discharged, we should have a considerable number of the new levies in the field: but, though I have re∣ports from all quarters of the great success of recruiting, I cannot get a man of them into service. General Johnson's mi∣litia all go the fifth of March (many are gone already), and general Lincoln's on the fifteenth. These two bodies form so considerable a part of our force, that, unless they are replaced
<PB N="30" REF="031423_0326_0FEC5C6DECC85330"/>
I shall be left in a manner destitute: for I have no great hopes of seeing an equal number of continental troops by that time.</P>
<P>I have wrote to Pennsylvania, to endeavor to get a reinforce∣ment of militia from thence; and I am told the militia from the counties of Baltimore, Hartford, and Cecil, in Maryland, are on their march: but as I have it not from any authority, I know not when to expect them, or in what numbers. They are about passing a militia-law in this state, which may perhaps have some effect: but at present they are under no regulation at all.</P>
<P>I have in my late letters recommended several things to your consideration, particularly that of a promotion of general offi∣cers. The very well-being of the new army depends upon its being done speedily. Not only this, but we are now suffering for want of brigadiers. General Scuyler has wrote most press∣ingly for the assistance of general officers; and I have none to send him without injuring the service in this quarter.—The hos∣pital plan too requires an answer, as nothing can be done in the nomination of the proper officers till I have your determination. There are several other matters of consequence before you, to which I am waiting your answers before I can proceed upon the respective points to which they refer.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have a letter from the widow of a brave officer, who was killed at Princeton. If any provision is made, I do not recollect what it is: if there is any, please to inform me: if there is not, I can venture to recommend her as a proper ob∣ject, to make some reparation for her great loss.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this evening honored with your favor of the twenty-third ultimo, accompanied by sundry proceedings of Congress. Those respecting general Lee, and which prescribe
<PB N="31" REF="031423_0327_0FEC5C7504604CE0"/>
the treatment of lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the five Hes∣sian field-officers, are the cause of this letter.</P>
<P>Though I sincerely commiserate the misfortunes of general Lee, and feel much for his present unhappy situation, yet, with all possible deference to the opinion of Congress, I fear that these resolutions would not have the desired effect,—are found∣ed in impolicy,—and will, if adhered to, produce consequences of an extensive and melancholy nature, Retaliation is certain∣ly just, and sometimes necessary, even where attended with the severest penalties: but, when the evils which may and must re∣sult from it exceed those intended to be redressed, prudence and policy require that it should be avoided.—Having premised thus much, I beg leave to examine the justice and expediency of it in the instances now before us.</P>
<P>From the best information I have been able to obtain, gene∣ral Lee's usage has not been so disgraceful and dishonorable as to authorise the treatment decreed to those gentlemen, was it not prohibited by many other important considerations. His confinement, I believe, has been more rigorous than has been generally experienced by the rest of our officers, or those of the enemy who have been in our possession: but if the reports be true (received on that head), he has been provided with a de∣cent apartment and with most things necessary to render him comfortable. This is not the case with one of the officers com∣prehended in the resolves, if his letter, of which a copy is trans∣mitted, deserves your credit. Here retaliation seems to have been prematurely begun; or, to speak with more propriety, se∣verities have been and are exercised towards colonel Campbell, not justified by any that general Lee has yet received.</P>
<P>In point of policy, under the present situation of our affairs, this doctrine cannot be supported. The balance of prisoners is greatly against us; and a general regard to the happiness of the whole should mark our conduct. Can we imagine that our e∣nemies will not mete the same punishments, the same indigni∣ties, the same cruelties, to those belonging to us, in their pos∣session, that we impose on theirs in our power? Why should we suppose them to possess more humanity than we have our∣selves? or why should an ineffectual attempt to relieve the dis∣tresses of one brave unfortunate man involve many more in the same calamities?</P>
<P>However disagreeable the fact may be, the enemy at this time have in their power, and subject to their call, near three hundred officers belonging to the army of the United States. In this number, there are some of high rank; and most of them
<PB N="32" REF="031423_0328_0FEC47E991436348"/>
are men of bravery and merit. The quota of theirs in our hands bears no proportion, being not more than fifty at most. Under these circumstances, we should certainly do no act to draw upon the gentlemen belonging to us, and who have alrea∣dy suffered a long captivity, greater punishments than they have and now experience. If we should, what will their feelings be, and those of their numerous and extensive connexions?—Suppose the treatment prescribed for the Hessians should be pursued, will it not establish what the enemy have been aiming to effect by every artifice and the grossest misrepresentations,—I mean, an opinion of our enmity towards them, and the cruel conduct they experience when they fall into our hands,—a pre∣judice which we on our part have heretofore thought it politic to suppress and to root out by every act of lenity and of kind∣ness? It certainly will:—the Hessians would hear of the punish∣ment with all the circumstances of heightened exaggeration,—would feel the injury, without investigating the cause, or rea∣soning upon the justice or necessity of it. The mischiefs, which may and must inevitably flow from the execution of the re∣solves, appear to be endless and innumerable.</P>
<P>On my own part, I have been much embarrassed on the sub∣ject of exchanges already. Applications are daily made by both friends and enemies, to complete them as far as circum∣stances of number and rank will apply. Some of the former have complained that a discrimination is about to be adopted, perhaps injurious to their reputation, and certainly depriving them of their right of exchange in due course, as established upon the principles of equality proposed last year, acceded to by both parties, and now subsisting. The latter charge me with a breech of faith, and call upon me to perform the agree∣ment.</P>
<P>Many more objections might be subjoined, were they mate∣rial:—I shall only observe, that the present state of our army (if it deserves that name) will not authorise the language of re∣taliation or the style of menace. This will be conceded by all who know that the whole of our force is weak and trifling, and composed of militia (a very few regular troops excepted) whose service is on the eve of expiring.</P>
<P>There are several other matters which might be mentioned upon this subject, would time and opportunity permit: but, as they will not, I beg leave to refer you to colonel Walker, who will deliver this, and give satisfaction to any enquiries that may be deemed necessary. Persuading myself that Congress will in∣dulge the liberty I have taken upon this occasion, I have only
<PB N="33" REF="031423_0329_0FEC5C1C5BC83690"/>
to wish for the result of their deliberations after they have re∣considered the resolves, and to assure them that—I have the honor to be. &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I do myself the honor to transmit you the inclosed copy of a letter from general Lee, received by a flag on Tuesday last. You will perceive from thence his wishes and expectations of seeing some members of Congress in consequence of his letter upon that subject. None of the passports which he mentions were sent out, though the letter came by general Howe's per∣mission as the others did. I should be happy to relieve his anxiety as far as I could, by sending in major Morris: but this I cannot do till a safe conduct is granted.</P>
<P>The more I consider the resolves respecting lieutenant colo∣nel Campbell and the Hessian officers, the more convinced I am of their impolicy. The proposition made by Congress for the exchange of prisoners, and which by their direction was trans∣mitted to general Howe, was founded on principles of equality in number and in rank. From hence no demand, as a matter of right, can be made of general Lee's releasement for any officer or number of officers of inferior rank: whatever is or might be done in such instance, would be of favor and indulgence. The only cartel that now subsists is the one I have mentioned. This, so far as it goes, is a beneficial one: it recognises the rank of our officers, and insures their discharge from captivity whenever we are possessed of a like number belonging to them, and of the same rank. If on our part it should be violated,—if it is not observed,—surely it will and must cease to be obligatory on ge∣neral Howe. What consequences may then ensue, I leave to your conjecture.</P>
<P>If it be objected that the above observations, and what I said in my former letter, prove that no treatment received by our officers should be retaliated on theirs,—my answer is, that the proportion of officers in their hands is at least six to one in ours. This consideration, supposing we had a right to de∣mand general Lee's liberty, would be of great weight, and suf∣ficient to prevent, in my opinion, the execution of the resolves.—I have the honor to be, in haste, your most obedient ser∣vant.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored several days ago with your letter of the twenty-fifth ultimo, with its inclosures, the receipt of which was omitted to be acknowledged in my last.</P>
<P>Could I accomplish the important objects so eagerly wished by Congress,—"confining the enemy within their present quar∣ters,—preventing their getting supplies from the country, and totally subduing them before they are reinforced,"—I should be happy indeed. But what prospect or hope can there be of my effecting so desirable a work at this time? The inclosed return, to which I solicit the most serious attention of Congress, comprehends the whole force I have in Jersey. It is but a handful, and bears no proportion, on the scale of numbers, to that of the enemy. Added to this, the major part is made up of militia. The most sanguine in speculation cannot deem it more than adequate to the least valuable purposes of war.</P>
<P>The reinforcements mentioned to be drawn from general Heath were merely ideal,—nearly the whole of the eastern troops which were with him being here before. They were only engaged till to-day: and to-day they leave the camp. Their service has been of pretty long continuance, and almost the whole of the winter months. What prospect there may be of immediate succours from other quarters, I know not: but from the militia of this state I cannot expect to derive much more aid. Those who are well effected have been so frequently cal∣led from their home, that they are tired out, and almost profess an abhorrence of the service: nor have I heard as yet that any continental troops are on the way. I have wrote to the briga∣diers-general in most of the states upon the subject, and also to the colonels, urging them by every motive to exert themselves in filling the regiments and to forward them on.</P>
<P>I confess, sir, I feel the most painful anxiety when I reflect on our situation and that of the enemy. Unless the levies ar∣rive soon, we must, before it be long, experience some interest∣ing and melancholy event. I believe the enemy have fixed their object, and the execution will surely be attempted as soon as the roads are passable. The unprepared state in which we are, favors all their designs; and it is much to be wished that they may not succeed to their warmest expectations.</P>
<P>On recurring to the late promotions of brigadiers, I find the number appointed to be short of what I took the liberty to re∣commend, and not competent to the exigencies of the service supposing the whole in office before, and those lately created,
<PB N="35" REF="031423_0331_0FEC5C7B88257AD0"/>
onsent to act, which I have reason to believe will not be the case. I shall only beg leave to refer you to my former letters upon this subject, and to assure you that many disadvantages will result from not having a sufficient number of officers of this rank. We have always been deficient in this instance; and certain I am that the service is greatly injured by it. The proportion I mentioned was full small, and, in my opinion, should not be dispensed with.</P>
<P>I would also take the liberty of mentioning again (having received no answer upon the subject) that settling the hospital plan and establishment becomes more and more necessary. It is an object of infinite importance; and the difficulties of doing it on a proper foundation will be great, if not almost insur∣mountable, should it be deferred till the campaign opens, and the enemy begin their operations. The benefits of the institu∣tion will soon be known:—the want was severely felt in the course of the last year.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which claims, in my opinion, the earliest attention of Congress,—I mean the pay of the regimen∣tal surgeons, and that of the mates. These appointments are so essential, that they cannot be done without. The pay, in the first instance, is so low, so inadequate to the services which should be performed, that no man sustaining the character of a gentlemen, and who has the least medical abilities or skill in the profession, can think of accepting it: that in the latter is so paltry and trifling, that none, of the least generosity of senti∣ment or pretentions to merit, can consent to act for it. In a word, these are inconveniencies of an interesting nature:—they amount to an exclusion of persons who could discharge the du∣ties of those offices; and, if not redressed, there is not the smallest probability that any can be prevailed on to enter them again.</P>
<P>There are several matters also which I refered to Congress some time since, and upon which I have not received the result of their diliberations.—one enquiry, about the state of arms and ammunition, I am peculiarly anxious to be satisfied in.</P>
<P>From the inconveniences and injuries to the service of late for want of money, I am induced to request that the strictest regard should be had to furnishing the paymaster with constant and sufficient supplies. On sunday he received five hundred thousand dollars, half of which is already expended, and the balance in a day or two will be entirely swept away, without discharging the several claims. By his report, the commissary here requires an immediate draught for a hundred thousand;
<PB N="36" REF="031423_0332_0FEC5C7DA3EF18C0"/>
and the militia returning and about to leave camp, a hundred and twenty thousand—more. The expense incurred by calling on them so frequently is almost incredible. Besides these, there are several arrears due to the old troops, and to most of the general and staff officers.</P>

<P>I fully intended to transmit you a general return, but am not able to make it out with precision. However, from the most accurate estimate that I can form, the whole of our numbers in Jersey, fit for duty at this time, is under three thousand. These (nine hundred and eighty-one excepted) are militia, and stand engaged only till the last of this month. The troops under inoculation, including their attendants, amount to about one thousand.</P>

<P>THE difficulty if not impossibility of giving Congress a just idea of our situation (and of several other important matters requiring their earliest attention) by letter, has induced me to prevail on major-general Greene to wait upon them for that purpose. This gentleman is so much in my confidence, so inti∣mately acquainted with my ideas,—with our strength and our weaknesses,—with every thing respecting the army,—that I have thought it necessary to particularise or prescribe any certain line of duty or inquiries for him. I shall only say, from the rank he holds as an able and good officer in the estimation of all who knew him, he deserves the greatest respect; and much regard is due to his opinions in the line of his profession. He has upon his mind such matters as appear to me most material to be immedi∣ately considered of; and many more will probably arise during the intercourse you may think proper to honor him with;—on all which I wish to have the sense of Congress, and the relult of such a deliberation as may be formed thereupon.</P>
<P>I have enclosed an extract of a letter received yesterday from governor Trumbull, with a copy of one intercepted, going from the late governor Wentworth to his sister. The information contained in the letter, if true, is important and interesting: how far it is to be relied on, I cannot determine: but there can be no doubt of the British court's straining every nerve and interest at home and abroad, to bend us to their * * * yoke.</P>

<P>COLONEL Palfrey, having expressed a desire to settle the accounts of his office to this time, has obtained my per∣mission to repair to Philadelphia, and now waits on Congress with his books and vouchers, hoping that a committee will be appointed to examine and adjust the same.</P>
<P>The disadvantages which have arisen to the service, and which have been severely felt, for want of constant supplies in the military chest, are almost incredible, and are not to be de∣scribed but with great difficulty to those who are not imme∣diately in the army, and privy to the frequent and importunate applications that are made. To prevent inconveniencies of the like nature in future, I have thought it proper that an estimate of the monthly advances should be formed and laid before Con∣gress. This colonel Palfrey will do; and, though it cannot be effected with a degree of scrupulous exactness and precision, yet from his intimate knowledge of the incidental charges and expenses in the common course of things, the calculation, I apprehend, will be attended with many benefits. It will shew Congress the necessary provisions of money to be made for ordi∣nary contingencies, and enable them to form a rule for their government in the instance of supplies for the army.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY a letter, of which the inclosed is a copy, came to my hands. The account is confirmed by a countryman who is since come in: but nothing distinct has yet been re∣ceived.</P>
<P><PB REF="031423_0334_0FEC5C8464AFA5B8"/>
The aid required of me in colonel Hay's letter cannot be given: I have no men to oppose the ennemy's designs in any one quarter, although called upon from every quarter. All that was possible for me to do towards collecting a force at Peekskill, I had attempted before:—I had in peremptory terms called upon the officers of Rhode-Island and Connecticut to forward on their recruits under proper officers as fast as possi∣ble to that place: I had directed such of the New-York regi∣ments as had been ordered to Ticonderoga, to repair thither: I had requested eight of the Massachusetts regiments to be march∣ed to that post: and, lest these should not arrive in time, I urg∣ed governor Trumbull, in a letter of the sixth instant, to send two thousand of his militia to the same place. But sorry I am to observe, the militia have got tired; and the colonels of the continental regiments have been greatly deceived themselves,—have greatly deceived me,—or the most unheard-of desertions * * * have prevailed * * *: for regiments, reported two or three months ago to be half completed, are, upon the colonels being called upon in positive terms for a just state of them, found to contain less than one hundred men; and this not the case of a single regiment only, but of many. In Connecticut alone, by a letter from general Parsons, of the sixth instant, four regiments are mentioned as not having more than eighty rank and file, each.</P>
<P>These, sir, are melancholy truths: but facts they are, and ne∣cessary to be known to Congress, however prudent it may be to conceal them from the observation of others.</P>
<P>To superintend the business of recruiting,—to see that the officers were diligent,—to prevent impositions if possible,—to appoint fit places of rendezvous,—to see that the recruits were actually brought to those places, and there equipped and train∣ed for the field,—were among the great objects which early and repeatedly induced me to press the appointment of general officers: but unfortunately the delay of appointing, being fol∣lowed by the resignation of some officers and non-acceptance of others, will involve the army in a mere chaos of confusion at a time when the utmost order and regularity should prevail, and when all our arrangements ought to be completely established. The medical department will, it is much to be seared, be in the same situation:—not an officer yet appointed to it.</P>
<P>For want of proper and coercive powers,—from disaffection and other causes,—the militia of this state are not to be depend∣ed upon. They are drawn out with difficulty, and at a most enormous expense, as their accounts will shew: they come, you
<PB REF="031423_0335_0FEC5C86532AE028"/>
can scarce tell how; they go, you hardly know when. In the same predicament are those of Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>Numbers from this state have joined the enemy; and many more are disposed to do so, as the letter from Mr. Hoff (a copy of which is inclosed, corresponding with several others of the same tenor) sufficiently evinces.</P>

<P>I LAST night had the honor to receive your leter of the twenty-sixth instant, accompanied by sundry resolves of Con∣gress, and some other papers.</P>
<P>The arrival of the arms, locks, and flints, you have been pleased to mention, is a most fortunate and happy event. I join you most sincerely in congratulations upon the occasion.</P>
<P>I have not yet obtained a certain account of the expedition against and destruction or Peekskill. Information of those e∣vents has not been yet transmitted by generals M'Dougal or Clinton, or the convention of the state. There is no doubt but that the town is destroyed, and, with it, some stores:—neither the quality nor amount of them is known. It is said that it was done in part by our own people when they found that they could not prevent them falling into the enemy's hands.—The ships and troops have gone down the river again.</P>
<P>Mr. Kirkland, the Oneida missionary, arrived here this week with a chief warrior and five other Indians of that nation. They had been to Boston, and came from thence to this place to inquire into the true state of matters, that they might report them to a grand council to be shortly held. They said things were so falsely and variously represented by our enemies through their agents, that they did not know what to depend on. I in∣vited them to go to Philadelphia: but they declined it, decla∣ring they were well satisfied with what they had seen, and that
<PB N="40" REF="031423_0336_0FEC5C90DC0DAFB8"/>
they were authorised to tell their nation, all they had heard from the enemy was false. Being told that France was assisting us, and about to join in the war, they seemed highly pleased; and Mr. Kirkland said he was persuaded it would have a consi∣derable effect on the minds of several of the nations, and secure to us their neutrality, if not a declaration and commencement of hostilities in our favor. I shewed them every civility in my power, and every thing that I thought material to excite in them an idea of our strength and independence. After staying two days, they set off for their nation expressing their desire of the most speedy return to the council, and professing the most friendly sentiments towards us.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN Deshields, of Mr. Buchanan's ship from Bal∣temore, who was taken by the enemy and carried into York, made his escape from thence on saturday evening. He informs that three thousand troops British and Hessian, embarked about ten days ago from the city and Staten-Island, on board trans∣ports which were lying at the latter when he came away. He adds that the enemy have built and are building a number of light flat bottomed boats, about seventy of which are finished.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="031423_0337_0FEC5C9303B737B8"/>
Captain Deshields says it seemed to be the general opinion and conversation that this embarkation was for Chesapeak-bay, with a view of making a descent on the Eastern-Shore, or that the troops were to proceed to the Head of Elk, taking Anna∣polis and Baltimore in their way. There were some who thought it probable they mean to go up the North-river and attempt the Highland fortifications.—I have written to generals M'Dougal and Clinton, desiring them to make the best preparation that circumstances will admit of, for their reception, in case the latter should be their object.</P>
<P>Captain Deshields being in company with the captain of the packet, but unknown to him, heard him say that a war with France was much expected when he left England, which was about the beginning of February.</P>

<P>I AM honored with yours of the fourth, inclosing sun∣dry resolves of Congress from the twenty-ninth of March to the fifth instant.—I am extremely glad to see the resolve for the immediate removal of military stores from Baltimore and Annapolis; for, although I do not imagine that the enemy in∣tend an expedition of any great consequence in Chesapeak-bay yet while the stores lay at the above-mentioned places, they were always subject to be destroyed by a sudden attack of a ship of war with a few land forces.</P>
<P>The regulations for the paymaster-general's department are very salutary, and, if carried strictly into execution, will make a vast saving to the public. It may be easily done when the army is put upon a regular footing: but, while we are obliged to make use of militia, we must submit to all the irregularities that naturally attend them, and must not therefore expect to have the rule as scrupulously complied with by them as could be wished. * * *</P>
<P>The muster-master-general complained that the duty required of him was more than he could perform: but by the late re∣solves there is an ample allowance for deputies; and therefore no further excuse can be made upon that head.</P>
<P>I most ardently wish to see the hospital established. I am afraid too much time has been lost in the consideration of the plan: but the gentlemen who shall be appointed to the superin∣tendence must endeavor to make up for lost time by their dili∣gence.</P>
<P>By the latest accounts from Brunswic, it looks as if the enemy were projecting an embarkation. They have been strip∣ping the buildings of boards, and cutting small timber, and transporting them from Brunswic to Amboy. It is imagined this is to build births in their transports.—I shall keep a con∣stant look-out upon the motions of the vessels, and shall en∣deavor to obtain every intelligence by sending people into their quarters.—I think Delaware-bay must be their destination if they move by water.</P>

<P>I WAS just now honored with your letter of the ninth instant, covering sundry resolutions of Congress. Those for regulating the hospital and medical department, I trust, will prove of the most salutary consequences. It is only to be re∣gretted that this necessary and liberal institution had not been gone into and completed at an earlier period.</P>
<P>The honors Congress have decreed to the memory of gene∣rals Warren and Mercer, afford me the highest pleasure: their character and merit had a just claim to every mark on respect; and I heartily wish that every officer of the United States, emulating their virtues, may by their actions secure to them∣selves the same right to the grateful tributes of their country.</P>
<P>Since writing to you yesterday I have received further in∣telligence of the enemy's preparations in York, indicating a movement before long. It is contained in the inclosed letter, No. 1, and corroborates the opinion I have long entertained that they would make a push against Philadelphia. The tory regiments mentioned, we are told, are at Hackinsac, and are about five hundred strong, exclusive of a company of High∣landers which is with them.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter from le chevalier count De Vrecourt came to hand this morning,—which I have thought proper to transmit to Congress, that they may consider his case, and adopt such measures respecting him as his character and testi∣monials deserve. I never heard of him before: but if he is a skilful engineer, he will be extremely useful, and should be employed, though he may not understand our language. At this time we have not one with the army, nor one to join it, of the least reputation or pretensions to skill. If this gentle∣man came in consequence of an agreement with doctor Frank∣lin, and brought credentials from him, I should suppose him to be acquainted with what he was recommended for.</P>
<P>The cartel, proposed to be settled, and so long in agitation, is not accomplished yet: the last meeting on that business was the second instant, when nothing was done; nor is a further interview appointed respecting it. I have transmitted a copy of lord Cornwallis's letter which came out the next day, with that of the paper alluded to by him, which Mr. Harrison re∣fused to receive from colonel Walcot, and of my answer to the latter in a letter to general Howe. The objections or ar∣ticles mentioned by colonel Walcot were those general Greene had with him, and which he left when he came from Philadel∣phia:

the original I have by me. Those points were insisted on again, and rejected, and a tender made of the paper by co∣lonel Walcot, which he brought with him prepared.</P>
<P>I have appointed John Wilkins, John Steel, Mathew Ir∣vin, and Samuel Kersley, esquires, captains of companies to be raised by them, in consequence of the recommendation of general Armstrong. As the interest of those gentlemen lies in Pennsylvania chiefly, and it would be drawing money from the paymaster here to carry to Philadelphia (supposing there was a supply in the chest, which is not the case), I shall be obliged by Congress's ordering six hundred dollars to be ad∣vanced to each of them on account of the recruiting service; the first of whom I imagine is in Philadelphia. If this requi∣sition can be complied with, he, I presume, will give notice to the rest; or, if general Armstrong is informed of it, he will do it.</P>

<P>I AM honored with yours of the tenth, accompanied with one from the committee of Congress to whom I have wrote very fully upon the subject of the resolve for forming an army upon the west side of Delaware, and to which I refer you.—I wish I could see any prospect of an army, fit to make pro∣per opposition, formed any where. You will perhaps be sur∣prised at this after the public reports of the great success of recruiting in all the states; but, to convince you that these are but bare reports, I will give you the best information I have been able to collect from actual returns and other accounts.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="031423_0341_0FEC5C9B05874498"/>
New-Hampshire.—No returns: but a letter from general Heath says they are tolerably forward.—All their regiments go to the northward.</P>
<P>Massachusetts.—About four hundred men raised to a regi∣ment; many of these yet to undergo inoculation. Seven of their regiments go to the northward, and eight are to come to Peekskill for the present.</P>
<P>Rhode-Island.—Only three hundred and sixty men enlisted in both regiments the first of April. Two hundred of these are yet to be inocualted.—General Varnum writes me that he des∣pairs of filling up the regiments.</P>
<P>Connecticut.—By a return from general Parsons, of the fourth of April, about eighteen hundred men were recruited through the whole state,—they, much dispersed;—many to have the small-pox; and recruiting at a stand.</P>
<P>New-York.—About two hundred men to a regiment: and, from the peculiar situation of that province, it will be almost impossible for them to fill up their regiments though they exert themselves very much.</P>
<P>New-Jersew.—Between two and three hundred to a regi∣ment. They also lie under many difficulties on account of the disaffection of their state: but their officers are active and dili∣gent.</P>
<P>Pennsylvania.—Most of her regiments are very backward,—those most so, who have been longest recruiting.</P>
<P>Delaware state.—No return of their regiment.</P>
<P>Maryland.—I have only the return of one regiment, which consists of two hundred men: but I do not believe the others are in more forwardness. The disputes about the rank of offi∣cers have prevailed so much, that the recruiting service has been in a manner neglected.</P>
<P>Virginia.—The nine old regiments will not exceed eighteen hundred effective men: and governor Henry, in a letter which I received yesterday, informs me that he did not think that more than four of the six new ones would be filled. He pro∣poses the expediency of raising volunteer companies to serve se∣ven or eight months, to make up the deficiency: but this I shall object to on many accounts, particularly that it would be introducing a body of men who would look upon themselves at liberty to do what they pleased, and, the moment their time expired would leave us, though at the most critical juncture.</P>
<P>If the men that are raised, few as they are, could be got into the field, it would be a matter of some consolation: but eve∣ry method that I have been able to devise has proved ineffec∣tual.
<PB N="46" REF="031423_0342_0FEC5C9F87854718"/>
If I send an officer to collect the sick and scattered of his regiment, it is ten to one but he neglects his duty, goes home on pleasure or business, and the next that I hear of him is that he has resigned:—furloughs are not more attended to than if there was no limitation of time:—and in short, sir, there is such a total depression of that military ardor which I hoped would have inspired every officer when he found his pay genteelly augmented and the army put upon a respectable footing, that it seems to me as if all public spirit was sunk * * *</P>
<P>I shall as soon as possible transmit to the board of war a list of the appointments I have made in consequence of the powers vested in me.</P>
<P>If the appointments in the hospital are not filled up before the receipt of this, I would take the liberty of mentioning a gentleman whom I think highly deserving of notice, not only on account of his abilities, but for the very great assistance which he has afforded in the course of this winter, merely in the nature of a volunteer. The gentlemen is doctor John Co∣chran, well known to all the faculty, and particularly to doc∣tor Shippen, who, I suppose, has mentioned him among the can∣didates. The place for which the doctor is well fitted, and which will be most agreeable to him, is surgeon general to the middle department. In this line he served all the last war in the British service, and has distinguished himself this winter, particularly in his attention to the small-pox patients and the wounded, who, but for him and doctor Bond, must have suffer∣ed much, if not been totally neglected, as there were no other medical gentlemen to be found.—If the appointment of surgeon-general is filled up, that of deputy-director of the middle de∣partment would be acceptable.</P>
<P>I have been thus full in my recommendation because doctor Cochran in my manner had my promise of one of the capital appointments in the hospital, upon a presumption that I should have had some hand in the nomination by the resolution of Congress empowering me to fill all commissions under the rank of brigadiers-general.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 13.—I have this moment received a line from general Lincoln, informing me that the enemy attempted to surprise him early this morning at his post at Boundbrook; but he made good his retreat to the pass of the mountains just in his rear, with trifling loss.</P>

An enterprise of a similar nature was for∣med against that at Amboy, in which the party sent to effect it did not succeed so well, though the most advanced of them seized and secured three of their out-centuries without giving an alarm.</P>
<P>By a letter from general M'Dougal, of yesterday, I am in∣formed that he had received accounts of thirty-six sail of trans∣ports having left Newport on friday last, with troops on board. Other reports he had were that a number of ships were coming up the sound, so that we may reasonably conclude general Howe is drawing his forces from the eastward. General Arnold, in a letter of the sixth, mentioned, that, from the preparation of transports, and other circumstances, he thought it probable an embarkation was about to take place.</P>
<P>There are grounds to suspect from information received, that some unfair practices have been and are meant to be used in certain exports from Philadelphia. It is said that a vessel navi∣gated by Frenchmen loaded there, belong to * * * of New∣York, which carried her cargo to general Howe; also that * * * and * * * of Monmouth-county intend to load one or more for the same purpose, under the idea of sending them to foreign markets. I have written to the board of war for Penn∣sylvania upon the subject, and doubt not but these hints will be
<PB N="48" REF="031423_0344_0FEC5CB1B3944CC8"/>
properly improved, and such frauds guarded against as well as circumstances will admit.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a copy of an advertisement published in Gaine's paper of the fourteenth, which shews that no artifices are left untried by the enemy to injure us. Before the appear∣ance of this unparralleled piece, I had heard that a person was gone from York to Rhode-Island with a quantity of counterfeit money.</P>
<P>There is one thing which I beg leave to mention to Con∣gress, and which I think highly deserving their attention, that is, that supplies of hard money, or bills of exchange to procure it, should, if possible be sent our prisoners in the hands of the enemy, at least to the officers, to relieve their wants. By let∣ters which I have received from them of late, I find they are in great distress, and such as ought to be removed, if it can be done.—No inconvenience will result to the public from such supplies, if they can be furnished, as proper stoppages and de∣ductions can be made from their pay.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 19.—I was honored with your letter of the sixteenth between twelve and one o'clock yesterday, accompanied by sundry resolutions. I hope the measures Congress have adopted will produce the salutary consequences they had in view: but I fear that the states, unless they are delicate in exercising the powers they are invested with for filling vacancies in instances of removal from office, and pay strict attention to a proper line of succession where there are no capital objections, will renew much of that confusion and disorder we have been endeavoring to extricate ourselves from. Nor will this be of small difficulty if they displace many officers: for, supposing them to have kept the most accurate lists of their original appointments, changes have taken place in several instances from various causes un∣known to them, and of which they cannot be apprised.</P>
<P>I can assure Congress the appellation given to the regiments officered by me was without my consent or privity. As soon as I heard it, I wrote to several of the officers in terms of se∣vere reprehension, and expressly charged them to suppress the distinction, adding that all the battalions were on the same foot∣ing, and all under the general name of Continental.</P>
<P>An attack upon the king's troops of Rhode-Island was cer∣tainly a desirable event, could it have been conducted with suc∣cess, or upon equal terms. It being an object of great moment, and involving in its issue many important consequences, I am led to believe the practicability of it has had much considera∣tion, and the measure was found to be unadvisable under the
<PB N="49" REF="031423_0345_0FEC5CB39943D5A0"/>
circumstances of the troops collected for the purpose. If the enemy have not evacuated the Island, I suppose the matter will be further weighed.</P>
<P>I do not find in the medical arrangement any mention of re∣gimental surgeons'-mates, or provision made for their payment. Whether Congress mean to dispense with such officers or not, I cannot tell: I have heard that they do: but they appear to me to be absolutely necessary. We are often obliged to divide re∣giments and send a part to a distant post: when this is the case, it is essential that there should be some person with them to take charge of the sick or wounded, if such there should be.—I have only mentioned this of many reasons that might be urged to shew the expediency of such appointments.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the many circumstances inducing a belief that Philadelphia will be the first object of the enemy's atten∣tion,—yet, as the stratagems of war are various, and they may be easily changed, especially when they have the entire com∣mand of the water,—I cannot but consider the detention of the troops at Philadelphia, farther than mentioned in my letter in answer to that from the board of war, as expedient, and subject to great inconvenience and injury. In the present divided, se∣parted state of the army, we are weak at all points, and not able to make the least opposition promising success, Supposing they were collected here, they would be ready to act as necessity and circumstances might require. If the enemy pushed for Phila∣delphia, we should have notice of it, and could hang upon their flank and rear: nor is it likely they would undertake such an expedition without attempting the destruction or dispersion of the army first. If they embarked and should go to sea, we should have information of it, and could be there in time. On the other hand, should all they have done prove a feint, and they should turn their views to the North-river, we should be in a much better situation to counteract their designs, and to check the progress of their arms in that quarter. Added to this, several of the rigiments, especially those which came first from Virginia and Pennsylvania, are so broken that it is impossi∣ble to do any thing with the parts that are here; and that spi∣rit which is always derived from a corps being full, or as much so as circumstances of number will admit of, is entirely done away.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honored with your favor of the twen∣tieth, inclosing sundry proceedings of Congress.—The removal of provisions, &amp;c. from the communication between Brunswic and Trenton has been pretty well effected already. It was an object early attended to, and what I recommended to the as∣sembly of this state as deserving their interposition and aid: but finding that it had not their immediate consideration, and that they seemed to decline interfering in the matter, I directed the quarter-master and commissaries to purchase their first supplies of those necessaries from such places as appeared to be most ex∣posed to the enemy's incursions and through which it is most probable they will take their route towards the Delaware, in case an enterprise that way should be in contemplation. I have transmitted copies of the resolve upon this subject to general Put∣nam and colonel Forman (the latter of whom is in Monmouth∣county), with orders to execute the same agreeable to the di∣rections therein prescribed, where it may be necessary on the road leading from South-Amboy across the country.</P>
<P>I have nothing of importance to communicate to Congress. The advices they will receive to-day, which passed through this town yesterday, will tell them that the enemy remained at Rhode-Island on the fifteenth instant, notwithstanding the ac∣counts we had received of their embarkation before.</P>

<P>I WAS last night honored with your letter of the twenty∣fifth, with sundry resolves of Congress. Such of them as are necessary for my government and conduct I shall strictly attend to.</P>
<P>The money and bill for our prisoners had better be transmit∣ted to Elias Boudinot, esquire, to whom I shall give directions to adopt ways and means for sending the same, and for a proper appropriation and distribution of the money amongst them. Bills, I think will be most eligible, provided they are duly paid. As to procuring clothes in New-York, I have reason to believe that it will not be allowed, and that the prisoners will obtain no supplies but what we send them.</P>
<P>I heard of Mr. Franklin's practices some time ago, and ad∣vised governor Trumbull of the same, that his conduct might be properly attended to. It is very unhappy for us, that, through the intrigues of such men, the enemy have found means to raise a spirit of disaffection but too generally in many of the states. In this, I have strong assurances that it has arisen to a great heigth; and I shall not be disappointed if a large number of the inhabitants in some of the counties should openly appear in arms as soon as the enemy begin their operations. I have taken every measure in my power to suppress it; but neverthe∣less several from Sussex and Bergan have joined their army, and the spirit becomes more and more daring every day.</P>
<P>You will be pleased to direct general Misslin to remain in Philadelphia as long as Congress shall think his presence there essential.</P>
<P>I have inlcosed a copy of general Howe's letter which I re∣ceived last night in answer to mine of the ninth instant.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night received the favor of your letter of the twenty-sixth, with the resolves to which it alludes.</P>
<P>The views of Congress, in sending general officers to the east∣ward to hasten on the troops, have been long antiscipated: ge∣neral Poor is in New-Hampshire for the purpose,—general Heath in Massachusetts-Bay, with the brigadiers, Nixon Glo∣ver
<PB N="52" REF="031423_0348_0FEC5CBB67409968"/>
and Patterson,—general Varnum in Rhode-Island, and ge∣neral Parsons in Connecticut. Generals Spencer and Arnold too have been desired to attend to the business. To these gen∣tlemen I have wrote repeatedly in the most pressing terms upon the subject, and I have no reason to doubt but every exer∣tion on their part has been employed to promote the end. The delay of those who have enlisted has arisen from the late pe∣riod when they engaged, and from their being inoculated since, which could not be dispensed with, without subjecting them to the calamities and ravage of the small-pox in the natural way.</P>
<P>At three o'clock this morning I received a letter from gene∣ral M'Dougal inclosing three from colonel Huntington, copies of the whole of which I have transmitted. By these, you will perceive the impression which a part of general Howe's army has made into Connecticut, and the prospect they had of de∣stroying such of our stores as were deposited in Danbury, which unfortunately were but too large and considerable, if the event has taken place. A circumstance, perhaps more to be regret∣ted, is that the enemy marched through a strong and rough country, and were near that place, without the smallest opposi∣tion. I have no other information upon the subject than what these papers contain: but we have little ground to expect that they have not accomplished their purpose. Further intelli∣gence will be probably received to-day or to-morrow, when I shall be happy to hear that they have paid for their enterprise. Of this, I confess however, I am not very sanguine in my ex∣pectations.</P>
<P>This post had been considered as a proper depository for stores, by gentlemen, acquinted with it; and its security not thought questionable whilst troops were passing through it. I had also directed that as many of the draughts in Connecticut as the place was capable of accommodating, should be collected there and inoculated, to answer the purpose of a guard, hoping, by the time of their recovery, that the situation of the army would be such as to admit a strong one to be stationed there, and continued; but, unhappily for us, such languor and supine∣ness prevails every where, that we seem unable to effect any point we wish, though never so important and interesting. So early as the sixth of March, I wrote to governor Trumbull, earnestly requesting two thousand militia to be sent to general M'Dougal to be employed at Peekskill and on the communi∣cation in West-Chester county for six weeks. With this requi∣sition he most readily complied so far as his orders were neces∣sary,
<PB N="53" REF="031423_0349_0FEC5CBFCECEB5E0"/>
and (I am certain) his influence would extend. This I have repeated, and this supply he has exerted himself to furnish: yet so ineffectual have his endeavors been, that not more than eight hundred had come out, by general M'Dougal's return on the seventeenth instant; nor did he expect more, from the ac∣counts he had. In a word, sir, no expedient or pains have been un-attempted by me to bring on troops, and to keep our affairs on a favorable footing.</P>
<P>I would again mention the case of our prisoners with the ene∣my, and pray that the secret committee would send to Mr. Bou∣dinot supplies of money for them as early as possible. They are in great distress, and many officers have lately escaped, con∣trary to the tenor of their parole; some of whom are now here, urging that necessity compelled them to the measure.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterstay honored with your letter of the twen∣ty-ninth ultimo, inclosing sundry resolves.—Agreeable to the directions of Congress, I have written to the states of New-Hampshire and Massachusetts, and urged them to complete and forward their troops destined for Ticonderoga, with all possible expedition. The brigadiers gone there for the present are Fer∣moy, Poor, Patterson, and Learned. Nixon and Glover were also intended for that post under my first plan, which was, that all the regiments to be raised in those states by the resolve in September, should compose that army. But having by the ad∣vice of my officers directed the route of eight regiments from
<PB N="54" REF="031423_0350_0FEC5CC402165128"/>
the latter to Peekskill, to wait till the designs of general Howe were unfolded, these two officers were to follow them.—I did not particularise the brigadiers who were to go first, or the re∣giments; but left the matter to major-general Heath, who was instructed in general terms to pursue such measures as seemed most likely to promote the service.</P>
<P>The colonels appointed to the New-Hamshire regiments I never knew. Those ordered to Ticonderoga from Massachu∣setts by general Heath, and who I presume have marched, were Bailey, Wesson, Jackson, Marshall, Brewer, Bradford, and Francis. What proportions of their regiments have marched, I cannot ascertain: but I am persuaded they were detached as fast as they were raised, and circumstances would admit. Fran∣cis's, the first of April, was returned five hundred strong; and, by a letter from colonel Marshall about the fifteenth of last month, he expected to march in a day or two with the last di∣vision of his regiment that was ready, which would make about four hundred, including those who had gone. The remainder (about sixty) were to follow with the proper officers as soon as they were fit,—the having been inoculated.</P>
<P>I have written to generals M'Dougal and Clinton to have the provision removed from Derby, &amp;c. and directed that they should point out proper places for its reception in Ulster; also that small works and guards of militia will be essential for its protection. * * *</P>
<P>The damage we sustained at Danbury, nor the enemy's loss, have not been transmitted with any accuracy: but, from the latest accounts from thence, the former was not so great, and and the latter more considerable, than was apprehended at first.</P>
<P>I congratulate Congress upon the fortunate arrival of the Amphitrite with military and ordnance stores:—it is an im∣portant event. That of the French ship at Boston, and of the sloop from Martinique, added to the capture of the two provi∣sion ships, are to be regarded as interesting too. I would here take the liberty to mention that I think all the military and ordnance stores should be moved without a moment's delay to Springfield or some interior part of the country. Springfield should be the place, because the elaboratory is there, and they will be more convenient to use as exigencies require. In their present situation their security is questionable; and, if an attack should be made in the eastern quarter, their loss is much to be apprehended. Before I quit this subject, I would beg leave to observe also that the disposal and direction of military stores
<PB N="55" REF="031423_0351_0FEC5CC8054A5308"/>
should be only with one body or with one person. At present this power is exercised through so many channels, that much confusion is introduced; and it cannot be avoided: nor will it be possible that matters in this line should be conducted with any degree of propriety, unless Congress come into some regu∣lations respecting them. The inclosed extract of a letter from general Heath will prove the expediency. Many other in∣instances might be mentioned, were it necessary.</P>
<P>The desertions from our army of late has been very consider∣able. General Howe's proclamation, and the bounty allowed to those who carry in their arms, have had an unhappy influ∣ence on two many of the soldiery; in a particular manner on those who are not natives. * * *</P>
<P>I could wish some means could be devised to cause more fre∣quent desertions of [<HI>the enemy's</HI>] troops. Congress may think of some expedient: a larger bounty might have some effect, and money to the foreigners in lieu of land. The bounty given by general Howe to those who carry in arms, is sixteen dollars as we are told, though his proclamation only expresses that they shall have the full value. To the inhabitants who will take up arms and join him, he promises land.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honored with your letter of the third instant, with its inclosures.—General Arnold's promotion gives me much pleasure. He has certainly discovered in every in∣stance where he has had an opportunity, much bravery, activity, and enterprise. But what will be done about his rank?—he will not act most probably under those he commanded but a few weeks ago.</P>
<P>I trust the appointment of Mr. Ludwick as superintendant of bakers will have the salutary consequence you mention; I have been long assured that many abuses have been committed for want of some proper regulations in that department.</P>
<P>By major Troop, one of general Gates's aides, and who left Albany on tuesday last, I am informed the accounts of general Carleton's approach towards Ticonderoga were premature. He says general Gates received a letter before he came away, from brigadier-general Wayne, of the twenty-fourth ult. in which he mentioned nothing of it;—that three thousand troops had arrived there, all in high spirits and health, except nine;—and
<PB N="56" REF="031423_0352_0FEC5CCB756EA278"/>
that that post could never be carried without the loss of much blood. The proceedings of Congress and your letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo were the first and only information I had of Mr. Carleton's being on the lake, having heard nothing upon the subject from general Gates or any other person.</P>
<P>In my last I mentioned that sixteen dollars bounty were given by general Howe to deserters with arms. I have reason to be∣lieve from information received since, and which seems to be generally credited, that he has advanced the bounty to twenty∣four dollars.</P>
<P>It is much to be wished that our printers were more discreet in many of their publications. We see, almost in every paper, proclamations or accounts transmitted by the enemy, of an in∣jurious nature. If some hint or caution could be given them on the subject, it might be of material service.</P>
<P>By a person who has just arrived here, it is reported that general Wooster is dead of his wounds.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congress that in a day or two our military chest will be exhausted. I beg that a supply may be forwarded as soon as possible: if there should be a failure, we shall have many things to apprehend.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered you by colonel Conway, an Irish gentleman in the service of France, who came passenger in the Amphitrite, and was introduced to me yesterday by a letter from Mr. Deane and one from general Heath, copies of which are transmitted.</P>
<P>This gentleman waits on Congress to obtain an appointment in the army of the states, and, from Mr. Deane's recommen∣dation, is an officer of merit. He says no particular command was agreed on between him and Mr. Deane; nor does he wish otherwise than that Congress should exercise their own discre∣tion; at the same time he observes that it will be mortifying to
<PB N="57" REF="031423_0353_0FEC5CCE996A64B8"/>
him to hold a rank under that of messieurs De Fermoy and De Borre, who were inferior officers in their own service, and sub∣ject to his command.—He can give the character of several of the officers who were passengers with him.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to speak of colonel Conway's merits or abi∣lities, of my own knowledge, having had but little opportunity to be acquainted with him. From what I can discover, he ap∣pears to be a man of candor: and if he has been in service as long as he says he has. I should suppose him infinitely better qualified to serve us, than many who have been promoted, as he speaks our language. He seems extremely anxious to return to camp, as the campaign may be expected to become active every day; and wishes Congress to determine whatever com∣mand they may think proper to honor him with, as soon as they shall think it expedient.</P>

<P>THE inclosed is a copy of a letter which was handed to me by monsieur Mottin de la Balme, from Silas Deane, esquire. For a more particular account of his merit and services, I must refer you to himself. I have sounded him as to his expecta∣tions, and find that nothing under a lieutenant-colonelcy of horse will content him. If you should, from his own account, or from what you can collect from others, think proper to con∣fer this rank upon him, there is no vacancy in any other corps except that of colonel Sheldon.</P>
<P>I am afraid we shall never be able to find places vacant, equal to the expectations of the French gentlemen who are now her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, much less for those that will follow. The high rank conferred upon those who first came over, many of whom had no preten∣sions either from their services or merit, has naturally raised the expectations of those who come properly recommended, to such a pitch, that I know not what will satisfy them. In∣deed it is not to be imagined that a gentleman and an old sol∣dier can submit to be commanded by a person in this country, whom he remembers to have been his inferior in France. I know not how we can remedy this evil, or put a stop to the growth of it, but by being very circumspect for the future, on whom we confer rank above that of a subaltern.</P>

<P>Inclosed you will be pleased to receive a general return of our forces in Jersey, the sixth instant, which is the first I have been able to obtain with any degree of accuracy.</P>
<P>I have not heard from general De Haas since his promotion. As soon as I was informed of it, I wrote and requested him to repair to camp: but, having received no answer, I am appre∣hensive my letter miscarried. I wish Congress to give him no∣tice of his appointment, and directions to join the army, if he accepts his commission and is not prevented by indisposition.</P>
<P>Through the board of war I have been favored with a copy of general Gate's letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo. Hudson's∣river and the passes in the Highlands I always consider as ob∣jects of great importance, and accordingly have provided for their security in the best manner my judgment could direct, and the circumstances of the army admit. If they are less se∣cure than we wish them to be, it is owing to our inability and not to inattention. I have written to general M'Dougal, and will do it again, to employ much of his care upon this subject. War, in theory, and the modes of defence, are obvious and easy; but, in practice, they are more difficult. Unhappily for us, the means in our power do not always accord with our wishes or what would be our interest to pursue.</P>
<P>As yet none of the eastern troops have passed the North∣river, except two small detachments from Connecticut and Rhode-Island, amounting to about two hundred and seventy, which missed my orders till they had got over. These I shall send back after we are more reinforced, unless the movements of the enemy in this quarter make their detention necessary. The rest of the eastern troops which have marched (except the seven regiments from Massachusetts and three from New-Hamp∣shire, ordered immediately to Ticonderoga) are at and on their way to Peekskill, as mentioned in my letter of the third,—where they are to remain with all the York troops except Van∣schaick's and Gansevoorts now at the northward, till general Howe's designs and intended operations are better understood. This disposition appearing to me and my general officers the best that could be made in our state of uncertainty, was adopted. The two troops of horse, recommended by Congress to be sent to general Gates, shall go as soon as circumstances will admit. At present we have not more than are constantly employed at the different posts.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="031423_0355_0FEC5CD21077CE18"/>
General Heath, in a letter of the thirtieth ultimo, mentions that the military chest at the eastward is exhausted, and that a supply will be wanted much to defray the expenses which will arise on the removal of the military and ordnance stores to Springfield. He says Mr. Hancock was to write upon the sub∣ject, and requested I would also mention it to Congress in my first letter.</P>
<P>Accounts have been frequently exhibited of late by the of∣ficers, respecting subsistence while recruiting and on their march. As I do not recollect the provision Congress have made in such cases, I wish to be informed, and to be favored with a copy of their several resolves upon the subject.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered you by general Arnold who ar∣rived here to-day in his way to Philadelphia. He seems to be anxious to settle his public accounts which are of considerable amount, and waits on Congress, hoping they will appoint a committee of their body, or of such gentlemen as they shall judge proper, to take the matter into consideration. This he considers the more necessary, as he has heard some reports have been propagated, injurious to his character as a man of inte∣grity. If any such aspersions lie against him, it is but reason∣able he should have an opportunity of vindicating himself and evincing his innocence.</P>
<P>I find he does not consider the promotion Congress have been pleased to confer upon him sufficient to obviate the neglect arising from their having omitted him in their late appointments of major-generals. He observes it does not give him the rank he had a claim to from seniority in the line of brigadiers, and that he is subject to be commanded by those who had been in∣ferior to him. He further adds, that Congress, in their last resolve respecting him, have acknowledged him competent to the station of major-general, and therefore have done away every objection implied by their former omission. These con∣siderations are not without their weight, though I pretend not to judge what motives may have influenced the conduct of Con∣gress upon this occasion. It is needless to say any thing of this

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honored with your letter of the tenth instant, accompanied by the proceedings of Congress of the day before.</P>
<P>The conduct of too many officers in withholding the pay of their soldiers, I am persuaded, is reprehensible, and has been the cause of uneasiness and of many desertions. Every measure in my power will be exerted to prevent such abuses in future, and every aid given to punish the offenders in an exemplary manner. But Congress will excuse me when I tell them it will be impossible to comply with their recommendation upon this subject, unless the general officers withdraw their attention from matters of the utmost importance, and such as require their constant care. Were this not the case, the dispersed situation of the officers at this time through the different states on the recruiting service would prohibit the enquiry. Nor do I ap∣prehend the regulations empowering and enjoining the regimen∣tal paymasters to bring them to an account will be found com∣petent to the end. Such officers will be proper to state the ac∣counts in the first instance, and to receive vouchers, &amp;c. but will not do to settle them finally, as their connexions with the regiments will subject them much to the influence of the of∣ficers.</P>
<P>I should suppose, if two or three gentlemen of integrity, and of ability in accounts, were appointed auditors to attend the army till the business is finished, it would be the best expe∣dient that could be fallen on. They would be a check on the paymasters, and, I am persuaded, will be the means of the accounts being fairly and justly liquidated. If a settlement can be once obtained, I trust the same confusion will never take place again, as the paymasters will receive and pay all money due to the regiments, and account for it, and as the army is on a more permanent footing than it ever was before: for this, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e most other inconveniences and difficulties which we have experienced, is to be imputed in a great measure to short en∣listments and the frequent dissolution of our troops.</P>
<P>A return of the army in Jersey, as late as the sixth instant,
<PB N="61" REF="031423_0357_0FEC5CD5ED101648"/>
I transmitted yesterday morning in a letter by Mr. Randolph of Chesnut-street, which you will probably receive to-day, and from which Congress will be able to determine the expediency of calling out the militia from Delaware and Pennsylvania.—Though it gives me pain that we should be under the necessity of recurring to such a measure, yet I should suppose it to be advisable. Our army is weak, and by no means equal to that of the enemy; and, till their designs are known and we are more reinforced with regular troops, we should be prepared in the best manner we can. I would observe, if the militia are called out, it should be for a fixed determinate time: for, though they will certainly return when that expires, yet that is more tolerable than for them to go off in parties every day as their whim and caprice suggest,—which has always been the case when the time was not stated. I would also observe, if it is possible, they should be engaged to march out of their states if ordered. If their service is located, they will move with great reluctance, if they do at all.</P>
<P>On saturday a smart skirmish happened with a detachment of our troops who attached a number of the enemy near Piscata∣wa, in which our men behaved well, and obliged the enemy to give way twice (as reported to me) with loss. The enemy re∣ceiving a strong reinforcement, our people retreated to their post.—I cannot give the particulars, as they have not been suf∣ficiently ascertained. The picquets were also attacked yester∣day by some of our parties from Boundbrook, and forced within their lines.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter of the fifteenth I had the honor to receive last night at eleven o'clock.—The commission inclosed for mon∣sieur Armand I shall deliver him as soon as I see him—Agree∣able to your request, I will give commissions to the brigadiers, and will ascertain their rank by their original commissions when I obtain them.—The inquiry directed respecting major Campbell, shall be made, and that be done which shall appear right.</P>
<P>I fear it will be hardly possible to satisfy the views and claims of some of the French gentlemen. The late promotion of monsieur Malmady, though highly honorable, and such as should be considered fully if not more than adequate to his pre∣tensions,
<PB N="62" REF="031423_0358_0FEC5CDA1B147AD8"/>
taken upon any principle, does not come up to his de∣mands. He arrived here yesterday morning, and has been writing to me upon the subject. From the high marks of dis∣tinction but too readily conferred upon these men in many in∣stances, they seem to have lost sight of what is just and reasona∣ble. It would have been happy for us, particularly for me and for the gentlemen themselves, if a too easy grant of favors had not induced them to contemn all rank in our army under that of field-officers:—nor is it in my power to give commands to every appointment. I shall inform monsieur Armand (and re∣concile him to it in the best manner I can) that there is no va∣cancy for him at present: and I would beg leave to suggest, that, where promotions are made in future from political and honorary motives, it would be well for Congress to explain to the gentlemen that it may be some time before they can be put in actual command. This might prevent their entertaining suspicions of neglect on my part, which the situation of the army will not allow me to obviate. There is no vacancy for mon∣sieur Malmady, of the rank he now holds, unless the merits of many other officers, who have served with reputation and much longer here, are to be overlooked to make may for him.—Such a measure will neither be practicable, nor prudent to at∣tempt.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heard who is at Pompton, I am in∣formed that colonels Barton and Burskirk with three hundred tory levies from Bergen, on the morning of the thirteenth, at∣tempted to surprise and cut off about seventy of his militia sta∣tioned at Pyramus. The officer happily had notice of their design, and eluded it by moving his post. It happened that the morning was foggy; and the enemy entering at different places, their parties engaged. General Heard says their loss could not be ascertained: but, from the reports of the inhabi∣tants, ten of their men were killed and carried away at one time, and several wounded.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG leave to inform Congress, that, immediately after the receipt of their resolve of the twenty-sixth of March, re∣commending the office of adjutant-general to be filled by the appointent of a person of abilities and unsuspected attachment to our cause, I wrote to colonel Timothy Pickering of Salem, offering him the post in the first instance, and transmitting at the same time a letter for colonel William Lee whom Congress had been pleased to mention, to be delivered him in case my offer could not be accepted. This conduct, in preference of colonel Pickering, I was induced to adopt from the high cha∣racter I had of him, both as a great military genius cultivated by an industrious attention to the study of war, and as a gentle∣man of liberal education, distinguished zeal, and great method and activity in business. This character of him I had from gentlemen of distinction and merit, and on whose judgment I could rely.</P>
<P>When my letter reached colonel Pickering, at first view he thought his situation in respect to public affairs would not permit him to accept the post. That for colonel Lee he sent immedi∣ately to him, who, in consequence of it, repaired to head-quar∣ters. By colonel Lee I received a letter from colonel Pick∣ering, stating more particularly the causes which prevented him accepting the office when it was offered, and assuring me that he would in a little time accommodate his affairs in such a manner as to come into any military post in which he might be service∣able, and thought equal to.</P>
<P>Here I am to mark with peculiar satisfaction, in justice to colonel Lee who has deservedly acquired the reputation of a good officer, that he expressed a distrust of his abilities to fill the appointment intended for him; and, on hearing that colonel Pickering would accept it, he not only offered but wished to relinquish his claim to it in favor of him, whom he declared he considered, from a very intimate and friendly acquaintance, as
<PB N="64" REF="031423_0360_0FEC5CE471809B80"/>
a first military character; and that he knew no gentleman bet∣ter or so well qualified for the post among us.—Matters being thus circumstanced, and colonel Lee pleased with the command he was in, I wrote to colonel Pickering on his return, who ac∣cepted the office, and is daily expected.</P>
<P>In this business I beg Congress to be assured, though colonel Lee was postponed in the first instance, their recommendation had its due weight; and that no motive, other than a regard to the service, induced me to prefer colonel Pickering. His acknowledged abilities and equal zeal,—without derogating from the merits of colonel Lee who holds a high place in my esteem,—gave him a preference: and I flatter myself the cause will be promoted in his appointment, especially as we shall have two good officers in lieu of one, who, I am per∣suaded, will do honor to themselves in the line in which they move.</P>
<P>Considering the passes through the Highlands of the utmost importance to secure, I sent generals Greene and Knox about a fortnight ago to see what had been done for their defence, and to consult with the general officers they should meet, upon such further measures as might be deemed necessary for their greater safety. The inclosed copy of their report will fully convey their sentiments upon the subject; to which I beg leave to re∣fer Congress.—I have sent General Putnam to command in that quarter, and have instructed him to use every possible means in his power for expediting and effecting the works and obstructions mentioned in the report. Fearing that the cables might not be procured in a time, I have directed his particular and immediate attention to fixing the boom. However, as the cables would render that more secure, and will be extremely serviceable in the opinion of the officers,—if they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be had in Philadelphia, I would advise Congress to order them to be purchased and forwarded without loss of time:—they cannot be got elsewhere. They must be proportioned to the width of the river, which is about five hundred and forty yards; and, as they will be of most use if diagonally laid, the gentlemen think they should not be less than four hundred and fifty fa∣thoms long, and of the largest size that can be had. Unless they are large and substantial, they will answer no purpose, and will not sustain their weight when stretched.</P>
<P>I should be glad to know whether it be the intention of Con∣gress that one of the already-appointed general officers may be assigned to the command of the light-horse, or whether they have in contemplation the appointing of one for this purpose:
<PB N="65" REF="031423_0361_0FEC5CE618575E78"/>
—if the first, I shall immediately name one to that duty;—if the second, they will be pleased to choose one, as it is time we should have our arrangements complete.</P>
<P>I have nothing of importance to communicate, unless it is that seventeen ships are said to have arrived at New-York on the twenty-second, and that others were in the offing. A re∣port has also prevailed, and has come through two or three channels, that governor Tryon (that was) is dead of the wound he received in the Danbury expedition: and one account is that lieutenant-colonel Walcot fell in the engagement at Ridgefield. I do not know how far the facts are to be depended on:—it seems certain that Mr. Tryon was wounded.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclosed is a copy of a letter received yesterday from general Howe. Congress will perceive, by referring to the copy of his letter of the twenty-first of April transmitted in mine of the twenty-sixth, that he persevered in his demand for an equal number of prisoners to be returned for those sent out by him; which has been the subject of controversy between us. As general Howe has called upon me again for my final decision upon the subject, and Congress are fully possessed of it, having received transcripts of every paper respecting it,—I wish them to take the matter under their earliest consideration, and to in∣form me as soon as they can, whether the grounds on which it has been conducted by me are agreeable to their ideas, and whether my objections are or are not to be departed from. The affair is particularly stated in my letter of the ninth ultimo to general Howe, in answer to the paper addressed to me by lieutenant-colonel Walcot; copies of which were inclosed in my letter to the president on the tenth of the same month. The despute, so fat as general Lee is concerned, rests at present on their declaring him exchangeable, as other prisoners are, on
<PB N="66" REF="031423_0362_0FEC5CE7E78E6378"/>
the principle of equality of rank; to ensure which, or his safety, lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Hessian field-offi∣cers are detained. The other objection to returning their pri∣soners is, that a great proportion of those sent out by them were not fit subjects of exchange when released, and were made so by the severity of their treatment and confinement, and there∣fore a deduction should be made from the list.</P>
<P>Good faith seems to require that we should return as many of theirs at least as we received effectives from them,—I mean such as could be considered capable of being exchanged; and perhaps sound policy, that the agreement subsisting for ex∣changes should continue. On the other hand it may be said that our prisoners in general, in the enemy's hands at present, will have greater security by our retaining them, and that ge∣neral Howe will be less apt to relinquish any part of his claim, the more the number in our hands is diminished by an ex∣change.</P>
<P>I confess I am under great difficulty in this business. But what is more particularly the cause of this application is the latter part of the first paragraph of the inclosed copy,—"<HI>and for your determination respecting the prisoners now here, that I may make my arrangements accordingly.</HI>"—This is couched in terms of great ambiguity; and I am really at a loss what inter∣pretation to give it,—whether he intends that his conduct re∣specting them shall be as I advise—(this appears more favora∣ble than can well be expected),—or that, if the previous de∣mand is not answered in a satisfactory manner, he shall consider them on a different footing from that on which our former prisoners were, and the agreement totally dissolved. We are told government offered the prisoners they took to the India company, and they have procured an act dispensing with that of the habeas-corpus in particular cases of persons supposed inimical to them, &amp;c. How far they or their commanders may adopt these measures, remains to be known:—I have only mentioned them as they respect the general subject of my letter.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding my recommendation agreeable to what I conceived to be the sense of Congress, lieutenant-colonel Camp∣bell's treatment continues to be such as cannot be justified ei∣ther on the principles of generosity, or strict retaliation; as I have authentic information, and I doubt not you will have the same, that general Lee's situation is far from being rigorous or uncomfortable:—except his not being permitted to go at large
<PB N="67" REF="031423_0363_0FEC5CEECB89A8B8"/>
on parole, he has reason to be content with every other circum∣stance of his treatment.</P>
<P>I am just moving to Boundbrook, from whence I returned yesterday morning. On monday morning a body of the enemy advanced near that post. They retreated, on seeing a detach∣ment march to meet them. There was some firing at long shot, but without any great damage. We had only three men slight∣ly wounded. What their loss was, I know not: three of their light-horse were killed.—By advices from the eastward, the troops are coming from Rhode-Island.</P>

<P>SINCE I did myself the honor to write to you the twen∣ty-ninth, I have received the inclosed intelligence. As it comes from a person of veracity, and one who is much in the confidence of the enemy, I have no doubt as to the fact of the two brigades having come over from New-York to Amboy, and also that a number of waggons have been brought from Staten and Long-Island. These accounts are corroborated by informa∣tion of the same kind from several different quarters. But I do not place so much dependence upon the account of the intended at∣tack
<PB N="68" REF="031423_0364_0FEC5CF060150340"/>
upon this place, because I think, if such a matter was really in agitation, it would be kept a profound secret: I rather am of opinion that it is thrown out to deceive. But at any rate, taking it for granted that they are assembling their troops and carriages, what can they have in view but a move, either imme∣diately, or when their reinforcement, (if they get any) arrives? and if they do move, I can see no other object but Philadelphia. It is true they have seemed for some time past to have laid a∣side all thoughts of attempting that city by land: but if they had only the attacking this army in contemplation, they would never encumber themselves with a large train of waggons, which, if they were successful, would retard them in their pur∣suit, and, if defeated, would be in danger of falling into our hands.</P>
<P>I inclose you an extract of a letter which I received from general Sullivan.—If the two India ships which have been cut down are gone out to sea, I should suppose they are intended for the Delaware, because they are not capable of performing a rough or long voyage. This, if true, looks as if a sudden cor∣responding move by land was intended; for they will never send their ships long before their troops.</P>
<P>These, you will please to observe, are mere conjectures upon circumstances: for the actions of the the enemy have for a long time past been so different from appearances, that I hardly dare to form an opinion. But I would wish to profit by every piece of intelligence, and be prepared to ward off every danger that threatens. I would therefore recommend that the Pennsylvania militia, who are assembled at Bristol for the express purpose of guarding the river and oposing the passage of the enemy, should be put under the command of a good general officer, who would see that they are kept to their duty, and prepared for a sudden emergency. Except this is done, they may as well be at home.</P>
<P>I last night received a letter from general M'Dougal, an extract of which you have inclosed. By this it appears that a reinforcement is arrived, but whether from Canada or Europe, is uncertain. You will observe that he likewise mentions, that eight transports with foot, and a schooner with horses and hay, had fallen down.—We can only form conjectures at present of the place of their destination: but if they stand southward, Phi∣ladelphia is the most probable place.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to communicate a very agreeable piece of intelligence which I have received from general Parsons, of the destruction of twelve of the enemy's vessels in Sag-harbor
<PB N="69" REF="031423_0365_0FEC5CF4F9444358"/>

<P>MONSIEUR Coudray is just arrived at camp, and pro∣poses to set out to-morrow for Philadelphia. What his views are, I am uncertain, having had no conversation with him upon the subject: but I find an idea prevails that there is an agree∣ment between Mr. Deane and him. that he shall have the chief command of the artillery. How well founded this opinion may be, I cannot determine: but if it be true, it may involve the most injurious consequences. General Knox, who has deser∣vedly acquired the character of one of the most valuable offi∣cers in the service, and who, combating almost innumerable difficulties in the department he fills, has placed the artillery upon a footing that does him the greatest honor,—he, I am persuaded, would consider himself injured by an appointment superceding his command, and would not think himself at liber∣ty to continue in the service. Should such an event take place in the present state of things, there would be too much reason to apprehend a train of ills, such as might convulse and unhinge this important department.</P>
<P>Supposing monsieur Coudray to have made such an agree∣ment, the case is of great difficulty, and, in my opinion, is wor∣thy of the most delicate consideration of Congress. Yet may not means be still devised to satisfy this gentleman by appoint∣ing him to some command not derogatory to his promised rank, and which will be agreeable to him? From the recommenda∣tions we have had of him. I am obliged to esteem him of high character, and of great knowledge in what he professes: and, from this consideration and the manner in which he is mentioned to us, it appears that much address and delicacy must be used, to conciliate matters.</P>
<P>Many reasons, besides those I have noted, might be assigned for continuing general Knox first in command in this depart∣ment, which, on reflection, will readily occur. I would only observe, without insinuating the most distant shadow of distrust of monsieur Coudray's honor, candor, or integrity, that, on the general maxims of prudence and policy, it may be questioned with much propriety whether so important a command as that
<PB N="70" REF="031423_0366_0FEC5CF8C4EDF680"/>
of the artillery should be vested in any but a native, or one at∣tached by the ties of interest to these states.</P>

<P>I WOULD take the liberty of addressing a few lines to Congress on a matter which appears to me of importance, and which is considered in the same light by many of our officers, and others not in the military line.—The subject I allude to is the condition of many persons now with the enemy, who de∣luded by their arts and a misguided attachment to their mea∣sures, fled from the protection of the states, to find security
<PB N="71" REF="031423_0367_0FEC5BEA65EBBF98"/>
with them, and who, in many instances, are in arms against us.</P>
<P>It has been suggested through various channels,—and the suggestion seems to be credited, especially as some have already escaped,—that many of these unhappy people, convinced of their error and the wicked part they have taken, would embrace the earliest opportunity of leaving the enemy and returning a∣mong us were they sure of being received into our friendship again, and of enjoying their property and the rights of citizens.</P>
<P>This subject, in the consideration of it, strikes me as impor∣tant, interesting, and delicate,—involving many consequences worthy of mature deliberation and attention. As such,—and, deeming myself incompetent to it,—I think it my duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sub∣mit it to Congress for their discussion, to take such measures therein as they shall esteem necessary and right.</P>
<P>If these people, particularly those in arms, are ingenuous in what has been hinted, and it is their wish, or that of any consi∣derable part of them, to return,—I should suppose that it would be expedient and founded in sound policy, to give every suita∣ble assurance to induce them to come. Such an event would be attended with salutary effects, would weaken the enemy, distress them greatly, and would probably have a most happy influence in preventing others from joining their arms. On the other hand, the indulgence may be liable to great abuse, sup∣posing it not to be duly guarded: or if the effects produced by it should be partial they will not be adequate to the ends in view. Yet, as the enemy on their part are using every device they are capable of, to seduce both soldiers and citizens from our service into theirs, and have succeeded but too well, it is generally though in the military line that something should be attempted to counteract them. Whether Congress will be of the same sentiment, and,—if they should,—what and how ex∣tensive the mode and indulgence ought to be, is entirely with them.</P>
<P>There is one difficulty which occurs with me, supposing the measure to be adopted.—What line of discrimination can be drawn upon such an occasion; though circumstances should differ and seem to require it? While the poor, deluded, ignorant, duped by artifices and a thousand causes to lead them wrong, have a claim to their country's pardon and indulgence, there are many of well-informed understanding, who, from their ear∣ly-avowed hostile dispositions and inveterate disregard of her rights, and those who have taken a double and triple part, can∣not have the same pretentions;—whose only view in returning

may be to serve their own sordid purposes, and the better to promote those plans they have steadily pursued.</P>
<P>One thing more I would observe, which is, that if Congress judge an adoption of measures eligible on the subject of my letter, the sooner it is come into, the better, for the most ob∣vious reasons; and the time allowed for those to return who wish the indulgence, should be fixed at a short period,—not longer, in my opinion, than till the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Left blank in the original.</HI></NOTE> day of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Left blank in the original.</HI></NOTE> next: otherwise they may avail themselves of the circumstance, and wait events to decide their choice. If any good conse∣quences are produced, the means can be renewed and further extended.</P>
<P>Congress will be pleased to excuse me for thus freely com∣municating my sentiments, especially when I assure them that they are dictated by what I esteem my duty.</P>

<P>P. S. The more I consider the subject of my letter, the more important and interesting it appears. I am inclined to think, if the measure proposed should be deemed expedient, that it will be better that the indulgencies and assurances for their return should be communicated through the medium of some second, secret hand, qualified to offer them and negotiate the business, rather than by an act of public authority. Op∣portunities, I should suppose, may be found, by which they may obtain due information in that way, and which will not hold out to the enemy the same cause of suspicion and of vi∣gilance to prevent their escaping. Whatever mode shall be con∣sidered most advisable, should be immediately adopted. What time should be allowed in the first instance, I am at a loss to de∣termine: if the continuance is too short, they may be danger of their not being apprised so as to get off: if it is too long, they'll defer matters to the last, and act then as circumstances of interest dictate.—To err in the former will be least inju∣rious.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS morning had the honor of your letter of the fifth with its inclosures.—The resolution of the thirtieth of May, respecting the French gentlemen who came passengers in the Amphitrite, reached camp before your letter, and has ex∣cited much uneasiness in the artillery corps. The inclosed copy of a letter from general Knox will convey their anxiety upon the subject,—which I think it necessary to transmit, as well from duty as on account of his request.</P>
<P>The difficulties upon this occasion arise from the peculiar circumstances of most of the officiers composing the artillery regiments at this time. I do not know, for my own part, what operation Congress precisely meant the resolution should have; but if the commissions which these gentlemen are to receive should give them rank from the date of those they had from the king of France, or from their compact with Mr. Deane, there are but few officers now in the artillery who will not be super∣ceded in their command, unless some method is adopted to pre∣vent it. This, I am persuaded, Congress had not in contem∣plation, because it is opposed to policy and to justice; and I am led to believe the resolution was come into for want of due information how matters were circumstanced in this instance.</P>
<P>The officers now in the artillery I am obliged to consider of great merit: experience has proved them to be most warmly attached to the rights of their country; and their conduct in the line of their profession has been such as does the highest ho∣nor to themselves and the gentleman who immediately com∣mands them. Without derogating in the least from the cha∣racter of the French officers who are to be commissioned, and whom I wish to receive every countenance they merit, there is strong reason to doubt (laying aside every consideration of policy) whether they have seen as much real service as our own in the course of two campaigns. It would be hard, not to say unjust, that the latter should lose their command when they have a claim to every mark of favor, and after they have taken great
<PB N="74" REF="031423_0370_0FEC5D096DE79A28"/>
pains to form their companies: the service requires that they should not; and I am convinced the event would be attended with the most fatal consequences.</P>
<P>But what is to be done?—This is a case of difficulty, view it as you will.—I am not for rejecting the French gentlemen:—far otherwise,—I am for employing them: and public faith, and the encouragements given to bring them over, demand that it should be done. After much thought and consideration upon the subject, two modes occur to me, as the only possible ones by which it can be effected, and by which the inconveniences I have mentioned can be remedied. One is, that a new corps of artillery should be formed, and these gentlemen attached to it. This we have reason to fear, cannot be done, from the difficul∣ties we have experienced in raising men, and from their having no interest or connexions with the people. Their situation in such case, if they are men of sentiment and active dispositions, would be irksome and distressing:—The other is, that our present officers now under consideration should have their commissions antedated, to give them precedency of rank: and this may be done with the greater propriety as most of them were intended to hold the posts they now sustain, before the French gentle∣men had any claim upon us. It is true they were not commis∣sioned, because the old corps existed under the first arrange∣ment. Further it is said,—and there is no doubt of the fact,—that those gentlemen were promoted by brevet just before their departure from France, merely to give them rank here;—ante∣cedent to which, our officers were superior to them in this point; and these brevets only confer local rank, confined to the French American colonies.</P>
<P>This latter mode appears the most eligible: if it is adopted, they will be distributed through the corps as assistant officers. Their want of a knowledge in our language incapacitates them for command in the first instance; and not only so, but to place them at the head of companies, over officers that have been at great trouble, pains and expense in raising the men, would be both unmilitary and unjust.—I shall now quit the subject, wish∣ing that whatever will best conciliate matters and advance the public good, may be done; suggesting at the same time with all deference, as it is much easier to prevent evils than to reme∣dy them after they have happened, it will be well, in all cases of foreign and indeed other applications, that the conse∣quences, which granting them will involve, should be maturely weighed and taken in every point of view. In the present case of difficulty, things, I am persuaded, might have been adjusted
<PB N="75" REF="031423_0371_0FEC5D0D033C2BB8"/>
with the greatest facility, had the committee of foreign appli∣cation been fully possessed of all the circumstances respecting the artillery regiments.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Gates, of the second instant, trans∣mitting a copy of one from general Poor, the enemy who were at Split-Rock according to their last advices which I forwarded, have returned down the lake. Captain Whitcomb had been sent out to reconnoitre, and reported on his return that only one boat remained.</P>
<P>From sundry accounts from New-York, there is reason to believe the enemy are on the point of making some expedition. Their preparation of ships for troops, light-horse, &amp;c. indi∣cates that they intend to go by water. What their object is, yet remains a secret. The inclosed copy of an examination is very particular, and as recent as any that I have received.—The person who gave the information belongs to Cape-May county, and appeared to be a sensible intelligent lad: A de∣serter of the seventy-first this moment came in: you also have his examination inclosed.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honored with your favor of the sixth instant, with its inclosures.—I am extremely happy in the ap∣probation Congress have been pleased to express of my conduct respecting the proposed cartel for the prisoners, and shall go∣vern myself by the principles which influenced me on that occa∣sion, and such other as shall appear right and just, should there be any further negociation on the subject.</P>
<P>I shall order a return to be made of the chaplains in service, which shall be transmitted as soon as it is obtained. At present, as the regiments are greatly dispersed, part in one place and part another and accurate states of them have not been made, it will not be in my power to forward it immediately. I shall here take occasion to mention that I communicated the resolution appointing a brigade-chaplain in the place of all others; to the several brigadiers. They are all of opinion that it will be im∣possible for them to discharge the duty; that many inconveni∣ences and much dissatisfaction will be the result; and that no establishment appears so good in this instance as the old one. Among many other weighty objections to the measure, it has been suggested that it has a tendency to introduce religious dis∣putes
<PB N="76" REF="031423_0372_0FEC5D0F307A33B8"/>
into the army, which above all things should be avoided,—and in many instances would compell men to a mode of wor∣ship which they do not profess. The old establishment gives every regiment an opportunity of having a chaplain of their own religious sentiments,—is founded on a plan of a more ge∣nerous toleration,—and the choice of chaplains to officiate has been generally in the regiments. Supposing one chaplain could do the duties of a brigade (which supposition however is inad∣missible when we view things in practice), that being composed of four or five, perhaps in some instances, six regiments, there might be so many different modes of worship. I have mentioned the opinion of the officers and these hints to Congress upon this subject, from a principle of duty, and because I am well assured it is most foreign to their wishes or intention to excite, by any act, the smallest uneasiness and jealousy among the troops.</P>
<P>There remains no room to believe otherwise than that the enemy are on the point of moving: this is confirmed by intelli∣gence from all quarters, and through so many different chan∣nels, that we must consider it certain. Whether they will move by land or water, or by both, cannot be ascertained; nor is their destination precisely known: but every circumstance points out Philadelphia as their object. Being of this opinion, I have directed the return of general Mifflin. Before he left Phila∣delphia, I wrote, countermanding the order for his coming here; but he did not receive my letter.—I would also mention to Congress that I think the military stores, lately arrived, and at or coming to Philadelphia, should be removed to a place of perfect security. Though I would not excite needless uneasy apprehensions, prudence requires that things so essential should not be exposed to risk.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLOSED you will receive a copy of a letter from me to lord Cornwallis, on the inhuman treatment of lieutenant Martin by a party of the enemy's horse. My remonstrance and sending his corpse produced nothing more than a short an∣swer from his lordship, which you also have. It was thought unnessary to view the body, the fact being admitted and justi∣fied.</P>
<P>I have also taken the liberty to inclose a copy of my letter
<PB N="77" REF="031423_0373_0FEC5D111F2868F0"/>
to general Howe, in answer to his of the twenty-first of April, twenty-second of May, and fifth instant. From the latter part of the first paragraph in that of the twenty-second of May, I was induced to propose an exchange of all the prisoners now in his hands, so far as it can be effected on the principles of the agreement subsisting between us, except that of lieutenant-colo∣nel Campbell and the Hessian field officers who are to be re∣tained till general Lee is declared exchangeable. I did not expect the proposition would be acceded to: but, as his letter is of doubtful meaning in this instance, I thought it expedient to make the offer,—first, as it will be a happy event if we re∣lease our prisoners,—and secondly, as the proposition may draw from him an explanation of his sentiments, though he should re∣ject it.</P>
<P>The New-York paper of the ninth instant I transmit for your perusal: it contains an extract of a letter from governor Tryon to Christopher Billop of Long-Island. This extract, I think, is worthy of attention, and may be improved to great advantage, if published in the papers with such strictures and observations as it will well warrant, and as will occur to an in∣genious pen. The enemy, on their part, use the most artful pub∣lications, and avail themselves of every thing they can, going from us. We should profit, where we can, by their produc∣tions.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congress that several officers in the corps of cavalry have applied to me, to know in what point of view their horses are considered,—Whether as public property, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as private belonging to themselves, to be furnished at their own expense. When colonel Sheldon's regiment was ordered to be raised, the officers thought the horses should be a matter of pub∣lic charge: but as it never had been determined, and I was not perfectly satisfied with the customs in such cases, I did not con∣sider myself authorised to decide upon it. I promised to recom∣mend it to the consideration of Congress; and this I have done since on similar occasions. The officers urge, that, as horses are essential to the discharge of their duty, they should be pro∣vided at the public expense; that they have risen to such enor∣mous prices, that, if the contrary is established, they must, from the nature of the service, not only sink their pay, but make a large sacrifice of their privaté interest.</P>
<P>Though the practice may have been against their application in other armies, yet their reasoning seems plausible, and to be founded in justice. There are objections too against the mea∣sure, but not of sufficient validity, in my opinion, to oppose to
<PB N="78" REF="031423_0374_0FEC5D1A2EEDBBA0"/>
their claim. Another reason may be suggested, why the pub∣lic should find them horses, which is, that if they were to pro∣vide them themselves, the apprehension of losing them might prevent a proper discharge of duty, and in some cases pro∣duce too great a degree of cautious prudence.</P>
<P>This matter I have thought it necessary to lay before Con∣gress, not doubting but it will have that attention which it may seem to deserve.—There is one thing more I would add upon the subject, which is if their application is considered just, I should suppose it best to fix a certain determinate sum to be al∣lowed for the horses they have bought and may have occasion to purchase, in preference to leaving it to their discretion and judgment.</P>
<P>It being evident, so far as we can reason from circumstances and appearances, that general Howe designs Philadelphia to be the first object of his pursuit, or the defeat of this army,—and, for one or both of these purposes, is collecting nearly his whole force at Brunswic,—a board of general officers determined yes∣terday evening after mature deliberation, that all the conti∣nental troops at Peekskill and its dependencies, except one thousand effectives, should be immediately marched to reinforce this army. That number, with the convalescents, and such aids of militia as are now and may be assembled in case of e∣mergency, was deemed competent to the defence of those posts against any attempts that may be made to possess them in the present situation of things.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a general return shewing our whole strength in Jersey at this time, from which it will appear our circum∣stances in this respect are by no means so desirable as could be wished. I esteem it my duty to transmit information of this sort from time to time to Congress, and am encouraged the more to do it from a conviction that the, sensible of the necessity of the most profound secrecy, will not suffer the least intimation of our numbers to transpire.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 14.—Your fovor of the thirteenth, with its inclo∣sures, was received last night.</P>
<P>Having proposed to general Howe an exchange of the pri∣soners now in his possession, as you will perceive by the inclo∣sed copy of any letter, and also added, that, "<HI>his conduct to∣wards prisoners would govern mine,</HI>" it appears to me that it would be improper to transmit him a copy of your first resolu∣tion of the tenth instant, till we have something more from him on the subject proposed. I confess I did not, nor do I yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣derstand the paragraph of his letter of the twenty-second ul∣timo
<PB N="79" REF="031423_0375_0FEC5D1CAA270400"/>
to which I have alluded, and which induced me to propose an exchange if that was his wish, and to subjoin, that his con∣duct to our prisoners should govern mine,—as a caution to pre∣vent him exercising severity on a new mode of treatment of them, contrary to the spirit of the agreement between us, and the ideas entertained upon the subject when it was first entered into,—if such was his meaning.</P>
<P>Finding that there would be great difficulty in filling the battalions intended to be raised, I did not commission officers for all the sixteen additional ones: I apprehend such a measure would accumulate expense without increasing our strength, and therefore did not set the whole on foot.—I shall be happy, on governor Coswell's letter and your recommendation of colonel Shephard, that he should have a regiment: from the character given him, and the terms on which he offers his services, there can be no objection. Congress will be pleased to appoint him to the command they wish him to have; and I should think it advisable that he be ordered to march with his corps to join this army, leaving proper officers to recruit the deficiency.</P>
<P>I have perused monsieur De Coudray's opinion about the fortifications, and have no doubt but that it is well founded. I have not sufficient knowledge of them to pronounce an opinion with certainty myself.</P>
<P>You will observe by the New-York paper the execution of * * *. His family well deserves the generous notice of Con∣gress. He conducted himself with great fidelity to our cause, rendering [<HI>his country essential</HI>] services, and has fallen a sac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣fice in promoting her interest. Perhaps a public act of genero∣sity (considering the character he was in) might not be so eligi∣ble as a private donation.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 15.—When I wrote yesterday, my information was that one division of the enemy was advancing on the Princeton road, and it was believed from the general movement of their army that they were proceeding towards Delaware. What their real design was, is not yet understood. Those that ad∣vanced on the road, after marching some distance, filed off to the right down Millstone river, and joined the other column on the Coryel-ferry road leading by Somerset court-house. One object of their movement might be to inclose general Sullivan and his division between their two columns: another (which most probable was the principal cause, if they did not mean to proceed to Delaware when they set out) to manoeuvre us out of our present encampment into action upon disadvantageous terms. The first they could not hope to succeed in after general Sulli∣van
<PB N="80" REF="031423_0376_0FEC5D209E61ADF0"/>
changed his post to Rocky-Hill,—an event which took place on the evening before, and which it is presumed they were not well advised of when they lest Brunswic. A consi∣derable body of them remain at Somerset court-house, and on the communication between that and Brunswic.—We have been and are harrassing them with light-troops: but they being in open ground with a large train of artillery, we cannot do it so effectually as could be we wished.</P>
<P>I shall be glad to be informed whether general De Haas considers himself an officer in the army. He has never joined it since his promotion, or written a single line to me upon the subject. If he accepts his commmission it will be well for Con∣gress to order him to repair to the army immediately. The brigade intended for him is without a general officer, and has brought on a disagreeable dispute between two of the colonels, each claiming the command. This is not the only inconveni∣ence:—officers of high rank remaining at home afford a bad example to others who are inferior, and grounds of application for the like indulgence.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honor of addressing you last, I informed you that the main body of the enemy had marched from Bruns∣wic, and extended their van as far as Somerset court-house. I am now to acquaint you, that, after emcamping between these two posts and beginning a line of redoubts, they changed their ground yesterday morning and in the course of the preceding night, and returned to Brunswic again, burning, as they went, several valuable dwelling houses. We had constantly light troops hovering round them as far as circumstances would per∣mit: but, being secured on their flanks by the Rariton and Millstone, they were difficult to approach; and, without loss, effected their return to their former posts. This sudden and precipitate change in their operations has afforded matter for much speculation. We suppose their original design was to at∣tempt an impression on our right, or to manoeuvre us out of our ground, or to advance towards the Delaware. Whether these conjectures were well founded, cannot be ascertained: but it is probable, if they had an impression in view, they found it could not be attempted without great loss—(as to bringing on an attack, they effectually secured themselves against one by the post they took)—or if passing the Delaware was their object, that, from the temper of the people, the prose∣cution of it (if not impracticable) would meet with much greater opposition than what they expected: for I must observe,—and with peculiar satisfaction I do it,—that, on the first notice of the enemy's movements, the militia assembled in a most spirited manner, firmly determined to give them every annoyance in their power, and to afford us every possible aid. This I thought it my duty to mention in justice to their conduct; and I am inclined to believe that general Howe's return, thus sud∣denly made, must have been in consequence of the information he received that the people were in and flying to arms in every quarter to oppose him. I shall not reason upon this event: but I cannot but consider it as a most fortunate and happy one to us, and the most distressing Mr. Howe has yet experienced, unless he has schemes in contemplation beyond the reach of my con∣jecture.</P>
<P>I should have written to Congress more frequently respecting the enemy after they came from Brunswic, had I not been al∣most constantly on horse-back, and had their designs been clear: but as they were not, I did not wish to puzzle them with con∣jectures, more especially as I wrote general Arnold (with whom
<PB N="82" REF="031423_0378_0FEC5D2A8772D470"/>
I was obliged to correspond, that he might co-operate with me as circumstances should require) to transmit them copies of my letters.</P>
<P>Inclosed you will be pleased to receive an extract of a letter from colonel Jackson of Boston to general Knox. The intelli∣gence it contains is interesting; and I shall be happy to hear that the two brigs mentioned have captured the remainder of the Hessians, and more particularly so if the capture should not be far from the British coast, provided they arrive safe.</P>
<P><HI>Twelve o'clock.</HI>—I just now received a letter from general S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uyler, a copy of which, and of its inclosures, is herewith transmitted.—The enemy, from appearances, having changed their views for the present, or at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east rendered them dark and mysterious, I have sent expresses to brigadiers M'Dougal and Glover to halt their divisions, if they have proceeded any con∣siderable distance from Peekskill, till further orders,—otherwise to return. I have also written to general Putnam, to hold four regiments in readiness to embark for general Schuyler's aid, should further intelligence from Canada respecting the enemy's movements make it necessary. The uncertainty of general Howe's operations will not permit more to be done at this time. General Parsons arrived here this morning, and his division is marching to their ground towards the left of the lines.</P>
<P>I omitted to mention in my last, that, in consultation with my general officers, it was agreed that promotions should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>mental in the army for all officers under the rank of field-officers,—and for all of that rank, in the line of their state. This is now settled as a general rule; a right being reserved however, that it may be made for patticular merit out of this line, or refused for demerit or any substantial objection.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honor and pleasure to inform you that the enemy evacuated Brunswic this morning and retired to Am∣boy, burning many houses as they went along. Some of them, from the appearance of the flames, were considerable buildings.</P>
<P>From several pieces of information and from a variety of cir∣cumstances it was evident that a movement was in agitation; and it was the general opinion that it was intended this morning. I therefore detatched three brigades under the command of major-general Greene to fall upon their rear, and kept the main body of the army paraded upon the heights, to support them if there should be occasion. A party of colonel Morgan's regiment of light infantry attacked and drove the Hessian piquet about sun-rise: and, upon the appearance of ge∣neral Wayne's brigade and Morgan's regiment (who got first to the ground) opposite Brunswic, the enemy immediately cros∣sed the bridge to the east side of the river, and threw them∣selves into redoubts which they had before constructed. Our troops advanced briskly upon them; upon which they quitted the redoubts without making any opposition, and retired by the Amboy road.</P>
<P>As all our troops, from the difference of their stations in camp, had not come up when the enemy began to move off, it was impossible to check them, as their numbers were far greater than we had any reason to expect,—being, as we were informed afterwards, between our and five thousand men. Our men pur∣sued them as far as Piscatawa: but finding it impossible to over∣take them, and fearing they might be led on to the main body, they returned to Brunswic.</P>
<P>By information of the inhabitants, general Howe, lord Corn∣wallis, and general Grant, were in the town when the alarm was first given: but they quitted it very soon after.</P>
<P>In the pursuit, colonel Morgan's riflemen exchanged several sharp fires with the enemy, which, it is imagined, did considera∣ble execution.—I am in hopes that they afterwards fell in with general Maxwell, who was detached last night with a strong
<PB N="84" REF="031423_0380_0FEC5D2F0C2FB0A0"/>
party, to lie between Brunswic and Amboy to intercept any convoys or parties that might be passing: but I have yet heard nothing from him.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When I had the honor to address you last, it was on the subject of the enemy's retreat from Brunswic to Amboy, and of the measures pursued to annoy them. At the time of writ∣ing, the information I had received respecting their loss was ra∣ther vague and uncertain: but we have reason to believe, from intelligence through various channels since, that it was pretty considerable, and fell chiefly on the grenadiers and light infan∣try who formed their covering party. The inclosed copy of a letter, containing the information of a person just from New-York, corresponds with other accounts on this head, and with the declarations of some deserters. Some of the accounts are, that officers were heard so say they had not suffered so severely since the affair at Princeton.</P>
<P>After the evacuation of Brunswic, I determined, with the ad∣vice of my general officers, to move the whole army the next morning to this post, where they would be nearer the enemy and might act according to circumstances. In this I was pre∣vented by rain, and they only moved yesterday morning. I have advanced lord Sterling's division and some other troops
<PB N="85" REF="031423_0381_0FEC5D3117A2CBE8"/>
lower down in the neighbourhood of Metuchin meeting-house, and intended to have posted more there; but found, on recon∣noitring the ground, that it was low and disadvantageous, and still more unfavourable through a scarcity of water. These rea∣sons, added to that of there not being the smallest prospect of attacking the enemy in Amboy with a probability of success,—secured on their flanks by water, and in their front by strong redoubts across the Neck,—would not permit me, either in my own opinion or that of my general officers, to keep any greater body of men in that quarter, where they would have been dis∣persed, and of consequence extremely insecure.</P>
<P>I have light parties lying close on the enemy's lines, to watch their motions, and who will be ready to act in conjuction with lord Sterling's division and such other troops as it may be neces∣sary to detach; though I think,—and so do the rest of the offi∣cers,—that no event is likely to take place that will require more, since the idea of forcing their lines, or bringing on a ge∣nearl engagement on their own ground, is universally held in∣compatiable with our interest, and that that number is sufficient to avail us of any advantages we can expect to arise from their retreating from Amboy, supposing notice of the fact should be obtained. Their contiguity to the Sound, and the small dis∣tance across it (having boats prepared to pass in), will enable them to get off (should they so incline) against every prudent and justifiable exertion on our part. Whether such is their de∣sign, is more than I can positively determine but there is every reason to believe that they have been and are transporting their baggage to Staten-Island, and making every preparation to embark on board their transports for some new expedition.</P>
<P>Your favour of the twenty-fourth I just now received, and am extremely obliged by your cordial congratulations on the e∣nemy's retreat from Brunswic, and favorable interpretation of the event to my conduct.—The resolution you did me the ho∣nor to transmit shall have my attention.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted, that an express sent off to general Maxwell on saturday night, to inform him of general Greene's movement towards Brunswic that he might conduct himself ac∣cordingly, did not reach him. Whether the express went de∣signedly to the enemy, or was taken, is not known: but there is reasons to believe he fell into their hands. If general Maxwell had received the order, there is no doubt but their whole rear guard would have been cut off. This the enemy confessed themselves, as we are well informed by persons in Bonemtown.</P>
<P>By a reconnoitring party just returned, it is reported as a
<PB N="86" REF="031423_0382_0FEC5D3327A60258"/>
matter of doubt whether any of the enemy have removed from Amboy; though it is almost certain they have transported a great deal of their baggage.</P>

<P>ON thursday morning general Howe advanced with his whole army in several columns, from Amboy, as far as West∣field. We are certainly informed that the troops sent to Stat∣en-Island returned the preceding evening, and, it is said, with an augmentation of marines, so that carrying them there was a feint with intention to deceive us. His design in this sudden movement was either to bring on a general engagement upon disadvantageous terms, considering matters in any point of view,—or to cut off our light parties, and lord Sterling's division which was sent down to support them,—or to possess himself of the heights and passes in the mountains on our left. The two last seemed to be the first objects of his intention, as his march was rapid against these parties and indicated a strong disposition to gain those passes.</P>
<P>In this situation of affairs it was thought absolutely necessary that we should move our force from the low grounds, to occupy the heights before them; which was effected. As they advan∣ced, they fell in with some of our light parties and part of lord Sterling's division, with which they had some pretty smart skir∣mishing, with but very little loss I believe on our side, except in three field-pieces which unfortunately fell into the enemy's hands; but, not having obtained returns yet, I cannot deter∣mine it with certainty; nor can we ascertain what the enemy's loss was.</P>
<P>As soon as we had gained the passes, I detached a body of light troops under brigadier-general Scott, to hang on their flank, and to watch their motions; and ordered Morgan's corps of riflemen to join him since.—The enemy remained at West∣field till yesterday afternoon, when, about three o'clock, they moved towards Spanktown, with our light troops in their rear and pursuing. The enemy have plundered all before them, and it is said, burned some houses.</P>

<P>I HAVE not been able to ascertain yet with any degree of precision the loss sustained by the enemy in the several skir∣mishes on thursday, though we have many reasons to believe it was much more considerable than what it was apprehended to be when I had the honor of addressing you upon the subject. The inclosed copy of a letter from lord Stirling contains the fullest and most particular information that I have received: and the accounts given by sundry inhabitants to persons who have been in the neighborhood where the skirmishes were, and where the enemy were encamped, countenance this intelli∣gence.</P>
<P>As to our loss, as reported by the enemy, I am persuaded it is exaggerated beyond all bounds of truth or probability, be∣ing assured by lord Stirling that it was trifling,—and by such deserters as have come in, that they saw but very few prisoners taken. It would have been certainly known before this (that is, the number not yet returned), had not some of the parties, and I believe the most which were then out, joined the corps since detached.</P>
<P>In respect to the enemy's designs or intended movements, they are not to be determined. It is certain they got into Am∣boy yesterday evening; and, from advices this morning from officers sent to South-Amboy to observe their motions, there were strong reasons to conclude they were evacuating the town, as their horse had gone over to Staten-Island, and as several boats were also passing with baggage, and others with troops. There were further circumstances favoring this opinion, such as apparent breaches in some of their lines: yet general Sulli∣van informs me by a letter just now received, that, from all the intelligence he has been able to obtain to-day, he does not think they have any serious intention of quitting it, and that all their movements are a feint, calculated merely to deceive, and to cover some plans they have in view.</P>
<P>I have two brigades,—Scott's and Conway's,—now lying at and near Woodbridge, as corps of observation, and to act as circumstances may require. General Sullivan was down in the same neighborhood with his division, till this evening, when he returned, it appearing to him unnecessary to remain longer, and that the brigades I have mentioned would be sufficient for any event likely to take place.</P>

<P>P. S. <HI>June</HI> 30.—From intelligence received last night, the opinion that the enemy are evacuating Amboy seems to be more confirmed.</P>
<P>As the facts in lord Stirling's letter are rather taken up on report than from any certain knowledge of their having hap∣pened, I cannot consider them sufficiently authentic for publi∣cation; nor are they transmitted for that purpose, though I am well persuaded the enemy's loss was much more considerable than it was at first imagined to be. It has been reported to me to-day that the enemy took sixty-four prisoners in the whole.—Whether they were all of our army, or in part countrymen, I cannot decide; for having detached at that time a number of light parties, and many of them having fallen in with the corps ordered out since, returns could not be made with accuracy.—The prisoners taken by us were thirteen, two of whom are light dragoons, the rest infantry.—Generals Scott and Conway intended to move towards Amboy this morning: but it is pro∣bable the rain has prevented them.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY afternoon the enemy totally evacuated Amboy, and encamped opposite to it on Staten-Island. Gene∣ral Scott entered directly after; and posting guards to secure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stores they might have left, he withdrew his brigade, and halted about four miles from thence.

<P>THE inclosed copies of general St. Clair's letters, trans∣mitted yesterday afternoon and last night by general Schuyler, I have thought it my duty to send you. The intelligence they contain is important and interesting; nor are there circumstan∣ces
<PB N="89" REF="031423_0385_0FEC5D431A71C680"/>
wanting besides these, to induce a belief, or at least to raise a strong presumption, that the enemy have in contemplation a junction of their two armies by way of the lakes and the North-river. If they have their whole Canada force on the former, it is certainly their object.</P>
<P>On receiving these accounts, I wrote immediately to general Putnam to embark Nixon's brigade for reinforcing the northern army,—to wait however the arrival or near approach of gene∣rals Parsons and Varnum's brigades from this place, who march this morning,—or the coming in of an equal number of militia to supply their place before they sail. This I have done by the advice of my general officers, and is all that is thought prac∣ticable in the present uncertain indeterminate situation of things. The rest of the army here will be held in readiness to move ac∣cording to information and circumstances.</P>
<P>As I have observed, if we were certain general Burgoyne was approaching Ticonderoga with his whole army, I should not hesitate a moment in concluding that it is in consequence of a preconcerted plan with general Howe, and that the latter is to co-operate with him, by pushing his whole force up the North-river, and aiming a stroke in the first instance and imme∣diately against the Highland passes. But as the appearance of the enemy on the lake may be a feint calculated to amuse and distract (though it may seem like a real attack), to draw this army to Peekskill and more to the northward, that general Howe may with more facility turn his arms against Philadel∣phia,—it has been determined unadvisable for us to move till we have further proofs of his intentions, and that our conduct must be governed by his.</P>
<P>Our situation is truly delicate and embarrassing. Should we march to Peekskill, leaving general Howe on Staten-Island, there will be nothing to prevent him passing to South-Amboy, and pushing from thence to Philadelphia, or in short by any other route; though the marching such of his troops from the point opposite Amboy as were encamped there, and the sailing of the ships from Princess-bay yesterday morning, are circum∣stances indicating that an embarkation has or will take place. On the other hand, if the North-river and the possession of the Highlands are his objects, our remaining here till his views are certainly known may subject us to a risk that we wish to avoid.</P>
<P>Thus, let us examine matters as we will, difficulties stare us in the face. We shall attempt to consult, and to do the best we can.—I have written to generals Putnam and George Clin∣ton
<PB N="90" REF="031423_0386_0FEC47A72B6878F8"/>
fully upon the subject, urging them to put forth every ex∣ertion in their power, and instantly to call in a respectable body of militia to aid in the defence of those important posts at this critical conjuncture. I trust they will come out: their services in all probability will not be wanted but for a very short time.</P>
<P>I must earnestly request that you will send Mr. Stewart, the issuing commissary-general, to camp immediately. There is reason to apprehend the army will be in great distress and con∣fusion for want of issuing commissaries in three or four days. On saturday, those with Mr. Trumbull declare they will leave him, without they are put on a different footing from what they now are. I need not mention the consequences that will result from such an event, if there are not others here to sup∣ply their places.</P>
<P>There is one thing more I would add, which is, that there are not more than forty thousand dollars in the military chest, and two months' pay due to all the army, except two or three regiments which have just obtained warrants. A hundred and fifty-six thousand, out of the last supply sent the paymaster, I was obliged to order to Peekskill for the troops in that quar∣ter, whose demands are great and pressing also. I must ear∣nestly entreat that you will forward a supply directly to the paymaster:—should we be obliged to move before the troops are paid, much uneasiness and murmuring will be the certain attendants, and, I fear, something worse.</P>
<P>As the enemy will adopt every stratagem and device to de∣ceive and distract us,—notwithstanding the present appearance in favor of their making an expedition up the North-river I doubt not but you will have the most vigilant look-outs kept along Delaware-bay, and proper expresses and signals for com∣municating the earliest intelligence. I think it would be high∣ly expedient that some sensible judicious men should be em∣ployed in that business at this time, who would view things as they ought to be, and from whose accounts certain inferences and conclusions may be drawn, so as to form a proper line for our conduct. The most fatal consequences may flow from false information at this period: things should be examined with all possible certainty. I shall not be surprised to hear of several ships appearing in or off Delaware, though general Howe's des∣tination should be elsewhere. Their fleet give them the most signal advantages, and an opportunity of practising a thousand feints.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honored with yours of the fifth, with sundry resolves of Congress to which I shall pay due at∣tention.</P>
<P>No change has taken place in the situation of the enemy upon Staten-Island since I wrote to you on the fifth: but I have this morning received an account from Elizabethtown, which mentions that a person had just come from the island, who informs that small craft are constantly plying between New-York and the fleet, laden with officers' baggage and stores put up in packages, and marked with their names and regiments; and that transports are fitted up with stalls over their main decks for the reception of horses. This looks as if a longer voyage was intended than up the North-river.</P>
<P>I have given notice to all the eastern states to be upon their guard, should the fleet put to sea and steer that way: and I think the works upon and obstructions in the Delaware should be carried on with spirit, and completed as far as possible, left they should visit that quarter. I think the southern states should also be advised of the uncertainty of the next operation of the enemy, that they may also be making such preparations as they may judge necessary.</P>
<P>I shall make inquiry into the number of arms at present at Springfield: and if any can possibly be spared to the state of Connecticut, they shall have all or part of those requested by governor Trumbull. General Knox expects the return on saturday from Springfield; and I can then determine the mat∣ter.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS morning received a letter of the seventh instant from general Schuyler, a copy of which, and of its inclosure, I herewith send you. The intelligence which they contain is truly interesting, supposing it just: but it differs so widely from what we had reason to expect from the accounts mentioned in general St. Clair's letters to general Schuyler (copies of which you would receive in his letter transmitted from hence last night by major Hoops) that I would fain flatter myself it is not true. I am the more encouraged to hope this, as captain Far∣mam's letter from Fort-Ann to brigadier Learned seems to be the foundation of the whole, and does not authorise the unfa∣vorable and unhappy conclusions built upon it. I should ra∣ther suppose, if any accident has befallen us, it must have hap∣pened to the detachment of men from the Grants, under colo∣nel Warner: for we find from general St. Clair's letters, he expected something from him.—The whole account is so con∣fused that we cannot establish any certain deduction from it; and I shall be happy if it proves premature and groundless.</P>
<P>I am told by a gentleman who came to camp yesterday even∣ing, that Nixon's brigade would certainly arrive at Albany on tuesday morning, as he saw the vessels, in which it was em∣barked standing up the evening before with a fair wind.</P>
<P>If the event mentioned by general Schuyler should not have happened, we cannot doubt but general Burgoyne has come up the lake, determined, if possible, to carry his point,—I mean, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possess himself of our posts in that quarter, and to push his arms further. Supposing this not to have happened, as our continental levies are so deficient in their number, our security and safety will require that aids from the militia should be called forth in cases of emergency: if it has, there is now an absolute necessity for their turning out to check general Bur∣goyne's progress; or the most disagreeable consequences may
<PB N="93" REF="031423_0389_0FEC5D4D384D5868"/>
be apprehended. Upon this occasion I would take the liberty to suggest to Congress the propriety of sending an active, spi∣rited officer, to conduct and lead them on. If general Arnold has settled his affairs, and can be spared from Philadelphia, I would recommend him for this business, and that he should im∣mediately set out for the northern department: he is active, judicious, and brave, and an officer in whom the militia will repose great confidence. Besides this, he is well acquainted with that country, and with the routes and most important passes and defiles in it. I do not think he can render more signal services, or be more usefully employed at this time, than in this way. I am persuaded his presence and activity will animate the militia greatly, and spur them on to a becoming conduct. I could wish him to be engaged in a more agreeable service,—to be with better troops: but circumstances call for his exertions in this way, and I have no doubt of his adding much to the honors he has already acquired.</P>
<P>In consequence of the advices from general St. Clair, and the strong probability there is that general Howe will push against the Highland passes to co-operate with general Bur∣goyne, I shall, by the advice of my officers, move the army from hence to-morrow morning towards the North-river. If such should be his intention, we shall not be too early, as a fa∣vorable wind and tide will carry him up in a few hours. On the other hand, if Philadelphia is his object, he connot get round before we can arrive there; nor can he well debark his troops &amp;c. and proceed across the land, before we can oppose him.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When I had the honor of addressing you last, I hoped the intelligence received respecting our affairs in the northern depart∣ment was not true, or at least that they were not so unfavorable as they were then represented. But the inclosed copy of a letter from general Schuyler, which came to hand yesterday evening, confirms it, most unhappily for us, in its fullest latitude. This event (the evacuation of our posts on the lake),—among the most unfortunate that could have befallen us,—is rendered more interesting by the manner in which it took place. I have no further information upon the subject than what the copy con∣tains, and shall be happy to hear by the next advices, that the main body of the army, of whose situation general Schuyler
<PB N="94" REF="031423_0390_0FEC5D52F93D84C8"/>
knew with certainty, have not become prisoners: for I fear, from the disposition they discovered on this distressing occasion; they would have surrendered to the enemy, in case they fell in with them, though inferior in number.</P>
<P>In respect to general Schuyler's demands, it is not in my power to comply with the whole of them. Not a single tent can be furnished: the kettles will be, and are ordered on; and an express is going to Springfield for all the musket-cartridges, sixty barrels of powder, and a proportionable quantity of lead and cartridge-paper for his use. Ten pieces of artillery, with harness, are also ordered, with proper officers, from Peekskill. I have written to him to procure horses and drivers himself, as they are to be obtained with much more ease where he is, than here: nor can he be supplied with the heavy cannon which he requests, supposing them necessary,—not having one to spare from a more important use,—the defence of the Highlands. Colonel Putnam, I imagine, will be with him before this, as his regiment is part of Nixon's brigade,—who will answer every purpose he can possibly have for an engineer at this cri∣sis. A supply of intrenching tools was sent him four or five days ago, in consequence of an application then made.</P>
<P>I should be extremely happy if our situation would allow me to afford him a large reinforcement of men: but I cannot with any degree of propriety, in the opinion of my general officers, send more to his aid at this time than a number of recruits on the march from Massachusetts state, belonging to some of the regiments under his command, who amount to six hundred at least, and are now, I expect, pretty well advanced towards Peekskill. With this augmentation to what he already has,—supposing general St. Clair and his force to have come in, and any number of his militia to have turned out,—he will have an army, equal if not superior to general Burgoyne's, from the only accounts we have obtained.—Besides this consideration, it is most probable that general Burgoyne will suspend his opera∣tions till general Howe makes a movement and an effort on his part. His designs, I think, are most unquestionably against the Highlands, and that he will attempt the execution as soon as possible.</P>
<P>We have been prevented marching to-day by the rain; but, as soon as the weather permits, shall proceed as expeditiously as we can towards the North-river, and cross or not, as shall appear necessary from circumstances.</P>
<P>In my last I took the liberty of suggesting the propriety of sending an active officer to animate the militia that may assem∣ble
<PB N="95" REF="031423_0391_0FEC5D5BD7534C58"/>
for checking general Burgoyne's progress, and mentioned general Arnold for that purpose. Being more and more con∣vinced of the important advantages that will result from his presence and conduct, I have thought it my duty to repeat my wishes on the subject, and that he may without a moment's loss of time, set out from Philadelphia for that purpose.</P>
<P>When this arrives, it is likely general Howe's intention will be well understood: but whether it is or not, as there are strong reasons to believe his operations will be up the North-river and on the east side of it, I shall take the liberty to recommend the sending on the North-Carolina and other continental troops at Philadelphia, to join this army, unless Congress have some information that a southern expedition is intended, of which I am not apprised.</P>
<P>If Congress have taken colonel Proctor and his corps into the service of the states it will be expedient for them to come on with all the field-artillery which colonel Flowers the commissa∣ry may have ready. This I have been induced to mention, ha∣ving heard Congress were about to adopt them, and as our de∣mand for artillerists is great. I would also observe that the si∣tuation of our affairs has become so delicate and embarrassing by the late misfortune we have experienced, that it is much to be wished some expedient could be come into, if there be any more efficacious than what has been already recommended, for filling and completing the several regiments. At present they only count in number, but not in force, being most shamefully defi∣cient in their just complement.</P>
<P>Your letter of the eighth was duly received; and, agreeable to your request, I communicated to generals Greene and Knox the resolution of Congress respecting them and general Sullivan, the last of whom I have not seen since it came to hand.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday evening honored with yours of the four∣teenth.—I have heard nothing from the northward since my last.—I this day received advice from Staten-Island, that, on sunday seventy fall of the enemy's ships fell down from the watering place to the Hook: but whether they have since gone out to sea, I have not heard. Till I have more certain information of the state of our affairs to the northward, and of general Howe's real intentions I have concluded to halt the army at this place, from whence I can either march forward or return as circum∣stances may require.</P>
<P>If general Nash should not have begun his march before this reaches you, be pleased to order him to proceed as far as Tren∣ton only, and there wait my further orders. In case he should have marched, be pleased to dispatch an express after him with orders to halt at Trenton.</P>
<P>I am pleased to hear that you have taken colonel Proctor's corps of artillery into continental service. You will be kind e∣nough to order them to join the army immediately: for I ex∣pect the light artillery in a few days from the eastward; and artillery-men will be wanted to man them.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but the militia from the western parts of New-England will turn out to general Schuyler's assistance, as I hope those of this state and Jersey will to mine, should they be wanted.</P>
<P>I shall be very happy if the committee of Congress can arrange the commissary's department in such a manner as will satisfy the officers concerned in the business, and at the same time serve to
<PB N="97" REF="031423_0393_0FEC5D659F2F3720"/>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG leave to congratulate Congress on the captivity of major general Prescot and one of his aides. The particulars of this fortunate event you will find in the inclosed extract of a letter this minute received from general Spencer, which, I pre∣sume, are at large in the packet Mr. Greenleaf will deliver. Lieutenant-colonel Barton who conducted the enterprise, and the small handful under his command, have great merit. I shall immediately propose to general Howe his exchange for that of major-general Lee, which if acceded to, will not only do away one ground of controversy between general Howe and myself, but will release lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Hessian field-officers, and procure the enlargement of an equal number of ours in his hands.</P>
<P>In mine of this morning I desired that colonel Proctor's re∣giment should join this army without loss of time. Upon con∣sulting general Knox, we are of opinion they had better halt at Trenton with general Nash till further orders, as the operations of general Howe are not yet perfectly understood.—I have nothing new from the northern department,—and only to add, that I have the honor to be, with great respect, sir, your most obedient servant,</P>

<P>I JUST now received a letter from general Schuyler, of the fourteenth instant, inclosing the proceedings of the council of war which he alludes to, a copy of which, and of his letter, I herewith transmit. He represents matters in a distressing point of view:—I believe they are bad; but I hope they are not so alarming as they are painted by him.</P>
<P>My letter of the twelfth would advise Congress how far his demand of necessaries had or would be complied with. In ad∣dition to the supplies then ordered, I directed a day or two af∣ter, six tons of musket-ball to be forwarded to him about Peeks∣kill with all possible expedition, which I doubt not, have ar∣rived

at Albany. As to sending him more troops than those mentioned in my letter above referred to, it is not in my pow∣er: and I am persuaded the force he now has, with such succour as may be had from the militia, if well conducted, would greatly if not effectually stop general Burgoyne's pro∣gress.</P>
<P>General Arnold arrived here last night, and will set out this evening for Albany. From his activity and disposition for en∣terprise, I flatter myself his presence and assistance in that quar∣ter will be attended with happy consequences: I am well assur∣ed his utmost exertions will be employed to baffle the enemy's views: and, wishing that they may succeed,</P>

<HEAD>To the Committee of Congress, on a visit to the Camp.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Camp at the Clove,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 19, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE little notice I had of your coming to the army, and the shortness of your stay at camp, will more than probably oc∣casion the omission of many matters which of right ought to be laid before you; and the interruption, which my thoughts con∣stantly meet by a variety of occurrences, must apologise for the crude and indigested manner in which they are offered.</P>
<P>The completion of the continental regiments is a matter of such infinite importance, that I think no means should be left unessayed to accomplish it. Draughting, where the powers of government are adequate, would be the speediest and most effec∣tual: but if it should be thought unadvisable to attempt th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mode,—next to it I would recommend that the business of re∣cruiting should be taken entirely out of the hands of the offi∣cers of the army, and that each state should appoint some person of known activity (one, for instance, who has been a good under∣sheriff) in each county or township, not only to recruit, but to apprehend deserters;—these persons to be liberally rewarded for each recruit and deserter whom they shall deliver, at stated periods and places, to officers appointed to receive, discipline, and march them to the army;—none of these recruiters to have the smallest power to act out of their own districts, but to be absolutely fixed to them.</P>
<P>A mode of this kind would, in my humble opinion, be less burdensome to the public than the present,—prevent the idle habits which recruiting officers contract, not only injurious to
<PB N="99" REF="031423_0395_0FEC5DBA4BFFC700"/>
themselves, but to others.—the most effectual means which can be devised for the recovery of deserters,—the surest way of keeping your regiments of equal strength, and of making the duty more equal in the detail of it: in a word many valuable advantages would result from it, whilst I can suggest but one reason against it,—and that (fully satisfied I am), when weigh∣ed in the scale of interest, will not operate,—I mean, the keep∣ing so many officers in camp, who might be spared from the duties of the field till the regiments are stronger than at present. The sixteen additional regiments labor under such disadvantages in some states, as to render the interposition of Congress, in some shape or other, indispensably necessary.</P>
<P>With respect to food, considering we are in such an extensive and abundant country, no army was ever worse supplied than ours with many essential articles of it. Our soldiers, the great∣est part of last campaign and the whole of this, have scarcely tasted any kind of vegetables,—had but little salt;—and vine∣gar, which would have been a tolerable substitute for vegeta∣bles, they have been in a great measure strangers to. Neither have they been provided with proper drink: beer or cider sel∣dom comes within the verge of the camp, and rum in much too small quantities. Thus, to devouring large quantities of animal food untempered by vegetables or vinegar, or by any kind of drink but water,—and eating indifferent bread (but for this last a remedy is provided),—are to be ascribed the many putrid diseases incident to the army, and the lamentable mortality that attended us last campaign. If these evils can be remedied, the expense and trouble ought not to be obstacles: though some kinds of vegetables are not to be had, others are, which to∣gether with sour krout and vinegar, might easily be had, if proper persons acquainted with the business were employed therein.</P>
<P>Soap is another article in great demand. The continental allowance is too small: and, dear as every necessary of life is now got, a soldier's pay will not enable him to purchase; by which means his consequent dirtiness adds not a little to the diseases in the army.</P>
<P>I have no reason to accuse the clothier-general of inattention to his department; and therefore, as his supplies are incompe∣tent to the wants of the army, I am to suppose his resources are unequal. Ought not each state then to be called upon to draw such supplies from the country manufactories, as can be afford∣ed? particularly of shoes, stockings, shirts and blankets,—arti∣cles indispensably necessary, and of which scarce too many can
<PB N="100" REF="031423_0396_0FEC5DBBD8E4E108"/>
be provided:—in the mean while, every provision to be mak∣ing, for clothing the troops uniformly and warm in the winter. It is a maxim which needs no illustration, that nothing can be of more importance in an army, than the clothing and feeding it well. On these the health, comforts, and spirits of the sol∣diers essentially depend; and it is a melancholy fact, that the American army are miserably defective in both these respects. The distress most of them are in for want of clothing is painful to humanity, dispiriting to themselves, and discouraging to every officer. It makes every pretension to the preservation of cleanliness impossible, exposes them to a variety of disorders, and abates or destroys that military pride, without which no∣thing can be expected from any army.</P>
<P>The consequence of giving rank indiscriminately is much to be dreaded: great dissatisfaction has already arisen on account of bestowing this on officers of the civil departments of the army, on the inferior staff, waggon-master, &amp;c. who, by custom, pro∣priety, and every other motive, are excluded from it in all well-regulated armies. The too great liberality practised in this respect will destroy the pride of rank where it ought to exist, and will not only render it cheap, but contemptible. It is the policy of all armies to make it valued and respected, as a stimulus to emulation, and an incitement to bold and gallant undertakings: it must be very unadvisable therefore, in our in∣fant state of war, to adopt novel customs to bring it into dis∣credit,—which must and will be the consequence of making it too common, besides the disgust it creates in others.</P>
<P>An auditor of accounts, to be constantly with the army, is absolutely requisite. It is impossible for me, crowded as I am with other business, to examine and adjust the numerous com∣plex accounts of the army with that correctness the public have a right to expect, before warrants pass for payment; and with∣out doing it, great impositions may follow. The provision for making regimental paymasters regulate all regimental accounts is altogether incompetent to the end proposed from it: for these men being appointed generally agreeable to the recom∣mendation of the field-officers of the regiments they belong to, associating constantly with the officers of their corps, and in a great measure under their controul,—cannot be considered as sufficiently uninfluenced: nor are auditors at a distance from the army of much use, as it would require a delay not admissi∣ble, to send accounts to them to audit before they were passed and paid in consequence of warrants from the commander-in-chief of the army.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="031423_0397_0FEC5DBE2511BF00"/>
A good geographer, to survey the roads and take sketches of the country where the army is to act, would be extremely use∣ful, and might be attended with exceeding valuable consequen∣ces. He might with propriety have the chief direction of the guides, and must have a head to procure, govern, and pay them. If such a person should be approved of, I would beg leave to recommend Mr. Robert Erskine, who is thoroughly skilled in this business, has already assisted us in making maps of the country, and has (as I am informed) uniformly supported the character of a fast friend to America.</P>
<P>A small travelling press, to follow head-quarters, would be productive of many eminent advantages. It would enable us to give speedy and exact information of any military transac∣tions that take place, with proper comments upon them, and thereby frustrate the pernicious tendency of falsehood and mis∣representation, which, in my opinion,—of whatever complexion they may be,—are, in the main, detrimental to our cause. If the people had a channel of intelligence, that, from its usual authenticity, they could look up to with confidence, they might often be preserved from that despondency which they are apt to fall into from the exaggerated pictures our enemies and their emissaries among us commonly draw of any misfortunes we meet with,—and from that diffidence of truths favorable to us, which they must naturally feel from the frequent deception they are exposed to by the extravagant colorings our friends often give to our successes. It would also be very useful to dispatch business in camp, being the most expeditious means of taking copies of orders or other matters that require to be dis∣persed, and would save a good deal in returns and other papers we are often obliged to get printed in Philadelphia. An in∣genious man, to accompany this press and be employed wholly in writing for it, might render it singularly beneficial.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly embarrassed how to dispose of the French officers in general, but more especially the artillery officers who are come out under the sanction of a compact. I can think of no other way than that of forming a separate corps of them, and draughting men from the whole line to compose that corps: but even this will be attended with many disagreeable effects:—among others this is not the least, that officers will think themselves much injured to have the men they have had the trouble of raising, taken from them and given to others. There is something in this which is discouraging, and breaks the spirit of a good officer who prides himself in having a full and complete corps.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="031423_0398_0FEC5DC1DCB405C0"/>
A doubt has arisen, whether a person who belongs to any of the United States of America, and who owed allegiance to any of the said states,—that went to the enemy some time past, and since that time has been lurking about any of the fortifications, or about any of the encampments of the armies of the United States,—plundering and driving off cattle to the enemy, re∣cruiting for them or committing any such atrocious crime,—or who is appointed an officer in the enemy's army,—can be tried by a general court martial, under the resolution of Con∣gress of the twenty-first of August, 1776, and punished as a spy.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have been under great embarrassments respecting the intended operations of general Howe, and still are, notwithstand∣ing the utmost pains to obtain intelligence of the same. At present it would appear that he is going out to sea. By au∣thentic information, there are only forty ships at New-York; the rest are gone elsewhere, and have fallen down between the Narrows and the Hook: between these two places, the number, from the most accurate observation, was about one hundred and twenty yesterday. As I observed before, their destination is uncertain and unknown: but I have thought it my duty to in∣form Congress of these facts, that they may give orders to the militia to hold themselves in readiness to march on the shortest notice, in case Philadelphia should be their object. At the same time I am to request that they will have a sufficient num∣ber of proper look-outs fixed at the capes of Delaware (to whose accounts implicit confidence may be given), to make the earliest reports of the arrival of any fleet,—which Congress will transmit me by the speediest conveyance.</P>
<P>As the enemy will probably make many feints, and have it unhappily but too much in their power from their shipping, I would advise that the look-outs should be cautioned to be ex∣tremely accurate in their observations and reports, mentioning with as much precision as possible, the number of ships that may appear.—Our situation is already critical, and may be ren∣dered still more so by inaccurate and ill-grounded intelligence.</P>

with general Burgoyne, I detached lord Stirling with his division to Peekskill on sunday morning:—they crossed the river that evening and the next morning. This movement will prove unnecessary, should his destination be to the southward. I have also ordered general Nixon's brigade from Peekskill to reinforce general Schuyler, from his representations of the in∣adequacy of his force to oppose general Burgoyne, and of the seeming backwardness of the people in that quarter to afford him aid.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honor to transmit you a copy of my let∣ter to general Howe, of the sixteenth instant, proposing an ex∣change between generals Lee and Prescot. I dispatched it ear∣ly the next morning, and presume it got to hand on the eigh∣teenth. As yet I have not received his answer.</P>
<P>The amazing advantage the enemy derive from their ships and the command of the water, keeps us in a state of constant perplexity and the most anxious conjecture. We are not yet informed of their destination, nor can any plausible conclusions be drawn respecting it, at least not such as appear satisfactory. What renders the matter still more difficult and confused, is their extreme inactivity and delay: for it is certain they began to embark immediately after the evacuation of Amboy, and now remain between the Narrows and the Hook, or were there when I was last advised upon the subject. I have two active officers, with an escort, now out for the purpose of intelligence, and for reconnoitring their situation from Fort-Lee and along the river in that neighborhood.</P>
<P>Things being thus circumstanced, and various opinions, as to their real object, prevailing among us,—some supposing it to be Philadelphia, others the North-river, and others an expedition more easterly,—I would submit it to Congress whether the mi∣litia of the neighbouring counties should not be immediately called to the first, or at Chester,—the lower counties, at Wil∣mington. This measure appears to me highly expedient, and no objection can lie against it, of sufficient validity to prevent it, as a few days must certainly determine their real designs.—Should they be against Philadelphia, and they have favorable winds, their voyage may be made in a short time, when it may be too late to obtain their aid, and to arrange them properly for defence, supposing them to come in. I am the more induc∣ed to recommend this measure, as the several objects we have to attend to necessarily oblige this army to continue at a consi∣derable distance from that place till their intentions are better understood; and as they might by a sudden and rapid push at∣tempt
<PB N="105" REF="031423_0401_0FEC5DCEF35F7570"/>
to effect some material capital stroke before we could get there, unless there is a respectable force to oppose them: for, though no great dependence can be put in a militia acting alone, nor a vigorous opposition expected from them (from the nature of things) to a disciplined, well-appointed army, yet their ope∣rations may be greatly retarded by them, and may be checked till other succours arrive. The report of a force, especially if it is in any wise respectable, let it be of what sort it may, will have some influence on their conduct, and may prevent enterprises that would otherwise be undertaken.</P>
<P>From the intelligence we received on saturday evening, that a number of the enemy's ships were standing up the North-river,—and in the course of that and the preceding day, that forty sail were in the Sound, going into Fairfield harbour,—I had not the least doubt in my mind but general Howe had in view a stroke against the Highlands and the fortifications there, and to co-operate with general Burgoyne. In consequence of these advices I judged it expedient to move the army the next morn∣ing, from our then encampment, towards those posts. Lord Stirling's division was ordered to take the route to King's-fer∣ry, and to pass the river to Peekskill; and I proceeded myself with the remainder, which composed the main body, by the route leading through the Clove towards New-Windsor. We marched over a very difficult and rugged road till night, when we halted,—the first division having advanced about eighteen miles. In this situation we lay till yesterday morning, when, from the information received before respecting the enemy's fleet being at or near the Hook, and no further accounts of the ships in the Sound, a change in our measures took place. Ste∣phen and Lincoln's divisions were ordered to proceed to Ches∣ter, (there to wait further directions, as a place from whence they may move with much more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase either to Philadelphia or Hudson's river, being seven miles nearer the former, and equal∣ly convenient to the latter) and general Greene's division to this ground. By dividing, and this arrangement, I am in hopes our movements will be more expeditious, wheresoever they may be necessary.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honor to inform you that I arrived here on the twenty-eighth at night with general Greene's division, one brigade of which passed the river that evening, that the whole might encamp the more commodiously.

<P>I have thought proper to halt the whole army at these two places and at Trenton till our knowledge of the enemy's desti∣nation becomes more certain. If the Delaware is their object, we are now within two day's easy march of Philadelphia, and can be there in time, I trust, to make every necessary dis∣position for opposing them.—On the other hand, if general Howe, by this expedition to sea, only means a deep feint, and should turn his attention against the North-river, we can from hence reinforce general Putnam's army more expeditiously than if we were farther advanced.</P>

<P>YOUR favor of this date, with its enclosures, is now be∣fore me.—At the same time that I express my thanks for the high mark of confidence which Congress have been pleased to repose in me by their resolve authorising me to send an officer to command the northern army, I should wish to be excused from making the appointment. For this, many reasons might be mentioned, which, I am persuaded, will occur to Congress upon reflection.—The northern department, in a great measure, has been considered as separate, and more particularly under their direction; and the officers commanding there, always of their nomination. I have never interfered further than merely to advise, and to give such aids as were in my power, on the requisitions of those officers.—The present situation of that de∣partment is delicate and critical, and the choice of an officer to command may involve very interesting and important conse∣quences.</P>
<P>It is certainly necessary that a body of militia should be im∣mediately

called out to reinforce the northern army. In the conference which your committee honored me with yesterday evening, I mentioned the number which I thought sufficient: but my opinion on this point, and the apportioning them to the different states, I wish to submit to Congress, who can best de∣termine the quotas that should come from each.—I would only observe, that Connecticut and New-York are already, and may be again, called on to afford succours to the army at Peekskill.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your letter of yesterday, and with its inclosures.—I shall pay attention to the resolves transmitted; and, as soon as circumstances admit, shall propose to general Howe an exchange between lieutenant-colonel Camp∣bell and the Hessian field-officers, and a like number of ours, of equal rank, in his hands.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to lay before Congress a copy of a report made by a board of general officers, held on the seventh instant, to consult of several matters respecting the army. In the course of their deliberation they took into consideration the subject re∣ported.—I shall only add that this matter has been long com∣plained of by the officers, and more so as the indulgence they pray could not nor can be ever attended with the least possible injury to the public, and is what I believe is allowed in most armies.—Congress, I am persuaded, will give it their attention,—and, if no good objections of a public nature appear against the measure, will grant what the officers wish and the board have recommended.</P>
<P>I perceive by the resolves of the thirtieth ultimo and first in∣stant, for recalling generals Schuyler and St. Clair, that they are directed to repair to head-quarters. I also find that a com∣mittee had been resolved on, to digest a mode for enquiring in∣to the reasons for evacuating Ticonderoga and Mount-Indepen∣dence, and into the conduct of the general officers of the north∣ern department at the time of the evacuation.—As these gen∣tlemen have received the letter upon this subject by this time, and will probably be down in the course of a few days, I shall be glad to be informed what to do with them when they arrive. I may then be at a great distance from this,—and, in such case, should be at a loss what to say, or how to conduct myself re∣specting them, without receiving some directions, which I re∣quest to be favored with by the earliest opportunity.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE disappearance of the enemy's fleet for so many days rendering it rather improbable that they will again return, I
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Probably</HI> August 9.</NOTE>
<PB N="111" REF="031423_0407_0FEC5DEF037F89D0"/>
have thought it advisable to remove the army back to Coryel's, where it will be near enough to succour Philadelphia, should the enemy, contrary to appearances, still make that the object of their next operation; and will be so much the more conve∣niently situated to proceed to the northward, should the event of the present ambiguous and perplexing situation of things call them that way. I was the more inclined to this step, as the nearness of the army to the city,—besides other disadvantages, afforded a temptation both to officers and men, to indulge them∣selves in licences inconsistent with discipline and order, and con∣sequently of an injurious tendency.</P>
<P>But before my departure I esteem it my duty to communi∣cate to Congress the result of my examination into the nature of the river-defence proper to be adopted, according to the means in our possession, to prevent the success of any attempt upon Phi∣ladelphia by water. I therefore beg leave to lay before Con∣gress what appears to me most eligible, considering all circum∣stances, and comparing my own observations with the different opinions of the gentlemen whom I consulted on the occasion.</P>
<P>It is generally a well-founded maxim, that we ought to endea∣vour to reduce our defence as much as possible to a certainty by collecting our strength and making all the preparations at one point, rather than to risk its being weak and ineffectual every where, by dividing our force and attention to different objects:—in doing this we may disable ourselves from acting with suffi∣cient vigor any where, and a misfortune in one place may pave the way for a similar one in another. In our circumstances we have neither men, cannon, nor any thing else to spare, and per∣haps cannot with propriety hazard them on objects, which be∣ing attended with the greatest success we can promise ourselves, can be productive of only partial and indecisive advantages, and which may possibly fail of the end proposed,—may have some serious ill consequences,—and must at all events have some disadvantages.</P>
<P>It is then to be considered where our defence can be most effectually made,—whether at Billingsport or at Fort-Island.—It appears to me that the last deserves greatly the preference: Billingsport has but one row of chevaux-de-frise: Fort-Island has three, and, in addition to them, a boom, and another che∣vaux-de-frise ready to be sunk in the channel on the approach of the enemy: of course the obstructions, in this respect, are four times as great at the one as at the other. The gallies and floating batteries that could be brought for the defence of the chevaux-de-frise at Billingsport would be unable to maintain
<PB N="112" REF="031423_0408_0FEC5DF12E433F18"/>
their station when once the enemy were in possession of the commanding ground on the Jersey side, to which they would be entirely exposed; and, notwithstanding the works raising there,—even supposing them complete,—the strongest advo∣cates for making our defence in this place do not pretend that the event can be protracted more than fifteen or twenty days at most; at the end of which time, we should be obliged, with the loss of our cannon at least, to abandon the defence, and leave it in the power of the enemy to remove or destroy the chevaux de-frise at pleasure.</P>
<P>Nor is it by any means certain that a single row of chevaux-de-frise would be an impenetrable barrier to the enemy's ships:—experiments have been made, that lead to a contrary suppo∣sition; and if they should hazard one (which it might be well worth their while to do with their less valuable ships) under favor of a leading breeze and tide, and should succeed in it,—the consequence might be the loss of our gallies and floating batteries, which I apprehend might be intercepted, and (with the assistance of their gallies and small armed vessels) taken: and this would greatly weaken the opposition we might other∣wise give at Fort-Island, and tend powerfully to render it abor∣tive.</P>
<P>But if they should not attempt this, contenting themselves with safer though slower operations, I have already observed that it is agreed on all hands, in fifteen or twenty days they would be able to possess themselves of infallible means of frustra∣ting our opposition there by the capture of our works. And if we add to this that it might very possibly happen in less time,—if from no other cause, yet from the garrison being intimidated by a consciousness of its own inferiority and inability to support itself against a so much superior force of numbers, which might occasion a conduct destructive to itself,—there will remain no sufficient reasons to justify the making of this the principal point of defence.</P>
<P>At Fort-Island, the boom and chevaux-de-frise are an ample security against any forcible impression of the enemy's ships, which it would be imprudent for them to attempt.—On the Jersey side, the situation of the ground is such, that the gallies, floating batteries, and forts, employed in the defence of the obstructions, would have little to fear from any batteries, erect∣ed there. Red-bank seems by its elevation to be the only ad∣vantageous spot for annoying them: but as it is computed to be above nineteen hundred yards from Fort-Island, the distance is rather too great to allow any battery raised there to act with
<PB N="113" REF="031423_0409_0FEC5DF2C380FCE8"/>
such effect as to be able to silence our fire.—On this side, the ground, by dikes and sluices, may be laid under water to so con∣siderable an extent as to leave no danger of our river force be∣ing annoyed from thence; for which purpose suitable prepara∣tions ought at once to be made, against it be necessary to carry them in effect.</P>
<P>But though a battery upon Red-bank would not. in my appre∣hension, be able to prevent the efficacy of our defence, or give any material disturbance to Fort-Island in particular, yet it might serve to make the situation of some of our gallies rather uneasy; and this perhaps makes it worth while to pre-occupy it in order to keep it out of the enemy's hands, erecting a small but strong work there, capable of containing about two hundred men; with six or eight pieces of light cannon and a proportionable quantity of stores. As the approaches to it are difficult on ac∣count of the adjacent creeks, and a communication can be kept open between it and our army,—by which means the garrison might receive succours from time to time,—though we could not expect to make it impregnable, yet we should have a pros∣pect of holding it much longer than we could the works at Billingsport. In the position, which, from my present view of it, I should think it best for our army to take, the left wing of it would be nearly opposite to Red-bank, and therefore in a condition to relieve and support it;—whereas Billingsport being more remote from the probable position of the army, and de∣tached from any other work, could not easily derive any as∣sistance from without, and must rely wholly upon its own strength.</P>
<P>Either at Billingsport or at Fort-Island, I believe there is not much to be apprehended from the fire of the enemy's ships unaided by land batteries: for, as by the information of those who ought to be acquainted with the fact, not more than three ships can act a-breast at a time at either place,—and as the gal∣lies, not requiring the same depth of water, can extend them∣selves at pleasure, and besides carry a superior weight of metal to that which frigates commonly have,—a much superior fire could be opposed to them than any they could bring, and (from the difference of size and make between the frigates and gallies) to much better effect than theirs. The comparative extent of the river at Billingsport and at Fort-Island has been assigned as a motive preferable to the former,—the river being narrower there than at the latter, and supposed to admit of fewer ships operating at a time: but as it is asserted by the gentlemen i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the river department, that the sand-banks and shallowness of
<PB N="114" REF="031423_0410_0FEC5DFA32F9AAD8"/>
the river in most places near Fort-Island compensate for the width of it, and make it impossible for more than three ships to act together at a time,—this reason for preferring the position at Billingsport seems to have no foundation. And if we consi∣der that our whole force of gallies and floating batteries would be collected at Fort-Island, assisted by the fort itself,—and that it would not be safe to trust them all out for the defence of Billingsport for fear of the disaster already suggested,—it seems evident enough that this is the place where our defence may be most successfully made.</P>
<P>One of the most weighty considerations with me is that our army, as before intimated, could more conveniently co-operate with the defence by water here than at Billingsport. The ground on this side is better situated here than at the other place: and the army being so much nearer the city, it is so much the less likely that the enemy should be able, by a cir∣cuitous route, to fall into the rear of it, and separate it from the city,—which is a circumstance that ought carefully to be at∣tended to.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen are of opinion that our principal dependence ought to be upon Fort-Island and its appendages; but at the same time, that we should make a part of our defence at Bil∣lingsport,—proposing, for that purpose, that the works there should be continued on the new contracted scale, to be garri∣soned by four or five hundred men. The reasons for this are, that it would serve to delay the enemy, and give our army time to come up, should it be at any distance,—and that it would prevent those disagreeable impressions which never fail to accompany the abandoning works that have been once rais∣ed, and plans that have been once in execution, especially when the persons concerned in the defence of them repose a degree of confidence in them,—which is said to be the case in the pre∣sent instance.</P>
<P>But these reasons may perhaps not be so conclusive as it is imagined: for it is a question, whether, if our army was so re∣mote as to make such a delay necessary, the enemy would em∣barrass themselves with removing the water obstructions in the first place, but would not rather debark and make a rapid march by land, possessing themselves of the city, and of those positions which would make the surrender of the gallies, &amp;c. in some sort a natural consequence. And it is worthy of consideration whether the abandoning the works begun at this time, which will probably allow some leisure for any disagreeable impressions it might make to be effaced, will not be less injurious than the
<PB N="115" REF="031423_0411_0FEC5D85D99FF790"/>
abandoning them hereafter when they have cost more expence, time, and labor, and in the critical moment of an attack, when every misfortune, and the loss of the most inconsiderable post, is too apt to have a much worse influence on the mind, than the real importance of it will justify.</P>
<P>Add to this the possibility that the garrison, dismayed at the approach of numbers so superior to their own, might not an∣swer the end expected from them, and might even be lost by their timidity;—the certainty of losing the cannon after the time limited for the defence, and thereby weakening that of the upper position;—the chance of losing the gallies and float∣ing batteries requisite for covering the chevaux-de-frise, by a hazardous and successful attempt to break through them,—and the garrison with them, which would fall of course upon such an event.—It is however submitted to Congress to balance the advantages and disadvantages, and determine accordingly. I would only beg leave to give it clearly as my opinion that our principal dependence ought to be upon Fort-Island and the obstructions there, and that Billingsport ought not by any means to be defended more than as a secondary object: and, to that end, I would recommend that the works on Fort-Island, which, on their present construction, are by no means calcu∣lated for the defence of the chevaux-de-frise,—be immediately altered and adapted to that purpose, taking care at the same time to make them defensible with a small number of men against any sudden attempt to land in boats and carry them by assault.</P>
<P>But, whatever scheme is pursued, I could wish the greatest diligence and dispatch may be used in bringing it to maturity: for, though the danger which lately threatened seems to have subsided, there is no knowing how soon it may return: and certainly it will be prudent to do every thing in our power to be prepared for it, as we can lose nothing by being so, and may lose a great deal by neglecting to improve the interval of lei∣sure they have given us, should it be their intention to revisit this quarter. As the means to this, it will be necessary to fur∣nish Mr. Coudray, to whom the superintendency of those works is intrusted, with a competent number of workmen, tools, and what other things he may want, to enable him to carry them on with propriety, ease, and expedition.</P>
<P>On the whole, I am of opinion that the obstructions in the river, with the help of gallies, floating batteries, and with to∣lerable industry to put the land works in a proper state, will be extremely formidable to the enemy, and authorise a reasonable
<PB N="116" REF="031423_0412_0FEC5DFDF08D2360"/>
expectation of their being effectual. The fire-ships also will contribute to this end: for though there are many obstacles to render their success precarious, and a happy concurrence of circumstances is necessary towards it,—any of which failing may disappoint the project,—and there is therefore no room to be sanguine, yet there is some probability of its succeeding; and they will be at least an embarrassment and terror to the enemy, and will oblige them to use precautions inconvenient to them, and serviceable to us.</P>
<P>As an accurate knowledge of the country is essential to a good defence,—and as the enemy's approach may be sudden, and we may be called to act, without having time, when it happens, to examine it sufficiently if it is not done beforehand, it would answer a valuable purpose to have it immediately carefully reconnoitred, and sketches taken of all the landing-places, great roads, and by-paths, encamping grounds, heights, rivers, creeks, morasses, and every thing that it can be of any importance to know. Marcus-Hook seems to be the most ad∣vanced place at which it is conjectured the enemy will land: the survey should therefore comprehend all the country be∣tween that and Philadelphia. Monsieur Du Coudray has of∣fered his service, with his engineers, to do this business, if au∣thorised by Congress, only requiring that they may be supplied with horses and a hand or two. If Congress approve of it, I shall be glad they may be desired to enter upon it without loss of time.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR Du Coudray has laid before me a plan of the river, by which it appears that, for a considerable space be∣tween the two sand banks on the east side of Fort-Island, there is from four to four and a half fathoms depth of water. Ac∣cording to this representation, there would be room for three frigates to lie between those banks in such a position as to enfi∣lade the works at Fort-Island, and make it difficult to maintain them.</P>
<P>There are but two ways of remedying this inconvenience;—one by having a sufficient number of chevaux-de-frise sunk at the entrance between the two banks;—and the other by having the left flank of Fort-Island fortification supported by a good battery capable of resisting the cannon of the ships, and obliging them to quit their station. The first is evidently preferable, because the efficacy of it will be more certain. A few che∣vaux-de-frise properly placed might effectually bar all access to the ships: but there is a possibility that any battery we can construct might be overpowered by the fire of the shipping: and as we have few cannon, and Fort-Island is itself a marshy spot, incapable of affording earth for the batteries necessary to be raised upon it, which must be brought from the opposite shore,—it would not be prudent to multiply works there more than cannot be avoided. It would also be a great advantage gained, to secure the island from annoyance except in one point,
<PB N="118" REF="031423_0414_0FEC5E09D3AB7A08"/>
and that in front, from only three ships at at a time,—which would be effected by stopping up the passage between the two banks with the chevaux-de-frise. I should therefore think it of importance to have this measure immediately adopted and carried into execution.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honor of addressing a few lines to Con∣gress on a subject which appears to me of infinite importance, and to have a claim in their serious attention. The matter I allude to is the exorbitant price exacted by merchants and ven∣ders of good for every necessary they dispose of. I am sensible the trouble and risk in importing give the adventurers a right to a generous price, and that such, from motives of policy, should be paid: but yet I cannot conceive that they, in direct violation of every principle of generosity, of reason, and of jus∣tice, should be allowed (if it is possible to restrain them) to a∣vail themselves of the difficulties of the times, and to amass for∣tunes upon the public ruin.</P>
<P>This grievance is now an object of universal complaint, and of universal apprehension: and the consequences that are likely to result from a continuance of it excite in every well-affected mind the most disagreeable feelings. The inclosed copy of a memorial from a part of the Pennsylvania officers shews their sentiments upon the subject; and I am persuaded those of the whole army are similar, as they have and do experience the gross abuses they complain of. I know that ways and means, for preventing this evil wholly, are difficult (if impracticable) to find out: but I should hope that Congress themselves, or the supreme powers in the respective states, through their recom∣mendation, may devise some mode by which it may be redressed in part.</P>
<P>I think there are two measures, which, if adopted and put under proper regulations, would be of considerable saving to the public, and to the army, at the same time that they would contribute a good deal to do away part of the uneasiness of the latter, arising from the enormous prices they are compelled to pay for necessaries. The first is the establishment of public tan∣neries in three or four of the states, under care of a judicious commissary or director, to which all hides of the cattle killed for the army should be carried, and tanned. There should be
<PB N="119" REF="031423_0415_0FEC5E0BC9903630"/>
also deputies to attend the army to collect the hides: and it appears to me that establishing the tanneries in different states,—for instance one in this, and another in Connecticut,—will be much more advisable than fixing only one in either of them; as the business may be carried on more extensively, with more convenience, and at less expense, than if the raw hides were to be transported to one place only, from which probably there would be a necessity of carrying them the whole distance back again after they were dressed.—This subject was under consi∣deration of Congress once before, and a commissary (if I recol∣lect, a Mr. Philips) appointed, who declined the office. Leather is of such essential use, and so indispensably necessary for shoes and other purposes in the army, that too much care nor too effectual means cannot be taken to procure it.</P>
<P>What I have ventured to mention, if gone into, will add much to our supplies, and, I am certain, will prevent the high and unjustifiable prices demanded for this article when in the hands of private owners. Besides, at those tanneries, a number of artists, such as shoe and harness makers, might be employed to work the leather up.</P>
<P>In like manner, since our imports of spirit have become so precarious, nay impracticable, on account of the enemy's fleet which infests our whole coast,—I would beg leave to suggest the propriety of erecting public distilleries in different states.—The benefits arising from the moderate use of strong liquor have been experienced in all armies, and are not to be disputed.—In the present situation of affairs, our soldiery cannot obtain such supplies as are absolutely necessary; and if they are fortunate enough to get any, it is from the sutlers at most extravagant rates, and at such as are incredible to tell of. This is a source of much complaint, and, I should hope, may be removed by ap∣pointing proper persons to buy grain and distil it for the army,—large quantities of which may be easily procured, and on rea∣sonable terms, in many of the states.</P>
<P>In respect to the observation in the memorial about rations, it is certain the present allowed value is by no means sufficient; nor does it answer the purpose intended. Since that was fix∣ed, provisions, like every other article, though not from the same causes, have become extremely dear; and what at that time was a just equivalent, is totally inadequate now. This matter, I doubt not, will have the attention of Congress, and such regulations be made respecting it, as may be right and e∣quitable.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="031423_0416_0FEC5E0FD174A890"/>
It appears to me from the information I have received, that two companies—each to consist of sixty men at least—under proper officers, of unsuspected attachment, spirit and activity,—should be immediately raised, to guard the laboratory and stores at Carlisle. Their security is of considerable import∣ance, and ought to be attended to. These companies, besides serving as a guard, will be frequently of use as escorts and con∣voys to stores.—If Congress should deem them necessary, and order them to be enlisted, yet I would recommend that they should not be raised as merely stationary or local,—having found from experience that regiments or companies formed upon such a footing enter upon other services with great dis∣content and reluctance, though the occasion should be never so pressing.</P>
<P>In a letter of the thirteenth of June, I submitted to Congress an application from the officers of cavalry respecting their hor∣ses,—whether they were to be provided at their own or the public expense. I also laid before them, in a letter of the fifth of July, captain Sullivan's requisition for pay.—I shall be glad to be honored with their determination upon these subjects, and also in general respecting the line of conduct I should pur∣sue as to the pay of officers taken prisoners at any time before the close of the last compaign, who have been permitted to be on parole;—and whether there is to be any distinction between such of them as are continued by new appointments, and those who are not. I have frequent applications in these instances, and wish to know how to act.</P>
<P>Since the express from general Schuyler left this, I received a letter from governor Clinton, a copy of which, and of its in∣closures, I herewith transmit, as they give a much more favor∣able account of the affair at Fort-Schuyler, than was contained in his letter.</P>

<P>THE unfavorable situation of our affairs in the northern department, and the pressing applications of general Schuyler for aid, induced me to write some time ago to general Putnam to hold Vancortlandt and Livingston's regiments in readiness to embark for Albany, in case I should find it necessary, and the succours he received of militia would justify the measure. I have the honor to acquaint you, that, by a letter from him,
<PB N="121" REF="031423_0417_0FEC5D815334F630"/>
of the sixteenth, which came to hand yesterday, he informed me, that, without waiting for further directions, he had order∣ed them to proceed with all possible expedition, as the late advices from that quarter seemed to make a further augmenta∣tion of the army requisite.</P>

<P>COLONEL Portail, for himself and in behalf of the gen∣tlemen with him, has made different applications to me for horses and servants; and I have been in a manner under the necessity of furnishing them by way of loan, till they can be otherwise provided. They expect these things to be found them at the public expense; and inform me that the matter is now before Congress, whose determination they look for every moment. I have taken the liberty to mention this, because I should be glad, if any thing of the kind is intended, that it might be done as soon as convenient; or, if it is not, that they may be informed their expectations are not well founded. This will put them upon providing for themselves, and prevent their repeating their applications to me on a subject which I am not authorised to do any thing in.</P>

As I had in some measure put them under the direction of monsieur Du Coudray, I did not chuse to give them a discharge without consulting you, though in my opinion they had better be suffered to go home than be kept discontented, as they will turn out with more spirit when they are wanted again.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the time which has elapsed since general Howe departed from the capes of Delaware, there is the strongest rea∣son to conclude that he is gone either to the eastward or south∣ward, and with a design to execute some determined plan. The danger of the sea,—the injury his troops must sustain from be∣ing so long confined,—the loss of time, so late in the campaign,—will scarcely admit a supposition that he is merely making a feint, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to return either to the Delaware or the North-river without performing some enterprise first in another quarter. The probability is in favour of a southern expedi∣tion, because he has been seen, since his departure from the capes, off Sinapuxent, steering a southern course,—and because, had his destination been to the eastward, his arrival there, from the general state of the winds, must have announced it before this, or his fleet would have been discovered by some of the cruisers on that coast.</P>
<P>If he is gone to the southward, he must be gone far that way: for, had Chesapeak-bay been his object, he would have been there long since, and the fact well established. Beyond that, there is no place short of Charleston, of sufficient importance to engage his attention. The extensive commerce, the vast accu∣mulation of military and other stores in that town and its depen∣dencies, with the eclat it would give his arms if he should un∣fortunately take it, afford him stronger inducements to direct his operations there, than he could possibly have elsewhere.</P>
<P>Matters being thus circumstanced, an important question a∣rises,—how this army is to be employed? If his intentions are such as I have supposed them, it appears to me that an attempt to follow him would not only be fruitless, but would be attend∣ed with the most ruinous consequences. The distance is so im∣mense that general Howe might accomplish every purpose he had in view, before we could possibly arrive to oppose him; and so long a march through an unhealthy climate at this season would debilitate and waste a principal part of our force. Add∣ed to this, after we had made a considerable progress, he might easily reimbark his troops and turn his arms against Philadelphia or elsewhere, as he should think proper, without our being in a condition to give the least aid.</P>
<P>As these, and many other reasons which will readily occur to Congress, will shew the impracticability of our counteracting general Howe in that quarter with any good effect, we have no other alternative left than to remain here idle and inactive, on
<PB N="124" REF="031423_0420_0FEC5E1D46391808"/>
the remote probability of his returning this way,—or to pro∣ceed towards Hudson's-river, with a view of opposing general Burgoyne, or making an attempt on York-Island, as the situa∣tion of affairs shall point out. A successful stroke with respect to either would be attended with the most signal advantages, and would be the best compensation we could make for any losses we may sustain to the southward. Besides these considerations,—if, after all our conjectures and reasonings upon the subject, general Howe should be gone to the eastward to co-operate with Mr. Burgoyne, the army will be, by the movement pro∣posed, so far on its way to prevent, I hope, the success of his enterprise.</P>
<P>The above reasons led me to call a council of general officers this morning, to take the subject of removing the troops from hence into consideration: and I am happy to inform Congress they were in sentiment with me upon the occasion, as they will perceive by a copy of the proceedings then had, which I do my∣self the honor of laying before them. Nevertheless, as it is a movement which may involve the most important consequences, I have thought proper to submit it to Congress for their deli∣beration and decision. If it is deemed expedient, we have per∣haps not a moment to lose in carrying it into execution; and, under this persuasion, I have sent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, (who will have the honor of delivering this) to bring me the result of their opinion.</P>
<P>As the northern department has been all along considered se∣parate, and in some measure distinct, and there are special re∣solves vesting the command in particular persons.—in case it should hereafter appear eligible to unite the two armies, it may perhaps be necessary that Congress should place the matter up∣on such a footing as to remove all scruples or difficulties about the command, that could possibly arise on my arrival there.—This I request, from a disposition to harmony, and from my knowing the ill and fatal consequences that have often arisen from such controversies, and not from the most distant appre∣hension that one would take place upon such an event. The thing however is possible, and to guard against it can do injury.</P>

<P>I AM this moment honored with yours of this morning, containing several pieces of intelligence of the fleet's having been seen off the capes of Virginia on the fifteenth instant.—I shall, in consequence of this information, halt upon my pre∣sent ground till I hear something further.</P>
<P>Colonel Pinckney of South-Carolina paid me a visit two days ago. He informed me that the military stores in Charleston and the neighborhood were immense, and that he did not be∣lieve that the governor or commanding officer there had had the least intimation of the fleet's having stood to the southward; and he seemed very apprehensive, that, if Charleston was their object, they would find them lulled into security, and quite un∣prepared for an attack.—As I cannot yet think that general Howe seriously intends to go into Chesapeak, I would by all means advise that an express be immediately dispatched (if one has not already gone) to warn them of their danger, to let them prepare in the best manner for defence, and to advise them to remove all supernumerary stores.</P>
<P>I shall immediately call upon governor Livingston to furnish the number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the state of Jersey, demanded by re∣quisition of Congress, to garrison the forts in the Highlands, while the New-York militia march to reinforce the northern army.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you that the army marched early this morning, and will encamp, I expect, this evening, within five or six miles of Philadelphia. To-morrow morning it will move again, and I think to march it through the city, but without halting. I am induced to do this, from the opinion of several of my officers and many friends in Philadelphia, that it may have some influence on the minds of the disaffected there, and those who are dupes to their artifices and opinions. The march will be down Front and up Chesnut-street, and, I pre∣sume, about seven o'clock.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the arrival of the enemy's fleet in Chesa∣peak-bay, and the seeming probability that general Howe will debark his troops and attempt something, yet I would take the liberty to mention that I think the several works for the de∣fence of the city should be carried on with the usual industry, and that no pains should be omitted to complete them. I would also advise that the same look-outs for intelligence should be continued at the capes, and the earliest information communi∣cated of any thing material: for, though the fleet is in Chesa∣peak-bay, the enemy may push in a number of vessels with troops, and make an effort to effect some stroke against Phila∣delphia by surprise. Such an event does not seem probable while they have a larger shew of force in a neighboring state: but it will be prudent to guard against it.</P>

But few tents were to be seen from Iron-hill and Gray's-bill, which are the only eminences about Elk. I am happy to inform you that all the public stores are removed from thence, except about seven thousand bushels of corn. This I urged the commissary to get off as soon as possible, and hope it will be effected in a few days, if the enemy should not prevent, which their situation gives them but too easy an opportunity of doing. The scarcity of teams in proportion to the demand will render the removal rather tedious, though I have directed the quarter-master to send some from hence to expedite the mea∣sure.</P>

<P>HAVING endeavored, at the solicitation of the count De Pulaski, to think of some mode for employing him in our ser∣vice, there is none occurs to me, liable to so few inconvenien∣cies and exceptions as the giving him the command of the horse. This department is still without a head, as I have not, in the present deficiency of brigadiers with the army, thought it advis∣able to take one from the foot for that command. The nature of the horse service with us being such that they commonly act in detachments, a general officer with them is less necessary than at the head of the brigades of infantry. In the absence of ge∣neral Smallwood, who is ordered to put himself at the head of the Maryland militia, we shall have two brigades without gene∣ral officers.</P>
<P>But though the horse will suffer less from the want of a ge∣neral officer than the foot, a man of real capacity, experience, and knowledge in that service, might be extremely useful. The count appears, by his recommendations, to have sustained no in∣considerable military character in his own country: and as the

<P>This gentleman, we are told, has been, like us, engaged in defending the liberty and independence of his country, and has sacrificed his fortune to his zeal for those objects.

<P>The enemy advanced a part of their army yesterday to Gray's-Hill about two miles on this side of Elk,—whether with intent to take post there, or to cover while they remove what stores they found in the town, I cannot yet determine.—I do not know what quantity of private property remained: but of the public there were several thousand bushels of corn and oats, which might have been removed also, had not most of the teams in the country been employed by private persons in bringing off very valuable goods.</P>
<P>Our light parties yesterday took between thirty and forty prisoners; twelve deserters from the navy and eight from the army have already come in; but they are able to give us very little intelligence. They generally agree that their troops are healthy, but that their horses suffered very much by the voyage.</P>

<P>THE latest and most material intelligence which I have obtained respecting the enemy, you will find in the inclosed pa∣pers which I do myself the honor of transmitting to you.</P>
<P>How far the enemy have it in view to extend themselves in a line from bay to bay, I cannot determine: but the idea has taken place with many: and it is said to be founded on their hints to some persons, who,—from accident in some instances, and perhaps choice in others,—have had a more familiar inter∣course with them. I cannot suppose they have any such design, or, if they have, that it can be more than temporary for procu∣ring supplies of provisions.</P>
<P>General Howe's declaration is agreeable to his constant usage, and is what we might reasonably expect. The only difference is, the present exhibition is styled a <HI>'declaration.'</HI> It is another effort to seduce the people to give up their rights, and to encou∣rage our soldiers to desert. The facts contained in the deposi∣tion of Francis Alexander, which you have also inclosed, seem to be opposed to that regularity and discipline which are pro∣mised by the declaration.</P>
<P>Yesterday there was some skirmishing between one of our advanced parties and one of the enemy's, in which they were obliged to retreat with the loss of an officer and three men kil∣led, according to report.—We had one private wounded.</P>
<P>I have received no particular accounts respecting the Mary∣land Eastern-Shore militia: from the best information I have, a great many are well disposed to turn out, but are prevented

<P>I THIS minute returned to head-quarters where I found your favor of this date, with the resolves respecting general Sul∣livan, and colonel Richardson's battalion.—I had conversed with general Sullivan upon the subject, and observed to him that it was necessary an inquiry should be had relative to the affair of Staten-Island, as his conduct was censured, and much dissatisfaction prevailed. He was sensible of the propriety of the measure, and expressed a desire that it should take place, pro∣vided
<PB N="132" REF="031423_0428_0FEC5E29E9C008B8"/>
he could have the benefit of general Smallwood's testimo∣ny, who was on the expedition.—That gentlemen happens at this time to be in Maryland; which must necessarily delay the inquiry, unless some mode can be agreed upon for obtaining his sentiments upon the matter.</P>
<P>This morning the enemy came out with a considerable force and three pieces of artillery, against our light advanced corps, and, after some pretty smart skirmishing, obliged them to re∣treat,—being far inferior in number, and without cannon.—The loss on either side is not yet ascertained: ours, though not exactly known, is not very considerable: theirs, we have reason to believe, was much greater, as some of our parties, composed of expert marksmen, had opportunities of giving them several close, well-directed fires,—more particularly in one instance, when a body of riflemen formed a kind of ambuscade.—They advanced about two miles this side of Iron-Hill, and then with∣drew to that place, leaving a piquet at Couch's mill, about a mile in front. Our parties now lie at White-Clay creek, ex∣cept the advanced piquets, which are at Christiana bridge.</P>
<P>Our monday a large detachment of the enemy landed at Ce∣cil court-house; and this morning I had advice of their having advanced on the Newcastle road as far as Carson's tavern. Parties of horse were sent out to reconnoitre them, which went three miles beyond the Red-Lion, but could neither see nor hear of them; whence I conjectured they filed off by a road to their left, and fell in with their main body.—The design of their movement this morning seems to have been to disperse our light troops who had been troublesome to them, and to gain possession of Iron-Hill, to establish a post most probably for covering their retreat in case of accidents.</P>

I have desired general Rodney to inquire into this matter, and, if it be true, to send persons along the bay shore to see where they lie.—General Maxwell, who is just come up from the lines, confirms the ac∣count of the shipping having fallen down Elk: but it is thought

<P>P. S. We have not been able to ascertain the enemy's loss in the late action any other way than by a woman who came from their camp yesterday:—she says she saw nine waggon∣loads of wounded. I think this probable, because we had a∣bout forty killed and wounded; and, as our men were thinly posted, they must have done more damage upon a close body, than they received.</P>

<P>HIS excellency being out reconnoitring, and busily enga∣ged in the affairs of the army, I have the honor to acknowledge his receipt of your letter of the sixth, with the resolutions in∣closed, which came to hand yesterday afternoon.</P>
<P>In respect to the militia requested of Jersey, his excellency is doubtful whether they can be obtained: for governor Li∣vingston, by a late letter, informed him that he had no expect∣ation that more than three hundred, of the thousand called for to garrison the posts in the Highlands, would march, notwith∣standing he has issued orders for that purpose; and that three weeks would probably elapse before that number went. If the requisition can be complied with, he has no doubt of general Dickinson's exertions, and is satisfied of the propriety of ap∣pointing him to the command. This, he imagines, would have followed of course, as he is major-general of all the militia in the state, and has given ample testimony, as well of his capa∣city as of his firmness and bravery.</P>
<P>By deserters and other intelligence, his excellency was in∣formed last night that the enemy's whole force left Elk yester∣day, and advanced on the road towards Christiana. The de∣serters added that they had disencumbered themselves of all their tents and baggage, and had sent them back and reimbark∣ed them. All their ships, except two or three which are ships of war, are said to have fallen down the bay, below the mouth of Sassafras.—We have had no information to-day of any fur∣ther movements; and I believe their main body lies about Iron-Hill.</P>

<P>THE enemy advanced yesterday with a seeming intention of attacking us upon our post near Newport. We waited for them the whole day; but they halted in the evening at a place called Milltown, about two miles from us.—Upon reconnoitring their situation, it appeared probable that they only meant to a∣muse us in front, while their real intent was to march by our right, and, by suddenly passing the Brandywine and gaining the heights upon the north side of that river, get between us and Philadelphia, and cut us off from that city. To prevent this, it was judged expedient to change our position immediately: the army accordingly marched at two o'clock this morning, and will take post this evening upon the high grounds near Chad's Ford.—We have heard nothing circumstantial from the enemy this day: when I do, I shall immediately transmit you an account.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY evening I received the honor of your letter of the ninth, with its several inclosures.—I have written to general Putnam to detach the fifteen hundred men mention∣ed by Congress, and inclose my letter upon the subject, which you will be pleased to forward to him by the earliest opportu∣nity.</P>
<P>In respect to the subject of monsieur Du Coudray's letter, I would beg leave to observe, however eligible the measure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight otherwise be which he recommends, an attempt to carry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into execution at this time would answer no valuable pur∣pose, as the work in all probability could not be more than marked out when it would be wanted. I would also add that I do not conceive any great advantages could be derived from it, supposing it could be completed,—as we are certain the ene∣my will never attack lines which they can avoid. If they were obliged to approach Philadelphia by a particular route, in such case no exertions should be spared to erect works, and the a∣doption of the plan would be highly expedient.</P>
<P>The enemy are now lying near Kennet's Square, and in a tolerably compact body. They have parties advanced on the Lancaster road, and on those leading over this ford and to Wilmington. Manoeuvring appears to be their plan. I hope,

<P>WHEN I had the honor of addressing you this morning, I mentioned that the enemy were advancing, and had begun a cannonade.—I would now beg leave to inform you that they have kept up a brisk fire from their artillery ever since. Their advanced party was attacked by our light troops under general
<PB N="136" REF="031423_0432_0FEC5E3D8A7A9248"/>
Maxwell, who crossed the Brandiwine for that purpose, and had posted his men on some high grounds on each side the road. The fire from our people was not of long duration, as the ene∣my pressed on in force,—but was very severe.</P>
<P>What loss the enemy sustained, cannot be ascertained with precision: but, from our situation, and the briskness of the at∣tack, it is the general opinion, particularly of those who were engaged, that they had at least three hundred men killed and wounded.—Our damage is not exactly known: but, from the best accounts we have been able to obtain, it does not exceed fifty in the whole.</P>
<P>After this affair, the enemy halted upon the heights, where they have remained ever since, except a detachment of them, which filed off about eleven o'clock from their left, and which has since passed Brandiwine at Jones's ford, between five and six miles above Chad's. The amount of it is not known,—the accounts respecting it being various,—some making it two or three thousand strong, and others more.</P>
<P>Generals Sullivan, Stirling, and Stephen, with their divisi∣ons, are gone in pursuit, and to attack it if they can with any prospect of success.—There has been a scattering loose fire be∣tween our parties on each side the creek since the action in the morning, which just now became warm, when general Maxwell passed over with his corps, and drove them from their ground with the loss of thirty men left dead on the spot (among them a captain of the forty-ninth), and a number of intrenching tools with which they were throwing up a battery.</P>
<P>At half after four o'clock, the enemy attacked general Sulli∣van at the ford next above this, and the action has been very violent ever since.—It still continues.—A very severe cannon∣ade has begun here too; and I suppose we shall have a very hot evening:—I hope it will be a happy one.</P>

<P>I AM sorry to inform you, that, in this day's engagement, we have been obliged to leave the enemy masters of the field.—Unfortunately, the intelligence received, of the enemy's ad∣vancing up the Brandiwine and crossing at a ford about six miles above us, was uncertain and contradictory, notwithstanding all my pains to get the best. This prevented me making a dispo∣sition
<PB N="137" REF="031423_0433_0FEC5E3F68573988"/>
adequate to the force with which the enemy attacked us on our right; in consequence of which, the troops first engaged were obliged to retire before they could be reinforced. In the midst of the attack on the right, that body of the enemy, which remained on the other side of Chad's ford, crossed it, and at∣tacked the division there under the command of general Wayne, and the light troops under general Maxwell, who, after a severe conflict, also retired.—The militia under the command of gene∣neral Armstrong being posted at a ford about two miles below Chad's, had no opportunity of engaging.</P>
<P>But, though we fought under many disadvantages, and were, from the causes above mentioned, obliged to retire, yet our loss of men is not, I am persuaded, very considerable,—I be∣lieve, much less then enemy's. We have also lost seven or eight pieces of cannon, according to the best information I can at present obtain.—The baggage, having been previously moved off, is all secure, saving the men's blankets, which being at their backs, many of them doubtless are lost.</P>
<P>I have directed all the troops to assemble behind Chester, where they are now arranging for this night.—Notwithstanding the misfortune of the day, I am happy to find the troops in good spirits: and I hope another time we shall compensate for the losses now sustained.</P>

<P>I HAVE been honored with your favor of this date.—I heartily wish the works on Delaware were completed: but I think,—and in this opinion my officers concur,—that the ser∣vice will be injured if any part of the continental troops were now to be employed about them. If we should be able to op∣pose general Howe with success in the field, the works will be unnecessary;—if not, and he should force us from hence, he will certainly possess himself of them. But, to prevent his at∣tempting it now, I have directed the meadows on Province.
<PB N="138" REF="031423_0434_0FEC5E42236927B0"/>
Island to be overflowed immediately, and any other grounds that may be thought necessary for that purpose.—The works have been more peculiarly under the direction of monsieur Du Coudray, and I doubt not he will pay every attention to their completion and security, that the situation of affairs will admit of.</P>
<P>A part of the militia under general Armstrong will be post∣ed along Schuylkill, to throw up redoubts at the different fords, which will be occasionally occupied, whilst I move to the other side with the main body of the army.—This disposition appears to me the most eligible from a consideration of all circumstan∣ces, and better than if any part of our present force was to be employed at the forts.—If further reinforcements of the militia should come in, they perhaps may be more properly assigned to that business than any we now have.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favor of yesterday, with its several inclosures, came to hand last night.—Though I would willingly pay every attention to the resolutions of Congress, yet, in the late instance respecting the recall of general Sullivan, I must beg leave to defer giving any order about it, till I hear further from that honorable body.—Our situation at this time is critical and de∣licate; and nothing should be done to add to its embarrass∣ments. We are now most probably on the point of another action: and to derange the army by withdrawing so many ge∣neral officers from it, may and must be attended with many dis∣agreeable if not ruinous consequences. Such a proceeding at another time might not produce any bad effects: but how can the army be possibly conducted with a prospect of success, if the general officers are taken off in the moment of battle?—Congress may rely upon it, such a measure will not promote but injure the service.</P>
<P>It is not my wish to prevent or to delay a proper inquiry in∣to general Sullivan's conduct a single instant, when the circum∣stances of the army will admit: but now they prohibit it, and (I think) the suspension in his command also. The recall of general St. Clair obliged me to part with general Lincoln whom I could but ill spare; so that the whole charge of his di∣vision is now upon general Wayne, there being no other briga∣dier in it than himself.—The Maryland troops, if general Sullivan is taken away, will not have one general officer, general Small∣wood being at the head of the militia coming from that state, and general De Borre suspended:—added to this, colonel Gist, who commands one regiment of them, is now from it by order.—In a word, sir, whether the charges alledged against Sullivan are true or false, or whether his conduct has been exceptionable or not, I am satisfied the resolution for his recall at this time was unhappily adopted, and, if carried into execution, will not fail to add new difficulties to our present distresses: and I am obliged to observe, in justice to my own character, that I can∣not be answerable for the consequences which may arise from a want of officers to assist me.</P>
<P>It gives me great pleasure to find general Gates is on so re∣spectable a footing; and I hope our affairs in that quarter, in the course of a little time, will be in as prosperous a train as we could reasonably wish.</P>
<P>The main body of the enemy, from the best intelligence I have been able to get, lies near Dilworthtown, not far from the
<PB N="140" REF="031423_0436_0FEC5E486773B758"/>
field of action, where they have been busily employed in bury∣ing their dead, which, from accounts, amounted to a very consi∣derable number.—We are moving up this road to get between the enemy and the Swedes' ford, and to prevent them from turning our right flank, which they seem to have a violent in∣clination to effect, by all their movements.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to recommend in the most earnest manner, that some board or committee be appointed, or some mode adopted, for obtaining supplies of blankets for the troops:—many are now without; and the season becoming cold, they will be injured in their health, and unfitted for service, unless they are immediately provided with them. Our supplies in this instance, as well as in every article of clothing, cannot be too great, as there are frequent losses not equally to be avoid∣ed.—I would also observe that I think, in point of prudence and sound policy, every species of provisions should be removed from the city, except such as will be necessary to supply the present demands of this army. I have been told there are considerable quantities in private hands, which should not be suffered to remain a moment longer than they can be conveyed away.</P>

<P>Yesterday the enemy moved from Concord, by the Edgemont towards the Lancaster road, with evident design to gain our right flank. This obliged us to alter our position and march to this place, from whence we intend immediately to proceed to War∣wick.—We suffered much from the severe weather yesterday and last night, being unavoidably separated from our tents and baggage,—which not only endangers the health of the men, but has been very injurious to our arms and ammuni∣tion.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not had the honor of addressing you since your adjournment to Lancaster, and I sincerely wish that my first let∣ter was upon a more agreeable subject.—The enemy, by a va∣riety of perplexing manoeuvres through a country from which I could not derive the least intelligence (being to a man disaf∣fected), contrived to pass the Schuylkill last night at the Flat∣land and other fords in the neighborhood of it. They marched immediately towards Philadelphia, and I imagine their advan∣ced parties will be near that city to-night.</P>
<P>They had so far got the start before I received certain intel∣ligence
<PB N="142" REF="031423_0438_0FEC5E53EDC94C58"/>
that any considerable number had crossed, that I found it in vain to think of overtaking their rear, with troops harrass∣ed as ours had been with constant marching since the battle of Brandiwine; and therefore concluded, by the advice of all the general officers, to march from this place to-morrow morn∣ing towards Philadelphia, and on the way endeavor to form a junction with the continental troops under general M'Dougal from Peekskill, and the Jersey militia under general Dickinson, both of whom are, I hope, on this side the Delaware.—I am al∣so obliged to wait for general Wayne and general Smallwood, who were left upon the other side of Schuylkill, in hopes of falling upon the enemy's rear:—but they have eluded them as well as us.</P>
<P>When I last recrossed the Schuylkill, it was with a firm in∣tent of giving the enemy battle wherever I should meet them, and accordingly advanced as far as the Warren tavern upon the Lancaster road, near which place the two armies were upon the point of coming to a general engagement, but were prevented by a most violent flood of rain, which continued all the day and following night. When it held up, we had the mortification to find that our ammunition, which had been com∣pleted to forty rounds a man, was entirely ruined; and in that situation we had nothing left for it but to find out a strong piece of ground which we could easily maintain till we could get the arms put into order, and a recruit of ammuni∣tion.</P>
<P>Before this could be fully effected, the enemy marched from their position near the White-horse tavern, down the road leading to the Swedes' Ford.—I immediately crossed the Schuylkill above them, and threw myself full in their front, hoping to meet them in their passage, or soon after they had passed the river.—The day before yesterday they were again in motion, and marched rapidly up the road leading towards Reading.—This induced me to believe that they had two ob∣jects in view,—one to get round the right of the army,—the other perhaps to detach parties to Reading where we had con∣siderable quantities of military stores.</P>
<P>To frustrate those intentions, I moved the army up on this side the river to this place, determined to keep pace with them: but early this morning I received intelligence that they had crossed the fords below.—Why I did not follow immediately, I have mentioned in the former part of my letter: but the strongest reason against being able to make a forced march is the want of shoes. Messieurs Caroll, Chase, and Penn, who
<PB N="148" REF="031423_0439_0FEC5E55E777BAB0"/>
were some days with the army, can inform Congress in how deplorable a situation the troops are, for want of that necessary article. At least one thousand men are bare-footed, and have performed the marches in that condition. I was told of a great number of shoes in the hands of private people in Philadelphia, and sent down to secure them: but I doubt the approach of the enemy will prevent it.</P>
<P>I have planned a method of throwing a garrison into Fort Mifflin.—If it succeeds, and they, with the assistance of the ships and gallies, should keep the obstructions in the river, ge∣neral Howe's situation in Philadelphia will not be the most a∣greeable: for if his supplies can be stopped by water, it may be easily done by land. To do both shall be my utmost en∣deavor; and I am not yet without hope that the acquisition of Philadelphia may, instead of his good fortune, prove his ruin.</P>
<P>General St. Clair, who has been constantly with the army for some time past, can give you many pieces of information which may have escaped me, and therefore I refer you to him for many particulars.</P>
<P>If there are any shoes and blankets to be had in Lancaster or that part of the country, I earnestly intreat you to have them taken up for the use of the army. I have been informed that there are large parcels of shoes in particular there.</P>
<P>Finding that the inclosed came from colonel Gibson, I took the liberty of opening it, as I wanted much to know what route he was taking.</P>
<P>I have ordered all the Virginia militia who are tolerably armed to come forward and join the army. Those who have no arms are to wait at Frederictown in Maryland till they hear whether any can be provided for them at Lancaster: you will therefore be pleased to make enquiry what number can be pro∣cured there, and send an express to Frederic with orders for as many men to come forward as there are arms.</P>

<P>HAVING received intelligence through two intercepted letters, that general Howe had detached a part of his force for the purpose of reducing Billingsport and the forts on the Dela∣ware, I communicated the accounts to my general officers, who were unanimously of opinion that a favorable opportunity offer∣ed to make an attack upon the troops which were at and near Germantown. It was accordingly agreed that it should take place yesterday morning, and the following dispositions were made.</P>
<P>The divisions of Sullivan and Wayne, flanked by Conway's brigade, were to enter the town by the way of Chesnut-hill, while general Armstrong with the Pennsylvania militia should fall down the Manatawny road by Vandeering's mill, and get upon the enemy's left and rear.—The divisions of Greene and
<PB N="145" REF="031423_0441_0FEC5E5928765660"/>
Stephen, flanked by M'Dougal's brigade, were to enter, by taking a circuit by way of the lime-kiln road, at the market-house, and to attack their right wing; and the militia of Mary∣land and Jersey, under generals Smallwood and Forman, were to march by the old York road, and fall upon the rear of their right. Lord Stirling, with Nash and Maxwell's brigades, was to form a corps-de-reserve.</P>
<P>We marched about seven o'clock the preceding evening, and general Sullivan's advanced party, drawn from Conway's bri∣gade, attacked their piquet at Mount Airy or Mr. Allen's house, about sun-rise the next morning, which presently gave way; and his main body, consisting of the right wing, following soon, en∣gaged the light infantry and other troops encamped near the piquet, which they forced from their ground.—Leaving their baggage, they retreated a considerable distance, having previ∣ously thrown a party into Mr. Chew's house, who were in a si∣tuation not to be easily forced, and had it in their power, from the windows, to give us no small annoyance, and in a great mea∣sure to obstruct our advance.</P>
<P>The attack from our left column under general Greene be∣gan about three-quarters of an hour after that from the right, and was for some time equally successful. But I cannot enter upon the particulars of what happened in that quarter, as I am not yet informed of them with sufficient certainty and precision.</P>
<P>The morning was extremely foggy, which prevented our im∣proving the advantages we gained, so well as we should other∣wise have done. This circumstance, by concealing from us the true situation of the enemy, obliged us to act with more caution and less expedition than we could have wished, and gave the e∣nemy time to recover from the effects of our first impression and, what was still more unfortunate, it served to keep our dif∣ferent parties in ignorance of each other's movements, and hin∣dered their acting in concert. It also occasioned them to mis∣take one another for the enemy,—which, I believe, more than any thing else, contributed to the misfortune which ensued.—In the midst of the most promising appearances, when every thing gave the most flattering hopes of victory, the troops began sud∣denly to retreat, and entirely left the field, in spite of every ef∣fort that could be made to rally them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it may be said the day was rather unfortu∣nate than injurious.—We sustained no material loss of men, and brought off all the artillery, except one piece which was dis∣mounted.—The enemy are nothing the better by the event; and our troops, who are not in the least dispirited by it, have
<PB N="146" REF="031423_0442_0FEC5D73A21762F0"/>
gained what all young troops gain by being in actions. We have had however several valuable officers killed and wounded, particularly the latter. General Nash is among the wounded, and his life is despaired of.—As soon as it is possible to obtain a return of our loss, I will transmit it.</P>
<P>In justice to general Sullivan and the whole right wing of the army, whose conduct I had an opportunity of observing, as they acted immediately under my eye:—I have the pleasure to inform you that both officers and men behaved with a degree of gallantry that did them the highest honor.</P>

<P>P. S. As I have observed, I have not received a return of our loss: but, from what I have just now learned from general Greene. I fear it is more considerable than I at first apprehend∣ed—in men. The cannon, mentioned above, is said to have been brought off in a waggon.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the fifth, I have obtained a return of our loss in the action on saturday, by which it appears to be much more considerable than I at first apprehended, though I always imagined myself that it was greater than it was generally supposed to be. The copy of the return inclosed will shew the amount as it now stands; but I hope many of those who are missing will yet come in: I fear however there are several under that denomination to be added to the number of the slain, as the action was warm in e∣very quarter, from the information of the officers who command∣ed the different attacks.</P>
<P>What loss the enemy sustained, I am not able precisely to as∣certain: but from a variety of corresponding accounts of per∣sons who left the city since, and those of a deserter, it was very considerable. The deserter, who is intelligent, says general Agnew was killed, sir William Erskine wounded in the head and leg, and that their general l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, in killed and wounded a∣mounted to near eight hundred. Several reputable persons from the city corroborate this, particularly with respect to ge∣neral Agnew's death: some say upwards of two hundred wag∣gons with wounded were carried in after the action, and before they came out, and that it was the common belief there, the enemy had been severely handled.</P>
<P>It is with much chagrin and mortification I add, that every
<PB N="147" REF="031423_0443_0FEC5E612E83BED0"/>
account confirms the opinion I at first entertained, that our troops retreated at the instant when victory was declaring her∣self in our favor.—The tumult, disorder, and even despair, which, it seems, had taken place in the British army, were scarcely to be paralleled: and it is said, so strongly did the ideas of a retreat prevail, that Chester was fixed on as their rendez∣vous. I can discover no other cause for not improving this happy opportunity, than the extreme haziness of the weather.</P>
<P>My intention is to encamp the army at some suitable place to rest and refresh the men, and recover them from the still re∣maining effects of that disorder naturally attendant on a retreat. We shall here wait for the reinforcements coming on, and shall then act according to circumstances.—General Varnum, with the detachment from Peekskill amounting to about twelve hun∣dred, including officers, would be last night at Coryel's ferry. About five hundred militia from Virginia, and two hundred from Maryland, together with colonel Gibson's state regiment con∣sisting of two hundred and twenty-six effectives, have already joined the army.—Since the action, general Forman's brigade of Jersey militia has quitted us. The men began to be uneasy at their situation, and desirous to return home: and as, by some intelligence received from general Dickinson, there was reason to imagine there might be a call for their services in the Jer∣seys, it was thought expedient to gratify their desire.</P>
<P>The state of our water defence on the Delaware is far from being as flattering as could be wished. After some slight oppo∣sition from the Jersey militia under general Newcomb, a de∣tachment of the enemy took possession of Billingsport. This perhaps is an event of no material consequence: but it is to be lamented that many of the officers and seamen on board the gal∣lies have manifested a disposition that does them little honor. Looking upon their situation as desperate, or probably from worse motives, they have been guilty of the most alarming de∣sertions: two whole crews, including the officers, have deserted to the enemy. I learn however by captain Brewer, who is this moment arrived here from the fleet, that the accounts they have received from the city, of our late attack, were such as to have produced a favorable change, and to have inspired them with more confidence.—I would here observe, that the charge of bad conduct was by no means applicable to the whole:—far from it.—He further adds that four of the enemy's ships made an attempt yesterday morning to weigh the chevaux-de-frise op∣posite to Billingsport, but were repulsed by our gallies,—which has also contributed to raise the spirits of the seamen. Our
<PB N="148" REF="031423_0444_0FEC5E65C259F590"/>
garrison on Fort-Island, consisting of little more than two hun∣dred continental troops under lieutenant-colonel Smith, appear determined to maintain their posts to the last extremity.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congress that there is a great defi∣ciency of general officers to command this army. When the detachment coming from Peekskill joins us, we shall have thir∣teen brigades. These require as many brigadiers, and six major-generals.—instead of these, we shall have only four major-gene∣rals and six brigadiers; and the deficiency will be still increas∣ed by the death of general Nash, which, from every appearance, is momently to be expected. General Woodford's absence, oc∣casioned by his wound, adds to our embarrassments, though it will be but for a time. Under these circumstances, Congress will be sensible that the government of the army cannot go on with that energy which is essential to its well-being and success. Neither officers nor men will transfer the respect and obedience they pay to a general officer, to a colonel who happens to be appointed to the temporary command of a brigade; nor will he, knowing his authority to be only temporary, be as solicit∣ous to inforce it as one who is conscious he is to continue in the station he fills. Want of leisure prevents my being more parti∣cular at this time: but I shall take the liberty, in a day or two, to point out the troops that are in want of general officers, with my observations on the subject.</P>
<P>I cannot however omit this opportunity of recommending ge∣neral M'Dougal to their notice. This gentleman, from the time of his appointment as brigadier,—from his abilities, mili∣tary knowledge, and approved bravery,—has every claim to promotion. If I mistake not, he was passed over in the last ap∣pointment of major-generals, and younger officers preferred be∣fore him: but his disinterested attachment to the service pre∣vented his acting in the manner that is customary in like cir∣cumstances. This, I think, gives him a peculiar title to esteem, and concurs with the opinion I have of his value as an officer, to make me wish it may appear advisable to Congress to pro∣mote him to one of the vacancies.</P>
<P>It would be well if the intended inquiry into the conduct of general St. Clair could be brought to a speedy issue; and, if he is acquitted to the satisfaction of Congress, that, as his general character as an officer is good, he may be again restored to the service.</P>
<P>By a letter this evening received from colonel Hawkes Hay of Haverstraw, dated the fifth at four o'clock P. M. four ships of war, a considerable number of armed vessels, eight transports,
<PB N="149" REF="031423_0445_0FEF8BA541317B20"/>
and forty flat-bottomed boats, arrived that morning in the bay opposite that place, and were landing troops at Verplank's-Point.—Their number and design were not known.</P>

<P>AS general Howe's operations are in this quarter, and his object in all probability fixed for this campaign, I am induc∣ed to submit it to the consideration of Congress if the whole or a part of the regiment of artillery commanded by colonel Har∣rison should not be immediately ordered to join this army. In the late actions, the corps under general Knox has suffered se∣verely; and it is so reduced by the number of killed, wounded, &amp;c. that we are obliged to make draughts from the other bat∣talions to supply their places. The measure I have ventured to submit will not, from present appearances, be attended with any ill consequences, if carried into execution,—and the less so, as the state of Virginia, according to my information, is raising another regiment. Should it be thought advisable. Congress will transmit their orders to colonel Harrison.—If the regiment comes, they need not bring their artillery.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON wednesday evening I received the honor of your letter of the seventh with it several inclosures.—The providing of suitable quarters for the troops during the winter demands our attention: but I confess it is difficult to say where they will be. Sundry circumstances may occur in the course of the campaign, to render any provision, which might now be thought of, alto∣gether improper.</P>
<P>In respect to general Putnam's letter, though the accounts transmitted by colonel Hawkes Hay indicate that the enemy
<PB N="150" REF="031423_0446_0FEC5E68380A1990"/>
had some attack in contemplation, yet I cannot but think the force the general mentions to have been at New-York was greatly exaggerated. The highest number of the reinforce∣ments, said to have arrived, is three thousand; and these are mentioned to be half boys. Other reports make it much less,—and some as low as five or six hundred.—However, be it what it may, it is not in my power to grant him aid.—Had the rein∣forcement arrived before the troops marched from Peekskill, so many might not have been ordered from thence. But the case was otherwise, or at least I was not apprised of their arri∣val; and the detachments from thence were directed by the advice of my general officers, who had under consideration the state of the whole force at that post and its dependencies, ac∣cording to a general return. At the same time I urged general Putnam to call in all his out-posts, and to write in pressing terms to governor Trumbull to assist him with some militia.</P>
<P>I have not heard a single syllable more of the troops or fleet mentioned by colonel Hawkes Hay, except a vague report to∣day that a number, supposed to be about fifteen hundred, had landed on this side the river at Haverstraw.—If the fact is so, it is probable they mean to pass through the Clove and invest the forts.—I have great confidence in the activity and bravery of governor Clinton; and I trust, if such is their view, they will meet at least with a spirited if not a successful opposition.—I have sent up lieutenant-colonel Radire, one of the engi∣neers, with orders to direct such other works as may appear necessary.</P>
<P>There was a very severe cannonade on wednesday night: i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> began about twelve o'clock, and continued till yesterday morning between seven and eight. I have not learned the occasion; but, from the direction, suppose it was at Fort-Mifflin, or an engagement between our armed vessels and the enemy's ships, which probably were making a second attempt against the che∣vaux-de-frise.—I have determined to maintain the post at Red-bank, if it can be done, and have detached colonel Greene there with his regiment of Rhode-Island troops, consisting of about two hundred and twelve effective privates. I have also written to general Newcomb of Jersey, pressing him to give all the aid he can from the militia.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the seventh we have been joined by more of the Virginia militia.—The whole number now in camp a∣mounts to about eleven hundred. Many of their arms are in∣different, and almost the whole are destitute of pouches and other necessary accoutrements.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="031423_0447_0FEC5E7257100998"/>
On sunday the enemy evacuated Billingsport.—They left all our cannon, but burned the platforms and carriages.</P>
<P>Inclosed you will receive a letter addressed to me by colonel Portail. Congress will judge of the contents, and decide upon them as they may think they merit.</P>
<P>The military chest is nearly exhausted, not having more than ten thousand dollars in it; and a large part of the army is to pay for the month of August. Besides their claims, large sums are wanted by the quarter-master general, and for other pur∣poses.—Congress, I hope, will order such immediate supply to be forwarded to the paymaster-general, as shall be in their power.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 11.—I wish to know what stores of lead we have, and what expectations of further supplies. I am rather uneasy on this head, as I have not been able to obtain satisfaction on some inquiries within the course of a few days.</P>
<P>The cannonade mentioned above was between our gallies and a detachment of the enemy who were attempting to throw up a battery at Webb's or the lowest ferry on Schuylkill. It has been repeated this morning.—Their design, in erecting this battery, probably is to cover their passage to Province-Island, from whence, by occupying the grounds about the pest-houses, they may expect to annoy Fort-Mifflin.</P>
<P>Our distress for want of shoes and stockings is amazingly great, particularly for want of the former. On this account we have a great many men who cannot do duty, and several detained at the hospitals for no other cause.—I must request Congress to continue their exertions to relieve us, and to direct every supply of these and other necessaries to be forwarded as soon as they possibly can after they are collected. It will be proper to send them on as fast as they can be procured, without waiting to make up a considerable quantity to be brought at one time.</P>
<P>I was this morning honored with your favors of the ninth, and their several inclosures.—I feel in the most sensible manner the honorable approbation Congress have been pleased to give of my conduct, and that of the army under my command, in the action on the fourth instant: nor am I less indebted to you, sir, for the polite mode in which you have conveyed their sen∣timents.—I shall communicate the resolve upon the subject to the army, and hope, if a favorable opportunity offers, under the smiles of providence, they will merit, by more substantial ser∣vices, the further applause of their country.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="031423_0448_0FEC5E746EA04F50"/>
The resolution of the eighth, for preventing supplies and in∣telligence being carried to the enemy, appears to me to be a sa∣lutary one; and I hope it will be attended with the most bene∣ficial consequences. That it may be known among the inha∣bitants who are in their neighborhood, and who have been guilty of such practices, I would wish to receive several printed copies, that they may be distributed in proper places.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the eleventh instant, nothing material has happened between our army and general Howe's.—The inclosed copies of commodore. Hazle∣wood and colonel Bradford's letters will shew the situation of affairs in the navy and at Fort-Mifflin, on the eleventh,—which are the latest accounts I have received from thence. But there has been a warm cannonade ever since, which continued, with but little intermission, till between two and three o'clock yes∣terday afternoon, when it ceased. The result I have not heard; but I hope, from the determined spirit of the fleet and the gar∣rison, matters continue as we could wish.</P>
<P>I received an express last night from general Putnam, in∣forming me of the capture of Fort-Montgomery, and the con∣sequent evacuation of Peekskill. I should send copies of his letters to me: but as the express who brought them had dis∣patches for Congress, I conclude he has advised them fully on the subject.—These events may have an unhappy influence on our northern affairs: but as the Connecticut militia seem to be coming in fast, and governor Clinton is exerting himself to bring out the force of New-York,—if general Putnam can but keep pace with their fleet in their progress up the river, I hope he will be able to frustrate their design of relieving general Burgoyne, and that every thing will still terminate well in that quarter.</P>
<P>It gives me pain to repeat so often the wants of the army: and nothing would induce me to it but the most urgent necessi∣ty. Every mode hitherto adopted for supplying them has pro∣ved inadequate, notwithstanding my best endeavors to make the most of the means which have been in my power.—The inclo∣sed return will shew how great our deficiency in the most es∣sential
<PB N="153" REF="031423_0449_0FEC5E76032AC2B0"/>
articles.—What new expedient Congress can devise for more effectually answering these demands, I know not, persuad∣ed as I am that their closest attention has not been wanting to a matter of so great importance: but, circumstanced as we are, I am under an absolute necessity of troubling them, that if any new source can be opened for alleviating our distresses, it may be embraced as speedily as possible; for it is impossible that any army, so unprovided, can long subsist, or act with that vigor which is requisite to ensure success.</P>
<P>The return now inclosed is for troops present in camp,—be∣sides which, there are numbers in the several hospitals, totally destitute of the necessaries they require to sit them for the field; and, on this account alone, are prevented from joining their corps. The recruits coming in are also in the same me∣lancholy predicament.—I cannot ascertain with precision what quantity of clothing is at this time in Mr. Mease's hands: but, from every account, what he has can administer but a very par∣tial relief.—I know he is entirely bare of some of the most ca∣pital articles we want.</P>
<P>With respect to cartouch-boxes, without which it is impossi∣ble to act, I cannot find from my inquiries that there are any in store. Several of the continental troops are deficient in this instance; and, what adds to our distress, there are but very few of the southern militia that are provided.—I am trying to make a collection about the country: but, from the information I have received, the measure will be attended with but litle suc∣cess.—This want, though not remedied immediately, may be removed in time; and I would take the liberty to recommend that the earliest attention should be had to making a large sup∣ply. I would also advise that much care should be use in chus∣ing the leather:—none but the best and thickest is proper for the purpose; and each box should have a small inner flap for the greater security of the cartridges against the rain and moist weather. The flaps in general are too small, and do not pro∣ject sufficiently over the ends or sides of the boxes.—I am con∣vinced of the utility, nay necessity, of these improvements, and that the adoption of them, though they will incur an additional expense at first, will prove a considerable saving, and of the most beneficial consequences: for we know from unhappy ex∣perience in the severe rain on the sixteenth ultimo, the few boxes we had of this construction preserved the ammunition without injury, whilst it was almost wholly destroyed in those of the common form with a single flap.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which I cannot omit mentioning to
<PB N="154" REF="031423_0450_0FEC5E780013B2F8"/>
Congress, and which, in my opinion, has a claim to their most serious attention,—I mean the general defective state of the regiments which compose our armies.—Congress will find, from a view of the returns transmitted from time to time, that they do not amount to half of their just complement. What can be done to remedy this, I know not: but it is certain every idea of voluntary enlistments seems to be at an end; and it is equal∣ly certain that the mode of draughting has been carried on with such want of energy in some states, and so much disregard∣ed in others, that but a small accession of force has been deriv∣ed from it. These facts are sufficiently interesting of them∣selves.—But there are others to be added.—I am told that Virginia, in her regulations for draughting, extended her plan only to the nine regiments that were first raised. In what po∣licy this was founded, I cannot determine: but the other six are to receive no reinforcements from that source.—Nor do matters stop here. The engagements of the first nine regi∣ments, I am informed, were temporary; and, according to the officers' accounts, the longest period to which any of the men are bound to serve is next April:—many are not obliged so long; and there are some who claim a discharge at this time.—I do not mention these things through choice, but from a prin∣ciple of duty, to the end that Congress may devise some timely and effectual provision for the whole, if such shall be in their power.—It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the subject; and I will only observe that the consequences of calling the militia [<HI>into the field in</HI>] the course of the war have been so severely and ruinously felt, that I trust our views will never be turned to them but in cases of the greatest extremity.</P>
<P>In pursuance of the resolution of Congress, a court of in∣quiry has sat upon general Sullivan. They met on the tenth, and continued the examination till the twelfth, when they came to the inclosed opinion.—The depositions and papers which were before the court were many and prolix. They are not transmitted: but they may be obtained from the court, if want∣ed.—Besides the depository proofs which they had of wounded and dead officers, they had many gentlemen before them in person.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the twelfth and thirteenth instant, with their several inclosures.—In respect to the resolution directing a flag to be sent to gene∣ral Howe, I am inclined to think that the information upon which it was framed was without foundation. The letters which have come from our officers who have been lately taken gene∣rally mention that their treatment has been tolerably good; and such privates as have escaped have said nothing in the course of their examination of their having been compelled to work.—For these reasons I have taken the liberty to decline sending the flag. At the same time Congress may be assured, if our prisoners suffer any wrongs, I shall take every means in my power to have them redressed as soon as I am apprised of them.</P>
<P>It is with the highest satisfaction I congratulate Congress on the success of our arms at the northward in the action of the seventh,—an event of the most interesting importance at this critical juncture. From the happy train in which things then were, I hope we shall soon hear of the most decisive advan∣tages.</P>
<P>We moved this morning from the encampment at which we had been for six or seven days past, and are just arrived at the grounds we occupied before the action of the fourth. One mo∣tive for coming here is to divert the enemy's attention and force from the forts. These they seem to consider as capital objects, and (from their operations) mean to reduce, if possible.—At present their designs are directed against Fort-Mifflin and the chevaux-de-frise. I have therefore detached a further rein∣forcement to the garrison.</P>
<P>I yesterday, through the hands of Mrs. * * *, received a let∣ter of a very curious and extraordinary nature from Mr. D* * *, which I have thought proper to transmit to Congress. To this ridiculous, illiberal performance, I made a short reply, by de∣siring the bearer of it, if she should hereafter by any accident meet with Mr. D* * *, to tell him I should have returned it unopened, if I had any idea of the contents;—observing at

the same time, that I highly disapproved the intercourse she seemed to have been carrying on, and expected it would be dis∣continued.—Notwithstanding the author's assertion, I cannot but suspect that the measure did not originate with him; and that he was induced to it by the hope of establishing his inter∣est and peace more effectually with the enemy.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night had the honor to receive your letter of the seventeenth instant, with its several inclosures.</P>
<P>I heartily wish the states may feel the importance of filling their battalions, and may, in consequence of the recommenda∣tion of Congress, adopt such measures as will prove effectual for the purpose. I cannot but think that heretofore there has been a want of attention in this instance, and that the subject, though interesting to the last degree, has been viewed with too much indifference. The resolutions respecting desert∣ers, I hope, will also have their notice. It is highly necessary that they should come into some regulations for apprehending them, and punishing those who give them countenance. If this is not done, our force will be always diminishing, and no exer∣tions in the army will prevent it. I shall try the effects of a proclamation on those who are now delinquents, and shall be happy if it meets with success; but confess, from the experi∣ment I have made, that I am not sanguine in my expectations that it will be the case.</P>
<P>As to the recruiting officers, I must observe, that, notwith∣standing the resolution of Congress of the thirty-first of July, and my circular letter on the subject of it to many of the states, I have not received an account that any officers have been ap∣pointed, except in Connecticut and Jersey.</P>
<P>On sunday the enemy evacuated Germantown, and withdrew themselves within their lines near the city. They seem deter∣mined to reduce the forts, if possible; and, for this purpose, have thrown several parties over on Province-Island. I was informed this afternoon that a detachment also passed the Dela∣ware at Cooper's ferry in the morning. If the account be true (and I have no doubt of it) it is highly probable they mean to make an attack upon the garrison at Red-bank. I am taking
<PB N="157" REF="031423_0453_0FEC5E86C0FB7AE8"/>
every measure in my power to counteract them, and have writ∣ten to generals Forman and Newcomb of Jersey to afford every aid they can to relieve the fort, in case they do invest it.</P>
<P>Against Fort-Mifflin they have kept up a cannonade, more or less every day, and have thrown several shells, but without do∣ing any considerable damage. The explosion of one killed a private, and wounded three others, who were in a barrack where it fell. They also set fire to two ammunition-boxes with a hot ball on the nineteenth, which did some injury to the barracks. I do not recollect that we have suffered lately in any instances besides these.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honor of transmitting to Congress the inclosed copies of sundry letters just now received, and congra∣tulate them most sincerely on the important intelligence which they contain.—The damage the enemy have sustained in their ships, I hope, will prevent their future attempts to gain the pas∣sage of the river; and the repulse of the troops under count Donnop, and his captivity, I flatter myself, will also be attend∣ed with the most happy consequences. At the time these ac∣tions happened, a supply of ammunition was on the way to the forts; and I have also ordered a further quantity to be immedi∣ately sent.</P>
<P>By colonel Blaine, one of the issuing commissaries, who left Red-bank in the morning before the action, I am happily in∣formed that he had thrown considerable supplies of provision into both garrisons. He also adds that he came from Jersey this morning, and that the enemy had recrossed the Delaware and returned to Philadelphia. I have written to colonel Greene that the prisoners must be immediately sent from his post: and Mr. Clymer, a deputy under Mr. Boudinot, will set out to∣morrow morning to make a proper disposition of them.</P>
<P>It gives me great concern to inform Congress, that, after all my exertions, we are still in a distressed situation for want of blankets and shoes. At this time no inconsiderable part of our force are incapable of acting, through the deficiency on the lat∣ter: and I fear, without we can be relieved, it will be the case with two-thirds of the army in the course of a few days.</P>
<P>I am and have been waiting with the most anxious impatience for a confirmation of general Burgoyne's surrender. I have re∣ceived
<PB N="158" REF="031423_0454_0FEC5E8856A4B120"/>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS duly honored with Mr. Hancock's letter of the twenty-fifth, with its several inclosures.—I shall take the case of John More under consideration; and will transmit colonel Mason my determination upon the same.</P>
<P>At this time I cannot inform the commissary whether any al∣terations have or have not been made by general orders in the original ration establishment. I have been under the necessity, from time to time, to send away my orderly books; and they are necessary to be examined on the subject. However, I think it probable that a departure from the first allowance may have been found expedient, and directed by some authority,—or the commissary would not have adopted it.—In respect to the al∣teration referred to my consideration, it is a matter of conse∣quence, and I have desired the general officers to inform them∣selves whether it will be agreeable to the army at large, or what other regulations may be necessary in this instance.—As soon as I have their sentiments, I will write to Congress upon the subject.</P>
<P>The enemy still consider the possession of our posts upon the river of great importance; and, from their preparations of fa∣scines, &amp;c. and the best information I have been able to obtain, they will make further efforts to carry them.—Viewing them in this light myself, and imagining that they would persevere in their plans to occupy them, I wrote some days ago in the most pressing terms to generals Dickinson, Forman, and * * *, to af∣ford every aid in their power from the militia of New-Jersey. As yet we have received but little; and I have no encourage∣ment to expect that it will be much augmented in a short time. This does not proceed from a want of activity and exertion on the part of the two first-mentioned gentlemen, whose conduct and zea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon every occasion give them a claim to the public esteem, but in a considerable degree to the peculiar circumstan∣ces of their state at this time. The apprehensions of an inva∣sion
<PB N="159" REF="031423_0455_0FEC5E8A1F501918"/>
from Staten-Island keep a large proportion of the militia from the eastern and upper part of the state almost, constantly employed at and in the neighborhood of Elizabethtown, and Mr. Livingston's powers, as governor, being expired,—and no provision made (it seems) for such a contingency,—there are none of sufficient authority to order them out, till a new ap∣pointment can be had:—at least there is ground to suspect that the orders and exertions of these two gentlemen, unassisted by civil authority, will not be attended with the advantages we wish, and which our affairs require. * * *</P>
<P>Under these circumstances I have been obliged to detach a further reinforcement of continental troops under general Var∣num, to maintain the two garrisons, if possible,—besides sailors drawn from the line, to man the gallies. This detachment, when it arrives, added to the force now in the forts, will make the whole amount to sixteen hundred effective rank and file sent from this army.</P>
<P>After the action of the fourth ultimo at Germantown, I hop∣ed we should have been in a situation to attack the enemy again on those grounds, and with more success than in the former in∣stance: but this I was not able to effect. The severe rain on the sixteenth of September,—the action on the fourth,—the re∣moval of our stores, and having to form a new elaboratory,—added to the small number of hands engaged in the business of it,—laid us under difficulties in the capital and essential article of ammunition, that could not be surmounted. Every exertion was directed to obtain supplies; but (notwithstanding) they were inadequate, too scanty, and insufficient to attempt any thing on a large and general scale, before the enemy withdrew themselves. With what we had, in case an experiment had been made, fortune might have decided in our favor for the pre∣sent; but we should not have been afterwards in a situation to maintain the advantage we might have gained: and if a repulse had taken place, and the enemy pursued,—for want of a reserve, we might have been exposed to the most imminent danger of being ruined.—The distress of the soldiers for want of shoes was also a powerful obstacle to the measure.</P>
<P>I could wish that our circumstances were now such as to au∣thorise a general attack for dislodging them from the city: but I think that they are not. This also is the opinion of my general officers, upon a full and comprehensive view of matters, as Con∣gress will perceive by the inclosed copy of the minutes of coun∣cil on the twenty-ninth ultimo, which I have taken the liberty to transmit and lay before them.—The superiority of numbers
<PB N="160" REF="031423_0456_0FEC5E8C0C2E8F90"/>
the part of the enemy, in respect to regular troops,—their su∣perior discipline, and the redoubts and lines which they have thrown up between the two rivers and about the city,—the happy state of our affairs at the northward, and the practicabi∣lity of drawing succours from thence, the consequences of a defeat,—these were all motives which led to a decision against an attack at this time.</P>
<P>I have sent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides to general Gates, to give him a just representation of things, and to ex∣plain to him the expediency of our receiving the reinforce∣ments which have been determined necessary, if they will not interfere with and frustrate any important plans he may have formed. Indeed I cannot conceive that there is any object now remaining, that demands our attention and most vigorous efforts so much as the destruction of the army in this quarter. Should we be able to effect this, we shall have little to fear in future.</P>
<P>General Howe's force, according to the state now made, is more considerable than it was generally supposed to be. I did not think it quite so great myself, but always imagined the common estimate much too low:—nor can I positively say what it really is. However, there are strong reasons to believe that it is not over-rated. After the evacuation of Germantown, an almost infinite number of scraps and bits of paper were found, which, being separated and arranged with great industry and care, bear the marks of genuine and authentic returns at dif∣ferent periods. The manner in which they were destroyed and disposed of gives no room to suspect that it was the effect of de∣sign.—In addition to this, I am informed by general Putnam that he had heard a reinforcement of four regiments was com∣ing round to Delaware from New-York.</P>
<P>The inclosed return will give Congress a general view of the strength of this army when it was made, and a particular one of the forces of each state which compose it. By this they will perceive how greatly deficient the whole are in furnishing their just quotas.—The militia from Maryland and Virginia are no longer to be counted on:—all the former, except about two hundred, are already gone; and a few days, I expect, will produce the departure of the whole or chief part of the latter, from the importunate applications which some of them have made. Besides this diminution, I am apprehensive we shall have several men added to the sick list by reason of the late excessive rain and want of clothes.</P>
<P>We have not yet come to any determination respecting the
<PB N="161" REF="031423_0457_0FEC5D93AB1071D0"/>
disposition of our troops for the winter,—supposing it a matter of great importance, and that for the present we should be si∣lent upon it. The reasons will readily occur. By continuing the campaign, perhaps many salutary if not decisive advantages may be derived; but it appears to me that this must depend upon the supplies of clothing which the men receive. If they cannot be accommodated in this instance, it will be difficult if not impossible to do it without effecting their destruction.</P>
<P>I would take the liberty to mention that I feel myself in a delicate situation with respect to the marquis La Fayette.—He is extremely solicitous of having a command equal to his rank, and professes very different ideas, as to the purposes of his appointment, from those Congress have mentioned to me:—he certainly did not understand them.—I do not know in what light they will view the matter: but it appears to me, from a consideration of his illustrious and importortant connections,—the attachment which he has manifested for our cause,—and the consequences which his return in disgust might produce,—that it will be advisable to gratify him in his wishes; and the more so, as several gentlemen from France, who came over un∣der some assurances, have gone back disappointed in their ex∣pectations.—His conduct with respect to them stands in a favor∣able point of view,—having interested himself to remove their uneasiness, and urged the impropriety of their making any unfa∣vorable representations upon their arrivil at home: and in all his letters, he has placed our affairs in the best situation he could.—Besides, he is sensible, discreet in his manners, has made great proficiency in our language, and, from the disposition he discovered at the battle of Brandiwine, possesses a large share of bravery and military ardor.</P>
<P>There is a French gentleman here,—monsieur Vrigny,—in whose favor the marquis seems much interested. He assures me he is an officer of great merit, and, from that motive and a regard to the service, wishes to see him promoted. The rank he holds in France, and his present expectations, are contained in the inclosed copy of a paper given me by the marquis, Mon∣sieur Vrigny also has honorable certificates of his services, near∣ly corresponding with the maquis's account of them.—If Con∣gress are pleased to honor him with a commission in the army of the states, I must try to employ him.</P>
<P>I took the liberty some short time ago to mention to Con∣gress the situation of the nine first-raised Virginia regiments, and the term for which they stand engaged; and; considering that we should suffer greatly by the loss of so large a part of
<PB N="162" REF="031423_0458_0FEC5E90233B5538"/>
our force which have been long inured to service, I thought it advisable to consult the officers commanding them, upon the mode which should appear to them best calculated to re-enlist them. They accordingly met, and reported their sentiments in writing, a copy of which I have enclosed.—I do not know that expedients, more promising of success than those they have pointed out, can be adopted.—Congress will be pleased to give the matter their earliest attention, and to favor me with their opinion by the first opportunity, whether the indulgence and allowance they have proposed may be granted.—and, if any additional bounty may be given, what it shall be.—The high sums paid for substitutes and draughts, of late, even in the mi∣litia service, will make this necessary: for the soldiers, being well app rised of that fact, will not be induced to engage again during the war or for three years, for the usual premium.</P>
<P>I would also lay before Congress a remonstrance by the sub∣altern officers of the Virginia line, founded on a reform I thought necessary to take place in the regiments from that state. These, in their establishment, were made to consist of ten companies,—two more than were assigned to those of the states in general. This, and the great disproportion between the officers and men, induced me to reduce them to a level with the rest belonging to the continent, in order to prevent, a considerable unnecessary expense.—To effect this, no new promotions are to be made in the two extra companies, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the ninth and tenth, either to vacancies existing at the time of the regulation, or to any fu∣ture ones that may happen therin: and the subalterns are to remain in their rank and command, till they can be promoted in the other eight companies, and their men incorporated.—This is what they complain of.—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have made a short state of facts, and wish Congress to determine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and the re∣monstrance as they shall think proper.</P>
<P>At the request of governor Clinton I have transmitted a co∣py of his letter to me, giving an account of general Vaughan's expedition up the North-river after the capture of Fort-Mont∣gomery, and the destruction committed by his troops in burning Kingston and the houses and mills on the river.—According to the latest advices, they have returned again; and it is reported that they have destroyed the barracks and forts, and gone to New-York:—but this is not confirmed.</P>
<P>A few days ago, Mr. Franks of Philadelphia, agent for the British prisoners, sent out six thousand continental dollars to Mr. Richard Graham of Virginia, for the subsistence of the Hessian and other prisoners in that state. The policy of suf∣fering
<PB N="163" REF="031423_0459_0FEC5E95743E09E8"/>
the enemy to support their prisoners with money which they refuse themselves, and which they attempt to depreciate in every instance they possibly can, appears to me very questi∣onable,—and the more so, as it may be counterfeited.—Besides, they have laid us under every difficulty they can devise, as to our prisoners in their hands:—nothing will do for their support but hard money.—If the enemy were obliged to furnish the same, the quanity with us would be greater, and of course the means of relieving ours, easier. I do not know what conse∣quences a prohibition against receiving continental money or the currency of any state from them might involve: I think the subject is worthy of the consideration of Congress; and for that reason I have mentioned it.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 3.—The report of the enemy's having destroyed the forts and barracks on the North-river, and of their having returned to New-York, is confirmed. I this morning received a letter from general Putnam upon the subject, a copy of which is transmitted.—The information that they mean to reinforce general Howe, I doubt not, is true: it has come through seve∣ral channels, and nothing is more probable.—As to their hav∣ing a further expedition in view, it seems to be questionable:—general Burgoyne's defeat, and the eastern troops being ready to be employed in another way, are circumstances against the measure.</P>
<P>Agreeable to my expectation, the Virginia militia are gone: so that we have none now in aid of the continental troops, but those of this state mentioned in the return, and a few from Ma∣ryland. I do not know what can or will be done to obtain further reinforcements of them: but it appears to me, taking matters in any point of light, that further aids should come from Virginia and Maryland: for, should we be able to accom∣modate the continental forces with clothes so as to carry on a winter campaign, their assistance will be material, either to maintain a blockade, or in any decisive stroke we may attempt. And if they cannot be so provided, and we should be obliged to retire into quarters, their service will be still more necessary to assist in covering the country against incursions for forage and provisions. The militia of this state, themselves, supposing they should be tolerably vigorous in their exertions, will not be equal to the task: at least it will be difficult, if not imprac∣ticable, for them to do it. It is to be wished that such as can be drawn out may be engaged to serve three months, or two at least (if it can be effected), after their arrival in camp; and that a mode could be adopted to supply their places with others
<PB N="164" REF="031423_0460_0FEC5E9C05EC4FC8"/>
at the expiration of their term, should the exigency of our af∣fairs require it. A time for their continuance should be fix∣ed, or they will always be uneasy and pushing off; and the longer circumstances will admit it to be, the better: for, after the period recurs, for which they come. it will be impossible to retain, them a moment. As to the number that should be required, it is difficult to determine: however, it is likely it will fall short of the requisition, as it ever has upon such oc∣casions.</P>
<P>There is a report prevailing in camp, which has come through several channels, that a successful expedition has been made upon Rhode-Island, and eight hundred prisoners taken, with several pieces of artillery, and a large quantity of salt.—I heartily wish it may be true: but at present it wants confir∣mation</P>
<P>Mr. Thompson's letter of the twenty-first ultimo, with its inclosures, came to hand yesterday. I join Congress most sin∣cerely in congratulations on our important success in the sur∣render of general Burgoyne at the head of his forces, and am happy they have received a confirmation of the event from gene∣ral Gates.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honor to inclose you an extract a letter from major-general Dickinson, of the sixth instant, by which it appears that a reinforcement has sailed from New-York, ei∣ther from general Howe or some other expedition. I have not yet head whether any of the troops on their march from the northward have yet crossed the North-river: but I hope they will be with me near as soon as general Howe's reinforcement can arrive at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>There was a heavy firing of cannon all the day of the fifth, down the river; and in the evening some musketry was heard; from whence we concluded that an attack had been made upon Fort-Mifflin. But it turned out to be an attack made by ge∣neral Varnum, with a twelve and an eighteen-pounder fixed near Red-bank, upon the enemy's ships. He thinks he damag∣ed the Somerset of sixty-four guns considerably, as she got on ground, and was for some time exposed to his fire. The ships were obliged to quit their stations and fall lower down.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="031423_0461_0FEC5D6C21A2A438"/>
From a variety of accounts and circumstances, I am induced to believe that the enemy are miditating a grand blow against Fort-Mifflin. I have put the place in as good a state of defence as my present numbers will admit, and have directed general Varnum to afford every further assistance in his power. I therefore hope they will meet a warm reception whenever they make the attempt.</P>
<P>The military chest is again empty, and the army is unpaid for the months of September and October,—besides the draughts that are requisite for the commissary and quarter-master-gene∣ral's department. You will therefore be pleased to direct a supply of cash to be sent on as expediously as possible.</P>
<P>I fear, from a letter which I have lately received from ge∣neral Heath, that no proper measures are taken to put up a supply of salt provisions for next campaign, to the eastward. I have inclosed a copy of general Heath's letter to Mr. Bu∣chanan, the commissary-general of purchases, and have desired him to have the matter looked into in time: but is of so much importance to the very existence of the army, that I think it deserves the attention of Congress.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the fourth and fifth instant, with their several inclosures. Among those of the former, I found the resolution you are pleased to allude to, respecting your appointment as president. ▪Permit me, sir, to congratulate you upon this event, and to assure you I have the most entire confidence that I shall experience in you during your presidency the same politeness, and attention to the interests of the states, that marked the conduct of your worthy predecessor.</P>
<P>With respect to the views of the navy-board for securing the frigates, the situation of the army would not admit of a com∣pliance with them, supposing they would answer the end. I have therefore written to te board in the most pressing terms, to have the frigates scuttled in such way that they may be rais∣ed when it shall be necessary, and that in the mean time they may not be liable to injury from floating ice.—I see no mea∣sure so likely to secure them to us, and against the enemy's at∣tempts.—
<PB N="166" REF="031423_0462_0FEC5EA149FB5FC8"/>
I have been extremely fearful they would have pos∣sessed and employed them, with the Delaware and their batte∣ries, on the rear of the gallies and the fort, while the ships be∣low attacked in front. I need not point out the probable con∣sequences of such an event: they are too obvious.</P>
<P>The resolves which you request to be communicated to the ar∣my shall be published in general orders.—The letters for com∣modore Hazlewood, &amp;c. have been put in a proper channel of conveyance.</P>
<P>As to the disposition of part of the northern army, my letter of the first, continued to the third, contains my ideas upon the subject, and those my general officers. I shall be sorry if the measures I have taken on this head should interfere with or materially vary from any plans Congress might have had in view. Their proceedings of the fifth, I presume, were founded on a supposition that the enemy were still up the North-river, and garrisoning the forts they had taken.—This not being the case, and all accounts agreeing that reinforcements to general Howe are coming from York, I hope the aides I have requir∣ed will be considered expedient and proper. Independent of the latter consideration, I think our exertions and force should be directed to effect general Howe's destruction if it is possible.</P>
<P>Among the various difficulties attenting the army the adjust∣ment of rank is not the least. This,—owing to the several modes, the severel principles, that have prevailed in granting commissions,—is involving in great perplexity. The officers of the Pennsylvania troops are in much confusion about it: in many instances, those who were junior in rank, from local and other circumstances, have obtained commissions older in date than those which were granted afterwards to officers, their su∣periors before. This, with many other irregularies, has been and is the cause of great uneasiness: and, though precedency of rank so claimed should not be supported in justice or upon any principle,—we find all, having the least pretext for the title, strenuous to support it, and willing to hold a superiority. I was therefore induced to order a board of officers to take the matter under consideration. The result, respecting the field-officers of this state, I now inclose, and wish Congress to adopt the regulation which the board have made, and to transmit me, by the earliest opportunity, commissions dated according to their arrangement. At the same time it may be proper that there should be a resolve vacating the commissions they now have, and directing them to be delivered to me. Their atten∣tion
<PB N="167" REF="031423_0463_0FEC5EA51D532BF0"/>
to this business, I trust, will be immediate: the disputes and jealousies with the officers require it.</P>
<P>I have inclosed the memorial of colonel Portail and the other engineers for their promotion, referred to me by the board of war for my sentiments.—As to the terms these gentlemen men∣tioned to have been proposed and agreed to when they first ar∣rived. I know nothing of them further than the memorial states. In respect to their abilities and knowledge in their profession, I must observe they have had no great opportunity of proving them since they were in our service. However, I have reason to believe that they have been regularly bred in this important branch of war, and that their talents, which have been hither∣to, as it were, dormant, want only a proper occasion to call them forth; in which case, I have no doubt they would do themselves honor, and the states essential service.—It is of great import∣ance, too, to consider the practicability of replacing these gen∣tlemen with persons equally qualified, if they should quit the service; and how indispensable men of skill in this branch of military science are to every army. While I am on this sub∣ject, I would take the liberty to mention that I have been well informed that the engineer in the northern army (Corieski, I think, his name is) is a gentleman of science and merit. From the character I have had of him, he is deserving of notice too.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to mention that we are in great distress for want of money. This will be more urgent every day: and it is probable there will be a great deal of pay due to the troops coming to reinforce us.—General Putnam writes pressingly for a supply, and says he is in a most disagreeable situation for the want of it.—I must request the attention of Congress to this subject.</P>
<P>Your favor of the seventh came to hand this morning. I shall pay proper attention to the inclosures.—The rank of the offi∣cers of cavalry I will attempt to have settled as soon as circum∣stances will admit.</P>
<P>I have nothing very interesting to communicate.—The ene∣my have lost one of their new floating batteries: it sunk in a little time after it was launched. There has been a cannonade to-day:—it still continues:—I do not know the occasion, but imagine it is between the ships and gallies.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The condition of the army for want of clothes and blan∣kets,—and the little prospect I have of obtaining relief, accord∣ing to the information I have received from the board of war,—occasion me to trouble you at this time. The mode of seiz∣ing and forcing supplies from the inhabitants, I fear, would prove very inadequate to the demands, while it would certainly embitter the minds of the people, and excite perhaps a hurtful jealousy against the army. I have had officers out for the pur∣pose of purchasing and making voluntary collections of necssa∣ries; and, in a few instances, more coercive measures have been exercised: but all these have proved of little avail: our distres∣ses still continue, and are becoming greater. I would therefore humbly submit it to the consideration of Congress whether it may not be expedient for them to address the several legislative and executive powers of the states on this subject as early as pos∣sible, and in the most urgent terms. It appears to me, if they were to appoint, under the authority of Congress, proper active agents, that many necessaries might be procured in addition to those [<HI>purchased</HI>] on public account. Besides this, I think the exigency of our affairs requires that they should resove on an immediate assessment to be made on the inhabitants.—If these modes were adopted, considerable aids might be derived, and in a way much less exceptionable than that of seizing by the army. The assemblies in many states, I believe, are now sitting; and I have no doubt, upon a requisition by Congress, but they will give attention to the measure.</P>
<P>Inclosed you will receive a copy of a letter from general Put∣nam, which came to hand to-day. You will find his and go∣vernor Clinton's opinion respecting the fortifications necessary to be made for the security of the North-river. As soon as I heard that Warner's militia were coming down to reinforce me, I immediately wrote to countermand them, and directed that they should be retained to carry on the necessary works during the time they are to serve.—My letter on this subject was on the ninth instant.—As to the other troops, the propriety of bringing them here, I believe, is not to be questioned. We are told through various channels that sir Henry Clinton is coming round with all the force that can possibly be spared from New-York; and it is said that those on Staten-Island are withdrawn. It is added also that the inhabitants of the former are greatly alarmed and disgusted, and that general Tryon is calling in the militia of Long-Island for the defence of the city. General Put∣nam's

<P>I have also the honor to transmit you a copy of a report by a board of general officers, on the subject of rations, which I submit to the consideration of Congress. The establishment and regulations which they propose appear to me to be just and necessary, supposing the commissary's estimate to be right, which I presume is the case, from the exorbitant price which has been and is now paid for every species of provision.—The necessity of an alteration in the former value has been long urged by many officers; and, for want of it, several, I believe, have left the service:</P>

<P>I AM sorry to inform you that Fort-Mifflin was evacuat∣ed the night before last, after a defence which does credit to the American arms, and will ever reflect the highest honor up∣on the officers and men of the garrison. The works were en∣tirely beat down, every piece of cannon dismounted, and one of the enemy's ships so near that she threw grenades into the fort, and killed men upon the platforms, from her tops, before they quitted the island. This ship had been cut down for the pur∣pose, and so constructed that she made but a small draught of water, and by these means warped in between Fort-Mifflin and Province-Island. Some complaints are made that the captains of the gallies did not sufficiently exert themselves to drive this vessel from her station: but I shall not determine any thing up∣on the matter till a proper enquiry is made.</P>
<P>Nothing in the course of this campaign has taken up so much of the attention and consideration of myself and all the general officers, as the possibility of giving a further relief to Fort-Mif∣flin
<PB N="170" REF="031423_0466_0FEC5EABAF3E4CA0"/>
than what we had already afforded. Such a garrison was thrown into it as has been found by experience capable of de∣fending it to the last extremity: and Red-bank, which was deemed essentially necessary, not only for the purpose of keep∣ing open the communication, but of annoying the enemy's ships and covering our own fleet, has been possessed by a considerable detachment from this army. The only remaining and practica∣ble mode of giving relief to the fort was by dislodging the ene∣my from Province-Island, from whence they kept up an inces∣sant fire. But this, from the situation of the ground, was not to be attempted with any degree of safety to the attacking par∣ty, without the whole or a considerable part of the army should be removed to the west side of Schuylkill to support and co∣ver it.</P>
<P>To account for this, you must be made acquainted with the nature of the ground. In order to have made the attack upon Province-Island, the party destined for that purpose,—which should have been at least fifteen hundred,—must have marched down the Chester road as far as the Bell inn near Derby, and thence, turning towards Delaware, must have proceeded about four miles further through a neck of land, to the island. The enemy have a bridge at the middle ferry upon Schuylkill, which is but four miles from the Bell inn; consequently, by throwing a body of men over that bridge upon the first discovery of our design, and marching down to the Bell, they would have effec∣tually cut off our detachment upon their return.—It is true the covering party might have consisted of a less number than the whole army: but then those remaining upon this side the river would have been too few to have been intrusted with all the artillery and stores of the army, within twelve miles of the e∣nemy.</P>
<P>There were many and very forcible reasons against a total re∣move to the west side of Schuylkill. Leaving all our stores at Easton, Bethlehem, and Allentown, uncovered,—and abandon∣ing several of our hospitals within reach of the enemy,—first presented themselves. Another, and in my opinion a more weighty reason than either of the preceding, was the importance of supporting the post at Red-bank, upon which that of Fort-Mifflin in a great measure depended, as through it we sent in supplies of men, provision, and ammunition. The enemy, sen∣sible of this, endeavored to dislodge us from Red-bank on the twenty-second of last month; which, as Congress have been in∣formed, cost them four hundred men.</P>
<P>Now, had our army been on the west side of Schuylkill, they
<PB N="171" REF="031423_0467_0FEC5D97A3C90A90"/>
might, without any danger of an attack upon their lines, have thrown over of considerable a force into Jersey, that they might have overpowered the garrison, and, by making themselves mas∣ters of it, have reduced Fort-Mifflin by famine or want of am∣munition. Thus we should in all probability have lost both posts by one stroke.—They might also, by taking possession of the fords upon Schuylkill, have rendered the junction of our northern reinforcements with us a very difficult, if not an im∣practicable matter: and, should any accident have happened to them, we should have stood a very poor chance of looking ge∣neral Howe in the face through the winter with an inferior ar∣my. We should finally have thrown the army into such a si∣tuation, that we must inevitable have drawn on a general en∣gagement before our reinforcements arrived; which, consider∣ing our disparity of numbers, would probably have ended with the most disagreeable consequences.</P>
<P>It was therefore determined a few days ago to wait the arri∣val of the reinforcement from the northward before any altera∣tion could safely be made in the disposition of the army: and I was not without hopes that the fort would have held out till that time.—That we might then have moved without endan∣gering the stores, I had-given orders for the removal of them, from the places before mentioned, to Lebanon and other places in Lancaster county, which is at any rate more safe and conve∣nient than where they were.</P>
<P>As the keeping possession of Red-bank, and thereby still preventing the enemy from weighing the chevaux-de-frise be∣fore the frost obliges their ships to quit the river, has become a matter of the greatest importance, I have determined to send down general St. Clair, general Knox, and baron Kalb, to take a view of the ground, and to endeavor to form a judgment of the most probable means of securing it. They will at the same time see how far it is possible for our fleet to keep their sta∣tion since the loss of Fort-Mifflin, and also make the proper in∣quiry into the conduct of the captains of the gallies, mentioned in the former part of this letter.</P>
<P>I am informed that it is matter of amazement, and that re∣flections have been thrown out against this army, for not being more active and enterprising than, in the opinion of some, they ought to have been. If the charge is just, the best way to ac∣count for it, will be to refer you to the returns of our strength, and those which I can produce of the enemy, and to the inclos∣ed abstract of the clothing now actually wanting for the army: and then I think the wonder will be, how they keep the field
<PB N="172" REF="031423_0468_0FEC5EAE616B5FC8"/>
at all in tents at this season of the year.—What stock the clo∣thier-general has to supply this demand, or what are his pros∣pects, he himself will inform you, as I have directed him to go to York-town to lay these matters before Congress. There are, besides, most of those in the hospitals more bare than those in the field:—many remain there for want of clothes only.</P>
<P>Several general officers, unable to procure clothing in the common line, have employed agents to purchase up what could be found in different parts of the country. General Wayne, among others, has employed Mr. Zantzinger of Lancaster, who has purchased to the amount of four thousand five hundred pounds, for which he desires a draught upon the treasury-board.—Inclosed you have a copy of his letter.—I am not clear whe∣ther this application should properly be made to the treasury, or the clothier-general, who should charge the money to the regiments for whom the clothes are, as so much advanced to them. If the latter should appear the most proper mode, I will order it to be done.</P>
<P>I am anxiously waiting the arrival of the troops from the northward, who ought, from the time they have had my or∣ders, to have been here before this. Colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, is up the North-river, doing all he can to push them forward: but he writes me word that he finds many un∣accountable delays thrown in his way. However I am in hopes that many days will not elapse before a brigade or two, at least, arrive.—The want of these troops has embarrassed all my mea∣sures exceedingly.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the thir∣teenth and nineteenth instant with their inclosures.—I am well assured Congress have not been inattentive to the necessities of the army: and that the deficiency in our supplies, particularly in the article of clothing, has arisen from the difficulty of im∣porting, on account of the numerous fleet that line our coast. However I am persuaded that considerable relief might be drawn from the different states, were they to exert themselves
<PB N="173" REF="031423_0469_0FEC5D9B8F704928"/>
properly. This I hope will be the case as soon as they receive the pressing recommendations of Congress upon the subject.</P>
<P>It has been the unvaried custom of the enemy, from the commencement of the present contest, to try every artifice and device to delude the people. The message through John Brown was calculated for this end. I am surprised Mr Willing should suffer himself to be imposed on by such flimsy measures. He knows that there is a plain obvious way for general and lord Howe to communicate any proposals they wish to make, to Congress, without the intervention of a second and third hand. But this would not suit their views.—I am sorry that Mr. Brown should be the bearer of the message; as, from the cha∣racter I have had of him, he is a worthy, well-disposed man. It has been frequently mentioned that he had interested him∣self much in behalf of our prisoners, and had afforded them e∣very relief and comfort his circumstances would allow him to give.</P>
<P>I have been endeavoring to effect an exchange of prisoners, from principles of justice, and from motives of humanity: but at present I have no prospect of it. Yet general Howe has as∣sured our officers it was his wish, and, if it could not be done, that he should readily agree to their release on parole.—The inclosed copies of my letters and his answer will shew Congress what has passed between us upon that subject; and at the same time, that I had remonstrated against the severe and cruel treatment of the prisoners, and proposed the plan of sending in a suitable person to inquire into the facts, before the receipt of their resolution. Their sufferings, I am persuaded, have been great, and shocking to humanity. I have called upon general Howe for redress, and an explicit answer to my letter of the fourteenth. If I do not receive one by to-morrow night, with the most positive and satisfactory assurances that a proper con∣duct shall be observed towards them in future, we must retali∣ate, however much we wish to avoid severity, and measures that bear the smallest appearance of rigor or inhumanity.</P>
<P>Inclosed you will receive a list of sundry officers who have been cashiered since the action of the fourth ultimo.—I flatter myself that these examples will involves many favorable and beneficial consequences.—Besides these, there were many more brought to trial, who were acquitted; among them, general Maxwell, and general Wayne,—the former for charges against him while he commanded the light troops,—the latter for charges against his conduct in the attack made on his division, in the night of the twentieth of September. The result of the
<PB N="174" REF="031423_0470_0FEC5EB02D8E4310"/>
court of inquiry against general Wayne not entirely exempting him from censure in his own opinion, he requested a court-mar∣tial; and, upon a full and minute investigation of the charges against him, he was honorably acquitted, and in terms of high respect.</P>
<P>I am sorry to inform Congress that the enemy are now in possession of all the water defences.—Fort-Mifflin and that at Red-bank mutually depended on each other for support; and the reduction of the former made the tenure of the latter ex∣tremely precarious, if not impracticable. After the loss of Fort-Mifflin, it was found Red-bank could derive no advantages from the gallies and armed vessels—(they could not maintain their station)—and, in case of investiture, the garrison could have no supplies, no retreat, nor any hope of relief, but such as might arise from a superior force acting without on the rear of the enemy, and dislodging them. Under these circumstances, the garrison was obliged to evacuate it on the night of the twentieth instant, on the approach of lord Cornwallis who had crossed the river from Chester with a detachment. supposed to be about two thousand men, and formed a junction with the troops lately arrived from New-York, and those that had been landed before at Billingsport.</P>
<P>From general Varnum's account, I have reason to hope that we saved most of the stores, except a few heavy cannon: how∣ever I cannot be particular in this instance.—I am also to add, from the intelligence I have received, that most if not all the armed vessels have been burned by our own people, except the gallies, one brig, and two sloops, which are said to have run by the city.—How far this might be founded in necessity, I am not able to determine; but I suppose it was done under that idea, and an apprehension of their falling into the enemy's hands if they attempted to pass up the river.</P>
<P>Upon the first information I had of lord Cornwallis's move∣ment, I detached general Huntington's brigade to join general Varnum, and, as soon as possible, general, Greene with his divi∣sion; hoping that these,—with Glover's brigade which was on the march through Jersey, and which I directed to file off to the left for the same purpose,—and with such militia as could be collected,—would be able to defeat the enemy's design, and to preserve the fort. But they were so rapid in their advances, that our troops could not form a juction and arrive in time to succour the garrison; which obliged them to withdraw.</P>
<P>General Greene is still in Jersey; and when Glover's bri∣gade joins him, if an attack can be made on lord Cornwallis
<PB N="175" REF="031423_0471_0FEC5EBAC115E888"/>
with a prospect of success, I am persuaded it will be done. A∣bout a hundred and seventy of Morgan's corps are also gone to reinforce him.</P>
<P>Generals Poor and Patterson with their brigades, and colonel Bailey with Learned's, are now in camp. The last arrived on friday evening, the other two in the course of yesterday. I have not yet obtained returns of their strength; but, from the accounts of the officers, they will amount in the whole to twen∣ty-three or twenty-four hundred rank and file. But I find ma∣ny of them are very deficient in the articles of shoes, stockings, breeches, and blankets.—Besides these, about three hundred and fifty men,—detachments from Lee's, Jackson's, and Hen∣ley's regiments,—have joined me.</P>
<P>Yesterday evening the enemy burned several houses in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, and they have committed the most wanton spoil in many others.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday morning honored with your favors of the twenty-second instant.—I wish the measures Congress have adopted may effectually suppress the disturbances in the western department. Should they prove successful and the savages and wicked deluded inhabitants receive a severe check, it is proba∣ble they will not be induced again to take part against us, or at least for some considerable time. Colonel Crawford set out yesterday evening, and will be with Congress I expect, in the course of two or three days to take their commands.</P>
<P>I was much obliged by the foreign intelligence you were pleased to transmit me: it is agreeable and interesting: and I heartily wish there may be an early declaration of hostilities between France and Britain. From these advices, things seem to be getting into a proper train for it: and it is not easily to be conceived that it can be much longer delayed. However our expectations have not been answered in this instance, and they may yet be held in suspense. The political reasons, that lead to delay on the part of France, I do not perfectly under∣stand. As to Britain, her honor is lost in the contest with us, and the most indignant insults will scarcely be able to draw her attention from her present pursuits.—The account of Mr. Lee having effected the purposes of his embassy at the court of Berlin is of great importance, if it be true. In such case,
<PB N="176" REF="031423_0472_0FEC5DA28A67CD98"/>
administration, however desirous they may be, will probably be disappointed in their schemes of further mercenary aides against us.</P>
<P>I must take the liberty to request the decision of Congress on the case of the nine first-raised Virginia regiments as early as circumstances will permit. If the plan proposed for re-en∣listing them is judged expedient, one capital inducement to that end, suggested by the officers, will cease if it is longer delayed. It is a matter of considerable importance, and of which I wish to be satisfied as soon as possible.—I should also be happy in their determination respecting the marquis De la Fayette. He is more and more solicitous to be in actual service, and is press∣ing in his applications for a command.—I ventured before to submit my sentiments upon the measure; and I still fear a re∣fusal will not only induce him to return in disgust, but may in∣volve some unfavorable consequences.—There are now some vacant divisions in the army, to one of which he may be ap∣pointed, if it should be the pleasure of Congress. I am con∣vinced he possesses a large share of that military ardor which generally characterises the nobility of his country. He went to Jersey with general Greene, and I find he has not been in∣active there. This you will perceive by the following extract from a letter just received from general Greene.</P>
<P>"The marquis, with about four hundred militia and the rifle corps, attacked the enemy's piquet last evening, killed a∣bout twenty, wounded many more, and took about twenty pri∣soners. The marquis is charmed with the spirited behavior of the militia and rifle corps:—they drove the enemy about half a mile, and kept the ground until dark. The enemy's piquet consisted of about three hundred, and were reinforced during the skirmish.—The marquis is determined to be in the way of danger."</P>
<P>* * * I must request you to transmit me a number of bank commissions as soon as you have an opportunity to do it. There are several vacancies yet to fill; and the officers entitled to them are anxious to be appointed. The commissions I want should be under your signature, and not Mr. Hancock's. I mention this, lest you should send any of the latter that might remain. Those signed by you will be competent to all cases: those by Mr Hancock, only to such as happened during his pre∣sidency; and of these I have now some.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 27.—Inclosed you will receive a copy of general Howe's letter in answer to mine of the fourteenth and twenty-third, which only came to hand last night, and at an instant
<PB N="177" REF="031423_0473_0FEC5EBCD31D0930"/>
when I was giving the commissary of prisoners instructions forthwith to confine a number of the officers in our hands, and to put the privates under very different restrictions from those they have been used to.—I am in hopes the treatment of ours will be much better in future. Mr. Boudinot will immediately take measures for releasing the officers on parole, that we may relieve an equal number of ours. I should have been happy to have effected a general exchange, or a partial one: but gene∣ral Howe will not upon any terms but those he has ever insist∣ed on.</P>
<P>The enemy have got up several of their ships to the city. It is likely they have found a passage through the chevaux-de-frise, or they may have removed them.</P>

<P>ON saturday I had the honor to receive your favor of the twenty-sixth ultimo with its inclosures.—The resolve of the twenty-fifth I have bulished in orders, agreeable to direction, and shall be happy if Congress can fall upon measures to render the situation of the officers and soldiery more eligible than what it now is. At present it is truly distressing: and, unless some means can be devised to support them more comfortably, we shall have to apprehend the most alarming consequences. The officers, or at least a large proportion of them, as well as the men, are in a most disagreeable condition as to clothing, and without any certain prospect of relief: and, what is still more painful,—if perchance they have an opportunity of purchasing (which is seldom the case), they have the mortification to find themselves totally incompetent to it, from the depreciation of our money, and the exorbitant prices demanded for all articles in this way.—This is the source of great uneasiness, of indiffer∣ence to the service, and of repeated (I may say, daily) applica∣tions to leave it, and these too by as good officers as are in the American line.</P>
<P>In respect to promotions for merit and intrepidity, I would beg leave to observe, that, though these are proper considera∣tions to found them upon, yet they should be made with the greatest caution and attention, and only in cases of the most e∣minent and distinguished services. Every promotion or rise out of common course cannot fail to excite uneasiness in a great∣er or lesser degree: and nothing will reconcile them to the ar∣my

my at large, and particularly the officers more immediately af∣fected by them,—but where the causes are known and acknow∣ledged. This I mention from my wishes to promote the public in∣terest, from my knowledge that harmony is essential to this end, and from no other motive whatever.</P>
<P>Before the receipt of your favor, I do not recollect to have heard of John Simper's case. His brother has not been with me. As soon as he arrives, I shall give directions for him to be released from his present confinement, and to be forwarded to Cecil county.</P>
<P>I have nothing material to inform Congress of.—Lord Corn∣wallis and the detachment under his command (mentioned in my last) returned from Jersey on thursday.—We had reason to expect an attack since, from our advices from the city, but have been disappointed.—General Greene has also joined me with all the troops that were with him, except Huntington's brigade, which will be in to-day.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, in the course of last week, from a variety of intelligence, I had reason to expect that general Howe was preparing to give us a general action. Accordingly, on thursday night he moved from the city with all his force, except a very inconsiderable part left in his lines and redoubts,—and appeared the next morning on Chesnut-hill, in front of, and about three miles distant from, our right wing. As soon as their position was discovered, the Pennsylvania mili∣tia were ordered from our right, to skirmish with their light advanced parties; and I am sorry to mention that brigadier-general Irvine who led them on had the misfortune to be wounded and to be made prisoner.—Nothing more occurred on that day.</P>
<P>On friday night, the enemy changed their ground, and moved to our left, within a mile of our line, where they remained qui∣et and advantageously posted the whole of the next day. On sunday they inclined still further to our left; and, from every appearance, there was reason to apprehend they were deter∣mined on an action.—In this movement, their advanced and flanking parties were warmly attacked by colonel Morgan and his corps, and also by the Maryland militia under colonel Gist. Their loss I cannot ascertain: but I am informed it was consi∣derable,
<PB N="179" REF="031423_0475_0FEC5EC01A69A090"/>
having regard to the number of the corps who engaged them.—About sun-set after various marches and counter-march∣es, they halted; and I still supposed, from their disposition and preceding manoeuvres, that they would attack us in the night or early the next morning: but in this I was mistaken.</P>
<P>On monday afternoon they began to move again, and, instead of advancing, filed off from their right: and the first certain ac∣count that I could obtain of their intentions was that they were in full march towards Philadelphia by two or three routes.—I immediate detached light parties after them to fall upon their rear: but they were not able to come up with them.</P>
<P>The enemy's loss, as I have observed, I cannot ascertain. One account from the city is that five hundred wounded had been sent in; another is that eighty-two waggons had gone in with men in this situation. These, I fear, are both exaggerated, and not to be depended upon.—We lost twenty-seven men in Morgan's corps, killed and wounded, besides major Morris, a brave and gallant officer, who is among the latter. Of the Maryland militia there were also sixteen or seventeen wounded. I have not received further returns yet.</P>
<P>I sincerely wish that they had made an attack, as the issue, in all probability,—from the disposition of our troops, and the strong situation of our camp,—would have been fortunate and happy. At the same time I must add, that reason, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbad us quitting our post to at∣tack them. Nothing but success would have justified the mea∣sure: and this could not be expected from their position.</P>
<P>The constant attention and watching I was obliged to give the enemy's movements would not allow me to write before: and this I believe was the less material, as I have reason to think your committee who were in camp most of the time, and who are now here, transmitted an account of such occur∣rences as they deemed important in any degree. The first cause too, sir, and my engagements with the committee previ∣ous to the coming out of the enemy, will, I trust, sufficiently apologise for my not acknowledging before the honor of your favors of the thirtieth ultimo and the first instant, which came to hand in due order and time.</P>

<P>I YESTERDAY evening had the honor of your favor of the first instant, with its several inclosures. The letter you allude to, from the committee of Congress and board of war, came to hand on saturday morning: but it does not mention the regulations adopted for removing the difficulties and failures in the commissary line. I trust they will be vigorous, or the army cannot exist. It will never answer, to procure supplies of clothing or provision by coereive measures:—the small sei∣zures made of the former a few days a ago in consequence of the most pressing and absolute necessity,—when that, or to dis∣solve, was the alternative,—excited the greatest alarm and un∣easiness even among our best and warmest friends. Such pro∣cedures may give a momentary relief; but, if repeated, will prove of the most pernicious consequence. Besides spreading disaffection, jealousy, and fear in the people, they never fail, even in the most veteran troops under the most rigid and exact discipline, to raise in the soldiery a disposition of licentiousness, to plunder and robbery,—difficult to suppress afterwards, and which has proved not only ruinous to the inhabitants, but, in many instances, to armies themselves.—I regret the occasion that compelled us to the measure the other day; and shall con∣sider

<P>If such officers and men as were in camp when the resolves were passed, and who continue the whole winter, are the only objects to be benefited, it is urged that many who have dis∣charged their duty with fidelity,—who have experienced a se∣vere campaign to that time or till a few days before,—who may be now out of camp, and yet be here in the course of the winter,—will be excluded. For example, all officers and men on furlough, though they should have been long from their homes before,—perhaps much longer in many instances, than many who remain,—and whose private necessities oblige them to be absent,—those who have fallen sick from their services, and who are in hospitals or in the country,—detachments on command,—these would be excluded. Such discriminations, I believe, will give great disgust and uneasiness.—It is diffi∣cult, in cases of this nature, to draw a proper line of distinc∣tion, and impossible to do it in such a way as to give satisfac∣tion.</P>
<P>I do not mean to enlarge upon the subject: my only wish is to have it precisely ascertained, who are to be included and paid, and who are not, under the resolves, that I may not on the one hand act contrary to the public intention, and on the other give cause of complaint, and perhaps do wrong to indivi∣duals.</P>
<P>Knowing the difficulty of drawing a proper line, and the dis∣gust and murmurings that ever attend discriminations,—were I to advise upon the subject, only such officers and men should be excluded (since extra pay has been determined on) as are ab∣sent from camp without regular authority, or such as may abuse indulgencies regularly obtained.</P>
<P>It has been observed by some, and perhaps with propriety, that there are officers and men now in camp, or who may be shortly in, who have no superior claim to merit,—whose affairs are not so pressing, or who have already had indulgencies,—or who, from their being nearer their friends and connections, have had opportunities of seeing them frequently, of ordering their concerns, and visiting their homes once, twice, or perhaps oftener in the campaign.—whilst they who were more remote were precluded from any of these advantages, and were con∣stantly on duty. These considerations will have their weight in the scale of disgust with the parties interested.—For my part,
<PB N="183" REF="031423_0479_0FEC5ECE5CA23728"/>
though the resolves were founded in principles of generosity,—were intended to reward merit, and promote the service,—from the difficulties attending the execution, I wish they had never been made, especially as I believe officers and men would in a little time have become tolerably well reconciled to their quar∣ters.</P>

<P>AS I do not recollect with precision whether any, or what resolutions have been made by Congress respecting cap∣tures by the army or detachments of it, and not having all their proceedings with me, with which I have been honored from time to time to assist my enquiries upon the subject,—I must take the liberty to request that they will determine, and favor me with their decisions upon, the following points:</P>
<P N="1">1. What articles captured are to be considered as public pro∣perty?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether articles captured by parties or detachments, not determined public property, are to be distributed or sold for the benefit of the army at large, or are to be considered as the sole and exclusive right of the captors?</P>
<P N="3">3. If, in general instances, such articles as are taken, and which are not considered public property, are determined to be the sole and exclusive right of the captors,—are stationary de∣tachments, who, from their situation, have much more than a common chance of making prizes, to be considered upon the same footing?</P>
<P N="4">4. If there is to be a distinction between stationary and other detachments,—and the former are denied an exclusive right to the captures they make,—what proportion of the articles are they to have?</P>
<P>I have been induced to state the above questions on account of some difficulties that have arisen respecting the prize taken by the detachment at Wilmington under general Smallwood, that the same may be determined, and certain principles esta∣blished, to govern in like and future cases.—In the instance of this prize, as the baggage taken (from general Smallwood's and the officers' representation) will be but inconsiderable when divided among themselves, I have consented that they shall have it at a just appraisement and distribution, and have directed him to have the whole, and the value, properly inven∣toried,
<PB N="184" REF="031423_0480_0FEC5ED765F94C58"/>
that such order may be made respecting the latter, as the decisions of Congress may justify and point out. I have also directed the sale of the brig, as I understand some offers have been made for her, and as her situation may be considered hazardous and precarious.</P>
<P>Besides the brig taken at Wilmington, a vessel has stranded at Reedy-Island with goods on board. It is said a quantity of rum, some bales of cloth, a number of hats, and some other ar∣ticles (all wanted by the army), have been taken out of her by the militia, particularly those of Kent county. These general Smallwood is endeavoring to find, that they may be of public benefit.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered to you by the chevalier De Mau∣duit du Plessis, who was among the first French officers that joined the army of the United States. The gallant conduct of this young gentlemen at Brandiwine, Germantown, and his dis∣dinguished services at Fort-Mercer where he united the offices of engineer and commandant of artillery, entitle him to the particular notice of Congress.—He made several judicious al∣terations in the works at Red-bank, shewed great good conduct during the action in which the Hessians were repulsed, and was spoken of, in consequence, in terms of the highest applause, by the commanding officer of the post.—After the evacuation was determined upon, he became the means of saving some valuable artillery and stores, and cheerfully undertook, as volunteer, the hazardous operation of blowing up the magazine, &amp;c. without the apparatus usually provided upon such occasions.—I must further add in monsieur Du Plessis' favor, that he possesses a de∣gree of modesty not always found in men who have performed brilliant actions. It is with pleasure therefore that I recom∣mend it to Congress to grant him a brevet of lieutenant-colo∣nel,—a reward due to his merit, and which will not have the inconvenience of occasioning any dissatisfaction in the corps to which he belongs.</P>
<P>As some particular circumstances have prevented monsieur Du Plessis waiting upon Congress sooner, I hope there will be no difficulty in antedating the bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et, so that the recompense may more immediately follow the services which he has done. At the same time, that there may not be any uneasiness on the

<P>P. S. I wish a supply of money to be sent as soon as possible. Our distresses for want of it are not easily to be described.—What Mr. Palfrey brought with him was not sufficient to pay the troops for November, by two hundred and fifty or three hundred thousand dollars. The demands were immense, most of the eastern troops having had four or five months' pay due to them, and some, more. The army now in general has three months' pay in arrear, exclusive of the month's extra pay; and, besides this, the quarter-master is pressing for large draughts for the purposes of his department, though he has received a proportion of the money which came with Mr. Palfrey.</P>

<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favor of the third instant, and with its inclosures.</P>
<P>As general M'Dougall's late severe illness and present feeble state will not permit him to proceed on the intended excursion into Canada, baron De Kalb will follow the marquis agreeable to his wish and the direction of Congress.</P>
<P>According to the promise contained in my last, I take the liberty to transmit you copies of such letters as have lately pass∣ed between general Howe and myself.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 12.—Since writing the above I have received ano∣ther letter from general Howe, of the fifth instant, a copy of which, and of my answer, you have also inclosed. By these you will perceive that he has proposed a general exchange of prisoners, and that I have acceded to it.—I have written to Mr. Boudinot, commissary in this line, requiring his return to camp; and shall give him directions to pursue the most speedy measures for accomplishing this business, so interesting to the unhappy officers and men in general Howe's hands, and to the cause of humanity.—There are some other matters, as you will discover, which I could not enter upon.</P>
<P>The situation of the affairs of the army has not till lately made it convenient to go into the inquiry directed by the re∣solve of the twenty-eighth of November, of the losses of the Forts Montgomery and Clinton in the state of New-York, and
<PB N="187" REF="031423_0483_0FEC5EDEA38FD9F0"/>
of Fort-Mifflin on Delaware. With respect to the two former, it happens that almost all the principal officers acting in that quarter were in some way or other so far concerned in the af∣fair, as to make them improper for prosecuting the inquiry; I therefore propose to send officers from this army. If his health will permit, I should wish general M'Dougall to preside. His thorough knowledge of those posts and all their connections qualifies him in a peculiar manner for the purpose.—I have written to him on the subject.</P>
<P>With respect to Fort-Mifflin, the inquiry involves very ex∣tensive considerations, and more or less, affects almost all the general officers in this army, whose advice and concurrence in the measures taken make them in some degree parties. The mode, in my opinion, most unexceptionable, to be pursued, is for Congress to authorise a committee of their own body, or to delegate any other persons they may chuse to entrust, not con∣nected with the operations of this army, to go into the business.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 14.—Your several favors of the seventh, and that of the eighth instant, were duly received yesterday evening.—As soon as circumstances will admit, I shall appoint a court-mar∣tial in the case directed, and shall notify the parties concerned of the same.—The oath, which Congress have prescribed to be taken by the officers of the army, I shall publish in general or∣ders, and the mode how it is to be done, with directions about the certificates.—I shall extend colonel Dyer's furlough to the first of April, as required.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the honor of your several favors of the eightenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first instant, which, with their respective inclosures, have been duly re∣ceived.</P>
<P>In compliance with the resolution of Congress of the fifth instant, transmitted in your letter of the seventh, I was about to take measures for appointing a court-martial and bringing on the trials which they direct. But on recurring to the pa∣pers you were pleased to send me, I do not find that the com∣mittee have made any particular charges against the officers who are to be the objects of trial. It was probably the inten∣tion of Congress that these charges should be laid by me. But as I might err in doing it, and not fully correspond with their
<PB N="188" REF="031423_0484_0FEC47AF991AC200"/>
views in the matter,—especially as it would require considera∣ble time and thought to make myself sufficiently acquainted with it from the papers collected,—I should think it would be most advisable for Congress to state explicitly the charges they wish to have exhibited against the officers respectively; and then the business may be proceeded on with propriety.</P>
<P>Besides the above reasons which operate generally against my exhibiting the charges,—in the particular instance of gene∣ral Schuyler, it is impossible for me to do it, as I do not know what instructions he had received from Congress from time to time as to the objects of his command, nor precisely what these were. These appear to me necessary to be known, and essential to carry on a prosecution against him.</P>
<P>When Congress shall have arranged these points, and are pleased to honor me with them, I will pursue the speediest mea∣sures to bring on the trials.—The sooner this can be done, the better, as some of the parties are extremely anxious, and strong∣ly importune it.</P>
<P>Baron Steuben has arrived at camp. He appears to be much of a gentleman, and, as far as I have had an opportunity of judging, a man of military knowledge, and acquainted with the world.</P>
<P>The inclosed extract of a letter from general Putnam will shew how great the distresses are in that quarter for want of money. He has described their necessities so fully, that it is unnecessary for me to add upon the subject: I shall only observe that his account is more than justified by many other letters, and that I am persuaded the earliest possible supply will be for∣warded, that the very important and interesting works carrying on there may not be the least retarded.</P>
<P>I am under some embarrassments respecting the thirteenth Virginia regiment. It was raised on the west side of the Alle∣gany and towards Pittsburg, with assurances from the officers, it is said, that the men should not be drawn from that quarter. This circumstance, added to the disturbances by the Indians, and the exposed situation of their families, has been the cause of great desertions, and is at present the source of much uneasiness, and the more so, as part of the regiment was never marched from thence.—I think the whole should be united either here or there, and wish Congress to direct me upon the subject.—At the same time that their case, if truly represented, seems to be hard, and to merit the indulgence they claim, I would ob∣serve that the twelfth regiment from the western parts of the same state, and the eighth and twelfth Pennsylvania from the
<PB N="189" REF="031423_0485_0FEC5DACAF97E238"/>
frontier counties of this, have similar pretensions, and might become uneasy, and apply for a like indulgence.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the directions of Congress, I shall send a major-general to Rhode-Island though the number of officers here of this rank, from one cause and another, is greatly reduced, and more so than it ought to be in point of policy.</P>
<P>Our loss of matrosses, the last campaign, in killed and wound∣ed, was considerable; and it has not been a little increased this winter by desertions from colonel Proctor's corps. From these circumstances, we are very weak in this line; and I request that Congress will be pleased to order colonel Harrison's regiment of artillery to march from Virginia as early as the roads will admit, and join this army.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the liberty of transmitting you copies of three, letters from general Howe, of the fourteenth and twenty-first ultimo, and of the second instant, with their inclosures. The unhappy violation of the flag of truce has laid us under no small embarrassments, and has afforded the enemy good grounds for complaint and triumph at the same time. This however is the natural consequence, and must ever be the case, where different powers counteract each other in matters of the most delicate importance. There are some circumstances attending this affair, which it may possibly be in the power of Congress to throw light upon.—If they can, I shall be obliged by their as∣sistance.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 8.—In consequence of the letters which have lately passed between general Howe and myself,—particularly those of the fifth and tenth ultimo, copies of which I had the honor to transmit you in mine of the eighth, continued to the four∣teenth,—I was about to send commissioners to meet those ap∣pointed by general Howe for adjusting the disputed points be∣tween us, carry into execution an exchange of prisoners, and improving the old cartel, as far as it might be practicable, for their better accommodation in future. This meeting was to be on the tenth instant: but, yesterday morning, Dunlap's paper of the fourth being put into my hands, I found that a resolution had been made the twenty-sixth of February, calling for all ac∣counts against prisoners in our hands, and declaring that no ex∣change should take place, till the balance due thereon to the
<PB N="190" REF="031423_0486_0FEC5EE951639960"/>
United States is discharged. Some of the states are not re∣quired to exhibit their claims till the first of June.—The time that would be taken to adjust them, and make a delivery of the prisoners, would more than exhaust all the ensuing summer.</P>
<P>This resolution I cannot consider as an intended infraction of my engagements with general Howe: yet its operation is dia∣metrically opposite both to the spirit and letter of the proposi∣tions made on my part, and acceded to on his. I supposed my∣self fully authorised "by the instructions and intentions" of Congress to act as I did: and I now conceive that the public as well as my own personal honor and faith are pledged for the performance.</P>
<P>By the direction of Congress, I in the first instance stipulated with general Howe an exchange of prisoners,—officer for offi∣cer, of equal rank,—soldier for soldier,—and citizen for citi∣zen. This agreement they have ever approved, and repeatedly declared their willingness to carry into execution.—Their reso∣lution of the twenty-fourth of March last empowered me (on condition of general Lee being declared exchangeable) not on∣ly "<HI>to proceed</HI>" to the exchange of prisoners according to the principles and regulations of the cartel before agreed on, but also to enter into such further principles and regulations as should appear to me most proper and advantageous. A subse∣quent resolution of the sixth of June holds forth the same lan∣guage, sanctions my conduct and reasonings in the negociations about that time on the subject, and directs an adherence to them.—No event has occurred since that period, by which I could conclude there was any alteration in the views of Con∣gress:—so far from it, that all my late letters breathing the same spirit with the former, and pointedly signifying my wish to bring about a general exchange,—if not with an express,—at least met with a tacit approbation.—General Howe at length by profession, if not in reality, is willing to perform the agree∣ment on the conditions required by me, and confirmed by them.</P>
<P>It may be said, that, with whatever powers I was originally vested to negotiate an exchange, the resolution of the nine∣teenth of December last was an abridgment of them, so far as to annex a new condition,—the settlement and payment of accounts previous to its taking place.—I had no conception of this being the case in the present instance, however the letter may warrant the construction. Besides the common principle of preventing the inconveniencies necessarily resulting from al∣lowing the enemy to make their payments in paper currency, I had reason to imagine that general Burgoyne's army was
<PB N="191" REF="031423_0487_0FEC5EEB0A208780"/>
more particularly the object of the concluding clause. This interpretation I the more readily adopted; for, exclusive of the affairs of that army, I verily believed, that, from the confused defective state of our accounts relating to prisoners, there would be a considerable balance in favor of Mr. Howe. Nor was the situation of our accounts the only reason for this belief:—the prisoners in our hands, especially those westward of the De∣laware, as I am informed, have been in a great measure sup∣ported by their own labor, and at the expense of the enemy, who have had agents constantly among us.—If this is the case, the reason of the resolve not applying, the effect ought not of course.</P>
<P>But perhaps it may be thought contrary to our interest to go into an exchange, as the enemy would derive more immedi∣ate advantage from it then we should.—This I shall not deny: but it appeared to me, that, on principles of genuine, extensive policy, independent of the considerations of compassion and jus∣tice, we were under an obligation not to elude it. I have the best evidence that an event of this kind is the general wish of the country:—I know it to be the wish of the army; and no one can doubt that it is the ardent wish of the unhappy suffer∣ers themselves. We need only consult the tide of humanity, and the sympathies natural to those connected by the cements of blood, interest, and a common dread of evil, to be convinced that the prevailing current of sentiment demands an exchange. If the country, the army, and even the prisoners themselves, had a precise idea of our circumstances, and could be fully sen∣sible of the disadvantages that might attend the giving our e∣nemy a considerable reinforcement without having an equiva∣lent, they might perhaps be willing to make a sacrifice of their feelings to the motives of policy. But they have not this knowledge, and cannot be entrusted with it; and their reason∣ings, of necessity, will be governed by what they feel.</P>
<P>Were an opinion once to be established (and the enemy and their emissaries know very well how to inculcate it, if they are furnished with a plausible pretext), that we designedly avoided an exchange, it would be a cause of dissatisfaction and disgust to the country and to the army,—of resentment and despera∣tion to our captive officers and soldiers:—to say nothing of the importance of not hazarding our national character but up∣on the most solid grounds, especially in our embryo state, from the influence it may have on our affairs abroad,—it may not be a little dangerous to beget in the minds of our own country∣men
<PB N="192" REF="031423_0488_0FEC5EF27199B160"/>
a suspicion that we do not pay the strictest observance to the maxims of honor and good faith.</P>
<P>It is prudent to use the greatest caution not to shock the no∣tions of general justice and humanity, universal among man∣kind as well in a public as a private view. In a business on the side of which the passions are so much concerned as in the present, men would be readily disposed to believe the worst, and cherish the most unfavorable conclusions. Were the let∣ters that, have passed between general Howe and myself from first to last, and the proceedings of Congress on the same sub∣ject, to be published with proper comments, it is much to be feared,—if the exchange should be deferred till the terms of the last resolve were fulfilled,—that it would be difficult to prevent our being generally accused with a breach of good faith. Perhaps it might be said, that, while the enemy refused us justice, we fondly embraced the opportunity to be loud, per∣severing, incessant in our claims; but the moment they were willing to render it, we receded from ourselves, and started new difficulties.—This, I say, might be the reasoning of specu∣lative minds; and they might consider all our professions as <HI>mere</HI> professions; or, at best, that interest and policy were to be the only arbiters of their validity.</P>
<P>Imputations of this nature would have a tendency to unnerve our operations, by diminishing that respect and confidence which are essential to be placed in those who are at the head of af∣fairs either in the civil or military line. This, added to the prospect of hopeless captivity, would be a great discouragement to the service. The ill consequences of both would be immense, by increasing the causes of discontent in the army, which are already too numerous, and many of which are in a great mea∣sure unavoidable,—by fortifying that unwillingness which al∣ready appears too great, towards entering into the service, and of course impeding the progress both of draughting and re∣cruiting,—by dejecting the courage of the soldiery, from an apprehension of the horrors of captivity,—and finally by reduc∣ing those, whose lot it is to drink the bitter cup, to a despair which can only find relief by renouncing their attachments and engaging with their captors. These effects have already been experienced in part from the obstacles that have lain in the way of exchanges: but if these obstacles were once to seem the result of system, they would become ten-fold.—Nothing has operated more disagreeably upon the minds of the militia than the fear of captivity, on the footing it has hitherto stood.—
<PB N="193" REF="031423_0489_0FEC5EF4B01324E8"/>
What would be their reasonings, if it should be thought to stand upon a worse?</P>
<P>If a present temporary interest is to be a ruling principle, it is easy to prove that an exchange can never take place. The constitution of our army in respect to the term of service for which our men engage, and the dependence we are obliged to place on the militia, must forever operate against us in ex∣changes, and forbid an equality of advantages. Should it be said that there are times when it might be more peculiarly un∣equal and injurious, and that the present is such on account of the weak condition of our army,—I answer that the delay ne∣cessarily involved in the previous negociation on the subject, in delivering the prisoners from time to time in small numbers and receiving others in their stead, and the mode of delivery at dif∣ferent places, will nearly bring the matter to the point we could wish, and give us leisure to reinforce this army (if it is to be done at all), so as to obviate in a great measure the ill conse∣quences apprehended.</P>
<P>But if the argument of interest on a partial scale be pursued as far as it will go, not only the general consideration thrown out above, but special ones apposite to every situation, will pre∣sent themselves, that we ought not to exchange:—now we ought not, because our army is weak!—when the season is more advanced, and it is time for the campaign to open, we ought not, because our army may be strong, and it will be our business to avail ourselves of our own strength and the enemy's weakness, to strike some decisive blow!—if they, by the pro∣tection of their shipping and impregnable works, should be able to baffle our attempts till the period of reinforcements from Europe arrive, it will surely then not be our interest to add numbers and strength to an enemy already sufficiently nume∣rous and strong!—Thus, by a parity of reasoning, the golden aera will never come, which is to relieve the miseries of capti∣vity. Our service must become odious: those who are out of it will endeavor to keep so; and those who are in it will wish to get out of it: every prisoner the enemy makes will be his soldier rather than submit to a rigorous and despairing confine∣ment.</P>
<P>If we do not seize the present propitious moment when the necessities of the enemy press them to reasonable terms, to form and establish a liberal cartel, it is not impossible, in the vicissi∣tudes and reverses of war, that a time may come when we should wish we had embraced it, and interest may strongly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enemy to decline it, except on the most unequal condi∣tions.
<PB N="194" REF="031423_0490_0FEC5EF94828CE60"/>
True policy, as well as good faith, in my opinion, binds us to improve the occasion.</P>
<P>There are however some ambiguities in general Howe's con∣duct, which require explanation, and ought to put us upon our guard.—I determined to make the affair of citizens,—<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to procure an exemption from captivity for them, if possible,—or, if not, (since it cannot now be demanded as a matter of right) to fix their exchangeability upon the easiest and most unequivo∣cal foundation.—an indispensable preliminary to any further procedure; and at the same time to secure the exchange of ge∣neral Lee and all other officers who have been the particular objects of exception.</P>
<P>The interview intended between general Howe's commission∣ers and those on our part on the tenth instant is now postponed. I cannot doubt that Congress, in preservation of the public faith and my personal honor, will remove all impediments that now oppose themselves to my engagements, and that they will authorise me, through commissioners appointed for the purpose, to negociate a more extensive and competent cartel, upon such principles as may appear advantageous and founded in necessity,—any resolutions heretofore to the contrary notwithstanding; and I must request that they will favor me with their answer by the earliest opportunity.</P>
<P>The work, from its nature, will be difficult. Two parties are concerned, whose interests are more than opposite in a com∣mon view.—We shall endeavor to act for the best, and to pro∣mote the public service as far as possible, though we may not be able to answer the expectations of all. But it should be re∣membered, that, although general Howe's want of men affords a prospect of favorable terms, yet he will not be disposed to sacrifice to it all considerations of general advantage in a con∣tract of such a nature; and it is not even to be hoped that it can take place except on principles of mutual benefit.</P>
<P>I persuade myself that the freedom I have taken in deliver∣ing my sentiments so fully upon this occasion will readily be excused, as it proceeds from a desire to place the motives of my conduct in a just point of view, and from an opinion of du∣ty that led me to a free discussion of a subject, which consi∣dered in all its lights, will appear to comprehend consequences of the first delicacy and magnitude.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been this day favored with yours of the twen∣ty-seventh of February, and of the second, third, and fourth instant, which I shall answer in their order.</P>
<P>The removal of so valuable a train of field artillery from Albany to Farmington, as to a place of greater security, was certainly a measure highly proper; and you may be assured that every precaution shall be taken to escort them safely through Jersey to this camp, when it is thought advisable to bring them hither.</P>
<P>You mistook the intent of mine of the eighteenth of Febru∣ary. I did not mean to give you the trouble of making a re∣turn of the British officers who were exchanged after the con∣vention. General Reidesel, as I informed you wrote to me to obtain liberty for him to make an exchange of some of his suite and other foreign officers, as that liberty had been allow∣ed to the British. I did not chuse to give him any answer un∣til I had applied to you, that I might know whether you had any reason for making such distinction: and as you misappre∣hended me, I shall still be obliged to defer answering him till I hear from you.—I think, considering the great number of of∣ficers of ours who are in captivity, it is our interest to exchange as many of their officers, prisoners under the convention, as we can.</P>
<P>Commissioners from me are to meet others from general Howe on the thirty-first of this month, to endeavor to settle a general exchange of prisoners.—Until we know the issue of the negociation, it will be hardly worth while to alter the situation of the prisoners in Lancaster county.</P>
<P>On the twenty-seventh of February I had occasion to write to Congress, on the subject of yours of the third. It was oc∣casioned by a representation from the colonel of the thirteenth Virginia regiment which was raised (as colonel M'Kay's and Cooke's were) to remain upon the frontier. Were this the case with only one regiment, I should not hesitate, considering the face of affairs to the westward, to order it immediately to Fort-Pitt or the neighborhood. But the eighth and twelfth Pennsylvania, and the twelfth and thirteenth Virginia, all claim the same right; and if the indulgence is granted to one, the others will be dissatisfied: and to spare them all at this time is impossible.</P>
<P>To regain the deserters from those regiments is certainly a very desirable thing; and the mode you point out is the most
<PB N="196" REF="031423_0492_0FEC5F01A224B518"/>
probable. But I fear, if those men who are now here find that the deserters are not to be brought down to join their regiments in camp, that they may be induced to go off, in hopes of ob∣taining the same terms. I confess I am much embarrassed by this matter, and shall be exceedingly glad to have the advice and assistance of Congress and the board upon the subject, be∣fore I come to any determination. It is an evil that will ever result from enlistments for local purposes, when it is not conve∣nient to abide by the agreement.</P>
<P>I shall immediately transmit the papers, inclosed in yours of the fourth, to general Howe.</P>

<P>P. S. Several instances having occurred, in which officers have drawn clothing from the clothier-general, not being enti∣tled to it,—I shall be glad, if any applications are made to the board in future, that they will never give orders to any but such as bring testimonials from the brigadier or officer com∣manding the brigade they belong to.—Some who have resigned have taken up clothing on their return home.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON sunday night I had the honor to receive your favors of the first and fifth instant, with their inclosures.</P>
<P>I am happy to find that my past conduct respecting citizens, in the correspondence between general Howe and myself, is ap∣proved by Congress. They may rest assured that their rights are strongly impressed on my mind; and that, in all my trans∣actions, every support in my power shall be given them. I know their importance; and, in my expected negociations with general Howe, if possible, I will exempt citizens from captivi∣ty. However I cannot hope to effect it, as I cannot demand it as a matter of right, since Congress themselves, in their ori∣ginal resolve directing a proposition to be made for the exchange of prisoners, mentioned that of citizens,—which implied a right of capturing them.</P>
<P>They may be assured that general Lee will not be forgotten. He has all along been a principal object in dispute: and, so far from doing any thing injurious to him, his right to be exchang∣ed, and his releasement, are intended to be placed upon the most explicit, unambiguous footing.—Indeed, from the spirit of general Howe's letters collectively taken, since his agreement to enlarge the officers on parole in the first instance, and his ex∣tension
<PB N="197" REF="031423_0493_0FEC5DB39482AFC8"/>
of it in the exchange,—though they are not free from ambiguities,—it may be inferred, that, on sending in lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Hessian field-officers captured at Trenton, an exchange of all officers will immediately commence. It seems to be a point with him that it shall begin with them, as they have been longest in captivity.—I have taken the li∣berty to inclose you copies of three letters which have just pas∣sed between general Howe and myself, more particularly con∣cerning general Lee, in which I have pushed matters respecting him as far as I thought it prudent at this time.—Every pre∣caution will certainly be used to prevent the enemy gaining a∣ny advantage in the exchange of prisoners.</P>
<P>With great deference, I would take the liberty to observe that Congress seemed to have carried the preamble of their re∣solve of the twenty-sixth ultimo, prohibiting the enlisting, &amp;c. prisoners and deserters, too far; and, through accident, to have recited a fact that has never happened (at least to my know∣ledge), and which is injurious to us,—<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that prisoners had been enlisted by us. If any have, it is what I never knew. However, be this as it may, if the resolution has not been pub∣lished, I could wish the preamble to be altered, and only to re∣cite, "<HI>that experience,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>deserters</HI>" only. The resolution itself may stand as it does, comprehending a prohibition against the enlistment of both.</P>
<P>My reason for troubling Congress upon this occasion is,—we have always complained against general Howe, and still do, for obliging and permitting the prisoners in his hands to enlist, as an unwarrantable procedure, and wholly repugnant to the spirit at least of the cartel. This preamble seems to admit the practice on our part, which would certainly justify it in him, and is such evidence as must silence us in future (should it stand), and afford him an opportunity for recrimination,—though, as I have suggested, I believe no prisoners have ever been enlisted by us,—I am sure, none have through compul∣sion.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to transmit you an extract of a letter from captain Barry, which will inform you of his successes. The two ships he burned after stripping them; and he was o∣bliged, it seems, two days after the capture, to ground and a∣bandon the schooner, after a long and severe engagement with some of the enemy's frigates and smaller armed vessels.—It is said he saved her guns and most of her tackle.</P>
<P>I also take the liberty to lay before Congress copies of let∣ters from messieurs Champion, Wadsworth, and Reed. From
<PB N="198" REF="031423_0494_0FEC5F502D0F9948"/>
the uniformity of sentiment held forth by these gentlemen, it is much to be feared the measures lately adopted by the commis∣sioners at New-haven, for regulating the prices of provision, will have a disagreeable effect upon our supplies of meat.—How far it may be practicable to suspend their operation for a time, I cannot determine: but, if it can be done, it appears we should experience many advantages from it. It is a matter of great importance; and as such, is submitted to Congress for their consideration.—If any thing can be done to procure sup∣plies of provision, particularly of the salt kind, I should suppose, and am persuaded, it will not be omitted.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be presented to you by count Pulaski, who, from a conviction that his remaining at the head of the cavalry was a constant subject of uneasiness to the principal officers of that corps, has been induced to resign his command. Waving a minute inquiry into the causes of dissatisfaction,—which may be reduced perhaps to the disadvantages under which he labor∣ed, as a stranger not well acquainted with the language, genius and manners of this country,—it may be sufficient to observe that the degree of harmony which is inseparable from the well-being and consequent utility of a corps, has not subsisted in the cavalry since his appointment, and that the most effectual as well as the easiest remedy is that which he has generously applied.</P>
<P>The count however, far from being disgusted with the ser∣vice, is led by his thirst of glory, and zeal for the cause of li∣berty, to solicit farther employment, and waits upon the Con∣gress to make his proposals. They are briefly that he be al∣lowed to raise an independent corps composed of sixty-eight horse and two hundred foot,—the horse to be armed with lan∣ces, and the foot equipped in the manner of light infantry. The former he thinks he can readily fill with natives of good character and worthy the trust reposed in them. With respect to the other, he is desirous of more latitude, so as to have li∣berty of engaging prisoners and deserters from the enemy.</P>
<P>The original plan for the lance-men was to have draughted them from the regiments of horse. But, as this method would produce a clashing of interests and perhaps occasion new distur∣bances, the count prefers having a corps totally unconnected
<PB N="199" REF="031423_0495_0FEC5F51F763EA98"/>
with any other. My advice to him, therefore, is to enlist his number of cavalry with the continental bounty; and, if it should be found consonant to the views of Congress to allow his raising the number proposed over and above the establish∣ment for the horse, then he would have them on the footing of an independent corps: if not, he might at all events have them as draughts; and in this case there would be no ground for complaint.</P>
<P>With regard to the infantry, which the count esteems essen∣tial to the success of the cavalry, I have informed him that the enlisting deserters and prisoners is prohibited by a late resolve of Congress.—How far Congress might be inclined to make an exception, and license the engaging prisoners in a particular detached corps, in which such characters may be admitted with less danger than promiscuously in the line,—I cannot undertake to pronounce.</P>
<P>I have only to add that the count's valor and active zeal on all occasions have done him great honor; and, from a persua∣sion, that, by being less exposed to the inconveniences which he has hitherto experienced, he will render great services with such a command as he asks for, I wish him to succeed in his application.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to transmit you a letter from gover∣nor Clinton which he inclosed to me for my perusal and consi∣deration.—The inconvenience he mentions, as resulting from the resolve respecting the appointment of a commandant for Forts Montgomery and Clinton, requires to be obviated. I do not conceive it to have been the design of Congress to make the command of those forts altogether distinct and independent on the general command of the posts in that quarter; but only to designate the rank of the officer who should have the im∣mediate charge of them.</P>
<P>There is such an intimate connexion between the forts and the other posts and passes in the Highlands and their vicinity, that it is necessary for one officer to have the superintendency
<PB N="103" REF="031423_0496_0FEC5F541961E8D8"/>
and control of the whole, and to be answerable for all. If this were not to be the case, but the command were not to be di∣vided, there might want that co-operation between the garri∣sons and the troops without, which might be essential to their preservation and to the common purposes of defence. The as∣signing a fixed number of men to the garrisons would not re∣move this inconvenience; for the co-operation would still be necessary. But if it were otherwise, I should not think the measure advisable, because we do not know what number of men we may have in the field next campaign; and the num∣ber for the defence of the Highlands must be proportioned to the general strength; and the force of the garrisons, to that number.</P>
<P>On these considerations, having ordered general M'Dougal to repair to the Highlands to assume the chief command there, I have comprehended the forts among the other objects of his trust; in the discharge of which, I am persuaded he will mani∣fest adequate zeal and ability. But as the resolve in ques∣tion affords room for doubt, it will be proper to have it ex∣plained, so as more explicitly to ascertain the intention of Con∣gress.</P>
<P>I am perfectly in sentiment with governor Clinton on the propriety of drawing the troops from the northward to reinforce and carry on the works in the Highlands. From every thing I can learn, there seems to be no prospect of prosecuting the intended expedition into Canada. If so, I apprehend it can answer no valuable end to keep a body of troops in and about Albany.—In the present circumstances of Canada, little is to be dreaded thence: the enemy, in all probability, will be well satisfied to act on the defensive, without risking the consequen∣ces of an attempt against us. A proper garrison at Fort-Schuyler, and a small party by way of guard at Albany, with the militia of the country that may be occasionally drawn to∣gether, will be a sufficient security against the inroads from the enemy from Canada, or the depredations of the neighbouring Indians, supposing there were any of the tribes whose disposi∣tions were still actively hostile notwithstanding our late northern successes,—which is by no means a natural supposition.—All the men, more than are wanted for these purposes, would be of the most important utility in the Highlands.</P>
<P>If the arms and stores at Albany should be thought an ob∣jection to the plan, I would beg leave to observe that Albany appears to me a most improper place for stationary arsenals or magazines, and that those which are there at present should
<PB N="201" REF="031423_0497_0FEC5F5814B29198"/>
be removed without delay. Besides, as they would be in most danger from an incursion up the North-river, the best way to counteract that danger is to strengthen the passes in the High∣lands, and obstruct the navigation; in order to which the rein∣forcing them with the troops from the northward would be no inconsiderable step.—With the greatest respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be delivered to you by captain Sullivan, who waits on Congress upon the subject of pay and the loss of his rank in the line of the Massachusetts officers.—He is one of the gentlemen, who, in going with major Sherburne to relieve the post we had at the cedars in 1776, after a brave and gallant conduct, fell into the enemy's hands. In a few days after, on the treaty which general Arnold made, he generously offered himself, as I have been informed, and went one of the hostages to Quebec, for the performance of it.</P>
<P>By some means the state of Massachusetts-Bay has not conti∣nued him in their line, nor has he any appointment in the ar∣my. He is now on parole, through the indulgence of general Carleton, and has applied to me for pay and rations from the time of his return: and considering also the deprivation of his rank as hard and injurious, he hopes he will be provided for in a suitable manner, and according to that standing which he for∣merly held in the army.</P>
<P>Captain Sullivan's wishes, in either instance, cannot be an∣swered by me.—As to the first, the resolution of the nineteenth of January, regulating the pay of prisoners (which is the only rule for my government) seems to have drawn the line between officers on parole who are continued in service, and those who are not; and, making that the only criterion to fix pay, to have precluded every other discrimination: and the powers, which were vested in the respective states to appoint officers, prohibit any interference by me in his favor, as to the latter.</P>
<P>I have stated the nature of the captain's claims, and the rea∣sons which are opposed to his obtaining relief in either instance from me. I shall only add that the neglect by the states (in their appointments) of the officers who were in captivity, where there was no other objection to them, was at least ungenerous, if not impolitic and unjust. It has been the case in many in∣stances: and as to the gentlemen who is particularly the subject
<PB N="202" REF="031423_0498_0FEC5F5A67C580D8"/>
of this letter, the testimonials that have been given of his cha∣racter as an officer were much in his favor, and greatly to his honor.</P>
<P>By accident, the resolution of the nineteenth of January, al∣luded to above, has been mislaid. I must trouble you with a request for another copy of it.</P>
<P>I transmit Congress colonel * * *'s application to resign. As general Huntington, in whose brigade he is, and in whom I have the utmost confidence, is perfectly willing, I have only to say upon the occasion that I have not the smallest objection to the measure.</P>
<P>General Sullivan set out for Rhode-Island on friday last, to take the command there in consequence of the resolution of Congress directing me to send a major-general there for that purpose. Supposing general Greene in the quarter-master line, I have now only one major-general left in camp.</P>

<P>ON saturday I had the honor to receive your favor of the tenth, with the resolutions alluded to.</P>
<P>Inclosed I take the liberty to transmit an extract of a letter just received from general Parsons.—This, as well as the letter which I inclosed you yesterday from governor Clinton, will shew the confusion in the management of affairs on the North-river. I informed Congress then that I had sent general M'∣Dongal to take the chief command there, comprehending the forts,—which appeared to me the only effectual means for cur∣ing all disorders, and promoting the public service.—To remove all impediments, it were to be wished that Congress would in∣vest him with every necessary power for carrying into execu∣tion the objects of his command: and it might be well if they were to extend to any future commanding officer, as it would prevent those difficulties which have heretofore arisen from their having been considered as merely personal.</P>
<P>I am more and more in sentiment with governor Clinton on the propriety and absolute necessity of drawing the troops from the northward, to reinforce and carry on the works in the High∣lands. From the information I have from colonel Radiere who has just come from thence, I find that the intended defences are far less advanced than I had any idea of. According to him, little or nothing is yet done, though I have repeatedly and con∣stantly
<PB N="203" REF="031423_0499_0FEC5F651DDBAD40"/>
urged the prosecution of them with all possible industry. The inclosed copies of my letters to general Putnam will shew that I have uniformly pressed the closest attention to the busi∣ness,—though it might be inferred from general Parsons's let∣ter that there had been some inconsistency in my orders. There remains but a little time to do a great deal in; and I fear that no exertions now will be sufficient to place things in that quar∣ter on the secure and respectable footing we could wish. How∣ever, we should do the most we can: and if the works can not be as complete as they ought, the troops will be there; and a reliance must be had in their bravery, to repel any attempt that may be formed against them.</P>

<P>HEREWITH I do myself the honor to inclose copies of a letter from an officer of militia in Elizabethtown, to me, and an extract of a letter from one of Mr. Boudinot's deputies at Boston, to him,—both tending to induce a belief that the ene∣my have some enterprise in contemplation. What this is, time must discover.—I have this whole winter been clearly of opi∣nion that general Howe's movements would be very early this spring, to take advantage of the weak state of our army,—or late, if he expected considerable reinforcements from England, and meant to avail himself of his full strength. If the first takes place, as appearances indicate, it may, I think, be considered as a proof of one or both of these two things,—that he is either well informed (he cannot indeed be otherwise) of the situation, and more than probably, of the strength of our army,—or that he expects no considerable reinforcements this year from Europe. In either case it is our indispensable duty to re∣inforce and arrange our army as speedily as possible, that we may in the first instance be prepared for defence,—in the second, take advantage of any favorable circumstance which may hap∣pen, to injure the enemy.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the designs of Congress with respect to the establishment of the army, I know not: but I do most earnestly and devoutly recommend a speedy adoption of them, and the appointment of officers, as our present situation at this advanced season is truly alarming, and to me highly distressing, as I am convinced that we shall be plunged into the campaign before our arrangements are made, and the army properly organized.</P>
<P>The numberless disadvantages resulting from the late appoint∣ment of general officers last year, make me look forward with infinite anxiety, this:—for, after all the wisdom that Congress or their committee can use in the choice of officers, many will be disgusted: resignations of some and perhaps non-acceptance of others will follow. Before matters then can be brought to a proper tone, much time will be lost, and a great deal of trou∣ble and vexation encountered,—to overcome which, is not the work of a day: and, till they are overcome, confusion, disorder, and loss, must prevail. In the mean while, order, regularity,
<PB N="205" REF="031423_0501_0FEC5F6D5B589C40"/>
and discipline, which require the vigilance of every officer to establish, and must flow from the general officers in every army,—are neglected, or not entered upon in time, to effect. Thus it happened last year, and brigades and divisions became vacant, to the great injury of the service.</P>
<P>As it is not improper for Congress to have some idea of the present temper of the army, it may not ne amiss to remark in this place, that, since the month of August last, between two and three hundred officers have resigned their commissions, and many others were with difficulty dissuaded from it. In the Vir∣ginia line only, not less than six colonels, as good as any in the service, have left it lately; and more, I am told, are in the hu∣mor to do so.</P>
<P>Highly advantageous also would it be, if the recruits and draughts from North-Carolina and Virginia were not suffered to halt on their way to camp under pretence of getting equip∣ped, but sent forward and incorporated into the different regi∣ments of their respective states as soon as it could be done. Out of the number of men said to be draughted in Virginia last fall, and others from North-Carolina, very few have joined the ar∣my; but, owing to desertion and other causes, they have dwin∣dled to nothing: and this will always be the case with new re∣cruits, especially those who are unwillingly drawn forth, if much time is spent in getting them to their regiments under the care of proper officers. This shews the necessity (if the season and other powerful reasons did not loudly call for it) of hastening them to the army.</P>
<P>My solicitude for the preservation of the communication of the North-river gives me very uneasy sensations on account of our posts there, and will excuse my again asking if the troops to the northward, except such as are necessary for the defence of Fort-Schuyler, can be so advantageously employed as at the works on that river.—A respectable force at those posts would awe New-York, and divide general Howe's force or expose the city.—To depend too much upon militia, is, in my opinion, putting every thing to hazard.</P>
<P>If I should appear uncommonly anxious respecting the seve∣ral matters contained in this letter, by repeating them,—Con∣gress will do me the justice, I hope, to believe that I am actu∣ated by no views but such as are prompted by circumstances and the advanced season.—With the greatest respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I HAVE been honored with yours of the twenty-fifth, inclosing duplicates of two former resolves of Congress, and a resolve of the twenty-third instant, accepting the resignation of colonel Charles Webb.</P>
<P>Since mine of the twenty-fourth, Mr. Boudinot has commu∣nicated the following intelligence, being part of a letter to him:—"I have lately received some intelligence from New-York, that we may make ourselves easy in Jersey, as all the force that can be spared is to be sent to join general Howe.—Two thousand five hundred are actually on board transports, and lying at the watering place."</P>
<P>I have this day received a letter from general Smallwood, dated yesterday at Wilmington, in which he says—"The ene∣my, about four days ago, had a fleet of near fifty sail standing up the river, which I fancy was from New-York; and yester∣day their foraging fleet went up without touching upon this side the Delaware, except three or four small parties about Port-Penn, who have been constantly drove off by a party of about a hundred of our men, who have been guarding and aid∣ing the removal of the forage, which is at length happily ef∣fected."</P>
<P>A Philadelphia paper of the twenty-seventh also mentions, that a fleet of upwards of forty sail had left the Hook on sun∣day, and that they were said to be in the river.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you upon the twen∣ty-ninth ultimo, I have not been able to learn with any preci∣sion whether the transports that arrived brought any considera∣ble number of troops.—A Hessian de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erter says there were only a few German convalescents on board. If so, the fleet with two thousand five hundred, mentioned in my last, is not arrived, supposing they were bound to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>General St. Clair arrived yesterday from Boston: and, as he seems very anxious to have his matter determined one way or the other, I beg leave to recal the attention of Congress to my letter of the twenty-seventh of February upon that subject.—Having received no information since that time which serves to direct my judgment as to the charges which it will be proper to exhibit against general St. Clair, I have only again to re∣quest that Congress or the committee will be pleased to point out the particular charges upon which the court shall proceed.</P>
<P>I could wish this matter might not be delayed; on several ac∣counts. General St. Clair is in a very delicate situation, and feels it sensibly. He was kept inactive great part of last cam∣paign, and probably will be the whole of this, except his trial can be shortly brought on,—as it will be almost impossible to find time to hold a court after the scene of action opens.—If he should be acquitted, he would render very essential service, especially at this time when we have so few general officers: if condemned, his place may be immediately filled. It will besides take him some little time to prepare for his defence after he knows the particular charges alledged against him.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN Lee of the light dragoons, and the officers under his command, having uniformly distinguished themselves by a conduct of exemplary zeal, prudence, and bravery, I took occasion, on a late signal instance of it, to express the high sense I entertained of their merit, and to assure him that it should not fail of being properly noticed. I was induced to give this assurance from a conviction that it is the wish of Con∣gress to give every encouragement to merit, and that they would cheerfully embrace so favorable an opportunity of mani∣festing this disposition.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="031423_0504_0FEC5F7477AFDC00"/>
I had it in contemplation at the time, in case no other me∣thod more eligible could be adopted, to make him an offer of a place in my family. I have consulted the committee of Con∣gress upon the subject, and we were mutually of opinion that the giving captain Lee the command of two troops of horse on the proposed establishment, with the rank of major, to act as an independent partisan corps, would be a mode of rewarding him, very advantageous to the service. Captain Lee's genius par∣ticularly adapts him to a command of this nature; and it will be the most agreeable to him, of any station in which he could be placed.</P>
<P>I beg leave to recommend this measure to Congress, and shall be obliged by their decision as speedily as may be conve∣nient. The campaign is fast approaching, and there will pro∣bably be very little time to raise and prepare the corps for it. It is a part of the plan to give Mr. Lindsay the command of the second troop, and to make Mr. Peyton captain-lieutenant of the first.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now the honor to acknowledge your several letters of the twenty-first, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth ultimo, with their inclosures, which have been duly received.—It gives me pain to observe they appear to contain several implications by which my sensibility is not a little wounded.—I find myself extremely embarrassed by the steps I had taken towards an ex∣change of prisoners and the formation of a general cartel mak∣ing more ample provision for their future accommodation and relief. The views of Congress seem to be very different from what I supposed them when I entered into my late engagements with general Howe: their resolution of the thirtieth ultimo, pointedly requiring a strict adherence to all former ones upon the subject, will in all probability render them impracticable.—I considered some of their resolutions as dictated on the princi∣ple of retaliation, and did not imagine the terms they contain∣ed would be insisted upon in negociating an agreement calcu∣lated to remedy the evil which occasioned them. In most re∣spects they might be substantially complied with: but there are some points to which an exact conformity must of necessity destroy the idea of a cartel. One is the obliging the enemy to pay gold and silver on equal terms for continental curren∣cy,
<PB N="209" REF="031423_0505_0FEC5F33760FB0F0"/>
estimating the articles supplied them at their actual prices with us, as seems to be the design of the resolve of the nine∣teenth of December.—Another is the subjecting the inhabitants of these states, taken in arms against them, to trial and punish∣ment, agreeable to the resolve of the thirtieth of the same month.</P>
<P>I am well aware that appearances ought to be upheld, and that we should avoid as much as possible recognising by any public act the depreciation of our currency; but I conceive this end would be answered as far as might be necessary, by stipulating that all money payments should be made in gold and silver, being the common medium of commerce among na∣tions, at the rate of four shillings and sixpence for a Spanish milled dollars, &amp;c.—by fixing the price of rations on an equi∣table scale relatively to our respective circumstances,—and providing for the payment of what we may owe, by sending in provision, and selling it at their market. The rates of money, and the prices of provisions and other commodities, differ every where: and, in treaties of a similar nature between any two states, it is requisite, for mutual convenience, to ascertain some common ratio both for the value of money in payments, and for the rates of those articles on which they may arise.</P>
<P>It was determined on mature consideration not to conclude any thing expressly that should contradict the resolution of the thirtieth December: but at the same time, if it is designed to be the rule of practice, it is easy to perceive it would at once overturn any cartel that could be formed. General Howe would never consent to observe it on his part, if such a practice were to exist on ours.—Though the law ought not to be con∣travened by an express article admitting the exchangeability of such persons, yet, if it is not suffered to sleep, it is in vain to expect the operation of it will be acquiesced in by the enemy.</P>
<P>The measures I have taken must evince that it is my deter∣mination to pay the fullest attention to the interests of citizens, and to the rights of general Lee, in the treaty: and I think it but justice to the gentlemen appointed to negotiate it, to de∣clare that I know them to be so fully impressed with the im∣portance of both those objects, as to make them cheerfully ob∣servant of the injunctions of Congress, so far as not to conclude any agreement of which the exchange of general Lee and the alternative respecting citizens are not essential parts.—These points had been early determined on.</P>
<P>It is with no small concern that I have been obliged to trou∣ble Congress upon the subjects of this letter: and, should they
<PB N="210" REF="031423_0506_0FEC5F78D0E7E180"/>
appear to them in the same light they do to me, and they should think proper to remove the obstacles which now oppose the business in hand, I must request they will be pleased to communicate their determination as expeditiously as possible, that the commissioners may govern themselves accordingly and either proceed to forming a cartel, or put an end to the nego∣tiation.—Before the resolves of the thirteenth came to hand, they had met, and been in treaty two days, with a prospect of a favorable accommodation.</P>
<P>I am happy to inform Congress that general Lee will be out on parole to-morrow in place of general Prescot: and I have every reason to expect, if the negotiation can be continued up∣on admissible terms, that his exchange will immediately follow the releasement of colonel Campbell and the Hessian field-offi∣cers. It is agreed that lieutenant-colonel Allen shall be ex∣changed for lieutenant-colonel Campbell.</P>
<P>The importunate applications of colonel Lee and major Swazey to leave the service oblige me to lay the matter before Congress. Colonel Lee's letter upon the subject was transmit∣ted me the twenty-fifth of January: but, hoping he might change his mind, I deferred writing to Congress upon his re∣quest. He has renewed it again in urgent terms, through general Heath, and I have only to observe that it is a painful circum∣stance to see officers of their merit leaving the service.—It is the case every day.—I shall be obliged by Congress informing me of the dates of the resignations of the colonels in the Virgi∣nia line:—I have only received the date of colonel Lewis's.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a letter from captain Cotteneau of the ship Fer∣dinand, with an invoice of her cargo. The letter only came to hand yesterday: and, as it is of an old date, it is highly proba∣ble that the goods are sold. If they are not,—from the cap∣tain's desire to give the public a preference in the sale, Con∣gress will have an opportunity of directing them to be purchas∣ed. Most of them would be proper for the army.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had the honor of receiving your favor of the fourth instant, inclosing a resolve of Congress, of the same date, empowering me to call forth five thousand militia from the states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New-Jersey. I thank Congress for the power: at the same time it is incumbent on me to assure them, that,—granting the practicability of collect∣ing such a number,—it would prove a work of time, difficulty, and expense; to evince which, I need only recur to the expe∣rience of last campaign on similar occasions, and to remind you that it was not possible to obtain a thousand men, nor some∣times even one hundred, from this state, although the former number was required and promised, for the purpose of cover∣ing during the winter the country between Schuylkill and De∣laware.</P>
<P>As this resolve appears to have been made in consequence of my letters of the twenty-fourth and twenty-ninth ultimo, which were founded on conjecture, and, in some degree, misinforma∣tion,—and as the execution of it would, exclusive of the incon∣veniences abovementioned, I am persuaded have a tendency to injure the completion of the continental regiments,—I shall call for a small part only of the number allowed; but could wish that Hartley's regiment were ordered immediately to camp, and the duties of it performed by militia. In like manner I would propose that all remote guards should be composed of militia, and that the several purposes for which men are drawn from the continental troops should be answered by them. This would be a means of drawing together a considerable number of men who are in a manner lost to the army, and of employing the militia to the best advantage possible.</P>
<P>The great end of my letter to Congress of the twenty-fourth ultimo, seems to have been mistaken. My views were not turned to reinforcements of militia. To know whether the old establishment of the army, or the new as agreed upon by the committee, is the choice of Congress,—and in what manner the
<PB N="212" REF="031423_0508_0FEC601776B0BB80"/>
regiments of this state and the additionals are to be reduced,—officers for the whole appointed, &amp;c. were my objects. These are objects of the greatest moment, as they may, in their con∣sequences, involve the fate of America; for I will undertake to say, that it is next to impossible, when the season is so far ad∣vanced, properly to accomplish those changes, appointments, and the dependent arrangements for the ensuing campaign. Should any convulsion happen, or movement take place, they will be altogether impracticable.—Justice to my own character, as well as duty to the public, constrain me to repeat these things: their consequences are more easily conceived than described.</P>
<P>It may be said by some, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir, that my wish to see the officers of this army upon a more respectable establishment, is the cause of my solicitude, and carries me too far.—To such I can declare that my anxiety proceeds from the causes abovementioned. If my opinion is asked with respect to the necessity of making this provision for the officers, I am ready to declare that I do most religiously believe the salvation of the cause depends upon it,—and, without it, your officers will moulder to nothing, or be composed of low and illiterate men, void of capacity for this or any other business. To prove this, I can with truth aver, that scarce a day passes, without the offer of one or two commissions; and my advices from the eastward and southward are that num∣bers who had gone home on furlough mean not to return, but are establishing themselves in more lucrative employments.—Let congress determine what will be the consequence of this spirit.</P>
<P>Personally, as an officer, I have no interest in their decision, because I have declared, and I now repeat it, that I never will receive the smallest benefit from the half-pay establishment: but, as a man who fights under the weight of a proscription, and as a citizen who wishes to see the liberty of his country established upon a permanent foundation, and whose property depends up∣on the success of our arms, I am deeply interested. But,—all this apart, and justice out of the question,—upon the single ground of economy and public saving, I will maintain the utili∣ty of it: for I have not the least doubt, that, until officers con∣sider their commissions in an honorable and interested point of view, and are afraid to endanger them by negligence and inat∣tention, no order, regularity, or care either of the men or pub∣lic property, will prevail. * * *</P>
<P>By officers who are just returned from Massachusetts-Bay, I learn that there is not the least prospect of getting men from thence before the month of June,—if then; and indeed that
<PB N="213" REF="031423_0509_0FEC5FAA0FD25E88"/>
there is no reason to expect any number that will deserve the name of reinforcement for the continental regiments this cam∣paign,—the towns being only called upon to furnish the defi∣ciency of their last year's quota, so that all subsequent casualties are disregarded, and the fifteen regiments from that state, which may now perhaps want four thousand men to complete them, will receive only five hundred if the towns came within that number of their complement last year.—What change the re∣quisition of Congress, of the [<HI>twenty-sixth</HI>] of February, may ef∣fect, I shall not undertake to say:—if it has not a speedy and powerful operation, our prospects in that quarter will be ex∣ceedingly unpromising.</P>
<P>A gentleman from New-Hampshire some little time since in∣formed me that matters were nearly in the same train there, notwithstanding a resolve for the completion of their batallions; and the inclosed copy of a letter (No. 1) from general Putnam, whom I have desired to remain in Connecticut for some time in order to forward the recruits from that state, conveys his ideas of what may be expected from thence. What New-York, New-Jersey, and North-Carolina have done or are about to do, I know not.—Pennsylvania and Maryland have tried the effect of voluntary enlistments to little purpose; and the first, in di∣rect contradiction to the most pointed injunctions laid on the officers, have their recruits composed chiefly of deserters, who will embrace the first opportunity of escaping with our arms.—Virginia, it is true, has proceeded to a draught: but the num∣ber, besides being in itself inadequate, has been lessened by de∣sertion; and the deficiency of the regiments, on the other hand, being increased by death and desertion, their strength will pro∣bably fall very far short of the new establishment.</P>
<P>This, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir, is not a flattering picture of our affairs: but the re∣presentation is just; and it is incumbent on me to exhibit it in my own defence, as, notwithstanding all these unfavorable cir∣cumstances,—and what is to me a certain prospect of being plunged into the campaign before the arrangements are made, officers appointed, &amp;c.—great matters, I perceive, are expect∣ed from our activity this spring:—in proportion therefore will the disappointment be felt by those who are the most sanguine. For want of the ratification of Congress, the horse establishment, companies of sappers, provost-marshalsey, &amp;c. &amp;c. (as agreed to by the committee, and recommended to their consideration) are entirely at a stand, at a time when we ought to be deriving be∣nefits from their execution.—In a word, at no period since the commencement of the war have I felt more painful sensations on
<PB N="214" REF="031423_0510_0FEC5F0463417788"/>
account of delay, than at the present, and, urged by them, I have expressed myself without reserve.</P>
<P>By a letter just received from general Weedon, I am inform∣ed of his intention to resign, if general Woodford should be re∣stored to his former rank, which he had not then heard. General Muhlenberg is now balancing on the same point. One, there∣fore, if not two brigadiers, will be wanted for that state.—The disadvantages resulting from the frequent resignations in the Virginia line, the changes of commanding officers to the re∣giments, and other causes equally distressing, have injured that corps beyond conception, and have been the means of reducing very respectable regiments in some instances to a mere handful of men; and this will ever be the case till officers can be fixed by something equivalent to the sacrifice they make. To reason otherwise, and suppose that public virtue alone will enable men to forego the case and comforts of life, to encounter the hard∣ships and dangers of war for a bare subsistence, when their com∣panions and friends are amassing large fortunes,—is viewing hu∣man nature rather as it should be, than as it really is.</P>
<P>The clothier-general of the army, as well as the heads of e∣very other department, should be in camp, near the commander in chief: otherwise it is impossible that the operations of war can be conducted with energy and precision. I wish most sin∣cerely that this,—as not the least essential part of the business settled with the committee,—were decided, and a thorough in∣vestigation were had into the conduct of this department; as it is a matter of universal astonishment that we should be deficient in any article of clothing, when it is commonly asserted that the eastern states alone can furnish materials enough to clothe a hun∣dred thousand men.—If this be a fact, there is a fatal error some∣where, to which may be attributed the death and desertion of thousands.</P>
<P>I shall make no apology for the freedom of this letter.—To inform Congress of such facts as materially affect the service, I conceive to be one great and essential part of my duty to them and myself. My agreement with the committee entitled me to expect upwards of forty thousand continental troops, exclusive of artillery and horse, for the service of the ensuing campaign, including those to be employed in the defence of the North ri∣ver.—Instead of these, what are my prospects?</P>

<P>The negotiation between the commissioners is ended without effecting a cartel; nor do I suppose, from the information I have received on the subject, that there is any good prospect that one will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver be formed, at least for a great while, on a liberal and extensive plan.—A report of the proceedings of the commission∣ers on o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r part, at their several meetings, I take the liberty to inclose.

<P>By postponing my call upon the militia, as mentioned in my last of the tenth, I did not mean to decline it altogether. I did not see the necessity of calling out five thousand for the sole purpose of defence; and, in the present situation of things, I cannot perceive my way sufficiently clear for offensive measures, as I do not know when to expect the recruits from the different states, nor what prospect the commissary has of provision:—as we only get it from hand to mouth, assembling the militia, un∣less for the purpose of defence, should be the last thing done, as they soon become impatient, and are very expensive in the articles of stores, camp utensils, provisions, &amp;c.</P>

more extraordinary and impertinent request, that, through my means, the contents should be communicated to the officers and men of this army. This engine of ministry, from governor Livingston's account, is very industriously circulating copies of these draughts, in obedience to their and his royal mandates.—The letter which I inclose, and a triplicate, came to hand at one time: some future conveyance, it is probable, will present me the duplicate.</P>
<P>I would also take the liberty to inclose you the Evening Post, No. 475, which governor Livingston was so obliging as to send me yesterday. Were we not fully satisfied from our experience, that there are no artifices, no measures too * * * for the ene∣my or their adherents to attempt in order to promote their views, we might be astonished at the daring confidence, in defi∣ance of the opinion of the world, manifested in a publication in this paper, purporting to be a resolution of congress, of the twentieth of February. This proceeding is infamous to the last degree, and calculated to produce the most baneful conse∣quences by exciting an opposition in the people to our draught∣ing system, and embarrassing at least the only probable mode now left us for raising men. I think it of great importance that the forgery should be announced in the most public man∣ner, and am the more induced to this opinion from governor Livingston's account of the disagreeable operation it has had, and is still likely to produce, if not contradicted. If it is, and with a few strictures, I should hope that it would excite in the breasts of all our countrymen, a just and generous contempt of the enemy for such a dirty, wicked proceeding.</P>
<P>I was last night honored with your favor of the eighteenth instant, with the proceedings alluded to.—A general plan of operations for the campaign is indispensably essential to be set∣tled.

I also intended to send a messenger this day to meet general Gates, supposing him to be on his way to Hudson's-river, and to request his call at this camp, that we might enter into a full and free discussion on the point.—Their is not a moment to be delayed in forming some general system, in my opinion; and I only wait the arrival of generals Gates and Mifflin, to summon a council for the purpose.</P>

<P>I shall take measures for distributing the report of the com∣mittee on Lord North's bills, and the resolution of the twenty-third inviting delinquents to return to their allegiance and to the protection of these states. This proceeding appears to me founded in great good policy; and I should hope that it will
<PB N="219" REF="031423_0515_0FEC5F18E34F90E8"/>
be attended with many valuable consequences:—but this can only be proved by the event.</P>
<P>Though I wish most heartily for the aid of general Lee in council and upon every other occasion,—yet, as the time of his return is uncertain, or at least it will be several days before it takes place,—and as it seems to me that there is not a moment to lose in forming some general system for our operations,—I should think it inexpedient for general Gates to delay coming to camp till his arrival. After a plan is digested, there will be a great deal of time expended before things will be in a proper train for execution. The season is fast advancing; and the pe∣riod which may be most favorable for any designs we may form will presently arrive.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to transmit an extract of a letter from ge∣neral Heath, which will shew Congress that he is pressed on all sides for money. Governor Livingston too is apprehensive he will be under embarrassments on account of the purchase of horses in consequence of the recommendation of the committee. Their letter to him by some means has been mislaid in the as∣sembly, and he does not know exactly the mode prescribed for the payment. I cannot inform him myself, or do what perhaps is more necessary,—furnish him with money; and therefore hope that Congress or the committee will.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE extensive ill consequences, arising from a want of uniformity in discipline and manoeuvres throughout the army, have long occasioned me to wish for the establishment of a well-organised inspectorship: and the concurrence of Congress in the same views has induced me to set on foot a temporary institu∣tion, which, from the success that has hitherto attended it, gives me the most flattering expectations, and will, I hope, ob∣tain their approbation.</P>
<P>Baron De Steuben's length of service in the first military school in Europe, and his former rank, pointed him out as a person peculiarly qualified to be at the head of this department. This appeared the least exceptionable way of introducing him into the army, and one that would give him the most ready op∣portunity of displaying his talents. I therefore proposed to
<PB N="220" REF="031423_0516_0FEC5FB7D9973948"/>
him to undertake the office of inspector-general, which he a∣greed to with the greatest cheerfulness, and has performed the duties of it with a zeal and intelligence equal to our wishes. He has two ranks of inspectors under him: the lowest are offi∣cers charged with the inspection of brigades, with the title of brigade-inspectors: the others superintended several of these: they have written instructions relative to their several func∣tions; and the manoeuvres which they are to practise are illustra∣ted by a company which the baron has taken the pains to train himself.</P>
<P>The brigade-inspectors were chosen by the brigadier and the commanding officers of regiments in each brigade. The in∣spectors are lieutenant eolon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls Barber of Jersey, Brooks of Massachusetts, Davis of Virginia, and monsieur Ternant, a French gentleman:—the reason for employing him (apart of his intrinsic merit and abilities) was his possessing the French and English languages equally, which made him a necessary assistant to the Baron de Steuben. He is content to serve without rank, until, after an experiment of his abilities, Congress shall deter∣mine what he is entitled to.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of lieutenant-colonel Fleury in camp, as he was unemployed, and had exercised the office of aid-ma∣jor in France, the Baron proposed to have him employed as an inspector; in which I readily acquiesced, as Congress had given him the rank and pay of lieutenant-colonel.—There may be other foreign officers in continental pay, idle for want of being attached to some corps, of whose services we might avail ourselves this way, which is the only method of disposing of them, unless they could be formed into a distinct corps.</P>
<P>From the extraordinary fatigue and close attention required of the officers employed in the inspectorship, I did not think it amiss to let them entertain hopes that Congress would allow some addition to the pay which they derive from their rank; and I take the liberty of recommending the measure. I would propose twenty dollars, per month for the brigade in∣spectors, and thirty for the inspectors, in addition to their pay in the line.</P>
<P>I should do injustice if I were to be longer silent with re∣gard to the merits of the baron De Steuben. His knowledge of his profession, added to the zeal which he has discovered since he began upon the functions of his office, lead me to con∣sider him as an acquisition to the service, and to recommend him to the attention of Congress. His expectations with re∣gard
<PB N="221" REF="031423_0517_0FEC5FB970FD32E0"/>
to rank extend to that of major-general. His finances, he ingenuously co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resses, will not admit of his serving without the incidental emoluments: and Congress, I presume from his character and their own knowledge of him, will without diffi∣culty gratify him in these particulars.</P>
<P>The baron is sensible that our situation requires a few varia∣tions in the duties of his office from the general practice in Eu∣rope, and particularly that they must necessarily be more com∣prehensive; in which, as well as in his instructions, he has skil∣fully yielded to circumstances.—The success which has hither∣to attended the plan enables me to request with confidence the ratification of Congress, and is, I think, a pledge of the esta∣blishment of a well-combined general system, which insur∣mountable obstacles have hitherto opposed.</P>

<P>I HAVE had the honor to receive your dispatches of the twenty-seventh instant. In compliance with the request of Con∣gress, I shall immediately call upon the officers in the army to take the oath of allegiance and abjuration. This I should have done as soon as the resolution passed, had it not been for the state of the army at that time, and that there were some strong reasons which made it expedient to defer the matter.</P>
<P>My opinion upon the subject of a future provision for the of∣ficers hath been so fully, and, I trust, so necessarily and equita∣bly urged, that I shall not add further respecting it, except my sincere wishes that the establishment was determined on. No∣thing, in my idea, can be more just; and I am certain there is nothing n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re essential:—the present unsettled state of the army is hurtful in the extreme.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the twenty-seventh, I have received au∣thentic information of the sailing of a very large number of transports from Philadelphia,—two hundred, it is said. They went down the Delaware the beginning of the week, light and empty.—I have not been able to learn any thing of their des∣tination; nor can I form a conjecture upon the occasion, that is the least satisfactory.</P>
<P>With infinite pleasure I beg leave to congratulate Congress on the very important and interesting advices brought by the fri∣gate La Sensible.—General M'Dougal and Mr. Deane were so obliging as to transmit me the outlines of the good tidings.
<PB N="222" REF="031423_0518_0FEC5F7CE8E49CD8"/>
As soon as Congress may think it expedient, I shall be happy to have an opportunity of announcing to the army, with the u∣sual ceremony, such parts of the intelligence as may be proper, and sanctioned by authority. I have mentioned the matter to such officers as I have seen; and I believe no event was ever received with more heart-felt joy.</P>

<P>IN a late letter from general Schuyler, I received the proceedings of a board of commissioners for Indian affairs, held at Albany the fifteenth of last month. It appears by them and some other accounts I have seen, that there is but little pros∣pect of succeeding in the plan for engaging a body of Indians from that quarter to serve with this army. The advantage which the enemy possesses over us, in having the means of mak∣ing presents much more liberally than we can, has made a strong impression upon their minds, and seems to be more than a counterbalance for any arguments we can offer to conciliate their attachment. They also appear to be apprehensive for their own safety, and rather to wish for aid and protection from us, than willing to leave their habitations and come to our as∣sistance.</P>
<P>The measure proposed was by way of experiment, as one which might possibly be attended with valuable consequences, and, if it could have been effected without much difficulty, might have been worth a trial. But, as the scheme does not well correspond with their present disposition, and may serve to increase our embarrassments in keeping them even in tolera∣ble
<PB N="223" REF="031423_0519_0FEC5F351580A380"/>
good humour, I am inclined to think it would be most ad∣visable to relinquish the attempt. They may be told of what has happened in Europe, with proper embellishments, and that our affairs are now upon such a footing as to render their aid in the field unnecessary, and that all we require of them is their friendship and good wishes. This and promises of protection may have a powerful and happy effect.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to counteract the temptation held out by the enemy, and to secure the good will of the Indians, who appear to be at least in a state of hesitancy and indecision, if nothing worse. Congress, I am persuaded, will do every thing in their power to promote these desirable ends.</P>

<P>I TAKE the liberty to transmit to Congress a copy of a letter from general Howe, which I received at three o'clock this afternoon. The contents are exceedingly interesting to the unhappy prisoners in his hands. I thought it my duty to forward them immediately; and I must request that Congress will be pleased to inform me as soon as possible, what line of conduct I am to pursue upon this occasion.—The inclosed ex∣tract of a letter from general Smallwood will shew the painful alternative to which the prisoners in Philadelphia will be re∣duced

<P>P. S. As to an equivalent in men for officers, that proposed by his commissioners were too high.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor to receive in due time your several favors of the third, sixth, and ninth instant, with the papers to which they respectively alluded.—After much consideration upon the subject, I have appointed general M'Intosh to com∣mand at Fort-Pitt and in the western country, for which he will set out as soon as he can accommodate his affairs. I part with this gentleman with much reluctance, as I esteem him an officer of great worth and merit, and as I know his services here are and will be materially wanted. His firm disposition and equal justice, his assiduity and good understanding,—added to his being a stranger to all parties in that quarter,—pointed him out as a proper person; and I trust, extensive advantages will be derived, from his command, which I could wish was more agreeable.—He will wait on Congress for their instruc∣tions.</P>
<P>As lieutenant-colonel Southerland, major Agnew, and lieu∣tenant Poe, have only requested to go to Europe on parole, it does not appear to me that I can with propriety apply to gene∣ral Howe for their exchange:—this would imply that they were prisoners of war. Though their exchange is certainly the most desirable mode of release as it would relieve an equal number of our officers from captivity, yet I should be happy if a negotiation for the purpose should commence on their part. Knowing that it would be our interest to exchange all the offi∣cers of general Buygoyne's army if it could be done, I wrote general Heath not long since, to take occasion to mention to them that we should always be willing to accede to any equal
<PB N="225" REF="031423_0521_0FEC5F294C6E8690"/>
propositions for that purpose, and would carefully convey their applications to sir William Howe or the general who might command the British army.—I take the liberty to return their letters, presuming that Congress may incline to give them some answer, either directly, or through general Heath.</P>
<P>In respect to lieutenant-colonel * * *, I do not find that there is any necessity for granting the prayer of his petition: we have already too many officers; and I do not apprehend the interest of the states would be much promoted in his ap∣pointment. If he could make up two or three companies, they would be of prisoners and deserters, who would most assuredly embrace an early opportunity to go off with their arms and clothing. I am disposed to consider him as a man of some ad∣dress and policy, as he is aiming at a confirmation in the line of the army (by obtaining an appointment to a new corps) of the rank which he had as a division quarter-master. Besides the impolicy of augmenting the number of our officers where it is not really essential, such a promotion would give dissatis∣faction; and I suppose there are few officers, if any, who for∣merly commanded Mr. * * * in the line of the army, that would submit to his orders.</P>
<P>The inclosed copy of a letter from general Dickinson to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will inform Congress of the fate of the continental frigates in Delaware,—a fate (in the situation they were left) I had long predicted, and which I had taken much pains to avert, by using every argument in my power to have them sunk. In that case, their destruction would have been at least a work of time, diffi∣culty and expense, and might have been perhaps prevented.—About one o'clock on thursday I got notice of an intended move of the enemy by water; and, conjecturing the destination of it, had a detachment under general Maxwell (whose tour of duty it was) ready to march towards the Delaware by four o'clock: but a heavy rain prevented their moving till next morning.</P>
<P>I have been happy in the exchange, and a visit from lieute∣nant-colonel Allen. His fortitude and firmness seem to have placed him out of the reach of misfortune. There is an origi∣nal something in him that commands admiration; and his long captivity and sufferings have only served to increase if possible his enthusiastic zeal.—He appears very desirous of rendering his services to the states, and of being employed, and at the same time does not discover any ambition for high rank.—Congress will herewith receive a letter from him; and I doubt
<PB N="226" REF="031423_0522_0FEC5FBC2B627DB8"/>
not they will make such provision for him as they may think proper and suitable.</P>
<P>I take pleasure in transmitting a Philadelphia paper of the ninth, which came to hand yesterday evening, containing a message from his most christian majesty to the court of London in consequence of the treaty between him and these states,—and his Britannic majesty's address to the lords and commons, &amp;c.—The message is received in terms of irony and derision, more degrading to the pride and dignity of Britain than any thing she has ever experienced since she has been a nation.

<P>I HAVE been honored with your two favors of the ele∣venth and fifteenth instant, with the several papers alluded to, the former by monsieur Jemat, the latter by express yesterday. Colonel Johnson set out on saturday afternoon to wait on Con∣gress upon the subject of his appointment, and, I presume, will be at York to-day.</P>
<P>I shall announce the resolution of the fifteenth to the army, and would flatter myself it will quiet in a great measure the uneasiness which have been so extremely distressing, and pre∣vent resignations, which had proceeded, and were likely to be at such a height, as to destroy our whole military system. It has experienced no inconsiderable shock, particularly in the line of some states, from the loss of several very valuable offi∣cers.</P>
<P>The letter and brevet for colonel Allen I will transmit by the first opportunity.—He left camp eight days ago.</P>
<P>From a variety of concurring circumstances, and the uniform report of persons who have left Philadelphia within four days past, it would appear that the enemy mean to evacuate the ci∣ty. It is said they have already embarked a part of their heavy cannon and baggage,—that transports are fitted and fitting for their horse, and taking in hay. The accounts further add that there has been a press for some nights in the city, and several men obtained in this way, and carried aboard ship; also that there has been an increased number of vendues. These cir∣cumstances
<PB N="227" REF="031423_0523_0FEC5FA2718DE9C0"/>
all indicate an evacuation: but I have not been able to learn the objects of their future operations.—I wrote to ge∣neral Gates yesterday upon the subject, that he may be prepar∣ed in the best manner the situation of things will admit, in case they should be destined for the North-river,—and desired him to retain for the present all the eastern recruits intended for this army.</P>
<P>The quarter-master-general and commissary of provisions are directed to use every possible exertion for putting the affairs of their departments in a train to facilitate a movement in case it should be necessary. But such have been the derangements and disorders in them, that we must be greatly embarrassed for a considerable time yet.</P>
<P>A valuable detachment, under the command of the marquis Fayette, marched this morning, which is intended to move be∣tween the Delaware and Schuylkill, for restraining the enemy's parties, procuring intelligence, and to act as circumstance may require.</P>
<P>I cannot help feeling for the prisoners in possession of the enemy. If they evacuate Philadelphia, those unhappy men will be dragged away with them, and perhaps to a more miser∣able confinement. But, supposing that their future treatment should not be worse, or even that it should be more comforta∣ble than their past,—the idea of being removed farther from their friends, and farther from relief, must distress them to the last degree.</P>

Our condition, for want of the latter, and blankets, is quite painful—of the former, very distressing. The doctors attribute in a great degree the loss of hundreds of lives by the scarcity of clothing; and I am certain hundreds have deserted from the same cause.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the twenty-fourth instant, nothing material has happened. The enemy are still in Philadelphia: but the intelligence from thence is so clear and so strong, that it is certain, or nearly as much so as any event can be that is contingent, that they mean to abandon it. Against the various measures they are pursuing, which point to an evacuation, there is but one single circumstance op∣posed that I can learn, which is, that they are working at their redoubts with great industry. But this fact, though certainly true, cannot be of sufficient weight to raise a doubt upon the subject, and must be considered as merely calculated to deceive us, and to mask their design.</P>
<P>We cannot find out, notwithstanding the most diligent pains, whether their movement will be by land or sea; nor are the in∣habitants of the town satisfied on the point.—Appearances fa∣vor either.—They have a great many ships, and very large: yet, from a preparation of boats at Prince's-bay on the south side of Staten-Island which I am just advised of, and for some other reasons, a land route is not improbable.</P>

<P><HI>June</HI> 1.—I should be glad to know, in case Philadelphia is evacuated, whether any and what line of conduct is to be pur∣sued respecting the goods that may be left.—Such articles as come under the denomination of public stores will of course be taken by the proper officers for the use of the states.—The point on which I wish directions is with respect to goods and merchandise, private property. I do not know whether any considerable quantity may be left: but it has been suggested; that, from an expectation of the sort, there are some bringing into light their gold and silver for the purpose of buying-up.—If there should be clothing suitable for the army, perhaps there might be nothing unjust in the public's taking the preference, and Congress appointing one or two intelligent active persons of address, acquainted with the city and with those who have the goods, with proper powers to purchase them.</P>
<P>Whatever measure may be thought expedient, it will be ne∣cessary to adopt it as early as possible, as the evacuation will probably take place in a short time. Robert Morris, esquire, I should imagine, if the purchasing scheme is determined on, will be able to point out proper persons.

artisans with large quantities of goods, will be forced from Philadelphia, who otherwise would willingly remain. From report, their reluctance and distress upon this occasion are scarcely to be paralelled.—There are a few whose conduct has been such, that no assurances of security, I presume, could in∣duce them to stay: and their departure, compelled and founded as it were in the approbation of their own consciences, would answer all the purposes of example, especially if followed by a confiscation of property.—A proscribing system, or laws having the same effect, when carried to a great extent, ever appeared to me to be impolitic: and their operation should always cease with the causes which produced them. Examples in terrorem are necessary: but to exile many of its inhabitants cannot be the interest of any state.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you this forenoon, I received your letter of the seventeenth, with its several inclo∣sures.—I am happy in the approbation of Congress respecting my conduct to doctor Ferguson. I could not find, after the ma∣turest consideration on the subject, that his passage through the country could be in any wise material, or answer any other pur∣pose than to spread disaffection.</P>
<P>I shall take every measure in my power to prevent an inter∣course between the army and the enemy, and also between the inhabitants and the latter. You may rest assured that whatever letters come from their lines shall be, as they ever have been, minutely inspected; and whenever they import any thing of an insidious cast, they shall be suppressed. In this I trust I shall not offend against any rule of right, nor the strictest propriety.</P>
<P>The letter for the commissioners I shall transmit by the earliest opportunity: however, their departure from Philadelphia will prevent their getting it as soon as they otherwise would have done.—I cannot say that I regret the delay: for there is no knowing to what acts of depredation and ruin their disappointed ambition might have led. And permit me to add that I think there was no other criterion for Congress to go by, than the one
<PB N="235" REF="031423_0531_0FEC5F21CD7A60E0"/>
they have adopted. The proceedings of the twenty-second of April, it is probable, have reached, Britain by this time, and will shew that the present powers of the commissioners,—or at least those we are obliged to suppose them to possess,—are whol∣ly incompatible to any valuable end.</P>
<P>I have appointed general Arnold to command in Philadel∣phia, as the state of his wound will not permit his services in a more active line. Colonel Jackson, with a detachment of troops, is to attend him▪ and I flatter myself that order will be pre∣served, and the several purposes answered, expressed by Congress in their resolution of the fourth instant.—The general set out this evening, and I myself shall move with the main body of the army at five in the morning to-morrow.</P>

<P>THE baron Steuben will have the honor to deliver you this. I do not know particularly the extent of his business at York; but, from what he has communicated, it is in part to get the duties and powers of his appointment minutely defined and settled. I inclose a copy of orders on the fifteenth instant, which were issued to quiet the minds of the general officers, and to remove a spirit of jealousy which but too apparently was ris∣ing among them. These contain my ideas of the principal du∣ties of the inspector's office, and, I have reason to think, are ge∣nerally agreeable to the army. While I am on this subject, I must do justice to the baron's intelligence, zeal, and indefatiga∣ble industry, from which we have experienced very happy ef∣fects.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter I transmit at the request of captain Gibbs; and I wish to recommend him to the consideration of Congress. He has been in the army from the commencement of the war, and in the capacities he mentions. When Congress were pleas∣ed to honor me with the appointment of officers for the sixteen additional batallions, I offered to make some provision for him; but this he declined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he commanded originally consisted of fifty men: but, since the arrival of baron Steuben, it has been augmented to a hundred and fifty. He advised that there should be a select corps
<PB N="236" REF="031423_0532_0FEC602C003786D8"/>
of this number to receive the manoeuvres in the first instance, and to act as a model to the army; and proposed that it should be formed of the old guard company and draughts from the line. I presume,—if it should be Congress's pleasure,—that a majori∣ty would be highly agreeable to the captain, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as much as he expects.</P>

<P>I WAS duly honored with your favor of the twentieth instant, with the report to which it referred, and trust my situ∣ation will apologise for my not answering it before.</P>
<P>I am now here with the main body of the army, and pressing hard to come up with the enemy. They encamped yesterday at Monmouth court-house, having almost the whole of their front, particularly their left wing, secured by a marsh and thick wood, and their rear by a difficult defile, from whence they moved very early this morning.—Our advance, from the rainy weather, and the intense heat when fair, (though these may have been equally disadvantageous to them) has been greatly delay∣ed. Several of our men have fallen sick from these causes; and a few unfortunately have fainted, and died in a little time after.</P>
<P>We have a select and strong detachment more forward, un∣der the command of major-general Lee, with orders to attack their rear if possible. Whether the detachment will be able to come up with it, is a matter of question, especially before they get into strong grounds. Besides this, Morgan, with his corps, and some bodies of militia, are on their flanks.</P>
<P>I cannot determine yet at what place they intend to embark. Some think they will push for Sandy-hook, whilst others suppose they mean to go to Shoal-harbor. The latter opinion seems to be founded in the greater probability, as, from intelligence, se∣veral vessels and craft are lying off that place.</P>
<P>We have made a few prisoners; and they have lost a good many men by desertion. I cannot ascertain their number, as they came in to our advanced parties, and pushed immediately into the country. I think five or six hundred is the least num∣ber that have come in, in the whole. They are chiefly fo∣reigners.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I EMBRACE the first moment of leisure to give Con∣gress a more full and particular account of the movements of the army under my command since its passing the Delaware, than the situation of our affairs would heretofore permit.</P>
<P>I had the honor to advise them; that, on the appearances of the enemy's intention to march through Jersey becoming seri∣ous, I had detached general Maxwell's brigade in conjunction with the militia of that state to interrupt and impede their pro∣gress by every obstruction in their power, so as to give time to the army under my command to come up with them, and take advantage of any favorable circumstances that might present themselves. The army having proceeded to Coryel's ferry, and crossed the Delaware at that place, I immediately detached colonel Morgan with a select corps of six hundred men to rein∣force general Maxwell, and marched with the main body to∣wards Princeton.</P>
<P>The flow advance of the enemy had greatly the air of design; and led me, with others, to suspect that general Clinton, desi∣rous of a general action, was endeavouring to draw us down into the lower country, in order, by a rapid movement, to gain our right, and take possession of the strong grounds above us.—This consideration, and to give the troops time to repose and refresh themselves from the fatigues they had experienced from rainy and excessive hot weather, determined me to halt at Hope∣well township, about five miles from Princeton, where we re∣mained till the morning of the twenty fifth.</P>
<P>On the preceding day I made a second detachment of fifteen hundred chosen troops under brigadier-general Scott, to rein∣force those already in the vicinity of the enemy, the more ef∣fectually to annoy and delay their march. The next day the army moved to Kingston; and, having received intelligence that the enemy were prosecuting their route towards Monmouth
<PB N="240" REF="031423_0536_0FEC604A404DCDF8"/>
court-house, I dispatched a thousand select men under brigadier∣general Wayne, and sent the marquis De la Fayette to take the command of the whole advanced corps, including Maxwell's brigade and Morgan's light infantry, with orders to take the first fair opportunity of attacking the enemy's rear.</P>
<P>In the evening of the same day, the whole army marched from Kingston, where our baggage was left, with intention to pre∣serve a proper distance for supporting the advanced corps, and arrived at Cranberry early the next morning. The intense heat of the weather, and a heavy storm unluckily coming on, made it impossible to resume our march that day without great inconve∣nience and injury to the troops. Our advanced corps, being differently circumstanced, moved from the position it had held the night before, and took post in the evening on the Monmouth road, about five miles from the enemy's rear, in expectation of attacking them next morning on their march.—The main body having remained at Cranberry, the advanced corps was found to be too remote, and too far upon the right, to be supported in case of an attack either upon or from the enemy; which in∣duced me to send orders to the marquis to file off by his left towards Englishtown, which he accordingly executed early in the morning of the twenty-seventh.</P>
<P>The enemy, in marching from Allentown, had changed their disposition, and placed their best troops in the rear, consisting of all the grenadiers, light infantry, and cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seurs of the line.—This alteration made it necessary to increase the number of our advanced-corps; in consequence of which I detached major-ge∣neral Lee with two brigades to join the marquis at Englishtown, on whom of course the command of the whole devolved, amount∣ing to about five thousand men. The main body marched the same day, and encamped within three miles of that place. Mor∣gan's corps was left hovering on the enemy's right flank; and the Jersey militia, amounting at this time to about seven or eight hundred men, under general Dickinson, on their left.</P>
<P>The enemy were now encamped in a strong position, with their right extending about a mile and a half beyond the court-house in the parting of the roads leading to Shrewsbury and Middletown, and their left along the road from Allentown to Monmouth, about three miles on this side the court-house. Their right flank lay on the skirt of a small wood, while their left was secured by a very thick one,—a morass running towards their rear, and their whole front covered by a wood, and, for a considerable extent towards the left, with a morass.—In this situation they halted till the morning of the twenty-eighth.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="031423_0537_0FEC5FCE38CEBD68"/>
Matters being thus situated,—and having had the best inform∣ation, that, if the enemy were once arrived at the heights of Middletown, ten or twelve miles from where they were, it would be impossible to attempt any thing against them with a prospect of success,—I determined to attack their rear the moment they should get in motion from their present ground. I communi∣cated my intention to general Lee, and ordered him to make his disposition for the attack, and to keep his troops constantly lying upon their arms, to be in readiness at the shortest notice. This was done with respect to the troops under my immediate command.</P>
<P>About five in the morning, general Dickinson sent an express informing that the front of the enemy had begun their march. I instantly put the army in motion, and sent orders by one of my aids to general Lee to move on and attack them unless there should be very powerful reasons to the contrary,—acquainting him at the same time, that I was marching to support him, and, for doing it with the greater expedition and convenience, should make the men disencumber themselves of their packs and blan∣kets.</P>
<P>After marching about five miles, to my great surprise and mortification, I met the whole advanced corps retreating,—and, as I was told, by general Lee's orders,—without having made any opposition, except one fire, given by a party under the com∣mand of colonel Butler, on their being charged by the enemy's cavalry, who were repulsed.—I proceeded immediately to the rear of the corps, which I found closely pressed by the enemy, and gave directions for forming part of the retreating troops, who, by the brave and spirited conduct of the officers, aided by some pieces of well-served artillery, checked the enemy's ad∣vance, and gave time to make a disposition of the left wing and second line of the army upon an eminence, and in a wood a lit∣tle in the rear, covered by a morass in front. On this were placed some batteries of cannon by lord Stirling who command∣ed the left wing, which played upon the enemy with great ef∣fect, and, seconded by parties of infantry detached to oppose them, effectually put a stop to their advance.</P>
<P>General Lee being detached with the advanced corps, the command of the right wing, for the occasion, was given to ge∣neral Greene. For the expedition of the march, and to coun∣teract any attempt to turn our right, I had ordered him to file off by the new church, two miles from Englishtown, and fall into the Monmouth road, a small distance in the rear of the court-house, while the rest of the column moved directly on towards
<PB N="242" REF="031423_0538_0FEC5F83D26F5088"/>
the court-house. On intelligence of the retreat, he marched up and took a very advantageous position on the right.</P>
<P>The enemy, by this time, finding themselves warmly opposed in front, made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n attempt to turn our left flank; but they were bravely repulsed and driven back by detached parties of infant∣ry. They also made a movement to our right with as little suc∣cess, general Greene having advanced a body of troops with ar∣tillery to a commanding piece of ground; which not only disap∣pointed their design of turning our right, but severely enfiladed those in front of the left wing.—In addition to this, general Wayne advanced with a body of troops, and kept up so severe and well-directed a fire, that the enemy were soon compelled to retire behind the defile where the first stand in the beginning of the action had been made.</P>
<P>In this situation the enemy had both their flanks secured by thick woods and morasses, while their front could only be ap∣proached thro' a narrow pass. I resolved nevertheless to attack them; and, for that purpose, ordered general Poor, with his own and the Carolina brigade, to move round upon their right, and general Woodford upon their left, and the artillery to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them in front. But the impediments in their way prevented their getting within reach before it was dark. They remained upon the ground they had been directed to occupy during the night, with intention to begin the attack early the next morn∣ing; and the army continued lying upon their arms in the field of action, to be in readiness to support them.</P>
<P>In the mean time the enemy were employed in removing their wounded, and about twelve o'clock at night marched away in such silence, that, though general Poor lay extremely near them, they effected their retreat without his knowledge. They carried off all their wounded, except four officers and about forty privates whose wounds were too dangerous to permit their removal.</P>
<P>The extreme heat of the weather, the fatigue of the men from their march through a deep sandy country almost entirely desti∣tute of water, and the distance the enemy had gained by march∣ing in the night, made a pursuit impracticable and fruitless: it would have answered no valuable purpose, and would have been fatal to numbers of our men, several of whom died the preced∣ing day with heat.</P>
<P>Were I to conclude my account of this day's transactions without expressing my obligations to the officers of the army in general, I should do injustice to their merit, and violence to my own feelings. They seemed to vie with each other in manifest∣ing
<PB N="243" REF="031423_0539_0FEC5F8A182CB880"/>
their zeal and bravery. The catalogue of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose who dis∣tinguished themselves is too long to admit of particularising in∣dividuals. I cannot, however, forbear mentioning brigadier-general Wayne, whose good conduct and bravery through the whole action deserves particular commendation.</P>
<P>The behaviour of the troops in general, after they recovered from the first surprise occasioned by the retreat of the advanced corps, was such as could not be surpassed.—All the artillery, both officers and men, that were engaged, distinguished them∣selves in a remarkable manner.</P>
<P>Inclosed, Congress will be pleased to receive a return of our killed, wounded, and missing. Among the first were lieu∣tenant colonel Bunner of Pennsylvania, and major Dickinson of Virginia, both officers of distinguished merit, and much to be regretted.—The enemy's slain, left on the field, and buried by us, according to the return of the persons assigned to that duty, were four officers and two hundred and forty-five privates. In the former number was the honorable colonel Monckton. Ex∣clusive of these, they buried some themselves, as there were se∣veral new graves near the field of battle.—How many men they may have had wounded, cannot be determined: but, from the usual proportion, the number must have been considerable.—There were a few prison<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs taken.</P>
<P>The peculiar situation of general Lee at this time requires that I should say nothing of his conduct. He is now in arrest. The charges against him, with such sentence as the court-mar∣tial may decree in his ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, shall be transmitted for the ap∣probation or disapprobation of Congress, as soon as it shall be passed.</P>
<P>Being fully convinced by the gentlemen of this country that the enemy cannot be hurt or injured in their embarkation at Sandy-Hook, the place to which they are going,—and unwil∣ling to get too far removed from the North-river,—I put the troops in motion early this morning, and shall proceed that way, leaving the Jersey brigade, Morgan's corps, and other light parties (the militia being all dismissed), to hover about them, to countenance desertion, and to prevent their depreda∣tions as far as possible.—After they embark, the former will take post in the neighborhood of Elizabethtown, the latter re∣join the corps from which they were detached.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, on sunday morn∣ing, the left wing of the army moved towards the North-river; the right followed yesterday; and the second line, which forms the rear division, is also now in motion. I shall advance as fast as I can consistently with the circumstances of the weather and the health of the troops.</P>
<P>The enemy, from the advices of our parties of observation, were nearly if not all embarked yesterday. They have conti∣nued to desert upon all occasions.</P>
<P>I should be extremely happy if the committee appointed to arrange the army would repair to it as soon as possible. Con∣gress can form no adequate idea of the discontents prevailing on account of the unsettled state of rank, and the uncertainty in which officers are as to their future situation. The variety of hands in which the power of granting commissions and filling up vacancies is lodged,—and other circumstances,—have occasion∣ed frequent instances of younger officers commanding their se∣niors, from the former having received their commissions, and the latter not,—and these, not only in the line of the army at large, but in their own brigades, and even in their own regi∣ments.—This, it will be readily conceived, is necessarily pro∣ductive of much confusion, altercation and complaint, and re∣quires the speediest remedy.</P>

<P>ON friday evening, I had the honor to receive your let∣ter of the seventh instant, with its inclosures.—The vote of ap∣probation and thanks, which Congress have been pleased to ho∣nor me with, gives me the highest satisfaction, and at the same time demands a return of my sincerest acknowledgments.—The other resolution I communicated with great pleasure to the army at large in yesterday's orders.</P>
<P>The left wing of the army, which advanced yesterday four miles beyond this, moved this morning on the route towards King's ferry. The right, and second line, which makes the last division, are now here, where they will halt for a day or

<P>We have had it reported for two or three days through se∣veral channels from New-York, that there is a French fleet on the coast: and it is added that the enemy have been manning with the utmost dispatch several of their ships of war which were there, and have pushed them out to sea.—How far these facts are true, I cannot determine: but I should think it of in∣finite importance to ascertain the first, if possible, by sending out swift-sailing cruisers.

<P>I HAD the honor yesterday evening of receiving your very important favor of the tenth instant.—Colonel Laurens, one of my aids, will set out this morning with a letter to the French admiral, the count D'Estaing, inclosing a copy of yours and such other information as I have been able to collect. Its further purpose is for the establishing a convention of signals in case of co-operation, or to convey him such knowledge of the enemy's naval force and position, as may from time to time come under our cognisance.</P>
<P>It appears by intelligence of to-day that the count D'Es∣taing is off or near Sandy-Hook, having already seized several fishing boats on the banks, in order to procure information and pilots.</P>
<P>The army is in motion, and will cross the North-river with all convenient dispatch, where I shall pursue such measures as may appear best calculated for improving the present conjunc∣ture.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the four∣teenth I have been favored with your letters of the eleventh
<PB N="246" REF="031423_0542_0FEC60602A09CF70"/>
and seventeenth, with their respective inclosures. The next morning after the receipt of the former which came to hand on the seventeenth, I dispatched lieutenant colonel Hamilton, ano∣ther of my aids, with the best pilots and the most skilful ma∣sters of ships I could procure, to admiral count D'Estaing, to converse with him more fully on the subject of his opera∣tions, than I was able to direct lieutenant-colonel Laurens to do for want of the information which I afterwards obtained from major Chouin, and a knowledge in several other points besides.</P>
<P>On sunday night Mr. Laurens returned; and I found by him that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the count's first wish to enter at Sandy-Hook, in order to possess himself of, or to destroy if possible, the whole of the British fleet lying in the bay of New-York; and that, for this purpose, he had been much engaged in his inqui∣ries about the depth of water, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounding the channel to ascertain it; the result of which was, that the water, from the experiments made, was too shallow at the entrance to admit his large ships,—or, if they could be got in, it appeared that it would not be without a great deal of difficulty and risk. Af∣ter this disappointment, the next important object which seem∣ed to present itself was an attempt against Rhode-Island, which the count inclined to make (unless I should advise the contra∣ry) as soon as the Chimère frigate, which had carried his excellency monsieur Girard into the Delaware, should rejoin him.</P>
<P>Lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who was well informed of our situation and of my sentiments on every point, was instructed to give the admiral a full and accurate state of facts, and to acquaint him what aid, and how far we could co-operate with him in case of an attempt either against New-York or Rhode-Island; and also to obtain his ideas of the plan and system which he might think ought to be pursued, and to agree with him on certain signals.</P>
<P>Previous to my dispatching Mr. Hamilton, from the in∣formation I received on my enquiries respecting the navigation at the Hook, I was led to suspect (however interesting and desirable the destruction or capture of the British fleet might be) that it was not sufficient to introduce the count's ships. Under this apprehension, I wrote general Sullivan on the se∣venteenth by express, that an expedition might take place in a short time against Rhode-Island, and urged him at the same, time to apply to the states of Massachusetts, Rhode-Island and Connecticut, for as many men as would augment his force
<PB N="247" REF="031423_0543_0FEC5FD12B1A0308"/>
to five thousand, and also to make every possible preparation of boast; provision, pilots, &amp;c. as if the event was fixed and certain.</P>
<P>From this time till about twelve o'clock on sunday, the troops continued passing the river, when I crossed with the last division. On monday afternoon I arrived at this place, in the neighborhood of which, the right and left wing encamped that night, with the second line a few miles in their rear. And here I am happy to add that their passage across the river was effected without any accident, or without any more delay than necessarily attended the work.</P>
<P>Being persuaded now from the conversation which I have had with several pilots and masters of vessels, of character, as well as from the accounts of other gentlemen, and colonel Laurens's report on his return, that the passing of the count's ships by the Hook would be extremely precarious, if not im∣practicable,—I determined yesterday (which was as soon as it could be done), without waiting for further intelligence upon the subject, to put two brigades under marching orders. They accordingly marched this morning at two o'clock, for Rhode-Island, under the particular command of generals Varnum and Glover respectively, and both under the direction, for the pre∣sent, of the marquis De la Fayette. A water conveyance was thought of, and wished for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase of the troops: but, on con∣sideration of all circumstances, such as the difficulty of provid∣ing vessels, the change and precarlousness of the winds, the risk from the enemy's ships, &amp;c. their route by land was deemed by far the more eligible.—The force with general Sullivan, from the best and latest advice I have been able to obtain, is about three thousand.—A detachment under colonel Jackson will follow Varnum's and Glover's brigades.</P>
<P>The inclosed papers, No. 1, respecting eight persons sent from Bennington, and ordered into the enemy's lines, came to hand yesterday. About the same time I received a letter from governor Clinton, containing a petition by the prisoners, and a letter from the committee of Albany, all remonstrating against the proceeding. As this is a matter in which I have no autho∣rity to act, nor in which I would wish to intermeddle, I take the liberty of referring it to Congress that they may decide up∣on it.—The prisoners are at West-Point, and ordered to be de∣tained there for the present.</P>
<P>I would also take the liberty of transmitting to Congress a letter from captain Gibbs, and of recommending him to their consideration. His letter was to have been sent by the baron
<PB N="248" REF="031423_0544_0FEC6065CC579F48"/>
Steuben before we marched from Valley-Forge: but his de∣clining to go to Yorktown at that time, and our move through the Jerseys, delayed its being done. The captain has been in the army from the commencement of the war, and in the capa∣cities which he mentions.—When Congress were pleased to ho∣nor me with the appointment of officers for the sixteen addition∣al battalions, I offered to make some provision for him: but this he declined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he originally commanded consisted of fifty men; but, since the arrival of baron Steuben, it has been augmented to a hundred and fifty. The baron advised that there should be a select corps of this number, to receive the manoeuvres in the first instance, and to act as a model to the army; and proposed that it should be formed of the old guard company, and draughts from the line.—I presume, if it should be Congress's pleasure, a majority would be highly acceptable to the captain, and that it is as much as he expects.</P>
<P><HI>Eleven o'clock, P. M.</HI>—I this moment received a letter from colonel Hamilton, who is on his return to the army, dated the twentieth at Black-point. He informs that the count D'Esta∣ing would sail the next evening for Rhode-Island, being con∣vinced from actual soundings that he could not enter his ships. He was anxiously waiting the arrival of the Chimère, but, at all events, meant to sail at the time he mentions. The admiral has agreed on signals with Mr. Hamilton.—Immediately after this letter came to hand, my aid, Mr. Laurens, set out for Pro∣vidence, having many things to communicate to general Sullivan upon the subject of his co-operation, which neither time nor propriety would suffer me to commit to paper. General Sulli∣van is directed not to confine the number of his troops to five thousand, but to augment it, if he shall judge it necessary to in∣sure his success.</P>
<P>I was informed by Mr. Laurens, that the count D'Estaing's magazine of bread is not so large as he could wish, and that in the course of a few weeks he shall be in want. This circum∣stance I thought it right to mention: and I should suppose that any quantity of biscuit may be provided in a little time at Phi∣ladelphia.</P>
<P>The inclosures, No. 2, are copies of three letters from myself to the admiral.—I flatter myself that the present of stock which I directed for him on his first arrival, in behalf of the states, will be approved by Congress.</P>
<P>The accounts from the western frontiers of Tryon county are distressing. The spirit of the savages seems to be roused, and
<PB N="249" REF="031423_0545_0FEC5FD99E124DA0"/>
they appear determined on mischief and havoc in every quar∣ter.—By a letter from governor Clinton, of the twenty-first, they have destroyed Springfield and Andreas town, and are marching towards the settlements on the west branch of the Delaware. These incursions are extremely embarrassing to our other affairs, and I think, will justify a conclusion that sir Hen∣ry Clinton's intention was to operate up the North-river.—Whether it may have changed with circumstances cannot be determined.</P>
<P>I have detached the fourth Pennsylvania regiment and the remains of Morgan's corps, under lieutenant-colonel Butler, and also colonel Graham with a York state regiment, to co-operate with the militia, and to check the Indians, if possible. Colonel Butler is an enterprising good officer, and well ac∣quainted with the savage mode of warfare: and I am persuaded whatever comes within the compass of his force and abilities, will be done.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE baron De Steuben will have the honor of deliver∣ing you this. I am extremely sorry that this gentleman's situa∣tion and views seem to have determined him to quit the service, in which he has been heretofore and is capable still of being extensively useful. Some discontents, which arose among the officers on account of the powers with which the office was at first vested, induced me to arrange the duties of it upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> different from that on which it began. The moving state of the army has for some time past, in a great degree, suspended the exercise of the inspectorate. When the troops marched from Brunswic, the scarcity of general officers,—most of them being engaged with the court-martial either as members or witnesses,—occasioned my giving the baron a temporary com∣mand of a division during the march. On our arrival near our present encampment, I intended he should relinquish this charge, and resume his former office, for which purpose a ge∣neral order was accordingly issued. But I find that he is en∣tirely disinclined to the measure, and resolves not to continue in the service unless he can hold an actual command in the line.</P>
<P>Justice concurring with inclination constrains me to testify that the baron has in every instance discharged the several
<PB N="250" REF="031423_0546_0FEC603179389EE0"/>
trusts reposed in him with great zeal and ability, so as to give him the fullest title to my esteem, as a brave, indefatigable, judicious, and experienced officer.—I regret there should be a necessity that his services should be lost to the army: at the same time I think it my duty explicitly to observe to Congress, that his desire of having an actual and permanent command in the line cannot be complied with, without wounding the feel∣ings of a number of officers whose rank and merits give them every claim to attention; and that the doing it would be pro∣ductive of much dissatisfaction and extensive ill consequences. This does not proceed from any personal objections on the part of those officers against the baron:—on the contrary, most of them, whom I have heard speak of him, express a high sense of his military worth. It proceeds from motives of another na∣ture, which are too obvious to need particular explanation, or may be summed up in this, that they conceive such a step would be injurious to their essential rights and just expectations.—That this would be their way of thinking upon the subject, I am fully convinced, from the effect which the temporary com∣mand given him, even under circumstances so peculiar as those I have mentioned, produced:—the strongest symptoms of dis∣content appeared upon the occasion.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honor of transmitting to Congress a co∣py of a letter from general Knox, and of sundry observations and remarks on the ordnance establishment of the eleventh of February, which I received about the time we marched from
<PB N="251" REF="031423_0547_0FEC60332E8F72E8"/>
Valley-Forge. These would have been transmitted before, had it not been for the moving state of the army, and a variety of other objects which engrossed my attention.—We have found by experience that some inconveniences have resulted from the establishment, which I conceive have proceeded principally from the total independence of the commissary-general of mili∣tary stores on the commanding officer of artillery. It seems some alterations are necessary: and what they shall be, Con∣gress will be pleased to determine.</P>
<P>It is not without reluctance that I am constrained to renew my importunities on the subject of the committee of arrange∣ment. The present unsettled state of the army is productive of so much dissatisfaction and confusion, and of such a variety of disputes, that almost the whole of my time is now employed in finding temporary and inadequate expedients to quiet the minds of the officers, and keep business on a tolerable sort of footing. Not an hour passes without new applications and new com∣plaints about rank: and, for want of a proper adjustment of this and many other essential points, our affairs are in a most irksome and injurious train. We can scarcely form a court-martial or parade a detachment in any instance, without a warm discussion on the subject of precedence; and there are several good officers now who are forced to decline duty, to prevent disputes, and their being commanded by others who upon eve∣ry principle are their inferiors, unless their having obtained commissions before them (from the opportunities they had of making earlier applications, from local circumstances) should be considered sufficient to give them a superior claim.—There are many other causes of dissatisfaction on this head: but I will not enter into a minute relation of them. I sincerely wish that the gentlemen appointed, or such others as Congress may think proper to nominate for the occasion, would immediately repair to camp:—the present opportunity is favorable for reducing matters to system and order; and, from painful experience, I know there is an absolute necessity for it.</P>
<P>I should also hope that Congress will excuse me for mention∣ing again the necessity there is for appointing some brigadiers. The Massachusetts, by the resignation of general Learned, wants one: Pennsylvania, as general Hand is not here, has but one with the army: Maryland, which has two large brigades in the field, has only general Smallwood; and the North-Caro∣lina troops, since the departure of general M'Intosh, have been without any.—As I had taken the liberty upon a former occa∣sion to offer my sentiments to Congress and their committee
<PB N="252" REF="031423_0548_0FEC6037DE5D6830"/>
upon this subject, I should not trouble them now, if I was not more and more convinced that the service required promotions in this line. The frequent changes which take place among the officers, where there are no brigadiers, are attended with great inconvenience and detriment; and they are an effectual bar to the introduction of discipline. In such cases, the officers know that their command is but temporary, always liable to cease; and therefore they do not find themselves sufficiently interested to promote order and subordination; nor will the rest look up to them with that respect and deference which are essential. Every day's experience proves this, and shews be∣yond question that the affairs of a brigade can never be in a right train without a brigadier or some general officer to direct them.—It is certain these appointments, at the first view, will add a little to the list of expense: but in the end they will be a great saving, and produce many important advantages.—We are also a good deal distressed at this time for major-generals. However, as this arises more from the peculiar circumstances and situation of many which prevent them from duty in the line, than from a deficiency in the number appointed, I shall not add upon the occasion.</P>
<P>There is another branch of the army, which, in my opinion, calls loudly for the appointment of a general officer, and this is the cavalry.—For want of a proper regulating head in this corps, the whole has been in confusion, and of but very little service; whereas, under a right management, it might be most useful. The principal officers in it do not harmonise; which circumstance, with their disputes about rank, would (were there no other objections) effectually prevent the corps from rendering the public the services they have a right to expect, and of which it should be capable. To promote any gentleman now in it to a general command, would not be acquiesced in by the rest,—nor do I know that any of them wish it;—and it would increase their misunderstanding, and, of course, disorder.</P>
<P>I mean to draw all the horse immediately together, when I trust they will be under the direction of a general officer ap∣pointed by Congress for the purpose. Who he shall be, will remain solely with them to determine. However, I will take the liberty to add that he should be intelligent, active, atten∣tive; and, as far as I can judge, general Cadwallader or gene∣ral Reed would fill the post with great-honor and advantage; though it would seem, from the seat the latter has taken in Congress, and from his late appointment to the council of Penn∣sylvania, as if he had declined every military view. The abi∣lities
<PB N="253" REF="031423_0549_0FEC5FDB30DEA690"/>
of these gentlemen, as well as their attachment, are ge∣nerally known; and I am led to believe that either would be as acceptable to the corps as any person that can be found. In∣deed I have learned as much from two of the colonels.</P>
<P>I have been waiting with the most impatient anxiety to hear of count D'Estaing's arrival at Rhode-Island; but as yet I have not been so happy. My last intelligence from thence is a let∣ter from general Sullivan, dated at ten o'clock in the forenoon of the twenty-seventh, when he had no advice of the fleet.—He was in high spirits; and, from the preparation in which matters were, he entertained the most flattering hopes of suc∣cess in the intended enterprise.—The brigades of Varnum and Glover, with Jackson's detachment, would arrive, I expect, on the second instant.</P>
<P>As the army was encamped, and there was no great prospect of a sudden removal, I judged it advisable to send general Greene to the eastward on wednesday last, being fully persuad∣ed his services, as well in the quarter-master line as in the field, would be of material importance in the expedition against the enemy in that quarter. He is intimately acquainted with the whole of that country, and besides he has an extensive interest and influence in it. And, in justice to general Greene, I take occasion to observe that the public is much indebted to him for his judicious manage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent and active exertions in his present department. When he entered upon it, he found it in a most confused, distracted, and destitute state. This, by his conduct and industry, has undergone a very happy change, and such as enabled us with great facility to make a sudden move with the whole army and baggage from Valley-Forge in pursuit of the enemy, and to perform a march to this place. In a word, he has given the most general satisfaction, and his affairs carry much the face of method and system.—I also consider it as an act of justice to speak of the conduct of colonel Wadsworth, commissary-general. He has been indefatigable in his exer∣tions, to provide for the army; and, since his appointment, our supplies of provision have been good and ample.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 4.—At seven o'clock in the evening yesterday, I re∣ceived the inclosed letter from general Sullivan, with one ad∣dressed to myself, a copy of which I do myself the pleasure of forwarding.—I am exceedingly happy in the count's arrival, and that things wear so pleasing an aspect.</P>
<P>There is another subject on which I must take the liberty of addressing Congress, which is that of the clothier's department. I am perfectly satisfied, that, unless this very important and
<PB N="254" REF="031423_0550_0FEC606986CE9978"/>
interesting office is put under better regulations, the army will never be clothed. * * * I believe both officers and men, particularly the latter, have suffered greater inconveniences and distresses than soldiers ever did before, for want of clothing; and that this has not flowed more from a real scarcity of arti∣cles, than a want of proper exertions and provident manage∣ment to procure them.—It is essential that something should be done, and immediately, to place the department on a better footing. We have now a great many men entirely destitute of shirts and breeches, and I suppose not less than a fourth or fifth of the whole here who are without shoes. From the deficien∣cies in this line, numbers of desertions have proceeded,—not to mention deaths; and, what is still worse, the troops which re∣main, and see themselves in rags, want that spirit and pride ne∣cessary to constitute the soldier.</P>
<P>I have been informed by several officers, and by such as I can depend on, that many of the late draughts are willing and desirous of enlisting during the war. I do not conceive myself at liberty to give direction on the point, and therefore submit it to Congress to decide. However, if they can be engaged for the usual bounties allowed by the continent, after proper pre∣cautions are taken to prevent fraud, I think the measure will be expedient.—It is true, our affairs have an agreeable aspect at present: but the war may continue, and we—want men. A third of the time of some of them, and a half in the case of others, is already expired; and, as they will rise in their views, and become more difficult in proportion as their service draws to a conclusion,—if the step is considered advisable, the sooner we attempt to enlist, the better in all probability will the work succeed.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Fuhrer and Mr. Kleinsmit
 have lately left the Bri∣tish lines, and come in to us.—The account they give of them∣selves is this, that they had been first lieutenants in the Hessian corps, were taken prisoners at Trenton, resided during their captivity at Dumfries in Virginia, were lately exchanged, and have since resigned their commissions:—that having solicited per∣mission to come out from the enemy, and refused, they deter∣mined to leave them at all hazards, and have now put their de∣sign in execution.—The circumstances of their captivity are known to several officers in our army.</P>
<P>They are desirous of entering into our service, observing that there are a number of German officers in the same disposition with themselves, who will resign and join us, if they find that these meet with proper countenance.—It appears to me that important advantages may attend the encouraging a disposition of this nature (if it really exists,—which is far from being im∣possible) from the influence it will necessarily have upon the soldiery by increasing that spirit of desertion and discontent which already prevails among them.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="031423_0553_0FEC5FDD1BADF3E8"/>
Congress will best judge of the propriety of employing these gentlemen.—I have been thinking in what manner it might be done; and the mode least exceptionable, which at present oc∣curs to me, is to authorise them to raise a corps for themselves, by enlisting such German inhabitants, and such deserters from the foreign troops, as may be willing to engage. The corps at first, as it is only by way of experiment, need not be large, but may be afterwards increased as circumstances shall point out. This measure, I apprehend, cannot be attended with any material in∣convenience, and may be productive of utility. If the gentle∣men are employed at all, it must be in a new corps, as they could not be introduced into any of those already formed, with∣out injuring the officers in them, and producing dissatisfaction, murmurs, and resignations.</P>
<P>I have founded them on the plan here suggested, and they seem to be very sanguine in its success, and anxious to undertake it.—They expect some augmentation in rank; and indeed it seems necessary, in order the more effectually to interest others to follow their example: but caution should be used not to car∣ry the idea too far; because, besides other weighty considera∣tions, the higher the rank conferred on them, the more difficult it will be to provide for those who may hereafter come to us, and who will of course frame their expectations by comparison.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honor of transmitting to Congress the in∣closed memorial of colonel Rawlings, presented in behalf of himself and the Maryland officers who were under his command in the year 1776. The facts which are stated in it are gene∣rally true; and I cannot but feel myself exceedingly interested in favor of these gentlemen. The conduct of this whole corps, when Fort-Washington was attacked, is so generally known and approved, that it is almost unnecessary to add upon the subject. However I think it but justice to observe that every represent∣ation of that day's transaction gave them the highest credit.—They fought with a degree of veteran bravery; and, though but a handful, they maintained their ground a considerable time, notwithstanding the most vigorous efforts to force them. All who were spectators upon the occasion have declared this; and the enemy themselves have not refused them applause.</P>
<P>It seems hard that officers of their merit should be overlook∣ed,—and a loss to the service that they should remain unem∣ployed: but the consequences that would attend their incorpo∣ration with any of the corps now existing appear too disagree∣able, to try the experiment. Colonel Rawlings himself, from the information I have had, does not incline to give any uneasi∣ness to the line of the army, and would rather make a distant part of it against the Indians, in case he could be provided for in that way. Captain Beall, who is charged with this, will be able to inform Congress more fully than I can of the wishes of
<PB N="260" REF="031423_0556_0FEC606DA358D018"/>
the colonel and the rest of his officers; and his account may lead perhaps to some suitable and practicable provision for them. As I have observed before, they are men who deserve well of their country.—I only mention the Maryland officers upon this occasion, because that part of the corps which came from Virgi∣nia was provided for by the state in their present arrangement, as I have been credibly advised.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawlings was never in the complete and actual command of the regiment under his direction as colonel, because he never obtained a commission: but he became entitled to it according to the then common rule of promotion by the death of colonel Stephenson, and the non-acceptance of colonel Morgan who was appointed to it. Of the latter circumstance Mr. Rawlings, I am persuaded, was never apprised, as it was kept a secret from an apprehension that the enemy might claim an officer of the rank of colonel in exchange for Morgan who was then a prison∣er on parole, if his promotion came to their knowledge.—Ma∣jor Williams of the Maryland part of the corps was appointed by the state to one of her regiments now in the field, and is the only officer in his predicament I know of, that they arranged.</P>

By these, Congress will perceive our prospects are much changed with respect to the operations against Rhode-Island; and that the issue, as things are now circumstanced,—whether we look to a continuation of the siege, to an immedi∣ate attack, or a retreat,—must be attended with great difficul∣ty and risk.—I trust the wisest measures will be pursued; and I will hope for the best.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WOULD take the liberty to inform Congress that colo∣nel Armand is come to camp with his corps, and has applied to me for commissions for his officers.—By the resolution for esta∣blishing the corps, it was to be officered out of the foreigners then commissioned in our service, who were not nor could be provided for in any of the regiments. Instead of this, there are only three officers in the corps who before held any com∣missions in our service, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> lieutenant-colonel Vrigney, and captains Mercley and Shafner. The two last were only lieu∣tenants, and are now appointed to captaincies, contrary (it seems to me) to the spirit and intention of the resolution.</P>
<P>As colonel Armand has departed from his instructions which must govern me, I am not authorised to grant the commissions he requires, and am therefore under the necessity of troubling Congress with the arrangement of the corps, No. 1, as it now actually stands for their consideration and decision.—The colo∣nel founds his deviation from the resolve upon some verbal in∣timation
<PB N="262" REF="031423_0558_0FEC606FD4A18E20"/>
given him that the part in question would not be in∣sisted on.</P>
<P>I would also take the liberty to mention that general Du Portail lately delivered me a memorial, in which, among other things, he represents that he had made an agreement with Con∣gress at his first appointment, that neither himself nor the other gentlemen with him should be commanded by any of the engi∣neers who had preceded them in our army.—I could not but answer that the commissions of officers were the only rule of precedency and command I had to judge by; and, while others held superior appointments, I must consider them accordingly in the course of service. He gave me the inclosed letter to you upon the subject, and is extremely anxious to have the matter placed upon a certain footing: and, no doubt, it will be for the good and tranquility of the service that the claim be determined as speedily as possible one way or the other. At the same time I think it right to observe that it cannot be expected that colonel Cosciusko, who has been a good while in this line, and conducted himself with reputation and satis∣faction, will consent to act in a subordinate capacity to any of the French gentlemen except general Du Portail. * * *</P>
<P>Since I had the honor of writing you on the twenty-fifth in∣stant, I have not received a single line from general Sullivan. The only intelligence I have from the eastward is from mon∣sieur Pontjobean. This gentlemen left Rhode-Island the twen∣ty-seventh, and arrived about two hours ago in camp. From him I learn that our people were still on the island;—that it was generally thought they had made effectual provision for a retreat in case of exigency;—that in the evening of that day he met monsieur Preville, an officer belonging to the Langue∣doc, at Providence, going with dispatches to general Sullivan,—who informed him that the French fleet had got into Boston.—He further adds that monsieur Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oune who was in company with him at Providence, and who had more conversation with monsieur Preville than he himself had, told him that monsieur Preville said count D'Estaing had sailed or was on the point of sailing again for Rhode-Island with ten ships of the line and his frigates.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favor of the twenty-eighth and that of the thirtieth ultimo, with the several inclosures to which they refer.</P>
<P>Congress may rely that I will use every possible means in my power to conciliate any differences that may have arisen in consequence of the count D'Estaing's going to Boston, and to prevent a publication of the protest upon the occasion.—Seve∣ral days before the receipt of the resolution, I had written to the eastward, urging the necessity of harmony, and the expedi∣ency of affording the admiral every assistance to refit his ships. This I repeated after the resolution came to hand; and I have also taken opportunity to request all the general officers here to place the matter in the most favorable point of view whene∣ver they hear it mentioned.</P>
<P>The five hundred guineas, which Congress were pleased to order, came safe to hand, and shall be appropriated to the pur∣poses they intended, and as the exigency of the service may re∣quire.—For want of supplies of this sort, we have been very deficient in intelligence in many important and interesting points. In some cases, no consideration in paper money has been found sufficient to effect even an engagement to pro∣cure it: and, where it has been otherwise, the terms of ser∣vice, on account of the depreciation, have been high, if not ex∣orbitant.</P>
<P>The design of the enemy, as to their future movements, re∣main yet entirely [<HI>in the dark</HI>]: but the expectation of their leaving the continent is daily decreasing. The hurricane sea∣son seems opposed to their going to the West-Indies; and the passage to Europe in a little time will become more and more dangerous. Besides these, there is another circumstance, of
<PB N="264" REF="031423_0560_0FEC6047F6693AD0"/>
some weight, if true, to induce a belief that they mean to stay. It appears by the papers that part of the regiments lately rais∣ed in Britain are ordered to Halifax. If the troops here were intended to be recalled, it would seem that some of them would be sent to reinforce that gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ison sooner than troops from Eng∣land or Scotland; and hence I think it may be presumed that another campaign will take place in America, especially if ad∣ministration are disappointed in their expectations from the commission.</P>
<P>Where the theatre of war may be, must be a matter of con∣jecture. But, as it is an acknowledged fact that an army act∣ing in the eastern states must derive flour for its support from those more western, I submit to Congress the expediency, and, in my opinion, the necessity, of establishing, without loss of time, magazines of this article at convenient places (removed from the Sound) in Connecticut and Massachusetts. I am the more induced to wish an early consideration of this point, as, by a sudden move of the army, (should events make it necessa∣ry) the departments of commissary and quarter-master would be greatly distressed. Nor would such magazines, I should imagine, be attended with any considerable loss, though the ar∣my should not operate in that quarter, as the flour would an∣swer occasionally for our shipping, and the surplus might in all probability be otherwise readily disposed of.</P>
<P>I take the liberty of transmitting to Congress a memorial I received from the reverend Mr. Tetard.—From the certificates annexed to it, he appears to be a man of great merit; and from every account, he has suffered in the extreme in the present contest. His attachment, services, and misfortunes, seem to give him a claim to a generous notice: but, according to the new establishment of the army, it is not in my power to make any provision for him. I therefore recommend his case to the attention and consideration of Congress.</P>
<P><HI>Six o'clock, P. M.</HI>—I this minute received a letter from general Sullivan, of which the inclosure, No. 2, is a copy. I shall be exceedingly happy if a perfect reconciliation has taken place between him and the count and all the officers.—His letter will shew some of the reasons that led to the protest, and that it was the hope of our officers that it would have operated as a justification to the admiral, to return against the sentiments of his council, especially as it coincided (as it is said) with his own inclination.—I had these reasons from another hand when the protest first came.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="031423_0561_0FEC5FE6CA36E228"/>
<HI>September</HI> 5.—I was duly honored yesterday evening with your favor of the thirty-first ultimo.—Though it is not express∣ed in the resolution of that date that any other bounty is to be given to the men who engage for three years or during the war, than twenty dollars, I shall take it for granted they are to re∣ceive the usual allowances of clothing and land.—There are se∣veral continental troops whose time of service will expire at the end of the fall or during the winter. I shall consider these within the meaning and operation of the resolve, though they are not mentioned; and shall direct every necessary measure to be taken to re-enlist them.</P>
<P>From the exorbitant state, town, and substitute bounties, I am very doubtful whether twenty dollars will be found suffici∣ent to engage so great a proportion either of the draughts or continentals, as was at first apprehended. Our failure in the enterprise against Rhode-Island will have its weight; and every day, from the approach of the fall and winter, will add new difficulties. As it is a work of the most essential importance, I will order it to be begun the the instant the money arrives: and, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, on experiment, the sum should prove too small, I would submit it to Congress whether it will not be expedient to pass another resolve, abthorising a further bounty of ten dol∣lars, to be used as circumstances may make it necessary. This can remain a secret, and will not be carried into execution but in case of evident necessity.—I feel very much interested upon the occasion, and have submitted this mode, that there may not be the least possible delay in attempting to engage the men under a second expedient if the first should not succeed.—The articles of clothing and blankets should also employ the utmost attention to provide them: we are now in great want, particu∣larly of the latter; there not being less than actually wanted at this moment.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honor of returning to Congress the re∣port of their committee on the subject of an inspectorship (transmitted in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, which was not received till the thirty-first), with such observations as have occurred to me in considering the matter, and which I have made with a freedom that I trust will be agreeable to Congress. I wish it had been in my power to have returned it before: but the intervention of a variety of other important business from
<PB N="267" REF="031423_0563_0FEC5FEB06D1AE88"/>
time to time obliged me to postpone a conclusion upon the points till yesterday.</P>
<P>I have already, in my letter of the twenty-sixth of July, de∣livered my sentiments upon the consequences that would attend the baron Steuben's being appointed to an actual and perma∣nent command in the line; and therefore I will not trouble Congress with a repetition of them. However, I will take the liberty to add that I am more and more convinced that what I then said upon the occasion was well founded; and that I am certain such a measure will produce at least infinite discontents and disquietudes among the general officers.</P>
<P>I have also had the honor to receive your favor of the fifth instant, with the several papers to which it refers. These shall have my attention as far as practicable.—I hope all the conse∣derate troops are on the march from Philadelphia; and, if they are not, that immediate orders will be given for their joining the army.</P>
<P>The inclosed copy of a letter from general Sullivan, of the tenth instant, will inform Congress that the enemy have not re∣linquished their burning plans, and that in this way they have destroyed several houses, stores, and vessels, at and near Bed∣ford.</P>
<P>I was advised on wednesday night that a body of them, con∣sisting of four or five thousand, under general Grey, had made a landing in that quarter, and were intrenching. In consequence of this, and from an apprehension that general Clinton might possibly mean to operate to the eastward, and form some project in concert with lord Howe against the count D'Estaing's squa∣dron, I determined to move the troops from this ground to a rear position, better calculated to afford support to the works on the North-river, in case an attempt should be made against them, and at the same time more convenient for forwarding de∣tachments to the eastward, if the enemy point their operations that way.</P>
<P>I was the more induced to come to this determination as most of the accounts from New-York seemed to lead to a belief, as they still do, that a considerable movement was and is in con∣templation, if not an entire evacuation of the city, and this by water. Besides these reasons, the principal objects for taking post here do not now exist. One was to create every possible jealousy in favor of the expedition against Rhode-Island; ano∣ther the consuming the forage within its vicinity and towards Kingsbridge. The former is now over, and the latter in a great degree accomplished.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the twelfth instant, I have received your several favors of the tenth, twelfth and sixteenth, with the resolutions to which they allude.—I transmitted the British commissioners the resolve of the fourth instant respecting the convention troops the morning after it came to hand, and also wrote to sir Henry Clinton upon the subject of passports.—I have not received his answer.</P>
<P>With respect to the magazines, I have directed the commis∣sary to form them on the inland communication from hence to Boston, at proper intervals. The twenty thousand barrels of flour that Congress have ordered to be purchased will be a va∣luable addition, if they can be transported by water; but it seems to me there will be great risk of its being lost, if it is sent by sea while the enemy have a superior fleet on our coast.</P>
<P>As the campaign is not closed yet, all our cavalry are of use.—They lie in the neighborhood of the enemy's posts, for the purpose of restraining their parties, and for obtaining and giving intelligence of the enemy's movements; and they are subsisted upon the forage which would otherwise be exposed to them.—I am sensible that these corps are attended with great expense; and the moment I think the service will admit of it, they or a part of them shall be quartered in different places distant from the army, where they may be provided for on better terms.—The price of forage; and the difficulty of getting it, are really objects of great magnitude, and such as should undergo some regulation, if there is any that can be adopted.—I received let∣ters a few days ago from the commissary and quarter master upon this subject, copies of which, and of my letter in conse∣quence to the several states from Massachusetts-Bay to Penn∣sylvania inclusive, I take the liberty to inclose.</P>
<P>The resolution prohibiting officers, except such as are speci∣ally authorised, to keep horses in the army or within forty miles of it, has been published in orders, and I will take every step in my power to give it effect.</P>
<P>I have considered the practicability of reducing the teams em∣ployed in the army, and find, however desirable the object may be, that it cannot be done. We have not at this time more than are absolutely and indispensably necessary, nor so many as would be necessary in case of a rapid movement: neither does it ap∣pear to me that there can be a substitution of ox for horse teams,
<PB N="269" REF="031423_0565_0FEC47C28B001DC8"/>
at least to any great extent; nor that any material advantages would arise from such a measure. There might perhaps be a small saving in the article of provender: but this, I fear, would be greatly over-balanced by the loss of cattle that would be ap∣propriated to the use of the commissary's department. After a full investigation of the subject, I believe we shall be obliged to adhere to the kind of teams we now employ, and that the only relief we shall have in point of expense will arise from sending a part of the horses to places where they can more easily be foraged, when we have fixed our camp and quarters for the winter.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congress that there is a necessity of some mode's being established, by which claims on the old quarter-mastership, that remain unsatisfied, may be discharged. There are many of this nature; and these, however well au∣thenticated they may be, the gentlemen now in office do not conceive themselves at liberty to adjust, without obtaining some special direction for the purpose. I am every day applied to for payment of such accounts, and, in many instances, have been obliged, as well for the sake of justice to individuals as for the public good, to order them to be taken up. It appears to me that Congress cannot be too early in their resolution upon this occasion, and that either the present department should be au∣thorised to settle and pay such claims, or that some persons should be appointed and supplied with money for the purpose.</P>
<P>The army marched from White-Plains on the sixteenth in∣stant, and is now encamped in different places.—Three brigades, composing the Virginia troops, part of the right wing, under the command of general Putnam, are at Robinson's near West-Point: and two brigades more, composing the remainder, are with baron De Kalb at Fishkill plains, about ten miles from the town, on the road lead leading to Sharon. The second line, with lord Stirling, is in the vicinity of Fredericsburg; and the whole of the left wing at Danbury under the command of gene∣ral Gates.—These several posts appear to be the best we can occupy in the present doubtful state of things, as they have re∣lation to the support of West-Point, in case of an attack in that quarter, and are also on the communication to the eastward, if the enemy point their operations that way.—Besides these dis∣positions, general Scott with a light corps remains below in the country about King's-Street.</P>
<P>The letter from sir Henry Clinton which I have the honor of transmitting was sent to me to-day by colonel Baylor who is post∣ed at Hackinsac. He says he received one for me by the same flag; and, from his note, he supposed he had charged the horse∣man
<PB N="270" REF="031423_0566_0FEC47BA2AD91DC0"/>
with it who just arrived at head-quarters. Through acci∣dent he forwarded yours to me; and I think it probable that you will be troubled with mine. If this should be the case, you will be so obliging as to return it to me by the first con∣veyance.—I was also informed by colonel Baylor that a consi∣derable body of the enemy landed at Paulus' Hook in the even∣ing of the twenty-second, and were encamped that night in the woods between four and five miles from the town of Bergen. He had not learned their object: but it is likely they are after forage.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following is an extract of a letter of the seventeenth instant, which I had the honor to receive from the count D'∣Estaing.</P>
<P>"I entreat you to promote the exchange of prisoners alrea∣day planned by monsieur Girard. The unhappy persons taken before the commencement of hostilities cannot be fully regard∣ed as prisoners: their lot is dreadful. The mode adopted for exchanging them by means of your commissary, without intro∣ducing the king's name or mine into the transaction, removes a great part of the political difficulties which before subsisted."</P>
<P>I am an entire stranger to the plan above referred to, or to the mode that has been adopted for exchanging by means of our commissary. He is absent from the army: and I must therefore beg the favor of you to obtain from monsieur Girard such information as will enable me to give directions for carry∣ing the count's desires into execution, if practicable.</P>
<P>The marquis De Vienne, at present at Boston, has requested a furlough of eighteen months to enable him to return to France, whither he is called by some domestic concerns. I do not conceive myself at liberty to grant his request without the permission of Congress, to whom I would beg leave to observe, that, if agreeable to them, he may be indulged without pre∣judice to the service, as he is not attached to any particular command.</P>
<P>I have just received an account from Jersey, which I fear is too true, that colonel Baylor's regiment of dragoons were sur∣prised in their quarters the night before last, and most of them killed or taken.—A few of the stragglers have come in, who can give but a very imperfect account of the matter. They
<PB N="271" REF="031423_0567_0FEC5F1544C7A200"/>
think the colonel and most of the officers were made prisoners, and that the privates were put to the sword.—There were, I imagine, about one hundred men of the regiment together when this unlucky accident happened.</P>
<P>The stay of the enemy in Jersey being longer than I appre∣hended, and not knowing what their real intentions may be, I have ordered general Maxwell to advance from Elizabethtown to the neighborhood of Aquakenunk bridge, and have sent over general Woodford's brigade from this side of the river. I have also ordered general Pulaski to advance with as much expedition as possible, and join the brigades.—Lord Stirling has this day gone over to take the command of the continental forces and militia who are assembling in considerable numbers. If the enemy mean only to forage, they will be kept from ex∣tending themselves, by these troops: and if they have any de∣signs upon the posts in the Highlands, they will be prevented from seizing the passes leading to the forts, by lord Stirling, who will be between them and the enemy, and always ready to possess them.</P>
<P>I have made proper dispositions on this side the river for the security of the Highlands in case that body of the enemy, who are on this side Kingsbridge employed in collecting forage, should advance.</P>
<P>The sketch of Rhode-Island, forwarded by this express, was received from general Sullivan, and left behind by accident when the last dispatches were sent off.</P>
<P>I have had the honor of receiving yours of the twentieth, inclosing an order for count Pulaski's legion to advance to Trenton.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with your favor of the twenty-seventh of September, with the inclosed resoves of Congress, a copy of which has been transmitted to major-general Lincoln for his information and direction.</P>
<P>Being separated from my papers, I am uncertain whether I mentioned in my last, that, the enemy in the Jerseys having received a reinforcement and made some forward movements, I had thought it expedient to detach another brigade thither to act in conjunction with the one already there together with Pulaski's corps and the militia, and had sent major-general
<PB N="272" REF="031423_0568_0FEC5F0A5419C850"/>
lord Stirling to take the command of the whole;—that I had also ordered major-general Putnam across the river for the im∣mediate security of West-Point, and moved a division of troops to this place, to be nearer that post.—I have since come here myself, and propose to remain till the views of the enemy on the Jerseys are decided; though I have had no reason to alter my opinion that nothing more than a forage is intended.—By the last accounts, they had drawn in their out-parties, and re∣sumed their first bounds behind Hackinsac river, at the liberty∣pole and Newbridge.</P>
<P>That part of Baylor's regiment which escaped came off in the first instance, and were afterwards brought off in so dipers∣ed a manner that the number has not been ascertained: but, from what I have learned, I should estimate the loss at about fifty men and seventy horses.—Major Clough is dead of his wounds.—This affair seems to have been attended with every circumstance of cruelty.</P>
<P>It is a small compensation for this accident, that colonel But∣ler three or four days ago, with a party of infantry and horse comprehending major Lee's corps, surprised about a hundred Yagers below Tarrytown, killed ten on the spot, and took a lieutenant and eighteen men prisoners.—The roughness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountry facilitated the flight of the rest, and prevented the suc∣cess being more complete.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be delivered to you by major-general the mar∣quis De la Fayette.—The generous motives, which first induc∣ed him to cross the Atlantic and enter the army of the United States, are well known to Congress.—Reasons equally laudable now engage his return to France, which in her present circum∣stances claims his services.—His eagerness to offer his duty to his prince and country, however great, could not influence him to quit the continent in any stage of an unfinished campaign. He resolved to remain at least till the close of the present, and embraces this moment of suspense to communicate his wishes to Congress with a view of having the necessary arrangements
<PB N="273" REF="031423_0569_0FEC5F0621989218"/>
made in time, and of being still within reach, should any occa∣sion offer of distinguishing himself in the field.</P>
<P>The marquis at the same time, from a desire of preserving a relation with us, and a hope of having it yet in his power to be useful as an American officer, solicits only a furlough sufficient for the purposes above-mentioned.—A reluctance to part with an officer, who unites to all the military fire of youth an uncom∣mon maturity of judgment, would lead me to prefer his being absent on this footing, if it depended on me. I shall always be happy to give such a testimony of his services as his bravery and conduct on all occasions entitle him to; and I have no doubt that Congress will add suitable expressions of their sense of his merit, and their regret on account of his departure.</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE incessant and pressing applications of the officers, and their real distress for clothing, oblige me to repeat my wish∣es to the board, to obtain the earliest direction of Congress for relieving their wants.—They are in a very disagreeable situa∣tion in this respect; and, unless some mode can be adopted for speedily supplying them, many will be obliged involuntarily to quit the service; or, if this should not be the case, we shall be involved in perpetual complaints, and the most painful applica∣tions.</P>
<P>I do not recollect, when the army was first appointed, that there was any engagement on the part of the public that the officers should be provided with clothing through their means; nor has there been any explicit declaration since, that I remember, for the purpose: but the measure has become indispensably neces∣sary; and, without the intervention of public aid, they never can be supplied: for their pay, if the articles proper could be found in a private way, (from the enormous and exorbitant prices now exacted for every thing) would prove wholly incompetent to the end.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="031423_0570_0FEC607CCA03CFF0"/>
There is however a resolution of Congress, of the twenty-se∣cond of November last, which points to a provision through the public means and those of the states individually taken. This has encouraged the officers to look for supplies in the manner there professed; and their not being able to obtain them makes them more uneasy perhaps than if the resolution had never pas∣sed.</P>
<P>I have written to messieurs Otis and Andrews to make a re∣turn of the cloth, &amp;c. in their hands, proper for officers, and also to advise me what quantities might be procured in case the board should direct a purchase. This appears to be the only practicable expedient at this time, from which relief can be drawn: and, if it is to be adopted, the agents cannot be too soon ordered to carry it into execution.—I really wish to be inform∣ed by the board by the first opportunity whether the officers may expect supplies through the public stores, that I may be able to answer them decisively upon the point when they apply. As matters now stand, I am in a very awkward and irksome si∣tuation.</P>
<P>Since it is evident that the officers cannot provide themselves with clothing, and that there is a necessity for the intervention of the public aid, I would submit it to the board whether it may not be proper for them to form an estimate of clothing, propor∣tioned to the number of officers in the army, for the considera∣tion of Congress, and to obtain their sanction for importing the same, if they approve the plan. This measure, it seems to me is the only one that can ensure relief in future; and it appears the more eligible as the loss to the public will be infinitely less than if they procure the articles in the country, supposing that it could be done. Besides this consideration, the officers then might be properly uniformed and all placed on a just and equal footing.</P>
<P>If the board should be authorised to direct an immediate purchase of clothing for the officers, I will take the liberty to suggest that it may not be improper for them to enjoin on the part of the clothier a stricter compliance with the resolution of Congress, which I have mentioned, in the sale. The officers say that hitherto it has not had the necessary and generous operation intended by Congress; but, on the contrary, in the few instan∣ces in which they have been able to furnish themselves with ar∣ticles from the public stores, that they have done it at the cur∣rent exorbitant prices.—Indeed there are many matters in the department which require a more perfect and explicit arrange∣ment than has ever been made▪ and at present there is such a
<PB N="275" REF="031423_0571_0FEC5F3CED12C9B0"/>
clashing of offices and officers that it is difficult to determine how or with whom business is to be transacted.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addressing you on the sixth instant by favor of the marquis De la Fayette, I received your letter of the second with its inclosure.</P>
<P>I do myself the honor of transmitting you an account of the engagement between the French and British fleets on the twen∣ty-seventh of July, as published by the British admiralty-board.—I received a printed copy of it last night from New-York, which I have forwarded to his excellency count D'Estaing.—It is evident from admiral Keppel's own relation of the affair, that he was pretty severely handled, notwithstanding he affects in the conclusion to mention that he wished extremely for an opportunity to renew the combat the next day.</P>
<P>We are still in great suspense as to the operations and designs of the enemy, though every practicable measure has been used and is pursuing to come at them. By late and direct accounts it would seem that some troops at least are going from New-York. A few days, I think, must open their conduct deci∣sively.</P>
<P>I have had the misfortune to hear that the Raleigh frigate has become a prize to two British ships of war after a long and very gallant resistance. Captain Barry, finding that the frigate would fall into the enemy's hands, ran her ashore on Seal-Island, to which he escaped in boats with about eighty of his hands, and from thence to the main. It is said he took measures for blow∣ing her up, but was defeated in his purpose by the perfidy of an under officer who concealed himself and remained on board.</P>

<P>I AM honored with yours of the ninth, inclosing the re∣solves to extend the embargo, and to prevent forestalling provi∣sions. I hope the latter will have the desired effect; for, un∣less
<PB N="276" REF="031423_0572_0FEC5F8DE6A7B8B0"/>
that most infamous practice of raising the prices of the ne∣cessaries of life can be stopped, it will be impossible for any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands to subsist the army.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have the copy of a petition from the refugees in New-York to the commissioners. You may depend upon the authenticity of it, as it is taken from a New-York paper. It should seem by this that they are extremely solicitous and anxious to know whether New-York is to be garrisoned, which implies a suspicion on their part that it to be evacuated.—All accounts, since mine of the fourteenth, confirm the report of a very considerable embarkation. It is said to consist of ten British regiments completed to their full establishment, and their grenadier and light companies added to them. This will make them amount to upwards of five thousand men.—They have not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed.</P>
<P>I cannot say that I am satisfied that a total evacuation of the city is intended this winter, although many inhabitants near the lines, and several out of the city, are of that opinion.—I have set every engine at work to procure full intelligence of their designs; and I hope to succeed. The current opinion of deserters and others is that the present embarkation is intended for the West-Indies; some few have said that they have a de∣sign upon Charleston.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE letter which I had the honor of addressing to you the day before yesterday would inform Congress of the embark∣ation and sailing of a considerable detachment of the enemy from New-York, and of the measures I had taken in expecta∣tion of and upon the happening of the event.—Whether this will be succeeded by a further embarkation, or by a total eva∣cuation of the posts which they hold within the states, in the course of this year or the ensuing one, I cannot pretend to de∣termine. But, as it will be right and prudent in us to provide for every contingency, I would with the greatest deference sub∣mit it to Congress whether it may not be proper for them to call upon the states to provide men in time for filling their res∣pective battalions, before or at any rate against the opening of the spring, and in the same manner as if there was a moral cer∣tainty that the war would be prosecuted with all possible vigor on the part of Britain. Should this not be the case, or should
<PB N="277" REF="031423_0573_0FEC60761E9C26B0"/>
any events cast up in the mean time to render troops unneces∣sary, it will be easy to disband the levies and to keep them from the field,—while, on the other hand, our relaxation in not providing them may subject us at least to many disagreea∣ble consequences.</P>
<P>The general return of the infantry in the month of Septem∣ber, transmitted to the board of war by the adjutant-general, and to which I beg leave to refer, will shew Congress the whole amount of our reputed force at that time. But I am to observe, that large, very large deductions are to be made from it on ac∣count of the columns of sick, and the men said to be on com∣mand. Many under the former description, particularly that of sick absent, are actually dead; others unfit for service; and several, who have recovered, have deserted: nor will the latter afford more than one half of its number in time of action, as various duties, such as waggoning, distant guards, escorts, &amp;c. employ a great proportion of those under this denomination.</P>
<P>Besides the above deductions, Congress will perceive from the return which I now take the liberty of transmitting, that there are four thousand three hundred and eighty draughts and others, whose terms of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvice will expire during and by the close of winter: for I am sorry to add that our exertions to re∣engage the draughts and old soldiers in this predicament, for the usual bounty, have proved so far ineffectual and without success. I have not tried what effect the additional grant of ten dollars might have: but I fear, and it seems to be the opi∣nion of all I have consulted upon the occasion, that it would have but little if any influence. I know, in the case of the draughts and troops of one state, that the offer of twenty dol∣lars on the part of the continent, with a like allowance and an actual deposit of it by the state, has been no temptation.</P>
<P>The general reluctance and refusal is founded in the unhappy depreciated light in which the soldiery view the money, and their expectation of receiving immense state, district, and sub∣stitute bounties. Whether grants or bounties by Congress, bearing some proportion to these, to such as should enlist for the war, would be attended with better success, I cannot un∣dertake to decide. The experiment may be made if they judge it proper: and if it proves an inducement of any extent, it will be an infinite saving in the end. I believe however our surest and only certain aids will be derived from draughting, which I trust may and will be done by the states on the recom∣mendation of Congress, agreeable to the mode mentioned in my letter to their committee when they first honored me with
<PB N="278" REF="031423_0574_0FEC5FF6A5BE1C00"/>
a visit at Valley-Forge. The exertions to recruit by volunta∣ry enlistments may still go on, as both modes in all probability will not produce near as many men as may be found necessary.</P>
<P>In the case of the Carolina troops whose service is ending every day, the officers say that nothing will induce them to enlist, unless they can be permitted to go home on furlough till the spring. On this indulgence they seem to think several might be engaged.—The distance is great, and there will be some uncertainty as to their returning: besides, it will be fix∣ing a precedent for others.—If Congress approve the plan, they will be pleased to inform me by the earliest opportunity.</P>
<P>I am under some difficulty about clothing the draughts, and the old soldiers whose service is expiring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will determine every day. As Congress have never expressed their sense up∣on the subject, and this is increased by a letter which I receiv∣ed some time ago from the board of war, which respects parti∣cularly the draughts, I must earnestly request that Congress will favor me with the speediest direction in the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, whether they are to be furnished out of the supplies coming on, equally with the other troops. At the same time I will take the li∣berty to offer it as my opinion, that, however inconvenient or expensive it may appear at the first view to clothe them, the measure will be necessary, and founded not only in humanity but found policy. We have no prospect now of levying men in any other way: and if they are not clothed, they will be ex∣hausted by sickness and death; and not doing it may prove an insurmountable bar or at least a great obstacle to our obtaining future aids, though the exigencies of our affairs should be ne∣ver so pressing. Yet the clothes may be withheld as long as circumstances will permit, as an inducement for them to enlist. In the instance of the old soldiers who have not received the annual allowance of Congress, the point seems clearly in their favor.—The board suggested that the draughts might be sup∣plied out of the best of the old clothes which might be given in by the troops on receiving new ones:—but unfortunately there will be few of any worth.</P>

<P>The certain intelligence of a large number of troops having embarked at New-York,—the sailing of a considerable fleet concurring at the moment their departure was expected,—lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me no room to doubt that the fleet which went out of the Hook on the nineteenth and early the twentieth instant contained the embarkation of which I had been advised. In the persuasion of this, my letter of the twenty-second to your excellency was written: but, from more recent advices, and through various channels, bearing every mark of authenticity, I am to conclude the supposition has been ill founded.—The above mentioned fleet appears to have carried away no other troops than inva∣lids, the officers of the corps lately reduced, with some refu∣gees.—The twenty-third instant the troops which had embark∣ed still remained in the harbor. They are fixed at ten or twelve British regiments, and six of the new levies.—This fleet was probably composed of homeward-bound victuallers, with some merchantmen and other vessels which chose to take the protection of a convoy. The accounts still say that they were accompanied by fourteen or fifteen sail of the line and some frigates.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honored with yours of the nineteenth, twenty-seventh, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth, ultimo.</P>
<P>A tolerable supply of shoes has lately arrived to the issuing clothier's store from the eastward, Pennsylvania, and Jersey▪ and, if the different persons employed in procuring that article will exert themselves to keep up the supply, I hope we shall not be much distressed during the winter, provided we remain quietly in quarters.</P>
<P>It is much to be wished that Congress would come to a spee∣dy resolution concerning the procuring clothing for the officers at a price in proportion to their pay, more especially, as they were led to expect this from a resolve which passed in Novem∣ber 1777.—If the clothing itself cannot be conveniently pro∣cured, I imagine the alternative of allowing an adequate sum of money in lieu thereof would be the next best expedient.</P>
<P>As the board must undoubtedly have experienced the many difficulties arising from the want of a proper arrangement of the clothier's department, I hope they will press the committee who have that business in charge, to bring in their report, that the new system may be carried into execution without loss of time.—Whether it has been owing to want of conduct in the late officer, or his want of proper powers and directions, I will not undertake to determine: but the irregularity in that de∣partment has been an endless source of trouble to me, and a great cause of discontent in the army.</P>
<P>I have given the issuing clothier directions to keep an account of the marks and numbers of the bales of blankets, and of the quality of their contents, from whence you will be able to trace from whom those small ones were purchased. When the issues are completed, you shall have the account.—The directions to Mr. Mease were very proper.—If any corps want completing in any particular article which is not to be procured here, I will sign the order myself.</P>
<P>In the present scarcity of hats, the caps of which you have
<PB N="282" REF="031423_0578_0FEC5F9A5FCC4A10"/>
forwarded a pattern must be used by way of substitute. But an officer very attentive to the health of his men informs me that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> an inconvenience from the use of woollen caps last winter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stead of hats; when the men put them off in the spring, they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of them took violent colds from the sudden transi∣tion. They also contribute to keep the head dirty,—than which nothing is more unhealthy.</P>
<P>I find it impracticable to carry the recommendation of the board, respecting calling in the old clothes upon delivery of the new, into execution. The soldiers were not to be convinc∣ed of the good policy and economy intended by the application of the old clothes to hospitals and the followers of the army, but looked upon it as an unjustifiable attempt to deprive them of what they had earned by their year's service, and what (con∣sidering the scanty supply of some kinds of covering, blankets in particular) would help to make them more comfortable du∣ring the winter. These discontents were communicated to me, the moment they arose, by some of the best officers in the line; which determined me to let the matter drop, more especially as another argument was made use of, which was unanswerable: this was, that, upon a fair settlement, there would be found a considerable deficiency of the bounty-clothing for a year or two past, and that therefore it would be more equitable to make up the deficiency than to draw in the remains.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON wednesday afternoon I received a letter from the honorable Mr. Lee and Mr. Lovell of the committee for fo∣reign affairs, inclosing a plan and sundry resolutions of Congress for attacking Canada the next campaign in conjunction with the forces of his most christian majesty,—and requesting my observations upon the same to be transmitted to Congress, and a copy to be delivered to the marquis De la Fayette. These dispatches, through the indisposition of the marquis (who un∣fortunately was seized with a fever in his journey from Phila∣delphia, which still detains him at Fishkill), were prevented coming to hand till that time: and the great importance and extent of the subject they comprehend would not permit me the honor of an earlier communication of my sentiments.—I hope Congress will excuse my not complying with that part of the resolution which requires me to deliver a copy of my ob∣servations.
<PB N="283" REF="031423_0579_0FEC5FFD9C25EEC0"/>
to the marquis, as the manner in which I am obliged to treat the subject opens such a prospect of our wants and our weaknesses, as, in point of policy, ought only to be knows to ourselves.</P>
<P>I am-always happy to concur in sentiment with Congress; and I view the emancipation of Canada as an object very inte∣resting to the future prosperity and tranquility of these states: but I am sorry to say the plan proposed for the purpose does not appear to me to be eligible under our present circumstan∣ces.—I consider it as my duty, and what Congress expects from me, to give my reasons for this opinion with that frank∣ness and candor which the importance of the subject demands; and, in doing this, I am persuaded I shall not fail to meet with their approbation.</P>
<P>It seems to me impolitic to enter into engagements with the court of France for carrying on a combined operation of any kind without a moral certainty of being able to fulfil our parts, particularly if the first proposal came from us. If we should not be able to perform them, it would argue either a want of consideration, a defective knowledge of our resources, or some∣thing worse than either, which could not fail to produce a de∣gree of distrust and discontent that might be very injurious to the Union. In the present instance, should the scheme proposed be adopted, a failure on our part would certainly occasion in them a misapplication of a considerable land and naval force which might be usefully employed elsewhere, and probably their total loss.—It is true, if we were at this time to enter into the engagement, we should be every day better able to judge whe∣ther it will be in our power to accomplish what may be expect∣ed from us: and, if we should find hereafter that our resources will be unequal to the undertaking, we may give notice to the court of France in season to prevent the sailing of the troops and the ill effects that might attend it. But besides that a pro∣ject of this kind could not be embraced by France without its having, an influence on the whole system of operations for the next campaign, which of course would receive some derangement from its being abandoned,—a renunciation of this could not fail to give a very unfavorable impression of our foresight and pro∣vidence, and would serve to weaken the confidence of that court in our public councils.</P>
<P>So far from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e being a moral certainty of our complying with our engagements, it may in my opinion be very safely pro∣nounced, that, if the enemy keep possession of their present posts at New-York and Rhode-Island, it will be impracticable either
<PB N="284" REF="031423_0580_0FEC607E665723C8"/>
to furnish the men or the other necessary supplies for prosecut∣ing the plan. They will not attempt to keep those posts with less than ten thousand men and a considerable navy.—If it should be thought best for the advantage of carrying on the expeditions intended, to forego any offensive operations against these garri∣sons, and to leave them in quiet possession of such important places, we shall at least be obliged to provide for the security of the country against their incursions and depredations, by keep∣ing up a force sufficient to confine them within their own limits. It is natural too to suppose that the people's expectations of be∣ing protected will grow stronger in proportion to the diminution of the enemy's force, and the greater facility with which it can be afforded. They will hardly be content to continue in a state of alarm and insecurity from a force so inconsiderable, while the principal strength of the states is drawn out in the prosecution of remote objects.—If this reasoning is just, we shall be obliged to have a larger force than the enemy, posted in different places to prevent sudden inroads which they would otherwise be able to make at different points: and the number required cannot be estimated at less than twelve or fifteen thousand men. This will be two thirds as large a force as we have been able to raise and maintain during the progress of the war, as these calcula∣tions both of the enemy's strength and of our own are meant to designate the number of effective rank and file.</P>
<P>If I rightly understand the plan in consideration, it requires for its execution twelve thousand six hundred men rank and file. Besides these,—to open passages through a wilderness for the march of the several bodies of troops,—to provide the means of long and difficult transportations by land and water,—to establish posts of communication for the security of our con∣voys,—to build and man vessels of force necessary for acquiring a superiority on the lakes;—these and many other purposes pe∣culiar to these enterprises, which would be tedious in detail,—will demand a much larger proportion of artificers and persons to be employed in manual and laborious offices, than are usual in the ordinary course of military operations. When we add the whole together, the aggregate number of men requisite for the service of the ensuing campaign will be little less than dou∣ble the number heretofore in the field: but to be more certain in the calculation, it may be placed at only one half more.</P>
<P>Experience is the only rule to judge by in the present case.—Every expedient has been exhausted in the preceding cam∣paigns to raise men; and it was found impossible to get toge∣ther a greater force than we had, though the safety and success
<PB N="285" REF="031423_0581_0FEC5F9F02A8ADE8"/>
of the cause seemed absolutely to require it. The natural and direct inference therefore is, that the resources of the country were inadequate to a larger supply. I cannot then see that we can hope upon any principle to be equal to so much greater ex∣ertions next year, when the people and the army appear to grow daily more tired of the war, and the depreciation of our money continually increasing, and of consequence proving a smaller temptation to induce them to engage.</P>
<P>The state of our supplies for transporting and subsisting the troops will stand upon a footing equally bad. We have encoun∣tered extreme difficulties in these respects, and have found that it was full as much as we were competent to, to food the army we have already had, and enable it to keep the field and perform the movements required by the contingencies of the service. It is not likely that these difficulties will diminish; but on the con∣trary they will rather multiply as the value of our currency les∣sens: and the enormous prices to which provisions have risen, and the artificial scarcity created by monopolies, with what we have to fear from the effect of the same spirit, give us no reason to flatter ourselves that our future prospects can be much bet∣ter.</P>
<P>In this situation of things we are hardly warranted to expect that we shall have it in our power to satisfy the demands of num∣bers so much greater than we have yet had to supply, especially if we consider that the scene of our operations has hitherto been in the heart of the country furnishing our resources, which of course facilitated the drawing them out,—and that we shall then be carrying on the war at an immense distance, in a coun∣try wild and uncultivated, incapable of affording any aid, and great part of it hostile. We cannot in this case depend on tem∣porary or occasional supplies, as we have been accustomed, but must have ample magazines laid up beforehand. The labor and expense in forming these, and transporting the necessary stores of every kind for the use of the troops, will be increased to a degree that can be more easily conceived than described. The transportation must be, a great part of the way, through deserts affording no other forage than herbage; and, from this circum∣stance, our principal subsistence of the flesh kind must be salted, which would not only be an additional expense in the addition∣al consumption of so scarce and dear an article as salt, but would greatly increase the difficulty both of providing and transporting. My letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo (transmitting a copy of one from the quarter-master-general) which I had the honor of addressing to Congress, and to which I wish to refer, will point
<PB N="286" REF="031423_0582_0FEC6080F9BDC8B8"/>
out the difficulties and daily expense attending our supplies of the article of flour only, in our present circumstances, exclusive of its cost,—and lay the foundation for a fort of comparative estimate to be formed of those that would attend the support of troops when employed at so great a distance.</P>
<P>If, in addition to all this, we should have the French fleet to supply during the winter,—the likelihood of which I have no sufficient information to ground a judgment upon,—it will ap∣pear still more impracticable to furnish the supplies requisite for the extensive operations proposed. But, independent of this, the improbability of doing it is, in my apprehension, infi∣nitely too great to justify the undertaking.</P>
<P>This reasoning is founded on the supposition that the enemy do not evacuate their present posts at New-York and Rhode-Island: nor can we presume upon any past appearances so far as to determine the contrary, and enter into a national contract, the fulfilment of which at any rate, in my judgment, will de∣pend on this event. Opinions on the subject are various, and the arguments on both sides cogent. Circumstances have hi∣therto been very indecisive:—at Rhode-Island there is nothing that looks like an evacuation, that I have heard of:—at New-York, the length of time that has elapsed since the event has been expected, which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for, it not a little doubtful and problematical.</P>
<P>But if it were even certain that the enemy would shortly leave these states, I should think our ability to carry on the expedi∣tions meditated (from the nature of the country, and the remote∣ness from the source of our supplies, joined to the discouraging situation of our finances) too precarious to authorise a precon∣certed agreement with a foreign power, binding ourselves to the attempt. On the other hand, if we were certain of doing our part, a co-operation by the French would, in my opinion, be as delicate and precarious an enterprise as can be imagined. All the reasons, which induce France and the United States to wish to wrest Canada and Halifax from the dominion of England, o∣perate with her perhaps more forcibly to use every possible effort for their defence. The loss of them would be a deadly blow to her trade and empire. To hope to find them in a defenceless state, must be founded in a supposition of the total incapacity of Britain both by land and sea to afford them protection.—I should apprehend we may run into a dangerous error by esti∣mating her power so low.</P>
<P>We have been informed that a strong garrison has been late∣ly sent to Halifax, amounting, by report, to about four thousand
<PB N="287" REF="031423_0583_0FEC6085816FFB20"/>
men:—a part of the detachments which the enemy are now making from New-York are currently said to be, and in all pro∣bability are, destined for that place:—if they evacuate entirely, a very considerable part of their force will no doubt go there;—and in any case we may expect that reinforcements will be thrown from thence into Canada early in the spring. The En∣glish are now greatly superior to the French by sea in America, and will from every appearance continue so unless Spain inter∣pose,—an event which I do not know we are authorised to count upon. However, as I am destitute of information with respect to the present state of European politics, this is a point upon which I can form but an imperfect judgment: but if it should not take place. I think it infinitely probable, from the maritime situation and advantages of Halifax, which is represented as the finest port and best naval arsenal in America,—from the secu∣rity it is calculated to give to the general trade and possessions of Britain, both on the continent and in the West-Indies,—that it will be a station for a larger naval force than the one intended to to convoy the French troops:—it will naturally be the principal rendezvous of the British ships of war in Ameri∣ca. If this position be admitted,—should the English have any knowledge or even suspicion of the design of the French court to send a fleet up the river Saint Laurence, nothing will be easier than to intercept this fleet on its way, or to take or destroy it after it has got in. Nor can we flatter ourselves with keeping this business a secret. Congress perhaps will be surprised to be told that it is already in more hands than they suspect: and, in the progress of the negotiation in France, it will get into many more. The preparations will announce the intention.—It is indeed a part of the plan to avow the destina∣tion of the French troops, though this is to be contradicted by the manner of their clothing, &amp;c.—The stationing troops this winter, as is proposed, particularly on the Mohawk and Con∣necticut river, would be unequivocal proops of the design: it must at least excite the strongest suspicion, so as to put the En∣glish nation upon their guard, and make them take precautions to counteract it.</P>
<P>But if the French troops should arrive before Quebec, I think their success against that strong place, fortified by every advantage of nature and of art, would be extremely doubtful.—It is supposed this capital post will be found in so weak a con∣dition as to make its surrender a matter of course, owing to the enemy's having previously drained themselves for the defence of Detroit, Niagara, Saint John's, Montreal, &amp;c. but we cannot
<PB N="288" REF="031423_0584_0FEC60900897A948"/>
depend that this will be the case:—they may esteem it the part of prudence rather to sacrifice or at least to hazard the extremi∣ties in order to collect their strength at the heart. Montreal indeed, and the posts essential to it, must be defended, because the possession of them would throw too large a part of the coun∣try into our hands. But if reinforcements are sent to Canada early in the spring,—a circumstance extremely likely,—these may be attended to without too far weakening the garrison at Quebec; and, as before observed, we cannot build upon their conduct's being regulated by an ignorance of our plans. The French troops instead of a coup-de-main, would in this case be reduced to the necessity of carrying on a blockade.</P>
<P>I will now take the liberty to turn my attention towards the operations of our own troops. The one against Detroit I shall at present say nothing about: if well conducted, I should hope that place would fall without very great difficulty.—The case is very different with respect to Niagara. This, I am informed, is one of the strongest fortresses in America, and can only be reduced by regular approaches or by famine. In accomplish∣ing this, last war, and a conquest as far as Montreal, I believe general Amherst exhausted two campaigns, with all the advan∣tages which he derived from the united efforts of Britain and America, with every convenience for water-transportation, in∣cluding plenty of seamen, and with money that commanded every thing which either country could furnish. The former mode would require great perseverance, time, and labor, and an ap∣paratus which it would be almost impracticable to transport. The latter is practicable, but very difficult. To effect it, we must gain a superiority on the lakes, The enemy have already a respectable force there:—if they suspect our design, which they cannot fail to do from the measures to be taken, they may improve the interval in adding to it; and, by providing mate∣rials and artificers upon the spot, they may be able to increase it so as to keep pace with us. It is therefore easy to see that we ought not to be too sanguine in the success of this expedition, and that, if a moderate force be imployed in the defence of Nia∣gara without degarnishing Quebec and the intermediate posts, its reduction will be a very arduous task.</P>
<P>The body of troops to penetrate by way of the river Saint Francis must meet with great obstacles: they will have a march of about a hundred and fifty miles from Cohoss, which is about a hundred and sixty miles beyond Hartford, a great part of which is through a hitherto-uninhabited and trackless country, with an immense train of waggons: all the stores and provisions
<PB N="289" REF="031423_0585_0FEC5F24103B4218"/>
for the whole march, and the future supply of the troops, at least till they should get footing in Canada, must accompany them from the beginning. The impediments and delays in such a march almost exceed conception.</P>
<P>When arrived at the Saint Laurence, fresh obstacles proba∣bly would present themselves. The presumption is, that, if the enemy could not make head there, they would desolate the country through which they were to pass, destroy all the provision and forage, remove every kind of water craft, and demolish the materials for building others. These precautions being taken on the Sorelle and Saint Laurence would pretty effectually ob∣struct our progress both to Montreal and Cadoroqui,—to say no∣thing of the rapidity of the current and the numerous rifts be∣tween Montreal and Lagalette.</P>
<P>When we deliberately consider all the obstacles in the execu∣tion, and the difficulties we shall find in preparing the vast ma∣gazines required, which have been already enumerated, if with∣in the compass of our resources, we shall be led to think it not very improbable that this body may be unable to penetrate Ca∣nada, at least in time to co-operate with the French troops, if a co-operation should be necessary. The situation of these troops then would be delicate and dangerous:—exposed to a defeat from the united force of the enemy, in great danger of having their retreat cut off by a superior naval force in the river, they would have every thing to fear. On the other hand, if our ope∣rations should be as successful as we may flatter ourselves, a tempest or a British fleet may deprive us of our expected aid; and at a critical moment we may find ourselves in the bosom of an enemy's country, obliged to combat their whole force with one inferior and reduced by a tedious and wasting march. The five thousand men, when they arrived in Canada, would proba∣bly little exceed four capable of service; and would be still less, if out of them we should establish posts as we advanced, to in∣sure a retreat and protect escorts of provision which must follow for future support. Thus an accident in either case would in∣volve the defeat of the whole project; and the catastrophe might be attended with the most unhappy consequences to America.</P>
<P>The plan proposed appears to me not only too extensive and beyond our abilities, but too complex. To succeed, it requires such a fortunate coincidence of circumstances as could hardly be hoped, and cannot be relied on;—the departure of the ene∣my from these states, without which we cannot furnish the stipu∣lated force, or supplies to maintain them,—such a want of pow∣er or want of foresight in the enemy as will oblige then to ne∣glect
<PB N="290" REF="031423_0586_0FEC604E55109BD0"/>
the reinforcement of Halifax and of Canada, and prevent them, however conveniently situated, from the disputing the passage of the four ships of the line and four frigates up the ri∣ver Saint Laurence, or attempting their destruction afterwards,—such a combination of favourable incidents as will enable se∣veral bodies acting separately and independently by sea and land, and from different countries, to conform to times and periods so as to ensure a co-operation;—these and many other circum∣stances must conspire, to give success to the enterprise.</P>
<P>Congress, I am persuaded, had powerful reasons for fixing the convoy at the number they have: and their superior informati∣on respecting the affairs of Europe at this present juncture ena∣bles them to judge much better than I can pretend to do, of its sufficiency. But from the imperfect view I have of the mat∣ter, I have been led, in considering the subject, to look upon it as insufficent. From the general tenor of intelligence, the En∣glish out-number the French in the channel: in America, both on the continent and in the islands, they are greatly superior. If the last Toulon fleet is employed in the Mediterranean, the French may have the superiority there: but, upon the whole, the balance of naval force seems hitherto to be on the side of the English. If we add to this that the number of ships of war in the French ports, built or building, bears no comparison to the number in the English ports,—and that Britain notwith∣standing the diminution she has suffered, is still a kingdom of great maritime resources,—we shall be disposed to conclude that the preponderance is too likely to continue where it is. The interposition of Spain indeed would make a very interesting change; but her backwardness heretofore seems to be an argu∣ment that she is withheld from interfering by some weighty poli∣tical motives: and how long these may continue to restrain her, is a question I am unqualified to determine.</P>
<P>Besides these general objections to the plan which have been stated, there appear to me to be some particular ones which I shall take the liberty to point out.</P>
<P>In the first place I observe there are to be five thousand mili∣tia employed in the two expeditions against Detroit and Niaga∣ra.—The drawing into service so large a number composed chiefly of husbandmen, in addition to what may be found neces∣sary for other exigencies on the coast at so interesting a season of the year, will certainly be very injurious to the culture of our lands, and must tend to add to the deficiency of supplies. But this, though not to be overlooked, is not the principal ob∣jection.—In the expedition against Detroit, militia perhaps may
<PB N="291" REF="031423_0587_0FEC6007699026E8"/>
answer, as it is not a post of very great strength, and may possi∣bly be abandoned on or in a little time after the approach of a force that cannot be opposed in the field, and the garrison pro∣ceed to reinforce that of Niagara. But even here troops of another kind would be far preferable. However, the case will be very different with respect to this last:—it is, as I have be∣fore mentioned, one of the strongest fortresses of America, and demands for its reduction the very best of troops. Militia have neither patience nor perseverance for a siege. This has been demonstrated by all the experience we have had. An attempt to carry on one which should materially depend on them would be liable to be frustrated by their inconstancy in the most criti∣cal moments.—Agreeable to the plan under consideration, three thousand five hundred out of five thousand six hundred are to be militia.</P>
<P>It is a part of the plan that the troops sent against Detroit, whe∣ther successful or not, are to form a junction with those at Nia∣gara. It appears to me on the contrary, that the expedition a∣gainst Detroit, under the present arrangement, must stand on its own bottom, and have no other object than the reducing that place and destroying the adjacent Indian settlements. Lake Erie is certainly occupied by two armed vessels of sixteen and eighteen guns, and, it is said, by five or six others of smaller size, having two, three, or four guns each, which, while the ene∣my hold Niagara, will prevent the communication of our troops by way of the lake,—to say nothing for want of batteaux for transportation. A communication by land must be performed through an extent of more than four hundred miles, and a great part of this at least under many disadvantages of route, and through tribes of hostile Indians.</P>
<P>My knowledge of the country is not sufficiently accurate to enable me to discover the reasons which determined Congress to divide the force destined against Niagara, and to appoint the march of one body from Ononguaga to that place. It seems to me however that this disposition might be subject to one great inconvenience, which is, that, if each column be not superior to the whole collective force of the enemy, they risk being beaten separately and successively, besides the trouble and expense of preparing as it were for two expeditions instead of one,—of opening two roads instead of one,—and the uncertainty of a co-operation (if no disaster should happen to either) at the mo∣ment when it might be necessary. The inquiries I have as yet had it in my power to make are opposed to the practicability of conveying cannon in the route from Ononguaga to Niagara, or
<PB N="292" REF="031423_0588_0FEC60921B1CBC20"/>
at least place it as a point infinitely doubtful: and, without can∣non, nothing can be effected against that post. Upon the whole, the great matter essential to success against Niagara is to subdue the enemy's force on lakes Eric and Ontario, particularly the latter. This once done, and the garrison by that means cut off from its supplies, the fort will be likely to fall an easy prey. Here our efforts should be directed: nor do I at present perceive the purposes to be answered by the body going from Ononguaga, unless the devastation of the intermediate Indian villages be the object,—which perhaps may not be equal to the risk, labor, and expense, and the more so as they would fall of course if we should succeed in the general operation.</P>
<P>The cantoning five thousand troops this winter on Connecti∣cut-river, under our present prospects, will, in my opinion be impracticable, and, in any case, unadvisable.—When I had the honor of writing to Congress in September last on the subject of a winter campaign into Canada, I had been led by [<HI>colonel</HI>] Bai∣ley, and other gentlemen acquainted with the country, to ex∣pect that very considerable magazines of provisions might be laid up on the upper parts of that river. But it appears on ex∣periment that their zeal for the expedition made them too san∣guine in the matter. The purchases fall far short of what was expected. The difficulties of transportation, as represented by the quarter-masters and commissaries, supported by facts that speak for themselves, are so great and so complicated that I should have no hope of being able, from remote parts of the continent, to throw in the quantity requisite for subsisting these troops during the winter, and at the same time of forming the magazines which would be necessary to prosecute the expedition in spring. We may be endeavouring to form the magazines: but the troops cannot be on the spot this winter; otherwise they will exhaust the provision as fast as it can be collected.—The same objection applies to the stationing troops on the Mohawk∣river.</P>
<P>In estimating our force for the next campaign, it is to be considered that upwards of four thousand of the present army will have completed their terms of service by the last of May next, and that a great proportion of the remainder will have done the same about the close of the ensuing fall, unless they can be induced to re-engage,—of which the ill success of our present exertions to enlist those whose engagements are about to expire afford but an unfavorable prospect. This and the general temper of the officers, dissatisfied much with their situ∣ation,
<PB N="293" REF="031423_0589_0FEC6054CC49C468"/>
will suggest a strong argument against the extensive pro∣jects in contemplation.</P>
<P>In whatever point of light the subject is placed, our ability to perform our part of the contract appears to me infinitely too doubtful and precarious to justify the undertaking, A failure, as I have already observed, would involve consequences too de∣licate and disagreeable to be hazarded. But, at the same time that my judgment is against this, I am clearly of opinion that we should attempt every thing that our circumstances will per∣mit: but, as the extent of our power must be regulated by many possible events, I would wish to hold ourselves free to act according to either possibility, and as a clearer view of our fu∣ture resources may authorise.—If the enemy entirely leave these states, it will produce a vast change in our affairs; and new prospects may open, of which we can at present have but a very imperfect idea. It would be a great step towards raising the value of our money, which would give a new spring to our military operations.—We may be able to undertake much more than we can now foresee.</P>
<P>If the enemy attempt to keep posts in these states, a primary object will be to expel them if in our power:—if not we must make proper provision to bar their depredations, and must turn our attention to the security of our frontiers, by pursuing such measures as shall be within the reach of our abilities.—Though we may not be able to launch into so wide a field as we could wish, something upon a more particular scale may be enterpris∣ed. Detroit and Niagara may perhaps be reduced, though Canada may not be an accession to the confederacy.—With a view to what is possible, preparations may be going on, and we can make such an application of them as we shall find practica∣ble.</P>
<P>As there is no time to be lost in doing this, I shall give the necessary orders so far as relates to the article of provision, which indeed has been already done it part. Magazines of forage, materials for boat and ship building, and other articles, must also be provided,—which will depend on the final arrange∣ments and more definitive instructions of Congress. These measures will be necessary to be taken whether the present plan is carried on, or whether something less extensive, depend∣ing wholly on ourselves, is substituted in its place.—I shall wait the further orders of Congress for the government of my conduct in delivering the plan to the marquis as their resolution seems to require, or in transmitting it immediately to doctor Franklin as the letter from the committee seems to direct. At

<P>I HAD the honor of receiving your favor of the sixth yesterday, with the inclosed copy of a letter from the president of the council of New-Jersey, relative to an expected attack upon the western frontier of that state.—I have just received a letter from general Hand giving intelligence of an attack up∣on colonel Alden's regiment at Cherry-Valley, effected by surprise, in consequence of which, there is too much reason to apprehend that regiment may fall a sacrifice. I transmit a copy of the dispatches announcing this disagreeable affair.</P>

<P>BY the time this reaches you, general Du Portail will probably be at Philadelphia. One part of his business is to prosecute the directions given him some time since for forming a plan for the defence of the river Delaware, to be submitted to Congress: another part is to understand from Congress what may be their views and wishes with respect to his further conti∣nuance in America, and that of the three other gentlemen at∣tached to him.</P>
<P>He informs me that the furlough he obtained from the court of France expires in February next, and that, unless there is a certain prospect of his being employed hereafter in a manner useful to the states and honorable to himself, he intends imme∣diately to return. He therefore wishes some explicit ideas to be realised on the subject. He is also anxious that something definitive should be done with respect to the pay and the other appointments both of himself and the other gentlemen with him, which have been hitherto undecided, and have left them in an uncertain and disagreeable situation.—Added to this, he is desirous to have some arrangement fixed for the rules and manner of service in his department.</P>
<P>He delivered me, some days since, a memorial intended for Congress, and which I have now the honor to inclose, contain∣ing his ideas on a general system of fortification for these states, and which he requested me to accompany with my sentiments.
<PB N="297" REF="031423_0593_0FEC5F4A27ACE410"/>
But it includes questions of finance and considerations of policy the most extensive and important, of which Congress alone can form a competent judgment. I shall therefore only say, that, considered merely in a military point of view, the plan appears to me worthy of very serious attention.</P>
<P>It is but justice to general Du Portail to observe that I have a high opinion of his merit and abilities, and esteem him not only well acquainted with the particular branch he professes, but a man of sound judgment and real knowledge in military science in general. I have also a very favorable opinion of the other gentlemen. I will take the liberty to add that it appears to me that it will be extremely necessary and useful in our fu∣ture operations, whether directed to offence or defence,—whe∣ther to dispossess the enemy of posts in our front, to assist in carrying on the proposed expedition into Canada, or any other on a less extensive plan which may be substituted in its stead for the mere security of our frontier.</P>
<P>Monsieur De Murnon has served in quality of engineer under general Du Portail since the first of March last, with the pro∣mise of a majority from the committee of arrangement at Val∣ley-Forge. He has never yet received his commission. This, I presume, has been forgotten in a crowd of more important af∣fairs.—With the greatest respect and esteem, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>MR. Wheelock will have the honor of presenting this let∣ter to your excellency. He waits on Congress upon the affairs of a regiment under the command of colonel Bedel, which, it seems, was raised in the Cohoss county, or at least has been
<PB N="298" REF="031423_0594_0FEC60A3C6965720"/>
kept up since March last upon the recommendation of the mar∣quis Fayette when at Albany. This corps, according to the inclosed state by Mr. Wheelock, who is the lieutenant-colonel, to which I beg leave to refer Congress, and according to other information I have received, was at first assembled under the direction of major-general Gates about this time twelvemonth, for the purpose of a sudden enterprise against St. John's, and the enemy's armed vessels lying there, and was engaged till the last of March.</P>
<P>I cannot undertake to say in what manner or how usefully this regiment has been employed, or to what extent in point of men. But Mr. Wheelock says it has been of great service: and the object of his present journey is to obtain the direction of Congress for their being paid when proper rolls are produced, and their determination whether it is to be disbanded now, or continued till April next, the period for which the men are said to have engaged, though the marquis's recommendation extend∣ed only to the end of the present campaign.</P>
<P>The regiment may or may not be necessary in future. Much will depend on the system of conduct the enemy pursue the next campaign, and on our own operations. I would observe, under its present engagement, its services were to be local, or at least confined to a certain quarter. If it should be deemed expedi∣ent to re-enlist it, if practicable it should be done on the gene∣ral scale of acting wherever it may be requisite (though perhaps it may not be possible to accomplish it): and, in such case, it will also be material for the public to have a more perfect know∣ledge of its arrangements than what I apprehend it has hither∣to had.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>YOUR excellency's letter of the eighteenth, with the in∣closure referred to, came to hand yesterday.—I had before re∣ceived the intelligence contained in Mr. Deane's letter, and in consequence made part of the detachments which have been mentioned in my late letters. It is highly probable that the
<PB N="300" REF="031423_0596_0FEC60B41DE8A1A8"/>
late incursions and outrages were committed by the parties com∣prehended in Mr. Deane's intelligence; and I should hope that the force already gone from the army, together with the season, will prevent them at least from making further great depreda∣tions.</P>
<P>Since I had the honor of addressing your excellency on the twenty-first, I received a letter from general Hand, of the eigh∣teenth, an extract from which you will find inclosed, with copies of a letter from major Whiting and one from a Mr. Clyde.—These will inform Congress, that, though the ravages at Cher∣ry-Valley settlement were great in the late attack by the sava∣ges, yet our loss was much less than we had reason to apprehend it from our former advices. The account of the enemy's hav∣ing stormed the fort, and cut off Alden's regiment, happily turns out premature. The inclosure, No. 2, which is a copy of a letter from lord Stirling of the seventeenth, will advise Congress that the fleet of transports, which had lain at the Hook for some days before, came up the preceding night to the wa∣tering-place, and also that some of the ships of war had return∣ed to York dismasted.—Your excellency will also see by the inclosure, No. 3, (which contains an extract from a letter from general Sullivan, of the eighteenth instant) the latest advices I have respecting admiral Biron's fleet.—From the loss of the Somerset, and these several accounts, they suffered severely in their late cruise.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 24.—I just received from general Hand the inclos∣ed petition from major Whitcomb, addressed to Congress, and his letter to general Hand, of the same date. My information respecting the corps under major Whitcomb's command has hi∣therto been very imperfect; and even now I do not know the terms on which it was engaged: nor had I, till these letters came to hand, any reason to think that the troops above had not all been equally paid, having sent up a supply of money for the purpose soon after I came to this camp, and authorised the paymaster-general a few days ago to forward a further quantity.—I shall immediately write to general Clinton, now on his way to Albany, to send a proper officer to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;ter the corps, and al∣so three companies (which he calls provincials) under his direc∣tion, said to be engaged to the first of next month; after which, both will be paid on his presenting proper rolls.—With respect to clothing, the only application I recollect to have had from major Whitcomb was answered with such supplies, both in quan∣tity and quality, as our stores would admit of. It may perhaps be practicable hereafter to put his corps on a better footing in this instance.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="031423_0597_0FEC60B614F6A748"/>
The alarm which major Whitcomb speaks of in the beginning of his letter to general Hand was occasioned (as Congress will perceive by a copy of another letter from him to general Hand) by a descent made by a body of men in the country about the south end of lake Champlain, and who, according to his report, have done considerable damage.</P>
<P>I directed general Portail some time ago to take a view of the works carrying on in the Highlands for the defence of the North-river, and to make an estimate of the cannon necessary for the purpose. This he did: and, as he is now at Philadel∣phia, I have written to him by this conveyance, and requested him to present the estimate to Congress. I am sorry the num∣ber wanted is so great, and the more so as I find upon inquiry that the Salisbury furnace in Connecticut, which used to cast so many, is much out of repair, and could not possibly be put in order, and in a proper state for supplies, before May.—The providing of cannon is a matter of infinite importance; and I am persuaded Congress will take every means in their power to accomplish it. Besides the pressing and extensive demand for the works on the North-river, we cannot extend our views too soon to the obtaining further large supplies. We must in the course of things have occasion for a great deal of artillery: and, in any enterprise we may undertake against Canada, whether on a large or small scale, several peices of various calibers will be absolutely essential. Besides arming the ships and vessels we shall be obliged to build to gain the navigation of the lakes, our land operations will require a great number.</P>
<P>A detachment of continental troops will conduct those of the convention from the North-river to the Delaware. The Ger∣man battalion is to compose part of the escort: and, after the convention troops cross to Pennsylvania, I have directed it, in consequence of the intelligence transmitted of late by Congress respecting the frontiers, to proceed to Easton with all its bag∣gage, where it is to wait till general Hand arrives at the Mini∣sinks, and whence it will be ready to act as circumstances may require. At the same time, if these frequent detachments from the army could be avoided, it were much to be wished. The troops will be by this means in a very dispersed state; and, be∣sides losing perhaps some advantages which might present them∣selves if they were more collected, their discipline will be great∣ly injured, and it will be extremely difficult, from a variety of causes, to draw them together again: and, if it should be prac∣ticable, it is highly probable we shall find their number much impaired by desertion and otherwise.</P>

<P>MR. John Dodge will have the honor of delivering this letter to your excellency. His history is that he is a native of Connecticut, and about eight years ago, as he informs me, set∣tled in the country between Detroit and Pittsburg as an Indian trader;—that he carried on commerce till January 1776, when, for his attachment to our cause and the measures he had taken to promote it, be became obnoxious to the enemy, was seized by order of the governor of Detroit, was thrown into prison, and there continued till the beginning of May last, when he was sent to Quebec;—that on the ninth of October he escaped from thence and got into our settlements, through the aid of a French Caghnewaga who came with him here on friday last.</P>
<P>I find Mr. Dodge an intelligent young man, intimately ac∣quainted with all the tract of country between Pittsburg and Detroit, and with that lying on Lake Erie, also with most of the savage tribes in those parts, and with their languages. He is likewise well acquainted with the communication from Fort-Stanwix to O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wego and Niagara.</P>
<P>I believe Mr. Dodge's history to be true; and, from a vari∣ety of circumstances, I am persuaded of his firm attachment to us: and I would take the liberty to suggest to Congress that I think he may be of very important service to us in any enter∣prise we may undertake in the western quarter, or against the force on Lake Erie or Lake Ontario. This consideration, with that of his losses and sufferings which I am inclined to believe have been considerable, seems to make him worthy of notice and attention.—His information is good and clear in several points which I know myself, and in many others (from the manner in which he delivered it) far superior and much more satisfactory than what I have been able to derive from any other person.—As I have observed before, Mr. Dodge appears to me a valuable intelligencer; and, if Congress are pleased to honor him with an opportunity, he will give them an account of the posts of Detroit and Niagara when he left them, and of that at Michilimachinac,—of the enemy's naval force on Lakes Erie and Ontario, and of such other matters in Canada as he was a∣ble to inform himself of, either by his own observation or the relation of others.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday honored with your favor of the twenti∣eth, with its several inclosures.—Congress will be pleased to accept my acknowledgments for the communication of the trea∣ties between his most christian majesty and the United States. The resolve respecting the exchange of prisoners has been transmitted to sir Henry Clinton, and I have appointed com∣missioners (if he thinks proper) to meet his at Amboy the se∣venth of next month.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to inform Congress that the whole army (one brigade and the light corps excepted) is now in motion to the places of their respective cantonments for winter-quar∣ters. I have thought it prudent to delay this event a while, to give time for the convention troops to make some progress in crossing the North-river, to prevent a possibility of accident. The third division passes this day; and, if no unexpected inter∣ruption happens, the whole will be over, the thirtieth instant. When their passage is completed, the remaining troops kept in the field will immediately retire to quarters.</P>
<P>The disposition for winter-quarters is as follows:—Nine bri∣gades will be stationed on the west side of Hudson's river ex∣clusive of the garrison at West-Point,—one of which (the North-Carolina brigade) will be near Smith's Clove for the security of that pass, and as a reinforcement to West-Point in case of necessity; another (the Jersey brigade) will be at Eli∣zabethtown, to cover the lower part of Jersey; and the other seven, consisting of the Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania troops, will be at Middlebrook.—Six brigades will be left on the east side of the river and at West-Point;—three of which (of the Massachusetts troops) will be stationed for the immediate defence of the Highlands; one at West-Point in ad∣dition to the garrison already there; and the other two at Fish∣kill and the Continental Village.—The remaining three bri∣gades, composed of the New-Hampshire and Connecticut troops, and Hazen's regiment, will be posted in the vicinity of Dan∣bury, for the protection of the country lying along the Sound,
<PB N="304" REF="031423_0600_0FEC60C7438EF708"/>
to cover our magazines lying on Connecticut-river, and to aid the Highlands on any serious movement of the enemy that way.—The park of artillery will be at Pluckenim.—The ca∣valry will be disposed of thus:—Bland's regiment at Winches∣ter in Virginia, Baylor's at Frederic or Hagarstown in Mary∣land, Moylan's at Lancaster in Pennsylvania, and Sheldon's at Durham in Connecticut. Lee's corps will be with that part of the army which is in the Jerseys acting on the advanced posts.—This comprehends the general distribution of the army, except Clinton's brigade of New-York troops, Pulaski's corps, and some detached regiments and corps stationed at Albany and at different parts of the frontier, of which Congress have already been particularly advised.—General Putnam will com∣mand at Danbury, General M'Dougal in the Highlands, and my own quarters will be in the Jerseys, in the neighborhood of Middlebrook.</P>
<P>This disposition appeared to me best calculated to conciliate as far as possible these several objects,—the protection of the country, the security of the important posts in the Highlands, the safety, discipline, and easy subsistence of the army.—To have kept the troops in a collected state would have increased infinitely the expense and difficulty of subsisting them, both with respect to forage and provisions: to have divided them into smaller cantonments would have made it far less practica∣ble to maintain order and discipline among them, and would have put them less in a condition to control and prevent offen∣sive operations on the side of the enemy, or to assemble to take advantage of any favorable opening which their future situation may offer, should they be obliged to weaken themselves by further detachments so far as to invite an enterprise against them.</P>
<P>By the estimate of the quarter-master and commissary-gene∣ral, it appears indispensable to have the principal part of the army on the other side of the North-river. It was thought impracticable to furnish the necessary supplies of flour for the whole, on this side the river, from the immense difficulty and expense of transportation in the winter season, and from the ex∣hausted state of the country with respect to forage.—As this subject has been already fully before Congress, I shall not trou∣ble them with a repetition of the detail.—In order as much as possible to reduce the demand of forage and facilitate the supplies, I have given directions, when the several divisions ar∣rive at their cantonments, to send away to convenient places at a distance from them all the horses not absolutely requisite to carry on the ordinary business of the army.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="031423_0601_0FEC6098EF259098"/>
It is unnecessary to add that the troops must again have re∣course to the expedient of hutting as they did last year. But, as they are now well clad, and we have had more leisure to make some little preparations for winter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I hope they will be in a more comfortable situation than they were in the preceding winter.—With the highest respect and esteem, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BETWEEN Fredericsburg and this place where I arri∣ved yesterday afternoon, I had the honor to receive your ex∣cellency's several favors of the twenty-sixth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-eighth, in due order, with their several inclosures, which shall have my attention. My being on the road from the time of their coming to hand till yesterday prevented me from acknowledging them before.</P>
<P>As many inconveniences would attend the removing of the sick officers and men of the convention troops by land, and the officers having families, I have written to general Gates to per∣mit them to proceed to the falls of James'-river by water, on the officers' giving their paroles that they and the men will perform the voyage. I have also acquainted him of the meet∣ing in contemplation for an exchange of prisoners, that the offi∣cers may not leave Boston till the result is known.</P>
<P>With respect to major De Passern of the regiment of Hesse-Hanau, I hope he may be released by an exchange; after which, it will remain with him to obtain liberty from sir Henry Clinton to return to Europe. But if the exchange in agitation should not take place, I should be happy if Congress themselves would decide whether he is to be allowed his request.—If on my per∣mission he should go to Europe without application to and the consent of the British commander (which seems to be his inten∣tion), the enemy might not think themselves bound upon a fu∣ture occasion to account for him.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to address you by command of his excellency, who went from this place at four o'clock this morn∣ing in consequence of advice received last night that fifty-two vessels great and small, including a bomb-ketch, with troops on board, had the day before yesterday, moved up the North-river
<PB N="306" REF="031423_0602_0FEC47BE745C57B8"/>
as far as Cloyster-landing, and yesterday morning got under way and were proceeding farther up. He proposed to make his first stage at Acquakenunk, and to proceed as his future intelligence might require. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much at a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> determine the design of the enemy, but thinks it may either have respect to the forts in the Highlands or to the convention troops.</P>
<P>When he left Peekskill, the two Massachusetts brigades, on their march thither from Hartford, were not arrived, so that the troops on the spot were only the original garrison of West-Point, and Nixon's brigade which lay near the Continental Village: but, without the most inexplicable delay, those must have reach∣ed their destination some days since. If so, and the enemy should meditate a stroke against West-Point, they will probably fail in it unless there should be something like a surprise.—The general also thinks it probable that the Maryland division were yesterday evening at the Clove. Their instructions were, to communicate with West-Point and reinforce it on any emergency. They were, in addition to them, directed last night by express to move immediately towards the forts, divested of baggage and artillery, for the more speedy communication.—The Carolina brigade has been some time stationed at the entrance of the Clove.</P>
<P>One brigade of the Virginia troops is at Pompton, and the other two were expected to reach Springfield yesterday. The Pennsylvania troops, it is supposed, would be at Acquakenunk or in the neighborhood of Paramus.—These troops, immedi∣ately on receiving the present intelligence, were ordered to halt; and his excellency is gone forward to regulate their movements according to circumstances.—The brigade in this town is order∣ed to hold itself in readiness.</P>
<P>If the convention troops should be their object, 'tis probable the attempt will be too late to answer any purpose: the rear di∣vision was to cross the North-river on wednesday last, but must certainly have done it on thursday; the front must be not far from the Delaware; and the whole too far advanced to be sub∣ject to a risque. Added to this, there is a pretty strong guard with each division. His excellency however has sent on the in∣telligence to colonel Bland who directs their march, urging him to hasten them forward with all possible dispatch.</P>
<P>One brigade of Connecticut troops was at Danbury, the other at Fredericsburg, when we came away; and general Poor's was in full march for the former, and must long since have arrived.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor of receiving yours of the second at this place.—I have forwarded the brevet to captain Simonet; and shall take such measures in regard to colonel Fleury's letter as shall seem proper, upon my arrival at Middlebrook for which I shall set out again to-morrow.</P>
<P>Upon leaving Elizabethtown I directed colonel Harrison to inform you of the intelligence I had received, and which I thought demanded my personal attention, as the enemy appear∣ed to be going up the river in considerable force. Having put the troops destined for the Middlebrook cantonment upon their march back towards the North-river, I was proceeding that way myself when an express met me a few miles from this, informing me that the enemy's shipping, which had been as high as King's ferry, had fallen down again. They landed a party at the fer∣ry, and set fire to a few small buildings near the water: but, upon a party of ours advancing, they immediately [<HI>re-embarked.</HI>] without attempting any thing further.—The boats and stores of every kind had been previously secured—I cannot account for this manoenvre but by supposing that they had been misinformed as to the quantity of stores at the ferry, or that they expected to find the posts in a defenceless situation; or it may perhaps have been to favor a forage below.</P>
<P>Finding that the troops destined for the defence of the High∣lands had arrived at their respective posts agreeable to my or∣ders and expectations, I have again put those intended for Mid∣dlebrook into motion; and I hope they will arrive there while the roads and weather are both fine.</P>
<P>Accounts from New-York through a good channel inform me that thirty thousand tons of shipping had been suddenly tak∣en up for government service, and that a general embargo is laid. The occasion has not yet transpired; at least it has not yet reached me.—</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has not been in my power to return an answer to your favor of the sixth instant till now. The letter met me on the road, separated from my papers; and I did not reach this place till late on the eleventh, since which I have been much employ∣ed in attending to the dispositions for hutting the army: but in the mean time the objects of the dispatch have engaged my ut∣most attention.</P>
<P>The earnest desire I have to pay the strictest compliance in every instance with the views and instructions of Congress can∣not but make me feel the greatest uneasiness when I find my∣self in circumstances of hesitation or doubt with respect to their directions. But the perfect confidence I have in the justice and candor of that honorable body emboldens me to communicate without reserve the difficulties which occur in the execution of their present order; and the indulgence I have experienced on every former occasion induces me to imagine that the liberty I now take will not meet with their disapprobation.</P>
<P>I have attentively taken up the report of the committee of the fifth (approved by Congress) on the subject of my letter of the eleventh ultimo on the proposed expedition into Canada: I have considered it in several lights, and sincerely regret that I should feel myself under any embarrassment in carrying it into execution. Still I remain of opinion, from a general review of things and the state of our resources, that no extensive system of co-operation with the French, for the complete emancipation of Canada, can be positively decided on for the ensuing year.—To propose a plan of perfect co-operation with a foreign power with∣out a moral certainty in our supplies, and to have that plan ac∣tually ratified with the court of Versailles, might be attended, in case of failure in the conditions on our part, with very fatal effects.</P>
<P>If I should seem unwilling to transmit the plan as prepared by Congress, with my observations, it is because I find myself under a necessity (in order to give our minister sufficient ground to found an application on) to propose something more than a vague and indecisive plan, which, even in the event of a total evacuation of these states by the enemy, may be rendered im∣practicable in the execution by a variety of insurmountable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or if I retain my present sentiments and act consistently.
<PB N="309" REF="031423_0605_0FEC60A185E7BBE8"/>
I must point out the difficulties as they appear to me; which must embarrass his negotiations, and may disappoint the views of Congress.</P>
<P>But proceeding on the idea of the enemy's leaving these states before the active part of the ensuing campaign, I should fear to hazard a mistake as to the precise aim and extent of the views of Congress. The line of conduct that I am to observe in writing to our minister at the court of France does not ap∣pear sufficiently delineated:—were I to undertake it, I should be much afraid of erring through misconception. In this di∣lemma I would esteem it a particular favor to be excused from writing at all on the subject, especially as it is the part of can∣dor in me to acknowledge that I do not see my way clear e∣nough to point out such a plan for co-operation as I conceive to be consistent with the ideas of Congress, and that will be suffi∣ciently explanatory with respect to time and circumstances, to give efficacy to the measure. But if congress still think it ne∣cessary for me to proceed in the business, I must request their more definitive and explicit instructions, and that they will per∣mit me, previous to transmitting the intended dispatches, to sub∣mit them to their determination.</P>
<P>I could wish to lay before Congress more minutely the state of the army, the condition of our supplies, and the requisites ne∣cessary for carrying into execution an undertaking that may in∣volve the most serious events. If Congress think this can be done more satisfactorily in a personal conference, I hope to have the army in such a situation before I can receive their answer, as to afford me an opportunity of giving my attendance.—I would on∣ly add that I shall cheerfully comply with the directions of Con∣gress relative to making every preparation in our power for an expedition against Niagara, and for such further operations to the northward as time and circumstances shall enable us to carry on. Measures for the purpose have been taken in part for some time past; and I shall pursue them vigorously. The subject has long engaged my contemplation; and I am thoroughly convinc∣ed of the expediency and policy of doing every thing practica∣ble on our part, for giving security to our frontiers by the re∣duction of those places which facilitate annoying them, and even for accomplishing the annexation of Canada to the Union.—</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a letter which I had the honor of receiving from Con∣gress, dated the second instant, was inclosed the copy of one from lieutenant-colonel Fleury, upon the subject of which, the president desired me to express "my sentiments, as also of the merits of Mr. Fleury during his services in the army."</P>
<P>I do not conceive that Congress should request a renewal of colonel Fleury's furlough from the French minister plenipoten∣tiary. An application of that kind ought, in my opinion, to be made by himself, not only because it is customary, but because solicitations of a similar nature would in all probability be made by many not having Mr. Fleury's claim to the favor of the public, and to whom it would be difficult to give a refusal after a precedent had been established. I would not be under∣stood to include the case of general Du Portail and the gentle∣men in the engineering department, who are peculiarly cir∣cumstanced, and in whose behalf I have written particularly to Congress.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Fleury's merits as an officer, I can only repeat what I have upon several occasions mentioned to Congress be∣fore,—that he is brave, active, and intelligent, and that, should he obtain leave to remain in America, I shall take an opportu∣nity (agreeable to my promise to him) of employing him in a manner suitable to his rank, and in such a way as will not clash with the officers of the line.</P>

<P>I HAD the honor of addressing Congress some time since on the subject of general Du Portail and the gentlemen with him. He informs me that his affair has not yet been decided, and is extremely anxious that it should be in some way or o∣ther. He assigns many powerful reasons to shew that it is very interesting to him (if he is not to continue in our service) to return to France as speedily as possible. He also informs me that he has reason to think, in the consideration of his affair, the retaining him in service and the adopting the plan propos∣ed in his memoir are united, and the decision of the one sus∣pended on that of the other; and has therefore requested me to represent to Congress that he should be happy they could be considered separately; and if his services, abstractedly from the project proposed by him, are deemed necessary, it will be agree∣able to him to remain in the country.</P>
<P>I have already taken the liberty to offer my sentiments on the propriety of engaging these gentlemen to continue in the service. It really appears to me that they will be essentially necessary to our future operations, whether defensive or offen∣sive; and it cannot therefore but give me pleasure if it shall be consistent with the views of Congress to retain them, and to give every encouragement which they may reasonably expect.</P>
