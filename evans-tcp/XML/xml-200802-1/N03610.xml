<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Do here, as I proposed in <HI>my last</HI>—, present to your View, a plain Discourse compose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>for you,</HI> and, not long since, preach∣ed <HI>to you</HI>:— The true De∣sign and Scope of which, is, to <HI>quicken,</HI> and <HI>encourage you,</HI> (more especial∣ly) <HI>now,</HI> in your <HI>tender</HI> Yars, to adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour, in all the Instances of a well ordered Conversation, and to <HI>assist you</HI> in so doing: And, in a more peculiar Manner, in those religious Exercises of <HI>PRAYER</HI> and <HI>PRAISE;</HI> the devout and

frequent Practice of which, will be your own greatest H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nour and Ornament —.</P>
<P>I am very sensible, that <HI>the Word</HI> in the <HI>Original</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, which is translated <HI>Children,</HI> in my <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt,</HI> does not <HI>always,</HI> and <HI>only</HI> intend Children <HI>in Years:</HI> Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, we are h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reby to understand, not only <HI>little</HI> Children, but sometimes, either Sons, — Daughters,— Servants, or Maidens; and sometimes, even <HI>all</HI> the Domesticks, excepting the Master and Mistress of the Family <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Leigh</HI>'s Crit.

Hosanna to the Son of David</HI>: "And t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uly, the Praise was <HI>perfected</HI> by the sweet Voices of these <HI>Lambs;</HI> yea, it had been <HI>Defective</HI> if these had been wanting <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 8.2</NOTE>."</P>
<P>It will be very easy for you to observe, that I consider you, in <HI>this</HI> Discourse, not as in your Childhood <HI>only;</HI> but also, as hast'ning on a pace, if your Lives be spared, into the midst of numerous Temptations; and therefore <HI>this little
<PB N="iii" REF="004413_0004_100D4FF7A0E226E0"/>

<P>And, O! that I might be a happy Instru∣ment, in the Hand of my great Lord and Master, not only, of nourishing you up in the Words of Faith, and of good Doctrine; but, moreover, of exciting you to the <HI>practical</HI> Part of our holy Religion, even, to <HI>speak</HI> and <HI>live</HI> the Praises of our exalted Redeemer; and, in all your Ways, to acknowlege <HI>God,</HI> as your <HI>Father</HI> in Heaven; and as the <HI>Guide,</HI> first, of your Childhood, and afterwards, of your Youth, and so on to old Age and even thro' the Shades of Death, and, up to that high and holy Mount, where there shall be no more Death, nor Sorrow nor Crying <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> 21.4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And whereas, there is Duty (with respect to you) in cumbent on your tender <HI>Parents,</HI> as well as on your Minister; I have therefore, in Love to you, as well as in faithfulness to them, offered, in the Close of this Discourse, a Word of Exhortation <HI>to them,</HI> namely <HI>to do all they can</HI> to promote and further <HI>your</HI> spiritual Weal; and in order hereunto, to lead you unto <HI>CHRIST,</HI> and to direct and assist
<PB N="iv" REF="004413_0005_100D4FF9D542AC38"/>
you in his Service—: Which Exhortation will, I doubt not, be well accepted by them; and, as I humbly trust, will be a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans of <HI>Quick'ning</HI> to them.</P>
<P>And I am not without Hope, <HI>my Children,</HI> that the Consideration of the <HI>distinguishing</HI> Goodness and Kindness of God your Saviour, in sparing <HI>you</HI> from Death, <HI>at a Time,</HI> when many Children and Youth, of <HI>this</HI> Town, as well as others, have so suddenly and so aw∣fully, been taken out of the World <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said, that <HI>more</HI> than an <HI>Hundred</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d the <HI>last Year,</HI> of the <HI>Throat Distemper,</HI> in <HI>this Town.</HI></NOTE>, will prevail with you, in Love and Gratitude to him, and in Kindness to your selves, to im∣prove <HI>this,</HI> and even, all other Means vouch∣safed you, in such a Manner, as shall advance his Praise and Glory, and promote the Weal of your own immortal Souls.</P>
<P><HI>This,</HI> you know is the <HI>third</HI> Time, wherein I have directed my Speech <HI>to you,</HI> in parti∣cular; — The <HI>two former,</HI> chiefly <HI>for your Instruction,</HI> and <HI>this</HI> for your <HI>Quick'ning,</HI> in the Things of God:—Whereby, you may plainly see, how much I bear <HI>you</HI> upon my Mind, and how desirous I am, that you may be accounted to the Lord for a Generation: <HI>to wit,</HI> that you may be a Generation of his Praise, and not a Generation of his Wrath:
<PB N="v" REF="004413_0005_100D4FF9D542AC38"/>
—And O! I beseech you, let not the Words which I have spoken, and which I have written <HI>to you,</HI> be produced against you, in the Day of Judgment, to your Confusion and Condemnation: Hear me now therefore, O ye Children, and depart not from the Words of my Mouth:— I have no greater Joy, than to hear that my Children walk in Truth—.</P>
<P>I shall only add, that the <HI>following</HI> Dis∣course, together with the <HI>two former,</HI> being suitable to your Age, as also, consonant to the Oracles of the ever-living God, I do, there∣fore, recommend <HI>them</HI> to <HI>your</HI> frequent and diligent Perusal; and do solemnly exhort, yea, and charge <HI>you,</HI> to receive and regard the same, not only, as coming from the Mouth of <HI>your Minister;</HI> but also, and especially, as the Word of <HI>your Father in Heaven,</HI> to wit, of <HI>that God,</HI> who has lately formed you, and has shown you great Favour, to whom you were <HI>betimes</HI> devoted; in whom you live, and move, and have your Beings; unto whom you are accountable; and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> alone is able to make <HI>these,</HI> and all othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Means, to be of saving Benefit and Advantage to you —.</P>
<P>To <HI>his</HI> Favour and Blessing I unfeignedly commend <HI>you all;</HI> expecting▪ that both <HI>you,</HI> and <HI>your pious Parents,</HI> will be mindful of <HI>me,</HI> in your Addresses, from Day to Day, to the Throne of Grace—: And assuring <HI>you,</HI> that it is my Heart's Desire, that <HI>you</HI> may

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>UCH is the unparellel'd Love of CHRIST to Souls, that he has shown his kind Regards, not only, to the elder; but also, to the <HI>younger</HI> Sort: Yea, and not only to those, whom we commonly call young Men and Maidens, but also, to such as are in their <HI>Childhood.</HI></P>

<P>Now, the <HI>Lambs</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> are of several Ages; and the <HI>least</HI> or <HI>youngest</HI> of them may not be neglected; but they must be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, as soon as ever they become <HI>capable</HI> of re∣ceiving Instruction. — Ministers are oblig'd to feed them <HI>with Milk,</HI> the sincere Milk of God's Word, as well as the stronger Christians with Meat.</P>
<P>Yea, and our LORD JESUS CHRIST ex∣pecteth, that if <HI>his Ministers</HI> have an un∣feigned <HI>Love</HI> to him, that then, they will do it <HI>voluntarily</HI>; and that their <HI>Love</HI> to him will even <HI>constrain</HI> them to it: as you may see in <HI>John</HI> 21 15. which Pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge of Scripture, I purpose to take further Notice of, by and by.</P>
<P>I have, as you well know, off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd, at one Time and anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, several Discourses to the <HI>young</HI> People of this Place, and at the same Times, have spoken to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Children</HI> among us, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, being consider'd as young Per∣sons.</P>

<P>Not, that I intend to confine my Speech wholly to them; for the young People▪ as

they are call'd; yea, and Persons advanc'd in Years, may here find some Words suita∣ble for them also.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>I crave the Attention of you <HI>all,</HI> but, more especially of the CHILDREN of the Con∣gregation:</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>O that I might be instrumental to lead <HI>you</HI> to the great <HI>Shepherd</HI> of the Flock, the LORD JESUS CHRIST!</P>
<P>In <HI>this Chapter,</HI> we have an Account of CHRIST'S riding in Triumph into <HI>Jerusa∣lem.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Beast</HI> which he rode upon, is said to be, <HI>an Ass, and a Colt the Fole of an Ass.</HI> The Words do <HI>not</HI> intend, that he sat on <HI>both</HI>; sometimes on one, and then on the other, as some have imagin'd: It plainly appears by the other <HI>Evangelists,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark 11. and Luke 19</NOTE> that Christ rode on the <HI>Colt</HI> only. <HI>Matthew</HI> names two for one, by a <HI>Synecdoche</HI>; or, after the familiar Use of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue, he rehearseth one Thing twice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calv.</NOTE>; or, both are mention'd, because the Dam might pro∣bably follow after her Colt <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Non utrique insedit, sed pullo vehebatur, sequente, illius matre. <HI>Liv.</HI></NOTE> — And this was done, that the <HI>Scripture</HI> might be <HI>ful∣filled</HI>; see Zech 9 9. The Beast which
<PB N="4" REF="004413_0008_100D5000A0E0D308"/>
<HI>Christ</HI> improv'd, is called a <HI>Colt</HI>; and is said to be one, <HI>on which never Man sat</HI>▪ Mark 11.2. But notwithstanding, he was fit for Man's Use, and, without Doubt, the Ow∣ner-intended him for speedy Service; for we read, that the Disciples found him <HI>tied</HI>: And it was no unusual Thing, for young Asses to be called Colts, even, <HI>after</HI> they were used for Riding, as may be seen in <HI>Judg.</HI> 10.4 and 12.14. — The Ass being sent for, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, by the Owner's Leave, bro'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for he was borrowed; the <HI>Disciples put on him</HI> some <HI>of their Garments, and</HI> then they <HI>set Jesus thereon</HI>: Which plainly teacheth us, to part with our very <HI>Cloathing</HI> for <HI>Christ</HI>'s Sake, and that freely, when called thereunto; and when we have an Oppor∣tunity to serve him, and advance his Glory, by our so doing.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Christ's Attendants,</HI> they were a <HI>very great Multitude</HI>: — It is true indeed, they were the <HI>meaner</HI> Sort of People, but yet they did him great Honour by <HI>spreading their Garments in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Way, and by cutting down Branches from the Trees, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wing them in the Way</HI>: This, as we are inform∣ed was a Thing <HI>usual</HI> among the <HI>Jews</HI> at the <HI>Feast of Tabernacles,</HI> in Token of Li∣berty, Victory, and Joy: The Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> at <HI>that</HI> Feast, carry'd their Boughs to make Booths of, in Manner of Arbours, wherein to dwell for the Space of <HI>seven</HI> Days; to put them in Mind, of their Fore∣fathers
<PB N="5" REF="004413_0008_100D5000A0E0D308"/>
dwelling in Tents and Tabernacles. (See Levit. 23 39, to the End) Which Bun∣dles they call'd their <HI>Hosanna:</HI> — But then, besides those which they prepar'd to make their Booths of, they also, it seems, provided themselves with Palm Boughs, which they carried <HI>in their Hands,</HI> and as they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, cried <HI>Hosanna:</HI> And in <HI>All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> to this, the People, here, cut down Branches from the Trees, and strewed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem in the Way, when our <HI>Saviour</HI> rode into <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and they cry'd <HI>Hosanna to the Son of David</HI>—v 8▪9.</P>
<P>Being come into <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the whole City was moved: The Acclamations of the Multitude put the People upon looking out of their Houses, and enquiring, <HI>Who is this?</HI> v. 10 To which, the Multitude replyed, <HI>This is Jesus, the Prophet of Nazareth of Ga∣lilee.</HI> v. 11. Thus he was known, and cal∣led among them; and they were free and forward to spread the Knowledge of him where they came, and to speak what they knew concerning him. — The Multitude had, just before, declared him to be the <HI>Son of David,</HI> and proclaimed, that he came in the Name of the Lord, and professed, by their <HI>Hosanna,</HI> that they wish'd well to him, and to his Undertaking; and by their so do∣ing, they plainly sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w'd, that they believ∣ed him to be the <HI>Messiah:</HI> And yet, which one would not have expected, the People of the <HI>City</HI> enquire, Who he is: <HI>That is,</HI> Whence came he? How do you describe
<PB N="6" REF="004413_0009_100D50036F9A2070"/>
him? Have we, or, can you help us to have, any Knowledge of <HI>this</HI> Man? Pray, tell us what you know concerning him In <HI>Answer</HI> to which, some of the Multitude describe him (1) By his Name, <HI>Jesus.</HI> (2) By his Of∣fice, <HI>the Prophet.</HI> (3) By the <HI>Place,</HI> not of his Nativity, but of his <HI>Resilence</HI> at that Time, when his Life was in Danger; of which we have an Account in <HI>Matt.</HI> 2.22, 23.</P>
<P>In the next Place it is to be observed, that <HI>Christ</HI> being entred into <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he went directly to the <HI>Temple</HI>: He, as the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt strait forward to the <HI>Temple</HI> of God, and <HI>purged</HI> it, by casting out all them that sold, and bought, in the Tem∣ple &amp;c. v. 12. And it is undeniable, that he produced sufficient to warrant the doing of what he did; for, he said unto them. <HI>It is written, my House shall be called the House of Prayer</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> 56.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>; <HI>but, ye have made it a Den of Thieves.</HI> v. 13.</P>
<P>And, it may not pass unobserved, that nei∣ther the Honour done him by the Acclama∣tions of the People, nor yet, the Work of purging the Temple, could hinder our bles∣sed <HI>Lord</HI> from showing Pitty to the <HI>Blind</HI> and <HI>Lame; for they came to him in the Tem∣ple, and he healed them.</HI> v 14 Thus, <HI>Christ</HI> embraced <HI>all</HI> Opportunities for the doing of Good; and truly, he was wont to shew him∣self
<PB N="7" REF="004413_0009_100D50036F9A2070"/>
most gracious, even, to those, whom Men are most apt to despise — And, as true it is, that he has <HI>yet</HI> a tender Regard to all those, who, being sensible of their <HI>spi∣ritual</HI> Blindness and Lameness, do cry to him for Healing and Guidance: Yea, and the <HI>House of God</HI> is a very suitable Place, for such to come into, and here to wait on the <HI>Lord</HI> for <HI>saving</HI> Mercy. <HI>Prov</HI> 8.34, 35.</P>
<P>But, that which I shall take a more parti∣cular Notice of, is, the Account which we have of the CHILDREN's <HI>crying in the Tem∣ple, Hosanna to the Son of David</HI> — What bro't those <HI>Children</HI> thither, is uncertain: We know it to be a common Thing for <HI>Children,</HI> to resort to any Place, where they see a Concourse of People, and where there is something new and strange to be seen or heard: "And we would hope, that some of these <HI>Children,</HI> if not all of them, were worshipping at the Temple," at the Time, when <HI>Christ</HI> came thither:— But, let what will be the particular Occasion of their be∣ing conven'd at that Time and Place; yet, this is certain, that the governing <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>God</HI> must be observed in this Matter, <HI>viz.</HI> in inclining them, not only, to repair thi∣ther at that Juncture, but also, to <HI>unite, in crying Hosanna to the Son of David</HI>; that is, to the promised M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssiah, whom all M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n ac∣knowledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, should be the Son of <HI>David,</HI> ac∣cording to the <HI>Flesh</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004413_0010_100D500515E7DD48"/>They cry'd <HI>Hosanna</HI>; which Word signi∣fieth, <HI>Save,</HI> and is a Petition for Salvation: And may be look'd upon, <HI>first,</HI> 'As a <HI>Pray∣er</HI> to the FATHER." to save his Son, and prosper him in his Undertaking: Also, it carries in it <HI>Gratitude</HI> and <HI>Thankfulness</HI> to <HI>him,</HI> for making such Provision for the Sal∣vation of poor, lost Man. — And <HI>secondly,</HI> "It may be consider'd as a <HI>Prayer</HI> to the LORD JESUS CHRIST," the Son of God him∣self, to become <HI>their</HI> Saviour: As also, a Note and Evidence of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Praise,</HI> that <HI>he</HI> was pleased to condescend, to take upon him the <HI>Office</HI> of <HI>a Saviour</HI>—.</P>
<P>In a Word;</P>
<P>The Term <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sannah</HI> is an Expression both of PRAYER and PRAISE: A welcoming Christ's Kingdom, and a wishing well unto it: And it very plainly refers to a <HI>Part</HI> of the 118th <HI>Psalm</HI>: In which <HI>Psalm</HI> our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> is very clearly pointed un∣to; for, we have his State of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>miliation</HI> and <HI>Exaltation</HI> both prophesy'd of, in v. 22. Which is styled the <HI>marvelous</HI> Work of <HI>God</HI> in v. 23. Then, in the next Verse, it is said, <HI>This is the Day, which the Lord hath made, we will rejoyce and be glad in it</HI>: Which Words may point to the Time of the <HI>Gospel</HI> Dispensation in general; but more particular∣ly; either, to <HI>the Day</HI> spoken of in our <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Context,</HI> on which Christ rode <HI>in Triumph</HI> into <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which was but little before his Passion, and was without Doubt, a <HI>Specimen</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="004413_0010_100D500515E7DD48"/>
of that Conquest, which he should obtain over his Enemies; and of that Power and Glory, which he should be exalted unto: Or else, it may especially point out to us, the Day of the <HI>Christian Sabbath,</HI> which is the Day of our Saviour's <HI>Resurrection</HI> from the Dead — I say, tho' the Words may look forward to <HI>all</HI> that I have now menti∣on'd, yet, this latter, <HI>viz</HI> the <HI>Christian Sab∣bath,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, most probably, <HI>especially</HI> intended: For, when he arose from the Dead, then, he <HI>actually</HI> triumph'd over Death, Hell, and the Grave, and led Captivity captive; of which, as was before observed, his <HI>Riding</HI> in <HI>Triumph</HI> into <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was a <HI>Specimen.</HI>— Then it follows in v. 25 <HI>Hosannah,</HI> as may be seen in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> which is rendred in our T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slation, <HI>Save: Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord▪ O Lord, I beseech thee, send now Prosperity.</HI> As tho' they had said, Al∣tho' others despise thee; yet, <HI>Lord, we</HI> wish thee Prosperity; and notwithstanding, o∣thers refuse to yield Subjection to thee; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>we</HI> profess ourselves thy loyal Subjects, and faithful Servants.—It is added in v. 26 <HI>Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</HI> Agreable to which, is that in the 9th ver. of our <HI>Context:</HI> As tho' they had said, Seeing thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mest in the Name of the Lord, and art sent by the <HI>Father,</HI> from Heaven, upon this great and important Errand, and art ordained by him, to be our Lord and Saviour; <HI>we</HI> do, with all Thankfulness, accept of

thee; and will with all Readiness submit unto thee—.</P>
<P>So that, you see, our <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Context</HI> plainly refer to <HI>some Verses</HI> in the 118th <HI>Psalm</HI>; and is, <HI>in Part,</HI> the ACCOMPLISH∣MENT of that <HI>glorious Prophecy</HI>—.</P>
<P>But to proceed;</P>
<P>The Chief Priests and Scribes taking No∣tice of the wonderful Things, which <HI>Christ</HI> did; and of the <HI>Words,</HI> which were spoken by the <HI>Children, viz. Hosanna to the Son of David</HI>; It is said, <HI>they were sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> displeased.</HI> v. 15.—But, how did they discover their Resentment? Not by saulting him for the Cures, which he wro't on the Blind, and Lame; No, for then, all the People would have cry'd out <HI>Shame upon 'em:</HI> But, they blam'd the <HI>Children,</HI> or rather <HI>Christ,</HI> for suffering the <HI>Children,</HI> to do him as great Honour, as tho' he was a <HI>God</HI>; Or else, for allowing them to meddle with that, which, as they supposed, those <HI>Children</HI> did not un∣derstand; and therefore, as they imagin'd, took the Name of the Lord their God in vain — <HI>Hearest thou what they say?</HI> That is, Dost thou take Notice of it or not? If not, they spend their Breath in vain: And if thou dost hear and observe, then, why are they allowed to go on?— Whereunto, <HI>Jesus</HI> replyed, <HI>Have ye never read, out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings thou hast per∣fected
<PB N="11" REF="004413_0011_100D500765570D30"/>
Praise</HI>; Or, <HI>ordained Strength</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 8.2.</NOTE>: For, "it is to the Praise of God's Strength; yea, his Praise is <HI>perfected,</HI> when he inclines and enables such <HI>weak</HI> Instruments to show forth his Praises."</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Christ</HI> answered the chief Priests and Scribes; and it was sufficient to <HI>still those E∣nemies of his,</HI> who would gladly, if they dar'd, have <HI>aveng'd</HI> themselves on him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Same Verse.</NOTE>:— We don't read of <HI>any Reply,</HI> that they made to <HI>Christ</HI>: Whether is was, because they were convicted in their own Consciences, that they were in the wrong; or, whether, because they had not the Opportunity for it; is uncertain: But this is certain, that <HI>Christ</HI> quickly left them, and went out of the City into <HI>Bethany,</HI> and lodged there, which was about <HI>two</HI> Miles distant from <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; for they had forfeited the Favour of his Presence.</P>
<P>It is very evident, from <HI>Christ</HI>'s not com∣manding the <HI>Children</HI> to forbear; and from his making such a Reply as he did, to the chief Priests and Scribes; that he allowed of, yea, that he was <HI>pleased</HI> with, the <HI>Children's Hosannas. Christ</HI> could easily have check'd them: Yea, and truly they would not have proceeded, had they so much as dis∣cerned, that it was in any Measure, disagre∣able to <HI>Christ,</HI> that <HI>they</HI> should <HI>thus</HI> express themselves: But, <HI>Christ</HI> did not discover
<PB N="12" REF="004413_0012_100D50094CDC5008"/>
any such Thing; No, but the Contrary▪ ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, that <HI>he</HI> allowed and <HI>approved</HI> of wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>they</HI> did.</P>
<P>So that, we may <HI>observe</HI> from hence, thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plain Truth, for our</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE,</HEAD>
<P>That our LORD JESUS CHRI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>T not only ob∣serves, but also, is <HI>well ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed,</HI> and <HI>highly gratified,</HI> with the PRAYERS, and PRAISES of CHILDREN</P>
<P>The Term <HI>HOSANNA</HI> carries in it the Voice of PRAYER and PRAISE, as was before noted.</P>
<P>And</P>
<P>That CHRIST <HI>observes all such,</HI> who are <HI>thus</HI> employed, is undeniable: Nothing 'scapes <HI>his</HI> Notice: <HI>He has Eyes as a Flame of Fire: His Eyes run to and fro thro' out the whole Earth▪ to show himself strong in the Behalf of them, whose H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art is perfect towards him</HI> 2 Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n 16.9. He is <HI>God</HI> as well as Man; and none can hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e themselves in se∣cret Places, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should not see th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. Him hath the <HI>Fath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> ordained to be the <HI>Judge</HI> of the World; and in order to his passing a just Sentence, and rendering to e∣very one according to his Ways, it is very necessary, that he <HI>observe</HI> what their Ways are, whether good or bad: And, not only the Ways of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lder People, but also, of <HI>Chil∣dren,</HI> fall under his Observation; for, <HI>these
<PB N="13" REF="004413_0012_100D50094CDC5008"/>
latter,</HI> as well as the former, must come into Judgment. Rev. 20 12 <HI>And I saw the Dead, Small and Great, stand before God, and the Books were opened:— And the Dead were judged out of these Things, which were written in the Books, according to their Works.</HI></P>
<P>But then, <HI>Christ</HI> not only observes, but, is <HI>well pleased</HI> with the Voice of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI></P>
<P>It is <HI>pleasing</HI> to him, when Persons, <HI>whe∣ther elder or younger,</HI> do, either in the Way of <HI>Prayer,</HI> or of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nging Psalms, Praise him,</HI> for the many Mercies b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stowed by him, on themselves and others: And, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n especial Manner, when they <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aise him</HI> for his <HI>great Love,</HI> in coming into the World, and giving himself for poor Sinners; and for m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king known himself to them, and the Way to Life thro' him; and for his striving with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m by his <HI>Spirit,</HI> and waiting to be gracious to them — In a Word; It is <HI>pleasing</HI> to <HI>Christ</HI> to be <HI>praised,</HI> for what he is in him∣self, and for what he has done and suffer'd, and is still doing for fallen Man; and, even, for all that Good, which we have in Hand, and which we have i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hope.— And in∣deed, he ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <HI>justly expects it,</HI> inasmuch as, he is <HI>both</HI> the Purchaser and Disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nser of <HI>all</HI> our Favours Of him, and thro' him, are all Things, and therefore, <HI>to</HI> him, not exclud∣ing the Father and the Holy Ghost, should be <HI>Glory</HI> for ever; <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004413_0013_100D2FE7D05B87D0"/>And, as it is <HI>pleasing</HI> to <HI>Christ,</HI> that People show forth his Praises; so also, that they <HI>make their Requests to him,</HI> for themselves and others; and for the Advancement of his Kingdom, and the Overthrow of Satan's, thro' the World: It <HI>pleaseth him well,</HI> when Persons pray for <HI>spiritual</HI> Blessings with <HI>Fer∣vency</HI> and Importunity; and for <HI>Temporal,</HI> with an entire <HI>Submission</HI> to the sovereign Will and Pleasure of God; and when they offer up their Requests to the Father, <HI>in his Name</HI>; that is, by Faith in his Satisfaction and Intercession; which is not, in the least, inconsistent with making their Prayers to <HI>Christ himself</HI>; for, we must bear in Mind, that the <HI>Three</HI> Persons in the Godhead are <HI>but one</HI> God: If, in our Worship, we should consider each Person as a <HI>seperate</HI> God, then we should worship, in a Manner, three Gods instead of One: So that, we must take great Care, to adore One in Three, and Three in One, and to give <HI>equal</HI> Honour to each Person. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot think upon <HI>One,</HI> but, by and by, I am compass'd about with the Brightness of <HI>Three</HI>; and I cannot distinguish <HI>Three,</HI> but I am sudden∣ly driven back unto <HI>One</HI>; said <HI>Nazianzen.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>But then, let it be remark'd, that <HI>Christ</HI> does not take <HI>Delight</HI> in the Prayers and Praises of any, but of those, who <HI>so</HI> regard him, <HI>as to sit at his Feet, and hear his Word</HI>;
<PB N="15" REF="004413_0013_100D2FE7D05B87D0"/>
and that, with a Desire and Purpose, to know, and do, their Duty, respecting God, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Neighbour, and themselves.— This, I say, is <HI>very pleasing</HI> to <HI>Christ,</HI> when Persons daily read and consult his holy Word, and diligently attend to the same when preached, and lay it up in their Hearts, in order to bring forth the Fruit of it in their Lives.—</P>
<P>And, in a Word;</P>
<P><HI>Christ</HI> is <HI>pleased,</HI> when People worship him in <HI>publick,</HI> according to his Appoint∣ment; and, when they have their <HI>private</HI> Meetings, to worship the Lord, and to edifie one another; and, when they join in <HI>Family</HI> Devotions; each Family apart offering up, daily, the Morning and Evening Sacrifice of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI>; and finally, when <HI>each Person</HI> makes Conscience of observing and attending the Religion of the <HI>Closet,</HI> and takes Care to order his <HI>whole</HI> Conversation <HI>aright</HI>; and especially when <HI>little Children</HI> do so.</P>
<P>And I may venture to say, that <HI>all such,</HI> Old and Young, as are <HI>sincere</HI> in these their Ser∣vices, will <HI>actually</HI> promote the Interest of <HI>Christ</HI> all they can; <HI>exciting</HI> and <HI>encourag∣ing</HI> those wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m they converse with, to the Duties of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise:</HI> Yea, and truly, they will seek to <HI>propagate</HI> the true Religion among such, as are ignorant of it; or those, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o are not able, of themselves, to support the Charge of it. Endeavours, I say, will be joined with sincere and humble

Prayers, according to Persons Ability and Opportunity; and <HI>This will be an Odour of a sweet Smell; a Sacrifice, acceptable, and well pleasing to God, thro' Jesus Christ</HI>—.</P>
<P>But my <HI>Text</HI> leads me to speak of <HI>Children only,</HI> and therefore, for the <HI>further</HI> clearing of the Doctrine, I shall endeavour to speak to <HI>two</HI> Things, briefly: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. To show, that <HI>it is a Truth,</HI> that <HI>Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well pleased</HI> with the <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Praises</HI> of <HI>Children.</HI> And then,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. To give you the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the Doc∣trine.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Here then,</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to evince the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Doc∣trine; Or, to show, that <HI>Christ</HI> is certainly <HI>well pleased,</HI> and <HI>highly gratified,</HI> with the <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Praises</HI> of <HI>Children.</HI>— And truly,</P>
<P>This is very evident from our <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Context</HI>; for, we find <HI>here,</HI> that <HI>Christ,</HI> not only, <HI>tolerated</HI> the <HI>Children</HI>'s crying in the Temple, <HI>Hosanna to the Son of David</HI>; but moreover, <HI>he vindicated them,</HI> altho' the chief Priests and Scribes would have had him re∣buked 'em; which plainly argues, that what the <HI>Children</HI> said, was <HI>pleasing to him, Hosanna to the Son of David,</HI> or the Exerci∣ses of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise,</HI> well <HI>become</HI> the Mouths of <HI>Children</HI>▪ otherwise, the <HI>Lord
<PB N="17" REF="004413_0014_100D500E81FC8F68"/>
Jesus</HI> would, doubtless, have put a Stop to their Proceeding; but on the other Hand, he <HI>encourag'd them</HI> in it, and <HI>stop'd</HI> the <HI>Mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s</HI> of <HI>Gainsayers</HI>—.</P>
<P>But, the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Doctrine will yet <HI>more</HI> clearly appear, by considering these few Things following, <HI>viz</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It is the express <HI>Commandment</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> that Persons <HI>seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness.</HI> Matt. 6 33. <HI>Seek first</HI>; that is, not only first in Affection, and above all other Things; but also, <HI>first in Time,</HI> and <HI>before</HI> all other Things. And in Eccles. 12.1· it is written, <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth.</HI>—You may not ima∣gine, that Persons are hereby excused, from remembring the Lord in their <HI>Childhood</HI>; No verily; but, the Words may be consi∣der'd, as related, or connected, to those immediately preceeding, which are, <HI>Child∣hood and Youth are Vanity:</HI> So that, the Meaning is this, do not, like many others, who spend their <HI>Childhood</HI> and <HI>Youth</HI> in Va∣nity; but, in your <HI>early</HI> Days, remember your Creator, even, as soon as you are capa∣ble, and have the Exercise of Reason.— <HI>Children!</HI> here's a Remedy prescrib'd to cure you of your Vanity, and that is, remember <HI>now</HI> thy Creator: And it is the Command∣ment and Expectation of the great GOD, who has lately form'd and fashion'd <HI>you,</HI> that <HI>you</HI> apply and improve this Remedy. Indeed, if you can make it appear, that the
<PB N="18" REF="004413_0015_100D50111A86DCF0"/>
Lord is <HI>not your</HI> Creator, then, <HI>you are</HI> ex∣cused from remembring and obeying him; but otherwise, <HI>you</HI> are <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I may argue further, for the <HI>Proof</HI> of the Doctrine, <HI>viz</HI> from the Consideration, that <HI>Christ</HI> has <HI>ordered,</HI> that <HI>little Children be allowed to come to him,</HI> and <HI>that they be not forbidden</HI>—.</P>
<P>This is plainly set forth before us, in Matt. 19.13, 14, 15.— Those Persons, who bro't these <HI>Children,</HI> shew'd their Love to, and Faith in, <HI>Christ,</HI> but the Disciples rebuked them; probably, thinking it to be <HI>below</HI> their Master, to regard <HI>Children</HI>; or else, that he had Work enough besides: But, for what Reason soever they did it, yet <HI>Christ</HI> was <HI>displeased</HI> with them for it, and said, <HI>Suffer little Children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> Yea, and he actually <HI>laid his Hands on them,</HI> in token of his <HI>blessing them</HI>: "And thus, our Lord asserted the Rights of the <HI>Lambs</HI> of his Flock: To them be∣long the Privileges of visible Church-Mem∣bership, as among the <HI>Jews</HI> of old;" for, says our <HI>Saviour, of such is the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> They are Members of the visible Church, being Children of believing Pa∣rents: Now, the <HI>Promise</HI> is to such <HI>Pa∣rents,</HI> and to their <HI>Children.</HI> Acts 2.39.—It is very plain, that these <HI>Children,</HI> who were bro't to <HI>Christ,</HI> were <HI>small</HI>; even, so little, as to be bro't in the Arms; probably, they
<PB N="19" REF="004413_0015_100D50111A86DCF0"/>
were a Year or two old, or less: And it is as plain, that they were <HI>very welcome</HI> to <HI>Christ.</HI>— Which by the Way, affords a ve∣ry weighty Argument for <HI>Infant Baptism</HI>: — But, not to insist upon that at present, but to come to what I intend; I may argue thus,</P>
<P>If <HI>Christ welcom'd little Children,</HI> when they were <HI>bro't</HI> to him <HI>by others</HI>; doubtless, it is <HI>pleasing to him,</HI> when <HI>Children come</HI> to him <HI>themselves</HI> and do <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>volunta∣rily</HI> join in the Exercises of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise,</HI> giving to him the glory due to his Name, and waiting upon him for his Bles∣sing: If the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> will <HI>accept</HI> of <HI>Chil¦dren,</HI> when offered and dedicated by their <HI>Parents</HI>; without Question, he will accept of them, when <HI>they present themselves,</HI> an Offering unto the Lord Pious Parents de∣vote their <HI>Children</HI> to the Lord, <HI>desiring,</HI> that they may be his; but when the <HI>Children</HI> present <HI>themselves,</HI> it is supposed that they are <HI>determined</HI> to be his. In the <HI>parental</HI> Dedi∣cation, <HI>Children</HI> are meerly <HI>passive,</HI> but in the <HI>Self</HI>-Dedication, they are <HI>active</HI>; and we would hope, <HI>sincere</HI> too, in Obedience to that Command, which is written in Prov. 23 26 MY SON, GIVE ME THINE HEART.</P>
<P N="3">3. I might also mention, by Way of Ar∣gument, the <HI>Pleas,</HI> which <HI>Christ</HI> hath been pleased to put into the <HI>Mouths</HI> of <HI>Children.</HI> — I shall just hint at one or two of them.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004413_0016_100D5012A41A08F0"/>Thus, they have their <HI>Baptism</HI> to plead with <HI>Christ,</HI> for his Acceptance of them: This Ordinance is administred to the <HI>Infants</HI> of believing Parents; and is done, as we conceive, by the Order and Appointment of our <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour</HI>: And it both lays Persons under Engagements to be his Ser∣vants, and gives <HI>them Ground</HI> to hope for, and expect, his Acceptance and Blessing, when <HI>they</HI> make it their great <HI>Care</HI> to <HI>fulfill</HI> those Engagements.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>they</HI> have a <HI>special</HI> Word of <HI>Promise</HI> put into their Mouths, to plead with <HI>Christ.</HI> Such as that, in Prov. 8.17. <HI>They that seek me</HI> EARLY, <HI>shall find me.</HI> And that, in Isa. 45.19. <HI>I said not unto the</HI> SEED <HI>of Jacob, seek ye me in vain</HI> And many other that might be named.—</P>
<P>Now, I say, <HI>Christ</HI> having furnished <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> with <HI>such Pleas,</HI> it argues, that it is <HI>pleasing</HI> to him, when they improve them in the Ways of divine Appointment; and par∣ticularly, in the Duty of <HI>Prayer</HI>—.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Truth</HI> of the Doctrine is further evident, from the Consideration, that <HI>Christ</HI> has <HI>commanded</HI> his <HI>Ministers</HI> to feed his <HI>Lambs:</HI></P>
<P>This may be seen, in <HI>John</HI> 21.15. Which Words were directed, not to <HI>Peter only,</HI> but, do also concern <HI>all</HI> those, who serve in the Work and Business of the Ministry. — And truly, not only Ministers, but also <HI>Parents,</HI> and even <HI>all</HI> who have the
<PB N="21" REF="004413_0016_100D5012A41A08F0"/>
<HI>Care</HI> of <HI>Children,</HI> are obliged to train them up in the Way they should go; and to bring them up in the Nurture and Admoni∣tion of the Lord.— Now, doubtless, these Things argue, that <HI>Christ</HI> is <HI>pleased,</HI> when <HI>Children</HI> engage in religious Exercises <HI>them∣selvos.</HI> — The <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> would have <HI>Children</HI> instructed by his Ministers, and by their Parents, and others, who have them under their Watch, for <HI>this very End, viz.</HI> that they may be led, <HI>actually,</HI> to en∣gage in his Service themselves. He would have them to know their Duty, in order to do it: And <HI>the sooner</HI> they understand, de∣light in, and practise their Duty, <HI>the more</HI> do they <HI>please</HI> and <HI>gratify</HI> the <HI>Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 It is agreable to <HI>Scripture Prophecies</HI> and <HI>Promises,</HI> that <HI>Children</HI> should bring Praise to the Name of God, by <HI>their Devo∣tions.</HI></P>
<P>See for this Purpose, that fore-cited Psal. 8.2. <HI>Out of the Mouth of Babes and Suck∣lings, hast thou ordained Strength</HI>; or, <HI>per∣fected Praise,</HI> as in our Context. And agre∣able hereto, is that in Isa 44 3, 4, 5 <HI>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Blessing upon thine Offspring, and they shall spring up as among the Grass, as Willows by the Water-Courses; One shall say, I am the Lord's; and another shall call himself by the Name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his Hand unto the Lord, and sirname himself by the Name of Israel.</HI> — Now I say,
<PB N="22" REF="004413_0017_100D5014C99913B8"/>
it is abundantly evident, from such like Promises and Prophecies, that the <HI>Devotions</HI> of <HI>Children</HI> are <HI>pleasing</HI> to <HI>Christ</HI> He is <HI>greatly delighted,</HI> when the holy Scriptures are fulfilled, especially, the <HI>promissory</HI> Part, or, that which brings Glory to his Name, and, at the same Time, holds forth Grace and Favour to the Children of Men.</P>
<P N="6">6 It also appears from <HI>Christ's inclining</HI> and <HI>disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing some Children</HI> to <HI>religious</HI> Exer∣cises, that, <HI>he is pleased,</HI> when <HI>they</HI> are <HI>so</HI> engaged.</P>
<P>To illustrate this, consider briefly,</P>
<P>It is a very common Thing for <HI>Children</HI> to delight in <HI>Play</HI>; and it is very natural for them to <HI>Sin,</HI> they even incline to it, as the Sparks to fly upwards: From hence it fol∣lows, that they are naturally <HI>averse</HI> to the religious Exercises of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI>: They are corrupt, each one, for that which is born of the Flesh is Flesh; and the car∣nal Mind is Enmity against God. — So then, we may conclude, that whenever <HI>Children</HI> do freely and voluntarily engage in <HI>religious</HI> Exercises, that it is CHRIST, who, by the Operations of the <HI>Holy Ghost, inclines</HI> them thereunto. — Alass! How many <HI>Children</HI> are there, who are well instructed, and yet, don't incline to seek and serve the <HI>Lord!</HI> May we not then look upon it, as the Work of the <HI>Lord,</HI> when <HI>some</HI> are <HI>thus</HI> inclined; and especially, if <HI>they continue</HI> in
<PB N="23" REF="004413_0017_100D5014C99913B8"/>
the Way of Well-doing? Doubtless, we may▪ and we ought, to account it to be the <HI>Doing</HI> of the <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now I say, if it is <HI>Christ,</HI> who by his <HI>Spirit, inclines Children</HI> to <HI>religious</HI> Exercises, then, without Question, he is <HI>pleased</HI> with <HI>their Devotions:</HI> For, he would have all, old and young, to <HI>regard</HI> the Motions and Strivings of the Holy <HI>Spirit.</HI> Hence it is said in 1 Thes. 5.19 <HI>Quench not the Spirit.</HI> And in Eph. 4 30 <HI>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</HI> And agreable to this, we find, that it is ve∣ry offensive to God, when Persons are <HI>so stiff-necked,</HI> as <HI>to resist the Holy Ghost.</HI> Acts. 7.15.</P>
<P>I shall only add,</P>
<P N="7">7. and lastly. As the <HI>first ripe</HI> Fruits are, ordinarily, of greatest Account among Men, even so, <HI>early</HI> Religion is most highly pleas∣ing unto the blessed <HI>Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>We find that it was an Ordinance of old, Exod 22 29 <HI>Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe Fruits</HI>—: Which teaches us, that <HI>little Children</HI> may <HI>not delay</HI> to offer unto God, the <HI>first Fruits</HI> of their <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> for with <HI>such</HI> Sacrifices <HI>God</HI> is <HI>well pleased,</HI> yea, the Lord accepts them with a sweet Savour. — We read also in Gen. 4.4. <HI>That Abel brought of the Firstlings of his Flock, and of the Fat thereof</HI>—: Which teaches us, that it is a good Thing for <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> to be well taught, and train'd up <HI>be∣times</HI> in <HI>religious</HI> Services (as Abel was) that so, when they come to be capable of acting
<PB N="24" REF="004413_0018_100D50167A73AF20"/>
for themselves, they may, of their own Ac∣cord (as Abel did) bring an Offering to the Lord: Yea, "and he was <HI>curious</HI> in the Choice of his Offering, for he bro't not the Lame, or the Lean, or the Refuse, but the <HI>Firstlings</HI> of the Flock, the <HI>best</HI> he had, and the <HI>Fat</HI> thereof; that is, the <HI>best</HI> of those best." From whence we learn, that <HI>he</HI> who is the <HI>First</HI> and best, should have the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>best</HI> of our <HI>Time, Strength,</HI> and <HI>Service</HI>—: Well, but how did <HI>Abel succeed</HI> in his Devo∣tions? Truly very well; for it is added, that <HI>the Lord had Respect unto Abel, and to his Offering.</HI>— And indeed, it holds true to this very Day, <HI>viz</HI> That all such who sin∣cerely offer the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>best</HI> of what they <HI>have,</HI> and <HI>can do,</HI> unto the Lord <HI>Jesus,</HI> they shall be <HI>accepted</HI> of him, which is the Thing principally to be aim'd at in <HI>all</HI> Acts of Re∣ligion: Yea, he hath a <HI>special Delight</HI> in all such <HI>little Ones,</HI> who truly fear and serve him: Not only is there Joy in the Presence of the <HI>Angels</HI> of God over such, but the <HI>Lord of Glory himself takes Pleasure</HI> in them, and <HI>his Delights</HI> are with <HI>these</HI> Sons and Daugh∣ters of Men.</P>
<P>Yea, I may go on to say, <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se</HI> are they whom the <HI>King</HI> of Glory <HI>delights</HI> to <HI>put Honour upon:</HI> And agreably, we find that such as were, of old Time, Serious and Pious in their <HI>early</HI> Days, their <HI>Names</HI> are left up∣on Record, in the Oracles of God, for this End, that so, they may be transmitted, with
<PB N="25" REF="004413_0018_100D50167A73AF20"/>
a fragrant Smell and a sweet Savour, to the latest Posterity; for the <HI>King's Favour</HI> is to∣wards such <HI>wise Children.</HI>— But then, this is not all, no, but furthermore, such as are religious <HI>betimes</HI> commonly prove the most <HI>eminent Saints,</HI> yea, and moreover, God of∣tentimes improves them in the most <HI>eminent</HI> and <HI>honourable</HI> Services, in their Day and Generation:— Thus, to mention a few Instances—; <HI>Joseph,</HI> a <HI>well disposed Child,</HI> and a <HI>godly young Man,</HI> was, thro' Grace, even, in that Age of Life, <HI>Strong, and over∣came the wicked One</HI>: And did God disre∣gard him? No indeed, but he was greatly advanced, highly exalted; for, <HI>After the Word of the Lord had tried him, the King sent and loosed him; even the Ruler of the People, and let him go free: He made him Lord of his House, and Ruler of all his Sub∣stance: To bind his Princes at his Pleasure, and teach his Senators Wisdom.</HI> — Also <HI>Job</HI> was well disposed, and well employed <HI>betimes,</HI> for he began very <HI>early</HI> to <HI>do Good,</HI> (Job. 31.18.) and this Man prov'd an <HI>emi∣nent Saint,</HI> yea. he excell'd all that lived in his Day; there's <HI>none like him,</HI> says <HI>God, in the Earth</HI>: Well, and did not the Most-High confer still <HI>more Honour</HI> upon him? Yes indeed, for, even, in his <HI>Youth,</HI> the <HI>Candle of God shined on his Head</HI>; yea, and he had sweet Communion with God, for <HI>the Secret of the Lord was with him</HI> (Job. 29, 3, 4.) moreover, he abounded in <HI>Wealth,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="004413_0019_100D501964E28140"/>
and was promoted to great <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Pow∣er</HI> in his Country, and had Respect paid him by all sorts of People, in token of the Sense they were under, of their Obligations to him, for the many good Services which he did, from Day to Day. Chap. 29 — Also <HI>David</HI> was vertuous and pious, even, from his <HI>Childhood,</HI> and theref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e▪ said, as in Psalm. 71.5. and 17. <HI>Thou art my Hope, O Lord God; Thou art my Trust from my Youth. O God, thou hast taught me from my Youth; and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous Works.</HI> Neither was the Most High unmindful of him in the following Scenes of his Life; nay, but he had very great <HI>Honour</HI> confer'd upon him being both a <HI>Prophet,</HI> and a <HI>King,</HI> in <HI>Israel</HI>; for, them that honour God, he will honour; But, that which redounds most of all to the Honour of King <HI>David,</HI> is this, that <HI>from him.</HI> as concerning the Flesh, <HI>Christ came</HI>; and therefore, our <HI>Saviour</HI> is styled, in our Text, <HI>the Son of David</HI> What greater Honour can be done to <HI>David,</HI> than this, that the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God</HI> should be called the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>Da∣vid</HI>? This will be to his <HI>everlasting Honour.</HI> — And then, as to <HI>Obaliah</HI>; as he feared the Lord from his Youth, so, he became ve∣ry <HI>eminent</HI> in his Day; and that in <HI>sundry</HI> Respects; <HI>viz.</HI> as a <HI>Saint,</HI> for <HI>he feared the Lord greatly</HI> 1 King 18 3. and 12. And he was <HI>highly advanced,</HI> for he was a great Man at Court, and Steward of the King's

Houshold. And finally, the good <HI>Service</HI> which he did in the Cause of the <HI>true Religi∣on</HI> rendred him very eminent; for, he im∣prov'd his Wealth and Power, for the Protec∣tion and Support of the <HI>Lord's Prophets,</HI> and that with a View to their being S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rviceable hereafter, tho' now they were laid aside— And I shall further add, that as to <HI>Josi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> we read, that <HI>while he was yet young, he be∣gan to seek after the God of David his Father.</HI> 2 Chron. 34.3 And the Lord bestowed great <HI>Honour</HI> upon him, for he was not on∣ly <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> but also, very <HI>zealous</HI> for his God, yea, a <HI>None such</HI> for Sincerity and Zeal in carrying on a Work of Refor∣mation, for it is said, that there was <HI>none like him.</HI> And as he had the Honour to live greatly desired so also, to die much la∣mented.— But why do I spend Time in multiplying Instances? — Let <HI>One</HI> suf∣fice to be mentioned out of the <HI>New-Testa∣ment, viz. Timothy</HI>; concerning whom it is written, 2 Tim. 3 15. <HI>From a Child,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, from a <HI>little</HI> Child, yea, from an <HI>Infant,</HI> as the Word properly signifieth.

No, for he

put so great Honour upon him, as to employ him, as <HI>his Ambassador,</HI> to <HI>evangelize</HI> the Nations: Yea, and he had the Honour to glorify God, by dying a <HI>Martyr,</HI> in the Cause of that holy Religion, which he had preached a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d propagated.</P>
<P>And now upon the whole, when we con∣sider, how <HI>acceptable</HI> to God, the Offerings of well disposed Children be; and how he has been wont to <HI>honour such,</HI> from Time to Time, in the Course of their Lives, who were <HI>early</HI> devoted to his Fear and Service; does it not from hence plainly appear, that <HI>early</HI> Religion is <HI>most highly pleasing, and in∣finitely delghtful, to him</HI>?</P>
<P>Behold, as we commonly set most by those Trees in the <HI>Orchard,</HI> which prove fruitful <HI>betimes,</HI> and whose Fruit is pleasant both to the Eye and Tast; even so, the great Lord of the Vineyard is most highly grati∣fied with such Persons, who, in their <HI>early</HI> Days, conform to the Dictates of Wisdom, and with whom are <HI>betimes</HI>▪ found some good Things towards the <HI>Lord God</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> —</P>
<P>A little to illustrate this Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, I shall make use of the most familiar and easy Terms I can; Thus suppose that there be a few <HI>Children</HI> in the <HI>Parish</HI>; (some being <HI>four,</HI> some <HI>six,</HI> some <HI>eight,</HI> others <HI>ten,</HI> and others <HI>twelve</HI> Years of Age) who daily, and of their own Accord, read in the holy <HI>Bible,</HI> learn their <HI>Catechism,</HI> and enquire into the <HI>Meaning</HI> of the same; also retire daily, both Morning
<PB N="29" REF="004413_0020_100D501BC9E7F708"/>
and Evening, for <HI>secret</HI> Devotion; and who, in their Conversation, plainly d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scover an Abhorrence of every evil and false Way, an Awe of the Almighty, and a Love to him, and to his Sabbaths, his Ordinances, and People; and who behave dutifully towards their Parents and other Superiors, and ob∣ligingly towards their Inferiors and Equals. — What think you concerning such <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> as these? Will not our <HI>Lord Redeemer</HI> look upon them with a great deal of Plea∣sure and Satisfaction? Yes verily, he has a peculiar Kindness for <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>We read in the Gospel (Mark 10 17 and on) concerning a young Man, who had pre∣serv'd his Youth unblemish'd, and had an Inclination to know, what was further in∣cumbent on him, in order to his obtaining eternal Life:— It is said, that <HI>Jesus be∣holding him loved him</HI>; he look'd upon him with a <HI>pleasant</HI> Countenance; which plain∣ly teaches us, that our great <HI>Saviour</HI> dearly loves to behold <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Youth</HI> behave inoffensively, and to see and hear them in∣quisitive how to live better, asking the Way to Heaven with their Faces thither∣w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd.— Go <HI>you</HI> therefore, and do like∣wise.</P>
<P>Children, if you have any Ingenuity in you, you will be very desirous to do such Things, as are pleasing to your pious Pa∣rents: But, O! How much more sollici∣tou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should you be, to please and gratifie
<PB N="30" REF="004413_0021_100D501DF74421E0"/>
him, who is both <HI>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur</HI> and <HI>their</HI> LORD and SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>What you have heard, may suffice to show, that <HI>Christ</HI> is <HI>well pleased</HI> with the <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Praises</HI> of <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore I shall proceed to the <HI>Second</HI> Thing mentiond. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. To give you the <HI>Reasons, why Christ</HI> is pleased and gratified with the Prayers and Praises of <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P>Which I shall little more than mention; <HI>namely,</HI> Because it is <HI>eminently</HI> for the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and for the <HI>Children's Good,</HI> that <HI>they</HI> be <HI>thus</HI> employed I say,</P>
<P>It will redound to the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> when <HI>Children</HI> are found to be <HI>thus inclined</HI> and disposed; for it will be readily acknowledged by People, to be the <HI>Doing</HI> of the <HI>Lord,</HI> as was before hinted; and will appear <HI>wondrous</HI> in <HI>their Eyes:</HI> It will cause <HI>Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Religion,</HI> to be taken the <HI>greater</HI> Notice of by Men of <HI>Fi∣gure</HI>; and even, by all, who are <HI>more i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Years:</HI> Yea, and it has a great Tendency to <HI>put them to Shame,</HI> for <HI>their</HI> Neglect, and to excite <HI>them</HI> to redeem Time; which if they are bro't to do, it will be <HI>much</HI> to the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> as well as for their own Interest.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>well disposed Children</HI> are <HI>most likely</HI> to <HI>continue</HI> in the Service of God, and to <HI>abound</HI> in well-doing; which if they
<PB N="31" REF="004413_0021_100D501DF74421E0"/>
do, they'll <HI>greatly honour Christ,</HI> as also, lay up in Store <HI>for themselves</HI> against the Time to come. Now, I say, Persons are <HI>most likely</HI> to <HI>abide</HI> in <HI>that</HI> Service, which they <HI>early</HI> engage in. Agreably we read, in Prov. 22.6. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain up a Child in the Way he should go and when he is old, he will not depa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from it,</HI> And the <HI>Psalmist</HI> speaks of such as are <HI>plant∣ed</HI> in God's House, that they shall <HI>still</HI> bring forth Fruit in old Age. Psal 92 13, 14. <HI>Still</HI> bring forth Fruit — that is they shall <HI>continue to do, as they have done</HI> —Hence then, it follows, that God will be <HI>greatly</HI> glorified by <HI>them,</HI> in that <HI>they</HI> will bear <HI>much</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it; for, <HI>their</HI> virtuous Actions and pious Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcises will be <HI>frequently</HI> repeated: <HI>The sooner</HI> Persons begin to do well, the more Days they have to spend in the Service of God; and the more Days they have to spend, the more Duties are to be perform∣ed; and the more Duties they perform, the more <HI>Glory</HI> will redound to the Name of God. In a Word;</P>
<P>It is undeniable, that <HI>Sin</HI> is the abomina∣ble Thing which the Soul of God hates: It is <HI>this</HI> by which his holy Law is violat∣ed, and his curious Workmanship in his Creature, Man, abused: It is <HI>this,</HI> and this <HI>alone,</HI> which reflects <HI>Dishonour</HI> to the Name of God: So then; for Persons to devote them∣selves to the Service of <HI>Christ</HI> in their <HI>early</HI> Days, must needs be very <HI>pleasing</HI> to him; be∣cause
<PB N="32" REF="004413_0022_100D501FC38A5770"/>
by <HI>this</HI> Means, <HI>instead</HI> of <HI>dishonouring</HI> him by their Transgressions, they <HI>honour</HI> him by Acts of Obedience: Yea and they <HI>'scape</HI> Abun∣dance of <HI>Guilt</HI> and <HI>Pollution,</HI> which others con∣tract, and which they <HI>themselves</HI> would have contracted, were they not thus devoted and employed.</P>
<P>And I may add;</P>
<P>That when we behold <HI>Children religious∣ly disposed,</HI> we have a fair <HI>Prospect</HI> of <HI>Re∣ligion's</HI> being <HI>transmitted</HI> and <HI>propagated</HI> to those, who are yet <HI>to be born</HI>; and that <HI>they also,</HI> shall be to the <HI>Lord,</HI> for <HI>a Name</HI> and <HI>a Praise:</HI> Which Prospect moves the Peo∣ple of God to <HI>bless</HI> and <HI>magnify</HI> his holy <HI>Name</HI>; as also, ministers much <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> unto <HI>them</HI>; for truly, this is their great Desire, that <HI>such</HI> may survive them, who shall be counted to the Lord, for a <HI>Ge∣neration</HI>; yea, that the Name of the Lord may have <HI>Glory</HI> from the Children of Men, even unto <HI>all</HI> Generations.</P>
<P>These Things might easily be enlarg'd up∣on; but I <HI>hasten</HI> to the</P>

Thus King <HI>David</HI> call'd them together, as you may see, in Psal. 34 11. <HI>Come ye Children, hearken unto me</HI>: Then we have the good <HI>Lesson,</HI> which he taught them, as in the 12, 13, and 14 Verses. — And King <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> informs us, that he took the same Me∣thod, and that he was excited to it by his Father's Example. Prov. 4.1, 2, 3, 4. — Also, we find the Apostle <HI>John</HI> taking No∣tice of <HI>little Children,</HI> and directing his Speech <HI>to them,</HI> as well as to Fathers, and to young Men. 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.13.

Yea, and it is very of∣fensive to him, not only, when <HI>Children</HI> run into Sins of Commission, but also, when they <HI>omit</HI> their Duty; whether of Prayer and Praise towards him, or of Obedience and Respect towards their Parents, Brethren and Sisters, or any other—: And he will reckon with them for all their Sins, both of Omissi∣on and Commission; and particularly, for <HI>their Forgetfulness of God their Saviour,</HI> un∣less they repent, and bring forth Fruit meet for Repentance.</P>
<P>And here, I might go on to say; that if the Lord be displeased with the <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llies</HI> and <HI>Neg∣lects</HI> of <HI>Children,</HI> then, doubtless, he is al∣so

Such of them, who are not righteous, sober, and pious in their Conversation, do <HI>offend</HI> the Lord: Yea, if they live in Sins of <HI>Om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion</HI> only, suppose <HI>Prayer,</HI> and the like; or, if they perform the same <HI>but seldom,</HI> or, if after a <HI>careless</HI> Manner, and with a <HI>lukewarm</HI> Spirit; the <HI>Lord observes</HI> it, and is <HI>angry</HI> with them. And if they have, as they imagine, been ve∣ry careful to do their Duty to God, yet, if they have been <HI>negligent</HI> of doing their Duty toward their <HI>fellow Creatures,</HI> the Lord <HI>re∣sents</HI> it as <HI>Rebellion</HI> against him.— Where∣fore, it nearly concerns all <HI>such Persons,</HI> to repent and reform.</P>
<P>Yea, and seeing the <HI>Lord</HI> is <HI>displeased</HI> with the <HI>Follies</HI> of <HI>Children,</HI> surely, it concerns us all, who <HI>are past our Childhood,</HI> to <HI>bewail</HI> it that we <HI>have spent that Age</HI> of Life <HI>so foolishly.</HI> We should reflect, I say, upon our <HI>Childhood,</HI> and call to Mind, as far as we can, the Sins of our <HI>Childhood</HI> and <HI>Youth,</HI> as well as of our riper Years, and repent there∣of, and humble ourselves therefor, before the Lord.</P>

of; but, should consider, that God knows them, and will reckon with us for them, if we refuse, or carelessly neglect, to call ourselves to Account for the same: And, if we seriously reflect, we shall, doubtless, <HI>see Reason,</HI> to humble and abhor ourselves for such Sins as these, <HI>viz.</HI> for neglecting to seek after God in our <HI>Childhood</HI>; as also, for taking his holy Name in vain; and for prophaning his Day, by Play, or, by Idle∣ness: And moreover, for Misbehaviour to∣wards our Parents, and Brethren, and Sisters, and School-Fellows, in <HI>that Age</HI> of Life—: "Time does not wear out the Guilt of Sin; and therefore, the Faults and Follies of our <HI>Childhood,</HI> ought to be Matter of our Re∣pentance and Humiliation <HI>still.</HI>"</P>

<P><PB N="38" REF="004413_0025_100D5026F8EE0538"/><HI>Some of you</HI> have already made a good Be∣ginning; and <HI>we thank God,</HI> who has thus dispos'd and inclin'd you: O, <HI>bewa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> lest you grow weary of, and draw back from, the Way of Well-doing It is very sinful, and very hazardous, for any to do so; wherefore, do not hearken to any Tempta∣tions to Apostacy—.</P>

<P N="1">1. I shall speak by Way of MOTIVE.</P>
<P>And <HI>that</HI> in the <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Doctrine</HI> before us, is indeed a very <HI>weighty</HI> one, namely, that <HI>Christ is pleased with the Devotions of Children</HI>: And all who know how to value the <HI>Favour</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> will look upon <HI>this,</HI> as a <HI>sufficient</HI> Encouragement:— But, seeing there are many, who <HI>know not</HI> the <HI>Worth</HI> of this Favour, I shall present you with <HI>some other</HI> Considerations, <HI>not omitting this</HI> as I go along.</P>
<P>Mot 1 There have been <HI>many Examples</HI> of Persons, seeking after the Lord, and behav∣ing themselves discreetly, and piously, <HI>in their Childhood.</HI></P>
<P>It is recorded of our blessed <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> himself, that, when he was <HI>twelve</HI> Years
<PB N="39" REF="004413_0025_100D5026F8EE0538"/>
old, he was in the <HI>Temple, hearing the Doc∣tors, and asking them Questions</HI>; and the Reason, which he gave for it, was, because <HI>he must be about his Father's Business.</HI> Luk. 2.42, 46, 49. And, by so doing, he has set <HI>Children</HI> an <HI>Example,</HI> of repairing to the House of God for Instruction: Furthermore, we find in the 51<HI>st</HI> Verse of that Chapter, that <HI>he was subject to his Parents</HI>; and so, has <HI>taught Children</HI> to be <HI>obedient</HI> to their Father and Mother. I say, CHRIST <HI>has left you an Example, that you should follow his Steps.</HI>—We also read of <HI>Timothy,</HI> that <HI>from a Child he had known the holy Scriptures,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.15. And this, my <HI>Children,</HI> is writ∣ten for <HI>your</HI> Instruction, and to quicken <HI>you</HI> to learn your Book, and especially, to study <HI>the Scriptures,</HI> that you may know your Du∣ty, in order to do it. And, besides these, and some others, upon Record, in the BIBLE, there has been an Account of several <HI>Chil∣dren since,</HI> who were <HI>remarkable</HI> for their Seriousness and Piety; as may be seen in a little Book, entitled, <HI>A Token for Children,</HI> written by Mr. <HI>James Janeway</HI> —Yea, there have been sundry Examples of <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> in this <HI>Country,</HI> in whom the Fear of God remarkably appear'd; some of which are publish'd in the <HI>latter Part</HI> of Mr. <HI>Jane∣way</HI>'s <HI>Token,</HI> just now mention'd.</P>
<P>Now I say, <HI>you</HI> ought to follow the Ex∣ample of <HI>such Children</HI>; otherwise you won't suitably improve the <HI>History,</HI> which <HI>divine
<PB N="40" REF="004413_0026_100D502979F56AE8"/>
Providence</HI> has put into your Hands, concer¦ning them.</P>
<P>Mot. 2 Consider farther, that it is alto∣gether <HI>just</HI> and <HI>reasonable,</HI> that <HI>you betimes</HI> engage in the Service of God. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) It is the <HI>Commandment</HI> of <HI>God</HI> un∣to <HI>you,</HI> to seek <HI>first,</HI> and <HI>before</HI> all other Things, the Kingdom of God and his Righ∣teousness, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.33. And his Command∣ments are all holy, just, and good.—</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The <HI>Lord deserves</HI> your Love and Esteem, your Service and Obedience, more than any other: Has he not made, and pre∣served you? And has not <HI>Christ</HI> laid down his Life to redeem you from Destruction? And does he not offer actually to save you from your Sins, and from the Wrath to come, and to give you an Inheritance among them that are sanctified? Yes, verily: Then, doubtless, the Lord <HI>deserves</HI> your Love and Service. <HI>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing,</HI> Rev. 5.12. And not only worthy that Strength should be <HI>ascribed</HI> to him; but also, that the <HI>first,</HI> and even the <HI>whole</HI> of your strength should be <HI>devoted</HI> to him, and <HI>improved for him</HI>: And <HI>you</HI> will be, not on∣ly ungratefull, but very unjust, and rebelli∣ous also, if <HI>you</HI> refuse or delay to be obedi∣ent —And you may be further convinced of the Reasonableness of what I exhort you unto, if you consider,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="41" REF="004413_0026_100D502979F56AE8"/>(3.) That <HI>you</HI> are <HI>already devoted</HI> to the <HI>Lord,</HI> inasmuch as you have been <HI>baptized</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI>; for, your <HI>Baptism</HI> lays <HI>you</HI> under <HI>Engagements</HI> to be the Lord's, as your <HI>Cate∣chism</HI> instructs you: The Nature of Baptism is such, that <HI>it binds</HI> to present and perpetu∣al Obedience: So that, for <HI>you,</HI> after you are come to Years of Understanding, to <HI>de∣lay</HI> to seek after the God of your Fathers, is plainly to <HI>rob God</HI> of his Due: It is to dis∣regard your Baptism, and put Contempt upon that; as well as to undervalue the Good-Will of your Parents, in making a Dedica∣tion of you to the Lord; by which Act of theirs, they have not only obeyed the Com∣mandment of the Lord, but have indeed done <HI>you</HI> very great <HI>Honour</HI>—: And moreover, the Truth is, your Baptism will prove of unspeakable <HI>Advantage to you,</HI> if it be not <HI>your own Fault</HI>; for, Baptism not only o∣bliges you to Obedience; but, moreover, the <HI>Blessings</HI> of Goodness are thereby made over and secured to you, <HI>provided</HI> you do become willing and obedient —.</P>
<P>To proceed,</P>
<P>Mot. 3. It is very <HI>hazardous</HI> for <HI>you</HI> to <HI>de∣lay</HI> the doing what you can <HI>to please Christ.</HI> You are condemned in Law already, for <HI>you are Children of Wrath by Nature</HI>; and then besides, <HI>you</HI> have contracted a great deal of Guilt <HI>since</HI> your Birth. And <HI>you</HI> are in the Hands of <HI>that God,</HI> whom you have offen∣ded,
<PB N="42" REF="004413_0027_100D502BA19820D0"/>
and who can easily stop your Breath, and send you to Hell when he pleaseth: And he will do it e'er long, <HI>unless</HI> you do the Things that <HI>please him.</HI> As for your <HI>Pa∣rents,</HI> they are oftentimes ignorant of what <HI>you</HI> say and do amiss, but <HI>God</HI> is <HI>not</HI>: Yea, I have heard of some Parents, who, when in∣formed of their <HI>Children's</HI> foul Language or ill Behaviour, would not so much as check and admonish them for it; but only reply, <HI>'Tis like Children,</HI> and so let it pass: But truly, God will reckon with them. Rev. 20 12 I saw the Dead, <HI>small and great,</HI> stand before God, and the Books were open∣ed—. And, I say, <HI>you</HI> are in Danger, <HI>Chil∣dren, every Moment,</HI> of being summoned to make your Appearance before your Judge. Prov. 27.1. <HI>Boast not thy self of To-morrow,</HI> whosoever thou art, <HI>for thou knowest not what a Day shall bring forth.</HI> —But suppose, you should be spared, and your Lives be lengthened out, yet, if you neglect the <HI>pre∣sent Age</HI> of Life, and Season of Grace, God <HI>may</HI> deny you the Grace to repent afterwards. And furthermore, suppose the Lord should not utterly abandon you for your <HI>present</HI> Neglect, yet you'l certainly find it much more difficult, to cease to do evil, and to learn to do well, hereafter; for, repeated Acts strengthen the Habits of Sin daily, more and more: It will <HI>never</HI> be <HI>so easy</HI> to repent and turn to the Lord, <HI>as now.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="004413_0027_100D502BA19820D0"/>Mot. 4 <HI>You</HI> shall be <HI>abundantly rewarded</HI> for your Service, if you <HI>now</HI> become willing and obedient.</P>
<P>None shall loose any Thing, at long run, by being religious: <HI>In keeping God's Com∣mandments there is great Reward</HI>; as might be shewn in a <HI>few Particulars.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) This is the Way to have <HI>Life pro∣longed</HI> in this World; which is the <HI>very</HI> Mo∣tive made Use of by the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> with the <HI>Children</HI> whom he called together, to in∣struct in the Fear of the Lord; as you may see in <HI>Psal.</HI> 34.11, 12, 13, 14. But don't mistake me, for I don't intend, that <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>God</HI> shall certainly live <HI>to Old-Age</HI>: Many, who are regenerate, without Doubt, die in their <HI>Infancy</HI>; and other gra∣cious Ones have been taken out of the World in their <HI>Childhood,</HI> soon after they were ca∣pable of expressing their Hatred of Sin, and their Love to <HI>Christ,</HI> and his Commandments: Others in their <HI>Youth,</HI> soon after they have <HI>begun</HI> to serve God, and their Generation in the World. And thus it is, <HI>partly</HI> in Wrath, for the Punishment of the Ingratitude of a wicked World; and <HI>partly</HI> in Favour to themselves; for God takes them away from the Evil to come, they having, thro' Grace, done the Work assigned them, and being ripe for Heaven.</P>
<P>Again: Neither do I intend, that <HI>all</HI> such who live to <HI>Old-Age, are</HI> the <HI>Children of God</HI>: It is a <HI>sad</HI> Truth, that some aged Persons are
<PB N="44" REF="004413_0028_100D502DD18751E8"/>
vain and wicked; the older they grow, the worse they grow; as they advance in Years, and draw nearer to the Grave, they become more ripe for Destruction.
<Q><HI>The Sinnner, tho' he live to be an hundred Years old, shall be accursed</HI>; his living so long, shall be no Token to him of the divine Favour &amp; Bles∣sing, nor shall it be any Shelter to him from the divine Wrath and Curse; the Sentence he lies under will certainly be executed, and his long Life is but a long <HI>Reprieve</HI>: Nay, it is, itself, a Curse to him, for the longer he lives, the more Wrath he trea∣sures up against the Day of Wrath, and will have the more Sins to answer for.</Q></P>
<P>So that I don't intend, that the Children of God, and they only, shall certainly live to a great Age in this World; but my mean∣ing is, that Life shall be enjoyed by them, <HI>so long,</HI> and so far as it shall be for God's Glory, and their Good; and that's eno', and as much as any well disposed Person would desire. We read, that <HI>The Child shall dye an hundred Years old,</HI> Isai. 65.20 Which teacheth us, that when a <HI>Child</HI> dies, being in Favour with <HI>Christ,</HI> it may not be reckon∣ed to die <HI>untimely:</HI> 'When a <HI>Child</HI> dies, that is <HI>eminent</HI> for Wisdom and Grace, above many who are more in Years, it may be said to die an hundred Years old.'</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Such as <HI>please Christ,</HI> not only take the best Course that they <HI>can</HI> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssibly take, to have Life prolonged in this World, but
<PB N="45" REF="004413_0028_100D502DD18751E8"/>
moreover, they are in the best Way <HI>to pros∣per.</HI> Our blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> has graciously promis'd, That <HI>all these Things shall be ad∣ded to those, who seek</HI> FIRST <HI>the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness,</HI> Mat. 6.33. And the <HI>Psalmist</HI> informs <HI>Children,</HI> that if they would <HI>see good Days,</HI> they must be good, and do good, (forecited <HI>Psal.</HI> 34.12, 13, 14.) And the <HI>Apostle</HI> to the same Purpose, in 1 Tim. 4.8. <HI>Godliness is profitable unto all Things, having Promise of the Life that now is</HI>—. And of the <HI>godly</HI> Man, it is said. in <HI>Psal</HI> 1 3. <HI>Whatsoever he doth shall pros∣per</HI>—: But yet the Words are not to be look'd upon as an <HI>absolute</HI> Promise, but as <HI>conditional</HI>; namely, so far as shall be con∣sistent with the Glory of God, and the best Good of his Servants; and who could de∣sire more?</P>
<P N="3">(3) Such who make it their Care to <HI>please Christ,</HI> are in the most likely Way to <HI>take Comfort</HI> in what they <HI>do,</HI> or <HI>shall</HI> possess or enjoy, whether it be little or much: Now <HI>Godliness with Contentment is great Gain</HI>; And the Truth is, They are most proper∣ly the <HI>rich</HI> People, who have a <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of this World's Goods, and are <HI>content</HI> there∣with, and <HI>thankful</HI> therefor: They are very much mistaken, who imagine, that the only way to be comfortable, is, to enjoy Abun∣dance; for, as the wise Man observeth, <HI>the Eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the Ear filled with hearing,</HI> Eccl, 1.8. And a grea∣ter
<PB N="46" REF="004413_0029_100D502FEA9123F8"/>
than <HI>Solomon</HI> informs us, in Luk 12.15 That <HI>a Man's Life consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teth not in the Abundance of the Things which he poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sseth</HI>▪ It is too too evident, that some Persons live very mi∣serably, who yet have Plenty of this World's Goods: They possess Abundance, and yet have but little Comfort of it. <HI>They bereave their Souls of Good,</HI> Eccl. 4.8. They are discontented and fretful. as <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Ha∣man</HI>; and then, What Good does their A∣bundance do them? But, on the other Hand, some pass thro' the World with a great deal of Comfort, who, yet have but little of the Wealth of it. Now, I say, such as have but little, and yet have the Grace to be content, are <HI>truly rich.</HI></P>
<P>But, you must observe, that I am speaking, all this while, of the <HI>Grace</HI> of Contentment, as <HI>that</HI> which is <HI>enriching</HI>; for, there are some, who appear to be <HI>easy</HI> with their Con∣dition, tho' it be but mean▪ and yet are <HI>des∣titute</HI> of <HI>this Grace:</HI> Their Easiness proceeds from Inconsideration, &amp; from a Spirit of Sloth and Carelessness: They are a tho'tless Ge∣neration; have not the Wisdom of the <HI>Ant</HI>; but are rather like to the <HI>Horse</HI> and <HI>Mule,</HI> which have no Understanding.</P>
<P>The Truth is, such as are <HI>properly content,</HI> are diligent in their Business, according to their Ability; and well satisfied with the Portion which divine Providence curves out unto them: These Men do certainly eye the Hand of God in all Things; and if God
<PB N="47" REF="004413_0029_100D502FEA9123F8"/>
gives them <HI>but little,</HI> yet they are thankful, as knowing that the Lord may do what he will with his own, and being sensible that they are less than the least of all the Mercies of God.</P>
<P>Now certainly, such a Man has a truly <HI>excellent Spirit,</HI> who can accommodate him∣self to every Condition of Life, and carry an equal Temper of Mind thro' all the Vici∣ssitudes of his State, saying, after the <HI>Apostle,</HI> Phil. 4 11, 12. <HI>I have learned, in whatsoever State I am, therewith to be content</HI>; adding those Words, in v. 13. <HI>I can do all Things thro' Christ, who strengtheneth me.</HI>— And the Truth is, none may expect this <HI>Strength</HI> to be granted unto them, but those <HI>who de∣vote themselves</HI> to the Service of <HI>Christ,</HI> and profess to have their humble <HI>Dependance</HI> on him for <HI>Strength</HI> to <HI>enable</HI> them to perform their Duties in Sincerity, and to accept their Mercies thankfully, and to resign their Wills to his Will, under all the Circumstances of Life.</P>
<P>And among the Servants of the Lord, none may, on better Ground, expect to have this Strength granted to them, than those who do <HI>betimes engage</HI> in the <HI>Exercises</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise: God is good to Israel, to those that are of a clean Heart</HI>; but especially to those who <HI>early</HI> seek his Face and Favour. They have the <HI>same</HI> Promises to plead, which others have; such as that, <HI>They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their Strength.</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="004413_0030_100D5031DCD220C8"/>
—And moreover, they have particular Promises for to build their Hope upon; such as that, <HI>They that seek Me early, shall find Me.</HI> And that, <HI>The Lord never said to the Seed of Jacob, seek ye Me in vain</HI>: which is as much as to say, <HI>seek, and you shall find Me.</HI></P>
<P>And now I say, <HI>Contentment</HI> being that which <HI>sweetens</HI> Life, O how greatly should this <HI>encourage</HI> Persons to become the Lord's Servants <HI>betimes</HI>; and even <HI>while</HI> they are <HI>Children,</HI> to <HI>inure</HI> themselves to the religious Exercises of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI>?</P>
<P N="4">(4.) To endeavour to <HI>please Christ</HI> now in your <HI>Childhood,</HI> and so in the <HI>following</HI> Ages of Life, is the best Way to make <HI>great Proficiency</HI> in the Graces and Vertues of the divine Life, and to become <HI>strong</HI> in the Grace which is in <HI>Christ Jesus</HI>; and consequently; more and more like unto God, and so the more fit for Service in this World, and ripe for Glory in the other — I say, <HI>the sooner</HI> Persons begin, if they are careful to proceed, and go on in the good Way, they will at∣tain to a greater Growth and Increase in Knowledge and Grace, than others who do not begin so soon; as it is written, <HI>then shall you know, if you follow on to know the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now, certainly this ought to be look'd upon by <HI>you,</HI> as a very <HI>weighty</HI> Motive, to excite you to the Duties of Religion; For what in this Life can be so desireable, as Grace and Growth therein? Surely nothing here below may be liken'd to it: <HI>All the Things
<PB N="49" REF="004413_0030_100D5031DCD220C8"/>
which you can desire, are not to be compared with it:</HI> It is infinitely better than Gold, even the most fine Gold.</P>
<P>You are very much inclin'd, I am sensible, to take Delight in <HI>Baubles</HI>: But, <HI>my Chil∣dren,</HI> I must inform you, that these Things will not profit you; they are all <HI>Vanity,</HI> and even such as <HI>you yourselves</HI> will be asham'd of as you grow older: Wherefore, be advi∣sed to regard those Things less; and even <HI>now</HI> in your <HI>Childhood,</HI> to look upon them but as <HI>Toys</HI> and <HI>Trifles,</HI> and instead thereof, to mind your <HI>Books,</HI> and to take Care of your precious <HI>Souls.</HI> Endeavour, I say, to know your Duty, and to put the same in Practice, <HI>now betimes</HI>; and this is the Way to be <HI>early</HI> qualified for the Service of God, and of your Generation; and so you will, probably, in your <HI>youthful</HI> Days bring Glory to the Name of God, and be instrumental of Good unto others: And truly, this Con∣sideration ought to be of <HI>very</HI> great Weight with you; for, What were you born for, but to honour God, and to serve your Genera∣tion; or, to <HI>get</HI> Good, and to <HI>do</HI> Good, aim∣ing at the <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in both?</P>
<P>And verily, this will not only be a Favour and Kindness unto <HI>others,</HI> for you to do them Service; but also it will be of Service to <HI>yourselves</HI>; for hereby you'l make <HI>Advan∣ces</HI> Heavenward, and be laying up in <HI>Store</HI> against the Time to come, when none of your good Services shall be forgotten, or
<PB N="50" REF="004413_0031_100D5033815E7E90"/>
pass unrewarded; for God will render to every one according to his Works: He that does most for God, provided it be done in Sincerity, and with christian Prudence, shall receive the most distinguishing Reward.</P>
<P>And in a Word, HEAVEN will be <HI>your Portion</HI> if you <HI>now</HI> become the <HI>Lord's Chil∣dren</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI>; and this will be infinitely better than any Portion which your <HI>earthly Parents</HI> can possibly bestow upon you. As it is written, <HI>The Lord will give Grace and Glory, and no good Thing will be withold from them that walk uprightly.</HI> And now what greater Encouragement can be laid be∣fore you? <HI>One Hour's</HI> Enjoyment of <HI>Heaven</HI> is preferable to all the Honours, Profits, and Pleasures of this vain World: <HI>Then,</HI> and <HI>there,</HI> you shall enjoy <HI>God</HI> your Maker, and <HI>Christ</HI> your Redeemer, and the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> your Sanctifier, without any Interuption: <HI>There</HI> also you shall enjoy the Society of <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Angels,</HI> and be employ'd in no other Exercises but such as are holy and de∣lightful.</P>
<P>Thus we have consider'd the <HI>fourth Motive, namely,</HI> That you shall be <HI>abundantly rewar∣ded</HI> for your <HI>early</HI> Piety, if adher'd to, and persever'd in. And indeed, <HI>Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard, neither has entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, what God hath laid up for them that love him</HI></P>

<P>Then <HI>your Parents</HI> will be full of Joy on <HI>your</HI> Behalf: Pious Parents have no greater Joy than to see that <HI>their Children</HI> are wal∣king in the Truth, and exercising themselves to have always a Conscience void of Offence. This truly will minister more Joy <HI>to them</HI> than your <HI>first</HI> Birth did: Now you ought, without doubt, to <HI>labour</HI> to <HI>please</HI> them, who are the Instruments of your Being, and who are wishing and endeavouring your Welfare continually; and if you do not, you will prove yourselves very ungrateful indeed.</P>
<P>Also, <HI>you</HI> will greatly oblige <HI>your Minister</HI> by your <HI>early</HI> Piety: He desires the Good of your precious Souls, and would gladly promote the same <HI>all he can</HI>; and would fain give up his Account concerning you with Joy, and not with Grief; for that would be unprofitable for you.</P>
<P>Moreover, it would be very pleasing to the <HI>good Angels</HI> to see <HI>you</HI> piously employed; for we find in Luk. 15.10 That <HI>there is Joy in the Presence of the Angels of God, over one Sinner that repenteth.</HI> These holy ones <HI>delight</HI> to do the Will of God themselves, and consequently they are highly <HI>pleas'd,</HI> when they behold any of the Children of Men prevail'd with to do the like: They very gladly encamp about such, and minister to them for their Good, <HI>Psal</HI> 34 7. Now it is certainly very <HI>desireable</HI> to <HI>please</HI> this <HI>heavenly Host,</HI> who are capable either of
<PB N="52" REF="004413_0032_100D5036666A32B0"/>
preserving or destroying us, according as the Lord shall give them Order.</P>
<P>But more than all this, it ought to be con∣sider'd, that it will be <HI>very pleasing</HI> to the <HI>only living and true</HI> GOD, for <HI>you</HI> to become serious and religious, <HI>Now,</HI> in your <HI>Childhood.</HI> And it is certainly both your Duty and In∣terest to <HI>please Him</HI>; for he is <HI>your Creator,</HI> he has made you, and not you yourselves; And whom should you serve but the GOD that <HI>made you? O come let us worship and bow down,</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>let us kneel be∣fore the Lord our Maker,</HI> Psal. 95.6. More∣over, consider that this same GOD is <HI>your Preserver</HI>; he has cared <HI>for you</HI> in that Age of Life when you were not capable of taking Care of yourselves, and has, by the Ministry of his Angels, sav'd you from innumerable Evils: And it is <HI>his</HI> Corn, and Wool, and Flax, and Milk, which you have been spen∣ding upon: All your Strength is from him, and by his Blessing upon your Enjoyments: Wherefore, I say, it is highly reasonable that <HI>you study</HI> to <HI>please him,</HI> by spending your Strength in his Service, and to his Glo∣ry. O! <HI>beware</HI> of giving the LORD Reason to complain, that altho' he has formed and nourished you, yet you rebel against him. Yea, furthermore, let it be consider'd, that you have not only hitherto liv'd upon his Bounty, but <HI>must continue</HI> to do so as long as you live; and therefore it will certainly be your Interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do the Things which

<HI>please</HI> him —And let it not be forgot∣ten, how that the LORD JE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>US CHRIST has given Evidence of his unparallel'd Love and Good Will to the Children of Men, and <HI>to you</HI> among others: This Love of his appea∣red by what he submitted unto in his In∣fancy, Childhood, and Youth; and even from his Birth to his Death; for he was all the while a <HI>Witness</HI> to the People, of his own &amp; of his Father's <HI>Good Will</HI> towards Man: And agreably, we have that <HI>Doxology</HI> in Luk. 2.14 <HI>Glory to God in the higest, on Earth Peace, and Good Will towards Men.</HI> O! Let it be seriously considered, that our LORD JESUS CHRIST spent his Time, his Strength, his Blood, in the great Work of Man's Redemption, and is now in Heaven making Intercession for Sinners; yea, and is often striving with them by the <HI>holy Spi∣rit</HI>; and I trust <HI>with you</HI> among others, for your Good: Be perswaded therefore, now, I say, to shew forth your Love <HI>to him,</HI> by devoting yourselves to his Service; and be not backward to spend your Time and Strength in doing the Work which he has given you to do. Certainly you would think CHRIST worthy of your <HI>best</HI> and of your <HI>all,</HI> if you did seriously consider who he is, what he has done, and what he is still doing for poor Sinners: But now, <HI>How can you</HI> devote your <HI>all</HI> unto him, un∣less you dedicate yourselves <HI>henceforth</HI> to be his Servants? O that his Love towards
<PB N="54" REF="004413_0033_100D50382037F490"/>
you, might prevail with you to do it! And this the rather, considering that it is the Way, as I said before, to have <HI>his</HI> Love <HI>confirm'd</HI> towards you, and even to <HI>secure</HI> a Part to yourselves, not only in his Benevolence and Benificence, but also in his <HI>Complacency</HI> and <HI>Delight,</HI> Prov. 8.17. <HI>I love them that love Me, and they that seek Me early shall find Me.</HI>
<Q>The <HI>Kindnesses</HI> of your <HI>Childhood</HI> and <HI>Youth</HI> are what the glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious <HI>God</HI> will take <HI>infi∣nite Complacency in</HI></Q>
<HI>John</HI> the <HI>youngest</HI> Disciple, was <HI>emphatically</HI> the Disciple whom <HI>Jesus loved.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you see that by becoming religious <HI>betimes,</HI> you will <HI>please</HI> the great God himself, also good Angels, and good Men: Not on∣ly Parents and Ministers, but others also; <HI>all</HI> the Lord's People would be <HI>pleased</HI> with it; this is what they pray for, and what they would rejoice to have the Opportunity and Occasion to give Thanks for.—And the Truth is, by this Means you would take the most effectual Method to gain <HI>Respect,</HI> even from such as <HI>have not</HI> a saving Principle within them: There are not many among Men, who don't <HI>secretly</HI> respect and reve∣rence those that fear the Lord: So vile a Man as <HI>Herod, feared</HI> John, <HI>and did many Things, and heard him gladly.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed such as are perfectly <HI>lost</HI> to all Sense of Goodness, they will malign and spite you, and so will the <HI>Devil</HI> himself; but what then? This may not be any Dis∣couragement

to you: These are Enemies to <HI>God</HI> himself, and consequently you ought to account them as <HI>your</HI> Enemies, and by no Means to gratify them, by following their evil Counsels: But, on the other Hand, you ought both to resist the Devil, and to de∣cline having any n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edless Familiarity with the Workers of Iniquity, and to say as the <HI>Psalmist. Depart from me, ye evil Doers, for I will keep the Commandments of my God.</HI></P>
<P>And I shall add, That if y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u will make it your great Care to <HI>please God,</HI> by hearkening to, and obeying his Voice, <HI>Now,</HI> in your <HI>Child∣hood</HI>; then, you may, with much more Rea∣son, hope and expect, that God will hear <HI>your Voice,</HI> and <HI>your Cry,</HI> in an <HI>evil</HI> Day: Then you may humbly plead that gracious Promise, in Psal 50.15 <HI>Call upon Me in the Day of Trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.</HI> This Word of Promise has been made good many a Time, to such who were <HI>early</HI> devoted to the Fear of God: <HI>Moses, David, Samuel, Hezekiah, Obadiah,</HI> and many others, who feared the Lord, and served him <HI>betimes,</HI> have found him to be a present Help in Times of Trouble: But, on the other Hand, if you will not labour to <HI>please</HI> the Lord, by hearkening to <HI>his</HI> Voice, <HI>why</HI> should you expect him to hear <HI>your</HI> Cry? Surely, you will have Reason to fear the contrary; for, the Lord hath said. <HI>Be∣cause I called, and ye refused, — I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll laugh at your Calamity, and mock when your Fear cometh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="004413_0034_100D503B21D84A98"/>In a Word; If <HI>you comply</HI> with what I am urging you unto, you will <HI>never</HI> see Reason to <HI>repent of it</HI>: And truly, by so doing, you will have the <HI>fewer Sins</HI> to repent of; for, it is the Way to be kept from many Sins, which <HI>young Ones</HI> are addicted unto, and which they are very often found guilty of: Without the Fear of God reigning in your Hearts, you can never conquer those impe∣tuous Lusts and Passions, which destroy Mul∣titudes of People: But, if you are religious <HI>betimes,</HI> then you'l prevent Corruption get∣ting Head against you; for, you'l engage <HI>God's gracious Presence with you,</HI> and so, you'l be guided by his Counsel, from Day to Day: And O happy you, if the <HI>Lord</HI> be your <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> and the <HI>Guide</HI> of your <HI>Childhood</HI> and <HI>Youth</HI>: And he <HI>will</HI> be so, if you do <HI>Now</HI> unfeignedly make Choice of him for such, and do submit yourselves to his Conduct and Government. The Steps of a good Man, and so, of <HI>a good Child,</HI> are ordered by the Lord; if he fall, yet, he shall arise again, for the Lord upholdeth him with his Hand. Now, the Consideration, that <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>best</HI> Way that <HI>you can</HI> take, to <HI>prevent Sin,</HI> and <HI>subdue Corruption,</HI> ought to be of <HI>very</HI> great Weight with you; for, verily. <HI>Sin</HI> will be found to be <HI>Something</HI> in <HI>Repentance,</HI> tho' accounted <HI>Nothing</HI> in the <HI>Commission.</HI></P>
<P>To add no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e by Way of Motive; Let it be consider'd, that <HI>early</HI> Piety will be of unspeakable <HI>Advantage</HI> to you, <HI>in all your

Ways, all your Days</HI>; and will be the <HI>best</HI> Provision that you can possibly make for Old Age and Death—: O, what a Sup∣port was it to <HI>Obadiah,</HI> that he cou'd say, <HI>I fear the Lord from my Youth.</HI> 1 Kings 18 12.

Verily, the Testimony of your Consciences, that in Simplicity, and godly Sincerity, by the Grace of God, you have had your Conversation in the World, will be found more valuable, and comfortable, than thousands of Gold and Silver, if you live to Old Age; and so, when you come to lye upon a Sick Bed.—Yea, you may receive it for a Truth, that if ever you re∣pent, it will grieve you at the Heart that you did not repent <HI>sooner</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Alas, Lord! said <HI>Austin,</HI> Nimis se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o te amare caepi.

willing and obedient Servants <HI>without any Delay</HI>; and hereby you will lay a sure Foundation, for a comfortable Life, a peace∣ful End, a joyful Account, and an happy Eternity.</P>
<P>I shall proceed in the next Place, to give you a few DIRECTIONS: And, in order to engage your Attention, I call upon you in the Words of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> viz <HI>Come ye Children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the Fear of the Lord,</HI> and shew you the Path of Life; which if <HI>you</HI> walk in, <HI>you</HI> shall find Rest to your Souls.</P>
<P><HI>Direct.</HI> I. <HI>Take Time</HI> to <HI>consider.</HI>—Seri∣ously consider, besides what has been men∣tion'd by Way of Motive, on <HI>these</HI> Things following:</P>
<P>Namely,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) On your <HI>present</HI> State and Condi∣tion: That you are indeed Children of Wrath <HI>by Nature,</HI> dead in Trespasses and Sins, and that in your Flesh there dwelleth no good Thing:— That you are Enemies to God in your Hearts, and bent unto Sin, to that only, and to that continually: <HI>Be∣hold</HI> you were shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did your Mothers conceive you, <HI>Psal</HI> 51.5. So that, God might have justly turned you down to Hell, presently after you were born; but, blessed be his holy Name, he has pitied and spared you, and so, has granted you a Space to repent in.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="004413_0035_100D503D767EFD20"/>Then consider, <HI>how</HI> you have spent your Time hitherto, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Vanity</HI>: Have done little, if any thing, for your precious Souls; but, on the contrary, have been go∣ing further off from God, and thereby ren∣dred yourselves more odious to his Holiness, and more obnoxious to his Wrath and Curse; so that, now, you are in imminent Hazard, every Moment, of being cut off by the Hand of Justice. — I say, you are under the condemning Sentence of the Law, as you are the <HI>Children</HI> of apostate <HI>Adam</HI>; and by your <HI>actual</HI> Rebellion, you have <HI>further</HI> confirm'd that Sentence against you: And altho' you have a <HI>Reprieve</HI> granted you, yet it is but for a <HI>short</HI> Space of Time; and how short you know not; there's <HI>daily</HI> Hazard that the Sentence will be ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuted; so that, I say, your <HI>present</HI> Condition is truly <HI>very dangerous.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) In the next Place; Consid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of the <HI>four last</HI> Things; <HI>viz Death Judgment H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aven</HI> &amp; <HI>Hell.</HI></P>
<P>—On <HI>Death</HI>; the Certainty of it, and the Uncertainty of the Time when: You may not, how young soever you be, boast of To∣morrow, for you know not what a Day shall bring forth <HI>Many Children</HI> have been snatch'd away by Death, especially of <HI>late</HI> Years; and you are as much expos'd to the fatal Stroak, as others—.</P>
<P>Then consider of the <HI>last Judgment</HI>; and endeavour to realize to yourselves, what an amazing Thing it will be to appear before <HI>Christ,</HI> in that Day, without the Wedding
<PB N="60" REF="004413_0036_100D503FED47ACC0"/>
Garment; that is, without the Justification of your Persons, and the Sanctification of your Natures; for, without this Garment, you may not have Admission into the King∣dom of Heaven: Without Holiness, no Man shall see the Lord.</P>
<P>Then, proceed to meditate on <HI>Heaven</HI>; which is a most glorious Place, and abideth forever: It is the City which hath Foun∣dations, whose Builder and Maker is <HI>God:</HI> There, the Saints shall glorify and enjoy the blessed God, World without End: There, they shall neither sin nor sorrow any more: Nothing shall ever separate them from <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Society of holy <HI>Angels.</HI> The Righteous shall go into Life eternal; and nothing shall offend in all that holy Mountain—: And <HI>little Children,</HI> as well as others, shall, if pardoned and renewed, be admitted into <HI>that</HI> most glorious Place, for our <HI>Saviour</HI> has said, <HI>of such is the King∣dom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; Meditate on <HI>Hell</HI>; which is a most doleful Place, where there is Wee∣ping, Wailing, and Gnashing of Teeth, for ever: Where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched: And into <HI>this</HI> Place, <HI>naughty Children,</HI> they remaining such, <HI>must</HI> be cast: For, all the wicked, <HI>younger</HI> as well as elder, shall be turned into Hell: They shall go away into everlasting Punishment. —Now, consider seriously with yourselves, can you bear your Finger, one Quarter of
<PB N="61" REF="004413_0036_100D503FED47ACC0"/>
an Hour, in our <HI>common</HI> Fire? How then, can you dwell in everlasting Burnings, and endure the Wrath of God to all Eternity? And yet, be assured, you shall bear it, <HI>unless</HI> you become <HI>good Children</HI>: God himself will uphold you, that he may punish you: His Power will sustain you, that he may glorify his Justice upon you—. O, con∣sider seriously, if you are once cast into Hell, you shall <HI>never, never</HI> come out thence: No Intreaties will prevail with God for your Redemption: Neither indeed, <HI>will</HI> your pi∣ous Friends pray for you, but will acquiesce in your Condemnation, and freely acknow∣ledge, that the Lord is righteous, and that his Ways are just and true.— Neither shall you obtain any <HI>Respit</HI> or Relief there, No; for, if you desire a single Drop of Water <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly,</HI> it will be deny'd you.</P>
<P>I say, consider of these Things, <HI>until</HI> you become full of Concern for your poor Souls, and <HI>how</HI> you shall escape the Wrath to come: And then,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Go on to consider, that <HI>there is Help</HI> laid upon One that is <HI>Mighty,</HI> even the dearly beloved, and only begotten <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God:</HI> And consider, that <HI>He</HI> is a <HI>suitable</HI> Sa∣viour, being <HI>both</HI> God and Man in one Per∣son: In him all fulness dwelleth; and he <HI>can</HI> easily supply all your Wants: He is in∣vested with a three-fold Office, in the Exe∣cution of which, he becomes the perfect Sa∣viour of his People.— And, he is not only
<PB N="62" REF="004413_0037_100D5041D183C7A8"/>
able, but <HI>willing</HI> to save, to the uttermost, all that come to God, by him. It is im∣possible for him to lie; and he has said, <HI>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> His Incarnation, his Doctrines, and Invita∣tions, the Joy which he express'd at the Ty∣dings of the Success of the Gospel, and the Sorrow which he discover'd on the Account of the Obstinacy and Unbelief of Sinners, his unwearyed Labours, Day and Night, and his healing all who sought to him for it; and in a Word, his whole Life, and his bitter Death, and his appointing the Gospel Mi∣nistry, and sending the Holy Spirit to strive with Sinners, and lastly, his making Inter∣cession for them himself, now, he is risen from the Dead, and ascended up into Hea∣ven, <HI>do sufficiently evince</HI> his <HI>Good-Will</HI> to∣wards the Children of Men: You may there∣fore be assured, that the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> is ready to accept of <HI>you,</HI> and to become <HI>your</HI> Saviour; provided, <HI>you</HI> ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve of his Terms and are unfeignedly wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to be under the Restraints, and to do the Duties, of his holy Religion; Or, if you will close with him, as <HI>your</HI> Priest, Prophet, and King; and hum∣bly depend upon him, to guide, govern and save you: —<HI>This</HI> is what Christ expects of you: And indeed, nothing can be more reasonable, than that the Person, on whom you depend for Salvation, should also guide and govern you. And the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h is, <HI>There is no other Name under Heaven, given among
<PB N="63" REF="004413_0037_100D5041D183C7A8"/>
Men, whereby you can be saved</HI>: There is no other, there <HI>needs</HI> no other, and there <HI>can</HI> be none better; neither is it possible, that any better Laws and Ordinances should be enacted than his are.</P>
<P>Consider of these Things, until you find and feel your <HI>Souls</HI> going forth, in earnest and fervent <HI>Longings</HI> after Christ; and, 'till you are brought to <HI>close</HI> with him, according to the Gospel.</P>
<P>O, that <HI>you</HI> would be perswaded, <HI>my Chil∣dren,</HI> to comply with <HI>this</HI> Part of your Duty; namely, <HI>To consider</HI> of your own wretched Estate and Condition by Nature, and of the Vanity of your <HI>Childhood,</HI> and the imminent Hazard, which you are in:— As also, of the spiritual Nature, and Extent, of the di∣vine Law; and of the four last Things, Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell; until you come to be awak'ned, and fill'd with Concern, about the Salvation of your preci∣ous and immortal S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uls.—And <HI>then,</HI> O, that you would meditate on <HI>Christ,</HI> as a suitable, mighty, and willing Saviour; and as the <HI>only</HI> Saviour of the Children of Men: If you will seriously think on these Things, then, and not 'till then, you will be in the Way of Life.—Let me tell you, there's little, if any, Hope, of a Person's Conversion unto God, <HI>until</HI> he becomes serious and con∣siderate; but, then there is Hope: <HI>Conside∣ration</HI> is, ordinarily, the <HI>first</HI> Step to Con∣version.</P>

<P>Bad Company has occasion'd the Destruction of many, both Body and Soul: And agreably, says the wise Man, <HI>A Companion of Fools shall be destroyed,</HI> Prov. 13.20. And elsewhere, he earnestly exhorteth Persons, and particu∣larly, <HI>young</HI> People, <HI>to avoid the Way of the Wicked</HI>; and plainly tells them, <HI>that if they would not be found in that Way, they must not pass by it, but turn from it, and pass away,</HI> Prov 4.15. And we find the <HI>Psalmist</HI> pro∣nouncing the Man blessed, <HI>who standeth not in the Way of Sinners</HI>—. Psal 1.1. So then, be able to say after him, <HI>I am a Com∣panion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts,</HI> Psal. 119.63. The Truth is, you cannot walk with God, if you take Pleasure in the Society of the Wicked: The <HI>Psalmist</HI> was sensible of it, and there∣fore said, Psal 119 115. <HI>Depart from me ye evil Doers, for I will keep the Commandments of my God.</HI>—And I shall further say, That if you are, at any Time, <HI>oblig</HI>'d to be in the Company of such, whether <HI>Children,</HI> or <HI>O∣thers,</HI> who are light and vain in their Con∣versation, then, be on your Watch; and fail not to lift up your Souls to God, entreating him, to preserve you from being infected by them; and moreover, be advised, to get out of their Company again, as soon as may be; for <HI>one Sinner destroyeth much Good.</HI> And, in a Word; follow not the <HI>bad</HI> Examples of

<P><HI>Dir</HI> 3 <HI>Get and keep in Mind the Deca∣logue, or the Ten Commandments.</HI>—And not only remember them, but also, labour to <HI>understand</HI> the Intent and Meaning of them; and that for this End, that so, you may duly observe and practice them.</P>
<P>I shall just mention them to you—:</P>
<P>The <HI>First</HI> Commandment <HI>obliges</HI> you to worship and serve the <HI>living</HI> and <HI>true</HI> God; and <HI>forbids</HI> the giving of divine Honour to <HI>any other.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Second enjoins</HI> you to worship and and serve the Lord in the Ways of <HI>his own Appointment,</HI> and <HI>no other</HI> Ways.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third forbids</HI> your <HI>taking the Name of God in vain</HI>; which is an Evil too too com∣mon with some <HI>Children,</HI> and <HI>young</HI> Folks: —The Name of God, such as, his Titles, Attributes, Ordinances, Word, and Works, should be always used, both by <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Young,</HI> with godly Fear and Reverence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fourth</HI> Commandment <HI>requires</HI> you to <HI>remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy.</HI> —This I shall a little <HI>enlarge upon,</HI> and in∣form you, that you must beware of playing on the Lord's Day, also of Laughter, and idle Talk: —You may play a little on other Days, with your Parent's Leave, but not at all on the Sabbath-Day: God, your Maker, and your Saviour, has strictly <HI>forbid∣den</HI> you; and it is very dangerous to dis∣please

GOD is upon you. —There is scarce a greater Token for Good, than for <HI>Children</HI> to be devout, and serious, in the <HI>immediate</HI> Service of GOD —Labour to <HI>bear in Mind that Instance</HI> in the Text, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Chil∣dren's</HI> crying <HI>Hosanna</HI> to the <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> in the <HI>Temple</HI>; and <HI>how pleasing</HI> it was to CHRIST, that they did so; and do <HI>you</HI> maintain the <HI>like devout</HI> Frame, in <HI>all your</HI> Addresses to GOD, in publick, private and secret.</P>
<P>And, When you have obtained the Know∣ledge of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of the Covenant, and understand the Nature, End, and Use of the Sacraments, and find within yourselves, an ardent Love to <HI>Christ,</HI> and that you do de∣light in your Duty, <HI>then,</HI> proceed to make a <HI>personal</HI> Dedication of <HI>yourselves</HI> to the LORD JEHOVAH; desiring, and resolving, by the Help of his Grace, to walk in <HI>all</HI> his Ordinances, and Commandments, blame∣less. — Be not rash with your Mouths, nei∣ther let your Hearts be hasty, to utter any Thing before <HI>God.</HI> Count the Cost of Re∣ligion, <HI>before</HI> you oblige yourselves to com∣ply with the Laws of it, otherwise, there is very little Likelihood of your being stedfast in the same: And if you should draw back, then your Condition will be worse than before.</P>
<P>Finally;</P>
<P>Be not discouraged from Well-doing, ei∣ther by the Words, or Works, of vain Peo∣ple,
<PB N="83" REF="004413_0047_100D505A66A5F778"/>
whether <HI>elder,</HI> or <HI>younger.</HI> Seriously meditate on that Text of Scripture, in Mar. 8 last, <HI>Whosoever therefore, shall be ashamed of me, and of my Words, in this adulterous and sinful Generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father, with the holy An∣gels.</HI> And follow the good Example set you by <HI>Moses,</HI> of whom you read, in Heb. 11.25, 26. That, <HI>he chose rather to suffer Af∣fliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for a Season; and, that he esteemed the Reproach of Christ greater Riches than the Treasures in Egypt, for he had Respect to the Recompence of the Reward.</HI></P>
<P>And, I must tell you, that as <HI>you may not be discourag'd</HI> from the good Way of the <HI>Lord,</HI> by any thing which you see or hear, done, or said, by others; so, neither may <HI>any of you</HI> go about <HI>to discourage Others,</HI> from walking in that good Way: For, if you should, you will therein act directly contrary to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who came,</HI> as he tells us, himself, <HI>to seek and save that which is lost</HI>: And you may be sure, that he will be <HI>very angry with you,</HI> for opposing his Interest, and seeking to frus∣trate and disappoint the End of his coming into the World.</P>
<P>Your Duty, <HI>my Children,</HI> is, <HI>in the first Place, to seek the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness, yourselves</HI>; and then to endea∣vour <HI>to perswade others</HI> to do the like: <HI>Let
<PB N="84" REF="004413_0048_100D505C86FDAC40"/>
your Light so shine before others, that they seeing your good Works, may glorify your Fa∣ther, who is in Heaven. And exhort one a∣nother daily, while it is called to Day, lest any be hardned thro' the Deceitfulness of Sin</HI>: For, <HI>he that converteth a Sinner from the Er∣ror of his Ways, shall save a Soul from Death, and hide a Multitude of Sins</HI></P>
<P>And to <HI>conclude</HI> what I have to offer <HI>to you,</HI> at present; Be advised, to make Choice of the WORD <HI>of</HI> GOD for the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>your Lives,</HI> and as the <HI>Man of your Counsel,</HI> at all Times; and so acknowledge and sub∣mit to God, as <HI>the Guide of your Childhood</HI> and <HI>Youth.</HI>—O! Walk not in the Ways of your Hearts, and after the Sight of your Eyes; but, order your Steps in God's Word, and let no Iniquity of any kind, have Do∣minion over you.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>my Children,</HI> I have shewn you, what Things you must observe and do — And if <HI>you thus</HI> seek the <HI>Lord,</HI> he will be found of you; but, if you forsake him, and refuse to submit to the Government, and Conduct, of his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> then, he will cast you off forever.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as saith the <HI>wise Man,</HI> in Prov. 8.10, 11. <HI>Receive my Instruction and not Silver, and Knowledge rather than choice Gold; for Wisdom is better than Rubies; and all the Things that may be desired, are not to be compared to it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="004413_0048_100D505C86FDAC40"/>I proceed now to the <HI>other Branch</HI> of the <HI>Exhortation, viz</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="exhortation to parents">
<HEAD>II TO PARENTS, and ALL OTHERS, who have the <HI>Care of Children</HI> committed to them.</HEAD>
<P>And my Exhortation <HI>to you,</HI> is this, seeing <HI>Christ</HI> is <HI>pleased</HI> with the <HI>Children's Hosan∣nahs,</HI> be perswaded, to <HI>do all that in you lies</HI> that so, those who are in their <HI>Childhood,</HI> may <HI>praise</HI> the <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And here, I shall offer you something by Way of <HI>Motive,</HI> and then a few <HI>Directions,</HI> and so conclude this my Discourse.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let the Things which follow be seri∣ously considered, by Way of MOTIVE; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>your Children</HI> stand in <HI>absolute need of Help</HI>; being born, not only destitute of the <HI>true</HI> Knowledge of <HI>God,</HI> and of his Son <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Way</HI> to Life by him; but also, full of <HI>Enmity</HI> against the <HI>Lord,</HI> and against his <HI>Christ.—They need,</HI> I say, to be instructed in, and to be excited to, their Duty, being, by Nature, both, blind, and obstinate; wherefore, <HI>have Compassion</HI> on <HI>them,</HI> and <HI>help them</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Word of God</HI> obligeth us, <HI>as we have Opportunity to do Good to all, and especially to the Houshold of Faith</HI>; of which Houshold <HI>your Children</HI> are. — But then, besides this, <HI>Parents</HI> are <HI>expresly com¦manded</HI> to <HI>train up their Children in the Way they ought to go; and to bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord</HI>;
<PB N="86" REF="004413_0049_100D505E1CACA320"/>
and consequently, to use their utmost En∣deavour, to lead them unto <HI>Christ,</HI> and to promote their serving of him, in an <HI>active</HI> Way—And truly, Parents are, not only, obliged hereunto by the Commandment of <HI>God,</HI> but also, by Vertue of <HI>their covenanting</HI> with the <HI>Lord</HI>; for, in the Face of the Con∣gregation, we have solemnly <HI>promised</HI> to bring them up <HI>for him.</HI>—And I may add, that the <HI>Relation,</HI> which we bear to <HI>our Chil∣dren, as Parents,</HI> is a very strong Obliga∣tion upon us, to lead them unto <HI>Christ</HI> — How can we be said to do the Part of Pa∣rents towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; or, to answer the Cha∣racter of Father and Mother, unless, we la∣bour to promote the Welfare of their im∣mortal Souls? It cannot be: For, surely, it is not enough to provide them with Meat, Drink, and Cloathing; No; this is the least and the easiest Part of our Duty: We ought, especially, to have at Heart, their spiritual and eternal Interest: Which, if we have, we shall certainly endeavour to lead them unto CHRIST; and shall teach them to eye, and submit to him, as <HI>their</HI> Lord and Ruler, as well as <HI>their</HI> Saviour.</P>
<P>Furthermore, consider, that they <HI>soon be∣gin</HI> to be <HI>capable</HI> of receiving some Instruc∣tion in the <HI>Things</HI> of <HI>God</HI> Indeed, if they were destitute of a Capacity to receive Light and Knowledge, then, we might be justified in our Neglect; but the Case is not so; and therefore, we can never answer it,
<PB N="87" REF="004413_0049_100D505E1CACA320"/>
either to God, or our own Consciences; no, nor indeed, to <HI>our Children</HI> themselves, if we shall disregard their spiritual and eternal Welfare. Know we not, that if we neglect to promote the same, and <HI>our Children</HI> should die in their Iniquity, then <HI>God</HI> will require their Blood at our Hands: But, on the other Side, if we discharge our Duty towards them, then, we shall deliver our own Souls; yea, notwithstanding they continue impenitent, and die in their Sins.—And it may, pos∣sibly, be of Service, and for <HI>our</HI> quickening, seriously to consider after this Manner, <HI>viz. Suppose a Child of our's, come to Years of Understanding, and whose Soul we have ne∣glected to take Care of, should be taken away from us by Death</HI>; How could we, at such a Time, bear up under such a Thought as <HI>this, viz.</HI> I was the <HI>Instrument</HI> of this Child's Being, and the <HI>next Cause</HI> of it's <HI>natural Guilt</HI> and <HI>Pollution,</HI> and yet, <HI>have not taken due Care,</HI> that so, it might become a <HI>Servant</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>see</HI> the <HI>Salvation</HI> of <HI>God</HI>?— Certainly, such a Reflection as this would be very grievous indeed, and as a Sword in your Bones.—Wherefore, let us be pre∣vailed with, to endeavour, that there may not be any Occasion for it.</P>
<P>And now, is there any Need that I put you in mind of the <HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mples</HI> of <HI>good Men,</HI> which are upon Record, in the holy Scrip∣tures, in order to excite you to this your Duty? As that of <HI>Abraham,</HI> in <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.19.
<PB N="88" REF="004413_0050_100D505FAB33CC98"/>
and of <HI>Joshua,</HI> in <HI>Josh.</HI> 24 15 and of <HI>David,</HI> in <HI>Psal.</HI> 101. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word; The <HI>best Good</HI> of <HI>our Children</HI> loudly calls upon us, to do our utmost, to bring them to serve the LORD JESUS CHRIST. —And seeing, he is <HI>honoured by,</HI> and <HI>plea∣sed with,</HI> such <HI>Children,</HI> as are religiously disposed, certainly, it becomes and con∣cerns us, <HI>to,</HI> and if we have any Ingenuity in us, we <HI>shall,</HI> endeavour, that they may be <HI>early</HI> devoted to him.</P>
<P>I come now to offer you a few Words, by Way of <HI>Counsel</HI> and DIRECTION, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Let <HI>them</HI> be <HI>well taught.</HI> Care ought, without fail, to be taken, that they may learn to Read <HI>betimes,</HI> that so, they may be in a Capacity, to peruse the holy Scriptures, <HI>themselves</HI>; in order to know, and do, the Will of God. A very <HI>melancholy Sight</HI> this, to behold <HI>a Person</HI> come to Years of Un∣derstanding, <HI>not able to read.</HI>—It is very necessary, that <HI>Schools</HI> be set up, and en∣couraged, for this End, that <HI>Children</HI> may be taught to read, and that they may be <HI>early</HI> instructed in the Principles of our holy Religion.—And if any <HI>Children</HI> are not sent to School, by Reason of their Parent's <HI>Poverty</HI>; or, if some Parents send their <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> to School, who cannot well <HI>pay</HI> for their Schooling, it would be highly commendable in others, and an Act of <HI>Charity,</HI> to disburse Money to defray the Charge for them. When the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> in <HI>Psal</HI> 34 11. invited
<PB N="89" REF="004413_0050_100D505FAB33CC98"/>
<HI>Children</HI> to come, and hearken to him, and promised to teach them the Fear of the Lord▪ Perhaps, <HI>says One,</HI> he intended especially, those <HI>Children,</HI> whose Parents neglected to instruct and catechise them: And truly, it is as great a Piece of Charity to put those <HI>Children</HI> to School, whose Parents are not in a Capacity to teach them, as to feed those <HI>Children,</HI> whose Parents have not Bread for them to eat.—And I may add, that this Thing, if done with an Eye to the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and to the <HI>Welfare</HI> of such <HI>Children,</HI> and of the rising and risen Gene∣rations, will be Fruit <HI>abounding</HI> to our Ac∣count. This is to lay up in store against the Time to come: It is to put out Money to one of the best of Uses.—<HI>Thanks</HI> be to <HI>God,</HI> that he has inclined <HI>many</HI> Persons, in some Parts of the World, to dispose of some of their Incomes, to serve <HI>this</HI> good Inten∣tion, viz <HI>To support</HI> CHARITY SCHOOLS, for the sake of <HI>poor Children:</HI> And thro' the Favour of Heaven, we, in <HI>this Land,</HI> are not wholly destitute of such Instances of Goodness and Kindness: And, in an espe∣cial Manner, <HI>some good People</HI> in the Towns of BOSTON and SALEM, are said to be ex∣emplary for expending Money for <HI>such</HI> an Use: What <HI>they</HI> have done this Way is come abroad, and spoken of to their very great Honour, as also, to the Honour of our holy Religion, which hath had <HI>such</HI> Effect upon them, as to move them to <HI>so</HI> good a
<PB N="90" REF="004413_0051_100D50891D1465A0"/>
Work. The LORD think upon all such for Good, who have encourag'd and promoted this good Thing, and have from Time to Time contributed on this good Design! May they be inclined to go on! And will the LORD be pleased to bless their Persons, their Offspring, and their Substance; and may they live to see the good Effect of their Charity, with Respect to <HI>those poor Children,</HI> on whom their Money has been, or may be, expended.</P>
<P>But then, I would say further, that Care ought to be taken, not only, that <HI>Children</HI> may be taught to read, but also, that they <HI>do</HI> read in the BIBLE, <HI>every Day.</HI> Let Pa∣rents and Masters allow them Time for it and oblige them to observe it: Yea, and hear them read yourselves, at least, before your Family Prayers. And moreover, when∣ever they meet with a <HI>divine Sentence,</HI> which does, more especially, relate to <HI>their</HI> Age, Station, or Condition, it may be of singu∣lar Advantage, to <HI>observe</HI> it to them, and to <HI>call</HI> upon them, to <HI>keep it in Mind.</HI></P>
<P>And not only so, but you must provide them with some good <HI>Catechism,</HI> that, they may be instructed in the first Principles of the Oracles of God, and the fundamental Articles of our holy Religion. That of the <HI>Assembly of Divines</HI> I should most incline to recommend to you. And I beseech you frequently to examine, what Progress they make in their Learning: Not only, on <HI>Sa∣turday
<PB N="91" REF="004413_0051_100D50891D1465A0"/>
Evenings,</HI> and on the <HI>Lords Days</HI>; but also, at <HI>other</HI> Times, when you it in the House with them, propose a few Questions to them out of the <HI>Catechism,</HI> or, such as border upon, and may be easily deduced from <HI>the same,</HI>, and if there be need of it, <HI>help them</HI> to an Answer.—And for your Encouragement and Quickening, remem∣ber, that the <HI>sooner</HI> your <HI>Children</HI> are acquain∣ted with, and do embrace the Principles of Religion, the more likely it is, that they will retain them, and the less Danger there will be, of their being led astray by evil Men, and <HI>Seducers</HI>—And furthermore, not only, catechise them yourselves, but also, oblige them to attend <HI>ministerial</HI> Catechising, at the appointed Seasons for it—And I would just suggest to you, that it is a very proper Thing, not only for Ministers, but also for Parents, Masters and Mistresses, to put <HI>Children</HI> frequently in Mind, of that so∣lemn Dedication, which has been made of them, in their <HI>Baptism,</HI> unto the glorious <HI>Trinity</HI>; and to endeavour, that they may, <HI>betimes,</HI> understand, and comply with, the Design and Intent of it Show them, that they are laid under <HI>Engagements</HI> to be the <HI>Lord's</HI>; and that, if they <HI>answer</HI> those En∣gagements, <HI>then,</HI> they may expect that <HI>God</HI> will confer upon them all the <HI>Blessings</HI> of Goodness; but <HI>otherwise not</HI> — And I would, moreover, recommend it to you, as a Thing highly <HI>necessary, viz.</HI> To set before
<PB N="92" REF="004413_0052_100D2FF115EC1B38"/>
them the <HI>Evil</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> in general, in that, it is committed against the infinite and eter∣nal GOD, who is <HI>their</HI> Creator, and Benefac∣tor: And, in particular, to discover to them the Corruption of Nature, and how that <HI>they</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> prone to Evil, and are averse to that which is good, and unable, of them∣selves, to do any Thing, which may be ac∣ceptable unto the most High; and that <HI>they,</HI> therefore, do stand in <HI>absolute need</HI> of <HI>such</HI> an one for their <HI>Saviour,</HI> on whom they <HI>may</HI> safely rely and depend, both for Strength and Righteousness.—And then, proceed to display before them, the unparallel'd <HI>Excellencies</HI> of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and to shew them, that he is both <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> in <HI>one</HI> Person; and also, what the <HI>Offices</HI> are, which he executes, as our Redeemer; and that <HI>they</HI> must, of necessity, <HI>close</HI> with him, in <HI>all</HI> those Offices; and must give all Diligence, that so, <HI>they</HI> may be found wal∣king in <HI>all</HI> his Ordinances and Command∣ments blameless.—.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Charge them to do well.</HI></P>
<P>Not only, show 'em their Duty, with Respect to God, their Parents, Magistrates, Ministers, their Neighbours, and one another; but moreover, <HI>command them</HI> to keep the Way of the Lord.—Labour, all you can, to prevent their <HI>speaking,</HI> either foul or idle Words; as also, their <HI>doing</HI> any evil Deeds; and for this Reason, suffer them not to <HI>keep C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpany</HI> with <HI>such Children,</HI> as are <HI>addicted</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="004413_0052_100D2FF115EC1B38"/>
to <HI>use bad Language,</HI> lest they learn their Way, and so get a Snare to their Souls. Give them all necessary Counsel, Caution, and Reproof▪ Set before them the Promises and Threatnings of God's holy Word: The <HI>Threatnings</HI> to prevent their going astray from their Duty; and the <HI>Promises,</HI> to ani∣mate and encourage them to do well; and so, as it were, <HI>constrain</HI> them to be Follow∣ers of God, <HI>as dear Children.</HI>—Moreover, it may be very proper for you, to let them know, what they may expect as <HI>a Reward from you,</HI> if they do well; and also, what by Way of <HI>Punishment,</HI> if they refuse to be obedient.—And if Counsels, Reproofs, Promises, and Threatnings, do not avail, then, you <HI>must</HI> proceed to <HI>correct</HI> them; but labour to do it in the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and with an Eye to him, to make the Rod of Correction, a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an of Reformation. But then, I would further add, that if they <HI>do</HI> accept of your Counsel, and need not the Rod, let them see and know, that you ob∣serve it, and <HI>do not withold</HI> the promised Reward, but rather <HI>add</HI> to it, than diminish ought of it; for verily, it is much more eligible to draw, than to drive them, to their Duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Set a good Example before them</HI>: For, otherwise, all your Labour and Pains will, probably, be lost.</P>
<P>Precepts teach, but Examples move. We are all of us inclin'd to imitate those, whom we converse with, and especially, those with
<PB N="94" REF="004413_0053_100D2FF2C255A030"/>
whom we dwell, and who have the Charge over us.—In Consideration of which, I say it highly concerns all Superiors, to set a good Example before their Inferiors; and above all, Heads of Families should do so. And agreably, the holy <HI>Psalmist</HI> took up this Resolution, in Psal. 101.2 <HI>I will behave my self wisely in a perfect Way; — I will walk within my House with a perfect Heart.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Pray with and for them.</HI></P>
<P>Not only, pray in secret, but keep up <HI>Family</HI> Prayer, as you would escape the Curse, and obtain the Blessing of Heaven. —Also, oblige your <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> constantly to give their <HI>diligent Attendance.</HI> And let them learn, by your Example, to be serious and devout in the Worship of God. And let them know <HI>what you mean</HI> by your Family Service, namely, that you intend thereby to pay Homage to him, who is both <HI>your</HI> and <HI>their</HI> great <HI>Creator,</HI> and boun∣tiful <HI>Benefactor.</HI> Inform them, as well as you can, of his Greatness, and also of his Holiness, and his Omniscience; and let them know from you, that <HI>they</HI> must both love him, and fear before him. Put them in mind, once and again, that the all seeing <HI>Eye</HI> of the glorious <HI>God</HI> is continually <HI>upon them,</HI> and that, therefore, they must take Care to <HI>please</HI> him, at all Times; and in a peculiar Manner, must be serious in his <HI>im∣mediate Service,</HI> whether in publick private, or secret.—And moreover you must <HI>watch</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="004413_0053_100D2FF2C255A030"/>
over them on every <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> and take care, as much as is possible, that they sanc∣tify the same, not only at Home, but also at Meeting, and between Meetings; and so, as they come unto, and return from the House of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Teach and exhort them to pray for themselves.</HI></P>
<P>As they come to Years of Understanding, let them know, that it is both their Duty, and will be for their Interest, <HI>to pray</HI>; and that it will be <HI>highly pleasing</HI> to the LORD JESUS, to <HI>behold them, every Morning</HI> and <HI>Evening,</HI> on <HI>their Knees,</HI> in <HI>secret</HI>; as ap∣pears by that Word of Encouragement upon Reccord, in Prov. 8.17. <HI>I love them that love me, and they that seek me early shall find me.</HI> And that also in <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.6.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>put Words</HI> into <HI>their Mouths,</HI> and <HI>teach them how to pray</HI>: Thus, mind them of their <HI>Sins</HI> original and actual, and that they must both confess and bewail the same before the Lord, and humbly intreat him to pardon them, on <HI>Christ's</HI> Account. —Also inform them of their <HI>need</HI> of <HI>re∣newing Grace,</HI> being Enemies to God in their Hearts, and that they must earnestly beg of God to create them anew in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and to <HI>enable</HI> them to <HI>do</HI> the Duties incum∣bent upon them, towards God, their Pa∣rents, one another, and all whom they may converse with, or become related unto. —Moreover, teach them to pray for <HI>daily
<PB N="96" REF="004413_0054_100D5061D27A3598"/>
Protection</HI> and <HI>Provision</HI>; but especially, that they may be kept in the <HI>Fear</HI> of the <HI>Lord,</HI> all the Day long, and be delivered from the <HI>Wrath to come,</HI> and finally <HI>received to Glory.</HI>—And fail not to labour to im∣press upon their Minds, the absolute Neces∣sity of their praying for these Things, and whatsoever else they stand in need of, in the <HI>Name,</HI> or for the <HI>Sake</HI> of our LORD JESUS CHRIST: As also, that they may not omit to <HI>give Thanks for</HI> CHRIST, and for those innumerable and undeserv'd <HI>Favours,</HI> which, thro' him, they are made the Sub∣jects of.</P>
<P>Thus, I say, Pains should be taken with <HI>Children,</HI> to lead them to CHRIST; and you may not suffer any Thing to divert you from it.—<HI>Those Children</HI> spoken of in my <HI>Text,</HI> without doubt, <HI>heard some others</HI> make use of <HI>these Words,</HI> before they them∣selves cryed in the Temple, <HI>Hosanna to the Son of David:</HI> And, in like Manner, <HI>Chil∣dren now-a-Days,</HI> must be taught the <HI>Way</HI> in which they ought to go, and the <HI>Words</HI> which they ought to speak, <HI>especially,</HI> in their <HI>Addresses to the Throne of Grace.</HI>—</P>
<P>But now,</P>
<P>Lest <HI>some</HI> Parents should be <HI>defective</HI> in <HI>this</HI> Article of their Duty, it is tho't best to transcribe a <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> (written by <HI>M. H.</HI>) for the <HI>use</HI> of <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P>Not with a Design <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o confine them to a Form, but, that having such an Help before
<PB N="97" REF="004413_0054_100D5061D27A3598"/>

<P>It is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>O God, thou art my God, <HI>early</HI> will I seek thee.</P>

<P>Who is a God like unto thee, glorious in Holiness, fearful in Praises, doing Wonders?</P>
<P>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I may desire in Comparison with thee. When my Flesh and my Heart fail, thou art the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion forever.</P>
<P>Thou madest me for thyself, to shew forth thy Praise.</P>
<P>But I am a Sinner; I was shapen in Ini∣quity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</P>
<P>O God, be merciful to me a Sinner.</P>
<P>O deliver me from the Wrath to come thro' Jesus Christ, who dyed for me, and rose again.</P>
<P>Lord, give me a new Nature. Let Jesus Christ be formed in my Soul, that to me to live may be Christ, and to dye may be Gain.</P>
<P>Lord, I was in my Baptism given up to thee; receive me graciously, and love me freely.</P>
<P>Lord Jesus, thou hast encouraged <HI>little Children</HI> to come to thee, and hast said, that

of such is the Kingdom of God; I come to thee; O make me a faithful Subject of thy Kingdom, take me up in thy Arms, put thy Hands upon me, and bless me.</P>
<P>O give me Grace to redeem me from all Iniquity, and particularly, from the Vanities which <HI>Childhood</HI> and <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth</HI> is subject to</P>
<P>Lord, give me a wise and an understan∣ding Heart, that I may know and do thy Will in every thing, and may in nothing sin against thee.</P>
<P>Lord, grant that <HI>from my Childhood</HI> I may know the holy Scriptures, and may continue in the good Things that I have learned.</P>
<P>Remove from me the way of lying, and grant me thy Law graciously</P>
<P>Lord, be thou <HI>a Father to me</HI>; teach me, and guide me; provide for me, and protect me; and bless me, even me, O my Father.</P>
<P>Bless all my Relations [Father, Mother, Brothers, Sisters,] and give me Grace to do my Duty to them in every Thing.</P>
<P>Lord, prepare me for Death, and give me wisely to consider my latter End.</P>
<P>O Lord, <HI>I thank thee</HI> for all thy Mercies to me; for Life and Health, Food and Rai∣ment, and for my Education; for my Cre∣ation, Preservation, and all the Blessings of this Life; but above all, for thine inesti∣mable Love, in the Redemption of the World by our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> for the Means of Grace, and the Hopes of Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="004413_0055_100D5064A67615A8"/>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable Gift: Blessed be God for JESUS CHRIST. None but Christ, none but Christ <HI>for me,</HI> in whose Name alone, I offer up this <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI> unto God in the Heavens.</P>
<P>Now to God, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, that great Name into which I was baptiz'd, be Honour, and Glory, Domi∣nion, and Praise, for ever and ever, AMEN.</P>
