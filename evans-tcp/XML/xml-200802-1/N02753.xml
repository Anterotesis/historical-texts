<HEAD>To the Old or first gather'd CHURCH in BOSTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Christian Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A<HI>S I have often review'd with Wonder, so I take Leave on the present Occasion thus publickly to men∣tion with Gratitude, the signal Conduct of Divine Providence in bringing me at first among you, while I was in a manner an utter</HI> Stranger <HI>to you all, and when by reason of my young Years, and apprehended</HI> Unfit∣ness <HI>for so important a Station, I could not entertain the least Expectation of such a Preferment. And the uncommon</HI> Una∣nimity <HI>that (as you may remember) attended your Invita∣tion and Call, was what I have thought a very happy Circumstance of my Settlement, and do often look back upon with equal Pleasure and Surprize. This indeed was one peculiar Encouragement I had to give up</HI> my own <HI>Inclina∣tions, which were not to fix in the Ministry so very early.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have Reason to admire your Candour toward me, while I have been with many Infirmities serving in the Gospel among you: And I desire to take a thankful Notice of the Favour of God in continuing us together thus long in so much of mutual peace and Satisfaction; now the</HI> 14<HI>th Year</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Feb. 1716, 17. By Vote of the Church I enter'd on stated Preaching.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>I have sometimes very anxious Thoughts of Heart upon that of the Apostle,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 2. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago.—<HI>Happy the Minister, happy the Professor, that hath such Assurance of his saving Union to Christ! And happy the People, who have those to testify the Gospel of the Grace of God among them, who are vitally united to Christ, and</HI> have the Witness in themselves!</P>
<P>IT <HI>has always been very affecting to me to consider what</HI> Men of God <HI>they were, in whose place I succeed. This Church of Christ has been distinguish'd with a Succession of burning and shining Lights; Pastors and Teachers eminent for their Gifts, and no less eminent for their Graces and Experience in all the Mysteries of the Divine Life;</HI> Wilson, Cotton, Norton, Davenport, <HI>&amp;c. These
<PB REF="003280_0004_0FF03C7C69393CE8"/>
Venerable Fathers were in their Day very much</HI> New-England'<HI>s Strength and Glory; and in each of them this Church enjoy'd a peculiar Treasure. I have often blush'd and been full of Confusion within my self, from a Consci∣ousness of my own comparative Nothingness: Yet I hope the Reflection has sometimes been a Help to me in my Work, to direct and animate my Ministrations among you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have taken a singular Delight in reading the</HI> Lives <HI>of my excellent Predecessors; so many of which we see in Print: have often thought I cou'd desire no better Patterns to copy after; and made it my Heart's Desire and Prayer to God, That I might by the Grace of Christ be principl'd and spirit∣ed, as they were; that I might have the like Presence of Christ with me, as they had; that the Work they so happily began, might not miscarry in my hands.</HI></P>
<P>ALAS! <HI>there is among us a visible</HI> Decline <HI>of Religion in the power and practice of it, and not the ancient Success of Gospel-Ordinances. Sure I am, It becomes us all, both Ministers and People, humbly to inquire into the Grounds and Causes hereof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I readily take to my self</HI> my <HI>part of the Blame, as being sadly sensible of many Defects in me, with regard both to those Abilities and Graces, which form the Character, and direct the wise and holy Management, that is necessary in those that wou'd by their Example, as well as Preaching, win Souls to Christ, and</HI> lead the Way <HI>in seeking the Kingdom of Heaven. Verily the best of us all need mer∣ciful Allowances, before we can claim the Character and Reward of good and faithful Servants of Jesus Christ. O for the Application of the Blood of Sprinkling, that I may be made accepted in the</HI> BELOVED! <HI>And for the Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, that I may watch in all things and make full Proof of my Ministry! I earnestly ask the Help of your fervent Prayers for me (as also for my worthy Brother and Collegue) that the Sins of my Ministry may be done away by the Blood of Christ, and that the Success of it may be secured by his powerful Blessing: that Christ our Master may be with us continually, in the Study and in the Pulpit, and in all our Conversation, Visits, and pri∣vate Labours among you.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>we beseech you (Brethren) in the fear of God to consider what Defects there are on</HI> your <HI>part, that may be a further Obstruction to the Success of the Gospel in this once flourishing Church. "Let your Ministers have their
<PB REF="003280_0005_0FF03C7E28F90768"/>
just Share of Censure: Nevertheless we are persuaded, you do not think the whole Blame lies at our Doors. Even the</HI> SON <HI>of</HI> GOD <HI>himself, of whom it was witnessed, That</HI> never man spake <HI>or liv'd</HI> like him; <HI>yet meets with little Success, and finds himself constrained to throw back Men's just Condemnation on their own Heads,</HI> Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life".</P>
<P>BE <HI>much in serious Self-Examination, to know what on your part hinders the Gospel; and be much in Prayer, and in the Use of all proper Methods, that the Power of Godliness may be revived among us. Let Gospel-Truths, Gospel Order, and Gospel-Worship be precious in your Eyes. Stand fast in the Liberty, wherewith Christ hath made you free: and keep the Ordinances as they have been delivered to you, in their primitive Purity, without suffering any Alloy of hu∣man Inventions. If some from an Antichristian Spirit wou'd impose upon you in Matters of Religion, remember these are sacred to God and Conscience; and</HI> be not the Servants of Men. <HI>As we are a spiritual Corporation, let us take Care to exercise and reverence the holy Discipline that Christ hath instituted; Charitable to receive all visible Saints, cautious to admit only such, and faithful to expel scandalous Sinners from our Communion. Purge out the old Leaven, that ye may be a new Lump. O let the Duty of Brotherly Admonition, so much neglected in this Day of Degeneracy, be restored to a serious and universal Practice; and yet let none, under a specious pretence of lamenting others Sins, act the</HI> Busy-Body, <HI>as the manner of some is, whisper∣ing Things which they ought not, to the prejudice of their Neighbours Reputation, the great Hurt of Religion, and the manifest Forfeiture of all Pretensions to a Spirit of Cha∣rity and Brotherly Kindness. Watch over one another, for good, and not Evil. Provoke one another to Love and good Works. Exhort one another daily, left any of you be hard∣ned through the Deceitfulness of Sin. Be not Partakers of other Men's Sins: but by bearing due Testimony against them, deliver your own Souls. Such as are Heads of Fa∣milies, O take a religious Care of the Youth committed to your Charge: And Children, see that you obey your Pa∣rents in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>IT'<HI>s a day abounding with Temptations, to our young People in special, to desert the Interest of pure Religion, and betray the Cause of God, in which our Forefathers were engag'd. O let us do all we can to fortify and fix
<PB REF="003280_0006_0FF03C800A552058"/>
them, and to recover such as are fallen from their Stedfastness. What greater Joy than to see our Children walking in the Truth! Let us labour their early Conversion to God, and use all possible Means to form them to Virtue, to fur∣nish and dispose them to be active Blessings to their Generation. And thou</HI> Solomon, <HI>my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, &amp; serve him with a perfect Heart &amp; with a willing Mind: for the Lord searcheth all Hearts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, tremble lest be cast thee off for ever.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>a word, let us glorify God for his signal Appearances in the days of our Forefathers; and consider them as Obli∣gations on us, who reap the happy fruits thereof, to adhere with Steadiness and Zeal to the spiritual and exalted</HI> Ends <HI>of that great Undertaking, which brought them over to</HI> America. <HI>Let us always maintain a peculiar Esteem for the Memory of our pious Progenitors, and train up our Children in the same Veneration: be often telling them of the excellent Character and Spirit of our Forefathers, their Errand into this Wilderness, the Covenant wherein they've bound their Posterity to the Lord, and their many ardent Prayers for succeeding Generations. As we are building on the Foundations they have laid for us, and rejoycing in many desirable Results of their Pains and Prayers, surely it be∣comes us never to mention their Names but with Distinctions of Respect, as the Fathers of</HI> New-England. <HI>And let us see to it that we act and behave worthily of our noble Descent: Else this will turn for a Testimony against us.</HI></P>
<P>STAND <HI>ye in the Ways, and see, and ask for the old 'Paths, the good Way, and walk therein: and ye shall find Rest for your Souls Remember them that have had the Rule over you, who have spoken to you the good Word of God. And be ye Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI> promote these excellent Purposes, is my Aim in the following Discourse: which I now put into your Hand for your serious Perusal, and commend to the Blessing of</HI> GOD <HI>for the desired Success. Unto</HI> WHOM <HI>be Glory from you, &amp; in all the Churches of the Saints, by Christ Jesus, World without end! 'Tis the affectionate Wish of,</HI></P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE Historical and Practical ON THE Beginning of New-England &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTH. XIII. 31, 32.</BIBL>
<Q><P>Another Parable put he forth unto them, saying, <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is like to a Grain of Mustard-Seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a Tree: so that the Birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE may very fitly intitle the Chapter before us a Collection of Parables. No less than eight are here record∣ed; where, in Language borrow'd from Things earthly, our Saviour discourses of Matters spiritual and heavenly. This way of teaching by Similitudes
<PB REF="003280_0008_0FF03C848100D600"/>
was what the <HI>Jews</HI> had always been accustom'd to: and our Lord in the use of this Method condescend∣ed to the Capacity and Genius of the People of that day. His Parables are all the most wisely chosen, to serve their respective purposes. 'Tis both plea∣sant and profitable to meditate upon them.</P>
<P>THE scope of this Parable of the <HI>Grain of Mustard-Seed</HI> is to shew how the Gospel-Church (to which the Stile of <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven</HI> is here and often elsewhere given) should from very low and small Beginnings, gradually increase and grow, and at length rise up to an admirable Degree of Strength, Extent and Glory.</P>
<P>THE Text wou'd naturally lead me to dis∣course of the State of <HI>Christianity</HI> in the Aposto∣lick Age; <Q>which appear'd at first as a little inconsiderable <HI>Seed,</HI> but did soon sho<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up, and grow into a stately <HI>Tree;</HI> did like the Tree of Life in the midst of the Garden of God, spread its salutary Branches far and wide, &amp; has taken so deep and firm a Root, that all the Powers of Hell, with all their Storms and Underminings, shall never be able to prevail against it.</Q>—But tho' such a Discourse might be of excellent Service, it's out of the way of my <HI>present Design;</HI> which is to bring your Reflections nearer home, and employ them in a brief Recognition of the Primitive State, Beginning and Progress of the Kingdom of Christ in <HI>this place.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT determin'd my Thoughts to such a Sub∣ject, was a View to that observable Circumstance of the Week now opening to us, That it is the Period of <HI>One HUNDRED</HI> Years since the first Gather∣ing of this ancient, <HI>Church,</HI> and laying the Founda∣tions of Gospel-Order here, by a solemn <HI>Covenant;</HI>

<P>Now as it has fallen out in the Course of our publick reading the Scriptures, that so sutable a Text shou'd occur for the present Occasion, I have been ready to interpret this as an Intimation of Pro∣vidence to me, to take some special Notice of the remarkable Period before us, and lead you into some Meditations adapted thereto. The Language of Heaven to us at this day seems to be as in Isa. 51. 1, 2. <HI>Hearken to me, ye that follow after righte∣ousness, ye that seek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged. Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you; for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.</HI> And when I reflect seriously on the Wonder-working Providence of God, which planted our <HI>Zion</HI> and has establish'd it hitherto, I have thought She might very fitly take up the Language of Psal. 40th.—<HI>He brought me
<PB N="4" REF="003280_0010_0FF03C8866BA2F40"/>
up out of an horrible Pit, and set my Feet upon a Rock: and he hath put a new Song in my Mouth.—Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful Works which thou hast done, and thy Thoughts to us-ward, they cannot be reckoned up in Order unto thee; if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be number'd.</HI> A Train of marvellous Operations of Divine Power and Grace prepar'd the Way to the Plantation of the Kingdom of GOD in this place; and a Succession of illustrious Events attended the Progress thereof. <HI>O sing unto the Lord a new Song: He hath made known his salvation; his Righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the Heathen: all the Ends of the Earth have seen the Salvation of our GOD. One Generation shall praise thy Works to another: I will speak of the Glory of thy Kingdom, and declare thy loving kindness, O God, in the midst of thy Temple. Thy Saints shall bless thee; they shall abundantly utter the Memory of thy great Goodness, and sing aloud of thy Righteousness. My Mouth shall speak the Praise of the Lord: and let all Flesh bless his holy Name for ever.</HI></P>
<P>I will not pretend to critically trace the Begin∣ning and Improvement of this Work of GOD in all its several steps; for that were to write a Volume of History: But shall only give you the more gene∣ral Hints, proper to have place in a Sermon, to the End I may excite your Gratitude and encourage your Confidence toward GOD, the Hope of our Fa∣thers.</P>
<P>OUR Text points out the Method I propose to my self in treating this Subject, which is—</P>
<P N="1">1. To call your Thoughts back to the <HI>Original</HI> of this religious Settlement, and shew the <HI>Smallness</HI> of our Beginning.</P>
<P N="2">2. To consider the <HI>Means</HI> of its Progress and Establishment.</P>
<P N="3">3. MENTION the extraordinary <HI>Degree</HI> of its Growth, Strength, and Usefulness.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003280_0011_0FF03C8AB0FE4450"/>
LIKE a Grain of <HI>Mustard-Seed,</HI> it made but a con∣temptible and unpromising Figure at first: but af∣terward it strangely came on, improv'd &amp; flourish'd, until at length it became as a <HI>Tree,</HI> in whose extend∣ed Branches the Fowl of the Air seek for Shade and Repose.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>I shall say something as to the Rise and</HI> Occasion <HI>of this religious Settlement, and make some remarks on the smallness of our Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>IT rose from little and improbable Beginnings. Tho' afterwards it grew up to a considerable Tall∣ness, it was in its first Principle but fitly resembled by <HI>a Grain of Mustard-Seed,</HI> one of the smallest sort of Seeds.</P>
<P>IN order to search out the first Springs, and <HI>Root</HI> of this Plant of the Lord, it may be of Use to pre∣mise the following historical Observations.</P>
<P>ABOUT two hundred Years since, began the Pro∣testant <HI>Reformation;</HI> when after a long Night of Popish Darkness GOD caused the Light of the glori∣ous Gospel to break forth in many parts of the Chris∣tian World, overspread with thick Clouds of Igno∣rance, Heresy, and false Worship. Several Coun∣tries, mov'd by the Spirit of GOD, nobly attempted to throw off the yoke of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> and deliver themselves from the Superstitions and Tyrannies of the <HI>Romish</HI> Hierarchy.</P>
<P>BY the grace of GOD such Prosperity attended those glorious Attempts, that in a few years the Re∣formation made its progress thro' a great part of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> About the year 1526 several States in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> that were zealous for the reforming Interest, united in a <HI>Protestation</HI> against the Decrees of a Po∣pish Diet; and upon that account the Reformers have ever since gone under the Name of <HI>Protestants.</HI></P>
<P>"GERMANY took Fire from <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Me∣lancton: Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Geneva</HI> from <HI>Zuinglius</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="003280_0012_0FF03C8D376463B0"/>
and <HI>Calvin.</HI> And after them follow'd <HI>England</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, under the Di∣rection of <HI>Cranmer, Latimer,</HI> and <HI>Ridley.</HI>—The writings, that defended the Necessity of a Reforma∣tion in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> were greedily embrac'd; the Corruption in Doctrine &amp; Worship became in∣telligible; and the Corruption of Manners, crept into all the spiritual Orders, becoming scandalous, not one of them had Interest to stop the Reforma∣tion"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bennet's <HI>Historical account of the several Attempts for a further Reformation.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS the Reformation was not in all places carry'd on with equal Zeal, nor to the same degree of Perfection. Things were prosecuted to a greater length in some places than others, according to the variety of <HI>Motives,</HI> that influenc'd Men in their opposition to Popery.</P>
<P>THE case of the <HI>English</HI> Church had something very peculiar in it. For our first Reformers were acted by Principles vastly different.</P>
<P>ONE Set of Men were govern'd by <HI>Political Views</HI> &amp; sinister Considerations. Many were Papists in <HI>Disguise,</HI> "who (as one expresses it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pref. to Abridgment of Bp. <HI>Burnet'</HI>s 3d. Vol. <HI>Mist. Reformation</HI></NOTE>) when they cou'd no longer resist the prevailing force of the Reformation, conform'd to it in Appearance, still retaining the <HI>Old Leaven:</HI> and these, if they cou'd not retain the substance of Popery, yet endeavour'd to preserve as much as possible of the outward Face and Ap∣pearance of it; that so a Return might be the more easy, and seem the more natural"—Others there were, who tho' it was a Joy to them for reasons of a political Nature, to behold the Power of the See of <HI>Rome</HI> broken, and the Pope discarded; yet, ha∣ving, by the Impressions of an Education in the midst of Popish Superstitions, a strong Gust for Ceremonies, and Love of Pomp in Worship, were strenuous Ad∣vocates
<PB N="7" REF="003280_0013_0FF03C8F964ED0C0"/>
for the continuance of many of those ancient Rites &amp; Customs, they were bred up in the Observa∣tion of: they hoped by this to recommend themselves to the esteem of <HI>Papists,</HI> and thought it a most pro∣bable Method to make an easy Conquest of them, to remove their Prejudices, and bring over Multitudes of them to a Compliance with the Reformation.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, (as an <HI>Episcopal</HI> writer observes<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burnet,</HI> ubi supra</NOTE>) "Many at that day were for complying with the Laws, &amp; bearing with several things which they did not approve of, in hopes of getting them afterwards amended.—Influenc'd by false Notions of Policy, this Circumstance of Affairs (he adds) kept them from reforming many things which they <HI>dislik'd,</HI> and also (no doubt) from examining more thro'ly into several other things"—</P>
<P>'TIS a very good Paragraph that follows, which I beg leave to digress so far as to re∣peat to you, from the same Hand,—"Cer∣tainly (says he) <HI>our</HI> Reformation, as happy as we are in what we enjoy of it, was never yet perfected; nor ever can be till we all come openly to <HI>acknowledge,</HI> and to <HI>act</HI> consistently with, that <HI>Principle,</HI> which was the only Ground upon which the Reformation did, or could, stand; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That <HI>the Scriptures are the only Rule of Faith to Christians;</HI> and that every Christian, as he is <HI>to answer to GOD</HI> for his own Actions, and not others for him, so is he to <HI>judge for himself,</HI> how he is to act in matters of Religion, and not others to judge for him. Where <HI>this</HI> Principle does not prevail, there (says he) <HI>Papery</HI> still remains, tho' it pass under the name of <HI>Protestantism:</HI> And till this Principle does prevail, we can expect no <HI>Completion</HI> of that Reformation, which as yet can only be said to have been happily <HI>begun</HI> amongst US".</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003280_0014_0FF03C91E0A1F548"/>
I come now to observe, There was in the very Infancy of the Reformation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"In an ancient Book call'd <HI>The Register of memorable Matters touching Reformation</HI> (mention'd by Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> in his <HI>Way of Congregational Churches cleared</HI>) there is a Story of <HI>an hundred</HI> Persons, who refused the common Liturgy, and the Congrega∣tions attending thereunto, and used Prayers and Preachings &amp;. Sacraments among themselves; whereof 14 or 15 were sent to Prison. And these pleaded their Separation before the Lord∣Mayor, Bishop <HI>Sands,</HI> and other Commissioners on <HI>June</HI> 20, in the year 1567.</NOTE> <HI>another Set</HI> of Men, who were engag'd in the Cause sincerely upon that <HI>great Principle,</HI> and consider'd things not in a Political View, but a <HI>Scriptural.</HI> They appeal'd <HI>to the Law and to the Testimony:</HI> making that their sollicitous Inquiry, <HI>What saith the Scripture?</HI> They pleaded for the inspir'd Writings as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e alone Stan∣dard of Truth in Divine things, and profess'd to bring every Opinion and Custom to the Test of the HOLY BIBLE. They renounc'd all implicit Credit to human Teachers, and all human Imposi∣tions in matters of Religion and Divine Worship. They asserted the Sovereignty of the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as the sole Lord of Conscience; and took his written Word for the only Canon of their Faith and Practice.</P>
<P>THEY were Enemies to Magnificence and Osten∣tation in Worship, &amp; to coercive Power &amp; Tyranny in Discipline; as things the Scriptures were abso∣lute strangers to. "They remembred how these things had minister'd to the Corruptions, the Super∣stitions, and Enormities of Popery: and they tho't it best, in conformity to the laudable Example of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> who brake in pieces the <HI>brazen Serpent</HI> (tho' of divine Appointment) when the People <HI>abus'd</HI> it to Idolatry, to lay aside human Inventions which had been so abus'd". They thought it the Wisdom of <HI>Protestants,</HI> their Duty and Safety, to reduce every Circumstance of Discipline &amp; Worship
<PB N="9" REF="003280_0015_0FF03C9437105428"/>
as nigh as possible to their profess'd <HI>Rule;</HI> to avoid all Resemblances of <HI>Popery</HI> as much as might be, and so settle the widest Distance between <HI>Protestant</HI> and <HI>Papal</HI> Churches; which wou'd be a happy Method to clog any future attempts of a Return to <HI>Romish</HI> Fopperies and Usurpations.</P>
<P>BESIDES, in the beginning of the Reign of the Popish Queen <HI>Mary</HI> (so irrecoverably devoted to that cruel Church, which has been often drunk with the Blood of the Saints) when they foresaw a furious storm of Persecution coming on, many of the Re∣formers fled abroad for Safety, and having Oppor∣tunity to observe the Worship and Discipline of the <HI>foreign</HI> Protestant Churches, they were (not a few of them) <HI>pleas'd</HI> with their Practice; who, they thought, had gone the furthest in reviving of pri∣mitive Christianity, and restoring the Order of the Gospel. And hence, after their Return home, at the happy Accession of the Protestant Queen ELISA∣BETH, which made another Revolution in Religion, and gave new Life to the <HI>Protestant</HI> Cause, those Men retaining a delightful Remembrance of what they had seen in the reform'd Churches abroad, &amp; judg∣ing it more subservient to the Interest of true Christi∣anity, to study a Harmony with the foreign Protes∣tants, in Worship &amp; Discipline, as well as in Doctrine, than to Symbolize with their avow'd Adversaries, the idolatrous Papists; they became zealous Con∣tenders for a more perfect Reformation in the Church of <HI>England:</HI> advancing and urging those three great Principles, The Limitation of <HI>Church Power</HI> to Matters of <HI>Divine Commandment,</HI> the Li∣mitation of <HI>Bishops</HI> to a <HI>particular</HI> Congregation, and the Limitation of <HI>Church-Fellowship</HI> to visible <HI>Saints.</HI> They were for having the Rule of Christianity to be the Rule of Conformity. This is the Party, who were at first distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>Puritans;</HI> afterwards by that of <HI>Nonconformists</HI> or <HI>Disciplina∣rians,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="003280_0016_0FF03C9680BBD9D8"/>
and now usually of <HI>Presbyterians</HI> or <HI>Dissen∣ters;</HI> the Glory of the English Reformation.</P>
<P>THESE good Men, tho' dissatisfy'd at the imper∣fect Constitution of things, yet considering the Ne∣cessity of the Times, in the beginning, labour'd to suppress their Resentments and Complaints as much as possible for the present, and tarry'd in the Com∣munion of the establish'd Church many of them; waiting for better Days, and encouraging a Hope that the Reformation might proceed in due time unto greater Purity. But (as One observes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> in his <HI>Eleutheria,</HI> or History of the Refor∣mation and of Nonconformity.</NOTE>) they that found their secular Interests accommodated in that Constitution, employ'd the Power which they had in their hands, not only to retard the progress of the Reformation, but even with innumerable Vexations to harass such as were the most zealous Friends unto it; to <HI>censure, fine, silence, deprive,</HI> and <HI>imprison</HI> those that were dissatisfy'd and cou'd not conform, being (as is most remarkable) Men for the most part <HI>of the same Spirit and Principle</HI> with those Protestants, who suffer'd under the Prelates in Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Day. For a considerable time these persecuted Puritans remain'd very much in Privacy under their Sufferings, waiting still for more of Reformation, or for more of Liberty and Indul∣gence to conscientious Dissenters. But after some years of fruitless Expectation, Severities being mul∣tiply'd upon them, and the increasing Tyranny of the Ecclesiastical Courts destroying all Hope of a religious Pacification, it drove many to a more open <HI>Separation</HI> from the Things that were by Law esta∣blish'd.</P>
<P>A noble Army of <HI>Confessors</HI> (martyr'd with scan∣dal and oppression, and not able to live in Quiet at home) being conducted by that <HI>Wisdom, which is
<PB N="11" REF="003280_0017_0FF03C98D2708CF0"/>
first pure, then peaceable,</HI> left their native Country, and sought Rest to their Souls abroad. Some re∣tir'd into various parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and found Com∣fort in the Bosom of foreign Churches.</P>
<P>OTHERS sought a Refuge and Covert from the Storm in some quiet Recess of the NEW WORLD. Here they hoped still to enjoy the Freedoms and Privileges of <HI>English</HI> Government, and to enlarge the British Dominions: Here they hoped to be the blessed Instruments of spreading the Gospel of Christ among the heathen <HI>Natives:</HI> Here they hop'd to prosecute the Design of a <HI>Scriptural</HI> Reformation, ac∣cording to the Example of the best reform'd parts of the Protestant World, to form Churches truly evan∣gelical, and to enjoy the spiritual Liberties &amp; Bles∣sings of the purest Church-State under a faithful Ministry. In a word, here they hop'd they should be out of the <HI>Reach</HI> of Persecution, or that their angry Brethren would be <HI>asham'd</HI> to pursue them in their distant Retreats; and that they shou'd en∣tail pure Religion, with Liberty of Conscience, as the goodliest Heritage, unto their <HI>Children</HI> in suc∣ceeding Generations.</P>
<P>UPON such excellent Views, our pious <HI>Ancestors</HI> transplanted themselves, Families, and Estates into these remote Regions of <HI>NEW-ENGLAND</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>This Land had beeen for some years known by the Name of the <HI>Northern Plantation,</HI> until King <HI>Charles</HI> the first (then Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>) gave it the Name of <HI>NEW-ENG∣LAND.</HI></Q> <BIBL><HI>Dr.</HI> I.

<P><PB N="12" REF="003280_0018_0FF03C9A5660E990"/>
EARLY in the year 1629, arriv'd at <HI>Salem,</HI> the original Settlers of that part of the Country; who soon prosecuted their great Intention, in the Voyage, by entring into the Church-State of the Gospel, and planting a reformed Congregation in that most an∣cient Town of the <HI>Massachusets.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Summer of 1630. came over divers ho∣nourable Persons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Governour and Company of the <HI>Massachusets-Bay,</HI> which had hitherto resided in <HI>London,</HI> now remov'd to <HI>New-England,</HI> bringing with them the Patent or Charter of the Plantation.</NOTE>, Ministers, and worthy Christi∣ans: among whom were those Servants of Christ, that <HI>founded</HI> the Church-Society, of which <HI>we</HI> are the present Members, the most ancient Congrega∣tion in this Place.</P>
<P>THEY first embody'd into Church-Order at <HI>Charls∣town,</HI> under the pastoral Care of the famous old Mr. <HI>Wilson:</HI> But not liking their Situation so well, the greatest part (with their excellent Pastor) very quickly agreed to remove over on this side the Ri∣ver, and planted the Town of <HI>Boston:</HI> Those of the Church, who stay'd behind, still retaining their Relation to it, <Q>until <HI>Octob.</HI> 1632; when, those Members desiring a Dismission from the Congre∣gation to enter into a New Church-Body at <HI>Charlstown,</HI> and having first solemnly sought unto God, with the Rest of the Church, for Di∣rection herein, they were accordingly dismissed upon the 14th day of the said Month.</Q><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Old Church</HI> Records.</NOTE> And now upon this Separation, I find the Number of Males in the Church of <HI>Boston</HI> (after nigh two years continuance here, in which time doubtless Additions were made to it) amounted but to a∣bout 70 or 80: the Body of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>YOU see, from how minute an Origin hath risen this great and populous Town; which has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many worshipping Assemblies now belonging to it. It was
<PB N="13" REF="003280_0019_0FF03C9CA4A5F540"/>
truly at first a <HI>Day of small things</HI> with this People of the Lord, with the Country in general, and with this Town in particular.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Number,</HI> their Beginning was small, and so in general as to external <HI>Figure:</HI> which expos'd them to many Fears, and to the Insults of their Enemies; who were ready to mock these contemp∣tible <HI>New-Englanders,</HI> as <HI>Sanballat</HI> and <HI>Tobiah</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the <HI>Jews</HI> in old time, when attempting to rebui<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> The one said, <HI>What do these feeble</HI> Jews? <HI>Will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an End in a day?</HI> And the other said, <HI>Even that which they build, if a Fox go up, he shall even break down the Stone-wall.—</HI> Yea, <HI>Judah</HI> her∣self said, <HI>The Strength of the Bearers of Burdens is decay'd, and we are not able to build the wall.</HI> Neh. 4. 2, 3, 10.</P>
<P>IN like manner our Forefathers were a despis'd Handful of Men; look'd upon with Contempt by proud and haughty Scorners; and at the same time when the Adversary said, <HI>Let us cause the Work to cease,</HI> the Builders themselves almost sinking under the weight of many Discouragements, were ready to say, E'en let it fall, we are not able to go thorow with it. They were in a Wilderness-Condition; seeing nothing round them but uncultivated Wilds and savage Creatures; distant a thousand Leagues from their native Country, capable of being but little serv'd by foreign Amities, and for a while without any Vicinity of christian habitation among themselves; enduring various Hardships, Wants and Straights; meeting with sore Losses, grievous Sicknesses, many Deaths, and lamentable Bereave∣ments of some that seemed to be Pillars in the Church and Common-wealth.</P>
<P>INNUMERABLE Evils compassed them about: They were in perils on every side, in perils of Robbers, in perils by their own Countrymen, in perils of the
<PB N="14" REF="003280_0020_0FF03CA0A80BDC90"/>
Heathen, in perils by false Brethren, in perils in the Sea, and in perils in the Wilderness: in Weariness and Painfulness, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirst, in Fastings often, in Cold &amp; Nakedness.</P>
<P>THEY dearly purchas'd (with many Tears, Prayers, Mortifications &amp; Self-denials) those hap∣py Gospel-Privileges and religious Liberties, which too many among us at this day are so ready to make light of, and the <HI>Royal Charter</HI> for which was the grand Inducement to our Forefathers, to come o∣ver into this Wilderness and plant the same at their own Charge. They did not aim at a worldly, but spiritual Interest: Nor had they any temporal At∣tractives to bring them hither. They cou'd not come (as <HI>Israel</HI> of old into <HI>Canaan</HI>) with hopes to enter into other Men's Labours and build on Foun∣dations already laid. No! They came expecting, nei∣ther Cities and Houses prepar'd for their Reception, nor Gardens, Fields, and Orchards for their Enter∣tainment: but a great and terrible Wilderness, a Land of Deserts, and of Pits, and of the shadow of Death. Here they expected they must (like the Builders of <HI>Jerusalem</HI>) work with one hand, and hold a Weapon in the other; and looked to get their Bread not only with the Sweat of their Brows, but even with the Peril of their Lives. And it was not without indefatigable Application, much La∣bour, and great Expence, that they subdu'd this desert Land, for a Dwelling place and Inheritance.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed now</P>
<P>II. <HI>To make some Reflections on the</HI> Growth <HI>and</HI> Progress <HI>of this religious Settlement, and the</HI> Means <HI>thereof.</HI></P>
<P>THE little inconsiderable Seed, sown in this Place, quickly took Root, sprung up, and grew, increas'd and flourish'd, in an admirable and almost unex∣ampl'd manner.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003280_0021_0FF03CA244C71560"/>
THE <HI>Country</HI> flourish'd, under the Protection of the Royal Charter, a mild and equal Administration of civil Government, and the Smiles of Heaven, very remarkably; that scarce any History affords a Pa∣rallel.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Town</HI> filled very fast with People, and waxed rich, and made an eminent Figure among the Tribes of our Israel. A waste howling Wilderness became a pleasant Habitation, like the Garden of God, sa∣tisfy'd with Favour, and full with the Blessing of the Lord.</P>
<P>ALSO the <HI>Church</HI> here had added to it daily such as should be saved; Multitudes, both Men and Women. As it is said, Act. 6. 7. <HI>The Word of God increased, and the Number of the Disciples mul∣tiplied in</HI> Jerusalem <HI>greatly.</HI> And as it is said of the Church at <HI>Rome</HI> in its first days, Rom. 1. 8. <HI>Their Faith was spoken of throughout the whole World.</HI> In this Respect our Land might once be called the Glory of all Lands; this Town, the golden City, and this Church a fruitful Field, which the Lord hath blessed. Glorious Things have been spoken of thee, O City of GOD, Beautiful for Situation, the Joy of the whole Earth, and Heaven's Delight, as <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> of old.</P>
<P>AND now if the REASONS of their Prosperity and Growth be inquir'd into, it may be said,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE must resolve all into the gracious <HI>Presence</HI> of CHRIST with them, as the <HI>principal</HI> Cause, the fundamental Ground.</P>
<P>THE Presence of Christ with our Forefathers was the Fountain of all their <HI>temporal</HI> Prosperity, Safety and Increase. It is remarkable, that several repeat∣ed Attempts for the Settlement of an English Plan∣tation in the Bay of <HI>Massachusets,</HI> upon <HI>worldly</HI> Views, prov'd abortive▪ tho' undertaken by Gen∣tlemen of considerable Powers &amp; Estates; attended
<PB N="16" REF="003280_0022_0FF03CA568386AD0"/>
with a multitude of Servants: <Q>The Difficulties of a Wilderness were too hard for them; they met with such cross Providences, as did quickly dis∣courage; and at last dissipate them.</Q><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>I. Mather's</HI> Relation of Indian Troubles.</NOTE> But it pleased GOD to put a visible Distinction upon the Undertakers of this religious Settlement, and crown their nobler Enterprize with glorious Success. This he did for his <HI>own Name's</HI> sake. They had been e∣minent Confessors, and suffer'd not a little in the Cause of Christ; ventur'd their Lives and Estates over the dangerous Seas, and expos'd their Persons in the Thickets of a hideous Indian Desert, that they might pursue the Designs of Christianity in rightly constituted Churches; serve GOD in the Gospel of his Son, with Liberty of Conscience, ac∣cording to their best Light, and set up the King∣dom of Christ, where Satan's Seat was. The Ho∣nour of Christ therefore was concern'd in the Suc∣cess of their Undertaking, and engag'd his favour∣able Presence to distinguish them. As it was said in the Case of <HI>Israel,</HI> Ezek. 23. 14. <HI>But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a precious Word, our pious Ancestors by Faith liv'd upon,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See a Sermon of the famous old Mr. <HI>Cotton's</HI> upon this Text, intitled, <HI>God's Promise to his plantations,</HI>—Printed in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> Anno 1634.</NOTE> 2 Sam. 7. 10. <HI>I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more: nei∣ther shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime.</HI> It was the GOD of <HI>Israel,</HI> who conducted his People over the wide and hazar∣dous Ocean, and prepared a Sanctuary for them in a strange Land, here in this obscure Corner of the World. We have heard with our Ears; our Fa∣thers have told us, how GOD did drive out the Hea∣then,
<PB N="17" REF="003280_0023_0FF03CA95324A280"/>
and <HI>plant</HI> his People. They got not the Land in possession by their own Sword, nor did their own Arm save them: but his right Hand, His holy Arm, and the Light of his Countenance, because He had a Favour unto them. GOD drove out the wild Tribes of <HI>Indian</HI> Natives, by mortal <HI>Sicknesses</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Plague</HI> amongst them in <HI>Plymouth</HI>-Colony, and the <HI>Small Pox</HI> among the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> which swept away whole Plan∣tations of them together, not one Soul escaping the common Destruction. Dr. <HI>I. Mather's Relation of Indian Troubles.</HI></NOTE> and wasting Warrs one with another; that He might make Room for his <HI>Israel,</HI> and prepare a City for Habitation. Here he made the hungry to dwell; he blessed them also, that they multiply'd greatly, and made them Families like a Flock. They found here a sure Refuge and a Resting place: and had a Table prepared before them in the presence of their Enemies. They experienc'd the Fulfilling of that Word, Job 8. 6, 7. <HI>If thou wouldst seek unto God be∣times, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would a∣wake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righte∣ousness prosperous.</HI> The <HI>Errand</HI> of our Forefathers into a waste Wilderness was not to seek this World's Good, but to seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness: Nevertheless they by the Bounty of Providence receiv'd an Increase of earthly Com∣forts, as additional Blessings.</P>
<P>GOD had Compassion on them for his Covenant's sake, and permitted not the Sword of the Wilder∣ness to devour, or Cold and Hunger to destroy them, or fatal Sickness to make the Land desolate. Tho' sometimes thick and dark Clouds, charg'd with Thunder, and shooting out their firy Arrows, rolled over them; yet GOD prevented Destruction coming upon them, and soon dissipated the threat∣ning

Appearance<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">'Twas a wonderful Providence of GOD particularly that <HI>restrain'd</HI> the Fury of the <HI>Heathen</HI> in our first Times. "It is to be won∣der'd at, (says one of our Historians) that the Church in <HI>Plimouth</HI> shou'd be preserv'd, when other English Plantations cou'd not subsist in this Country, but either the Indians or the Lord's own Hand brought them to a sudden End from time to time. But GOD, who saw that they designed something better than the World, in their planting here, watched over them.—"Some of the ancient Planters have told us, that the Indians being possessed with fears lest the English shou'd in time take their Country from them, did early conspire to destroy them: And the small handful of Christians then in <HI>Salem</HI> (lately arriv'd) were alarm'd with the Report of no less than a thou∣sand barbarous Natives, coming to cut them off, and that upon a Lord's-Day; whereupon they discharged several great Guns, loaden with small Shot, which made such a terrible Rattling among the Trees afar off, that the amazed Indians return'd, without putting their bloody Design in Execution.—Dr. <HI>I. Mather,</HI> ubi supra.</NOTE>. In all their Affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Presence saved them: in his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carry'd them all the days of old. The Righteous saw it and rejoyced: and all Ini∣quity stopped her Mouth, or every Curse was turn'd into a Blessing: the Wrath of Man praised him; and the Remainder thereof he did restrain.</P>
<P>THE Beauty of the Lord our GOD was upon his People, and he established the Work of their Hands. He instructed the Husbandman to Discretion, and satisfy'd the Earth with the fruit of his Works: Causing the Grass to grow for the Cattel, and Herb for the Service of Man, furnishing Seed to the Sower and Bread to the Eater.</P>
<P>HE blessed them also in the City, as well as Field. <HI>Boston,</HI> tho' originally a Plantation for Religion, not Trade, yet hath been a prosperous Town. GOD has been pleas'd to smile on our Merchandize and Navigation, Trade and Business, in years past; so that <HI>Zabulon</HI> rejoyced in his goings forth, as well as <HI>Issachar</HI> in his Tents.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="003280_0025_0FF03CAD55330080"/>
WHOSO is wise and will observe these things, even they shall understand the <HI>Lovingkindness of the Lord</HI> in a very remarkable Instance. The Presence of GOD with our Fathers was their Strength and De∣fence, and the Source of all their Victories, Suc∣cesses, and external Tranquillity and Happiness.</P>
<P>WE may sing very properly on this Occasion in the Language of Psal. 107. <HI>O give Thanks unto the Lord: for he is good. Let the Redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed, and gather'd out of the Lands, from the East and West, from the North and South. They wandred in the wilderness in a solitary way, they found no city to dwell in. Hungry &amp; thirsty, their soul fainted in them. Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his won∣derful works to the children of men!</HI> And so in the Language of Psal. 105.—<HI>Glory in his holy Name, O ye Seed of</HI> Abraham <HI>his Servant, ye Children of</HI> Jacob <HI>his Chosen When they were but a few men in number, yea a very few &amp; Strangers; when they went from one Nation to another, from one Kingdom to another People, He suffer'd no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved Kings for their sakes. He increased his People greatly, and made them stronger than their Enemies. He sent</HI> Moses <HI>his Servant, and</HI> Aaron <HI>whom he had chosen,</HI> to lead them forth by a right way: <HI>and gave them the Lands of the Heathen, that they might observe his Statutes and keep his Laws,</HI> pure and intire, without the Depra∣vation of human Mixtures, <HI>Praise ye the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am bold to express my self on this Occasion very much in Language borrow'd from the <HI>Sacred Story</HI> of the ancient <HI>Is∣raelites:</HI> for I freely confess my Opinion, "if there has been any People in the World, whose general History runs Parallel with <HI>that,</HI> 'tis the People of <HI>New-England.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="003280_0026_0FF03CAFCF4535D0"/>
BUT to proceed,—</P>
<P>AGAIN, The <HI>Presence</HI> of Christ with our Fathers in this Land was the Fountain of all their <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> Happiness and Excellence. It was a plenti∣ful Effusion of the HOLY SPIRIT, that turn'd this Wilderness into a fruitful Field, and gave it a Glory above that of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and above the Excel∣lency of <HI>Carmel</HI> and <HI>Sharon.</HI> He appointed it for a Fold of Flocks; and here as the Lord their Shepherd, he caused them to lie down in green Pastures, restored their Souls, and led them in the Paths of Righteousness for his Name's sake. 'Twas the Presence of the Spirit of Christ with them, in their Families, Courts, Schools, and Churches, that so gloriously succeeded the Means for increasing of Knowledge, and promoting of Order, Peace, Justice, Sobriety, and Religion. Then that word was ful∣filled, Psal. 72. 6, 7. <HI>He shall come down like Rain upon the mowen Grass, as Showres that water the Ground—There shall be a handful of Corn in the Earth upon the top of the Mountains, the fruit thereof shall shake like</HI> Lebanon, <HI>and they of the City shall flourish like Grass of the Field.</HI> The influxive Presence of Christ gave an admirable Energy to the Seed of the Gospel here sown; that an handful of it produc'd a mighty Harvest to the Glory of Christ. 'Twas the <HI>Fruit of the Spirit;</HI> intirely owing to his concur∣rent Influences: without whose powerful Blessing all human Instruments and second Causes have no Significance.</P>
<P>BUT tho' all their Prosperity is to be resolv'd ulti∣mately into the Power of the Lord present with them: Yet it may be observ'd,</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE were <HI>subordinate</HI> Causes, <HI>secondary</HI> Grounds and Reasons, which in their place &amp; order challenge some Regard with us.</P>
<P>IT might be premis'd here, The Flourishing of Religion among our Fathers had a powerful Effi∣cacy
<PB N="21" REF="003280_0027_0FF03CB2D08C5400"/>
as the best <HI>natural</HI> Means, to promote their universal Prosperity, Peace, and external Glory. For as the Wise Man observes, Prov. 14. <HI>The Fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life:—Righteousness exalteth a Nation.</HI>—And let me speak freely, without offence to any, The first Beginners of this Plantation, as to the Body of them, were an excel∣lent Set of real and living Christians, who felt the power of vital Religion in their Hearts; and not such as desir'd only to make a fair shew in the flesh.</P>
<P>DOUBTLESS indeed they had a Mixture of <HI>false</HI> Professors among them: but these being aw'd by the prevailing Example of serious Godliness and the common Zeal against Sin, were generally careful to preserve an Appearance of Religion in their Lives; so that in the first days of <HI>Boston</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> all Iniquity was forc'd to hide its head: it fled the open Light, it sought for Shelter in Darkness, and lurk'd privily in secret places: while Virtue was triumphant, and Religion reign'd every where, in the Conversation, Language and Actions of the Ge∣nerality.—It must further be observ'd, as to the worthiest of our Fathers, they were <HI>but Men;</HI> in a State of Imperfection; and therefore subject to Temptations and sinful Infirmities: And <HI>some</HI> in our best times might be of too rigid and severe a Temper, have less Candour and more Heat with relation to certain Modalities and minute points of Church-Order, than became them; and as one might be of too levelling Principles, so another of too close and narrow a Spirit, and not liberally e∣nough dispos'd towards the Servants of the Publick. <HI>Some</HI> I say, among the first and best Generation of this People, I readily concede, might be deficient and reprovable on such heads as these: Yet even <HI>they</HI> were in general Men of an excellent Spirit, and in other regards appear'd with shining Characters of the Divine Image upon them. But many others
<PB N="22" REF="003280_0028_0FF03CB454FC8730"/>
there were, who possessed their Graces and Virtues, without those their Distemper'd Frames.</P>
<P>THERE were among them many Plants of Re∣nown, Trees of Righteousness, some of the choicest in the whole Garden of Christ: and their Trans∣plantation from <HI>Britain</HI> to <HI>New-England</HI> did but add to their Beauty, Verdure and Refinement. They flourish'd in this Soil, and multiply'd and brought forth abundantly the Fruits of Righteous∣ness, which are by Jesus Christ to the Praise of GOD. Here the glorious <HI>Jesus</HI> (and GOD in him) had the sincerest Honours, the purest Love and most faithful Obedience paid to him:—which engag'd his <HI>Covenant-Presence,</HI> and drew down his Blessing on this People.</P>
<P>AND then the excellent Virtues, which in a flou∣rishing State of Religion, were continually and al∣most universally in Practice, contributed by a ne∣cessary and powerful Influence (<HI>in their own Na∣ture</HI>) to the good Regulation of all kinds of So∣cieties, to the Happiness of Conversation, to the Security and Success of Commerce, and an univer∣sally prosperous State of Externals. By their In∣dustry, Sobriety, Temperance, Mortification and Self-denial, Justice, Integrity, and the like, they took a most effectual Method to secure the Happi∣ness of the social Life, and prevented abundance of such Mischiefs and Disorders, as are the natural Results of those Vices, which have been the Ruine of many a People.</P>
<P>BUT it will be inquir'd,</P>
<P>WHAT <HI>were the peculiar instrumental</HI> Causes, <HI>and more immediate</HI> Reasons <HI>and</HI> Occasions <HI>of such an ex∣traordinary Flourishing of Religion in that day?</HI> What the <HI>Means</HI> under GOD, the <HI>special</HI> Means?</P>
<P>As to the Gospel, the great Instrument of Reli∣gion, that's in it self the same at all times, and the Power and Grace of Christ in themselves the same.
<PB N="23" REF="003280_0029_0FF03CB72DA3E238"/>
We have just Ground then to think there was some∣thing in the Men and the Circumstances of that Age or Generation, which might have some Instru∣mentality, and conduce as a Means, to the uncom∣mon Success of the Gospel, and Flourishing of Chris∣tianity among them.</P>

THE <HI>initial Generation of</HI> New-England <HI>was very much a</HI> Select <HI>&amp; a</HI> Puritanical <HI>People, in the proper sense of the Word.</HI> They were not (as to the Body of them) a promiscuous and heterogeneous As∣semblage: but in general of an uniform Character, agreeing in the most excellent Qualities, Principles and Tempers; Christians very much of the primi∣tive Stamp. As one of our Worthies of the second Generation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Stoughton</HI> in his Election-Sermon.</NOTE> has aptly expressed it, "GOD <HI>sifted</HI> a whole Nation that he might send a <HI>choice Grain</HI> over into this Wilderness":—Seeking a godly Seed to serve him, which should be counted before him for a Generation, even a Generation of his Praise.</P>
<P>IT was as little of a mixed Generation, in regard of their moral Character and religious Profession, that came over first to <HI>New-England,</HI> as perhaps was ever known in the Earth. We read, when <HI>Israel</HI> went up out of <HI>Egypt</HI> in such Pomp &amp; Glory, there went a <HI>mixt Multitude</HI> with them, who were a Snare and Disgrace to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> and by a profane and vicious Example spred Infection among them. But now the first Generation of this People were very much a <HI>chosen</HI> Generation: collected from a Variety of Places, and by a strange Conduct of Divine Pro∣vidence agreeing in the same Enterprize, to form a Plantation for Religion in this distant Part of the World, where they might worship GOD according
<PB N="24" REF="003280_0030_0FF03CB9ADF7B340"/>
to the Light of their own Consciences, without the depraving Intermixture of human Inventions, and without Hazard of Persecution from the Bigots for papistical Ceremonies.</P>
<P>THE Genius or Spirit of the Age was such as in∣disposed the Generality to this sort of Men, I mean the <HI>Puritans,</HI> who were despised as hypocritical or ignorant Precisians; like the primitive Christians, <HI>a Sect every where spoken against,</HI> and <HI>suffering like things of their own Countrymen, even as they did of the</HI> Jews. And then the Remoteness of these Ameri∣can Shores, the Dangers of the Voyage, the Diffi∣culties of a Settlement in an hideous Waste, and the former Defeat of several Essays for a Plantation here; these were Considerations that tended to strike Terror upon the <HI>Worldly minded;</HI> insomuch that few Men of that Complexion had Spirit enough to joyn in so arduous and expenceful an Adventure. Few had the Heart and the Courage to leave their native Land, and pleasant Habitations, Friends and Relatives, and exchange them for the Society of Strangers, and for Hardships, Straights &amp; Distresses in a foreign rude and wild Country; but those who felt the power of that <HI>Faith,</HI> which worketh by Love, which over cometh the World, and is the Evidence of Things not seen, the Substance of Things hoped for.</P>
<P><Q>THERE being a Royal Patent for the <HI>Massachu∣sets</HI> Government, many out of <HI>England</HI> flocked into this Country almost every year, chiefly on the Account of <HI>Religion.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI> ibid</NOTE> But scarce any of a profane Character mingled themselves with the first Comers; and of those that came hither upon secular Views, some were dishearten'd by the Toils and Difficulties they met with, and soon return'd, and others finding this reform'd Climate disagreeable
<PB N="25" REF="003280_0031_0FF03CBBECA857B0"/>
to their vitiated Inclinations, took their speedy Flight away.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">"Some that came hither upon sudden undigested Grounds, did soon return upon as flight Reasons, carry'd by an unstayed Spirit. Others that must have Elbow-room and cou'd not abide to be so pinion'd with the strict Government in the Com∣mon-wealth and Discipline in the Church, also removed hence <HI>Vid.</HI> New England's <HI>First Fruits.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Now being such a select and unmix'd Genera∣tion, this was one Reason of the extraordinary Flourishing and bright Appearance of Religion in that day. It was in the general a shining Collection of sincere Professors; who enliven'd and animated one another, in following after Holiness, by the reciprocal Influences of an alluring Example.</P>
<P>LET it further be observ'd,</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY <HI>were, for the Generality, such as had been trained up in the School of</HI> Patience.</P>
<P>THE Body of the first Comers were Men in their middle age or declining days; who had been inured to Sufferings for Righteousness-sake: being among those Puritan Reformers, who had for many years been witnessing against the Relicts of Popish Super∣stitions in Protestant Worship, and had been perse∣cuted for their Zeal in the Cause of a further Re∣formation. <HI>Many a time have they afflicted me from my Youth, might</HI> Israel <HI>say.</HI></P>
<P>Now their Afflictions being sanctify'd to 'em, they serv'd to their Establishment and Growth in Grace: which made them the more meet and pre∣par'd to conflict with the Difficulties of this new Settlement, to encounter Oppositions, and triumph over Discouragements. They learnt Obedience by the things which they had suffer'd; were purify'd in the Furnace of Affliction, and came forth as Gold out of the Fire refin'd. They were not like him in the Parable of the <HI>Sower,</HI> that receiv'd Seed into
<PB N="26" REF="003280_0032_0FF03CBE2B250370"/>
<HI>stony</HI> places; who heareth the Word and entertains it with Joy, yet <HI>hath he not Root</HI> in himself, and therefore continues <HI>but a while;</HI> for when <HI>Tribula∣tion</HI> or <HI>Persecution</HI> ariseth because of the Word, by and by he is <HI>offended,</HI> discouraged and falls away. No, but they were like him, that received Seed into <HI>good</HI> Ground, which brought forth Fruit <HI>to Perfection.</HI> They were something in the Apostle's Case, who had long been serving the Lord, with many Tears, and Temptations, which befel him by the laying in wait of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the Trial of their Faith (like his) wrought Patience: so that altho' Afflic∣tions awaited them continually, yet none of these things moved them, neither counted they their Life dear unto them, if so be they might finish their Course with Joy, and the Work which GOD had committed to them. They stagger'd not at the Pro∣mise thro' Unbelief, but in some sort like <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Father of the Faithful, were strong in Faith, giving Glory to GOD. Tho' in some days of Temp∣tation, they might seem almost <HI>shaken in Mind,</HI> and ready to give up their Undertaking as desperate: yet they were enabled to overcome at the last, and their <HI>Faith failed not.</HI> They confessed they were Pilgrims and Strangers upon Earth; had a Spirit in some singular measure wean'd from this vain World by the Afflictions and Trials they had met with; and looked for a City to come, that hath Founda∣tions, whose Maker and Builder is GOD. Hence laying aside every Weight, they cou'd run with Patience the Race set before them.</P>
<P>HAVING <HI>receiv'd the Word in much Affliction</HI> all their days from their Youth up, it was the less a Discouragement to them now, that they must <HI>thro' much Tribulation</HI> (tho' of another nature) <HI>enter in∣to the Kingdom of God.</HI> Nay, the prospect of Dif∣ficulties might several ways be of Service to the Work in hand; particularly by keeping them humble, by
<PB N="27" REF="003280_0033_0FF03CC1C5960208"/>
putting an Edge on their Zeal, by exciting them to Diligence and Dispatch, by disposing them to study Union, and (like the Builders of <HI>Jerusalem</HI>) to strengthen one anothers Hands for this good Work.</P>
<P N="3">3. THEY <HI>had</HI> newly <HI>experienc'd the Goodness of God in eminent Works done for their</HI> Salvation: <HI>which had its</HI> sanctifying <HI>Effects upon them.</HI></P>
<P>THE Goodness of GOD serv'd to lead them to Repentance, and engage them to Obedience. The Impression of their Deliverances, and of the En∣largements given them by a gracious Providence, was now fresh upon their Minds, and had doubtless a holy Influence into their Lives. So it was with the first Generation of the <HI>Israelites</HI> that settled in <HI>Canaan,</HI> Judg. 2. 7. <HI>And the People served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the Elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord, that he did for Israel.</HI> "They that saw those Wonders, which GOD wrought for his People, had so much Sense as to believe their own Eyes, and so much Reason as to serve that GOD, who had ap∣pear'd so gloriously on their behalf." The succeed∣ing Generation indeed forgot the Works of the Lord, the great things he did for their Fathers in bringing them out of Egypt, and planting them in a good Land; and so had very little Value for the Religion of their Fathers, but corrupted their ways, and for∣sook the Lord. Whereas the first Generation, who had the great Actions of Providence done for them fresh in Remembrance, these were by a Principle of in genuous Gratitude excited to a zealous serving the ho∣ly One of Israel. So in the first times of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR religious Liberties and Privileges being <HI>new</HI> to them, increased their Value with them, in∣flam'd their Zeal, and made them more diligent in employing aright the happy Opportunities and Sea∣sons of Grace they enjoy'd; and which were esteem'd by them a plentiful Reward of all the Hazards they
<PB N="28" REF="003280_0034_0FF03CC4250F6188"/>
had expos'd themselves to, and Difficulties they were struggling with.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE Business <HI>and</HI> Occasion <HI>of that Day were extraordinary, and such as might conduce to the Flou∣rishing of Religion among the first Generation of this People.</HI></P>
<P>ONE observes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stoughton</HI> ub supra.</NOTE> "When GOD doth in a more than ordinary way of Providence, <HI>form a People</HI> to himself, there is ever that which is <HI>eminent</HI> in the <HI>primitive frame</HI> of things amongst them. Thus GOD speaks of his Vineyard, Isa. 5. 2. <HI>It was planted with the choicest Vine.</HI> Thus also GOD speaks of Judges as <HI>at the first,</HI> and Counsellors <HI>at the beginning,</HI> Isa. 1. 26.—<HI>David</HI> had his <HI>first ways,</HI> 2 Chron. 17. 3. And so Churches have their first ways, when they newly come out of the <HI>forming Hand</HI> of GOD". <HI>Ephesus</HI> had her <HI>first Love</HI> and her <HI>first Works.</HI> And thus it has been with <HI>New-England.</HI> Surely GOD hath often spoke concerning his Churches here, as in Jer. 2. 2, 3. <HI>I remember the Kindness of thy Youth, the Love of thine Espousals, when thou wentest after me in the Wilderness, in a Land that was not sown.</HI> Israel <HI>was Holiness unto the Lord.</HI> O how much of Holiness to the Lord was written upon all their Affairs and Transactions!</P>
<P>Now there was something in the Nature of Things and in the peculiar Circumstances of that Day, which might contribute not a little to the prosperous state of Religion among the first Generation of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>RELIGION was the one grand Design upon which they came hither; the securing of it among them∣selves, propagating it to their Posterity, and plant∣ing it among the Heathen: and this Design took up the Chief of their Thoughts, Cares and Prayers.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003280_0035_0FF03CC667CDF8D0"/>
THE Success of their Undertaking depended very much on the exemplary Piety, Reputation and good Conduct of the first Engagers.</P>
<P>THEY were (as they hoped) laying the <HI>Foun∣dation of many Generations;</HI> the Foundation for a glorious Superstructure: and in this Work they were to be made <HI>a Spectacle</HI> to the World, Angels, and Men. Therefore as they needed GOD to be with them now in a peculiar manner, they were very careful not to forfeit the Divine Presence by any provoking Evils: but did all they cou'd to secure that Blessing of Heaven, which was necessary to give Prosperity to the Work in Hand. "It was needful that the <HI>first Advances</HI> of such a Work should be great and considerable, and that some very notable Progress should be made in the <HI>Begin∣ning,</HI> as the Church and Interest of Christ here lay now more expos'd, and liable to be insulted and crush'd in its infant-state".—Upon this account, as they needed they therefore sollicitously sought, to have the Hand of GOD more remarkably with them at that critical Juncture.</P>
<P>THEY made it their Care to avoid every thing, that might open the Mouths of envious Enemies, to speak Evil of the way of Truth on their account, and it was their Concern that their Light might so shine before others, as that they might glorify GOD in them, and acknowledge the Work they were en∣gag'd in was <HI>of the Lord.</HI> In a word, the Threat∣nings of <HI>Zion's</HI> Adversaries, did but quicken them in their Work, so that they took the greater Pains and made the more Haste in building the Walls of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>THUS, in such Regards as these, the extraordinary Nature and Season and peculiar Circumstances of their pious Undertaking, had a natural Influence to the eminent Prosperity it met with.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="003280_0036_0FF03CC8B44879C8"/>
AGAIN, let it be consider'd,</P>
<P N="5">5. THEY <HI>were Men of an</HI> extraordinary Character, <HI>for the best Accomplishments, that were the</HI> Leaders <HI>of the first Generation in this great Work.</HI></P>
<P>A faithful Magistracy and Ministry are two dis∣tinguishing Articles of the publick Happiness, and contribute as much as any at all to the Prosperity of Virtue and Religion in a place. This was one of the brightest Glories of our primitive Times. <HI>God led his People like a Flock by the hand of</HI> Moses <HI>and</HI> Aaron.</P>
<P>THEIR <HI>civil</HI> Leaders were in general Men of the best Character, for governing Abilities and Virtues. The <HI>Righteous</HI> were in Authority: which made the People rejoyce, and gave Reputation to Religion. There was much of the Kingdom of Christ in the civil Constitution and Laws of the Country, and in the Spirit and Conduct of our primitive Rulers. They were, like <HI>David,</HI> Men according to GOD's own heart; feeding <HI>Jacob</HI> his People with Integrity and Skill. They were as the Heads of <HI>Issachar,</HI> un∣derstanding of the Times to know what <HI>Israel</HI> ought to do. They had the Temper of <HI>Moses,</HI> who chose rather to suffer Affliction with the People of GOD, than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin, which are but for a Season, and esteem'd the Reproach of <HI>Christ</HI> greater Riches than the Treasures of <HI>Egypt.</HI> They consider'd themselves as Rulers under and for CHRIST; as Ministers of GOD, appointed for a Ter∣ror to evil Doers, and for a Praise to them that do well. Accordingly they were warm and active E∣nemies to Vice, Blasphemy, and Profaneness: but diligent Promoters of universal Morality, and zea∣lous Patrons of pure Religion. They were bright Examples of all Godliness &amp; Honesty; Patterns of Justice, Benignity, Gravity, Temperance and Self-denial: and apply'd their Authority for the promoting Piety &amp; Virtue in others. The Interest
<PB N="31" REF="003280_0037_0FF03CCB20617978"/>
of Religion lay much on their Hearts, and enter'd more or less into all their publick Actions, Cares, and Designs. Far were they from the Spirit of the Nobles of <HI>Tek<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> who (when <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was in re∣pairing) <HI>put not their Necks to the Work of the Lord.</HI> But as those that <HI>prefer'd Jerusalem above their chief Joy,</HI> they employ'd a Variety of the wisest Methods for the Advancement of the Kingdom of Christ, and for the Security and Prosperity of his Church∣es in this Wilderness. Like godly <HI>Hezekiah</HI> they spake comfortable words to such as taught the good Knowledge of the Lord, animating and encoura∣ging them in the Service of God. And as <HI>Joash</HI> did not disdain to take Counsel of <HI>Jehojada</HI> the Priest, nor <HI>Josiah</HI> of <HI>Hulda</HI> the Prophetess; So nei∣ther did the ancient Leaders in our civil Govern∣ment disdain to consult with the ecclesiastical Lea∣ders in matters of Weight and general Concern∣ment to the Churches and Common-wealth: but you might often see <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> meet and kiss one another in the Mount of God. They were tender of the Credit and Honour of the sacred Mi∣nistry; taught the People by their own Example to reverence faithful Messengers of the Lord, and were ready to screen such from the Injuries of the Malevolent. They were Members of the Churches themselves, and by setting a beautiful Pattern of Order, Peaceableness, and Submission to the Elders, to their Power and Rule in the Lord, they much contributed to a regular and quiet State of things therein. They were ardent Lovers of the Word and Ordinances of Christ, and Assembly of the Saints; and gave their constant Attendence both in Season and out of Season. Like <HI>Nehemiah</HI> they con∣tended for the Honour of the holy Sabbath, and did many good Deeds for the House of their GOD and the Offices thereof. They were as Eyes to his People in the Wilderness. They were as nursing
<PB N="32" REF="003280_0038_0FF03CCCCA148548"/>
Fathers: they delivered the Poor that cried, and the Fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The Blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon them: and they caused the Widows heart to sing. They put on Righteousness, and it clothed them: their Judgment was as a Robe and a Dia∣dem. In a word, They sought the Welfair of their People: were very tender of the young Plant com∣mitted to their Care, nurs'd and cherish'd it with their benign Influences.</P>
<P>AND then the <HI>ecclesiastical</HI> Leaders, they were also in general Men of the like approv'd Character; eminent in all ministerial Gifts and Graces, which form'd them visibly for great &amp; extraordinary Ser∣vices. There were reforming Rulers: <HI>And there were with them the Prophets of God helping them.</HI> The Ministers of that day very much breathed the Spirit of the old Prophets and of the Apostles; in all things studying to approve themselves as the Ministers of GOD, in much Patience, in Afflictions, in Necessities, in Distresses, in Labours, in Watch∣ings, in Fastings, by Pureness, by Knowledge, by Longsuffering, by Kindness, by Love unfeigned, by the Word of Truth, by the Power of GOD, by the Armour of Righteousness on the right hand, and on the left; in Honour and Dishonour; as De∣ceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well∣known; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoycing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things. They were conspicuous Ex∣amples of Mortification to the World, and of fer∣vent Devotion; Men of GOD; Watchmen upon the Wall; giving themselves continually to the Ministry of the Word and Prayer: preparing their Hearts to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in <HI>Israel</HI> Statutes and Judgments. They were burning &amp; shining Light, some of the purest and brightest; and diffus'd an uncommon Lustre,
<PB N="33" REF="003280_0039_0FF03CCF1E095C90"/>
both by their holy Administrations, and by their exemplary Deportments. Their Hearts and Lips were toucht by a lively Coal from the Altar: and their Faces shone, as <HI>Moses</HI> just come down from the Mount, where he had been admitted to glorious Intimacies with Heaven. In a word, they were Men singularly well accomplish'd, and full of a flaming Zeal for the Interest and Honour of Christ and for the Salvation of Souls.—And now these things, as Means, operated not a little to the Suc∣cess of the Ministry, and so to the Flourishing of Religion. We read concerning <HI>Barnabas,</HI> Acts 11. 24. <HI>For he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghost, and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.</HI> <Q>His excellent Character was that which contributed to his Success. It's granted, that Success is neither of <HI>Paul</HI> that planteth, nor of <HI>Apollos</HI> that watereth, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all of and from GOD, who giveth the Increase. However we must al∣low, that GOD owns Men of extraordinary Grace and Faith and Holiness above other Men, and usually does greater Things by <HI>Such</HI> than by o∣thers.</Q> And then their lovely Character gives a singular Repute to their Profession, and their bright Example by a natural Efficacy adds a peculiar Weight and Force to their Preaching. This acquires a mighty Interest in the Hearts of all that know and see them: and in Consequence thereof gives them a powerful Influence. It was one happy Circum∣stance of our first Days, that the Churches of Christ here were illuminated with a godly and learned Ministry: and their Eminency in sacred Knowledge, and in Grace and Goodness, did subserve very much to the blessed Ends of the Pastoral Care, and abundantly conduce to the Prosperity of the King∣dom of Christ in this Place.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Confirmation of these Characters and my other Re∣marks, I refer the Reader to the HISTORIES of <HI>New-England,</HI> and in particular to that of the late Rev. Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> which contains the <HI>Lives</HI> of a great Number of our Patriots in the <HI>Magistracy</HI> and Worthies in the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the first Generation.</NOTE></P>

FURTHER it may be observ'd,</P>
<P N="6">6. THEY united <HI>in using the best</HI> Methods, <HI>with the greatest Diligence and wisest Application, for the promoting of Religion:</HI> And this was one happy Oc∣casion of the distinguishing Success of it in that day.</P>
<P>IN chief, the Plantation was carry'd on, and Re∣ligion upheld &amp; promoted, by the power of Prayer: yet at the same time, they were found in the use of the most excellent Means. Magistrates in their Places, Ministers in their Station, Heads of Families in their Capacity, Courts of Justice in their Man∣ner, Churches and Schools in their respective Ways, all conspired with a holy Zeal and Vigour to esta∣blish and advance the Kingdom of Christ, by an indefatigable Application of proper Methods. And these under the Direction and Blessing of Heaven were successful Means to that glorious End. What Prosperity might not, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a common Blessing, be expected from such an Union of human Powers and rare exerting of their best Endeavours! This is a Circumstance, that deserves an Asterism to be set upon it, when we are speaking of those Things, which might be of special Advantage to the Success of the Gospel in the first days of <HI>New-England</HI> and of <HI>Boston</HI> in particular.</P>
<P><Q>THEN, says One<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> of <HI>Charlstown</HI> in his Election-Sermon.</NOTE> might be seen Magistrates and Magistrates upon the Seat of Justice cemented together for the Advancement of the Kingdom of Christ in this Wilderness.—Then might be seen Magistrates and Ministers together in way of Advice:—Ministers and Ministers cleaving together in way of Communion:—Ministers

and their respective Congregations together in way of Prayer and holy Worship:—Churches and Churches together in way of Consultation by greater and lesser Synods:—Magistrates, Mini∣sters, and their People together,</Q>—uniting Hands and Hearts in the common Cause, and breathing a publick Spirit; looking not at their own Things, but the Things of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Then might be seen Elders, both ruling well and labouring in the Word and Doctrine, watching for Souls, as they that must give an Account; also Deacons using their Office well, and purchasing to themselves a good Degree. Then might be seen Brethren walking together in Love, and maintaining brotherly Watch and Fellowship. Then might be seen Christians meeting frequently in Pri∣vate for Acts of social Religion, and serious Con∣ference. Then might be seen the Generality of Heads of Families walking in their houses with a perfect heart, endeavouring to make them fruitful Seminaries of Religion; bringing up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, and having their Servants in Subjection with all Gravi∣ty. Then might be seen the Multitude of GOD's People flocking to the Publick Worship with a lauda∣ble Zea! and Devotion. How careful to keep the Lord's day holy! <Q>How diligent in preparing their Hearts! How attentive in hearing the everlasting Gospel, and carrying home divine Lessons to feed their Families with by Conference and Repetition! How fervent in Prayer to GOD for a divine Blessing on the Seed sown! What earnest Desires in those days after Communion with Christ in the holy Sacraments! What Sol∣licitude to seek the Lord after the right Order, as well as in right Ordinances! What pious Care of the Churches fill'd the hearts of the Faithful What Readiness to call for and accept the Help of Councils in any Cases of Difference or Diffi∣culty!

<P>WELL might the Consequence of all this be the flourishing of the Kingdom of Christ. The Churches had Rest, and were edify'd: and walking together in the Faith and Order of the Gospel, and in the Comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiply'd.</P>
<P>THIS brings me to the remaining Head, under which I propos'd,</P>
<P>III. To <HI>say something upon the extraordinary</HI> De∣gree <HI>of Improvement, which this Plant of the Lord has been remarkable for.</HI></P>
<P>BUT here I have in a great measure prevented my self by what has been already said. Shall there∣fore make no Enlargement on this head.</P>
<P>OUR Text compares the Increase of the Gospel∣Church to the Growth of a <HI>Mustard-Plant;</HI> which, tho' in its first Principle it be very small, yet when grown to Maturity and Perfection is <HI>the greatest a∣mong Herbs, and becometh a Tree, so that the Birds of the Air come and lodge in the Branches thereof.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Note, The Mustard-Plant in <HI>Judea</HI> was much greater in its growth, than in these parts of the World.

<P>THIS Description may denote the Beauty, the Stability, and the Usefulness of the Mustard-Plant: Which would naturally lead me (in further pursuance of my present Design) to treat of the State of Christ's Kingdom in this place, when grown to its Maturity, under each of those Heads distinctly.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="003280_0043_0FF03CDA281C6AD8"/>
IT was beautiful, as a stately and spreading Tree, shooting out its comely Branches. <HI>How goodly thy Tents, O</HI> Jacob! <HI>Thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.</HI></P>
<P>IT was stedfast, rooted and establish'd; surviving many shocking Storms, and threatning Changes. <HI>As the days of a Tree are the days of my People,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>and mine Elect shall long enjoy the work of their Hands.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a Tree of Righteousness, very fruitful, to the Glory of GOD, and yielded Seed for After-Ge∣nerations. In them was fulfilled that Word; <HI>The Lord called thy Name, A green Olive-Tree, fair, and of goodly Fruit.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, it was a Refuge for many, who from other parts of the World have repair'd hither, and under a shadowing shroud found Shelter &amp; Refresh∣ment: Worldly Men obtruding themselves for worldly Ends, and holy Men for holy Ends, have made their Nests in the Boughs of this once flourish∣ing Tree.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>"For the fruits of <HI>Congregational Discipline,</HI> as it hath been exercised in our Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> (tho' in much Weakness) the Lord hath not left us without Testimony from Heaven.

<P>Use I. LET <HI>us frequently look back to our</HI> Original, <HI>and consider the</HI> Beginning <HI>and</HI> Progress <HI>of this reli∣gious Settlement.</HI></P>

<P>AGAIN, we should make Reflections on our first Beginnings and Improvements, to stir up ourselves to <HI>give</HI> GOD <HI>the Glory</HI> of his wonderful Works in the days of our Fathers, when he laid the Foundations of our Earth and stretched our Heavens over us; when he brought a Vine (as of old out of <HI>Egypt</HI>) and planted it here, and prepared Room for it, and caused it to take Root, to stand and grow and flou∣rish, notwithstanding all the Opposition made thereto by Men and Devils. "Those Works belong to the <HI>History of Providence,</HI> which GOD would have known and red of all Men".</P>
<P>AGAIN, We must make those Reflections in order to encourage our <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> in GOD; who is still the same powerful and gracious GOD as ever, loves all them that seek him, and loves the Posterity of his People the more <HI>for their Fathers sake,</HI> when they truly seek him.</P>
<P>IN a word, We should make those Reflections in order to <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>quicken</HI> ourselves in seeking and serving our Fathers GOD.</P>
<P>SUCH Reflections may be <HI>directive</HI> to us by a View of the <HI>Example</HI> of our godly Progenitors, who have left us an admirable Pattern of Orthodoxy in Prin∣ciples, Purity of Worship, Strictness of Discipline and Government in the Family, School, Church,
<PB N="39" REF="003280_0045_0FF03CDDFAF3EF28"/>
and Common-wealth, virtuous Manners, modest Apparel, grave and useful Conversation.</P>
<P>AND then such Reflections will tend to <HI>excite</HI> in us a Care of <HI>imitating</HI> them; by a Sense of the pe∣culiar Obligations lying on us, as we are the near Descendents of such holy Ancestors, whose Names will be a Reproach to us, if we do not also inherit their Virtues; by a Sense of the Bonds of the Co∣venant upon us, and of the Bonds of Gratitude we are under, both with relation to GOD and our Fa∣thers; by a Sense of the many Prayers they have put up for us, and of the solemn Charges they have left us, enforced by a very attractive Example, the Example of such as we've the highest Reason to love and venerate the Memory of, all which will but serve to aggravate the Guilt of our Aposta∣sies, and will rise up in Judgment against us, if we forsake the GOD of our Fathers:—In fine, by a Sense of the Awefulness of our standing in GOD's Vineyard, by the Consideration that the Axe is laid to the root of the Trees, that every Plant which is not of GOD's planting, shall be rooted up, and every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit shall be cut down.</P>
<P>THUS we see, those Reflections are many ways of useful Tendency to the Ends of Holiness and the Christian Life; which should strongly recommend them to our frequent and affectionate Entertain∣ment.</P>
<P>Use II. LET <HI>us also reflect seriously on our</HI> present State, <HI>and lay to heart the Apostasies of this degenerate Day.</HI></P>
<P>ALASS! Are we not become as an Oak, whose Leaf fadeth, and the Stock thereof is ready to die in the Ground! May not <HI>Israel</HI> be call'd an empty Vine; bringing forth fruit unto himself! How is the faithful City become an Harlot! The Silver
<PB N="40" REF="003280_0046_0FF03CE1B2DBF560"/>
become Dross, and the most fine Gold changed! This is for a Lamentation, and shall be for a Lamen∣tation.</P>
<P>MAY it not be complain'd, that Strangers having devour'd our Strength, grey Hairs are upon us! We are now become a very mixt Generation: and may I not add in Consequence thereof, a very a∣postate one? May there not justly be exhibited against us a Complaint in the Language of <HI>Judg.</HI> 2. 10. <HI>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</HI> Has not that Word been fulfilled in our Day? Act. 20. 30. <HI>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</HI></P>
<P>HOW many in this Land have early corrupted their Ways, and forsaken the Lord GOD of their Fathers! Have not some renounced the Princi∣ples of Truth, and others the Rules of Practice, in the Worship of GOD, in the Discipline of his House &amp;c. which a humble search into the holy Scriptures brought their pious Ancestors to an Ac∣quaintance with and Profession of! Have not many renounced the Covenant of their Fathers, and be∣come Enemies to the Work of GOD in this Planta∣tion, as a Plantation for the Purposes of Religion!</P>
<P>AND among those who profess in general an Ad∣herence to the Cause of GOD, which brought our Forefathers over to <HI>New-England,</HI> how many are there who practically pour Contempt upon it, by a Coldness in the Defence of it, and by Lives disagreable to it!</P>
<P>SURE I am, we have Reason to take Shame to our selves; all of us, Magistrates, Ministers, and People. We have many Defects, Neglects, and Miscarriages to bewail, by which our Profession has been stained, the Gospel hinder'd, and the Flou∣rishing
<PB N="41" REF="003280_0047_0FEFDB42AC4BE3B8"/>
of Religion obstructed. Alass! If we com∣pare ourselves with our Forefathers (and this let us often do, to humble and quicken ourselves) how vastly short do we come of their bright Exam∣ple! It sadly appears, <Q>They had better Heads, better Hearts, and better Management than we. We want their Capacity, their Character, and their Conduct very much: and therefore no Wonder, if we likewise want their Success. Alass! we want their eminent Gifts and Graces. We want their ardent Love to GOD, his Truths and Ways. We want their peaceable healing Spirit. We want their disinterested Humility and Self-denial. We want their generous Con∣tempt of this <HI>present World:</HI> We want their strong Faith and affecting Views of <HI>another.</HI> And how many Defects are there in the manner of our Conduct! In the Seriousness of our Deportment; the Prudence, the Faithfulness, the Diligence, the Application and Zeal of our Management, in Affairs spiritual and moral.</Q></P>
<P>IN a word, we want very much the Spirit of Prayer, religious Conference, brotherly Watch, and Communion of Saints; the Family-Government, the Church-Discipline, the exemplary Sanctification of the Lord's Day, the Value for Gospel-Liberties, and Affection to the House and Ordinances of GOD, the Zeal for Reformation,—which so distin∣guish'd our pious Ancestors. We pretend to excel them in a <HI>catholick Spirit,</HI> as 'tis call'd, and to enter∣tain more generous Principles than they: but alass have we not very much lost our Zeal for the great Substantials of Religion, as well as for peculiar Mo∣dalities! And is it not to be fear'd, that many un∣der the glorious Mask of Christian Charity hide a cold Indifference to all Religion! O let us see and realise the Degeneracies of the present Day: that there may be no Occasion for a Rebuke of our Stu∣pidity,
<PB N="42" REF="003280_0048_0FF03CE7364090A8"/>
That <HI>gray Hairs are sprinkled upon us, and we know it not.</HI> Let us be humbly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our ma∣nifold Deficiencies, and lament <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Faults and Follies; our Abuses of Prosperity and Liberty, our Pride and Sensuality, our Impieties against GOD and Immoralities against Men, our Hypocrisies, and Envies, and evil speakings, and false Dealings:—Which our Sins do receive the highest Aggravati∣ons possible, from that peculiar Profession we have made of Religion, from that rich Abundance of sa∣cred Opportunities and spiritual Provisions for our Souls, and that glorious Shine of Gospel-Light, we have so long enjoy'd.</P>
<P>O that we may have Wisdom to consider these Things, and to repent in time, that so Iniquity may not be our Ruine! That's the Voice of Heaven to us, Jer. 6. 8. <HI>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my Soul depart from thee.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ speaks to us, as he did to the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> Rev. 2. 4, 5. <HI>Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quick∣ly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, ex∣cept thou repent.</HI> Let us solemnly consider this Re∣proof. O that it may come with a powerful Im∣pression upon our Hearts, and produce agreable Ef∣fects in our Lives! That <HI>New-England,</HI> which is in danger this day to be lost in <HI>New-England</HI> (as one expresses it) may not be bury'd in its own Ruines, and that <HI>Boston</HI> may not (in spiritual regards, as once in temporal) have the reproachful Name of <HI>Lost Town</HI> bestow'd upon it.</P>
<P>BUT now to conclude,</P>
<P>Use III. LET <HI>us all have a holy Concern upon our Minds, as we would have the Lord Jehovah to be</HI> NEW-ENGLAND's <HI>Saviour, that we may answer his just
<PB N="43" REF="003280_0049_0FF03CE9895FE700"/>
Expectations from us, and be yet a Tree of Righteous∣ness, bearing Fruit to his Glory.</HI></P>
<P>WE have Reason to admire the Divine Patience towards a sinning People, That we have not long since been cut down as Cumberers of the Ground, but enjoy as yet a Standing in GOD's Vineyard. It is of the Mercy of the Lord, we are not consum'd. O that the sparing Goodness of GOD may lead us to Repentance! Let us adore the Grace and Power of Christ in continuing us a People yet before him; that the Root is not dried up from beneath, nor the Branches cut off from above; but there's yet Life in the Root, and still <HI>from Him is our Fruit found.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is worthy a particular Notice, the <HI>Distinction</HI> which our gracious Head and Lord has put upon <HI>these Churches,</HI> in con∣tinuing them for so long a Tract of Time on their original Foundations; keeping them in possession of the same Scriptu∣ral Principles, Modes of Worship, Government &amp; Order (with so much of <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI>) which our Forefathers profess'd and practis'd, and maintaining vital Godliness among Professors so conspicuously in a Number of Instances, from Generation to Generation. This is one of the <HI>distinguishing</HI> Glories of <HI>New-England.</HI> For very few Places in the World, where the Gos∣pel at any time has been planted, have continu'd the space of one HUNDRED Years, without either a sad <HI>Dissipation,</HI> or a wretched <HI>Depravation</HI> of their Church-State; Such as through the Patience and Grace of GOD our Saviour, these Churches remain yet happily preserv'd from.</NOTE></P>
<P>WE are weak indeed this day, by the plucking so many Corner-Stones out of our Walls, and by the frowning Aspects of Providence in other Re∣gards. But still let us not give way to unbelieving Thoughts and Discouragements, as if the Lord meant to utterly cast us off. I trust the Lord Jesus Christ has yet a precious Interest among us, which he will not abandon. We see some Tokens that the Spirit of Christ remaineth among us. There's still a Remnant of praying Saints and righteous Ones; such as are of the same excellent Principles
<PB N="44" REF="003280_0050_0FF03CEBDB5C68E8"/>
and of the same excellent Tempers, that our holy Fathers were under the Dominion of; Men, who stand in the Gap, Repairers of Breaches, and Re∣storers of Paths to dwell in. And then the threat∣ning Clouds, which gather over us so thick and fast in these shaking Times, they may be meant unto Good; to humble and reform and do us Good in the Issue. Wherefore lift up the Hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble Knees.</P>
<P>LET us encourage our selves in the Lord, who by his Power created the World out of Nothing, who brought up <HI>Israel</HI> out of Egyptian Bondage, and who form'd and rais'd this his People from low Beginnings. With him is the Residue of the Spirit. He <HI>hath</HI> been mindful of us, and he <HI>will</HI> bless us: He will bless the House of <HI>Israel,</HI> He will bless the House of <HI>Aaron.</HI> Is it not an applicable Encour∣agement to <HI>New-England,</HI> that in Isa. 66. 5. <HI>Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>LET us be sollicitous to do all we can to secure the Continuance of the gracious Presence of GOD among us. To this end, let us be concern'd to get every provoking Evil reform'd: let us be inquisi∣tive into the Causes of the present decay of Piety, and Unsuccessfulness of the Gospel; labour to repair all our Defects, rectify all our Mismanagements, and re∣trieve our Characters. Let us unite all our Endea∣vours, Cares, and Prayers, for the Recovery of lan∣guishing Religion, for the building up Christ's King∣dom, and carrying on the Work of the Lord, that we may see the Return of good Days. That's the Call of Christ to his People here, Rev. 3. 2, 3. <HI>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works per∣fect before God. Remember therefore how thou hast re∣ceived
<PB N="45" REF="003280_0051_0FF03CED5FD1A528"/>
and heard, and hold fast, and repent.</HI> And as in ver. II. <HI>Behold I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</HI> He that hath an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.</P>
<P>LET us often recollect the Errand of our Fore∣fathers into this Land, and pursue that great Inte∣rest, which brought them hither, when it was a Land not sown, an inhospitable Wilderness, where (as they were wont to say) they esteem'd—<HI>brown Bread and the Gospel good Fair.</HI> Let us be mindful of the holy Covenant, wherein they have bound us to be the Lord's, and teach it our Children, who shall tell it to the Generation to come, that they also may set their Hope in the Lord, and that our little Ones may know the Covenant-Care and Faithful∣fulness of the GOD of Israel, under whose Wings their Forefathers came hither to dwell in Safety. Let us attend to the Words of <HI>David'</HI>s dying Charge to the Rulers and People of <HI>Israel,</HI> 1 Chron. 28. 8. <HI>Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</HI></P>
<P>LET us imitate our godly Ancestors in the wise Methods and indefatigable Pains they took for the Security &amp; Advancement of the Kingdom of Christ in <HI>New-England.</HI> Let us cherish the same excellent Spirit and Principles, which were so much their Dis∣tinction &amp; Glory. Let us be earnest at the Throne of Grace for a more plentiful Effusion of the Holy Spirit, in order to a happy Revival of the Work of GOD; that we may hear many inquiring the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, and that true and effectual Conversions may be more frequently seen among us. We are prophesying as in the midst of a Valley full of Bones, dead Men's Bones, very
<PB N="46" REF="003280_0052_0FF03CEEEB872C58"/>
dry: But if God cause Breath to enter into them, they shall live, and renew their Strength, and the dry Bones shall flourish like an Herb. O that we might see it, and our Heart shall rejoyce! May this ancient Church be like a Tree that spreadeth out her Roots by the River whose leaf withereth not, neither ceaseth she from yielding Fruit. May this Town be as a water'd Garden, that seeth not when Heat cometh, abounding with Fruits of Righteousness: and let our Beloved come in∣to his Garden, and eat of his pleasant Fruits! May Salvation be nigh to us, and Glory dwell in our Land! Return, O Lord, for thy servants sake, the tribes of thine inheritance: The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while. The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers; and let these my words, wherewith I have made Supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he may maintain the Cause of his People at all times as the matter shall require; that all the People of the Earth may know that the Lord he is God, the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> and our God, our Fathers God, and the God of our Children. And let us all now agree in making that Resolution, <HI>Isa.</HI> 62. I. <HI>For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for</HI> Jerusalem's <HI>sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the Salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</HI></P>
