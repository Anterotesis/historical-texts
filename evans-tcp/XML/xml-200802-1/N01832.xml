<P>REFLECTIONS On the Present State OF THE Province of Massachuset-Bay in General, And Town of BOSTON in Particular;</P>
<P>Relating to Bills of Credit And the Support of TRADE by Them:</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 2, 1720.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have Read the Account you sent me of the State of your Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> (which in many particulars, agrees to the whole Province, as well as to your Town, &amp; may indeed be con∣sidered as the State of <HI>New-England</HI> in Gene∣ral.) The late Pamphlets on that Subject discover plainly eno' the distressing Circum∣stances we are fallen into, tho' I don't perceive they have been at all Successful to relieve us in the great thing complained of, <HI>viz.</HI> The want of a sufficient Medium to carry on the Trade, of the Town and Country; But on the contrary, what was suggested in them for that end, has produced a quite different Effect, and occasioned much Contention.</P>
<P>It is unhappy, when Persons who are concern'd in one common Distress, can't consult their own Interest, and declare their Minds freely upon it, without giv∣ing Offence to one another. And when men suffer themselves to be thus put out of Temper, they are in no good Condition either to give or take Counsel.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who have Printed their Thoughts on this Occasion, do (as far as I can discern) desire to see their Country in a Flourishing Trade, &amp; Pros∣perous Condition, as they have seen it formerly; They differ indeed in their Conjectures about the Measures proper to be taken at this Juncture for this End; But its much to be Lamented, that Gentlemen who desire the good of their Country, can't declare their differing sentiments, about the best Means to promote it, with∣out falling under the Displeasure of those whom they
<PB N="4" REF="002169_0003_0FBC79B393D6A8B8"/>
study to serve. This tends to Discourage our best Friends from lending us their Assistance when we want it most. If a man that candidly speaks his Mind, &amp; declares what he Judges fittest to be done, under any Difficulty, which he suffers in common with others, must for that reason be treated with Disrespect and Anger, he'l be tempted to conclude its much better for him, to sustain his share of the Calamity, in Silence.</P>
<P>As far as I am able to observe, from what has been Published relating to the Relief so much desired, the principal Controversy in this Matter, is, whether the Emitting more Bills of Credit, or the calling in those that are Extant, will best answer that end?</P>
<P>Some are of Opinion that the Emitting of more Bills, either by the Publick, or by Private Under∣takers, would be the properest way to revive our Trade, and recover us out of our present Languishing Circumstances:</P>
<P>Others, on the contrary, are of Opinion, that the Emitting of more Bills in such manner, would cer∣tainly Augment our Distress; and they are therefore for calling in those that are out, as soon as may be; and Emitting no more.</P>
<P>And each Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, tenaciously adhearing to their own Sentiments, and firmly believing their own Method the Properest, to Extricate us out of our present Dif∣ficulties, are under strong Temptations to look on all that oppose their several Schemes, as Obstructions of the Publick Good, and treat them accordingly. While they themselves also, at the same time, are requited with the same hard Measure.</P>
<P>But this Anger is I think Unreasonable, &amp; without any just Occasion; for although these Opinions seem Repugnant, yet if we could be perswaded to consider them (&amp; the reasons by which they are supported)
<PB N="5" REF="002169_0004_0FBC79B55905A3C0"/>
calmly, and be cool in our Reflections upon them, we might probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a way to Reconcile them, &amp; shew how they may be understood &amp; improved to that Common Good, which both parties aim at; &amp; even perswade the Dissenting Gentlemen themselves to be of one mind, in the manner of promoting it.</P>
<P>This is what I truly desire. Tho' I must confess I should be loth to write my mind so freely on this Subject, if I were not well assured of your Candour. Who ever undertakes the part of a Mediator, where the Contention between the Parties is at all warm, may expect to be encountred with Prejudices from both sides; But I fear nothing of such a Kind, from a Gentleman of Your Wisdom and Temper. I am satisfied that whatever Favour You have for either of these Opinions, it will not be unacceptable to You, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o see that a good Use may be made of them both;</P>
<P>And this is what I aim at; My Design is to avoid entirely, what may appear in the form of Opposition, or tend to overset either of these differing Opinions, and only to consider, Whether there are not certain Principles which both Parties will agree to, and which may well be Improved to unite them firmly in one and the same Measure, for promoting the Publick Interest.</P>
<P>And if it should prove that I am mistaken in my Thoughts, or deceived in my Hopes, yet to attempt what is so Desireable, as it can't give any just ground of Offence to any, so I am sure, it will never be taken so by You.</P>
<P>I shall therefore observe here a few things, which I take to be beyond Dispute &amp; serviceable to the end which I propose, and submit them to your better Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002169_0005_0FBC79B68B487938"/>
In the first Place. It will easily be granted, that</P>
<P>Trade or Commerce is necessary to a peoples Prosperity, or Flourishing in the World. This, some of your late W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ters. lay much weight on; from hence they urge the necessity of being provided with a Medium for carrying it on; And if others seem to speak of Trade as a Disadvan∣tage to us, it must be understood only with respect to some Circumstances which attend ours in parti∣cular, as, (for Instance) our carrying it to a degree beyond what we are able to manage; Which is as I suppose, what they mean by our Overtrading; Or our giving to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> long a Credit, whereby people that are never like to Pay, are Tempted to run in Debt: Or because its Managed mostly by a Credit which is not Supported as it ought to be; and is therefore vari∣able, and raised or depressed as Managers happen to meet with Chapmen. But it would be unfair to un∣derstand them as real Enemies to our Commerce.</P>
<P>No Country has within it self every thing Useful and conducive to the common Flourishing and Pros∣perity of its Inhabitants. Many things will be wanting, especially in new Settlements (as ours may in many Regards be considered) for the Sub∣sistence and Comfort of Persons, which things must be supplyed from other Places; and that supply must ordinarily be by Trade.</P>
<P>And the same holds true, of persons in the same Country, who by the means of Commerce must sup∣ply each other, with what one wants and another has: Providence has so Establish'd the State of Mankind, that the World in General, or any par∣ticular Country in special, can't Flourish and be Prosperous, without such a mutual Communication of Goods, or Useful Commodities.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002169_0006_0FBC79B7F9437838"/>
Again,</P>
<P>To the carrying on this necessary Commerce, some proper Medium must be made use of. It is not absolutely Impossible but that it may be done by Barter, or exchanging of one Commodity for another; but since the In∣vention of Money, that method has been much laid aside; and Money has been Universally Re∣ceived &amp; Improved, as the (most suitable) Medium, for carrying on of Trade, between Persons &amp; Coun∣tries. This I think is a Point uncontroverted. That steady value which the general esteem of Men has put upon Silver, (Intrinsecally considered) and its aptness to be formed (as it has been by Authority,) into suitable pieces, of greater and lesser Quantities, and those of a Determinate Value, easy to be known, has rendred it the most agreeable Medium, by which to rate the Value of all Mer∣chandize, and to be made use of in purchasing the same. And 'tis as unquestionable, that</P>
<P>The Trade of any Country must be Supported by the Produce of it. The only solid Foundation which any Country has to erect a Trade upon, are such Commodities as may be spared from their own Occasions, and exported to supply the Wants of other Places. Whether those Commodities are of the Growth or Produce of such Country, or imported from other Countries, at such a cheap rate, that they may be exported again &amp; Sold to Advantage.</P>
<P>But generally, The Trade of any Country is sup∣ported by its own proper Produce, <HI>i. e.</HI> By such Effects as are raised, or Manufactures which are wrought therein. And its no less certain,</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002169_0007_0FBC79B98DE79200"/>
That,</P>
<P>What ever Trade is Managed in any Country to Advantage, the Export must exceed the Import. When the Produce of any Country is so considerable that the Exportation of it, exceeds the Value of what Goods are Imported from other Places, and consumed in it, such Country will have that Overplus, or Ballance of its Trade in Cash. When our G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Provision, Furr, Lumber, Fish, or any kind of Manufacture, or what we can raise either on the Land, or out of the Water, and can export to other Parts, exceeds in Value all the Goods from other Places, which we have Occasion to Buy and Consume, the Ballance of Trade will be so much in Cash to our Advantage. On the contrary, when the Import is more in Value than our Export, the Ballance will be to our Disadvantage, so much as that exceeds this; If we want European or any other Goods, in such a Degree, that all the Produce of our Country, which we can spare, is not Equiva∣lent to it, we shall be so much more in Debt, than we can Pay with our Produce; And this Ballance must be Paid in Money.</P>
<P>I may here also Observe, That</P>
<P>The Medium of Trade, does Natural∣ly follow Trade, and is Gained by it. Such Countries as can't Produce the matter of this Medium, <HI>viz.</HI> Silver, out of their own Bowels, have ordinarily no way to supply themselves with it, but by their own Produce. And when any Country can afford the Commodities, wanted in other Places, at such a Rate, that those who Improve themselves in Trade, can purchase them with Money and Export them to Advantage, their own Interest will put
<PB N="9" REF="002169_0008_0FBC79BC92E71898"/>
them upon bringing Money into such a Country for that end.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>The Medium of Trade, or Money, thus brought into a Country, will remain there in a Sufficient Plenty for its ordi∣nary Occasions, so long as the Ballance of their Trade is in their Favour, <HI>i. e.</HI> So long as such Country does not Purchase &amp; Con∣sume more forreign Goods, than it vends of its own.</P>
<P>And hence it follows, That</P>
<P>The Diligence and Frugality of a Peo∣ple, is Necessary to Preserve the Trade of any Country, in such a State of Advan∣tage to themselves. No Country can hope to be in a Flourishing Condition, when the People of it are not Diligent in their Business, or don't govern themselves as to their Expences, so as not to ex∣ceed their Produce or Income; for so much as they exceed that, they will be in Debt: and that Debt may in time exceed the value even of their Real Estates, &amp; Reduce them to be worse than nothing. This shews, that the Discourse of those Gentlemen, who are for retrenching our needless, Extravagant Expences, as one necessary part of the Project, to remedy our present Distress, is very reasonable. Nothing can be more Obvious, than that those whose Expences are greater than their Gains must needs in time be Reduced to Penury; though the best Me∣dium of Trade be never so plenty among them. We
<PB N="10" REF="002169_0009_0FBC79BE00145708"/>
ought therefore to consider, what our diligent La∣bour, and good Husbandry will afford us, and be sure to keep within those Bounds, in our Apparel. Buildings, Tables, Funerals, and every Article of Expence. For if by any Methods we spend more than we Gain, we are not like to escape the Distres∣ses of Poverty.</P>
<P>It must be considered also, That</P>
<P>A Diligent and Frugal People may sometimes be in great want of Money. Their Circumstances may be such, that their Interest and Preservation may demand on a Sudden, a greater Sum, than they can possibly furnish themselves with at the time. So it sometimes happens in War, when their all may ly at Stake, and they must do their utmost to save themselves. Such a Defence may put them to so great a Charge, that a Sum of Money sufficient to defray it, can't be Collected at the time, tho' their Estates are worth very much more and they are well able in process of Time to produce a much greater Sum; And so it may happen on other Occasions; as, for the carrying on of some great and useful Works, or profitable Manufactures, or for purchasing some great Privi∣ledges which would be of general Benefit to them for Generations to come.</P>
<P>And certainly</P>
<P>In such Cases as these, it may be very Prudent for such a People to make use of their Credit. <HI>i. e.</HI> To supply such Urgent Occasions, with their BILLS or BONDS, whereby they oblige themselves to raise and Pay the Sum
<PB N="11" REF="002169_0010_0FBC79BFA14C5A60"/>
of Money which they want, in some Convenient time. This PUBLICK CREDIT, if it be good, (<HI>i. e.</HI> if there be no doubt but that such a People are well able to raise, &amp; will Honestly Pay the Money, by the time,) will supply the want of Money, and furnish them with what they need as effectually, as the Money it self. It would be the undoubted Interest of particular Persons, to furnish the Publick with Money, or any thing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they have Occasion for, on their Credit thus good and undoubted.</P>
<P>Of this Nature some of our Publick bills are esteemed to be, <HI>viz.</HI> Those that have been Emitted for the Payment of Publick Debts. (And for that reason I suppose some Gentlemen speak of the Bills themselves, as a Medium of Trade,) because they supply the Want of Money; though I think what they intend therein, has been mistaken by many; as if they meant another Medium, clear and distinct from Money; Whereas I don't take them to intend, that Money is not, properly speaking, the Medium of Trade. For we still reckon the Value of every thing we Trade in, by <HI>Pounds, Shillings, &amp; Pence;</HI> Which Terms are Denominations, or Names of several Pieces of Money; and these Names are constantly used in Trade to express the worth of any Merchandise; Money therefore abides the stan∣dard, by which the Prices of the Goods we Trade in, are computed and expressed. And when we use our Publick Bills in Payment, it is a Trading for Money <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ill, though that Money is not to be pre∣sently Paid, but by a certain time, for which the Bill given in Payment is (<HI>or ought to be</HI>) a good Security. And he that takes the Bill in Payment, is assured, that if he has that Bill at the time set for the Payment of it, he shall if he please have its Value in Money. Whence its evident that these
<PB N="12" REF="002169_0011_0FBC79C14DF453A0"/>
Publick Bills, are really of the same Nature with the Bill or Bond of a Private Person, of such un∣doubted Credit, that every one would take his Bill for <HI>Twenty,</HI> or <HI>Forty Shillings,</HI> or any other Sum as soon as so much Money. Because that Bill is such a Security for the Money, as he dares rely upon; and which he is assured will not fail him.</P>
<P>But then we must always remember, That</P>
<P>When any Necessity or Consideration whatsoever, puts a Country on making use of their Credit in want of Money, such Credit ought to be very punctu∣ally Supported. And to the Support of this Credit, Two things must necessarily be evident to all that shall have any Occasion to depend upon it.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Ability of such a Country, to answer by the time, all the Bills they have given, if it be demanded of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Integrity and Honesty of such a Country, that as They are well able, so They will certainly be as good as their Word; and keep time punctu∣ally with all that have trusted them, and taken their Bills, in payment.</P>
<P>If either of these be Suspected, their Credit will Sink; and if such a Country don't remove all just grounds of such Suspition, their Credit will lower as that Suspition rises, &amp; when it has passed thro many Degrees of Contempt, will come to nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002169_0012_0FBC79C2F29D3AC8"/>
Further,</P>
<P>The Supporting of such a Publick Credit, is neither Impracticable, nor a matter of meer Prudence only, or purely Arbitrary, which may be done or neg∣lected at Pleasure, but such Credit can and ought to be Supported. I say it can, because its supposed in this case that such a Country has a Sufficient Estate, &amp; can fulfil all its Engage∣ments. Now for such a Country to suffer their Credit to be Diminished, or sink, so that perhaps <HI>Twenty Shil∣lings</HI> in their Credit, will be no better in Trade to those that have it, than <HI>Fourteen,</HI> or <HI>Twelve,</HI> or <HI>Ten Shillings</HI> in <HI>Money,</HI> is not only to deal Falsly, and be worse than their Word, but its also a great wrong to multitudes; For some persons, must necessarily loose or suffer as much wrong, as the <HI>Publick Credit</HI> becomes worse than <HI>Money.</HI> Wherefore this Credit ought in Justice to be Supported; and wilfully to suffer it to Sink, is to be guilty of great Unrighte∣ousness, and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jury to many, and particularly to all Publick Ministers and Creditors, as also to Widows &amp; Orphans, whose Interest &amp; Protection ought to be Consulted.</P>
<P>To this I may add, That</P>
<P>When the Publick Credit, so made use of, is well supported, it can't be Injurious. For if the Publick Bills Emitted are kept up to their full Value during the whole time of their Circulation, whoever takes them at the Value of their Denomination, &amp; gives for them, what he would Sell for so much <HI>Money,</HI> may immediately
<PB N="14" REF="002169_0013_0FBC79C3F63A6688"/>
make the same use of them himself; And so may every one who successively receives them, till the time of their Circulation is up, and there is <HI>Money</HI> to answer them, to all that desire it.</P>
<P>Let now the <HI>Publick Bills of Credit</HI> be thus Sup∣ported, which They ought to be, and will be, if we can but convince those that have occasion to receive them in Trade, that we are not more in Debt than we are worth, and that we will honest∣ly pay our Debts, and I can see no harm in gra∣tifying the Desire of those Gentlemen, who are for Emitting more Bills, for present Use, if there should by any means happen a scarcity of the <HI>Me∣dium of Trade,</HI> or <HI>Money,</HI> among us; and other∣wise, They don't seem to desire it.</P>
<P>I will add this one Thing more.</P>
<P>If any particular Persons have occasion to take up Money on Use, I don't see why the Publick in such case may not supply them, by lending the Publick Credit, when Money is not to be had. And if during such Loan, the <HI>Publick</HI> will Sup∣port the Credit they lend, so that it may hold its value in Trade, and be as good as <HI>Money,</HI> I don't see but They may justly receive the same Recom∣pence for the loan of this <HI>Credit,</HI> as they might for lending the like Sum in <HI>Money.</HI></P>
<P>Those Gentlemen therefore, who declare against Emitting more Bills on Loan; or, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same Thing, against the Country's lending their Credit, must be understood, only, in Case the <HI>Publick Credit</HI> should remain under its present Dis∣advantages,
<PB N="15" REF="002169_0014_0FBC79C649852DF8"/>
and not be restored to its just Esteem as it may, and in Justice, Ought. For in such Case, Every one may be sensible, that to increase the Number of Bills of Credit, would be a great Mischief, and certainly increase the Wrong which many suffer by their being already so greatly dis∣paraged.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>Publick Credit</HI> as often as it is made Use of, either in paying of Debts or in Loan, be Supported, and kept up to its just Value, so that it will in Trade answer the End, and be as Useful as <HI>Money,</HI> I suppose no Gentlemen would take Offence at a more Extensive Improvement of it; or think it an Injury for the Country to make such a Loan of their Credit, to any persons that can make a good Use of it. Especially consider∣ing that tho' the Persons that Borrow it, design to improve it to their own particular Advantage, Yet if they succeed in their design, as its to be hoped They may, it will at last redound to the Publick Advantage;</P>
<P>Upon these Considerations, I think those Gen∣tlemen who have differed so much in their Senti∣ments, about supplying at this Juncture the want or scarcity of the Medium of Trade, may well be Reconciled.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P>Whether we do, or do not, make any further Use of the <HI>Publick Credit,</HI> certainly it concerns us to hearken to what is so earnestly insisted on by many Gentlemen; the retrenching Our Expences, that They may not exceed our Gains; or that our Import may not be greater than our Export; without which we must needs be greatly distressed, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en undone.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002169_0015_0FBC79C883E94C08"/>
And, Those who are for calling in all the Bills of Credit emitted, by the time set for it, may with∣out any Danger be gratified, Provided the Publick does but supply, what want we may be in of Cash, by Emitting more Bills of Credit.</P>
<P>And, Those who think it very necessary at this Juncture, that the Government should still make use of their Credit, both to Pay their Debts, &amp; to serve other Emergencies, may safely be gratifyed. Provided effectual care be taken to support such Cre∣dit, the whole time it is made use of.</P>
<P>Nay even, Those that Favour a Private Bank or Credit, rather than a Publick one, may for ought I know be gratifyed without Danger, provided it be under such a Publick Regulation, as would satisfy all, that the Bills of such a Private Bank should be upheld in Trade, and be made as useful as Money, during the Convenient time set for their Circula∣tion; and that when such time is expired, those that have any such Bank Bills in their Possession, may if they please exchange them for Money.</P>
<P>This therefore is the chief thing necessary, that whatever Credit there may be Occasion to make use of, it should be supported in such an esteem and Usefulness as it ought to have in Trade, that is to say (at least) equal to Money during the whole time of its Circulation. That this is practicable appears from what has been said already; against the Jus∣tice of it no man can reasonably Object. And were this once done, we should soon see an end of the Contention about Emitting more Bills. For, Then no man would have any just reason to fear,</P>
<P>Either, That the Bills would be hoarded up, more than Cash.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002169_0016_0FBC79CA20CBA140"/>
Or, That our Credit would be extended too far;</P>
<P>Or, That our Bills would be Improved for any longer time, than till our Ordinary Occasions of Trade &amp; Expence, may well enough be Supplyed, with such a Stock of Money, as by our Diligence &amp; Good Husbandry, we may procure.</P>
<P>Because, When such a Stock is attained, there will then be no necessary Occasion for Improving Credit any longer in such a manner.</P>
<P>Wherefore those Gentlemen who have differed in their Sentiments, about Emitting more Bills, &amp; calling in those that are Emitted, would I am perswaded find themselves well satisfied, in any fair &amp; reasonable Project, to restore &amp; keep in good Credit the Bills Improved in Trade, so that they should be of Value equal to Money; until such time as we might be furnished with a Sufficiency of Money, to supply our Ordinary Occasions, and to carry on a Trade, within the Compass of our A∣bilities, <HI>i. e.</HI> such an one as does not exceed what we are able to spare out of our own produce, for the carrying of it on;</P>
<P>Especially considering that when the Bills of Credit are restored to the Value of Money; a much less Quantity of them would suffice for these Oc∣casions.</P>
<P>And I can't see but They must on both sides find themselves disappointed at last, if there should be no care taken to revive the Credit of Our Bills, but they are suffered to remain under the present disadvantage, and increasing Discount.</P>
<P>For, Suppose No more Bills be emitted, and those that are out, be drawn in as fast as may be, by
<PB N="18" REF="002169_0017_0FBC79CB74FA6890"/>
Sueing the Mortgages on which the most of them are Lent, then indeed the Mortgagers may many of them loose their Estates, but They that happen to have the Bills in their keeping, may be as far as ever from receiving either Money, or Money's worth, for them. For as there never was any <HI>Pub∣lick Provision</HI> made for the drawing in those loan Bills by a Common Rate; or having Money in the Treasury to Ballance against them; so neither can those that have them, be sure of having any part of the Mortgaged Estates in Exchange for them. When the Publick has sued the Mortgages and re∣covered the Estates, who can tell what they may think good to do with them? Some have thought that when the Mortgagers have paid by Interest, the Value of the principal, the principal will be Re∣mitted to them; and if so, there may then be no Mortgaged Estates, for these Gentlemen to take in Exchange for their Bills; or (which is the same thing) to purchase with those Bills, if they reserve them for that end.</P>
<P>This project of Remission some may think un∣reasonable, but it may not seem so to others, who may possibly have a great Influence in the ordering of that Affair.</P>
<P>Or if it should, yet they may think it fair to lease those Estates to the Mortgagers with Condition of Redemption in some convenient time; since it may seem hard in such a case if no time of Redemp∣tion be allowed. Or</P>
<P>It may be thought necessary to Sell them for <HI>Money</HI> only. These are things which may appear here∣after, in a quite different View, to the Government, both at Home, &amp; Here, than they do now to us.
<PB N="19" REF="002169_0018_0FBC79CFA4E338D8"/>
Upon all which accounts it may not be so safe for any Gentlemen, who may reserve such Bills by them, to Flatter themselves, that they shall ever be able to exchange them, for Moneys worth, (or their Va∣lue in Money) unless the Credit of them be Restored &amp; Established.</P>
<P>If it should be supposed, that when the Mortgaged Estates are Recovered, the Government must then call in by Rate all the outstanding Bills, or Cur∣rant Money in stead of them; and that then there would be Money in the Treasury to Exchange for them.</P>
<P>This Supposition is as Uncertain as any of the former. Those that may be then in the Administra∣tion, may be of another Mind.</P>
<P>There is no Provision of such kind made by any Act of the Government, whereby They stand engaged so to do; Which, If it had been design'd at last, would probably have been declared at first. Yea, The Contrary seems to be implied by the Acts for the Loan of Bills; for it does not appear by those Acts, that Those Bills were to have any Credit, but what the Mortgages gave them; Which men might rely upon as They saw Good.</P>
<P>Its pretty remarkable, that many who please themselves with this Conceit, that the Government must at last, (if Suing the Mortgages don't bring in the Bills) take this Method, and provide that all the Outstanding Bills should within a conve∣nient time be drawn into the Treasury by Rate, or Money instead of them; are nevertheless utterly against the same Project, when its proposed as a present method to recover the Credit of our Bills even to the Value of Money.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002169_0019_0FBC79D1CEAE1268"/>
But, How can such Gentlemen who are discou∣raged from making this Attempt now, imagine, that Those who are in the Administration when the Mortgages are Sued out, will be perswaded to do the same thing on a Push, which must needs be much more difficult, and a far greater burthen on the People. If there be any Reason for it, Yet it does not seem so fair for Us to think, that those who come after Us, if they can help it, will put themselves to greater Difficulties to pay the Debts we have contracted, than ever We were willing to do our selves.</P>
<P>It seems therefore that tho' no more Bills should be Emitted, it is of great Consequence that the Credit of those that are now Extant should be restored and maintained during the whole time of their Circulation.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if no Care be taken to revive the Credit of our Bills, what Satisfaction can we take, in the Emission of More? When it is so manifest that the Discount which is come on those that are already emitted, and which has been the Occasion of so much Unrighteousness, and great wrong to many, will thereby be increased!</P>
<P>I will make but one Remark more, which shall be</P>
<P>Upon the Case of those that have taken up Bills on Loan. Which many begin to look upon with Concern. Their Estates are Mortgaged; And if the Bills that are Extant, are (as some think) in Hands which reserve them, for some considerable Advan∣tage, so that the Mortgagers can by no means procure them, to Redeem their Estates, They will in a little time be forfeited:</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002169_0020_0FBC79D2F837A9A0"/>
In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a Mortgage given to a private person, it would be look'd on as a Hardship, if the Mortgagees should take Advantage of the Mortgagors, and eject them out of their Land, as soon as the time set in their Mortgages is expired. Nor is this ordina∣rily done. The Mortgagees don't think much (having good Security for their <HI>Money</HI>) to allow many Years after the time is up, to the Mortgagors, to procure the <HI>Money</HI> and save their Estates; and this is thought but a reasonable Favour, provided the Mortgagors duely pay the Interest.</P>
<P>Whereas, as soon as the Mortgages made to the Publick are forfeited, they must its concluded, be Sued out immediately; this being the way proposed to bring the Bills into the Treasury, and keep them from sinking into the last Contempt.</P>
<P>But if our Bills of Credit, were restored to be as good as <HI>Money,</HI> men would soon unlock their Hoards, &amp; make use of the Bills they keep by them. By which means the Mortgagors might be able to procure what they want to redeem their Estates; And if they should not be able to do it by the time set in the Mortgages, the Publick might, as well as any Private Person, allow them more time for it, and not put them to the Extremity of Redeeming their Estates now or never. For if during such time, the Credit of our Bills be kept up to a Par with <HI>Money,</HI> as they may &amp; ought to be, No Person could be Injured by such a Favour to the Owners of the Mortgaged Estates, or have the least reason to be troubled at it.</P>
<P>To me therefore, it seems, as if the restoring &amp; upholding our Bills of Credit to their just Value, would be an excellent means to put an End to these Controversies, and give every one Content. Then,
<PB N="22" REF="002169_0021_0FBC79D498639B48"/>
If a suitable Quantity of Bills should be Emitted, They would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as <HI>Money</HI> during the time of their Circulator. And if we would be per∣swaded to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Expences and live within our Income, We m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ht probably be supplyed with a sufficient stock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the carrying on our Trade, Which every one d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es, Nor should we be necessitated to put the Country or particular Persons to such a streight, as the immediate calling in all our outstanding Bills, without emitting more, its feared would do.</P>
<P>But, Its to be hoped that by this reviving the Credit of our Bills, We should in a little time, and by easy Degrees, extricate our Selves out of those Difficulties which at present bear so hard upon Us. Whereas if This ben't considered as a necessary and principal Part of the method for our Relief, I can't but think, for the Reasons which I have given You, that other Measures will not be Effectual to attain this desirable End.</P>
<P>I have thus, <HI>SIR,</HI> at Your Desire communicated to You my Thoughts, on the Subjects you referred to Me. Whether They may, and in what manner They may be best improved to the Publick Benefit, I must refer to Your Prudence; and am, SIR,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Humble Servant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
