<HEAD>The Whole ART of LEGERDEMAIN; OR, HOCUS POCUS IN PERFECTION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>LEgerdemain is an operation whereby one may seem to work wonderful, im∣possible, and incredible things, by agility, nimbleness, and slight of hand. The parts of this ingenious art, are principally four.</P>
<P>First, In conveyance of balls.</P>
<P>Secondly, In conveyance of money.</P>
<P>Thirdly, In cards,</P>
<P>Fourthly, In confederacy.</P>

<P N="2">2. He must have strange terms, and em∣phatical words, to grace and adorn his ac∣tions; and the more to amaze and astonish the beholders.</P>

<HEAD>How to pass the Balls through the Cups.</HEAD>
<P>You must place yourself at the farther end of the table, and then you must provide your∣self three cups, made of tin, and then you must have your black sticks of magic to shew your wonders withal; then you must pro∣vide four small cork balls to play with; but do not let more than three of them be seen upon the table.</P>
<P>Note. Always conceal one ball in the right hand, between your middle finger and ring finger: and be sure make yourself per∣fect to hold it there, for, by this means, all the tricks of the cups are done.</P>
<P>Then say as followeth.</P>
<Q><L>Gentlemen, three cups—'tis true</L>
<L>They are but tin, the reason why,</L>
<L>Silver is something dear,</L>
<L>I'll turn them in gold, if I live, &amp;c.</L>
<L>No equivocation at all:</L>
<L>But if your eyes are not as quick as my hands</L>
<L>I shall deceive you all.</L>
<L>View them within,</L>
<L>View them all round about,</L>
<L>Where there is nothing in,</L>
<L>There's nothing can come out.</L></Q>
<P>Then take your four balls privately be∣tween your fingers, and so fling one of them upon the table, and say thus,
<Q><L>The first trick that e'er I learn'd to do,</L>
<L>Was, out of one ball to make it into two</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="028540_0006_0FD939F42CC1AC10"/>Ah! since it cannot better be,</L>
<L>One of these two, I'll divide them into three,</L>
<L>Which is call'd the first trick of dexterity.</L></Q></P>
<P>So then you have three balls on the table to play with, and one left between the fingers of your right hand.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Operation of the Cups is thus.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Lay your three balls on the table, then say, Gentlemen, you see here are three balls, and here are three cups, that is, a cup for each ball, and a ball for each cup. Then, tak∣ing that ball that you had in your right hand, (which you are always to keep private) and clapping it under the first cup, then taking up one of the three balls, with your right hand, seeming to put it into your left hand, but retain it still in your right, shutting your left hand in due time, then say, <HI>Presto, be gone.</HI></P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028540_0007_0FD939F6C43C80D0"/>Then taking the second cup up, say, Gen∣tlemen, you see there is nothing under my cup; so clap the ball that you have in your right hand under it, and then take the se∣cond ball up with your right hand, and seem to put it into your left, but retain it in your right hand, shutting your left in due time, as before, saying, <HI>Verda, be gone.</HI></P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Then take the third cup, saying, Gentle∣men, you see there is nothing under my last cup; then clapping the ball you have in your right hand under it, then take the third ball up with your right hand, and seeming to put it into your left hand, but retain it in your right; shutting your left hand in due time, as before, saying, <HI>Presto, make haste;</HI> so you have your three balls come under your three cups, as thus: and so lay your three cups down on the table.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Then with your right hand take up the first cup, and there clap that ball under, that you have in your right hand; then saying,
<PB N="7" REF="028540_0008_0FD939F9529AD528"/>
Gentlemen, this being the first ball, I will put it into my pocket; but that you must still keep in your hand to play withal.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>So take up the second cup with your right hand, and clap that ball you have concealed under it, and then take up the second ball with your right hand, and say, this likewise, I take and put into my pocket.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Likewise, take up the third cup, and clap∣ping the cup down again, convey that ball you have in your right hand under the cup, then taking the third ball, say, Gentlemen, this being the last ball, I take and put this into my pocket. Afterwards say to the com∣pany, Gentlemen, by a little of my fine powder of experience, I will command these balls under the cups again. As thus,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="028540_0009_0FD939FADBD49688"/>So lay them all along upon the table to the admiration of all the beholders.</P>
<P>Then take up the first cup, and clap the ball you have in your right hand under it, then taking the first ball up with your right hand, seem to put the same into your left hand, but retain it still in your right, then say, <HI>Vade, quick be gone when I bid you, and run under the cup.</HI></P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Then taking that cup up again, and fling∣ing that you have in your right hand under it, you must take up the second ball, and seem to put it into your left hand, but re∣tain it in your right hand, saying, Gentle∣men, see how the ball runs on the table.</P>
<P>So seemingly fling it away, and it will ap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r as thus.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>So taking the same cup again, then clap∣ping the ball under again, as before, then taking the third ball in your right hand, and seem to put it under your left, but still
<PB N="9" REF="028540_0010_0FD939FE5B066948" MS="y"/>
retain it in your right, then with your left hand seem to fling it in the cup, and it will appear thus; all the three balls to be under one cup.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>And if you can perform these actions with the cups, you may change the balls into ap∣ples, pears, or plumbs, or to living birds, to what your fancy leads you to. I would have given you more examples, but I think these are sufficient for the ingenious, so that, by these means, you may perform all manner of actions with the cups.</P>
<P>Note. The artificial cups cannot well be described by words, but you may have them of me, for they are accounted the greatest secrets in this art: therefore, I advise you to keep them as such, for this was never known to the world before.</P>

<HEAD>How to shew the wonderful <HI>Magic Lanthorn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This is the magic lanthorn that has made so much wonder in the world, and that which Friar Bacon used to shew all his ma∣gical wonders withal.</P>
<P>This lanthorn is called magic, with re∣spect to the formidable apparitions that by virtue of light it shews upon the white wall of a dark room. The body of it is general∣ly
<PB N="10" REF="028540_0011_0FD939FFF9B07690"/>
made of tin, and of a shape of the lamp; towards the back part, is a concave looking glass of metal, which may either be sphe∣rical or parabolical, and which, by a grove made in the bottom of the lanthorn, may either be advanced nearer or put farther back from the lamp, in which is oil or spi∣rit of wine, and the match ought to be a little thick, that when it is lighted, it may cast a good light that may easily reflect from the glass to the fore part of the lanthorn, where there is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with the perspective in it, composed of two glasses that make the rays converge and magnify the object.</P>
<P>When you mean to make use of this ad∣mirable machine, light the lamp, the light of which will be much augmented by the look∣ing glass at a reasonable distance. Between the fore part of the lanthorn, and the per∣spective glass, you have a trough, made on purpose, in which you are to run a long, flat thin frame with different figures, painted with transparent colours upon glass; then all these little figures passing successively before the perspective glass, thro' which passes the light of the lamp, will be painted, and repre∣sented with the same colours upon the wall of a darkroom, in a gigantic and monstrous manner.</P>
<P>By this Lanthorn you may shew what man, or woman, or birds, or beasts, and all sorts of fish that are in the sea: so if any gentleman
<PB N="11" REF="028540_0012_0FD93A0198176B60"/>

<P>This pudding must be made of tin, con∣sisting of twelve or thirteen little hoops made as in the figure following, so as they may almost seem to fall one through ano∣ther, having little holes made at the biggest end thereof, that it may not hurt your mouth, hold this pudding (for so it is called) privately in your left hand, with the hole end uppermost, and with your right hand take a

<P>This bushel must be turned neatly like unto the egg-boxes, so that they cannot find ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where it opens, and you must have a false lid to clap on and off; upon that false lid glue some bird-seed, and then you must have a true lid made to clap neatly upon the false one, now you must have your artificial bell to shew with your bushel.</P>
<P>You may make your bell with wood or

<P>The manner how to use them is as fol∣loweth: Note, you must be sure to fill the top of your bell with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed before you begin to shew; then saying, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntlemen, you see I have nothing in my bell (which they can∣not, if you hold it by the handle) nor have I any thing in my bushel, therefore I will fill my bushel with seed, and, in filling it, clap on the false lid, and no man can tell the contrary.</P>
<P>Then ask any body in the company to hold that seed in their hands and you will command it all under the magical bell; so clap the true lid on, and then ring your bell, and the seed will be gone out of your bushel into your bell, to the admiration of all the beholders.</P>

<PB N="36" REF="028540_0037_0FD93A4664EB4370"/>
the little finger of the left hand may meet with it, which is the easier, the readier, and better way: in the beginning of your shuffle∣ing, shuffle as thick as you can, and in the end throw upon the stock the nether card, with so many more at the least as you would have preserved for any purpose, a little be∣fore or a little behind the rest, provided al∣ways that your fore-finger (if the pack lay behind) creep up to meet with the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m card, and when you feel it, you may then hold it until you have shuffled over the cards again, still leaving your kept card be∣low: being perfect herein, you may do al∣most what you list with cards by this means, what pack soever you use, though it con∣sisteth of eight, twelve or twenty cards, you may keep them still together unserved next to the card, and yet shuffle them often to satisfy the curious beholders.

to do this feat, you must have cards made for the purpose, half cards we may call them; that is one half kings and the other half aces, so laying the aces one over the other, nothing but kings will be seen, and then turning the kings downwards, the four aces will be seen; but you must have two whole cards, one a king, to cover one of the aces, or else it will be perceived; and the other an ace, to lay over the kings, when you mean to shew the aces; then, when you would make them all blank, lay the cards a little lower and hide the aces, and they will appear all white.
