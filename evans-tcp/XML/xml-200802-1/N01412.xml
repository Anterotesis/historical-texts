<HEAD>The Preface to the Reader.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not singularity or Ostentation that I appear in Print, but my Christian Duty, in Honour to God, and the Salvation and well being of the souls of men, in the De∣tection of the Anti-christian Practice in <HI>making Slaves</HI> of them who bear the Image of God, <HI>viz.</HI> their fellow, Creature, Man; A Practice so <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>inhumane,</HI> that the more it is thought upon by judicious men, the more they do abhor it; It being so vile a contradiction to the Gospel of the blessed Messiah.</P>
<P>And if our Negro-Masters were put to it, to bring an Instance that a man denyed the Christian Faith, I think they could not bring a stronger Instance, then that he was found in the Practice of making Slaves of men. And furthermore, I doubt not, but this may be to some a very unwelcome Theam, and they would wonder to find their beloved <HI>Deti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah,</HI> the making Slaves of Negros, and others rejected, although the more moderate Christians do full well know, that. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

the Truth on my side. And if these Lines should come to the <HI>Island of Great Britain</HI> (my native I and) I hope the sincere Chri∣stians there of all Sects will commend my Christian care, in detecting so gross a cor∣ruption as this, crept in by reason of the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and Gains it brings to our <HI>American Chri∣stians;</HI> And I hope the <HI>learned Christians</HI> there will admonish their <HI>American Brethren,</HI> for putting such an Affront upon the ever blessed <HI>Messiah,</HI> and his glorious Gospel as this their Practice doth, in making Slaves of Men.</P>
<P>This Practice cannot but be very offensive to sincere and honest hearted Christians, that this Practie should be heard among the Heathen, to harden them in such <HI>heathenish Practices.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Reader,</HI> I am going to shew thee a Wonder, and that is, this thirty years that <HI>I</HI> have been in <HI>America,</HI> this Pra∣ctice has been carried on almost in profound silence, which it is like the Negro-Masters will take it the harder to be opposed now. It is true, <HI>John Tillotson</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> hath two Sermons in print concerning <HI>Restitution,</HI> and he tells them there, that <HI>they cannot have Admittance into Heaven without making Restitution of the wrong done to there fellow

Creatures.</HI> And if this be applyed to the wrong done to Negroes, I have Bishop <HI>Til∣lotson</HI> on my side. This and many other excellent things have dropt from the Pen of that (in many things, no doubt, an) excel∣lent man.</P>
<P>And <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> calls the Inslaving of Negroes, <HI>A crying Sin in the Land.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And George Fox</HI> printed against this Pra∣ctice, and sent it to the <HI>Barbadoes-Quakers.</HI> Such was the early care of this excellent man above forty years ago; But his Chri∣stian Admonition was rejected. It is true, there are some excellent souls among them still, who came out of <HI>Old England,</HI> that have kept their Integrity, namely <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Thomas Chalkley,</HI> and others, who when they see this Abomination acted by their <HI>American Brethren,</HI> they openly bear Testimony in their publick Assemblies, and declare against it (as I am credibly informed) There was another Paper Printed by (I think) <HI>G. Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th</HI> his Party at <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and half a Sheet was printed against this Practice at <HI>London,</HI> called <HI>the Athenian Oracle,</HI> But the most of all those writings I doubt are destroyed by <HI>Negro-Masters,</HI> that the Reader will find them almost as scarce to be found as the <HI>Phenix Egg.</HI> And last-of

all, I have appeared against this Practice although I have lain dormant above th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thirty years; for the which I acknowledge my Failure before God and man, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> desire forgiveness of God, and next I desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the forgiveness of man; for the reason that I was silent so long, because I waited for my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etters to undertake the work; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had appeared in this Work, it is like I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> been silent still.</P>
<P>Now whether they will hear or forbear for the future, I hope to be clear of their Blood, and if they will not repent and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Restitution, I cannot help it; for I have faith∣fully warned them of their Danger; For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> earnestly contended for the Truth, and honestly declared against this <HI>Inriching Sin,</HI> in making Slaves of Men. And now I think to end my Preface as I began it, and that is, I chiefly design the <HI>Honour of God,</HI> and next the <HI>Welfare and Salvation</HI> of Souls. If hap∣pily I might be instrumental to deter any one Soul from being catcht with this inrich∣ing Sin, or instrumental of the Repentance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Restitution made by one Soul that is and alrea∣dy guilty, then I desire they should give God the Glory, and I make no Question in having my Reward.</P>

<HEAD>The American Defence Of The Christian Golden Rule.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Argument the First.</HEAD>
<P>THe more a Man becomes confor∣mable to the Attributes of God, the more just and holy he is, and the more beloved of God, and consequent∣ly a more perfect Christian.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> then, God hath given to man a Free∣Will, so that he is Master of his own Choice (whether it be good or evil) and will in no way force and compel the Will of man; yea, not unto that part which is good, far less unto evil, notwithstanding his Attribute of Omnipotence. And seeing then, it is thus with God and his Creatures, we ought also to do so by our fellow mortals, and therefore we ought not to force and compel our fellow creatures, the Negroes, Nay, not although we judge it for them a bet∣ter way of living; For when we force their will, this is a manifest Robbery of that noble Gift their bountiful Creator hath given them, and is a right down Contradiction to the afore∣said Attributes of God, and consequently an Anti-Christian Practice And so, those that op∣pose God and his Attributes, they may expect
<PB N="2" REF="001678_0009_0FB97FC10B222C88"/>
to incur his Displeasure; So they may find a pregnant Instance in <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his Egyptian Task-Masters.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> This Practice contradicts Christs com∣mand, who commanded us, <HI>To do to all men as we would they should do to us,</HI> or as we would be done by. Now the buying and selling of the <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>Souls</HI> of Men, was and is the Merchandize of the Babylonish Merchants spoken of in the <HI>Revelations.</HI> Now the Tyranizing over and making Slaves of our Fellow Creatures, the Negroes, every one knows, or may know, this is not the way they would be done unto.</P>
<P>Now, I have shown you, <HI>first,</HI> That this Practice opposes God and his Attributes, and 2<HI>dly,</HI> That it opposes Christ and his Command; And what is this in Effect but to bid Defyance, and to live in Opposition to Christ and his Go∣spel? and if so, it is a high Degree of an An∣tichristian Life and Practice.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>my beloved Friends,</HI> who are con∣cerned in this Practice, as you love the Welfare of your immortal Souls, I intreat you (for it is for your sakes I labour) not lightly to look over these considerations, if ye think to receive a <HI>Reward for the Deeds done in the Body;</HI> For how will ye answer when ye are brought before <HI>Gods Tribunal,</HI> and there appear naked and bear before the Son of Man, if ye have lived and dyed in Opposition to his everlasting Gospel, for the confirmation of which, for our Sakes, cost him his precious Life, and now for a little worldly Interest, got in Opposition to Christ and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gospel, by the Bondage and Inslaving of Negroes; the very Reading of which is enough to make
<PB N="3" REF="001678_0010_0FB97FC29DE2F870"/>
all Hearts concerned to tremble. The very thoughts of this makes me declare, for all the Riches and Honours of this world, I would not be found in this Antichristian Life and Practice.</P>
<P>3<HI>ly,</HI> I have shewed before, That GOD, who is no respecter of persons, hath given to all men a Freedom of their Wills, to pitch upon their own choice, for both Soul and Body, which are the only parts, next unto the Life, the free donation of our heavenly Father, in this ter∣restrial world; But it would seem by the Negro-Masters Practice and Arguments, that God did miss the matter, by his Wisdom, when he gave the Negros (his Creatures) the Freedom of their Wills; but our Negro-Masters have found out, by their Inginuity, how to mend this (seeming) Defect, in two respects, to wit, that is to rob them of their Freedom, and make them bond-Slaves and their Posterity forever. And in the next place, they can highly inrich them∣selves by the Bargain; by the unparallelled and never enough lamented Bondage and Slavery of those poor Creatures and handy work of God, And can afford to keep themselves with white hands, except at some Times they chance to be be sparkled with the Blood of those poor Slaves, when they fall to beating them with their <HI>twisted Hides</HI> and <HI>Horse-whips,</HI> and other <HI>In∣struments of Cruelty,</HI> too barbarous here to relate, all done in the name of their deservings and correction. And furthermore, they can afford (by their beloved <HI>Diana,</HI> their Slaves) to go with <HI>fine powdered Perriwigs,</HI> and great <HI>bunched
<PB N="4" REF="001678_0011_0FB97FC446EA9970"/>
Coats;</HI> and likewise keep their Wives idle (<HI>Jezebel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> like</HI>) to <HI>paint their Faces,</HI> and <HI>Puff,</HI> and <HI>powder their Hair,</HI> and to bring up their Sons and Daughters in <HI>Idleness</HI> and <HI>Wantonness,</HI> and in all manner of <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Prodigality,</HI> in <HI>deek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng</HI> and <HI>adorning</HI> their Carkasses with pufft and powdered Hair, with <HI>Ruffles</HI> and <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p-knots, Ribbands</HI> and <HI>Lace,</HI> and <HI>gay Cloathing,</HI> and what not; All, and much more, the miserable Effects produced by the Slavery of Negroes; and their Slaves in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lest Raggs,</HI> much ado to cover their nakedness, and many of them not a <HI>Shirt</HI> upon their Backs, and some of them not a <HI>Shoe</HI> upon their Foot in <HI>cold Frosts</HI> and <HI>Snow</HI> in the Winter Time, that many of them have their Feet and other mem∣bers <HI>frozen off,</HI> by reason of their Cruel Usage; and some of them must lie by the <HI>Fire</HI> among the <HI>Ashes,</HI> or be driven out to lie in <HI>Huts</HI> out of Doors among the worst of their <HI>Dogs,</HI> for some of the finest of their Dogs they permit to lie in the bed with themselves.</P>
<P>And they accomodate their Slaves which such Names as these, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by, Mando, Ming<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Jack, Hect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> and <HI>Hagar,</HI> and such like Names they give to their <HI>Dogs</HI> and <HI>Horses.</HI></P>
<P>And when their Masters see fit they will <HI>hang them up by their Thumbs,</HI> and then command another Negro to beat him so long, as his Master sees fit; this he must not refuse to do, if it were his <HI>own Father,</HI> nay, further, they will force them to be very <HI>Hang-men;</HI> And notwithstanding of all this, some of them must go with a <HI>hungry Belly,</HI> and that which they do get to eat (ye need not
<PB N="5" REF="001678_0012_0FB97FC871375D80"/>
doubt but it) is the <HI>worst the House affords.</HI></P>
<P>Now all that fear God cannot but know that those men who use such Cruelty are not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> but are even destitute of <HI>humane Civility,</HI> and <HI>Pity</HI> and <HI>Mercy;</HI> There∣fore their Example can be no more a Rule for keeping Slaves than it is for using such inhumane Cruelty, which all sober Men abhor; For it cannot be expected that men of such Cruelty have much regard to the lawfulness of what they do, and it is great Pity that men who are na∣turally more moderate and merciful should be led to the Practice of an unlawful thing by the Example of the <HI>vilest of men.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the Servants of such cruel Masters; By this Description all may see, that they are put under an unavoidable Necessity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inning to maintain <HI>self-Preservation,</HI> an Instinct of Nature belonging to all the Creatures of God; So self-preservation puts them to <HI>steal, rob,</HI> and <HI>lye,</HI> and many other sinfull Actions; nay, some of them when they see themselves surrounded and trappaned with all the Miscries aforesaid, and many more, then they go into Dispair, and miserably <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves,</HI> and som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their <HI>Masters,</HI> to get rid of their Tortures and mi∣serable Slavish Life There was one of them (<HI>I</HI> think) within less then two years ago, shot himself whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a Gun, near his Masters House, within a few miles off the place where I write this lamentable story.</P>
<P>Now for those heinous Sins, as Lying, stea∣ling, Robbing, and Self-Murder; they cannot
<PB N="6" REF="001678_0013_0FB97FC92A5E6B98"/>
escape Punishment, by the Justice of God. Now as <HI>I</HI> have said before, they being put under such necessity of sinning, and they themselves being but <HI>Infidels,</HI> I desire the Negro-Masters to inform me, who must answer for all these abominable Sins?</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Reader,</HI> I have given thee a small View of the Usage and Treatment of these poor miserable Slaves; for if I would enlarge upon their Usage, I need write nothing else to swell up a Book to I know not what bigness; The <HI>parting of Man</HI> and <HI>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> being such a heinous sin committed by the Negro-Masters, I cannot pass by; The parting the Husband from the Wife, and the Wife from the Husband, and their Children from them both, to make up their Masters Gains, they force them thus to break the seventh Command, and commit Adultery with other strangers, or other mens Wives or Husbands. These and the like Usages, is enough to make them believe, there is no God at all, and harden them in Idolatrous Worship, and make them blaspheme against the holy God, that he takes not immediate Vengeance on such notorious Offenders. And here are the <HI>first three</HI> Commands broken, occasioned by their Masters. And the breaking the <HI>fourth</HI> is evident to all; for some, for want of Food and other necessa∣ries, for all their hard weeks Labour to inrich their Master, for to maintain Self-preservation, puts them to work on the First Day of the Week, to supply their pure Necessities, and so break that which their Masters call the Christian
<PB N="7" REF="001678_0014_0FB97FCA975E25B0"/>
Sabbath. And so, here is all the Commands of the first Table broken by them, occasioned by the <HI>Cruelty</HI> of their Masters. And their Children being sold from their Parents, they unavoidably cannot honour them; and here is the breach of the <HI>fifth.</HI> And to get rid of their miserable Tortures, many kill themselves and others; and here is the breach of the <HI>Sixth.</HI> The parting of Man and Wife makes them commit <HI>Adultery</HI> with others; and here is the breach of the <HI>Seventh.</HI> To maintain Self-preservation, they unavoidably must <HI>steal;</HI> and here is the breach of the <HI>Eight.</HI> Then they run away to avoid their Tortures, and when they are catcht their Master will ask them, <HI>Do you not deserve to be hung up and Beat?</HI> and here they must bear False witness against themselves (which is worse than against their Neighbours) and say, <HI>yes, I do, we serve to be hung up and Beat;</HI> and here is the breach of the <HI>ninth.</HI> And when they are in great necessity of Food and Rayment, and have it not of their own, they unavoidably must covet it of their Neigh∣bours, and here is the breach of the <HI>Tenth.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Reader,</HI> here are all the Ten Commands of God (occasioned by their Masters) broken by them. This is such a Charge, that I doubt it will be too hot or too heavy for the Negro-Masters to answer.</P>
<P>And now that those Christians who in their <HI>Baptism</HI> did engage to keep <HI>all gods holy commands,</HI> should not keep them, but break them them∣selves and for their own Gains, do lay all man∣ner of unavoidable Necessities upon their Slavs
<PB N="8" REF="001678_0015_0FB97FCC0AA58E30"/>
to break them also; This is a poor encourage∣ment for Godfathers indeed.</P>
<P>I may truly say, as <HI>Nestori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> did, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and was banished from them by the prevailing Party in his Time, to the outermost part of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> among the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> because he said and taught. That <HI>Mary</HI> ought not to be called the <HI>Mother of God,</HI> but the <HI>Mother of Christ,</HI> and that it could not go down with him to say, that God was a year old, or a Month, or a Day old, &amp;c. As we may read in that great Book called <HI>Eusebius.</HI> And when he found great Kindness from those Barbarians he wrote a learned and eloquent bet∣ter to those Christians that banished him, to this Effect, that <HI>For his Banishment he could undergo it patiently, but his Fear and Lamentation was, that their Actions should go unto the Heathen, that thereby they should be imboldened in</HI> Heathenism,<HI>and give them Advantage to blaspheme against Christ and the Christian Religion;</HI> And so advised them not to be a stop and a Hinderance to that glorious Gospel that had cost so many Lives for the spreading and advancing of it.</P>
<P>Now, I can truly say, that this is my con∣cern as it was the concern of <HI>Nestori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> that ever the Actions of our <HI>American</HI> Negro-Masters should go unto the <HI>Turks</HI> and other <HI>Heathen</HI> Nations, to harden them in <HI>Mah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>metant'm</HI> and other <HI>Heathenism,</HI> and to imbolden them to blaspheme against Christ and his Gospel, and the purest Christianity.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> wish this may come to be the concern of
<PB N="9" REF="001678_0016_0FB97FCEE0596328"/>
our Negro-Masters, That they be not hinder∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, but Advancers of the glorious Gospel, and then I am sure they will be loath to do to any other Man what they would not be done by themselves.</P>
<P>Now, it is not unpossible but that an <HI>American Negro Master</HI> and a <HI>Turk</HI> should meet and dis∣course this Point betwixt them, And the <HI>Turk</HI> should say, <Q>I am well pleased, Brother that you and we agree so well in this Point, <HI>viz.</HI> in ma∣king Slaves of them we can have the Mastery over; And I doubt not but many of us have been at a stand whether it may not be a sin to use our fellow Creatures so cruelly: but now I think it is Time to give over such <HI>D</HI>oubts, when we see it so mightily practised by the <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> I mean the <HI>American Christians;</HI> I make this Distinction, because it is not practised in <HI>Europe.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><P>And now, Brother, I would argue a little plainer with you, How comes it to pass, that you find Fault with us for making Slaves of Men, when you your selves do the same? How can that be an evil and a sin in us, which is a Christian Practice among your selves? And I hear, that when any of your Slaves turns Christian, and is baptized and receives the Christian Faith, you keep them in perpetual Slavery for all, and so they have no encourag∣ment to turn Christian upon that score, which shews to me, that you have but a small Esteem for your Religion, or at least are very lukewarm for <HI>Proselytes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001678_0017_0FB97FD0D8C64518"/>
This is worse then <HI>Turks;</HI> for when any of our Slaves turn, and embraces the <HI> Mah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me∣tan Faith,</HI> they are no longer Slaves, but pre∣sently set free, and many Times preferred to Places of <HI>Trust</HI> and <HI>Dignity,</HI> such zeal have we for Proselytes, and our Religion.</P>
<P>And how comes it that you differ among your selves in this Practice? for there are some zealous men among you, that both dispute and write against you, and they declare it to be an Antichristian Practice; And the Christians in <HI>Europe</HI> do not practice it. And I have heard that the Gospel was, <HI>Glory to God in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Highest,</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Good Will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o all Men upon Earth,</HI> and that ye should do to all men as ye would they should do to you. And if this be the Gospel of the blessed Messiah, I will tell you plainly, I took upon you to be apostatized in this Point, and I would advise you either to embrace the rest of our <HI>Mahometan</HI> Practices (and then we would receive you) or otherwise to walk more closely to the Rules and Practice of <HI>Christianity;</HI> and not to content your selves with a Name, and to be a perpetual Scandal to the rest of Christians.</P></Q>
<P>So far <HI>Mahometan.</HI></P>
<P>ANd now, <HI>Christians</HI> of after Ages to come, Its not unlikely, but ye may meet with the Force and Assaults of <HI>N</HI>egro-Masters, as we in this Age have done, (And so, <HI>Christian,</HI> defend thy self as we have done before thee) And so to
<PB N="11" REF="001678_0018_0FB97FD38C1FF548"/>
cloak their Impiety, and to make the best S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew of Pretences they can, they may thus begin.</P>
<P><HI>Negr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Master. Had not Gods People (in all Ages) bond Slaves,</HI> bought with their Money?</P>
<P><HI>Christians Answer.</HI> So had they their many <HI>Wives</HI> and <HI>Concubines,</HI> and I see no more Reason to plead for Slaves then to plead for many Wives and Concubines.</P>
<P><HI>Negro Master.</HI> It is true, we have as good Grounds for the one as for the other, and I will freely acknowledge that if the many Wives and Concubines would bring in such Advantage to us as our Negro-Slaves do, I doubt not but we should plead as st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fly for the <HI>one</HI> as for the <HI>other;</HI> But the many Wives and Concubines not being ad∣vantagous, we in Discretion drop that part of our Argument, and keep close to that which brings us Gains? So I need not enlarge to trouble my self to cite every chapter and Verse, for I take it for a Maxim, That all the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> where it treats upon that subject, is upon our side; and I have heard some of us alledge out of the New Testament, that <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> was a Slave, but since <HI>I</HI> have read <HI>Pools Annotations</HI> on the Place, I will not be so unmanly as to assert it as a Proof; I think I have Proof enough, that have the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> although I meddle not with the <HI>New.</HI></P>
<P>And now I think I have proved by Scripture, that keeping of Slaves was practised of Old; And now I intend to shew that it is according to the <HI>Christianity of our Times, First</HI> by the con∣sent
<PB N="12" REF="001678_0019_0FB97FD72EE53BD8"/>
and agrement of all the several Sects of Christians.</P>
<P>I begin then with the famous <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> (who are not ignorant of our Negro-<HI>P</HI>ractice) who by their Christian care do send their <HI>Missionaries</HI> hither to <HI>America,</HI> to teach the Inhabitants here the Principles and Practices of Christianity; And it is evident those Missio∣naries do make their Gains by Negro Slaves, and have their Houses crawling <HI>black</HI> with them, by which they set an Example to others to follow their s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eps; And not a word of Sin in all this. And I never heard that a Bishop ever wrote a word against it; by which I think it is evident that the making Slaves of Negroes is according to <HI>Church-Christianity.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Secondly,</HI> I can shew by that famous and zealous Sect of <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> who have been di∣ligent followers of the Principles and Practices of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> witness the Rejecting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mass-Book, and many other Roman Superstitions, so kind kindly entertai∣ned (as they think) by some of their Prote∣stant Brethren; and a People very zealous in their Lives and Church Discipline; and yet both Preachers and People do joyntly agree with the Church in making Slaves of Negroes.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I can shew by that pious Sect of <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> Witness some of them their Mo∣desty in Apparel, and their Dexterity in the Point of Water-Baptism, in telling the rest of Christians in Print, that they do cheat the World in the Point of Infant Baptism; but they very
<PB N="13" REF="001678_0020_0FB97FD81F9DD770"/>
Lovingly embrace this Practice in making Slaves of Negroes.</P>
<P>Now if the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and <HI>Baptists</HI> did but agree so lovingly in other Points as they do in making Slaves of Negroes, I think they might be stiled <HI>One Community.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if those several Sects of Christians and their unanimous Agreement in this Practice of making <HI>Slaves of Negroes,</HI> as I have already shewed, does not amount to a Proof, I know not what will,</P>
<P><HI>Christians Answer,</HI> I do confess this is a Proof, that some of all those several Sects do Practise this Point of Impiety, which I would readily have confessed without a word of Proof, except what mine Eyes have seen; For all these Sects of People both by Principle and Practice do <HI>Fight,</HI> and <HI>Kill,</HI> and take away the Lives of many Thousands in Battles, for their inriching of themselves, and for their own Advantages, and therefore it is no Wonder that all those Sects agree so well in making Slaves of Negros, or others whom they can get the Mastery over (for their own Advantage.)</P>
<P>But as this is very forreign from <HI>Christianity,</HI> and out of the Peaceable Gospel of the blessed Messiah (for <HI>worrying, Tearing</HI> and <HI>Killing</HI> are the marks of <HI>Dogs, Wolves</HI> and <HI>Bears,</HI> which is the Practice of those aforesaid Sects of <HI>Christians,</HI> as they call themselves: but the Innocence of Lambs and Doves was and is the Characteristick of <HI>Christians</HI>) so I think this is sufficient to over∣set what was alledged for a Proof by the Pra∣ctice
<PB N="14" REF="001678_0021_0FB97FDA504A70D0"/>
of all those severol Sects of Christians for enslaving of their fellow Creatures the Negros For I thought the Gospel had not been <HI>Cruelty</HI> but had been <HI>Innocence, Love, Meekness, Patience, Long-Suffering,</HI> and plenteous in <HI>Forgiveness,</HI> and other <HI>Emblems</HI> of the Attributes of God, and that Christians were to <HI>give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Backs to the Smiter</HI> and <HI>their C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecks to them that pluck off the Hair.</HI></P>
<P>But I have a further Answer for you, and that is, I utterly deny that either <HI>Church-men</HI> or <HI>Pres∣byterians</HI> have generally agreed in making Slaves of Negros; For some of both have preached and some have printed against it here in <HI>North America;</HI> And some that have had Negroes their Conscience would not allow them to keep them for Slaves, but after some Time of Service they set them free.</P>
<P>Hence I infer, That making Slaves of men is an evil so abominable in the nature of it that men whose Principles are so large as to allow of <HI>Killing men,</HI> cannot allow of making Men <HI>Slaves,</HI> accounting it worse to <HI>Rob</HI> men o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Labour,</HI> who have done them no harm, then it is to kill them that rise up against them.</P>
<P>And hence I infer, that none would believe it lawfull, if they were not either blinded with the love of Gain, or with the plausible Pretences o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such as are.</P>
<P><HI>Negro Master.</HI> Hold! I think I have another Proof, which, according to your own Argu∣ment I think will bind you. There is another numerous and famous sect of Christians, called
<PB N="15" REF="001678_0022_0FB97FDBF0233A18"/>
<HI>Quakers,</HI> who by their Practice do show that they have all those aforesaid Marks which thou hast nominated, and therefore by consequence of your Argument the only <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real Chri∣stians,</HI> and yet there is no People more forward to make Slaves of Negros than they are; And now, if they be infallibly guided in all the other Principles and Practices of <HI>Christianity,</HI> one would think they could not be erroneous in this, <HI>viz.</HI> in making Slaves of Negros. And now, although all my other Arguments should fail, yet this last, one would think, should silence you.</P>
<P><HI>Christians Answer.</HI> This, I confess, is the greatest Wonder, to see a People so conformable to the rest of the Principles and Practices of Christianity, induced by the Example of the looser Sorts of Christians, to embrace an enrich∣ing Sin, and sacrifice that command of Christ, to do to others what they would not be done by.</P>
<P>And yet I cannot see how they can be a Proof in this, above all other Christians, especially when it is thought by some of the <HI>honest hearted</HI> among them, that about the <HI>eleventh</HI> Year of the eighteenth Century the most of them Sa∣crificed their primitive <HI>I</HI>nnocence, when they so lovingly agreed and joyned with the other Sects to pay the Souldiers their proportion of Wages to go in the Expedition against their Neighbours of <HI>Canada;</HI> And when they loose their <HI>lnnocence,</HI> I know not what they keep that is <HI>lovely</HI> among them.</P>
<P>But here <HI>I</HI> must make a Distinction; There
<PB N="16" REF="001678_0023_0FB97FDE47623E58"/>
was an honest hearted Remnant among them, that suffered joyfully the spoiling of their Goods in that Day, for the Answer of a good Conscience, and the Defence of the Antient <HI>I</HI>n∣nocent Principle, in <HI>Denying the use of the Car∣nal Sword,</HI> Although it was not permitted to be recorded of <HI>suffering for the Truth,</HI> because the most numerous Party of them was guilty; But if the Reader, or any other, should come to question, whether they denyed the Use of the carnal Sword in any sense, for Proof of this, <HI>I</HI> refer such to their <HI>Wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tings,</HI> Particularly to <HI>Robert Barclay's Apology,</HI> and to the <HI>Key</HI> wrote by <HI>William Penn,</HI> Where the Reader may see that they deny the Use of the Carnal Sword in any sense, yea, even in <HI>self-preservation,</HI> or so much as in <HI>Self-Defence,</HI> such <HI>I</HI>nnocence was once maintained among them, which made <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> say, that <HI>it was their Innocent Lives</HI> and <HI>Practice that convinced him before he inspected into their Principles.</HI> The Innocent Lives of that People was the motive that convinced this pious learned man. He did not then see them lanching out Money to pay Souldiers to go and kill their fellow Creatures, nor did he see any of them making Slaves of Negroes; These and the like Practices were very remote from that Innocent and harmless People, called <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Robert Barclays</HI> convincing day.</P>
<P><HI>Negro Master.</HI> What have we to do with such far-fetch't Proofs? or what was in <HI>Barclay's</HI> Day? <HI>I</HI> love to keep at home, and the Practice of our <HI>American Christians;</HI> Are there not famous men
<PB N="17" REF="001678_0024_0FB97FE03846C4D0"/>
here among the <HI>Quakers?</HI> and yet they are both Merchants and Masters of Negroes. But I think to argue this Point a little more closely; For before the eleventh year of the eighteenth Century (which is the year thou mentionedst) that they could not be a proof in this Point, more then other Christians, because they joyned with other Sects (in the Wars against <HI>Canada</HI>) they had Negro Slaves. But I will bring you to another Instance, viz. All the Time preceeding that fore-mention∣ed Year, particularly <HI>One thousand six hundred nine∣ty two,</HI> when <HI>Andrew Hamilton</HI> was Governour of the <HI>Jersies,</HI> Did not all the <HI>Quakers</HI> refuse to pay the Souldiers to fight against the French at <HI>Albany?</HI> for the which Refual, great Havock was made of their Goods by Constables. Were not all the <HI>Quakers</HI> at <HI>Amboy</HI> strained, excepting one man that paid to maintain the Wars at <HI>Albany?</HI> And thou sayest, it was no wonder that this man afterward became a Negro-Master; For he was the first of that People that ever I heard of, that sacrificed that Innocent Principle (as thou callest it) and did pay the Rate that was raised to maintain the <HI>Albany</HI> War. Were they not all strained in <HI>Freehold?</HI> And did they not suffer in <HI>Shrewsbury?</HI> was their not a Barrel of Pork rolled out of one of their Cellers in <HI>Shrews∣bury,</HI> because they refused in any sense to have a hand in the Wars of <HI>Albany?</HI> And yet, all this Time of their <HI>I</HI>nnocence, they did not forget their Interest, but did become Negro-Masters.</P>
<P>I know Practice and Example will go a great way in <HI>Education,</HI> and why should it not go as
<PB N="18" REF="001678_0025_0FB97FE112756338"/>
far in <HI>Argument?</HI> and if it do, <HI>I</HI> have the less to do but make a short Review how <HI>I</HI> have Prove by the Practice and Example of all that diver∣sity of Sects of our <HI>American Christians,</HI> and lastly and mainly by our <HI>American Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if what I have said do not amount to perfect Proof that we may make Slaves of Ne∣gros, or any other that we can get the Mastery over, <HI>I</HI> think the <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> forever may be silent to bring in the Example and Agree∣ment of the East and West-Orthodox, to be a Proof in that Point of the <HI>Real Presence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Christians Answer.</HI> There is a good Body o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People without the Bounds of your Instance and that is the <HI>German-Quakers,</HI> who live in <HI>Ger∣man-Town</HI> near <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> Who to their re∣nowned Praise be it spoken) have above all other Sects in <HI>America,</HI> kept their Hands clean from that <HI>vile Oppression</HI> and <HI>inriching Sin</HI> of making Slaves of their fellow Creatures, the Negros, as I was credibly informed by one of themselves, and so have particular Men of all Sects kept themselves free from this inriching sin.</P>
<P>But now I come to your Instance of <HI>Ninety Two,</HI> that the <HI>Quakers</HI> were all <HI>I</HI>nnocent then, excepting one Man. This amounts to no more then this, that they were an excellent People in that day, far exceeding other Sects of <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> and yet were most shamefully overtaken with this inriching Sin, in breaking Christs Command in making Slaves of Negros, which they would be loath to be done by. Ay, but I have a further Reply to make to you upon that
<PB N="19" REF="001678_0026_0FB97FE36F2D7FD8"/>
Head (which I think will utterly overturn all that you have said upon it) The <HI>Quakers</HI> had before that Time, embraced <HI>Magistracy,</HI> which cannot be upheld without the <HI>Carnal Sword,</HI> whereby they being apostatized from their primitive Innocency and Purity, and become, in that like the rest of the World, it is no Won∣der to see them in a Practice so ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eable to it, in making Slaves of their fellow Creatures for their Gain and Advantage.</P>
<P>For it was the making Slaves of Negroes, to inrich themselves, and the embracing of Magi∣stracy, <HI>which could not be excecuted without the car∣nal Sword,</HI> which were the two pincipla Baits that Catched many of that once most Worthy People.</P>
<P>Thus far the <HI>Negro-Master</HI> and the <HI>Christian in in after Ages.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Christ an Reader,</HI> If thou hast any tender Love to that harmless Lamb, the inno∣cent Messiah, and his harmless and innocent Gospel, thou canst not but see that the ma∣king Slaves of Negros is an abominable Anti-Christian Practice. And (<HI>Christian</HI>) I will tell thee, <HI>I</HI>t will be very much if I get not a Lash with their Tongues, as they used to lash the Backs of their Slaves (and that I doubt not was with little Mercy some times) especially when there is such an Affront as this offered to their most beloved <HI>black Diana.</HI></P>
<P>There is one thing more, and then I think to take my leave at present, of our Negro-Masters, and that is, I earnestly invite them to
<PB N="20" REF="001678_0027_0FB97FE4E2CF1A30"/>
<HI>Repentance;</HI> But how to attain to their Repen∣tance, is the Question, for such a heinous sin; for they will find it to be a sin of the <HI>Second Table,</HI> that is, in plainer words a sin <HI>against God</HI> and <HI>Man both;</HI> And <HI>I</HI> am of Opinion, that such Sins cannot be repented of without <HI>Restitution</HI> made to them that they have wronged; for until the <HI>Cause he removed,</HI> I know not how the <HI>Effect should</HI> cease. But they that live and dye without making Restitution to them that they have wronged, how they can expect the Forgiveness of God, <HI>I</HI> leave this to the Reader to judge, and then they cannot blame the Writer for a false Construction. But if it should happen that a Reader should construe, that if the Negro-Masters do not make Restitution to the Negroes for the wrong that they have done them, the Forgiveness of God cannot well be obtained, and then leave it to the Negro-Masters to judge of the Consequence.</P>
<P>The next thing that comes into Considera∣tion, What and if our Negro-Masters should live and dye without making any Restitution at all, to their miserable Slaves whom they have so unjustly wronged? The Question then will be, <HI>Whether they may expect ever any Resti∣tution at all? I Answer</HI> This Question in the Affirmitive, That they may certainly expect it.</P>
<P>But for the further understanding of this Answer, I suppose then that God hath allotted unto all Mankind an <HI>I</HI>nheritance of Eternal Life, and has written their Names in the Book of Life, and this appears by the frequent men∣tioning
<PB N="21" REF="001678_0028_0FB97FE6513355E8"/>
of it in Scripture, of the blotting their Names out of the Book of Life, which could not be, except their Names were first written therein; and so all Men may expect to enjoy their Fathers Gift, the Inheritance of Eternal Life, except they forfeit the same in sinning against God, or sinning against God and Man, and then their Names are blotted out, as God said unto <HI>Moses,</HI> Him that sinneth against me, him will I blot out.</P>
<P>And now I come to the Restitution again, and say, It cannot stand with the Justice of God that the Negroes or the wronged shall have no Restitution at all; and seeing then that they must be restored of the Wrongs that they have suffered, it must be restored out of the Property of him that hath wronged them; and this Pro∣perty is his <HI>I</HI>nterest of Eternal Life; and such a proportion of this as will be equivolent to the Wrongs done unto the Negroes or any others, must go to make up this Restitution; for they will have it.</P>
<P>For they will have it made up out of your <HI>Portion in Glory,</HI> if you have any left for your selves; and if you have not, you may expect so much the more <HI>Torment;</HI> and if the Negros or Wronged have no Portion left in Glory to be <HI>increased</HI> by it, they may expect to have so much the <HI>less</HI> Torment;</P>
<P>For God will <HI>right all Wrongs,</HI> and do Justice between all his Creatures; and what is not in our Power, God doth not require, but he will not forgive what we have in our Power to amend,
<PB N="22" REF="001678_0029_0FB97FE85DB2C0B0"/>
and will not do it, so Reason says. And this is the Period of that Branch, the Doing Wrong to Man; But the other Branch, <HI>viz.</HI> The Sin∣ning against God, our Negro-Masters cannot make Restitution to God for the Sin committed against him, and therefore must Suffer the Punishment due for such a Sin; and I know no way for our Negro Masters to escape any thing of this, so long as the Attributes of God are <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> Except they <HI>Repent</HI> and make <HI>Restitution.</HI></P>
<P>But if any Negro Master should dislike any thing of this my <HI>Answer,</HI> I grant him the Liberty which I take, and that is, to answer it himself; And if they have any Truth on their side, I desire them to bring it to the open View of all Men.</P>
<P><HI>Reader,</HI> I here also present thee with the Christian Labours of another Hand, and also that <HI>Answer,</HI> called, <HI>The Athenian Oracle,</HI> first printed at <HI>London</HI> And I think to end with the saying of the Wise man, That <HI>A three- <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old Cord is not easily broken.</HI></P>

<P>Quest. W<HI>Hether Trading for Negros,</HI> i. e. <HI>carrying them out of their own Country into perpetual Slavery, be in it self Unlawful, and especially contrary to the great Law of Christianity?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ansm.</HI> Sir, After a mature and serious consi∣deration of the Question proposed, I am for the Affirmative, and cannot see how such a Trade (tho' much used by Christians) can be any way justify'd, and fairly reconciled to the Christian Law. And here, first let me propose my Reasons, and then Answer such weak Pleas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> use to be made for it.</P>
<P N="1">1. I take it to be contrary to the great Law of Nature, of doing unto all Men as we would they should do unto us; and which, as our Saviour
<PB N="38" REF="001678_0045_0FB9800B2340F2B8"/>
tells us (Mat. 7. 22. 22.) <HI>Is the sum of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the Prophets.</HI> For let us put the Case to our∣selves, and consider what it would be for a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be stolen away from his Native Country and hurryed into perpetual Bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age; Or to hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Child snatch'd from his Embraces, and so used and then see if this Trade and practice can be any way reconciled to this Rule. And surely they that have the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and yet sin against the very Laws of <HI>Nature;</HI> shall have a severe punishment at the Day of Judgment, than those poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illy Wretches that have only that di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Light to guide them. And perhaps those poor Wretches in Chains, when Death shall make them free; may rise up in Judgment, and con∣demn those more cruel and unnatural Men tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so unjustly deprive them of that Liberty which GOD and Nature had given them.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis plainly contrary to the Word of God and forbidden both in the Old Testament, and in the New; See Exod. 21. 16. <HI>He that stealth a Man and seileth him, or if be found in his hands he shall be surely put to Death.</HI> The prohibition is general; He that Stealeth any Man whatsoe∣ver, without distinction; whether one of their Brothers, or a Stranger; a meer Heathen, or a Pagan: <HI>He shall be surely put to Death;</HI> the pu∣nishment is Capital, and good reason for it. For if he that sheddeth Mans blood, by Man shall his blood be shed: surely Liberty is as dear as Life it self. Yea, he that intends to sell a Man into some kind of Bondage, would do him a greater kindness to free him from a
<PB N="39" REF="001678_0046_0FB9800D9B6B8800"/>
miserable Life. And I am well assured, this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> case of some of those poor Wretches, with a witness.</P>
<P>Again, In the New-Testament St. <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 10. joyns the Man-stealer with the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and unnatural Sinners; <HI>Murderers of Fa∣thers, and Murderers of Mothers, and Def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lers of themselves with Mankind.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Its Practice is a Disgrace to Christianity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> makes the Name of Christ to be blasphem'd amongst the Gentiles, and (in all likelihood) hinders the Propagation of the Christian Faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the World. For I am verily perswaded, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a fair and honest Trade and Commerce had been carried on amongst them, and no violence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been done to their persons: Christianity must have gotten as great footing by this time amongst them, as it has amongst the poor In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dels of <HI>New-England:</HI> Or, at least, they might have been in a great forwardness to receive that holy Doctrine; which now they hate and abominate for the sake of this practice of Chri∣stians amongst them.—And Wo be to that Person, that shall by any means hinder that blessed design for which Christ came from Heaven; and both Himself, his Apostles, and many Primitive Christians spent their dearest blood to promote; <HI>viz.</HI> to have the Mind and Will of GOD known unto the World.</P>

<HEAD>A short Answer To that part of Predestination which asserts, that Christ died for none but the elect, neither are any other redeemed and saved by him but the elect only.</HEAD>
<P>TO say that Christ dyed for none but the Elect only, and that his Death was Effectual for none but only the Elect, is a vain and ridiculous story, so long as you affirm, That from all Eternity they were elected and decreed to Salvation; such then as were made so sure of their Salvation, stood in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> need of a Saviour to die for them, as I hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall make appear. For according to the doctrine of your own Principle of <HI>Predestination,</HI> and the true consequences thereof, Christ died <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for those that were so elected, nor was there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> need of his Death upon any such account, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we conclude, that the Laws and decrees of God, are less authenticle, and more unstable then the Laws and Decrees of
<PB N="46" REF="001678_0055_0FB9802253812A00"/>
men; for the Laws and Decrees of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Persians</HI> could not be altered, see the Book of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> and if the Laws and Decrees of Earthly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so firm, sure and certain, how much more then, firm, sure and stable, are the Laws and Decrees of the great and mighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Heaven and Earth?</P>
<P>It is in vain for you to object, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> those Elect, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></HI> Adam; that says <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the purpose; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> high they had fallen Ten Thou∣sand times, it was Impossible that they could be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Wise King <HI>Solmon</HI> tells you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Seven Times, and rises again</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ah! they Fell but once in <HI>Adam,</HI> if it was so as you say it was. We know that it is a common thing among men, to forgive the first fault of Children and Youth, and they were not then come to their infant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by thousands of Years after the Fall of <HI>Adam.</HI> What, my freinds<HI>!</HI> will you make God more rigid and cruel to his Children, then earthly men are to their Children? But whether they fell or not Fell, is not the matter in debate at present, but whether the Election and Decrees of GOD, were Authentick, sure and certain, or not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the business that is here to be taken notice of and examined. Therefore either the Decrees of God are authentick, or they are not authentick, choose which you please. To say the last; <HI>viz. That the decrees of God are not sure and authentick,</HI> were most absurd and blas∣phemous. Therefore the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must be inevitably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranted. Then, Christ dyed not at all for the
<PB N="47" REF="001678_0056_0FB98023DC2F4948"/>
elect, for these who were Decreed to Salvation could never be lost, as I have already said. So then the true consequence of your doctrine of Predestination, is, that Christ dyed in vain, yea that he dyed not at, all for the elect; for the elect were secure enough without his dying for them; for so long as God is God, the De∣cree is sure and their salvation certain without the death of Christ. So then if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made such a Decree as you say he did, in vain was the Law and the Prophets, in vain was all that Christ did, and all the labours of his Apostles and all good men were to no purpose. In vain is all Reli∣gion; In vain is all your preaching, praying, singing and reading, and what else you practise. All is but lost labour. For the Decrees of God cannot be broken nor altered. Now then, accor∣ding to your doctrine of Predestination the case stands thus with every individual man and Woman, If one be decreed for perdition, let him live Never so holy and righteous a life hell and damnation is their portion, for the Decree cannot be broken.</P>
<P>Again, if one predestinate to life, should live, Never so wickedly, heaven and happiness is their portion, for the Decree cannot be altered. Is not this ric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y to reward the door of evil with good, and the doer of good with an evil re∣ward. Is not this to call light darkness, and darkness light, which is ridiculous. All which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rises naturally from your doctrine of predesti∣nation, as you hold it.</P>
<P>Is it not strange then that these absurdityes
<PB N="48" REF="001678_0057_0FB9802550ACF390"/>
and their inconsistence with God scripture and reason are not seen into and redressed. Again is it not a great dishonour to God to have the stability of his decrees questioned, as though he could not decree the elects salvation without the death of his Son? Is not this to question his omnipotency, and run him to that pinch, either to break his Decree, or then to deliver up his well beloved Son to such an ignonunious death as he under-went.</P>
<P>What! my <HI>dear Friends,</HI> must God send forth his only Son, in whom he is well pleased, to ransom from Hell, Death and Destruction, those whom he had elected from all Eternity, for that single Slip in <HI>Adam,</HI> which they knew no∣thing of? otherwise his decrees were vain, falli∣ble and insignificant, notwithstanding they were made by an Omnipotent Power from all eter∣nity. Oh! is it not a wonder that men are not ashamed of such absurd Doctrine.</P>
<P>Again, is it not a great dishonour done to JESUS Christ to say, that be died for▪ those that stood in no need of him to die for them, who were so sure of Salvation as the Predesti∣nation, Election and Decree of an omnipotent Power could make them, such wanted no Saviour to die for them, for such never were, are, nor can be lost.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>my Friends,</HI> if you think that you are that elect, or a part of that elect, it is by what is here made most plain and sufficiently evident, that you can lay no claim to Christ, nor reap any benefit by his meritorious Death
<PB N="49" REF="001678_0058_0FB98026D2487B20"/>
and Sufferings, nor expect Salvation from him; for you are sure enough without him; for as sure as there is a God in Heaven, as sure are they of Salvation whom he elects and decrees to Life from all Eternity, without the death of his Son. And therefore it is in vain for you to expect Salvation from Christ, in so doing you do but deceive your selves. You may look after God and his eternal Decree for that, and not from Christ; for if it be true, that you are in the number of that early Elect, you are sufficiently secure, blow the Storm which way it will; you need not be beholden to Christ, you do but thereby provoke God to say to you, as Christ said to his Disciples, <HI>O ye of little faith, why do ye doubt?</HI> And therefore you may make up your account with your early Decrees, and not with Christ.</P>
<P>For Christ was not concerned with you, for ye were never Lost. For the Work that Christ had to do, was to seek and to save that which was lost, and not that which was not, nor could not be lost. The certainty of which he plainly declares himself, <HI>he was not sent but to the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Sheep of the House of Israel,</HI> Mat. 18. 11. Luk. 19. 10. Mat. 10. 6. and 15. 24. and Luke 4. 18. These are his own Words; <HI>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the Poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted, To preach deliverance to the Capti∣ves, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable Year of the Lord.</HI> Read those places, with <HI>Isa.</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="001678_0059_0FB980285FC5CDE8"/>
61. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. and see if it be not true, and that you have no interest in Christ, is as clear as the noon Day which hath no clouds.</P>
<P>We see here that a part of Christs Work was to preach the acceptable Year of the Lord; and to whom he was to preach it, his own Words are very plain; and by the acceptable Year I understand, that God without respect of Persons was willing to receive into his love and favour every one that was willing to cease to do evil, and learn to do well, and believe in Christ the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssiah and Saviour of the World, who came to seek and save such as were gone astray and play'd the prodigal, with all such as he mentions. So that you see that it was none of those that were elected from all eternity; for they were safe in all weathers. But you have neither Day, Month nor Year that is ac∣ceptable to preach to any but your selves, it may be that you may understand a few more then yourselves to make up the elect, but that you know best. But this I know, that you have damned, reprobated, and made Vessels of Wrath of all mankind, if your <HI>say so,</HI> could do it, except as I have just now excepted.</P>
<P>Endless are the Absurdities that may be rais∣ed from your Principles and Doctrine. You say, the Scripture is your Rule, and the only Rule, but in effect you Rule the Scriptures, and not the scriptures you; for your Doctrine and Principles are quite another thing from the Scripture. But more especially in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Principle and Doctrine of <HI>Predestination,</HI> as is
<PB N="51" REF="001678_0060_0FB9802BEE57D0B8"/>
sufficiently evident from these few Words in answer to this one particular, <HI>viz. That Christ died for none but whom you call the Elect, and that none were nor are redeemed by him but only them.</HI> Oh! here is but little Love and Charity either to God or Man.</P>
<P>Furthermore, for you to think or say, That Christ died for those elect of whom you speak, is a grand errour, and a great mistake in you; I doubt ye have only dreamed so, and are not yet wakened out of sleep. The sign or signal is given, you may take the Alarum as you see cause, but if you be in the number of that early Elect, of which you talk, then are you sufficiently safe and secure, nothing can alarm you; but if you are not, then are you warned, so that God is clear of your blood, and so am I, as will yet further appear from what follows.</P>
<P>Neither have you any real foundation for this your assertion in holy Scripture, and I do not believe that you shall find such an expression from the beginning of <HI>Genesis</HI> to the end of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> as that, to wit, <HI>That Christ died for none but the Elect.</HI> It may be you may per∣haps find it in some old corrupt Catechism or Confession of Faith, but not in the Bible, for the whole currant of Scripture is against you therein.</P>
<P>For any that God did from Eternity elect to Life, wanted not Christ to die for them, they were such as could never wander nor go astray, being the first born of Eternity, that never
<PB N="52" REF="001678_0061_0FB9802CD46A2688"/>
play'd the prodigal, nor could they stray, being so well fenced in with a triple Wall, <HI>viz.</HI> as <HI>first,</HI> The Wall of Predestination, <HI>secondly,</HI> The Wall of Election, and <HI>lastly,</HI> The unpassable Wall of a Decree, made by an Omnipotent Power. So that neither your Elect nor you, (if you reckon your selves of that number) could never wan∣der nor go astray, so long as God is GOD, as I have already sufficiently proved. And so, for shame, never more hereafter doubt nor question God or his Decrees, left ye be turned one amongst the Unbelievers to seek sanctuary else-where, for your ingratitude and Mis-belief.</P>
<P>So that ye may plainly see and understand, that it was another Elect then you, one of a lat∣ter date then from all Eternity, That Christ was concerned with, to seek and to save, to gather, build and instruct in all things necessary to their salvation in order to eternal Life.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>my Freinds,</HI> how do yow Relish this discourse? do you not think it strange to see your selves at once turned away from both Christ and Christianity, to seek Salvation and Religion suitable to your necessity; for in Christ and Christianity you can expect neither, so long as you are in that belief, <HI>viz.</HI> That God did chuse a certain Number of Mankind to Salva∣tion, and all the rest he Reprobated and Dam∣ned, making them Vessels of Dishonour, and objects of his Wrath forever, they having do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> neither good nor evil, and that this was do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> before they were in being, how long a time it was before, no Angel nor Man can tell. As al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="53" REF="001678_0062_0FB9802E4D875548"/>
all your other Absurdities which ye hold, too tedious here to mention.</P>
<P>Again, they say, <HI>As God appointed the Elect to glory, so hath he fore ordained all the means thereunto,</HI> that is to say, he fore-ordained a Cup of Life and Salvation for the Elect, but a Cup of Death and wrath for all the rest of mankind. O Un∣charitable and Wicked Assertion! most disho∣nourable to God, and most pernicious to Man∣kind; I deny it, as most absurd, and so will God and all good Men.</P>
<P>To say, that God fore-ordained any other means for the Salvation of the Elect, then what he fore-ordained for all Mankind in general, I also deny it, as a false and vain story; for God hath freely given and granted to all Mankind (none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cepted) the benefit of Christ, who tasted Death for every man, and he is the common salvation or Propitiation. And God wills the salvation of all men, without respect of Per∣sons. And he hath no pleasure in the death of the wicked, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ezek. 33. 11. Where then is the Reprobation of all mankind, except that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that you call the Elect? Here is a very great pinch for you.</P>
<P>If God be sincere in his words, then is your story of Reprobation false, and you are found to be false witnesses against God; but God must be true in his words, and all that say other-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yars; for who will not rather be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve Gods general Declaration, then your private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ertion? but this is a little degression.</P>
<P>I say then, because Christ tasted Death for
<PB N="54" REF="001678_0063_0FB9803013AA31E8"/>
every man, and God wills the salvation of all men; These two put together, makes Salvation possible to all Mankind, and puts every one in a capacity of Life, so that not so much as one need to be lost, of all mankind; for every one that will, is wellcome to eat of the Bread of Life, and drink of the Water of Life freely.</P>
<P>And Christ himself hath promised, That whoso∣ever comes to him, he will in no wayes cast out and his call by his spirit is universal; deny it if you dare.</P>
<P>Neither is it said in holy scripture, That God so loved the Elect, but it is expresly said, <HI>God so love the World</HI> &amp;c. That is, all the People in the World, without respect of Persons, for with God there is no respect of Persons.</P>
<P>Again, for you to say, that these whom God did from all eternity (very early indeed) pre∣destinate, elect, and Decree to Life and Salva∣tion, that they stood in need of any means to Salvation, is a story as vain and ridiculous, as that other assertion (where you affirm, <HI>that Christ died for none, nor none are redeemed by him, but to Elect, only!</HI> Is not this to question Gods Varacity and Decrees? Those Elect wanted no Means no more then they wanted a Saviour to die for them, as I have made appear.</P>
<P>But what Means must you have? The death of his well beloved Son? for shame, is that the Means you want, beside that what you already have? If that be it, you are not like to have it although that be your Chiefest Means; for I tell you again, that I have already substantially
<PB N="55" REF="001678_0064_0FB98031CC2D4F40"/>
proved, that you have neither part, nor lot, or portion, nor interest in Christ, till you change our Opinion, and Imbrace the true Christian faith, till then content your selves with what security you already have, for if you be in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lumber of that early Elect, you are above the use of all means, and so consequently want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one.</P>
<P>But that I may yet make this matter a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore plain both to you and others also, I say then, have you not the Word, Hand, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal, that is, the Predestination, Election and Decree of an Omnipotent Power for your security; and they that have that, have enough, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Means is superfluous and unnecessary, there that is, nothing else is wanting, and there∣fore take notice, your incredulity is a reflection upon God, but much more upon your selves; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on you, that ye could not be content; lust his innocent Son suffer for you, and be sacrificed to your misbelief? The word of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thly King will go very far among men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great matters, and he that hath it, thinks himself secure without Hand or Seal; and were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not Impertinent, if not presumption, in any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> desire the Kings Hand and Seal to confirm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Word? Would he not take it very ill? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how much more if the death of his only son should be required for confirmation of his promise? But you have both Gods Word, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as it were Hand and Seal to confirm his promise, and yet you must have for your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the death of his Innocent Son also. You

might have relyed on his word; for on whom∣soever he bestows the noble gift or eternal Life, he will never retract his Word; for the Gifts and Calling of <HI>G</HI>od are without Repen∣tance, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 29. And now, <HI>my Freind,</HI> I must tell you, that by a wrong-Idea, dark Imagi∣nations, and false Conceptions of God, you have given a false Representation of him, very unlovely, by what you attribute and ascribe to him. By which ye have rendered the GOD of all Love and Mercy to be more cruel then the Savages of the Desart; for it is most cer∣tain, that they most carefully nourish and bring up their young ones until they bring them to perfection. And even the Sea Monsters draw forth the breasts and give suck to their young. But you say of God, that he hath destroyed all his young ones (but a few whom you call the Elect) by an eternal Decree or fore-or∣dination, an infinity of years before they were in being, by which you have denyed to all Mankind, but your selves, any benefit of Christ, or any other means whatsoever relating to their salvation. And is not this a black por∣traiture that you have drawn of the infinite goodness.</P>
<P>Now, if one were in the company of either <HI>Turk, Jews</HI> or <HI>Heathen, De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> or <HI>Atheist,</HI> and should tell them of such a story, How would they laugh and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear at such non-sence, and mock and deride Christianity. Oh! how ridi∣culous is your Principle and Doctrine? it is a wonder that you are not ashamed of it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="001678_0066_0FB9803AC522B280"/>
But it seemes the wickedness and absurdity thereof never enters your Consideration, or that the love of filthy Lucre hath blind∣ed your minds and understandings which is as a thick cloud that interposes betwixt you and the glorious light of the Sun. This cloud of Darkness and Covetousness hath too long troubled the Christian World (if not other places beside) to the great detriment and prejudice of many; and too long have you entertained very harsh and uncharitable Thoughts both of God and all Mankind (by your fruits ye are known) except your selves, or it may be a few more (as I have already said) but by the uncertainty thereof it gains the less credit with many people. But be it true or not, the case is now altered, and you are turned off from all interest and benefit of Christ, you being that early Elect; and the Pit that you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iged for others, you are fallen into it your selves, and as you have done to others, so is it done unto you.</P>
<P>True and righteous are thy Judgments, O Lord, thou King of Saints, And thou, O Lord, art free and clear of all such cruelty, partiality and respect of Persons, and thy integrity is un∣questionable; for thou hast given the ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fit of Christ to all Mankind, and if they will they may all come and eat of the Bread of Life, and drink of the Water of Life, without Money and without Price, yea, even the wickedest man that lives. The which may be matter of exceeding great and joyful <HI>News</HI> to all <HI>People</HI> upon earth (and can be nothing else but the

<P>But now, <HI>my Freinds,</HI> do not deceive your selves, and that you may not be deceived, I have News to tell you, which ye never heard of before, to wit, what ever Means God fore-or∣dained for Mans salvation, was not for your early Elect, for they were secure, as I have substantially proved; For they never play'd the Prodigal, but were always in their Fathers House, and never offended him by going astray, and all that their Father hath is theirs, but what the Father pleases to bestow upon poor prodigals, and such like necessitated Persons, of all Ranks and degrees, of all sorts and sizes whatsoever, But do not you begrudge that, for the hath enough for you and us both. Wherefore you may rest your selves contented, and I will go and try to find out the true Elect, an Elect of a later date then from all eternity, even Gods Elect for whom Christ came, and with whom Christ was concerned</P>
<P>The next thing then under consideration, is she elect that Christ was concerned with,
<PB N="59" REF="001678_0068_0FB9803D719227B0"/>
whom he came to seek and to save, whom he did and doth and shall at last gather from the four Winds of Heaven into his everlasting Kingdom. It is not those who never went astray, nor wandered from their Fathers House. It is not those who never play'd the prodigal, it is not the whole, for such need no Physitian; nor is it the Righteous, for they had no need of him; neither could it be those whom they say God from all Eternity did choose, elect and decree to salvation, for such could never go astray, as I have substantially proved. Seeing then that none of all those, nor any part of those, are that elect with whom Christ was concerned, where then be they, and who and what are they? <HI>I answer,</HI> They are such as were lost, and gone astray in the wilderness of this World, they are troubled, perplexed, and persecuted by this World; they are the wanderers up and down, whom the Men of this World think not worthy to live in it. But to be more par∣ticular, they are the poor and needy, the hungry and thrifty, and such as were heartily willing to take Christs Cross upon them, and follow him in the Regeneration. And these were chiefly such as Fishers, Tanners, Tent-makers, Shepherds and Taylo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, with other Mechanicks: As also such of all Ranks and qualities of People, as were willing to renounce this world with all the superfluous vanities th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ireof, and follow him through all difficulties into his everlasting Kingdom, and all such as did prefer Heaven to Earth, and Life eternal to life Tem∣poral,

<P>They are the sick and diseased, the Blind and the Lame, the Deaf and the Dumb, and such as were possessed of Devils; And such as were Sinners, Publicans and Prodigals, &amp;c. and such as Christ himself in that respect ha∣ving not whereon to lay their head. These were they with whom Christ was concerned, and of whom he was to gather an Elect, and to raise the fabrick of the new Creation, and a Church without spot or wrinckle, holy, harm∣less and undefiled, a Present to the Father. These are the Church that is created a new in Christ <HI>JESUS,</HI> the new Creation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King∣dom of Christ the Messias. These are the Church of which GOD did fore-know of, before the gathering of it, and every one of them he did predestinate or sore-ordain, that they all should be conform to the Image of his Son, that he, <HI>viz.</HI> Christ might be the first born among many Brethren: He the Head and Captain, and they the Members and Souldiers; He the Builder and they the Building, he him∣self being the chief corner stone thereof.</P>
<P>Now therefore God did afore-ordain or appoint, that every one of that new Creation, every stone of that new Building, every Mem∣ber of that Church without spot, every sub∣ject of that Kingdom of the Messias should be conform to Christ, their Captain, in Holiness and Righteousness, in Innocence and Meekness, in Submission and Self denyal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And every
<PB N="61" REF="001678_0070_0FB9804119B19B30"/>
one of them must purifie themselves as he is pure; otherways they could not be listed Souldiers under Christs Banner. And when all the Work of Christ is accomplished, and all his Domini∣ons and Kingdom is perfectly established and subject unto him, then shall he render it up unto the Father, and the Son himself shall be subject (or a subject of that Kingdom) and GOD shall be all in all.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>my dear Freinds,</HI> My advice to you all is, that you renounce that evil Princi∣ple, and all the absurdities thereof, and all other Absurdities that you hold, and all harsh thoughts of God, and come over to the pure Christianity, and list your selves Souldiers under Christs Banner, where you shall find Protection and a Kingdom which shall never have an end. This briefly is the true and only Means for you; This is the right Way to go in, and certain Means for all Christians to use. This is the Means which God hath fore-ordained or appointed for all that would be Heirs with Christ and fellow Citizens of the <HI>New Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you see what Means God appointed or fore-ordained for the Elect, with whom Christ was concerned: which Means is altogether useless, unnecessary and superfluous to such as were elected from all eternity. And it is my earnest desire unto the Lord, on your behalf, that your Eyes may be opened to see the things that concern the everlasting Peace and Welfare of your Immortal Souls. And as you come to apply your Minds to that divine Light, Spirit,

<HEAD>Good News to all Parents Of such Children, As die in their Infant state, &amp;c. The safety and Salvation of Children, and Idiots, sufficiently proved from Scripture and Reason, in Answer to the following Query, to wit,</HEAD>
<P><HI>SInce the holy Scripture doth so plainly declare, that they who Labour shall receive a Reward, and that must be the proper act and deed of every one of us, and without the performance thereof, there is no promise of salvation to neither Man nor Women, How then shall Children and Idiots be saved, who are not capable to labour in their Lords Vine-Yard?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. I answer, <HI>first,</HI> How they are saved, seems to be a secret not yet revealed, and secret Things belong to GOD, but notwithstanding the secrets of the Lord are with those that love and fear him, and therfore so far as our Rea∣son and Judgment is enlightened by GOD, so far may we look into that Mystery; for
<PB N="64" REF="001678_0073_0FB980464ABDC950"/>
there is nothing relating to our Salvation, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is needful for us to know, that is not either revealed, or else we are put in a capacity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> find it out our selves.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Answer.</HI> Children in their Infant-state ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> holy, harmless, innocent and righteous, other ways Christ would never have made that Compa∣rison, that those that would enter into Heaven m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st become as little Children. And in that inno∣cent state Children are not capable of any Law and where there is no Law, there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Transgression. And it is very inconsistent with the Love and Righteousness of GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> condemn any holy, innocent and Righteous Person. Neither are Idiots capable of any Law, and where no Law is, there can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Transgression. And therefore Children and Idiots are beyond the reach of Condemnation for Justice cannot take hold of them.</P>

legs; even so, both Men and Women have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and reason to go upon, but Children and Idiots have neither.</P>
<P><HI>Obj. But notwithstanding that they are not guilty in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of faith, yet by reason of their original sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will take hold of them, and condemn them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I answer.</HI> Tush! that's but a vain story, for I cannot be saved by the faith of another, neither shall I be condemned for the sin of another, for it is the deeds that I do in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that will save or damn me; for notwith∣standing that both God and Christ hath done their part, in order to my salvation, yet if I neglect to do my part, I shall be damn'd, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that both GOD and Christ hath done. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at it is the Soul that Sins that shall die, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not the Son for the Father, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch in answer to this Objection for the unde∣ceiving of the simple. So that we see when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Scripture speaks of Rewards, according to the deeds done in the body, it must be under∣stood matter of fact, and speaks to such Persons are capable to exercise their Reason and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which Children and Idiots are not, and therefore they are not concerned with those scriptures which so speak. And it were unrea∣sonable to rank them in with those to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scriptures speak.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> I answer, It is wonderful to con∣sider how far the Vertue, efficacy and power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the meritorious Acts of Christ may be ex∣tended. Our great Learned Doctors of Theologic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extend the sin of <HI>Adam</HI> to the utter most
<PB N="66" REF="001678_0075_0FBA558BE42D6210"/>
bounds of the Earth, by which all mankind are infected, even those who never knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heard of such a Man as <HI>Adam,</HI> and this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say is by Imputation, that is, God Impute the sin of <HI>Adam</HI> to all his Posterity; and if the case will stand thus, as well to those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did not, as those who did sin after the simili∣tude of <HI>Adams</HI> Transgression.</P>
<P>Others of them say, <HI>Adams</HI> sin is convey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by generation; others say, there is a seed of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> transmitted down from <HI>Adam</HI> to all his poste∣rity. But they are all of them mistaken.</P>
<P>I say then, to remedy that evil, and to me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> what <HI>Adam</HI> marred, God sent forth his Son ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of a Woman, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 4. Who himself became the great Sacrifice, Propitiation and Attonement for all the Off-spring of <HI>Adam,</HI> and tasted death for every Man, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 9. That all Man∣kind might be put in a capacity of Life. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whether these Doctors will or nill, the effici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Christs Death and Suffering will extend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣self as far and further then the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> and this makes the matter broader then it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Long. But yet, this is not all, the power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vertue of Christ is yet of a far Larger extent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the holy Apostle tells us, that by him all thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were established whether they were things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heaven or things on Earth.</P>
<P>And some are of that opinion, he went down and brake open Hells Gates and set at liberty all the damned Souls: and it doth very well consist with Reason; otherwise, to what pur∣pose went he to preach to the spirits
<PB N="67" REF="001678_0076_0FB9804A22F02EF0"/>
Prison; for if he did not set at liberty those spirits, his preaching was to no purpose, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> benefit them nothing; as also that he established the holy Angels, from falling. Such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Honour, and Dignity God hath invested <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> withal, for his Humility, Obedience and self-denyal. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2 8. 9. wherefore God hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name. So that it may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Christ, that he is God of Gods, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and next and immediate to God himself. But when he saith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Things are put under him, it is manifest that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is excepted which did put all things under him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cor</HI> 15. 27. So wounderfully far is the Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Vertue of Christ extended, without any li∣mitation, (except as is excepted)</P>
<P>And now, as concerning Children and Idiots, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what should hinder this mighty Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Vertue to extend it self (if need be) to children and Idiots, since he did shew such expressions of his Love to little Children, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> took in his Arms and blessed them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Suffer little Children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>There is no fear then that Christ will cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way such holy, harmless, righteous and inno∣cent Creatures, as little Children are. For they having so little time here, and so small a porti∣on of this World, so that in justice and equity they can never miss of Heaven, therefore we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not doubt of their salvation; for as sure
<PB N="68" REF="001678_0077_0FB9804C0B54B9F0"/>
as ever God gives any Creature a being, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he provides for its well being, things suitable its Nature, that unless the Creature forfeit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Right there unto by Transgression, which Children are not capable to do, therefore as sure as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have a beeing, as sure are they of a Reward from God, and that must be in Heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is not in Earth.</P>
<P>And as for Idiots, they seem to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> under the same circumstances with little Chil∣dren, for they have but a small portion, a little comfort in this World, therefore it see to me that nothing but heaven can make the Retaliation; and as they have a beeing, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may they expect Gods Reward; and what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that be, below Heaven and Happyness?</P>
<P><HI>Fif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly.</HI> I answer. If we seriously consider this great and mighty power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, in things relating to the Government and gathering, Instruction and protection of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church; and seeing it is so, he can easily Im∣pute or apply (if need be, as I have already hinted) his Merits to Children and Idiots whereby they may be saved.</P>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Labour in the <HI>Vine-Yard,</HI> they shall receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wages; if they will not improve their Ta∣lent, they shall have no Reward; and they that will not <HI>work in Summer</HI> may starve in <HI>Winter,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>For there is no Salvation without Regene∣ration; and No Cross, no Crown. Now it is not so with Children and Idiots, they need not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> regenerate who never were degenerate; they that are not capable of Commands and Instru∣ction are not capable to do work; but Children and Idiots are not capable of Instruction and commands, <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> I <HI>answer,</HI> If we consider the great and mighty Power of an Omnipotent Beeing, we will find no difficulty of the salvation of Children and Idiots, how that by his spirit (if they stand in need) they may be inwardly taught and instructed in all the points of Chri∣stianity and of Christ, and how he can save by the greatness of his Power, and various means which we are ignorant of, neither is it need∣ful for us to know. And tho' we may think it very strange and mysterious, yet it is but a small thing in the Eyes of him that knows how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child, even he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormeth the Mountains, and createth the Winds, and telleth unto man his Thoughts, who by his mighty Power stretched out the Heavens, and laid the Foundation of the Earth, and sets bounds to the spacious Sea, who makes the Sun, Moon, and Stars to keep their courses, who made Hea∣ven and Earth, and Seas, and all that is in them,
<PB N="70" REF="001678_0079_0FB980524DC31240"/>
great Governour of the Universe, and Captain General of all the Hosts thereof, and by the greatness of this Power it shall be made known to every one of those heavenly inhabitants, how and by what means they did attain to such unspeakable Felicity and Life eternal, whereby their joy shall continually increase, and their Hearts and Mouths filled with <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> unto the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly I answer.</HI> The will of Children and Idiots are bounded by the Will of God, neither are they free-agents until they come <HI>Gra∣dually</HI> to the use of their Reason and Sense, and while they are thus Bounded, they are free of sin and transgression, and all their Actions are according to the will of God, and not their own, so long as they are under his Tuition and Government. And we may assure our selves, that whomsoever God bounds and makes us depend upon him, he bounds all to good, so that they can do no evil, therefore it is written, <HI>he that is born of God cannot sin,</HI> or <HI>sinneth no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> And because they are not capable to love them∣selves and things temporal, more then God and things eternal, we need not fear their wellfare.</P>
<P><HI>Eightly. I answer.</HI> Children are not of that Number which need a Saviour, they want no Saviour, they never sinned after the similitude of <HI>Adams</HI> Transgression, they never went astray nor play'd the Prodigal; Children and Idiots were never sick, therefore need no Physitian; they are the righteous, whom Christ came not to call. He was not concerned with them, nor
<PB N="71" REF="001678_0080_0FB980543B7B8A00"/>
they with him. They are all Virgins, they never were defilled; and therefore they must be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>44000 which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes. They were always in their Fathers House, and never offended him; they certainly must be the 99 which never did wander. And therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there be; as some say there is, a certain Num∣ber of Mankind chosen by God, whom he from all Eternity did predestinate, Decree and elect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life and Salvation, I say, if that be true; as some affirm it is, Then may we assure our selves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be certain, that Children and Idiots are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Number that were so elected and decreed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life and Salvation; which is a great and grievous disappointment to the <HI>predesti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arian</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for they thought that they themselves were that Number that were so chosen of God, but now they may see they are not; which is heavy News and cold Comfort for them, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Warning that they may look about them in time, and consider what to do, before it is too late.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly. I answer,</HI> Children and Idiots are in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> actual possession of that which is Good, <HI>viz.</HI> Holiness, Righteousness, Innocence and Peace, of which four the Kingdom of Heaven doth consist. This Proposition I shall prove, <HI>first</HI> from Scripture, and <HI>secondly,</HI> from Reason, <HI>Deut.</HI> 23, 24. <HI>Children are Gods blessing.</HI> Psal 127. 3. <HI>Lo, Children are an heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</HI> And vers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>The Man that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath them is said to be happy,</HI> Mark, 10. 13. 14. 15. 16. And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>That Children
<PB N="72" REF="001678_0081_0FB980554D205A00"/>
are holy.</HI> If it had not been so, Christ would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have taken them up in his arms and blessed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and said, <HI>Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>They were holy. Secondly,</HI> They wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are in the actual possession of any thing, can∣not be dispossessed but by a legal decision, but Children are in the actual possession of righte∣ousness, &amp;c. against such there is no Law. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Tim,</HI> 1. 9. It is the free, and not the bounded agents that offend the Lord, and because the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are free, no force, violence nor constraint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> put upon their wills, and yet Act that which is evil, notwithstanding they have both power and knowledge to do otherwise, and to Act thus is the sin of a free Agent.</P>
<P>Now a bounded Agent cannot sin, because his will is bounded by the will of his Lord, and and the will of his Lord he knows he is bonnd to do and he willingly doth it, and consequently never blame-worthy.</P>
<P>Of this Order, Rank or Class, is all young Children and Idiots, whose will is always bound by the Will of God, untill they come to the years of discretion, and gradually receive the use of their Reason and senses.</P>
<P>At which time such as are fit for the holy War, and to work in the <HI>Lords-Vineyard,</HI> are turned out free Agents, the rest, being righteous are taken away from the evil to come. <HI>Isa.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. 1, 2. according to the good will and pleasure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him that wisely knows how to order and dis∣pose of all his Creatures, and wills the salvation of all mankind, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 4. 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 9. Whereby we may plainly and clearly see that the sal∣vation
<PB N="73" REF="001678_0082_0FB980588AD76018"/>
of Children and Idiots are after another way, and runs not directly in that Channel in which our salvation doth. For we that are free agents and come to the use of our Reason and sense, must fight the Lords Battels, labour in his Vinyard, improve our Talents, trim our Lamps, put on the wedding Garment, &amp;c. and work out our salvation, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 12. all which Children and Idiots are not capable of, as I have already said. And I say and do affirm, that life and good, and death and evil is set before all free Agents, but it is not so with Chil∣dren and Idiots.</P>
<P><HI>Tenthly. I answ.</HI> The whole Attributes of God oblige him to give a Reward to Children and Idiots, because they are his own Children; for we are all his Children by Creation, although many of us be unworthy of such a Father, and of such a high and noble Pedegree, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 18. <HI>Isa.</HI> 51. 1. For what man is there in the whole Universe that can or will cruelly and bloodily murder his own young innocent Child, he knowing it certainly to be his own? such a man then so cruel would be a monster, and not a man; nor do I think that the very worst of men would willingly and wittingly be guilty in matter of fact.</P>
<P>Again, contrary ways, what man is there among the Sons of Men, that will be so unna∣tural as not to give, his own Children a portion of his goods, according to his ability? year it is natural for the Parents to provide for their Children, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 14. And seeing the case is
<PB N="74" REF="001678_0083_0FB98059ECEF0D40"/>
so among Men, how then can we have less cha∣rity to our Lord and Maker, (the very foun∣tain it self of all Love and Goodness) then to our fellow Creature? beside what is here said, this tenth Answer is enough totally to confound original sin and eternal Reprobation, and will clear God of them both. But this is a little digression, but I am near a close.</P>
<P>Again, I say, to do no evil is to do good; and think no evil, is an Act that is good. So here is matter of fact, which is their own proper Act and deed worthy of reward. Again, they are innocent and righteous, holy and harmless, and meek and lowly in spirit, all which make up the wedding Garment, with which they are cloathed, and their Lamps trimed, and being so ready shall enter in with the Bridegroom into everlasting Bliss.</P>

<HEAD>Salvation without Outward Bap∣tism, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN the holy Scriptures, the Doctrine of the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, there is many promises of Salvation without the least mentioning of one word of water Baptism, as <HI>Deut.</HI> 28 to v. 16. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. and 33. not one word of Water-Baptism. <HI>Isa</HI> 55. 7. <HI>Mich.</HI> 6. 8. compared with <HI>Deut.</HI> 10 12. with hundreds of places to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in the Old Testament. Neither are such promises wanting in the New-Testament, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11. 28, 29, 30. compared with <HI>chap.</HI> 5. v 3. to 12. and chap. 10 v. 37, 38, 39. <HI>Mark</HI> 8. 34. <HI>Luke</HI> 9 23, 24. in all these not so much as one word of Water Bap∣tism; whereby we may plainly see that it is not the many and divers Washings or Baptisms that will do our business, in order to attain eternal Sal∣vation We must deny our selves and put on Christs Yoke, and follow him in the Regeneration, to which is annexed the Promise of Life and Sal∣vation, without one word of Water Baptism; that is, we must deny Pride, and all the Super∣fluities and vain Customs of this world, and enter the Regeneration, bearing our daily Cross, and they that are faithful until death shall then receive a Crown of Life, though they have never been baptized with Water.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 4. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. In all this Con∣ference there is not one word of Water-Baptism,
<PB N="78" REF="001678_0086_0FB9805E626ED990"/>
and yet he directs the Woman how she might attain Salvation; he neither bids her go to the Priests, nor yet to his Disciples, nor yet to <HI>John</HI> to be baptized with water, but in plain words tells her how she may be saved. The Woman taken in Adultery, whom Christ did absolve, he gave her no command to be baptized with Water, but like a harmless Lamb, in a few words, shows her the only true way to Salvation, <HI>Go and sin no more.</HI> And it is very observable, that of the Mul∣titude whom he cured, he never directed one of them to be baptized with Water, as well knowing how insignificant that sign or ceremony was to Sal∣vation, and therefore himself baptized none with water, nor yet so much as once makes mention of it in all his long and unwearied Preachings. Again, the man that was blind from his Birth, <HI>John</HI> 9. whom Christ cured, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e neither commanded, coun∣selled nor advised him to water-baptism, who for his noble and valiant testimony to Christ was by the proud Priests and learned Rabbies of the <HI>Jews</HI> cast out of their Society. In this distress Christ finds him out, and takes him into his, upon his acknowledgment of his Belief, <HI>vers</HI> 38. By which it plainly appears, that Salvation is annexed to be∣lieving, to all that are under the Gospel Dispen∣sation. And it will be yet more clear and plain if these Passages of Scripture be duly considered, <HI>Mark</HI> 1. 15. The first thing that Christ preached was, <HI>Repent and believe the Gospel.</HI> And <HI>John</HI> 5. 24. and 6 29. <HI>This is the work of God, that ye do believe.</HI> Mark 9. 23. <HI>All things are possible to him that believes.</HI> Then is Salvation possible without outward Bap∣tism. And <HI>John</HI> 16. 16. <HI>He that believeth shall be
<PB N="79" REF="001678_0087_0FB9805FDA74A4E0"/>
saved. John</HI> 3.15,16,17,18. and <HI>vers.</HI> 36. and 6.35. <HI>v.</HI> 40. and 11.25. and 14. 12. and 20. 31. Oh! how great is the strength of true Belief!</P>
<P>Now, every one of these Citations (with many more besides) have a faithful Promise of Salvation annexed to every one of them, by him that could not lye, without the least regard had to Water-Baptism; nor have they relation to Water-Bap∣tism, neither have these Promises any dependance upon it; which evidently appears from <HI>Peter'</HI>s own confession, <HI>Acts</HI> 10. 34,44. These having re∣ceived the true Baptism, there was no more need of any sign or ceremony of Water, since they had received the substance; for as the Day breaks the Shadows fly away; neither had <HI>Peter</HI> any command in all his Commission so to do, nor to use any <HI>Jewish</HI> Rites or Ceremonies among the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> the truth of this will yet further appear from the Instructi∣ons of the whole Church of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> who was the great Apostle of the <HI>gentiles,</HI> declares in plain words, That he had no Commis∣sion to baptize with Water.</P>
<P>But now look back to <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. and <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. from whence, they say, they have their Commission for Water-Baptism; but I deny there is any Command in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. for water Baptism, nor yet in <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. nor any men∣tion made there of Water-Baptism; for their Salvation and Damnation is annexed to Believing or Dis-believing the Gospel, without any depen∣dance on Baptism, unless it be the true one that purges away all sin, but Water-Baptism cannot purge away one sin, so insignificant is it to Salva∣tion; and therefore down falls to nothing that new
<PB N="80" REF="001678_0088_0FB9806152A31E40"/>
Assertion, <HI>viz. No promise of Salvation without Wa∣ter-Baptism.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19 16. there came one to Christ, and said, <HI>Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal Life?</HI> Christ said unto him, <HI>If thou wouldst enter into Life, keep the Commands, and sell that thou hast, and give to the Poor, and thou shalt have Treasure in heaven, and come and follow Me.</HI> Here is a most sure and certain Promise of Salvation without Water-Baptism, back't with two Wit∣nesses more, to wit, both <HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>Luke, Mark</HI> 10. 21. besides his former Instructions, Christ bids him take up his Cross and follow him. The same Instructions are recorded in <HI>Luke</HI> 18. 18. And this three-fold Cord is not easily broke, and a four-fold Cord is yet more stronger; for there is both Christ and the three Evangelists that are one entire Te∣stimony, That by keeping Gods Commands, by dispossessing our hearts and affections of the world by true belief, and taking up the Cross (for No Cross, No Crown) and following the Example of our blessed Saviour, to all which is annexed most sure and certain Promises of Salvation, without Water-Baptism; for if it had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o needful to Salvation as this new coyned Argument would have us to understand, Christ would never have omitted the propagation of it, all the while he taught on earth. I say, this new coyned Argument or Assertion (or rather a dream of some dark Imagination to maintain self-Interest) is so smooth and cunningly devised, that in the ears of ignorant People it passes for good Coyn unquestioned, and makes the simple believe they
<PB N="81" REF="001678_0089_0FB98062CAA6B710"/>
have gotten that which indeed they have not got, which is very detrimental to the advancement of Christs Kingdom here upon earth.</P>
<P>And therefore <HI>my dear Friends and Brethren,</HI> If interest were set aside, and the true Baptism preached and propagated through the world, I mean the baptism of the holy Ghost, that puri∣fies and cleanes the heart, and burns all sin, and makes the old Fabrick a new Creation, a fit Temple for God to dwell in, this is the Substan∣tial Baptism, which hath the certain Promise of Salvation to all that receive it, and abides in the operation of it, without the Sign or Cere∣mony of Water Baptism. And how beneficial would this be to both the learned and unlearned. O! how it would advance the Interest and king∣dom of Christ upon earth. And so all the Lovers of God and seekers of his Glory, the good of their Neighbour, and the eternal well-being of their Immortal Souls, would become Preachers of Righ∣teousness, either in words or actions, and some in both, till the earth were full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Seas, <HI>Isa.</HI> 11. 9. The Air would become temperate, the blustering Winds moderate, the mighty Raging and Roar∣ing of the Seas calmed, and the extreams of Heat and Cold abated, and the Earth be like Pa∣radise, and all Creatures would rejoyce in the goodness of the Lord; <HI>Isa.</HI> 55. and chap, 65. 16. to the end; and so no more great Sums of Money paid for preaching, for all would be taught of God. And great will be the Peace of that day.
<PB N="82" REF="001678_0090_0FB980650F1FBFF8"/>
To further on this blessed state is to help the Lord against the mighty, not with carnal but spiritual weapons, for the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God. But to turn to a conclusion from this digression, I say, to conclude this Brief consideration, I think, I may safely say of Water baptism, as the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> said of cir∣cumcision, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 19. saith he, neither circum∣cision nor uncircumcision avails any thing, but keeping Gods commands; so it is neither the ha∣ving, nor the wanting of Water baptism that makes a true Christian, but a new creature, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 19. compare with <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 7. and 5. 6. for without the regeneration of all that is degene∣rate, there is no Salvation, nor entrance into Gods Kingdom.</P>
<P>And therefore since Christ and his Apostles were the true Presidents and Patterns of Christianity, it must Inevitably follow from thence▪ that all the Articles of the Christian faith were comman∣ded and practised by Christ and his Apostles: But baptism with water, in the Name of the Father, Son and holy Ghost, was neither comman∣ded nor practised by Christ nor his Apostles, and therefore is no article of the Christian faith among us Gentiles And as those other Arguments from Scripture, so this last from Reason, is most infallibly true and certain.</P>

<HEAD>What sins we are to Remit, and what we are not to Remit, are clearly and plainly Resolved in answ▪ to the following Questions.</HEAD>
<P><LABEL>Quest. 1.</LABEL>
A<HI>Re we Obliged to remit or forgive all Injuries done against Our Person, Property or Reputa∣tion, without Repentance or Retaliation, if it be in the power of the Injurer?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> All Injuries ignorantly and undesign∣ingly done by the Injurer, against our Person or Reputation, we are obliged to Remit without Repentance; but Injuries against our Property are not to be remitted without Retaliation or Re∣stitution, if it be in the power of the Injurer. For the first of these, we have a President from Christ and his Followers, <HI>Luke</HI> 23 34 <HI>Acts</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 60. but for the last I know no President; but Injuries designedly done by the Injurer against our Person, Property or Reputation, are not to be Remitted without true Repentance, as also the Restitution or Reparation of that part of our Property in which we were injured; We may, if we please, Remit all Injuries whatsoever without Repent∣ance or Restitution, but we are not bound to do it, by any Law or Command that I know of; for if God should command us to Remit all Injuries<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without either Repentance, Retaliation or Resti∣tution,
<PB N="84" REF="001678_0092_0FB9806F04322C48"/>
then he himself i hereby obliged to do the like, for Examples sake; for Christ faith, <HI>If we forgive Men the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Trespasses, our heavenly Father will forgive our Trespasses;</HI> and if so, where is the Dam∣ned and Reprobated Persons? For if all Offences be Remitted both by God and Man, then no Hell nor Damaution; to assert which were absurd, and repugnant both to Scripture and Reason; for true and unfeigned Repentance is the Foundation Ground or Pillar upon which Forgiveness or Re∣mission is built, to which God, Scripture and Reason do agree.</P>
<P>Now if we are to Remit, as is already said, then it be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oveth us to know from what sort of Ignorance these Offences and injuries do pro∣ceed; for there is two sorts of Ignorance, <HI>viz.</HI> one sort of Ignorance is not in our power to help, as for instance, We behold the glorious Sun, Moon and Stars, but we cannot tell what Matter they are made of. The second sort of Ignorance is that which God hath put in our power to help, by the assistance of his Grace and Spirit, which he never with-draws from none, no, not the worst of men, so long as he alloweth them to breathe on his earth. So that our Negligence, Unwatchfulness and Mis∣improving our Talent is all our own Fault, and therefore the Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, <HI>That when you might have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of others, you have need of one to teach you the first Principles of the Oracles of God, Heb.</HI> 5. 12. For, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the first sort of ignorance we are not accountable; for our God commands us no∣thing but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t is possible for us to do; but for the last sort of Ignorance, we are and must be account∣able
<PB N="85" REF="001678_0093_0FB980704D4BB790"/>
which puts us all upon our uttermost Dili∣gence in a Search after Wisdom; for ignorance will be no Excuse in matters that we might have known, or ought to know. So that from this last sort of ignorance must proceed all the Offences and Injuries that we are to Remit. And this brings me to a second Question.</P>
<P><LABEL>Quest. 2.</LABEL>
Those <HI>Jews</HI> which crucified Christ, was it not in their power to know that they did evil in so doing? or was it in their power to know? If the first, how could they be condemned for their utter inability? If the last, how comes it to pass that Christ prayed for Pardon of those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins which these <HI>Jews</HI> either knew, or might have known them to be sin?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It cannot be the sins of Knowledge that Christ prayed be to forgiven; see what is said against such Wickedness, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3. <HI>The sins of the House of</HI> Eli <HI>shall no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e purged with Sacrifice, &amp;c.</HI> Neither could it be Willful sins that Christ pray'd might be Remitted; For Willful sins there re∣mains no Sacrifice, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 26. Neither could it be Presumptuous sins that Christ prayed might be Forgiven; for that seems to be a greater sin than either of the two former, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 23 <HI>Psal.</HI> 19. 13. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 10. Neither could it be the sin of that sort of Ignorance which is not in the power of Man to help, which Christ prayed for the Re∣mission of, for that could produce no sin, as I have already hinted; for our God is so righteous, so just, so merciful and loving a Father to all his Creatures, that he will not charge them with <HI>I</HI>m∣possibilities,
<PB N="86" REF="001678_0094_0FB98071E24CA7A8"/>
no more than he will o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can cease to be God. Nor do <HI>I</HI> think that Christ levelled his Petition against any of these four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins, but only against our careless, sloathful and negligent im∣provement of these divine Gifts and Graces which we have received of God to work out our Salva∣tion by.</P>
<P><LABEL>Quest. 3.</LABEL>
But if Christ did himself remit, and also prayed to God that he also would remit those Sns of Igno∣rance, which these <HI>Jews</HI> did commit in cruci∣fying of Christ; and if we are bound by the Ru∣les of Christianity to follow Christs Example, will not this Doctrine open a door to a careless and ignorant way of living; and he that is most Ignorant may Lay claim to the greatest Privi∣ledge in Remission, and so plead Christs Exam∣ple therein? Here is a pinch indeed.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> What sins we are to remit, and what sins we are not to remit, I refer to the fore-part of the <HI>Answer</HI> to the first Question; as also, if all Offences and Injuries were to be remitted, both by God and Man, then would there not be lost one of all the Off-spring of <HI>Adam;</HI> and conse∣quently, neither Hell nor Reprobation; This I also refer to the Answer of the first Query. And now, to shut up close that open door to a Libertine kind of life, let all People know (if there be any such as do not know) that God is a free Agent, and may, if he please, remit all sins and Offences whatsoever done against him, but without true and unfeigned Repentance, and forsaking the evil, and cleaving to that which is
<PB N="87" REF="001678_0095_0FB98073807E6B48"/>
good, there is neither Precept, President nor Example for any such thing in all the holy Scriptures, that I know of; but on the contrary it is expresly said, <HI>That GOD by no means will clear the guilty, but will render a Reward to every one according to their deeds,</HI> Exod. 23. 7. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 34. 7. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 8. 2. <HI>Cor..</HI> 5. 10.</P>
<P>And as for <HI>Man,</HI> he being made in the likeness of God, he also is a free Agent, and may, if he please, remit all Offences and injuries done against him, but he is not bound to do so, by any Law or Command, as I have already said. These two joyned together, do make such a strong Bolt to bar that Door, that there can be no entrance there to any Libertine kind of life. Therefore let none presume to offend or dishonour God, or disgust and injure their Neighbour, and so pre∣tend their Ignorance was the cause; but let such remember, that it is said, there is no Dark∣ness nor shadow of Death where the workers of Iniquity can hide themselves, <HI>Job.</HI> 34. 21, 22. <HI>Chap.</HI> 31. 4. And <HI>the Eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the Earth, beholding the evil and the good, Prov.</HI> 15. 3. <HI>Job.</HI> 34. 21. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16. 9.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there was a time of Ignorance, in which it is said <HI>God wincked at, but now he commands all to repent and turn to their Maker,</HI> he having given a more fuller and clearer dispensation then what he had formerly done.</P>
<P>And therefore none need to pretend Ignorance, for every one hath Light and Grace sufficient, it they will make use of it, to rule and regulate their Life and Conversation by.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="001678_0096_0FB98075A1658B98"/>
Now may it not be supposed, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se times of Ignorance at which God winked, (here spoken of by the Apostle <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 17. 30.) commenced from <HI>Adams</HI> Fall, to the Resurrection of Christ, or rather among the <HI>Gentiles</HI> from the begin∣ning of Idolatry, till that time that <HI>Peter</HI> was sent to <HI>Cornelius</HI> the Centurion, who was a <HI>Gentile,</HI> and having received his Commission, after he had seen the vision of the Sheet that was let down from Heaven by the four Corners thereof, which things done, <HI>Peter</HI> neither makes Objection nor Delay to proclaim and preach the Gospel of Christ to and among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> which was glad Tidings to all <HI>Christians,</HI> and put an end to those times of Ignorance at which God wincked, <HI>Acts.</HI> 17. 30.</P>
<P>Now the Certainty and Circumstances of this Commission makes that in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. the more doubtful; for if that be certain, as some sup∣pose, then what need was there either of <HI>Peters Vision</HI> or Commission, <HI>Acts</HI> 10 11. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs</HI> And thus the Partition Wall that was betwixt <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> is totally broken down, according to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ters</HI> own words, <HI>Act,</HI> 10. 34. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And therefore he that is the great LORD both of <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> without respect of Persons, commands all men every where to Repent of the evil, and turn to the good, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55. 7. without which there is no Promise of Salvation to neither Man nor Woman; for no Cross, no Crown.</P>
<P>So having said what I think needful, in an∣swer to that Question, easing of that Pinch, and barring of that pretended Door, I shall shut
<PB N="89" REF="001678_0097_0FB98077B2283D90"/>
up this breif Discourse, in the words of the Prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> 30. 33. <HI>Tophet is ordained of old for the King, it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the Pile thereof is fire and much Wood, the breath of the Lord like a stream of Brimstone doth kindle it.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if the Love of God and a serious Consi∣deration of these Words, do not fright and deter People from sinning, such must needs be in a miserable Condition; For if this do it not, I know not what else will <HI>do it;</HI> however, here is mentioned the final Doome in the <HI>future</HI> state, most Impartially, to Rich and Poor, High and Low, Noble and Ignoble, and to all the Workers of Iniquity.</P>

<P>AS I would not be sound in Flattery, so I would not be Remiss in my Duty in giving this Author his true value, who, when thou hast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead his Treatise, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eest what a high esteem and tender Regard he had of the glory of GOD, and the Everlasting well∣being of the Souls of all Men, thou canst not but esteem him to have been a worthy Author; for in the place where he was known, his pious innocent Life and Practice did bespeak his worth far above all the Commendations that a Post-script can give of him. But unto strangers that knew him not, I honestly declare unto them, for harmlessness and Innocency, within the bounds of my knowledge, I know not his fellow upon Earth, excepting one other Man; and he hath left this Mite of his as a Token of his Love he had to the Sons and Daughters of <HI>Adam,</HI> and for the benefit and well-being of their Immortal Souls. And he was a diligent Searcher into the innocent and harmless Prin∣ciples of Christianity, and also of the many Absurdities, Falshoods and Errors that were crept into the Name of the Christian Faith,
<PB N="91" REF="001678_0099_0FB9807A0B1514F8"/>
and particularly this of Reprobation, that ever God did Reprobate any of his Creatures, espe∣cially his Creature Man, who was made in his own Image; this assertion being so dishonourable to God and pernicious to his Creature Man, he lookt upon this to be a Monster, and so hath used his Christian endeavour in its Detection.</P>
<P>And if any <HI>Predestinarian</HI> should pretend to answer the Labours of this worthy Author, I desire them to tell the world whether Man be not a free Agent, that is to say, man hath a free Will to pitch upon his own Choice in things relating to his Salvation or Condemnation, either by his Creator or by any other secondary Causes produced by Omnipotency, to frustrate him of his free choice? And whether or no God hath not furnished out his Creature Man by his Grace, compleatly, whereby he is in enabled to perform his Creators Requirings, yea or nay? And if not, why doth God require of his Creature Impossi∣bilities? Or whether he be made a bounded Agent, according to this following Example.</P>
<P>I suppose that a Carpenter with great pains and labour did make a Cart-wheel, and when he had made it, gave it a command to get up and run towards the Sun rising; it having no Power given it, it naturally lies still, and diso∣beys its Makers command; and then the Car∣penter under the pretence of its Disobedience, to show his power over his Creature, should violently fall upon his Wheel and dash it to pieces. If there were any such man as this to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found, how would wise Men deride him for
<PB N="92" REF="001678_0100_0FB9807B99A15338"/>
his Folly and Madness? Now I desire to know if they see any such betwixt God and his Crea∣tures?</P>
<P>These things, and many more of the like nature, I must be Resolved in before I yeild up the Cudgels, and my self a Captive to <HI>Predesti∣narians.</HI></P>

<P>I Have seen thy Book, called, <HI>The Fallacy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Quakers;</HI> in which thou asserts, Christ
<PB N="93" REF="001678_0101_0FB9807D234E4CB0"/>
Baptism to be with Water; and if so, I desire thee to Resolve me some Difficulties, <HI>viz.</HI> No Man is bound to believe any Article of Faith, but what was commanded by Christ, and practised by his Apostles; but Baptism with Water was not com∣manded by Christ, nor practised by the Apostles in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. By which I argue▪ This can be no Article of the Christian Faith. But in <HI>pag.</HI> 9, 10. thou sayst, it is commanded, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. and 19. because the Teaching there commanded was outward, and so the Baptism, there com∣manded, was such as they were capable of admi∣nistring, which was with Water; but the Baptism or giving of the holy Ghost, was not in their power, for that was the Prerogative of Christ; so I must believe this Consequence, That Water was intended, though not incerted to be an Ar∣ticle of Faith.</P>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Answer.</HI> This indeed, seems weighty, if it was not for the Pen-Man of the 8th Chapter of the <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 17, 18. where he tells us, <HI>That Simon Magus seeing that by laying on the Hands of the Apostles, the holy Ghost was given,</HI> &amp;c. But if thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilt give a Consequence for Faith, thou must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke a Consequence. Well then, I'll suppose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Consequence to be true for once. <HI>viz.</HI> That Christ commanded his Apostles to baptize with Water, in the Name of the Father, and of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and of the holy Ghost. Now I desire to know where they practised this Command, <HI>viz.</HI> Water-Baptism in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, which
<PB N="94" REF="001678_0102_0FB9808406E5D6B0"/>
was the Baptism commanded by Christ; and if thou canst not show this, thou must say they disobeyed the Command of Christ, and did in∣troduce and practise another Baptism of their own Contrivance, which was not the Baptism of Christ. And if so, by the Parity of Reason, we may on as good Grounds believe, that they have introduced another Gospel, which was not the Gospel of Christ; and then, I pray, what vali∣dity is in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. And here's a Consequence for thee to believe, and I think on as good Grounds as thy Consequence, That Water's there inten∣ded, although it be forgot to be mentioned. And if the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> can imbrace a Human Invention without a Primitive President, in Scripture, for their Practice, how can they blame others for the same of Infant Baptism?</P>
<P>Now if these things be Resolved fairly and rationally, I shall for the future be obliged to the Resolvers or Resolver.</P>
