<L>When bravery broke the British tyrant's chains,</L>

<L>To snatch them both from poverty and pain.</L>
<L>In Boston port a gallant ship was found</L>
<L>Well man'd and laden, to Genoa bound;</L>

<LG>
<L>But now head winds less rapid progress gave,</L>
<L>The ship hard lab'ring through the adverse wave,</L>
<L>A storm arose—and just beneath the deck</L>
<L>Our main-mast went, and left our ship a wreck.</L>

Swift came the boats with fierce barbarians mann'd,</L>
<L>Took full possession, and the crew enchain'd;</L>
<L>A barb'rous wretch whose heart ne'er sympathiz'd,</L>
<L>Than whom the tyger is more civiliz'd,</L>
<L>A wretch through fear (and not respect) obey'd</L>
<L>This hoard of pirates train'd to plunder—led.</L>
<L>Meantime a torpid frenzy seiz'd my mind,</L>
<L>While pious Musselmen my limbs confin'd,</L>
<L>Then as unfeeling butchers handle goats,</L>
<L>But with less care, they threw us in their boats;</L>
<L>Close to the lofty hostile frigate row'd,</L>
<L>And there in haste their fetter'd slaves unload.</L>
<L>When sense return'd, I try'd to contemplate</L>
<L>The four-fold mis'ries of my present state.</L>
<L>Broad on my back, and fetter'd to the deck,</L>
<L>Huge iron chains embrac'd hands, feet and neck;</L>
<L>While from the zenith Sol's bright burning rays</L>
<L>Pour'd unobstructed full upon my face;</L>
<L>Now two long days and nights a prey to grief,</L>
<L>Food, drink, nor sleep, ne'er came to my relief,</L>
<L>'Till one more kind, with scanty crust of bread</L>
<L>My craving appetite in mercy led.</L>
<L>Thus three whole weeks I journey'd on the main</L>
<L>Scorch'd by the sun and delug'd by the rain,</L>
<L>Until full fraught with wealth, toward Algiers</L>
<L>With flowing sails at length the frigate steers.</L>
<L>Now as we roll'd, our grief afflicted eyes,</L>
<L>Which bolts and chains had fix'd upon the skies,</L>
<L>Far in the east upon the azure tide,</L>
<L>In hostile pomp, a lofty ship espy'd,</L>
<L>From whose tall mizzen-yard, than snow more white</L>
<L>A Gaulic ensign was unsurl'd to sight;</L>

Now transient pleasure beam'd in ev'ry eye,</L>
<L>And whisper'd, wish'd for liberty was night;</L>
<L>Transient indeed—sent only to prepare</L>
<L>Our hapless minds for more complete despair.</L>
<L>The boatswain's pipe convey'd the shrill alarms,</L>
<L>And call'd each bloody Mussulman to arms;</L>
<L>Urg'd by the gale the ships each other near'd,</L>
<L>Alike for battle, and for blood prepar'd;</L>
<L>In warlike pomp they o'er the billows ride,</L>
<L>And place anon their thunders side by side,</L>
<L>With mutual fury each the foe attacks,</L>
<L>And kill'd and wounded soon bestrew the decks,</L>
<L>Broadside on broadside, each incessant pour'd</L>
<L>And one continued peal of thunder roar'd,</L>
<L>Round, grape, and langrage, bar, and chain shot too</L>
<L>From cannon's mouths in swift succession flew;</L>
<L>Heads, legs, and arms in wild confusion lay,</L>
<L>And clouds of smoke obscur'd the face of day;</L>
<L>Each fore and aft the foe alternate swept,</L>
<L>And crimson tears the full fraught scuppers wept.</L>
<L>Here death in hideous aspect stalk'd about,</L>
<L>Review'd the lines, and mark'd his victims out;</L>
<L>At length (by hell assisted) in the 'fray,</L>
<L>The pirate cut each Gaulic mast away;</L>
<L>And fore and aft for three long hours and more,</L>
<L>His utmost vengeance on the wreck did pour;</L>
<L>Whose boatswain's mate led on the gallant crew,</L>
<L>Amounting now to only thirty-two,</L>
<L>Who all resistance now conceiving vain,</L>
<L>And death preferring to a tyrant's chain,</L>
<L>Seiz'd the last sad resource, that deep despair</L>
<L>Had left, and blew the frigate in the air.</L>

Meantime confusion walk'd the pirate's deck,</L>
<L>His men half slain, his ship a scatter'd wreck:</L>
<L>Here lay a sail, and there a top-sail-yard,</L>
<L>And dying groans throughout the ship were heard;</L>
<L>While setter'd slaves grew frantic with the fright,</L>
<L>Expos'd unshielded to this dreadful fight;</L>
<L>Of all our hapless crew to grief a prey,</L>
<L>Myself alone surviv'd the dismal day;</L>

<L>But why should I the mournful tale prolong,</L>
<L>And tire the Muse thus with a pensive song?</L>
<L>Suffice to say, from all her rubbish clear'd,</L>
<L>With rigging temporarily repair'd,</L>
<L>For Barbary's coast once more the frigate steer'd.</L>
<L>The winds were prosp'rous, and within a week</L>

<L>NOW gentle reader, think thy task not hard</L>
<L>Awhile to listen to a sable bard,</L>
<L>Whose pen undaunted thus shall dare address</L>
<L>A world of critics, and her thoughts express,</L>
<L>Th' envenom'd source of every ill to trace,</L>
<L>That preys incessant on his hapless race;</L>
<L>And trump the inconsistency of those</L>
<L>Feign'd friends to liberty, feign'd slavery's foes;</L>
<L>From that piratic coast where slavery reigns,</L>
<L>And freedom's champions wear despotic chains;</L>
<L>Turn to Columbia—cross the western waves,</L>
<L>And view her wide spread empire throng'd with slaves</L>
<L>Whose wrongs unmerited, shall blast with shame</L>
<L>Her boasted rights, and prove them but a name.</L>

<L>To call forth all the vices of the cane,</L>
<L>Confusion's sire, and friendship's mortal bane;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If we trace matters to their source, we shall find that the cultivation of the Cane has been productive of more bloodshed and misery to mankind, than any other modern circumstance. In order to attain this object, the thick settled Indies were depopulated, to make room for a race of slaves obtained by exciting wars, massacres, and every species of devastation among the quiet inhabitants on the coast of Africa. Thousands of those have perished on their passage; other thousands after their arri∣val; and' what was wanting to fill up the measure of iniquity, has been supplied by whipping and starvation. And when to these, we add the numerous instances of women being reduced to beggary, children to want, and men to brutes, by the per∣nicious use of spirituous liquors, drawn from the same source (the sugar cane.) Stoicism itself, must shudder. Of the legal trade of kidnapping, the humane treatment on board guineamen, and the sympathetic conduct of whippers, overseers, &amp;c. I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.</NOTE></L>

To introduce luxurious rules of art,</L>
<L>To sink the genius and enslave the heart,</L>
<L>To make mankind in vicious habits bold,</L>
<L>By bart'ring virtue for the love of gold.</L>
<L>For these, old Europe's fleets first cross'd the flood,</L>
<L>And bath'd the coast of Africa in blood;</L>
<L>Far these, her sons have rob'd the world of peace,</L>
<L>And sluie'd the veins of half the human race;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Witness millions of the natives of both Indies, wantonly sacrificed by the Spaniards, French, Dutch, Portuguese and British. To say nothing of the unhappy Africans, whose sea∣coasts have for more than two hundred years been the theatre of wars, massacres, &amp;c. instigated by speculators in flesh and blood for the sole purpose of procuring slaves, by purchasing prisoners from all parties; yet the perpetrators of those enormities, their heirs and assigns, appeal to the mandates of heaven for justification.</NOTE></L>

<P>IN the first movements of the American Revolution, it was insisted, and generally accepted as a given point, that all men by nature are equal; and this truth is the foundation of all Liberty. It was upon this principle, that our Conventions endeavor∣ed to form both the State and Federal Constitutions: But as eminent a monument of human wisdom as the Federal Constitution may be, it yet contains a certain clause, which the benevolent mind can never contem∣plate, but with detestation.</P>
<P>"The migration, or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress, prior to the year 1808." A short paraphrase on this remark∣able clause, perhaps may read nearly as follows:</P>
<Q>Although our Constitution is built on principles, which have for their basis the perfect equality of man: Although we hold that freedom is the birth∣right of every individual of the human race, what∣ever

may be his country, or his color: Although we maintain that no person has any legal authority over another, but what is derived from the voluntary con∣sent of the person over whom it is exercised: Al∣though we believe that when one person attempts to usurp authority over another, that it is not only the right, but the duty of the injured person to re∣sist: Although we hold that tyranny is the greatest of curses and vices; and that liberty is the greatest of blessings—Yet we believe, that the Negroes of Af∣rica, because they are black, and we are white—be∣cause it is necessary for us to live in genteel refine∣ment, at the expense of the misery of the stupid negroes—because liberty and property are our rights, and ne∣cessarily extinguish theirs: We therefore maintain it to be perfectly right and just, to keep them and their chil∣dren to languish in hopeless bondage, without the least right or title to the profits of their labor, or the liberty of their persons; and that whenever they make the least attempt to resist our authority, or to regain their liberty, to punish them, or put them to death, as the case may require. And that whereas there are not enough of these wretched victims in the United States, this land of liberty and equality; (Though there are near seven hundred thousand) we will not prohibit, but will virtually gurantee the slave trade, that is we will allow our merchants and our sailors to go to the defenceless shores of Africa, and either by fraud or violence, or whatever way you can, seize upon the wretched natives, (though as innocent as to any injury they ever did us, as the an∣gels are in Heaven) take fathers, aged trembling fa∣thers,

from their wretched starving children!— Weeping children, from their agonizing parents!— Husbands from their shrieking, distracted wives!— Wives from the embraces of their tender wishful husbands! Lover and friend, from his wished for mate! Take them men, women and children, load them with irons, and crowd them promiscuously into a stifled stinking hole. There feed them on their passage with the bread of affliction—if they are sullen perhaps you may knock them in the head, and throw their mangled bodies to the sharks! When you have arrived in the free zone of America, that assylum of the oppressed, immediately advertise that you have a cargo of human beings for sale; when the purcha∣ser arrives, let him examine them as critically, and with as much decency as if they were oxen, or cows, then let him take them to his plantations, and assign to each his burden. Let them toil incessantly in in the burning summer's fun. Let them shiver with naked∣ness in the rigorous and inclement winter. Let the cruel the unfeeling task-master raise them by the break of day, with the crack of his whip. Let its discipline be extended over them during the day, and for a small fault or mistake, let their backs be 'whipt to a jelly. Let the aged female while bending over her spade, and worn out with enormous hard∣ships, be spurred on to a nimbler pace by the cruel whip. Let a small portion of Indian corn, a few yams or potatoes, be their principal food, whilst ema∣ciated with hunger, and exhausted by ceaseless and 'nsupportable labor, 'til death the often implored 'and most welcome messenger, preaches to them the principles of equality indeed.</Q>
