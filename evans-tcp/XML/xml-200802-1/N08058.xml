<P>THE AUTHOR makes his kind Acknow∣ledgements to the Congregation—accepts their kind and genteel Request of a Copy, as a Token of their Respect, Gratitude, and Appro∣bation of his short Labours among the Living, and Dying, in Word, Doctrine and Prayer, in that Time of sudden and alarming Distress; and earnestly wishes, the Perusal may serve to excite, and promote, that serious Tho'tfulness, which was so visible upon that Occasion.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the follwing Discourse may probably fall in∣to the Hands of Some, not acquainted with the special Occasion, on which it was preached; 'tis apprehended the following brief Account may not be im∣proper. The joyful News of the Repeal of the <HI>Stamp Act,</HI> arriving while the General Assembly were sitting in this Town, they thought fit to direct that the two Military Companies in the Town, should be raised, and the Cannon fired, &amp;c. at the public Expence. In Pursuance of this Order, on the <HI>23</HI>d of May, a large Quantity of Powder was removed from the Colony's Store, into the New-Brick School-House, to be deliver∣ed out to the Soldiers and used for other Purposes, on this Joyful Occasion. A Number of Young Gentlemen meet in the Chamber of the House over the Room where the Powder was deposited, to prepare Sky-Rockets, &amp;c. to be played off in the Evening. In delivering out the Powder to the Soldiery, a considerable Quantity was scattered on the Ground round about the House: This being observed by some Children at play, they carelessly put Fire to the scattered Powder, which communicated itself to that within the House, instantly blew it up, and buried about Thirty Persons in its Ruins. Thus did GOD in a Moment turn our Rejoicing into Mourn∣ing, and our Merriment into Lamentation and Sor∣row——When this Explosion first happened, every One expected that all Those within the House, at least, were gone to the Place of Silence; but GOD was bet∣ter

to us than our Fears; they were all taken out a∣lile, and save Six, who are since dead, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Viz. Doct.</HI> Nathaniel Ledyard, <HI>Mess'rs</HI> William Gar∣diner, Levi Jones, John Knowles, Richard Lord, Richard Burham.</NOTE> in a great Measure recovered. In the Midst of this sore Cala∣mity, the Goodness of God was very remarkably seen in sundry Instances—One of the Military Companies had but just left the House, before the Explosion hap∣pened; a considerable Number of Children were sent away, almost that very Instant, by some Gentlemen who had the Conduct of the Affair. As I am told, had this Explosion happened almost at any other Time of the Day, between Nine in the Morning, and Five in the Afternoon, much greater Numbers would have been exposed. Both the Ministers in the Town being by Sickness confined from public Service, the worthy Author, then on a Journey, was prevailed with to tarry over the Sabbath, to assist in our Distresses, and to supply the Pulpit. The following Discourse, then delivered, is now made public, at the Desire of the Hearers. And I take this Opportunity to return him my sincerest Thanks, for his great Humanity and Kind∣ness to this People in that Time of sore Visitation, when I was providentially hindred from being help∣ful to them myself: Also to express my most earnest Wishes, that his Labour of Love might be rewarded. And that the following Discourse may be sanctified, for the best Good of this People, for whose Benefit it was more immediately intended.</P>

<P>Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto Men that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the Wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT awful and alarming Provi∣vidence, which many of us beheld, that sudden Explosion, than which nothing but the Lightning seems more instantaneous, which buried many in the Ruins of that House, erected for the Instruction of Youth, and sent several of your Number away, to appear before the Bar of GOD▪ calls us to a mournful Meeting, invites our Minds to Improvement, our Hearts to sensible Sorrow for the Distresses of our Neighbours, and would render a Teacher inexcuseable, should he not endeavour to chuse suitable Words upon such an Occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010282_0004_0F7E711FA0828668"/>PROVIDENTIALLY with you, at a short Warn∣ing, in all the Confusion and Consternation of such a Disaster, I mean to ask your Candor for much Inchoherence; and intreat the Auditory to accept the sincere Desires of a Stranger, endea∣vouring to assist your Minds upon this sad Occasion.</P>
<P>LET me attempt a brief Explanation of the Words before us, to shorten the Work, and ren∣der the ensuing Discourse more easy to the Mind.</P>
<P>CUSTOM determined the eastern Nations to the Use of long Garments, very unhandy for Exer∣cise, and to the Use of the Girdle, wherewith they girded up their Garments enwrapped about their Loins, that they might not be entangled with them; but as much as possible, consistent with such Dress, be unincumbered, and ready for Ser∣vice.—Thus our SAVIOUR useth the Phrase more than once, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Luke 17, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Make ready, wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me.</HI>—<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John 21, 18.</NOTE> <HI>And another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not.</HI></P>
<P>'TWAS also a Custom among the Jews to cele∣brate their Nuptials by Night; and 'tis common for our SAVIOUR to represent Death, the final Pe∣riod of our probation State, by the coming of the Bridegroom. These Words are an Allusion to those eastern Customs, pregnant with Instruction to them that live in the Belief of a future State of Rewards and Punishments.</P>
<P>Here then I would,</P>
<P N="1">I. Endeavour to show what we may understand by this Command: <HI>Let your Loins be girded about.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="010282_0004_0F7E711FA0828668"/>II. Point out the Christian Duty, enjoined in these Words: <HI>And your Lights burning.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. That this, and this only, will prepare us for the immediate Summons of Death.</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT we are to understand by this Com∣mand: <HI>Let your Loins be girded about.</HI> As it was the Garment, something necessary for us in this fallen State; so,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is a plain Command, not indeed to throw off all Concerns and worldly Incumbrance; no, not even that which Custom and Ornament may dictate; but 'tis a Direction to put our near, out∣ward, worldly Concerns in such a Position, as shall least hinder and embarrass us in our LORD's Ser∣vice. We must have Food and Raiment, and consequently Care in providing, and some little Time, at least, in using them. What our LORD would, is, that we should not suffer these, which are designed for the Comfort of the outward Man, designed to help us forward in the Way; not suf∣fer them to perplex, confound, hinder, or embar∣rass us in our christian Warfare, our faithful Service —let them not hang upon us like dead Weights, nor drag after us, to hinder our Advance, or en∣tangle our Feet. Many the Snares, many the En∣tanglements, from outward Things, unless they are kept in proper Decorum, and wise Arrangement, by human Prudence, and Direction of the li∣ving, all-wise GOD. Whatever Service, whatever Employment, whatever Circumstances we are in, or may be called to in Life; 'tis the Christian's Duty, to make outward Things, Accidents and
<PB N="8" REF="010282_0005_0F7E71206976AB78"/>
Attendants (like the Garment girded about the Loins, for Use, Warmth and Comfort) subservi∣ent to his general Good and Welfare.—<HI>Let your Loins be girded about.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Besides all Embarrasment from outward Things, 'tis a Direction to us, to have and hold our Minds, free for Service, so unincumbred with the Cares of worldly Things, Plans, Pursuits, Engagements, or Enjoyments, that we can any Moment, calmly advert to Death, look forward to the Grave, and view the final Judgment, as al∣ready set, the Books opened, the Judge pre∣sent, and the Award just ready to be given, ac∣cording to the Deeds done in the Body.—<HI>Gird up the Loins of your Minds,</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 1, 13.</NOTE> &amp;c. The Mind, by Watchfulness, Prudence and Grace, may be raised to christian Fortitude, and such an elevated Holi∣ness, as to view all the Scenes of Eternity, with the utmost Calmness, tho' to be uncloathed even St. <HI>Paul</HI> could not desire. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.4.</NOTE> 'Tis unnatural, and hence never enjoined upon us, as a Duty, by the GOD of Nature.—'Tis possible to have our Trea∣sure in Heaven, and our Conversation savoring heavenly Things, not indeed thro' our own Pow∣er, and Strength, but thro' Help from GOD, which he affords them that humbly wait upon him, and make true Religion the leading Prin∣ciple. All the several Powers of the Mind may be exerted in Religion: Knowledge, Memory, Judgment, Perception, and Understanding. <HI>Grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Sa∣viour

Jesus Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 3.18.</NOTE> <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth, while the evil Days come not, nor the Years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no Pleasure in them.</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 1.2.1.</NOTE> <HI>For the Love of Christ constrain∣eth us, because we thus judge, that if One died for All, then were All dead.</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.14.</NOTE> And by careful Attenti∣on to Providences, one of the great Books of spiritual Knowledge;—by careful Attention to the Scriptures, GOD is pleased to open the <HI>Un∣derstanding, to perceive and understand, what is the Hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints.</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Eph. 1.18.19,</NOTE> <HI>And what is the exceeding Greatness of his Power to us ward who be∣lieve, according to the working of his mighty Power.</HI> The Mind may be girded up to Sobriety, Tem∣perance, Patience, Gentleness, Forgiveness, and Benevolence, which will be good Qualifications for Attendance on the Bridegroom, when ever he cometh. And the Minds enlarges and encreases in such Virtues, by Exercise and Improvement; very different is it, from these crazy frail Bodies, our earthly House of this Tabernacle, which con∣tinually wax old, and tend to Dissolution, by Labour and Exercise—<HI>exercise thyself rather un∣to Godliness. For bodily Exercise profiteth little; but Godliness is profitable unto all Things, having Promise of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 4.7.8</NOTE> Thus much, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more is comprised in this Command; <HI>Let your Loins be girded about.</HI> Come we now to the next—</P>
<P N="2">II. To point out the Christian Duty▪ enjoined
<PB N="10" REF="010282_0006_0F7E7121225AB168"/>
in these Words, <HI>and your Lights burning.</HI> Our Saviour himself has explained the Christians Light in a few Words; <HI>Let your Light so shine before Men, that they may see your goods Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Matt. 5.16.</NOTE> They are Works that may be seen, Works of holy Obedience to GOD's revealed Will. <HI>Now the End of the Commandment is Charity, out of a pure Heart, and of a good Con∣science, and of Faith unfeigned.</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.5.</NOTE> A Temper of uni∣versal Kindness and Benevolence, towards all our fellow Creatures, which leads us to wash the Saints Feet, and give Relief to them that are in real Distress; <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 5.10.</NOTE>—<HI>to visit the Fatherless in their Affliction</HI>; <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Jam. 1.27.</NOTE>—<HI>to bear one anothers Burdens</HI>; <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Gal. 6.2.</NOTE>— <HI>the Exercise of Charity, which shall cover a multitude of Sins</HI>;<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 4.8</NOTE>—<HI>to use Hospitality one to another, without grudging</HI>; <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 4, 9</NOTE> overlook the Failings, Frailties and real Transgressions of our fellow Mortals; yea, heartily forgive them all their Offences, as hearti∣ly as we desire GOD, thro' CHRIST, to forgive us our Offences.<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Mat. 6.14.15.</NOTE>—The Exercise of Patience under Trials, which in the Language of Scripture, is said to <HI>make us perfect &amp; entire, wanting nothing.</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ja. 1.4.</NOTE> A peacea∣ble, peace-making Temper of Mind, with Meekness &amp; Quietness, which is an Ornament of great Price in the Sight of GOD; <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 3.3</NOTE>—A Work of Self-Denial, and Mortification, of fleshly Lusts and Affections, which also may be perceived; wherein says St. Pe∣ter, <HI>They think it strange, that you run not with them to the same Excess of Riot, speaking Evil of you</HI>;<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">1 Pet 4.4.</NOTE>—

refraining from Malice, Envy, evil Speaking, evil Surmisings, Unthankfullness, Disobedience to Magistrates, Parents, Masters;—Disobedience to the Institutions of CHRIST, viz. Sabbath-Worship, and Ordinances, with a Spirit of Maliciousness against them, or with a Temper of careless Neg∣lect, and Contempt of them. These, with a Mul∣titude of others, plainly pointed out in the Gos∣pel, proceeding from Faith in our Lord JESUS CHRIST;—a firm, (and if I might coin a Word, I would say) a feeling Belief of the Truth of the Gospel, a firm Belief of the many, great and pre∣cious Promises therein given by CHRIST; <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 1, 4.</NOTE> an assured Expectation of Death, Judgment, and E∣ternity, just at Hand; with this feeling Belief, and Confidence, that such as are obedient to the heavenly Vision, the holy Commandment, shall as surely stand in the Judgment, with an ho∣ly Boldness, which Love, perfect Love which casteth out Fear, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">1 John 4.17, 18.</NOTE> will afford them that have been obedient, and lived not in Word and Tongue only, but in Deed and in Truth; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John 3.18.</NOTE> and I may add, an earnest Expectation, (which nothing can over∣come) of inheriting the Kingdom, prepared for the Saints, thro' the rich Mercy of GOD, and Blood of CHRIST; which alone is a sufficient Sacrifice to sanctify forever, all them that come unto GOD by Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Words direct us not only to have these several Graces in Habit, but also to have them in actual Exercise; and your Lights burning—not
<PB N="12" REF="010282_0007_0F7E7122D6E82E78"/>
sparkling, blazing, and flashing, but burning; which imports, a continual steady Motion, or Ex∣ertion of a most pure Element; burning so that it may be seen, and serve to keep the Heart warm, enlivened and fervent. <HI>Not slothful in Business, fervent in Spirit; serving the Lord.</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. 12.13.</NOTE> Those that had no Oyl in their Lamps, doubtless had some Kind of Light, which they mistook for a true burning Light, till the Bridegroom was near at Hand. The Oyl of Grace is necessary to keep the Light steadily burning. This steady Burning has these several Advantages.</P>
<P N="1">1. It prepares the Heart to meet the most dole∣ful Shocks, the material World can produce; prepares with Fortitude, and Composure of Mind, while we have (to express it with a bold Meta∣phor) one Foot in Heaven, and the other on Earth, with that Christian Confidence, that when∣ever our earthly House of this Tabernacle shall be dissolved, <HI>we have a Building with God, an House not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens</HI>; <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.1.</NOTE> <HI>where this Corruptible shall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal put on Immortality;—when Death shall be swallowed up in Victory.</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 15.54.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. It affords great Comfort, great Consolation to Christian Friends, who behold their Relations called away, with their Lights burning, hasting away into the World of Spirits, to shine with im∣mortal Lustre, in the Kingdom of our Father. It removes from surviving Relatives, that keep, heart-rending Concern, left they should be <HI>punished
<PB N="13" REF="010282_0007_0F7E7122D6E82E78"/>
with everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. 1.9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis a great Advantage to the Religion of our Lord, and serves to engage others to seek after, and pray for that glorious Light, and Christian Support, under the Encounter, of that last Enemy Death. It is a Means in the Hand of GOD, to lead others, to glorify the Name of our Heavenly Father, to adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour, who has brought Life and Im∣mortality to Light; which Hope beyond the Grave, is the only sovereign Antidote, against the deadly Fear of Death, and an Entrance in∣to that Land of Darkness. <HI>For as much then as the Children are Partakers of Flesh and Blood, he also him∣self likewise took Part of the same; that thro' Death he might destroy him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil; and deliver them who thro' Fear of Death were all their Lifetime subject to Bondage.</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.14.15.</NOTE> So that his Children may now say, with an humble Chearfulness, <HI>I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that Day.</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 1.12.</NOTE>—<HI>Yea, tho' I walk thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil: for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staff, they comfort me.</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Psa. 23.4.</NOTE>—We pass to say,</P>
<P N="3">III. That this, and this only, thro' Faith in the Redeemer, the ground Work of all holy Obedi∣ence, will prepare us for the immediate Summons of Death; or render us like unto Men who wait for their Lord. The Gospel-State is well com∣pared

to a Marriage-Supper, or a Wedding, in which the Bridegroom, is gone from his House, with his bodily Presence, to espouse the Bride, the Church, to himself, and return again, when the Marriage is completed. His knocking at the Door, doubtless points out to us, his coming by Death, to Summons our Spirits to Attendance upon that new Scence, a complete Espousal; or the final Period of our Stewardship, when we must resign up our Master's Goods, and be ac∣cepted or rejected, according to the Deeds done in the Body. This Light of Faith, and holy O∣bedience, is, what enables the Soul to arise up, open the Door, and heartily receive the Bride∣groom; these the Qualifications, that will entitle the Reward of Grace; from which awful Tribunal, the Award will nevertheless be given out, accord∣ing to the Deeds done in each one's own Body, whether they be good or bad. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.10.</NOTE> If we have not our Loins girded about, and our Lights burning, we are unprepared, and must be reckoned, among the foolish Virgins, who took no Oyl in their Lamps: While on the other Hand, such as have their Minds so exercised unto Godliness, are ready, always rea∣dy, while the Lights are burning. Their Stay in this dark World, is only a Waiting, <HI>for the glorious Appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Tit. 2.13.</NOTE> And in many there is a Desire, of the Appearing of the Bridegroom, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 4.8.</NOTE> that their Joy may be complete, and their Labour be re∣compensed, with the Reward of Grace.—The

earnest Expectation of the Creature, waiteth for the Manifestation of the Sons of God:—and not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first Fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves, groan within ourselves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Re∣demption of our Body. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.10.22.</NOTE>—GOD has never made known any other Way, in which to be ready, or like them that wait with Joy for the Coming of the Lord. This we find will prepare Men; we have illustrious Instances upon sacred Record, in the Apostles, and holy Men. <HI>For me to live is Christ, and to die is Gain.</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Phil. 1.21.</NOTE> Stephen the Martyr, we find, with his Lights burning: <HI>Being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into Heaven, and saw the Glory of God, and Jesus standing on the Right-Hand of God</HI>; with Calmness recommending his Spirit unto GOD, and his last Words fully expressive, of that christian Spirit, of Love, Good-Will, and hearty Forgiveness of his Persecutors. <HI>Lord, lay not this Sin to their Charge.</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Acts 7.55, &amp;c.</NOTE> And blessed be GOD, we have yet Reason to believe, there is, in one Place and another, a few holy Souls, that have not bowed the Knee to Baal, living Evidences of this Truth; that we may say in this Respect also, <HI>He has not left himself without Witness.</HI>—</P>
<P>Standing thus with the Loins girded about, and the Lights burning; prepares for the imme∣diate Summons of Death——they are ready, at whatever Hour the Bridegroom cometh, to open to him immediately—the Oyl is ready in the Lamp, the Light is burning. Is the Summons as in∣stantaneous

as the electric Flash of the forked Lightning, is it as sudden as the Explosion of Powder? they are ready. Shew us where the Per∣sons are to be found, that have invented, and com∣pleted any new Way, to be ready, calm and as∣suredly prepared for final Judgment, without this Gospel Preparation; and then we will honestly confess, that Infidelity, and not Faith, is their Victory, that overcometh the World.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The Subject before us presents to our View, this natural Improvement, viz. However great and numerous, worldly Enjoyments may be, whatever Incumbrances from outward Things, may surround us; the Command is plain, to dis∣pose them in the best Manner, that they may not be an Hindrance to us, in the Service of our LORD. Regulate worldly Cares, Enjoyments, and lawful Recreations so, that, these notwithstanding, we may be every Moment, in actual Readiness for the coming of our LORD: Which Duty is large∣ly, and forceably enjoined, by the Apostle, in these Words—<HI>But this I say, Brethren, the Time is short. It remaineth, that both they that have Wives, be as tho' they had none; and they that weep as tho' wept not; and they that rejoice as tho' they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as tho' they possessed not; and they that use this World as not abusing it; for the Fashion of this World passeth away.</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">1.

<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Let the Loins of our Minds be girded a∣bout; keep the Mind, at all Times, in all Pla∣ces, and under all Circumstances, improving, re∣flecting, and enlarging, and disposed, in such wise, as we should chuse to be found, under the same Circumstances, was our LORD to require our im∣mediate Appearance before his Tribunal. <HI>And blessed is that Servant, whom his Lord, when he com∣eth, shall find so doing.</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiv. 46.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Let us all seriously examine, whether we had, and now have, our Lights burning in such Manner and Measure, as we can now wish (con∣sidering our imperfect State) had it been our Lot to be numbered among them that fell, who were surprized in a Moment, in that House of In∣struction, where many were buried. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Brick School-House.</NOTE>—Do our Hearts condemn us, do our Consciences testify, that our Hearts are not, and were not right with GOD, nor <HI>sound in his Statutes</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 80.</NOTE>?—For our Soul's Sake, let us not defer a Moment!

However well dis∣posed we may hope, and charitably believe them to have been, who were called out of the world, would not they, would not their Friends, have given all in their Power to have redeemed them from that Explosion, this Dissolution of Na∣ture? <HI>But there is no Man that hath Power over the Spirits, to retain the Spirit; neither hath he Power in the Day of Death: And there is no Discharge in that War.</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Eccl. viii. 8.</NOTE>—None of them can, by any Means, <HI>redeem his Brother, nor give to God a Ransom for him: that he should still live forever, and not see Corruption.</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Psalm xlix. 7.9.</NOTE>—If their Lights were burn∣ing, happy they, who have in a short Time, finish∣ed their Combat, and entered in with the Bride∣groom.

How is our Rejoicing turned into Mourning, and what was judged an innocent Recreation, into Heaviness! Learn, O Inhabitants of this Place, O young Men and Maidens, Children and Ser∣vants, learn to rejoice with trembling. Remem∣ber that Death many Times lies intrenched, as fatally in the highest Mirth and Rejoicing, as by the Sides of them, who never eat with Pleasure. <HI>They shall lie down alike in the Dust, and the Worms shall cover them.</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Eccl. ix. 12.</NOTE><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Job xxi. 25, 26.</NOTE></P>

Patience that you may possess your Souls in this Tryal, and hold out unto the End. And may GOD so direct, and teach, and you so improve and learn, that in the End you may say, <HI>'tis good for us that we have been afflicted.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. To the young Men and Children of this Congregation.</P>
<P>Were your departed Friends, Acquaintance, and Companions, to address you from the World of Spirits, could it be more nervous, and perti∣nent, than what naturally arises, from this sad Providence, and these Words of our Text? Be∣hold, you that are spared, behold the Ruins of that House, where we have associated, where we have had Mirth and Gladness, as well as Instruc∣tion, blasted in a Moment; made a Kind of a Grave to us in an Instant, before we had Time for Reflection; ask them who survive, whether they had known the Cause of Death, had they been cut off with that Blast. <HI>Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lights burning, and ye your∣selves like unto Men that wait for the Lord.</HI> Was it a Day appointed for Rejoicing, and who tho't what a Day, what a Moment would bring forth. Boast not in your Mirth, boast not of To-mor∣row, boast not of a Moment. Young Men, we exhort you to be sober-minded; let your Mode∣ration be known to all Men: The LORD is at Hand. Improve your Time, in trimming your Lamps, that your Lights may burn. See how instantly, how immediately the Bridegroom came to us, and left us little if any Time to gird our
<PB N="23" REF="010282_0012_0F7E71265C5455A8"/>
Loins, procure Oyl, or even trim the Lamps, if Oyl were already in them.—Is this the Effect of Rejoicing! We then exhort you to rejoice, not in Vapour and Chimeras; <HI>Rejoice rather in God your Saviour,</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 47.</NOTE> <HI>rejoice in the Hope of the Glory of God</HI>▪ <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 2.</NOTE> To you, young Friends, the Voice of Providence is loud, <HI>be ye also ready.</HI> Let not this Visitation pass over, without engaging a few at least, to put on the Wedding Garment, if this Providence will not arouse your Minds, if this Opportunity be neglected by you, when the Eye affects the Heart, when Death is all around you, when dying Groans are in many Houses, what do you expect, in Nature or Providence, will ever awaken you! Cry then to GOD, cry mightily to him, to assist in lighting up your Lamps, to draw you with his loving Kindness, instruct you with his Word, Spirit, and Providence, that Iniquity may not prove your Ruin. And may GOD grant in Mercy, that this Dispensation, which proves natural Death to some, may be a Means of spiri∣tual Life to others, yea, as Life from the Dead to your Souls.</P>
<P>Finally, To the Auditory in general.</P>
<P>Let us account it Mercy and Long-suffering, that we were not smitten down with our Fellows. How many among us, know not of Danger there more than at any other given Place.—<HI>O Lord, I know that the Way of Man is not in himself: It is not in Man that walketh to direct his Steps!</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Jerem. x. 23.</NOTE> What but a kind Providence directed many of us, at
<PB N="24" REF="010282_0013_0F7E712A34F25240"/>
that Instant, out of Harm's Way! How many but a little before, were within the Reach of that sad Catastrophe! May the Goodness of GOD to us ward, lead us to Repentance: We have our Space lengthened out, and if we do not improve it, to gird up our Loins, seek Light, and endea∣vour to keep it burning: we may well fear, that GOD will quickly say of us, <HI>Cut them down, why cumber they the Ground.</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 7.</NOTE>—Let this Providence en∣gage us also, to stand ready in all Acts of holy Obedience to GOD, Love, Kindness, Gentleness, Patience and Forgiveness towards our fellow Men, growing in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. Let us pass the Time of our sojourning here in Fear, giving all Diligence to make our Calling and Election sure: May we live the Life of the Righteous, may our latter End be peace, and our Rest Glo∣rious, by the Grace of GOD, through the endless Ages of Eternity. AMEN.</P>
