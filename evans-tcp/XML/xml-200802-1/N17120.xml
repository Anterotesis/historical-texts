<P>THE following POEM is selected from a variety of scraps, which were composed in the fervour of imagination, as the different subjects presented them∣selves to the Author. He has endeavoured, as much as possible, to arrange them in some dependence on each other; but a Work of this nature will necessarily be imperfect and irregular. The Author has not the pre∣sumption to suppose, that an insignificant Poem, so en∣tirely destitute of incident, can ever be an object of ge∣neral regard: To the few, however, who are finely sensible of the beauties of nature, who are pleased with something more than the music of poetry, he dedicates his performance; and to those only he would recom∣mend the perusal of it.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>SUBJECTS.—A morning's walk—Imperfect description of the country on the coast of New-Jersey—Address to nature—Shooting censured—Change of scene, with a de∣scription of a storm in autumn—Succeeding serenity of weather—Apostrophe to the sun.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>UPON the dewy landscape op'ning wide,</L>
<L>The joyous morn now issues; and I rise</L>
<L>Refreshen'd from repose, as the bright sun,</L>
<L>Ascending in his azure course, uplifts</L>
<L>My meditation to the farthest heav'n.</L>
<L>The glist'ning meadows seem to breathe a-new</L>
<L>In fragrant exhalations; while the fogs,</L>
<L>In their retreat collected, gather round</L>
<L>The distant hills, whose summits unobscur'd</L>
<L>In variegated foliage clad</L>
<L>Rise 'mid the lustre of th' autumnal sky.</L>
<L>—And now the whole perspective bright'ning</L>
<L>Through its extent, discovers a serene</L>
<L>And boundless day. Through ev'ry sense inspir'd</L>
<L>With animation, in the pathless field</L>
<L>I stroll delighted; or, above the vale,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="022100_0004_0FB6E586E24B4818"/>
Pause on the rising hill to dwell at ease</L>
<L>On the rich profusion of its increase,</L>
<L>Where, in extended rows and ripening</L>
<L>To the beams of autumn, the tufted corn</L>
<L>Wave their dejected crests, and the orchard</L>
<L>Intermingled, eminent in its growth,</L>
<L>Bends beneath the golden fruit:—And here too</L>
<L>Encircling woods, that with uneven bounds</L>
<L>Design the neighb'ring farms and circumscribe</L>
<L>The toils of husbandry, afford a range</L>
<L>For contemplation, where unmolested</L>
<L>By the gaze of rustic curiosity,</L>
<L>And in the windings of the leafy glade</L>
<L>I vent unheard th' emotions of my breast.</L>
<L>—In these blest hours, when nature's placid charms</L>
<L>Reflect serene complacence o'er my soul,</L>
<L>Wisdom step forth, and with an energy</L>
<L>Impress thy strongest lessons on my heart—</L>
<L>Truths, which through all the turbulence of life,</L>
<L>The impulse of blind passions, and the wiles</L>
<L>Of vice alluring, or unmanly sloth,</L>
<L>May hold a firm unalterable sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Around me, with impervious intercourse</L>
<L>Of wood, the forest terminates in shade,</L>
<L>Or in a series of decreasing trunks</L>
<L>Above invested with promiscuous garbs;</L>
<L>Save where, apart, and in stately silence,</L>
<L>The sapless oak with majesty exalts</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="022100_0005_0FB6E58E2CA9EA08"/>
Its venerable limbs, leafless with years</L>
<L>And with'ring in the last decay—or save</L>
<L>Where, in unfrequent interstice, amid</L>
<L>The broken foliage delicately ting'd</L>
<L>With autumns mellow saffron, intervenes</L>
<L>A prospect of ethereal azure.</L>
<L>How oft delighted with the wild attire</L>
<L>Of nature in her recesses, thro' scenes</L>
<L>Like these, in roving childhood have I strav'd,</L>
<L>Aw'd with the gloom and desart solitude</L>
<L>That environ'd me! or, musing on some tale</L>
<L>Of magic wonders, in the sunny heights</L>
<L>And sylvan hills have pictur'd to myself</L>
<L>The mansions of fantastic Genii.</L>
<L>What tho' I trace not in these happy climes</L>
<L>The fam'd luxuriance of Arcadian vales,</L>
<L>Spontaneous gardens or parterre's enrich'd</L>
<L>With lavish culture and the pride of taste;</L>
<L>There is a rude disorder in these wilds,</L>
<L>A native grandeur, that unaffected</L>
<L>By the touch of art, transcends its graces</L>
<L>And strikes some finer sense within the soul.</L>
<L>Nature—sweet parent of unenvied bliss,</L>
<L>Constant, lib'ral benefactress, whose charms</L>
<L>For chaste and loveliest simplicity</L>
<L>Fill thy admirers with renew'd delights</L>
<L>That never pall the taste. We need not boast</L>
<L>The smiles of partial fortune, or the rights</L>
<L>Of affluence to enjoy thy bounties—</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="022100_0006_0FB6E59020DC27B8"/>
They're the common heritage of us all,</L>
<L>In thee the outcast of society</L>
<L>Will find a refuge from his miseries,</L>
<L>A soothing and unalter'd friend; and th' hand</L>
<L>That on the bosom of th' adjacent hills</L>
<L>Guides his lone plough, eyeing as he proceeds,</L>
<L>With a glance of heart-felt satisfaction,</L>
<L>The cerulean bay that gently fluctuates</L>
<L>Mid the surrounding auburn woods, in thee</L>
<L>Unconscious feels a sweet'ner of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> toil.</L>
<L>—And is it not enough that bounteous heav'n</L>
<L>Has strung our feeling to a harmony</L>
<L>So exquisite with nature, that we seek,</L>
<L>In merciless invasion on the lives</L>
<L>Of helpless brutes, a transport from their pangs.</L>
<L>How ardent! with what earnestness of hope</L>
<L>Yon sportsman takes the field! on ev'ry side</L>
<L>In studious survey, upon the haunts</L>
<L>Where crouch the timid quail intent, he starts</L>
<L>With eager trepidation at the flight,</L>
<L>Sudden and son'rous as the bevy springs—</L>
<L>Then aims the fatal instrument; and flies</L>
<L>In fiercest exultation to secure</L>
<L>The fallen victim, flutt'ring in the wound</L>
<L>And struggling with the agonies of death.</L>
<L>O sensibility! to whom the plaint</L>
<L>Of suff'ring innocence ne'er sigh'd in vain,</L>
<L>Rise, with conviction, rise in its defence</L>
<L>And pluck this savage instinct from our breasts.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="022100_0007_0FB6E5914CB98D98"/>
But, from such wanton cruelties averse,</L>
<L>Still let me linger on the happy smiles</L>
<L>Of autumn all benign, when tranquil most</L>
<L>With ceaseless pleasure then most inviting.</L>
<L>Here scent the morning fragrance of her gales,</L>
<L>The noon enjoy, and watch her parting beams,</L>
<L>That spread a mild effulgence in the west,</L>
<L>From the faint yellow blushing into red.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soon the transitory scene is rob'd</L>
<L>Of all its beauties and enliv'ning charms,</L>
<L>As from the east in threat'ning gloom involv'd</L>
<L>Ascends the gather'd tempest—the drear clouds</L>
<L>Lowering move onward, while beneath them</L>
<L>Flies a light mist precipitate and wild.</L>
<L>From th' interrupted labours of the day</L>
<L>The swain retires; in sad society</L>
<L>The domestic broods assemble pensive;</L>
<L>And thro' the lonely fields no creature stirs,</L>
<L>Where in deep silence ev'ry voice is hush'd,</L>
<L>Save the shrill gulls, that wasted from the coast</L>
<L>Soar in promiscuous circles o'er the land</L>
<L>And meet the terrors of th' impending storm.</L>
<L>At first the wand'ring clouds emit a rare</L>
<L>Uncertain show'r, or on the mountains side</L>
<L>Pour down in streams collected and oblique—</L>
<L>Wide and more wide the thick'ning deluge spreads,</L>
<L>Till the whole earth's o'erwhelm'd and floats immense.</L>
<L>How chang'd the prospect, where I lately dwelt</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="022100_0008_0FB6E598AF00BAE8"/>
With glowing admiration, seen dimly</L>
<L>Thro' the fleeting rain! the valleys hidden,</L>
<L>And the tall hills grown desolate and dun,</L>
<L>Seem mingled with the clouds in sullen forms,</L>
<L>A brooding vapour hangs before the sight,</L>
<L>And spreads its gloomy shadow on the mind.</L>
<L>—Methinks within the center of yon wood,</L>
<L>Fearful and dark, while thrilling midnight reigns,</L>
<L>Some way-worn, solitary traveller</L>
<L>Wanders bewildered: around him beats</L>
<L>The drifting rain; the cheerless hollow blast</L>
<L>Moans among the trees; and the upland rocks,</L>
<L>That vent a hoarsely-sounding cataract,</L>
<L>Deepen the sadness of a double night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But towards the morn, rising from a gale,</L>
<L>Comes on the fierce north-west—it intermits,</L>
<L>As to collect new force; and then breaks forth</L>
<L>With more unbridled vengeance, its madness</L>
<L>Venting on the world. Shaken to its base</L>
<L>The firm mansion totters; the stately woods</L>
<L>Succumbing roar; and the wide ocean</L>
<L>Convulsed unto its profoundest caverns</L>
<L>Swells to tremendous heights, that hurried on</L>
<L>In dread contortion foam before the wind,</L>
<L>And burst with thundering torrents on the shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now let me climb some mountains stormy cliffs</L>

Of heav'n, envelop'd in an eddying cloud</L>
<L>Of foliage, torn by distracting whirlwinds</L>
<L>From the forest: and, while all nature round</L>
<L>Is agitated in tempestuous din,</L>
<L>Calm and undismay'd let me give a loose</L>
<L>To fancy; eye the wild struggling prospect,</L>
<L>And listen to the uproar of the wind.</L>
<L>But soon o'er half the horizon looks forth</L>
<L>A lively day. The remnants of the storm,</L>
<L>Condens'd into innumerable clouds,</L>
<L>Recede with swiftness from th' aerial force</L>

<L>A lingering, melancholy echo.</L>
<L>Then welcome darkness, gloomy nourisher</L>
<L>Of despondence, whose kind dominion checks</L>
