<P>THE Methods now pursued in teaching the <HI>English Tongue,</HI> are such as give all the Ad∣vantages, that formerly could only be acquired by an Acquaintance with the dead Languages; This has raised its Value, and brought into Es∣teem many of the Productions, and elegant Com∣positions, that have appeared in the <HI>English</HI> Language, whose Beauties and Value were hi∣therto, only perceptible to those who had labour∣ed in the learned Languages, or had walked in the Fields of Science.</P>
<P>The present Method of teaching the <HI>English Language,</HI> adopted in our first Schools, where Gentlemen of the most classical as well as liberal Education preside, not only leads the Scholar into a proper Knowledge of <HI>Grammar,</HI> but in∣troduces him to the more polite Parts of Lite∣rature, whereby he is instructed in <HI>Syntax, Pro∣sody,</HI> and all the Beauties of <HI>Trope</HI> and <HI>Figure,</HI> &amp;c. These, while they refine the Taste, en∣large the Conception, and so improve the Mind, as to fit it for the most rational of all Amuse∣ments, that of studying a good Author, entering thoroughly into his Meaning, and as it were im∣bibing his Spirit. In these Pursuits some of the
<PB REF="021495_0003_0FB404229094CBF8"/>
most admired of the English Writers, both in Prose and Verse, have been introduced into our Schools; whose Beauties and Excellencies being first laid before the Pupil by his Tutor, he in a little Time becomes capable of himself to point them out. And as that Part of THOMSON'S WORKS, which include the SEASONS, is parti∣cularly adapted to the Purpose, a very correct Edition is here offered, Printed from his last Cor∣rections; to which is added his Poem, entitled, BRITANNIA, which breathing the Spirit of true <HI>Patriotism, Liberty,</HI> and <HI>Love of Mankind,</HI> is pe∣culiarly well calculated for Youth and tender minds; and, as our Author himself expresses it,
<Q><L>—"to rear the tender Thought,</L>
<L>To teach the young Idea how to shoot,</L>
<L>To pour the fresh Instruction o'er the Mind,</L>
<L>To breathe th' enlivening Spirit, and to fix</L>
<L>The generous Purpose in the glowing Breast."</L>
<BIBL>SPRING, 1148.</BIBL></Q>
But that this Piece may be still more useful, and more fully to answer the Design, and lead the Youth into a Variety of the pleasing Paths of Poetry, a Collection of other Pieces are here in∣serted, to instruct him in the Beauties of an <HI>Ode,</HI> an <HI>Elegy,</HI> &amp;c. without raising the Purchase above the Rate of common School Books.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE AND LITERARY CHARACTER OF JAMES THOMSON; Pointing out some particular Beauties of the Au∣thor for the Use of young Minds.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES THOMSON, an eminent British poet, was the son of a Divine in Scotland, and born at Ednam, in the shire of Roxburgh, the eleventh of Sep∣tember, 1700. He gave early marks of genius, which was discoverable through the rudeness of his puerile essays; and, after the usual course of school educa∣tion at J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dburgh, was sent to the university of Edin∣burgh. In the second year of his admission, his stu∣dies were for some time interrupted by the death of his father; but his mother soon after repaired with her family, which was very numerous, to Edinburgh, where sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lived in a decent frugal manner, till her favourite son had not only finished his academical
<PB N="ii" REF="021495_0005_0FB40425910CDA58"/>
course, but was even d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stinguished and patronized as a genius. About this time the study of poetry be∣came pretty general in Scotland, the best English au∣thors being universally read, and imitations of them attempted; but taste as yet had made but little pro∣gress, cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ticism being there limited to rules and forms, which served only to discover the inaccuracies of a poet, while his fire and fancy escaped their notice. Thomson, who believed he was entitled to judges of a more exalted genius, began to turn his views to∣wards London which an accident soon after intirely determined him in.</P>
<P>The divinity chair at Edinburgh was then filled by Mr Hamilton, whose lectures our author attended ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut a year, when in an exercise in the psalm, in which the power and majesty of God were celebrat∣ed, he gave so highly poetical and sublime a para∣phrase and illustration, that it surprized the whole audience. Mr. Hamilton complimented him on this performance in a particular manner; but at the same time told him, in his smiles of approbation, that if he expected to be useful in the ministry, he must keep a stricter rein upon his imagination, and express him∣self in language more suitable to an audience, where the learned and unlearned are equally respectable. Thomson concluded from this, that his expectations from the study of theology might be precarious, even though the church had been his choice; so that, hav∣ing some encouragement from a lady of quality, a friend of his mother, then in London, he quickly pre∣pared for his journey, which ended in no more than giving him an opportunity of entering on the stage of the unknown world, without a patron, and but sparingly provided with cash.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="021495_0006_0FB4042710501238"/>However, his merit did not lie long concealed. Mr. Forbes, af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds lord presi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of the session, received him very kindly, and introduced him to some of his friends, part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cularly to Mr. Aickman, whose premature death he has with great affection comme∣morated, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a copy of verses written on that occasion. The favourable manner in which he was every where received, emboldened him to risk the publicat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of his <HI>Winter,</HI> in March <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>726, which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no sooner read than univ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsally admired; and from that time his ac∣quaintance was courted by all men of taste Dr. Rundle, afterwards bishop of Lerry, received him into his intimate confidence and friendship; promoted his character every where: introduced him to his great friend the lord chancellor Talbot; and some years after, when the eldest son of that nobleman was to make his tour, recommended Mr Thomson as a proper companion for him. His affection and gra∣titude to Dr. Rundle are finely expressed, in his poem to the memory of lord Talbot. Our author held the estimation of the public so highly, that he fi∣nished the plan which their wishes laid out for him; and the expectations which his <HI>Winter</HI> had raised, were fully answered in the successive publication of the other seasons; <HI>Summer,</HI> in the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>727; <HI>Spring,</HI> in the beginn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of 1728; and <HI>Autumn,</HI> in a quarto edition of his works, in 1730.</P>
<P>Besides these, and his tragedy of Sophonisb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which was well received in the year 1729, Mr. Thomson had, in 1727, published his poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n lately deceased. The same year, the resentment of our merchants, for the interruption of their trade by the Spaniards in America▪ running very high, Mr Thomson zea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ously took part in it, and wrote his poem Britannia,
<PB N="iv" REF="021495_0007_0FB4042890346C18"/>
to rouse the nation to revenge. His poetical pursuits were now interrupted by his attendance on the ho∣nourable Mr. Charles Talbot in his travels, with whom he visited most of the courts and capital cities of Europe. How particular and judicious his obser∣vations were, appears from his poem on Liberty, in five parts, thus in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itled. Ancient and Modern Italy compared; Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce; Rome; Britain; the Prospect. While he was writing the first part of Liberty, he received a severe shock, by the death of his noble friend and fellow-traveller, and this was soon fol∣lowed by another still more so, and of more general concern, the death of lord Talbot himself; which Mr. Thomson so pathetically laments, in the poem dedicated to his memory. At the same time he found himself from an easy competency, reduced to a state of precarious dependence, in which he passed the remainder of his life, excepting only the two last years of it, during which he enjoyed the place of surveyor general of the Leeward islands, procured for him by the generous friendship of lord Lyttleton.</P>
<P>Immediately upon his return to England with Mr. Talbot, the chancellor had made him his secretary of briefs, a place of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle attendance, suiting his re∣tired indolent way of life, and equal to all his wants. This place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell with his patron; yet his genius could not be depressed, or his temper hurt, by this reverse of fortune. He resumed, in time, his usual chear∣fulness, and never abated one article in his way of living; which, though simple, was elegant, and with a peculiar neatness. The profits arising from his works w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re not inconsiderable; his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy of Agamemnon, acted in 1738, gave many nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to the author.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="021495_0008_0FB4042A0F412AA8"/>But his chief dependence, during this long inter∣val, was on the protection and bounty of his royal highness Frederick Prince of Wales, who, upon the recommendation of lord Lyttleton, then his chief fa∣vourite, settled on him an handsome allowance, and always received him very graciously. It hap∣pened, however, that the favour of his royal high∣ness was, in one instance, of some prejudice to Mr. Thomson, in the refusal of a licence for his tragedy of Edward and Eleanora, which he had prepared for the stage in the year 1739. This proceeded from the misunderstand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng which then subsisted between the court of the prince of Wales, and that of the king his father. His next dramatic performance was the masque of Alfred, written jointly with Mr. Mallet, who was his good friend on many occasions, and by command of the prince of Wales, for the entertainment of his royal highness's court at his Summer residence▪ In the year 1745, his Tancred and Sigismunda, taken from the novel in Gil Blas, was well received. He in the mean time, was fi∣nishing his Castle of Indolence, an allegorical poem, in two canto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The stanza in which he wrote this piece is that of Spencer, borrowed from the Italian poets. This was the last piece published by Mr. Thomson, his tragedy of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lanus being only. prepared for the theatre, when a fever seized him, and deprived the world of a very good man, as well as a very great poet. His death happened on the 27th of August, 1748. His executors were the lord Lyt∣tleton and Mr. Mitchel; and, by their interest, the orphan play of Coriolanus was brought on the stage to the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st advantage: from the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fits of which, and from the sale of his manuscripts and other effects, all demands were duly satisfied, and a handsome sum
<PB N="vi" REF="021495_0009_0FB4042C3B824890"/>
remitted to his sisters. His remains were deposited in the church of Richmond, under a plain stone, without any inscription.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomson himself hints, somewhere in his works, that his figure was not the most promising, his make being rather robust than graceful; and his worst appearance was, when he was seen walking alone, in a thoughtful mood: but when saluted by a friend▪ and they entered into conversation he would instantly brighten into a most amiable aspect, his features no longer the same, and his eyes darting a peculiar and animated fire. He had im∣proved his taste by the best originals, both ancient and modern, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t could not bear to write what was not strictly hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own. What he borrowed from the ancients, he gives us in an avowed faithful paraphrase, or translation, as we see in a few passages taken from Virgil, and in that beautiful picture from the elder Pliny, where the course and gradual increase of the Nile are figured by the stages of man's life The Autumn was his favourite season for poetical compo∣sition, and the deep silence of the night the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me he commonly chose for such studies: so that he would often be heard walking in his study till near morning, humming over, in his way, what he was to correct and write out the next day. The amusements of his leisure hours were civil and natural history, voyages, and the best relations of travellers; and, had his si∣tuation favoured it, he would certainly have excelled in gardening, agriculture, and every rural improve∣ment and exercise. Although he performed on no instrument, he was passionately fond of music, and would sometimes listen a full hour at his window to the nightingales in Richmond-gardens. Nor was
<PB N="vii" REF="021495_0010_0FB4042D1008ACE0"/>
his taste less exquisite in the arts of painting, sculp∣ture, and architecture. In his travels, he had seen all the most celebrated monuments of antiquity, and the best productions of modern art, and had studied them so minutely, and with such true judgment, that, in some of his descriptions of his poem on Liberty, we have them so delineated as to place them in a stronger light, perhaps, than if we saw them with our eyes. As for the more distinguishing qualities of his mind and heart, they are best discoverable in his writings, than they can be presented by the pen of any biographer. There his love of mankind, of his country and friends; his devotion to his God, founded on the most elevated and just conception of his operative power and providence, shines in every page. So unbounded was his tenderness of heart, that it took in even the brute creation: he was ex∣tremely tender towards his own species. He is not indeed known, through his whole life, to have given any person one moment's pain by his writings, or otherwise. He took no part in the poetical squabbles of his time, and so was respected and left undisturb∣ed by both parties. These amiable virtues, this di∣vine temper of mind, did not fail of their due re∣ward: the best and greatest men of his time honour∣ed him with their friendship and protection: the ap∣plause of the public attended all his productions; his friends loved him with an enthusiastic ardour, and sincerely lamented his untimely death.</P>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The subject proposed. Addressed to Mr <HI>ONSLOW.</HI> A prospect of the fields ready for harvest. Reflections in praise of industry rais'd by that view. Reaping. A tale relative to it. A harvest-storm. Shooting and hunting, their barbarity. A ludicrous account of fox-hunting. A view of an orchard. Wall-fruit. A vineyard. A description of fogs, frequent in the latter part of <HI>Autumn:</HI> whence a digression, enquiring into the rise of fountains and rivers. Birds of season con∣sidered, that now shift their habitation. The prodigi∣ous number of them that cover the northern and western isles of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> Hence a view of the country. A prospect of the discoloured, fading woods. After a gen∣tle dusky day, moon-light. Autumnal meteors. Morn∣ing: to which succeeds a calm, pure, sun-shiny day, such as usually shuts up the season. The harvest being gathered in, the country dissolved in joy. The whole concludes with a panegyric on a philosophical country life.</P>

AUTUMN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>CROWN'D with the sickle and the wheaten sheaf,</L>
<L>While AUTUMN, nodding o'er the yellow plain,</L>
<L>Comes jovial on; the <HI>Doric</HI> reed once more,</L>
<L>Well pleas'd, I tune. Whate'er the Wint'ry frost</L>
<L>Nitrous prepar'd; the various-blossom'd Spring <MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>Put in white promise forth; and Summer-suns</L>
<L>Concocted strong, rush boundless now to view,</L>
<L>Full, perfect all, and swell my glorious theme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ONSLOW! the Muse, ambitious of thy name,</L>
<L>To grace, inspire, and dignify her song,<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>Would from the <HI>Public Voice</HI> thy gentle ear</L>
<L>A-while engage. Thy noble cares she knows,</L>
<L>The patriot virtues that distend thy thought,</L>
<L>Spread on thy front, and in thy bosom glow;</L>
<L>While listening senates hang upon thy tongue,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Devolving thro' the maze of eloquence</L>
<L>A roll of periods, sweeter than her song.</L>
<L>But she too pants for public virtue; she,</L>
<L>Tho' weak <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> of power, yet strong in ardent will,</L>
<L>Whene'er her country rushes on her heart,<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Assumes a bolder note, and fondly tries</L>
<L>To mix the patriot's with the poet's flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN the bright <HI>Virgin</HI> gives the beauteous days,</L>
<L>And <HI>Libra</HI> weighs in equal scales the year;</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="021495_0117_0FB404D1504DB4C0"/>From heaven's high cope the fierce effulgence shook <MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Of parting summer, a serener blue,</L>
<L>With golden light enliven'd, wide invests</L>
<L>The happy world. Attemper'd suns arise,</L>
<L>Sweet-beam'd, and shedding oft thro' lucid clouds</L>
<L>A pleasing calm; while broad, and brown, below,<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Extensive harvests hang the heavy head.</L>
<L>Rich, silent, deep, they stand; for not a gale</L>
<L>Rolls its light billows o'er the bending plain;</L>
<L>A calm of plenty! till the ruffled air</L>
<L>Falls from its poise, and gives the breeze to blow.<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>Rent is the fleecy mantle of the sky;</L>
<L>The clouds fly different; and the sudden sun</L>
<L>By fits effulgent gilds th' illumin'd field,</L>
<L>And black by fits the shadows sweep along▪</L>
<L>A gayly-checker'd heart-expanding view,<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Far as the circling eye can shoot around,</L>
<L>Unbounded tossing in a flood of corn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE are thy blessings, INDUSTRY! rough power!</L>
<L>Whom labour still attends, and sweat, and pain;</L>
<L>Yet the kind source of every gentle art,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>And all the soft civility of life;</L>
<L>Raiser of human kind! by Nature cast,</L>
<L>Naked, and helpless, out amid the woods,</L>
<L>And wilds, to rude inclement elements;</L>
<L>With various seeds of art deep in the mind <MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>Implanted, and profusely pour'd around</L>
<L>Materials infinite; but idle all.</L>
<L>Still unexerted, in th' unconscious breast,</L>
<L>Slept the lethargic powers; corruption still,</L>
<L>Voracious, swallow'd what the liberal hand <MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>Of bounty scatter'd o'er the savage year:</L>
<L>And still the sad barbarian, roving, mix'd</L>
<L><PB N="105" REF="021495_0118_0FB404D2D8B14A00"/>With beasts of prey; or for his acorn-meal</L>
<L>Fought the fierce tusky boar; a shivering wretch!</L>
<L>Aghast, and comfortless, when the bleak north,<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>With Winter charg'd, let the mix'd tempest fly,</L>
<L>Hail, rain, and snow, and bitter-breathing frost:</L>
<L>Then to the shelter of the hut he fled:</L>
<L>And the wild season, sordid, pin'd away.</L>
<L>For home he had not; home is the resort <MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where,</L>
<L>Supporting and supported, polish'd friends,</L>
<L>And dear relations mingle into bliss.</L>
<L>But this the rugged savage never felt,</L>
<L>Even desolate in crowds; and thus his days,<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>Roll'd heavy, dark, and unenjoy'd along;</L>
<L>A waste of time! till INDUSTRY approach'd,</L>
<L>And rous'd him from his miserable sloth:</L>
<L>His faculties unfolded; pointed out,</L>
<L>Where lavish Nature the directing hand <MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>Of art demanded; shew'd him how to raise</L>
<L>His feeble force by the mechanic powers,</L>
<L>To dig the mineral from the vaulted earth,</L>
<L>On what to turn the piercing rage of fire,</L>
<L>On what the torrent, and the gather'd blast; <MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>Gave the tall antient forest to his axe;</L>
<L>Taught him to chip the wood, and hew the stone,</L>
<L>Till by degrees the finish'd fabric rose;</L>
<L>Tore from his limbs the blood-polluted furr,</L>
<L>And wrapt them in the woolly vestment warm,<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>Or bright in glossy silk, and flowing lawn;</L>
<L>With wholesome viands fill'd his table, pour'd</L>
<L>The generous glass around, inspir'd to wake</L>
<L>The life-refining soul of decent wit:</L>
<L>Nor stoop'd at barren bare necessity,<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>But still advancing bolder, led him on,</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="021495_0119_0FB404D512E21758"/>To pomp, to pleasure, elegance, and grace;</L>
<L>And, breathing high ambition thro' his soul,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN gathering men their natural powers combin'd</L>
<L>And form'd a <HI>Public</HI>; to the general good</L>

<L>For this the <HI>Patriot-Council</HI> met, the full,</L>

<L>For this they plann'd the holy guardian laws,</L>

<L><HI>Imperial Justice</HI> at the helm; yet still</L>
<L>To them accountable: nor slavish dream'd <MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>That toiling millions must resign their weal,</L>
<L>And all the honey of their search, to such</L>
<L>As for themselves alone themselves have rais'd.</L>

<L>In order set, protected, and inspir'd,<MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>Into perfection wrought. Uniting all,</L>

<L>And happy. Nurse of art! the city rear'd</L>
<L>In beauteous pride her tower-encircled head;</L>
<L>And, stretching street on street, by thousands drew,<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>From twining woody haunts, or the tough yew</L>
<L>To bows strong-straining, her aspiring sons.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN COMMERCE brought into the public walk</L>
<L>The busy merchant; the big ware-house built;</L>
<L>Rais'd the strong crane; choak'd up the loaded Street</L>
<L>With foreign plenty; and thy stream, O THAMES, 121</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN, too, the pillar'd dome, magnific, heav'd <MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>Its ample roof; and luxury within</L>
<L>Pour'd out her glittering stores: the canvas smooth,</L>

<L>ALL is the gift of INDUSTRY; whate'er</L>

<L>THE lovely young LAVINIA once had friends;</L>
<L>And Fortune smil'd, deceitful, on her birth.</L>
<L>For, in her helpless years depriv'd of all,<MILESTONE N="180"/></L>
<L>Of every stay, save Innocence and HEAVEN,</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="021495_0122_0FB404D990F199C8"/>She with her widow'd mother, feeble, old,</L>
<L>And poor, liv'd in a cottage, far retir'd</L>
<L>Among the windings of a woody vale;</L>
<L>By solitude and deep surrounding shades,<MILESTONE N="185"/></L>
<L>But more by bashful modesty, conceal'd.</L>
<L>Together thus they shunn'd the cruel scorn</L>
<L>Which virtue, sunk to poverty, would meet</L>
<L>From giddy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">passion</NOTE> fashion and low-minded pride:</L>
<L>Almost on Nature's common bounty fed,<MILESTONE N="190"/></L>
<L>Like the gay birds that sung them to repose,</L>
<L>Content, and careless of to-morrow's fare.</L>
<L>Her form was fresher than the morning rose,</L>

<L>As is the lily, or the mountain snow,<MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L>The modest virtues mingled in her eyes,</L>

<L>Their humid beams into the blooming flowers:</L>
<L>Or when the mournful tale her mother told,</L>
<L>Of what her faithless fortune promis'd once,<MILESTONE N="200"/></L>

<L>Beyond the pomp of dress; for loveliness <MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,</L>
<L>But is when unadorn'd adorn'd the most.</L>
<L>Thoughtless of beauty, she was beauty's self,</L>
<L>Recluse amid the close-embowering woods.</L>
<L>As in the hollow breast of <HI>Appenine,</HI><MILESTONE N="210"/></L>
<L>Beneath the shelter of incircling hills,</L>

<L>By strong necessity's supreme command,</L>

<L>The charms her down-cast modesty conceal'd.</L>
<L>That very moment love and chaste desire</L>
<L>Sprung in his bosom, to himself unknown;</L>

<L>Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn,<MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
