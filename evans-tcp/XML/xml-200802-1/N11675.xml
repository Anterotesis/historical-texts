<P>THERE is nothing can afford such solid and ration∣al comfort in any undertaking, as a firm and un∣shaken confidence that the Lord Jehovah is on our side, and the cause we engage in, is the cause of God. As it lays the foundation of true, christian courage, so it ought to be the rule by which to walk and conduct ourselves. If we are zealously affected, it should always be in a good cause, and such as the God of Heaven will approve of. Unless we set out with this view, we have reason to expect nothing but disappointment in the issue. It must be ac∣knowledged by all, who profess to believe the being and perfections of a God, that there is not only a general, but particular providence, ordering and directing the affairs of our world, so as to subserve the wise ends of the divine go∣vernment. This being the state of the case, it must be a matter of the last importance to us, whether in a single or social capacity, that we have God our almighty friend and protector. This belief is undoubtedly implied in the parti∣cular application that has been made, to have a sermon preached, suited to the present times and adapted in a pe∣culiar manner to the circumstance of such present, as are ready to march into the field, gallantly to expose their lives in defence of our most invaluable rights and privileges. Now if God be for us, who may or can be against us? But if God be against us, what power can successfully engage in our defence?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="014758_0003_0F94DD8DC6E03930"/>
IN our context we have an account of Sennacherib's de∣scent upon Hezekiah's kingdom, together with the special care Hezekiah took to put himself in the best possible posture of defence. The means is ours, the success de∣pends upon God. Sennacherib was then the scourge of that part of the world, as Nebuchadnezzar was afterwards. God often raises up such instruments for the purpose of execut∣ing his will, and bringing about some important revolu∣tions. They are used as the rods of his anger, and when his work is done he casts them into the fire. Every step is taken by Hezekiah to check Sennacherib's march through his dominions. If we trust God with our safety it must be in the use of proper means, otherwise we tempt, not trust him.</P>
<P>IN the 6th verse the good King gathers the people to∣gether and speaks comfortably unto them. This was infinitely better calculated to inspire both officers and sol∣diers with fresh courage to go into the field, than horrid oaths and imprecations. It is most certainly a matter of supreme consequence that such as have the principal direc∣tion of an army be men of God, that they may inspire their soldiery with true christian courage.</P>
<P>BE strong, &amp;c. q. d. Do not basely shrink back in an hour of danger, but resolve to hold it out to the last man. Let the soldiers quit themselves like men, make good their parts, stand to their arms, and display their valour equal to the goodness of the cause. Like a General who displays his banners under the Lord of Hosts, he encourages them with the most animating considerations, that however numerous and formidable the army was that came against them, yet theirs exceeded. God, says he, is with us, and that is more than all the combined forces of the enemy. At best the arm of flesh is all that they can boast of, but with us is an irre∣sistable and omnipotent arm. We have a God in covenant, not only to help us, but to go before and fight our battles.</P>
<P>OBSERVATION. There is nothing tends so effectually to inspire with true courage as a lively impression of the pre∣sence and interposition of God.</P>
<P>IN the farther prosecution of the subject, I design, thro' divine aid, the following method.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="014758_0003_0F94DD8DC6E03930"/>
1st. TO shew wherein true Fortitude consists.</P>
<P N="2">2d. BY what method we are to judge of God's being on our side, to fight our battles.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THE grounds of confidence arising therefrom.</P>
<P>I. I am to shew you wherein true Fortitude consists.—In general it consists in a temper of mind disposing persons to perform brave and noble actions, without being daunted at the appearance of dangers or difficulties in the way. With much propriety therefore is this temper recommend∣ed to such as are engaged in the military life, as they must endure hardness, and lay their accounts to meet with many hardships in the discharge of their important trust. True Fortitude is indispensibly necessary to compleat a good sol∣dier. A poor pusillanimous soul is unfit for real service, and shrinks back in an hour of danger, when duty urges to action. The Heathen Moralists reckoned courage in war to be the highest display thereof, and that the soldier had the best opportunity to display his courage, as life, the dearest thing in the world, was risqued in war. There is natural Fortitude or Stoutness, a large share of which the ancient Romans possessed, which, however serviceable for the soldier, yet is essentially different from, and vastly in∣ferior to, the Fortitude I am explaining. Many mistake its true nature, and at best give us but a very feeble and imperfect notion thereof. There is no more illustrious display of real Fortitude than to encounter the vicious pre∣judices of the age we live in; to row against the current of corrupt customs, to be singly sober amidst those who mock at all goodness, virtue and piety; to reject the en∣ticements of kind but wicked companions; and especially to put to the torture and resolutely crucify one's own car∣nal inclinations: This requires a face of flint and an heart of steel, the spirit and courage of an hero, and the strength of a giant. especially by such as from the nature of their calling, plunge into a sea of temptation, and are perpetu∣ally dunned with the allurements of ensnaring companions. This, Gentlemen, as it is at the foundation of true Forti∣tude, so it is the best armour you can carry with you into the field. "Therefore quit yourselves like men, be strong,
<PB N="6" REF="014758_0004_0F94DD8E8DF10010"/>
take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against all the wiles of the Devil." Many whilst they have laid the world in blood and ashes, have had Victory chained to their chariot wheels wherever they turned, have been mean and base cowards, submitted to the tyranny of every unruly lust and appetite. The vic∣tory over carnal self, is more than to set flames to whole rowns, and level the proudest walls.</P>
<P>BUT to be particular—</P>
<P N="1">1st. TRUE courage does not consist in insensibility of danger, but nobly rising above it in our minds. There can be no display of courage, however great the danger, if persons are entirely insensible thereof. In vain may the person asleep upon a top-mast in time of a storm, al∣ledge that it was an instance of courage; or the drunkard standing upon the brink of an awful precipice. Neither will it be characteristic of true courage for persons to plunge into thickest dangers, without a proper sense there∣of, and a mind ready prepared to meet every event. The more quick our sense of danger, the more true heroism in engaging therein, as it manifests a clear sense of duty and our fixed resolution to persevere.</P>
<P N="2">2d. NEITHER does true Fortitude consist in banishing all fear. The fear of God is not only consistent with, but at the very foundation of true courage. There is no such hero as the christian hero, nor is any thing of equal effica∣cy to encourage us to meet death, as the fear of God up∣on our hearts. I fear many of our gentlemen officers and soldiers are accustomed to esteem it an instance of cowardice to fear and serve God, and therefore cast off all fear and restrain prayer before him. This is not courage but teme∣rity or rashness. "What, not fear him who can kill both soul and body and cast them into hell for ever?" Not to fear God is to be a servant of sin and slave to every un∣ruly lust. Thus we often see that sober and discreet youths, as soon as they enter the army grow debauched, learn to profane God's holy name, as though cursing and swearing were vices licensed by the God of Heaven. I hope better things of you, Gentlemen, yet as a faithful friend I must warn you.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="014758_0004_0F94DD8E8DF10010"/>
3. NEITHER does it consist in exposing ourselves to un∣necessary danger. Our courage ought to be exercised in conjunction with christian prudence, so as not to rush into danger unless a sense of duty calls. To plunge our∣selves into the most imminent danger where the object to be obtained is very inconsiderable, and the prospect of ob∣taining even that little, doubtful, would be injudicious and rash. Persons may throw away their lives under the mistaken notion of fortitude, to perpetuate their names, and gain immortal renown. When the call is clear, and the object to be obtained, glorious, no danger should be avoided—the greatest difficulties submitted to.</P>
<P N="4">4. TRUE courage then consists in a free and chearful disposition to encounter the greatest dangers, when there is an evident call in the providence of God. This ought to be the grand object of our attention, and at the foun∣dation of every hazardous undertaking. A consciousness of this animates the soul, and makes it rise above undue fear in the discharge of the most arduous duties. There is nothing will make persons more determined to encoun∣ter danger and play the man, than a firm persuasion that we are on the Lord's side, and that the cause we espouse is the cause of heaven. In such circumstances ten men will drive an hundred, and an hundred put a thousand to flight. An army so principled goes into the field resolved upon death or victory.</P>
<P>WITH what a divine enthusiasm were Israel led to en∣gage all their enemies, under the animating addresses of their Generals, Moses and Joshua? <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxi. 6. "Be strong and of a good courage, fear not nor be afraid of them: For the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee." To the same purpose, Josh. i. 9. "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage, be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee whi∣ther soever thou goest." With such views, Gentlemen, ought you to go into the field as the most signal proof of your true courage!</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="8" REF="014758_0005_0F94DD8F4A2342B8"/>
5. TRUE courage manifests itself in suppressing anxious and distracting fears about what is future. It is enough that he is engaged in the path of duty, and therefore leaves what is future in the hand of God. It is the part of a coward to shrink from present duty for fear of future ills. The coward often fears where there is no real dan∣ger, and cries. There is a lion in the street. He perplex∣es himself with imaginary evils, and represents real ones much more frightful than they are in themselves. But the brave soldier does not flinch at the prospect of future hardships; he has laid his accounts to endure hardness as a good soldier, and so stands ready prepared to meet them.</P>
<P N="6">6. TRUE Fortitude will discover itself in a vigorous ap∣plication to our work, notwithstanding the stated and constant difficulties and oppositions that stand in the way. There is a perseverance absolutely necessary, and that when we may be foiled once and again. It does not dis∣pirit the truly magnanimous soldier notwithstanding he may meet with a variety of discouragements and repulses; he persists so long as the object appears attainable, and does not sink under a temporary check. He resolves not to quit the field until, under God, he puts the armies of the aliens to flight and comes off a complete conqueror. He is encouraged to pursue the cause from a clear con∣viction that he fights under Jehovah's banner and that he will be crowned with success at last.</P>
<P N="7">7. TRUE Fortitude consists in an uniform stedfastness of conduct amidst all the trials and dangers we meet with. There can be no display of courage when danger is not near; many talk big when dangers are at a distance, but let them be called forth to meet them, they will slink into a corner and basely betray the cause, when the greatest need to stand forth. But cool courage and real fortitude encreases and that in proportion to the danger. He quits not his post, flinches not his ground, nor turns his back upon the opposing enemy. Though he might have had his fears before the scene of action; though he might not have had so much false confidence as many others; though he might meet danger with a trembling hand, yet if he
<PB N="9" REF="014758_0005_0F94DD8F4A2342B8"/>
stands his ground in the heat of battle, he gives the most unequivocal proof of his real Fortitude. It has often been remarked of some of the bravest soldiers, that they have come into the field with a trembling hand, and yet have performed wonders. No punishment can be too great for the base coward who either deserts or meanly turns his back in the hour of battle. Upon that moment may hang the fate of an empire; upon that single en∣gagement the liberties, both civil and religious, of an whole continent. This, my dear Gentlemen, will be your indispensible duty if called to action. Remember that the liberties of unborn millions may hang suspended on the fate of a single hour—To desert the cause or basely betray the important trust, would leave an indelible blot upon your names and your posterity to the latest ages. Thus I have attempted to open up the nature of true Fortitude, and trust that God will inspire your souls with that noble spirit, who are singling yourselves out in de∣fence of our invaded rights.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed in the</P>
<P>II HEAD, To shew you by what method we are to judge of God's being on our side, to fight our battles.</P>
<P>AS a rational conviction of this is at the foundation of true courage, so it becomes all those who embark in the present interesting dispute, narrowly to examine and im∣partially to weigh matters, left they might be found to fight against God. As nothing can animate equal to the consciousness of a good cause, so on the other hand no thought can be more sinking, no reflection more chilling, than an apprehension that we have all the armed hosts of Heaven to engage with. We are embarking in a most important affair, a matter that will draw after it the most interesting consequences both to Great-Britain and the Colonies, in uniting to oppose the British arms. It high∣ly concerns us then seriously to consider the matter, so as to proceed upon just principles. Would to God that each enlisting in the American service, was first enlisted under the Lord Jesus Christ, so that whether life or death, eternal glory, as the reward, might be their portion? I
<PB N="10" REF="014758_0006_0F94DD9007D6DDD0"/>
fear many embarking in the present interesting dispute, do not sufficiently weigh the matter, whether it be a righteous or an unrighteous cause—A good cause may be very improperly engaged in; there is a curse pronounced upon those who do the work of the Lord deceitfully, as well as upon such who keep back their swords from blood. In order then to assist you in this important point, let me just premise, that we are not to expect any extraordinary revelation from Heaven or miraculous interposition in or∣der to determine whether God be on our side; notwith∣standing the great Jehovah was wont in former times to reveal to his servants the Prophets, the issue of certain engagements, and that Israel would assuredly prevail; yet as the canon of sacred writ is now closed, and the spirit of prophecy ceased, it would be unwarrantable presumption to expect such a revelation to mark out the line of our conduct. We are carefully to look into God's word, and mark the steps of divine conduct in order to form a judgment and determine whether we have sufficient rea∣son to believe that God will go forth and fight our battles. But to proceed—</P>
<P N="1">1st THE cause must be good. Without this we have no reason to expect that God will interest himself in our favour, that he will go forth with our armies and fight our battles. True, God may suffer an unrighteous cause to prosper for a while, to subserve the wise ends of his go∣vernment. The rod of the wicked may lay upon the lot of the righteous for a time, but it will most assuredly be removed. There is a very material difference between God's permitting an unrighteous cause for a season to prosper, and his protecting and defending a good one. A bad cause will fail at last, and God will take glory to himself in bringing good out of evil. Now, brethren, may we not appeal to God in the present struggle, that our cause is good? We are not carried through an haughty and wanton spirit to seek for larger dominions, or invade the property of others. We only desire in a quiet and peaceable manner to enjoy the fruits of our own industry
<PB N="11" REF="014758_0006_0F94DD9007D6DDD0"/>
and labor, and have some little peculium, or stock, we can call our own, without being taxed by a corrupt Par∣liament, in which we have no representation, nor from our local distance ever can have. We asked for no additional privileges, but content with the Charter Rights under which we claimed, felt no disposition to break off our connection with Britain, if it could with safety be preserved. We only insisted upon, as being our indisputable right, the privilege we had time imme∣morial enjoyed "of eating every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and to drink every one of his own cistern." Is it not the simple voice of na∣ture that this privilege we should still enjoy? And is it not agreeable to all our Charters and the very genius of the British Constitution, that no money should be filched from us without our own consent? This is a birthright inherit∣ance, and we are loudly called upon by God and Nature to hand it down to posterity. Hence then it appears that the attack is unjustly made upon our property, and we stand acquitted before God and the World to defend it at the expence of blood. As to the antiquated doctrine of passive-obedience and non-resistance, it has been suffici∣ently exploded by many eminent writers, both ancient and modern—it is such a wilful attack upon the natural rights of mankind, that it is scarcely entitled to a serious refut∣ation. We neither deserve the blessings of civil nor reli∣gious Liberty, if we can see them wrested from us without a struggle.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps some might object and say, it is only a dis∣pute about civil property; the object is not or sufficient importance to run the risque of loss of blood. To this I reply, that time would fail me to enumerate the long and black catalogue of ills that will unavoidably ensue if we tamely give up this one privilege, of being taxed by our own Representatives. Our estates, our all that we have for the support of our wives and children, must be laid at the feet of a bloody Ministry and packed Parliament, for the very purpose of enslaving us more and more, by sup∣porting
<PB N="12" REF="014758_0007_0F94DD90C69BCD90"/>
porting over ourselves swarms of court sycophants and hun∣gry leeches, who would never be contented until they had drained the last penny from our purses. Add to all this what the Reverend Synod of New-York and Philadel∣phia justly observed in their last pastoral letter, "that civil and religious Rights are so intimately connected together, that where one is given up the other falls of course." Let us for a moment look into the reigns of the Charles's and James's, and we will find that when religious liberties were attacked, the source of dispute at that time, civil property was rendered precarious and insecure. Nothing more com∣mon than sequestrations, confiscations, imprisonments, ba∣nishments, and death itself, in all its hideous forms of terror. Thus it will hold vice versa—I am clearly con∣vinced, that if we submit in the present dispute, liberty of conscience will be next invaded by that lordly Court and corrupt Parliament. There is a strong propensity in hu∣man nature for such as are in authority to lord it over those beneath them, and to have not only the civil but religious privileges of others solely at their disposal.</P>
<P>THIS renders our dispute with Great-Britain of the ut∣most importance to all of every denomination; a dispute worth expending millions upon, and hazarding the lives of thousands, to transmit fair to our posterity the blessings of civil and religious liberty. Is it not agreeable to the divine mind that we should be free, and enjoy the inesti∣mable blessing of worshipping God according to the dic∣tates of conscience, without the fear of man, which caus∣eth a snare? certainly it is. If so, then the cause is God's, and embarking in the present dispute, we fight the Lord's battles. Will he not then go before and succeed our arms?</P>
<P N="2">2. IT also supposes that we engage in a good cause from just motives and right principles. Without this we have not sufficient ground to expect that God will succeed our attempts and crown our arms with success, at least for the present. This appears agreeable to the general series of the divine conduct in former ages. How often did victory decide on the part of Israel's enemies, notwith∣standing
<PB N="13" REF="014758_0007_0F94DD90C69BCD90"/>
they were heathens? There is an actual curse pronounced upon such as do the work of the Lord de∣ceitfully. Would to God that in this particular we had still clearer evidence of God's being on our side, and that persons in suing for office did not so much study their own things! Undoubtedly the prevalence of vice and neglect of God and religion, both in our armies and elsewhere, is matter of deep lamentation, and is a reason why we may expect that God will suffer us to meet with several re∣pulses in the present dispute, in order that the glory of his power and rich grace may appear the more illustrious in finally crowning us with success. Yet I cannot but ap∣prehend that the fears of some are too much awakened upon this consideration, and are ready to conclude that from the present decay of religion and growth of impiety, God designs to give us entirely up and render us a prey to the enemy. I am not of that sentiment, as God in his adorable providence suffers a state, or nation, to arrive at a certain pitch both of greatness and impiety, before he gives them up to their foes. Now I think it must appear evident to every attentive observer, that the Colonies are arrived to neither that pitch of greatness nor yet impiety that length of time may bring about. Wealth is usually a fore-runner of vice, and those cities which have been the marts of trade, have generally imported foreign fashions and sinful customs. I trust that the present struggle will serve to humble the pride of our Colonies, and that who∣ever lives will see glorious days in America consequent up∣on this black cloud that now hangs over us. Besides, there are still some favorable symptoms that God is with us and that he will fight our battles, if we consider that we have engaged in this war, not with an entire dependance upon the arm of flesh, but have been called upon frequently to humble ourselves before God, with fasting and with prayer, to repent of all our sins and turn unto the Lord our God. I trust there are thousands and tens of thousands embark∣ing in the present war with the best and purest of motives, although I doubt not interest and honor are the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="14" REF="014758_0008_0F94DD918C899840"/>
motives with many. I sincerely believe that the praying part both in Great-Britain and America are interested on the side of American liberty. I doubt not many prayers are this day ascending up to the throne of grace, which I trust will enter into the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth, in our behalf.</P>
<P N="3">3d. WHEN God interests himself on any one side, the schemes and machinations of those in the opposition are turned into foolishness. Thus, Job v. 12. 13. 
 <Q>He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: And the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</Q>
I think it must appear plain to the most superficial observer that many of the counsels of the British senate have been foolishness, and by no means calculated to answer the purpose they had in view. This confession is extorted from the Ministry them∣selves in their last debates. The very measures taken to divide the Colonies have been over ruled to complete their union. Thus it was in the case of the stamp-act, under the specious name of raising a revenue for our own protection. The varnish was soon rubbed off; the horrid enslaving scheme was soon detected, and the Colonies from New-Hampshire to Georgia took the alarm. Here was a chain to bind the whole Colonies, a plan laid to sweep away the liberties of more than three millions of American subjects at once, whereas had they begun with a single Colony the measure might have ensured them of an easy conquest.—The rigorous steps taken against the colony of Massachusetts, and town of Boston, laying it under the most into∣lerable and unrighteous proscriptions, destroying its trade and blocking up its harbour, enkindled the indignation of every son or liberty on the Continent. Had the vindictive statutes been less cruel, they would have better answered the purpose of enslaving the Colonies. In short, it would greatly exceed the limits of a sermon to enter into a mi∣nute detail of the several steps taken by the Ministry and Parliament of Great-Britain, which have proved entirely
<PB N="15" REF="014758_0008_0F94DD918C899840"/>
subversive of their favorite scheme. Now does not this shew very clearly that God is against them, and consequently on our side? This argument receives additional weight, if we also consider the many illustrious characters God has raised up in defence of American liberty both in Great-Britain and the Colonies, together with the remarkable wisdom and prodigious extent of knowledge manifested in all the productions of our Honorable Continental Congress. Let the encomium of Earl Chatham, that master of poli∣tics, eloquence and found reasoning, serve to immortalize their names and transmit the memory of that illustrious bo∣dy with a grateful remembrance to latest posterity. Speaking of their arduous task, he says, "When your Lordships look at the papers transmitted us from America, when you consider their decency, firmness and wisdom, you cannot but respect their cause, and wish to make it your own—For myself I must declare and avow, that in all my read∣ing and observation, and it has been my favorite study;—I have read Thucidides, and have studied and admired the master states of the world, that for solidity of reason∣ing, force of sagacity and wisdom of conclusion, under such a complication of different circumstances, no nation or body of men can stand in preference to the General Continental Congress in Philadelphia."—May they long continue to honour the important trust, to gain the applause of the wise and the good, and be the constant care of an indulgent heaven!</P>
<P>THUS then it appears from those particulars, as well as the signal success we have been blessed with, that God is on our side to fight our battles.</P>
<P N="4">4th. IT is usual for the great Jehovah to interest him∣self for the enlargement of young and growing states. Thus we find that he has fought their battles and made them victorious over antient and powerful nations. To this purpose let us observe the conduct of God towards Israel of old, in fighting their battles and securing them in the quiet possession of the promised land. Thus, Psal. cvi. 43. 
 <Q>Many times did he deliver them, but they
<PB N="16" REF="014758_0009_0F94DD9245560720"/>
 provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</Q>
—So it was with the Protestant States in Germany in Charles the Fifth's time, Emperor of Ger∣many and King of Spain—The States of Holland and the Independent Cantons of Switzerland demonstrate the same, that God takes care of a young and forming people.</P>
<P>IT has been remarkably the case with the Isle of Bri∣tain, until it arose to its late glory and opulence. The scale seems now to be turned, and God says of that nation as of Israel, 
 <Q>Thee only have I known of all the Fami∣lies of the earth, therefore will I punish thee for all thine iniquities.</Q>
—Now it is very evident that the Co∣lonies are but in their infant state, and are very far from having arrived at all the firmness and manhood God de∣signs. If we look down thro' time but for half a century, to what a prodigious pitch of wealth and greatness will the Continent of North-America have arrived! I am firmly of the sentiment that its future growth will be much more rapid than the past; many reasons might be offered which I must omit here. What countless millions of land yet un∣cultivated! What a boundless extent of country traversed only by savages and wild beasts! Now surely God did not make such a large share of our globe for nought, or only to be the haunts of wild beasts, and possessed by the naked untutored Indians. The Gospel of Jesus Christ has only glanced upon the shores of this vast Continent, and we may believe that God designs the settlement of its remotest boundaries for the enlargement of his son's kingdom; that notable passage in Psal. lxxx. 8. 9. 10. Verses, has been and will be still more eminently fulfilled in North-America: 
 <Q>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: Thou hast cast out the Heathen, and planted it. Thou preparedst room before it. and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with the sha∣dow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.—She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="014758_0009_0F94DD9245560720"/>
I BELIEVE our American Continent, as it has not yet been stained with the blood of martyrs, will be an asylum for the persecuted over all Europe to fly to. America corresponds to the account we have of the wilderness to which the Church was driven to seek protection from the fury of the Dragon, Rev. xii. 13. 14. 
 <Q>And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecu∣ted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might flee into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</Q>
It is more than probable that this scripture had an eminent fulfilment when our ancestors fled, not from the embraces of the mother, but from the cruelty of the monster, and took sanctuary in the wilderness of America. Thus it was when a number of precious souls landed on the bleak shore of Plymouth in the rigid month of December, without pro∣visions—without houses; but God, as he designed them for a feed to this new world, procured them favour with the na∣tives, who, as I have been told, cheerfully resigned their huts to entertain the newly arrived emigrants. It appears, therefore, that the Church is not yet arrived to its per∣fection in America, but will extend wider and wider, un∣til it has reached to the Pacific ocean—Pleasing prospect! to survey churches rising and the gospel preached, where nothing is now heard but the yells of wild beasts and nightly orgies of savages! Who would not then stand forth in defence of our liberties, so essentially necessary for the progress of religion and rapid settlement of the Colonies? Who would not run the risk of spilling some blood for the enlargement of Christ's mystical body the Church, which he purchased with his own most precious blood? Glorious cause, my dear brethren, we are embark∣ed in, worthy of a struggle! Yea, we ought to rejoice that God is likely to honour us in making a noble stand for the defence and enlargement of Christ's kingdom.—Thus, then, it appears that it is the cause of God we are engaged in, so need not be dispirited, as he will go before and sight our battles. But this leads me to the
<PB N="18" REF="014758_0010_0F94DD930A41A410"/>
III THING proposed, namely, to offer some grounds of security arising from God's being on our side.</P>
<P N="1">1st. HIS most perfect knowledge of all possible events, lays a foundation of encouragement. There is not an hair of our heads but is numbered; his infinite knowledge puts him beyond the possibility of a mistake in the whole of his conduct. He at one clear and intuitive view sees all things, with all that infinite variety of their connections; there is not a single danger to which we are exposed, but he fore∣sees and can counteract. Human wisdom is not able to guard against every occurrence that may turn up to dis∣concert their schemes; hence we find confusion and disap∣pointment frequently attending the wisest human counsels. But Jehovah is unerring, and therefore claims counsel and sound judgment as his own. This, therefore, must afford the most solid satisfaction, that we have one on our side of infinite knowledge to discern all future events and to di∣rect matters so as to turn the counsels of our enemies into foolishness.</P>
<P N="2">2d. GOD has not only the most perfect knowledge of all persons and things, but has the secret management of all in his own hand. His kingdom ruleth over all, and the hearts of Kings and Princes are in his hand; he rules by a secret and irresistible sway in the armies of heaven and amongst the inhabitants of the earth. The reins of uni∣versal government are in his hand. The wheels of nature, however intricate, are under his direction; storms and thunder obey him; the elements are all subservient to his pleasure; for those who are fighting for him, he can even suspend the laws of nature, arrest the sun in his rapid course, until his victories are gained. All creatures are at his nod, so that they that are with us, God being on our side, are more than those that are against us. He can employ all the hosts of heaven, can give commission to a single destroying angel to cut off in one night an hundred and fourscore thousand, as in Sennacherib's army. Who then would be afraid to embark in the cause of such an illustrious leader, who has all power in heaven and on earth in his hand? Nay, who would not rush into thickest
<PB N="19" REF="014758_0010_0F94DD930A41A410"/>
dangers, when they are assured that the cause is the cause of God, and that there is not a bullet, as King William used to say, but has its billet?</P>
<P N="3">3. HE is bound by his faithfulness to stand by and sup∣port a righteous cause.—The righteous Lord loveth righteousness. Although he may suffer a good cause to meet with opposition, and the designs of wicked men for a while to prosper, yet 
 <Q>he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision; then shall he speak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</Q>
Thus God promises to Joshua, 
 <Q>One man of you shall chase a thousand; for the Lord your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised. So shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.</Q></P>
<P>LASTLY, Omnipotence is engaged on our side. God is not only unerring in his counsels, but omnipotent to put them into execution. He can cast the wicked down to hell, and all the nations that forget God. He is, in short, a strong rock for defence; he teaches our hands to war, and our fingers to fight. In one word, he is the Lord strong in battle.</P>
<P>IMPROVEMENT.—1st. This subject shews us the great necessity of personal covenanting with God and enlisting under the Lord Jesus Christ, as the glorious Captain of our salvation. It would be an affecting thought, that however glorious the cause in which we are engaged, and however ready to embark therein from certain considera∣tions, as being the cause of Liberty, yet we ourselves should be servants to sin and slaves to lust. This is a mat∣ter in which every soul present is concerned; we have, my dear brethren, all of us enemies to conflict with which we cannot avoid, and which by no power or skill of our own we can defeat. We have to wrestle not only with flesh and blood, but with principalities and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places. There is a spiritual armour we must put on to come off conquerors; there is a glorious General we must enlist under, to ensure us of victory. No leader inferior to the Lord Jesus Christ, who
<PB N="20" REF="014758_0011_0F94DD93CBA9D700"/>
has himself spoiled principalities and powers can put Satan under our feet. Here is the greatest victory we ever can gain; a victory over the world, our own lusts and all the internal hosts of hell. As the victory is great, so the prize to every overcomer is also great. 
 <Q>To him that over∣cometh,</Q>
says the Captain of our salvation, 
 <Q>Will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also over∣came, and am sit down with my Father in his throne. <BIBL>Rev. iii. 21.</BIBL></Q>
He that overcometh shall inherit all things. Shall heroes and generals contend for honors of a day; for the laurel that must sooner or later decay, and shall not we fight and strive for an inheritance incorruptible, unde∣filed and that fadeth not away?</P>
<P N="2">2d. THIS subject shews us of what infinite moment it is in the present struggle to have God on our side to go before us and to fight our battles. The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong. If God be for us we need not be dismayed at all the armed legions that are coming against us. At most it is but an arm of flesh; and 
 <Q>cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord. <BIBL>Jer. xvii 5.</BIBL></Q>
See how Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts were cast into the sea, 
 <Q><BIBL>Exod. xv. 10.</BIBL> Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name.</Q>
What a signal display of his power in our behalf at the Newfoundland fishery, and also in the river Thames, when his winds blew and they sank like lead in the great waters!</P>
<P N="3">3d. IS it the cause of God, as you have heard, that we are engaged in? Hence learn how ready we ought to be to embark therein. Cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood in such a cause. There can, strictly speaking, be no neutrality in the present case—he that is not with us must be against us. I fear many will shrink back, and under some pretext desert the cause, when their assistance will be most needed. Be not dismayed, my dear brethren; if it is the cause of God, as you have heard, success is certain. What though we should meet with
<PB N="21" REF="014758_0011_0F94DD93CBA9D700"/>
many repulses? The struggle is of such vast importance to us and unborn millions, that every lover of God, reli∣gion and posterity, should vie one with another who should be foremost in action. If we fall in the field, we die as secure as if on our knees to God in prayer. If we are prepared to die on our beds, so are we in the field. It will be an easy translation to go from fighting to wear∣ing an unfullied crown of glory. Every true christian, having embarked in the present cause as the cause of God and religion, if he dies in the field, will die a martyr for Christ and will receive a martyr's crown. Route then, my dear brethren; quit yourselves like men; stand ready to march into the field when God and your country call.</P>
<P N="4">4th. BUT I must address myself in a particular manner to you, Gentlemen Officers and Privates, who appear before us to day, engaged in your country's cause.</P>
<P>FIRST, as to the Officers—</P>
<P>PERMIT me to tell you, Gentlemen, that, under God, much will depend upon your prudent, wise and manly behaviour. You have not only to direct your own con∣duct, but the conduct and behaviour of those under your care. You are to consider that the cause you are engaged in is the cause of God, and that you are to conduct your∣selves worthy of such a glorious undertaking. Remember that you are not called out to fight the Devil's battles, but the battles of the Lord of hosts. See to it, then, that you do honour to the cause, and not let it suffer through your default. As to your private conduct, see that it be sober, decent and respectable. Never look upon it as a qualifi∣cation for officers fighting the Lord's battles, to curse and swear, and take God's name in vain. Authority will be better secured by your manly and religious behaviour, than by all the imprecations you can use to your fellow men. Suffer not yourselves to be governed by appetite, fancy or humour, but by reason and conscience; attend to the dispositions and characters of those under your care, that you may be the better fitted to regulate their conduct; carefully attend to the mode of conduct best adapted to the variety of circumstances you may be in; consider what
<PB N="22" REF="014758_0012_0F94DD948B521628"/>
is decorous and what indecorous, and what is usually ap∣proved of by the most wise and judicious in such circum∣stances.</P>
<P>BE grave and sedate in opposition to a light and frothy temper; let a graceful composedness appear even in your gayest seasons, and make it evident that your minds are under a firm impression of the divine presence. Be not slothful, but diligent in your calling; be resolute, quit yourselves like men, and above all be resolute in religion and determined that for your part, let others do as they will, you will serve the Lord. Let it appear that you dare be religious even in a camp. Not that I would have you always gloomy or melancholy; no, the gravity I recom∣mend is consistent with chearfulness, and even supposes it. Serve the Lord with gladness; thou meetest him that re∣joiceth and worketh righteousness. I would not be under∣stood as though I meant to cut off innocent and natural mirth, but only to direct it into a proper channel; this, as an inspired writer observes, may do good, but is to be used as a medicine. Avoid excess either in eating or drinking; deny yourselves of all irregular and sensual gratifications. Seek not the vain applause of mortals, but study to have the testimony of a good conscience. Be valiant and cou∣ragious in the hour of battle, if called to it; never flinch from a dangerous post, when duty urges you on; play the man for your God and Country; be prepared to meet every event, and try to have God your God and everlast∣ing portion.—It may be the last address I ever shall make you; I would that it might be remembered. Let me sum up all in a few words—Endure hardness as good sol∣diers of Jesus Christ; put ye on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against all the wiles of the Devil; be faithful unto the death, and ye have the promise of Christ that ye shall receive a crown of life.</P>
<P>BUT I must speak a word to the Soldiers—Happy consideration if ye were all enlisted under the Lord Jesus Christ! Let me intreat you seriously to consider the im∣portance of the cause you have engaged in; remember as you have heard, that it is the cause of God. Be regular
<PB N="23" REF="014758_0012_0F94DD948B521628"/>
in your conduct and submissive to those under whose im∣mediate care you are put; assume no undue airs of import∣ance, nor affect to be noticed by those about you; be not arrogant, but let your behaviour manifest a proper defer∣ence to your superiors; never affect to appear above your rank, nor be ashamed of it; take heed, as you are to min∣gle with persons of every character, not to be tempted by profane fops, to treat the great concerns of religion with contempt. Carry a favour of religion with you wherever you are; take heed of fleshly lusts that war against the soul; love not ease and sloth, but endure hardness; be not nice or delicate in eating or drinking; guard against immodest and unchaste conversation; let no corrupt com∣munication proceed out of your mouth; fornication and all uncleaness, let it not be named amongst you as becomes Christians; avoid foolish talking and filthy jesting; be valiant for the cause you are engaged in; never shrink in an hour of battle. And now, my dear Gentlemen Officers and Soldiers, may the divine protection be your shield in an hour of danger; may you have success equal to the goodness of your cause; may you have the pleasing re∣flection of being improved by the God of heaven for se∣curing liberty both civil and religious to this new world; may the Lord go before you, direct you in all your ways, animate you in every important enterprise, guard your heads from the winged messengers of death, and bring you at last to his heavenly kingdom. I must take my leave, and collect my whole soul in bidding you an hearty farewel.</P>
<P>BUT I must have done with a word to the assembly at large. Numbers of you, my dear brethren, are not like to be called into the field of action; But is there nothing incumbent upon you to do? Are not such as are hazard∣ing their lives in our common defence entitled to your esteem, prayers and assistance? Prayer has done much in such cases; the fervent prayer of the righteous man avail∣eth much: Thus it was in the case or Moses, when Aaron and H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r held up his hands, doubtless in a praying posture Israel prevailed. Every one present who has liberty
<PB N="24" REF="014758_0013_0F94DD9547422F50"/>
or property to defend, is deeply concerned in the present struggle. Liberty or Slavery is to be transmitted to our numerous offspring. This Continent will either be the glory of the earth, or a place of more than Egyptian bondage. It is worth while to exert ourselves, and not suffer our land to be over-run with Slavery and Tyranny. Let not posterity have reason to curse us, when we shall be lying in the silent grave. Let us imitate the conduct of good Jehoshaphat, 
 <Q><BIBL>2 Chron. xx. 12.</BIBL> O our God wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that cometh against us, nei∣ther know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</Q>
May the Lord direct our eyes to himself; may he go be∣fore and fight our battles; may he once more restore peace in our land, through Jesus. AMEN.</P>
