<BYLINE>Thus Paraphrased by the Incomparable Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>TO this vile Crue you may the PIRATE add</L>
<L>Who puts to Sea the Merchant to invade,</L>
<L>And reaps the Profit of another's Trade.</L>
<L>He sculks behind some Rock, or swiftly flies</L>
<L>From Creek to Creek, rich Vessels to surprize.</L>
<L>By this ungodly Course the Robber gains,</L>
<L>And lays up so much Wealth, that he disdains</L>
<L>And mocks the poor, unprofitable Toil,</L>
<L>Of those, who plant the Vine, or till the Soil.</L>

<HEAD>A Remarkable RELATION OF A <HI>Cockatrice</HI> crush'd in the Egg.</HEAD>
<P>A Vessel of that sort which they call, a <HI>Snoe,</HI> belonging to certain Merchants in <HI>Bristol,</HI> and commanded by <HI>John Green,</HI> of that City, sailed from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> some time in <HI>April,</HI> 1726. bound for <HI>Guinea.</HI> The Boat∣swain, <HI>William Fly,</HI> having before concerted with some aboard, (in a way of Revenge, they said, for <HI>Bad Usage</HI>) the Destruction of the <HI>Master</HI> and the <HI>Mate,</HI> and the proper <HI>Consequences,</HI> on May 27. a∣bout One a Clock in the Morning, he, with one <HI>Alexander Mitchel,</HI> went into the Cabin, and siezing on the Master, held his Hands, while <HI>Mitchel</HI> wounded him. Then they hawled him up; who perceiving their Intention to throw him overboard, beg'd, <HI>For the Lord's sake, don't throw me overboard; For if you do, you throw me into Hell immediately.</HI> But <HI>Fly</HI> bid him say, <HI>Lord, Have Mercy on my Soul</HI>! And when he siezed the Mainsheets with his Hand, to prolong his Time, the merciless Monsters, with a Cooper's Broad-axe, cut off his Hand, and threw him over-board. While this was a doing, one <HI>Samuel Cole,</HI> presently assisted with <HI>Mitchel</HI> and one <HI>Winthrop,</HI> secured the Mate, whose Name was
<PB N="2" REF="002779_0004_0FE5F5906AFF4B30"/>
<HI>Thomas Jenkins,</HI> and brought him upon Deck, tel∣ling him, <HI>that he should go after the Master.</HI> Accor∣dingly, having first cut him down the Shoulder with a Broad-axe, they threw him over, just be∣fore the Main Shrouds. After he was thrown o∣ver, he cried out unto the Doctor, <HI>For the Lord's sake, to fling him a Rope.</HI> But <HI>Fly</HI> soon secured the Doctor, and put him in Irons; and confined the Gunner also and the Carpenter, who were not for their Turn.</P>
<P>Two Days after this, they met one of the Ships, that came out in Company with <HI>Green,</HI> and hailing them, ask'd, How Captain <HI>Green</HI> did. They an∣swered, <HI>Very well! At your Service</HI>! But upon con∣sulting, whether they had best attack that Ship, they left her, in Consideration, That they had not Hands enough to Man her. So, they bore away for <HI>North-Carolina</HI>; Where, off Cape <HI>Hattaras</HI> Bar, on June 3. there lay a Sloop at Anchor, whereof the Commander was one whose Name is <HI>Fulker.</HI> Some of the Sloop's Hands went aboard <HI>Fly,</HI> who was now become the Captain of the <HI>Snoe,</HI> suppo∣sing them to want a Pilot. <HI>Fly</HI> commanded <HI>Fulker</HI> aboard, and informed him, <HI>They were Gentlemen of Fortune</HI>; and let him know, that they must have the <HI>Sloop,</HI> if it sailed better than the <HI>Snoe.</HI> The contrary Winds rendring the <HI>Sloop</HI> unable to be brought off, our New Captain fell into a great Passion, and swore he would burn her, and bring∣ing <HI>Fulker</HI> to the Geers, (who it seems, unadvised∣ly provoked them) inflicted a severe Scourging upon him. The Boats Crue, could not bring the <HI>Sloop</HI> any further than the Bar, but there she bilg'd and sank: and the Pirates endeavoured then to set
<PB N="3" REF="002779_0005_0FE5F5BCA8E6DEF8"/>
her on Fire, but could not make the Fire to take. <HI>Fulker</HI> and his Men, and his Passengers, were de∣tained Prisoners by <HI>Fly</HI>; But on June 5. they sail∣ed from thence; and on the Day following they saw a Ship commanded by one whose Name is <HI>Gale,</HI> bound from <HI>Barbados</HI> to <HI>Virginia.</HI> They could not come up with <HI>Gale</HI> till the next Morning; when they hoisted their <HI>Black Flag,</HI> and fired several Guns at the Ship; and there being little Wind▪ <HI>Gale</HI> struck; and <HI>Fly</HI> made the Men his Prisoners; but robbed the Ship only of several Sails, and some Cloaths and small Arms; and after a Captivity of Two Days released them; at the same time giving <HI>Fulker,</HI> and one of his Passengers, and a Servant, and <HI>Green</HI>'s Doctor, their Liberty. However they forceably detained one <HI>William Atkinson,</HI> who had been Commander of a Brigantine, but left her for a Passage home in <HI>Fulker,</HI> bound then for <HI>Boston</HI>: And who had often declared, That if the <HI>Pirates</HI> ever took him, he would humour them, till he could see his first Opportunity to rise upon them. They wanted him to be their <HI>Pilot,</HI> for the Coast of <HI>New-England</HI>; which they told him▪ he should be, or, <HI>They would blow his Brains out.</HI> It seems, they forgot, how bad a Coast <HI>New-England</HI> has been for <HI>Pirates</HI> to come upon! Off of <HI>Delaware Bay,</HI> they met a Sloop commanded by one <HI>Harris</HI> bound from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> having about Fifty Scotch-Irish Passengers aboard; which upon their hoisting of their <HI>Black Flag</HI> Surrendred unto them. After they had a little ransack'd the Vessel, and kept her twenty four Hours, they forced a Lusty Blade, one <HI>James Benbrook,</HI> from her, and so dismiss'd her. <HI>Fly</HI> bore away for <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> pretend∣ing
<PB N="4" REF="002779_0006_0FE5F5BFB3E82D70"/>
to Water there, and so away for <HI>Guinea</HI>; But the <HI>Pilot</HI> purposely miss'd the port, (whereat <HI>Fly</HI> was very angry,) and on June 23. bearing Eastward, they mett with a <HI>Fishing Schooner,</HI> on <HI>Browns</HI> Bank; from which upon <HI>Fly</HI>'s hoisting his <HI>Black Flag,</HI> and threatning to sink her, the Master came aboard them, &amp; <HI>Fly</HI> told him, he must have the <HI>Schooner,</HI> unless he could inform him, where to get a better Sailor. A∣bout Noon, they saw some other <HI>Schooners</HI>; and <HI>Fly</HI> sent that <HI>Schooner</HI> with seven hands after them. <HI>Fly</HI> (who had now entirely sold himself to the God of <HI>Ekron,</HI>) and Three other Pirates, whereof one (<HI>Samuel Cole</HI> aforesaid, was in Irons upon Sus∣picion of Mutiny, remained aboard the <HI>Snoe</HI>; and fifteen others that had been taken by him; namely, <HI>Fulkers</HI> Mate, a couple of his Boys, <HI>Green</HI>'s Gunner and Carpenter, five of <HI>Gale</HI>'s Men, <HI>Benbrook,</HI> Three Fishermen belonging to the <HI>Schooner,</HI> and our <HI>Atkin∣son.</HI> While the <HI>Pirates</HI> were gone upon their chase, there appeared in Sight several other Fishing-Ves∣sels; and <HI>Atkinson</HI> by telling <HI>Fly</HI> what he saw, drew him forward, from his two Loaden <HI>Guns,</HI> and <HI>Sword,</HI> which he had with him; and while <HI>Fly</HI> satt on the <HI>Windlace</HI> with his Prospective-Glass, <HI>Benbrook</HI> and <HI>Walker,</HI> (who had been <HI>Fulker</HI>'s Mate) upon the Direction from <HI>Atkinson,</HI> secured <HI>Fly,</HI> and put him in Irons; and <HI>Atkinson</HI> struck another of the <HI>Pirates</HI>; and with the Help of the Carpenter, soon confi∣ned the other Two. Thus they made themselves Masters of the <HI>Snoe</HI>; the rest of the Prisoners all the while standing unactive, not being made acquain∣ted with the Design, which was now managing for their Deliverance.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002779_0007_0FE5F5C28D52E380"/>On June 28. the Happy <HI>Captors</HI> brought in their <HI>New Captives</HI>; having <HI>taken them Captives, whose Captives they were.</HI> So, <HI>The Triumphing of the wicked,</HI> was <HI>but for a moment.</HI></P>
<P>And, the <HI>Special Court of Admiralty</HI> which the <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> has ordered for the Trial of <HI>Pirates,</HI> [Whereof the chief Judge, was the Honourable WILLIAM DUMMER Esqr. the Lievtenant Go∣vernour, and Commander in Chief, of the <HI>Massa∣chuset-Province,</HI>] quickly tried these <HI>Four Pyrates,</HI> and after plain and full Conviction, on July 3. pass'd the just <HI>Sentence of Death</HI> upon them; namely, upon <HI>William Fly,</HI> the upstart Captain, who was a Young man, about Seven and twenty years of old; <HI>Henry Greenville,</HI> a married Man about foriy seven years of Age; <HI>Samuel Cole,</HI> about Thirty seven years of Age, having a Wife and seven Children; And, <HI>George Condick,</HI> a Youth of Twenty, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>They were now cast into a place, Where, be∣sides the <HI>prayers,</HI> which abundance of Godly Chri∣stians made for them, That in <HI>the Destruction of the Flesh</HI> their <HI>Spirit</HI> might be <HI>Saved,</HI> great pains were taken, by the Ministers of City, to dispose them for a Return unto God.</P>
<P>Because, it may be Edifying to the <HI>Survivers,</HI> whatever it might be unto the <HI>Criminals,</HI> [Whereof one, appeared all along a very Hardened Wretch, and a Fearful Instance of Divine Dereliction,) here shall be inserted a Relation of <HI>Two Conferences</HI> with them.</P>

When we come to plead This, as we ought to do, GOD will Release us from the <HI>Pu∣nishment.</HI> Now mind Exceedingly! — You must cast yourselves in the Dust before the Lord, and weep to Him with unspeakable Agony, and plead at this rate before Him; — <HI>O Great GOD; Let me escape the Death due to me for my Sin, because my SAVI∣OUL has Dyed for me. Let the Blood which my SA∣VIOUR shed for His People, procure my Salvation from what my Sin has expos'd me to.</HI>— You will try to plead thus, and so Hope for <HI>Mercy,</HI> with a GOD <HI>Ready to Pardon.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must now Remember, That the <HI>Gates</HI> of the <HI>Holy City,</HI> will <HI>stand open</HI> for none but the <HI>Righteous Nation.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> of GOD will shut those <HI>Gates</HI> upon all that can't show a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which will fully come up to all the Demands of it. You must be owners of a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which has no Imper∣fection in it, or the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD which is the E∣verlasting and Unalterable <HI>Rule</HI> of it, will never ad∣mit you into <HI>Blessedness.</HI> What will you do in this aw∣ful case?</P>

<P><HI>Repentance will do for us, instead of it.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, It won't. — But, mind the only <HI>Re∣fuge,</HI> you must fly to. Oh! Fly to the <HI>City of Refuge,</HI> that is now to be set open for you. Even <HI>Wilful
<PB N="13" REF="002779_0015_0FE5F5E47B821D98"/>
Murderers,</HI> may enter there. — Our SAVIOUR is become our <HI>Surety.</HI> He had a most <HI>Holy Heart</HI>; He led a most <HI>Holy Life</HI>; He yielded a most per∣fect obedience to the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD. No <HI>Fault</HI> could ever be found in Him. This was to produce a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> for His People, Renouncing all De∣pendance on their own, to plead for their Accep∣tance with GOD. It was <HI>He</HI> that <HI>made</HI> the <HI>Law.</HI> It was for <HI>our sake</HI> that He put Himself under it. You never can make yourselves a <HI>Righteousness. You,</HI> of all Men Living, are Spoilt for <HI>That</HI>! But now, <HI>O what an Amazing Thing! You,</HI> as wretched as you are, have this <HI>Righteousness</HI> provided for you. You have now a Tender of it, as a <HI>Cord</HI> thrown out unto a drowning Man. <HI>You</HI>! —that were far from throwing out a <HI>Cord</HI> unto the poor Men, whom you cast into the Ocean to perish there! — Oh! Lay hold on this precious <HI>Cord</HI>; and thus pour out your Tears before the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>O Holy GOD, Tho' I am the most unrighteous Wretch that ever appear'd before thee, yet I desire JESUS CHRIST the Righteous, to be my Advocate in the Hea∣vens. That Righteous One has been and has done all that thy Law calleth for. For the sake of that Righteous∣ness, Oh! Let the Blessedness of the Righteous, be what this Lothsome Sinner shall arrive unto!</HI> Will you <HI>Con∣sider what I say,</HI> and beg of the Lord, that He would give the <HI>understanding</HI> of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; But if the <HI>Offering</HI> of your SAVIOUR, do avail for you, there will be produced a <HI>New Heart</HI> in you; Your <HI>Heart</HI> will now close with GOD; and you will make the <HI>Service</HI> of GOD, the the <HI>Chief End</HI> and <HI>Main Work</HI> of your Life. And
<PB N="14" REF="002779_0016_0FE5F5F1F50DECA8"/>
GOD will be to you, what you have heretofore vainly sought in <HI>Creatures.</HI> The <HI>Love</HI> of GOD will be <HI>Rooted</HI> in your Souls; and all the <HI>Branches</HI> of PI∣ETY will be found growing upon it. You will say, <HI>What have I any more to do with Idols?</HI> You will not <HI>Sin,</HI> to please the <HI>Flesh,</HI> or the <HI>World,</HI> or the <HI>Devil.</HI> You will <HI>have Respect unto all the Command∣ments of GOD.</HI> This <HI>Wisdom</HI> you <HI>lack</HI>; Alas, De∣stitute have you been of it, all your Days! But, the Direction is, <HI>If any Man lack Wisdom, let him ask it of GOD</HI>! Send up then, Oh! send up a Cry that shall pierce the Heavens; <HI>Lord, Bestow a New Heart upon me!</HI> You must always remember, <HI>With∣out Holiness no Man shall see the Lord.</HI> You cannot be Received into the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> if you have not first an <HI>Heavenly Heart. Heaven</HI> could not bear <HI>you</HI> to be in it; Nay, which is a dreadful word, <HI>You</HI> could not bear to be in <HI>Heaven,</HI> if you have not another <HI>Biass</HI> prevailing on your <HI>Heart,</HI> than what you have had, while you have been <HI>Wandring from the Way of understanding,</HI> and <HI>going astray from GOD in the Greatness of your Folly.</HI> You must therefore most Earnestly Beseech your SAVIOUR, to <HI>Unite</HI> you unto Himself, &amp; by His Good SPIRIT <HI>Quicken</HI> you for <HI>Living unto GOD</HI>: and <HI>fulfil in you all the good pleasure of His Goodness.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, I have in a <HI>few words</HI> given you the <HI>Sum of the Matter</HI>; which I hope, you will <HI>Think o∣ver,</HI> when I am departed from you. For <HI>one Con∣ference,</HI> thus much may be Enough, if you will try when I am withdrawn, to <HI>go over</HI> the <HI>Way of Life</HI> that has been set before you.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> will at this Time add only this <HI>One Remark.</HI> If you come to the <HI>Repentance</HI> that is unto <HI>Salvation,</HI> it
<PB N="15" REF="002779_0017_0FE5F5F306239820"/>
will appear, in <HI>Dispositions,</HI> that will be the Reverse of Those, which have push'd you on, to the <HI>Sins Repented</HI> of. I'l Illustrate it, with Two Instances.</P>
<P>First, That which push'd you on to Robberies and Piracies, was an Immoderate, Inordinate, Ir∣regular Desire of <HI>Worldly Possessions.</HI> Now, if you <HI>Repent,</HI> you will have a Disposition patiently to bear any <HI>Wants</HI> and <HI>Straits,</HI> that GOD may order for you; and rather suffer any <HI>Poverty</HI> and all sorts of <HI>Difficulties,</HI> than Sin, or do any Unlawful Thing, to gain the World. In this point how do you find yourselves disposed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Fly, — Be sure, I have nothing more to Expect from the World.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co. and, Gr:</SPEAKER>
<P>We <HI>hope, we should never do as we have done.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly, That which has push'd you on to <HI>Murders,</HI> as well as <HI>Robberies</HI> and <HI>Piracies,</HI> was an <HI>Hatred</HI> of your <HI>Brother,</HI> 'Tis what you have carri∣ed on to the last Extremity, A most <HI>Finished Ha∣tred</HI>; Now if you Repent, you will have a Dispo∣sition full of <HI>Benignity; Good will towards Men,</HI> will sweeten your Minds; You will have an Hearty <HI>Love</HI> to your Neighbour. You will <HI>Wish well</HI> to e∣very one, whose <HI>Welfare,</HI> is Consistent with the public Safety.</P>
<P>Now, shall I Enquire after this point also; How you find yourselves disposed in it? Say— <HI>Fly</HI> par∣ticularly, Do you say; Are there any in the world, which you don't wish well to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fly. <HI>Yes; There is one Man, that I don't, and I can't wish well to! It is a Vain Thing to ly, If I should say, that I forgive that Man, and that I wish him well,
<PB N="16" REF="002779_0018_0FE5F5F618951F10"/>
I should ly against my Conscience, and add Sin to Sin.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, Man, Thou dost <HI>add Sin to Sin.</HI> To bear <HI>Malice</HI> against your Neighbour, or be unable <HI>wish him well,</HI> tho' it be not a <HI>Lye,</HI> yet it is as great a <HI>Sin</HI> as a <HI>Lye.</HI> But you must part with <HI>all Sin,</HI> if you would find the <HI>Mercy</HI> and have the <HI>Comfort</HI> of a <HI>Pe∣nitent.</HI> The Great GOD has over and over again required you to <HI>put away all Malice,</HI> and <HI>lay aside all Malice.</HI> Yea, the SON of GOD, the <HI>True witness, who delivereth Souls,</HI> has expresly told you, <HI>That if you do not Forgive, you shall not be forgiven.</HI> I hope, the <HI>Lords-Prayer</HI> is not forgotten with you. Our Lord has taught us to pray, <HI>Forgive us as we forgive.</HI> I hope, you <HI>pray</HI> according to that <HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fly. <HI>Yes, I do! —But for all that, I can∣not Forgive that Man. GOD Almighty Revenge me on him! — 'Tis a Vain thing — I won't dy with a Lye in my mouth,</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou talkest like a Madman! — I hope that you will take pains with your own Heart, and cry to God for the Help of His Grace, that you may be disposed, as you know you should be; and that I shall find you in a <HI>Better Frame,</HI> when I come again to Visit you.</P>
<P>I hope, I <HI>now</HI> find the rest of you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>P. Co. and Gr. <HI>We heartily forgive all the World; and wish well to every Man.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have Supplied you with several Books of PIETY, to assist you in your Preparation for the Death before you. I hope, you allow some Time to a Serious Perusal of them. One of them, is En∣tituled, <HI>The Converted Sinner</HI>; and was occasion'd, by the last Predecessors you had in the state and place you are now brought into.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="002779_0019_0FE5F5F94C0748E0"/>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fly. <HI>I read that Book before ever I was brought hither!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>—And yet, come <HI>hither</HI>! An Aggravation of the Crimes that have brought you <HI>hither</HI>!</P>
<P>—But, above all; You have the Holy BIBLE in your Hands. 'Tis the <HI>Word of Life.</HI> Oh! Read it, and Learn from it how to call upon the GOD, that speaks unto you in it. Particularly, Meditate on the <HI>Fifty first Psalm,</HI> and let that <HI>Psalm</HI> teach you how to <HI>pray</HI> under your <HI>Blood-guiltiness.</HI> But what∣ever <HI>Form of Prayer</HI> may be commended unto you, see that it be always the <HI>Prayer of the Soul,</HI> which you address to the Glorious GOD: The <HI>Prayer of a Soul,</HI> full of <HI>Agony,</HI> Mourning for your Sin, —<HI>Wo is unto me that I have Sinned,</HI> and Groaning to your SAVIOUR, O <HI>Wretched one that I am, Wilt thou Deliver me</HI>!</P>
<P>We will now <HI>pray</HI> with you and for you.—</P>

<HEAD>A Second Conference. July. 9.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>ACcording to your Desire, which I am al∣ways ready unto the best of my power to Gratify, I have used my humble Intercessions, with His Honour the Lieu. Governour, to grant you a Reprieve of Two or Three Days, that you may have Time to make more Thorough Work, in the <HI>Process of Repentance</HI> which is, <HI>The one Thing that is Needful for you.</HI> He is a Person every where known to be of an <HI>Excellent Spirit,</HI> and as he is one of unspotted <HI>Equity,</HI> so he is one of uncommon <HI>Cle∣mency.</HI> It afflicts him, that he cannot grant you such a <HI>Small Releef,</HI> but, as the <HI>Special Court</HI> by which the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> of your <HI>Death,</HI> were A∣greed, Voted, and accordingly Registred, is now dissolved, he apprehends it improper for him <HI>now,</HI> to alter any thing about it.</P>
<P>But in <HI>this very Thing,</HI> you may now see the Hand of an Holy and a Righteous GOD, obliging you in some Degree to say, <HI>As I have done so GOD has Requited me</HI>! The Men whom you Murdered, <HI>they</HI> begg'd, <HI>they</HI> pleaded, <HI>they</HI> with the <HI>Groans of a Dead∣ly wounded Man</HI> importun'd you, that you would Al∣low them a <HI>Little Time,</HI> and not hurry them out of the World. But, <HI>Unmerciful Creatures,</HI> You were Inexorable. — And now, you Petition for a <HI>Little Time</HI>; and so has the Glorious GOD ordered
<PB N="19" REF="002779_0021_0FE5F61FEBA61A50"/>
it, that it <HI>cannot</HI> be granted you. May <HI>this very Thing</HI> help to awaken the Sentiments of <HI>Repentance</HI> in you. Especially since the <HI>Long-suffering</HI> of GOD, has allow'd more than a <HI>Fortnights</HI> Time of <HI>Recol∣lection,</HI> to you that would not allow a <HI>Moments</HI> Time, to them whose <HI>Blood</HI> is crying to Him a∣gainst you.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Fly</HI>; I hope, you are come to a <HI>Better Frame,</HI> than what I lately left you in.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I am where I was.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it. What? Is not your Heart yet prevailed withal, to let the Leaven of <HI>Malice</HI> be purged out of it? Can't you <HI>dy,</HI> wishing <HI>well</HI> to every one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P><HI>'Tis a Vain Thing to dissemble. No; I can't. There are those, that I can't Forgive.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you <HI>must</HI>; and you must Resign your Heart up to your SAVIOUR, that by the Influ∣ences and Assistences of His <HI>Grace,</HI> you <HI>may.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But I can't. — And I won't go out of the World, with a ly in my mouth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Criminal and prodigious <HI>Nonsence</HI> are you guilty of! —And yet you'l <HI>go out of the World,</HI> with what is <HI>as Bad</HI> in your <HI>Heart</HI>; Even with <HI>Mur∣der</HI> there, You will <HI>go out of the World,</HI> in a plain <HI>Re∣bellion</HI> against a Command of GOD our SAVIOUR, the Glorious One, who is the <HI>Judge of the World</HI>; whose <HI>Judgment-Seat</HI> you must appear before.</P>
<P>Has not the Great GOD our SAVIOUR, Ex∣presly commanded you, <HI>To forgive,</HI> even the great∣est of Enemies and of Injuries; and set before you an admirable and most Imitable <HI>Example</HI> of doing so? Dare you to <HI>Dy,</HI> persisting in a plain and a known <HI>Disobedience</HI> to Him? Can you imagine, that
<PB N="20" REF="002779_0022_0FE5F620C2BE9748"/>
He will be the <HI>Author</HI> of an <HI>Eternal Salvation</HI> for you, if you flatly refuse to <HI>Obey</HI> Him? O Vain I∣magination! O Vile Imagination!</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I can't help it!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, you must get <HI>Help</HI> for it. Certainly, you pretend some Hope to be <HI>Forgiven</HI> by GOD. Have not you <HI>wrong'd</HI> the Great GOD of Heaven infinitely more, than it is possible for any <HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Worm</HI> upon Earth, to <HI>Wrong</HI> you?</P>

<P>Will you then hope to have <HI>Ten Thousand Talents</HI> frankly <HI>forgiven</HI> to <HI>you,</HI> &amp; not forgive the <HI>Far∣thing,</HI> which is the most of the <HI>wrong</HI> that can be done to you? Nay, The Man that you say, has done you the greatest <HI>Wrong,</HI> has in Reality done you, what would prove the greatest <HI>Kindness</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> that could be done you, if you would wise∣ly make a due Improvement of it. He has put a stop to a <HI>Course</HI> of <HI>Wickedness,</HI> in which you were a∣pace running on Headlong to <HI>Hell.</HI> He has brought you into the way of <HI>Repentance</HI> &amp; <HI>Salvation.</HI> You may Bless GOD forever, for what you call the <HI>Wrong</HI> that has been done you; and, if you be not a <HI>Mad∣man,</HI> you will do so.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I must be where I am. 'Tis in vain to say any more.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will say thus much more; and the Blood of your Soul would ly upon me, if I should not say it. If you go away in this obstinacy, you can∣not look for any other, but that <HI>He who made you

will not have Mercy on you, and He who formed you will shew you no Favour.</HI></P>
<P>I will pass from This, to another Matter, where∣in I hope to see some <HI>Relentings</HI> begun upon you. Your <HI>Murders,</HI> your Cruel and Bloody <HI>Murders</HI>!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I can't Charge myself, — I shan't own myself Guilty of any Murder, — Our Captain and his Mate used us Barbarously. We poor Men can't have Justice done us. There is nothing said to our Commanders, let them never so much abuse us, and use us like Dogs. But the poor Sailors</HI> —</P>

<P><HI>I never Struck, either of the Persons!</HI></P>

<P><HI>No, 'Twas to Save him from the strokes.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And hawle him out of the Cabin, and throw him overboard!</P>
<P>But who <HI>plotted</HI> the <HI>Revolution</HI> aboard the Ship? a Day or Two before! What was your <HI>Intention</HI> about the Captain and the Mate, when you should sieze them? Why did you carry <HI>Mitchel,</HI> with his Broad-Axe into the <HI>Cabin?</HI> Who threw the Cap∣tain and the Mate overboard?</P>
<P>If <HI>Mitchel</HI> was the only <HI>Murderer,</HI> why did you not sieze him, and reserve him for <HI>Justice?</HI> Were the <HI>Murders,</HI> any other than one Article, in the <HI>Complicated Plot</HI> of <HI>Piracy,</HI> which you were now up∣on? Every step that any one of you all, took in the <HI>Piracy</HI> you have been prosecuting, involved you all in the <HI>Murders,</HI> which the <HI>Piracy</HI> begun withal?</P>
<P>And, who was it that gave the Ghostly Advice to the Captain, how to make <HI>Sufficient Preparation</HI> for

<P><HI>I shan't own my self Guilty. False Oathes are ta∣ken against me!</HI></P>

<P>—<HI>Greenville</HI> Concurr'd unto what he said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miserable Man, You know the Word of GOD, <HI>That no Murderer has Eternal Life.</HI> And <HI>Murders</HI> cannot be <HI>pardoned,</HI> if they be not Confessed, Bewailed, and Repented of.</P>
<P>We can do no more, but with <HI>Tears</HI> [which, alas, you have not for yourself!] Lament the unaccoun∣table and unparallel'd <HI>Obduration</HI> that you are given up unto; and Beseech you to <HI>Consider your ways</HI>; and send up our Cries unto the GOD of all Grace, to bestow a <HI>New,</HI> and a <HI>Right,</HI> and a <HI>Soft Heart</HI> upon you.</P>
<P>I have done with you, any further than to ask your Attention unto the brief <HI>Instructions,</HI> which your <HI>Three Brethren</HI> here are now expecting of me.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Sons of Death</HI>; Be attentive to the <HI>Words of Life</HI>; and Hearken as for Eternity.</P>
<P>You are in most affecting Circumstances. If you Dy two or three Days hence, in ill Terms with Heaven, you will be doom'd and thrown into Mi∣series, inconceivably more grievous, than any things which you ever have in this World been vexed with∣al. Your <HI>Spirits</HI> will be continually tortured with the furious and rending Scourges of a <HI>Guilty Con∣science.</HI> An Infinite GOD will arm your <HI>Conscience</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="002779_0025_0FE5F6339958E440"/>
to make direful Reflections on your past Misbeha∣viours. You will fall into the Hands of <HI>Devils</HI>; you may guess a little, how <HI>they</HI> will handle you, by <HI>your</HI> way of handling one another. Your Filthy <HI>Bodies</HI> will after a long period be <HI>Raised,</HI> that in them you may <HI>receive according to what you have done in Them.</HI> How tremendous <HI>pains,</HI> will be then inflict∣ed on you! Yea, The <HI>Lord GOD Omnipotent</HI> will not only Banish you from all comfortable Enjoy∣ments, but with more immediate Impressions of His Wrath, make you the Everlasting Triumphs of His Vengeance, and shoot intolerable Coruscations of it into your Enlarged Minds, and keep all the An∣guish of a Tormenting Fire upon them. Verily, He will <HI>Punish</HI> like a GOD; And you will find a <HI>Strange Punishment reserved for the workers of Iniquity.</HI> Can you hear this, and not cry out; <HI>O Lord, My Flesh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments</HI>!</P>
<P>But then, if before you <HI>Dy,</HI> you do in the Me∣thods of a <HI>Repenting Faith</HI> get your <HI>Pardon Sealed,</HI> and your Souls taken into the Saving and Healing Hands of that <HI>Good One,</HI> whose Call now unto you, is, <HI>Look unto me, and be Saved:</HI> Your Expired <HI>Spirits,</HI> will be taken into the <HI>Paradise</HI> of GOD. And the REDEEMER will anon <HI>Raise</HI> you from the <HI>Dead,</HI> and make you partakers of the <HI>Spiritual Blessings in the Heavenly places.</HI> Tho' you have been the Com∣panions of <HI>Robbers,</HI> you shall then be the Compani∣ons of <HI>Angels</HI>; yea, you shall <HI>Inherit all things,</HI> and be <HI>Filled with all the Fulness of GOD.</HI> The Things to be done for you, are beyond what the <HI>Heart of Man can conceive.</HI></P>
<P>You are not strangers to what we read of a <HI>Me∣nasseh,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="002779_0026_0FE5F63479DA5550"/>
in his <HI>Chains,</HI> returning to GOD. Oh! may you do and fare like him!</P>
<P>One, who had been a very wicked Man, dying in this Country, after the standers-by took him to be <HI>Dead,</HI> revived so far, as to start up in his Bed, &amp; cry out, <HI>O! All Heaven rings with it; A Great and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Old Sinner, coming to Heaven</HI>! As wicked as you have been, [<HI>wicked overmuch,</HI> and now to <HI>Dy before your Time</HI> for being so!] yet before <HI>Tuesday</HI> night, <HI>Heaven, Heaven,</HI> will be filled with the <HI>High-praises</HI> of GOD, and there will be <HI>Joy among the Angels</HI> for your Arrival there!</P>
<P>And now,</P>
<P>First, <HI>Cole,</HI> Do you answer me distinctly; an∣swer me to such Tings as these.</P>
<P>[<HI>The Answers, being mostly but words of Compli∣ance, there will be no need of Reciting them, and Repe∣ting them.</HI>]</P>
<P>'Tis by coming into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD and of <HI>Grace,</HI> that you are to <HI>Lay hold on Eternal Life.</HI> Behold, the meaning of that <HI>Covenant,</HI> and the man∣ner of coming into it.</P>
<P>You must apprehend, That the Eternal SON of GOD, has in a <HI>Covenant</HI> with His Eternal FA∣THER, engaged, That He will bring His People to <HI>Blessedness</HI>; — bring them to all the <HI>Good,</HI> which a GOD of Infinite <HI>Goodness,</HI> has purposed for them. You are apprehensive of <HI>This.</HI> —</P>
<P>One Thing Engaged by our Lord-REDEE∣MER, is, To offer up a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> unto <HI>Divine Jus∣tice</HI> to make Atonement for them; and undergo the sad Things which are due to them for their Sins, that so they may be delivered from them. And therewithal, To Obey the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD, and so
<PB N="25" REF="002779_0027_0FE5F6354FCE7E58"/>
work out, and bring in a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> that shall be Reckoned Their's; for <HI>them</HI> to be dealt withal ac∣cording to it. This is already done; Is it not?</P>
<P>Now, Do you <HI>Consent,</HI> unto This; To be <HI>For∣given</HI> of GOD, on the account of the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> your SAVIOUR has presented for you?</P>
<P>Do you <HI>Consent</HI> unto This; To be <HI>Accepted</HI> with GOD, on the account of the <HI>Righteousness</HI> with which your SAVIOUR does furnish you? And, You have no other <HI>Hope!</HI> — no other <HI>Plea</HI>!</P>
<P>Well; But another Thing Engaged by our Lord-REDEEMER is, To make suitable Impressions on the <HI>Souls</HI> of His Chosen; To fill them with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD and their Neighbour; To <HI>Heal</HI> all that is amiss in them; To <HI>Quicken</HI> them for Liv∣ing to GOD; And <HI>work</HI> in them what is <HI>well plea∣sing in the sight of GOD</HI>; and Conform them to His <HI>Will</HI> in every thing; and render all <HI>Sin</HI> Odious to them; and incline them to every thing that is <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Good</HI>; and fit them for, and bring them to, the <HI>Heavenly world.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>you,</HI> This remains to be done. Do you <HI>con∣sent,</HI> That He'l do all this for you, and in you?—</P>
<P>Do you Resign yourself up to His Holy SPIRIT, that He may do so? —</P>
<P>Instead of saying, <HI>I will Fear GOD and Serve Him,</HI> do you say, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I desire, that by Thee Living in me, I may Fear GOD, and Serve Him</HI>!</P>
<P>So, you are willing, that your SAVIOUR <HI>fulfil in you and for you, all the Good pleasure of His Good∣ness</HI>!</P>
<P>If your <HI>Heart</HI> be in This, then you are in the <HI>Co∣venant</HI> of GOD!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002779_0028_0FE5F63B71C378B0"/>Now, <HI>Greenville,</HI> Do you distinctly answer me to such things as these. There are Two <HI>Adams.</HI> The <HI>First Adam,</HI> who has been our unhappy <HI>Father</HI>; and <HI>Second Adam</HI> who is our Almighty SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>The <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD, without which, you <HI>Perish Wonderfully</HI> and Eternally, lies in your Tran∣slation from the <HI>First Adam,</HI> to the <HI>Second Adam.</HI></P>
<P>You are sensible, That the <HI>First Adam,</HI> whom the Great GOD constituted the <HI>Head</HI> of His off∣spring, Sinn'd against his GOD, in eating the <HI>For∣bidden Fruit.</HI> —</P>
<P>An <HI>horrible Sin</HI> it was!</P>
<P>It is <HI>your</HI> Sin; <HI>You</HI> had your part in it. GOD justly reckons it yours! —</P>
<P>Your <HI>First Father</HI> ceasing to be what he should be, there is derived from him to you, a <HI>Base Nature.</HI> Your Nature is depraved. All your <HI>Faculties</HI> are enfeebled, and corrupted. You have now an <HI>evil Disposition</HI> in you. — prone to <HI>all Evil.</HI> — Full of <HI>Enmity to GOD.</HI> — poisoned by the <HI>Devil.</HI> — In his <HI>Image.</HI></P>
<P>You feel This. —</P>
<P>Under the Efficacy of this <HI>Evil Principle,</HI> you have trespassed against the Laws of GOD, in <HI>Ac∣tual Sins,</HI> — Many, — Heinous, — All of them inexcusable. —</P>
<P>They render you worthy of all the <HI>Sorrows</HI> you have met withal! — yea, worthy of all <HI>the great Plagues and of long Continuance,</HI> in another world.</P>
<P>All this while, you have been a <HI>Slave to Satan, — Serving diverse Lusts?</HI> — In Hourly Danger of being thrown where the <HI>Smoke of the Torment ascends forever and ever?</HI></P>
<P>You feel this, — own it, — Count your condition very miserable.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="002779_0029_0FE5F63D6E9F8FE8"/>You dare not continue in it. You tremble at the Thoughts of lying under the <HI>Curse</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>Then, Be astonished; And, Oh! <HI>Receive not the Grace of GOD in Vain.</HI></P>
<P>The Blessed JESUS is the <HI>Second Adam.</HI> And since He is GOD as well as <HI>Man,</HI> He is more Able to <HI>Relieve</HI> you, than the <HI>First Adam</HI> could be to Ru∣ine you.</P>
<P>You hear Him inviting of you, to come under the <HI>shadow of His wings.</HI></P>
<P>You are made willing to do so; — And be <HI>Found in Him:</HI> — And be <HI>Drawn by Him.</HI> — You can't come if He don't help you.</P>
<P>You are willing, That as the Sin of your <HI>First Father</HI> is imputed unto you, so that what your SA∣VIOUR has <HI>done</HI> and <HI>born</HI> for His People, should be yours: — Availeable for you! — And <HI>you</HI> be saved from the <HI>Curse,</HI> because <HI>He</HI> has been <HI>made a Curse</HI> for you.</P>
<P>You are also willing, That your SAVIOUR should make a <HI>New Creature</HI> of you; — Stamp <HI>His Image</HI> upon you, and make you to <HI>Hate</HI> what He hates, and <HI>Love</HI> what He loves, and bring you to be all that He would have you to be?</P>
<P>You commit your self into His Precious Hands, that it may be so?</P>
<P>— I leave you in those Hands; and ask you accompany the <HI>Prayers</HI> that we shall now proceed unto. —</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe Greatest <HI>Unhappiness</HI> imaginable! And yet such as the most of Men are overta∣ken withal. To prevent such an <HI>Unhap∣ness,</HI> as it would be the brightest <HI>Wisdom,</HI> that any Man alive can attain unto, so it should be the liveliest <HI>Care</HI> that every Man living shall have his Mind concern'd about. It is impossible to begin this Care <HI>too soon.</HI> It is impossible to pursue this Care <HI>too much.</HI> Except this be a Mans <HI>Chief Care,</HI> it is impossible to escape the formidable <HI>Un∣happiness.</HI> I have before me the most <HI>Important Sub∣ject</HI> in the World. We cannot <HI>Preach</HI> too <HI>frequently</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="002779_0031_0FE5F6402F8E5100"/>
or too <HI>fervently</HI> on the Subject. You cannot <HI>hear</HI> too <HI>Attentively.</HI> I bring you this Day, those <HI>Max∣ims of Wisdom,</HI> which will require the greatest <HI>At∣tention</HI> from you. We are a Congregation of <HI>Dy∣ing People.</HI> The Danger of our <HI>Dying without Wis∣dom,</HI> 'tis incident unto us; 'tis threatning of us; we cannot be too <HI>deeply</HI> affected with it. We <HI>live without Wisdom,</HI> if we are not very <HI>deeply</HI> affected with it!</P>
<P>A <HI>Comparison</HI> is instituted between <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Men</HI>; to prove, That if <HI>Angels</HI> must abase them∣selves before GOD, and lay aside all boasting pre∣tensions to <HI>perfection,</HI> much more must Men do so. The Children of <HI>Men</HI> on Earth are on many Ac∣counts <HI>inferiour</HI> to the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, in Heaven. The <HI>Inferiority</HI> is particularly conspicuous, in our <HI>Mortality.</HI> And indeed, we are not only <HI>Mortal</HI> Creatures, but our <HI>Death</HI> is attended with some ve∣ry Humbling Circumstances. First, when men <HI>Dy,</HI> they are stript of that <HI>Excellency</HI> which makes them valuable among the Living. Tho' men may <HI>Excel</HI> ne∣ver so much, in <HI>Strength</HI> or in <HI>Beauty,</HI> in <HI>Wealth</HI> or in <HI>Honour</HI>; in <HI>Learning</HI> or in <HI>Authority</HI>; They are carried <HI>Naked</HI> unto the Grave. <HI>Death,</HI> deprives them, disrobes them, of those things for which they were esteemed <HI>Excellent.</HI> Indeed there is one <HI>Excel∣lency,</HI> which if Men had it, would <HI>Abide</HI> with them, when they <HI>Dy,</HI> and would <HI>outlive</HI> their <HI>Death.</HI> True <HI>Wisdom</HI> would do so. But now, Secondly, Behold, how <HI>unhappy</HI> the most of Men are in this thing, <HI>They Dy without Wisdom.</HI> And this is that awful <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which I am to insist upon.</P>
<Q><PB N="30" REF="002779_0032_0FE5F643B39CFB70"/>Let Men be never so wise, they are to Dy; but the most of Men are so unhappy as to be found without Wisdom when they Dy.</Q>
<P>No <HI>Wisdom</HI> can deliver any Man from <HI>Death</HI>; But it is a fearful wretchedness attending the <HI>Death</HI> of many Men, that they come to it <HI>without Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The first Thing before us is, The <HI>Unhappiness</HI> of <HI>All Men</HI>; which yet unto some who have a part in a Great Saviour, in a great Measure ceases to be an <HI>Unhappiness.</HI> Whatever <HI>Wisdom</HI> there be in any Men, <HI>Death</HI> is the unavoidable Portion of <HI>all Men.</HI> There is no <HI>Wisdom</HI> that will keep off the Stroke of <HI>Death.</HI> So some take the meaning of this Clause. In the Original it runs, <HI>They Dy, and there is not Wisdom in them</HI>; that is, no <HI>Wisdom</HI> to send off the stroke of <HI>Death. Nulla est Sapientia qua mortem Effu∣giant.</HI> So 'tis carried by Interpreters. The <HI>wis∣dom</HI> of Men signifies no more to save them from Death, than if they had no <HI>Wisdom.</HI> The <HI>Wisdom</HI> of any Man will not give him any more priviledge, to Exempt him from <HI>Death,</HI> than the veriest Fool in the World. We read, Eccl. 2.16. <HI>How dyes the wise Man? even as the Fool.</HI> We read, Psal. 49.10. <HI>Wise Men dy, likewise the Fool and the Brutish perish.</HI> It was of old said, concerning a <HI>wise</HI> Man, <HI>Died Ab∣ner as a Fool dieth</HI>? In some Sense he did so <HI>Dy.</HI> The <HI>Wisest</HI> Man in any Court or Colledge upon Earth, is as liable to <HI>Death</HI> as the poorest Creature that comes within the statute of <HI>Idiocy.</HI> We read, Heb. 9.27. — <HI>'Tis appointed for Men once to Dy.</HI> The <HI>Common Law</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> is what every Man, must submit unto. The <HI>Law</HI> runs, <HI>All Titles, Dig∣nities,
<PB N="31" REF="002779_0033_0FE5F648531D72A8"/>
Preferments, Excellencies &amp;c. to the Contrary, in any wise notwithstanding.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Common Lot</HI> of Mankind; of wise <HI>Men,</HI> as well as others. They must be none but Egregious <HI>Fools,</HI> who can dream of any Exemption from this <HI>common Lot.</HI> Ah, <HI>Foo∣lish</HI> Wretch, and far gone in <HI>Folly; shall the Earth be forsaken for thee</HI>; or shalt thou be permitted never to <HI>forsake the Earth</HI>! And shall a Decree more Esta∣blished than a <HI>Rock,</HI> be <HI>removed of its place,</HI> that thou mayst always continue in <HI>thy place</HI>? No, we have the Summ of the Matter, and the Root of it. Rom. 5.12; <HI>Wherefore, as by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men, for that all have sinned.</HI></P>
<P>First. No <HI>Natural Wisdom</HI> will secure, or excuse any Man from <HI>dying</HI> like all other Men. We read, 1 King. 11.43. <HI>Solomon slept with his Fathers.</HI> Where is the <HI>Politician,</HI> that can <HI>Out-wit</HI> his <HI>Last Enemy,</HI> or by his <HI>Wit</HI> elude the Approaches of that <HI>Enemy?</HI> What <HI>Lawyer</HI> so Cunning as to <HI>Quash</HI> the <HI>Writ of Death? Academies</HI> are emptied of their Inhabitants, as well as <HI>Hospitals.</HI> There is one honourable Tribe of Men, whose Profession 'tis to <HI>prolong Life.</HI> But the <HI>Physicians</HI> cannot instruct us how always to <HI>pro∣rogue Death. None of them can by any means redeem his Brother,</HI> or find out an <HI>Elixir</HI> by which his Patient may <HI>Live for ever, and not see Corruption.</HI> They some∣times put by a <HI>Pass,</HI> which <HI>Death</HI> is making at us; but let them <HI>Fence</HI> never so Skilfully, anon <HI>Death</HI> gives a <HI>Home Thrust,</HI> and the Distrest <HI>Physicians</HI> look on with troubled and grieved Eyes, and own, <HI>We are now Physicians of no Value.</HI> They <HI>dye themselves</HI> likewise; and none sooner, than they that like <HI>Paracelsus,</HI> brag of their <HI>Immortalizing Medicines.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="002779_0034_0FE5F6498019D160"/>Secondly. No, nor will <HI>Religious Wisdom</HI> neither. We read, Josh. 1.2. <HI>Moses my Servant is Dead.</HI> They that are <HI>wise unto Salvation,</HI> yet will not by that <HI>Wisdom Save</HI> themselves from <HI>Temporal Death. Piety</HI> will deliver from the <HI>Sting</HI> of <HI>Death</HI>; but not from <HI>Death</HI> it self. <HI>Piety</HI> will deliver from the <HI>second Death</HI>; but not from the <HI>First Death. Piety</HI> will ob∣tain a <HI>Resurrection</HI> for us, that will bring us out of the <HI>Grave</HI>; it will not obtain a <HI>Preservation</HI> for us, that we shall not go into the <HI>Grave. What Man is he that liveth,</HI> let him live never so piously, never so prayerfully, never so Fruitfully, who <HI>shall not see Death, or deliver his Soul from the hand of the Grave?</HI> In fine, It was a Sentence in the Wisdom of the Ancients; <HI>Is Vir non est, qui lapides atque edificia cor∣ruere, et homines mori miratur.</HI> The Man that won∣ders to see <HI>Buildings fall,</HI> and <HI>People dy,</HI> is not worthy the Name of a <HI>Man.</HI> I remember <HI>Posidonius</HI> in the Life of <HI>Austin,</HI> tells us, how much that Great Man was affected with that Sentence, a little before his own going out of the World. May we <HI>all,</HI> since we are all going out of the world, accustom our∣selves to this Heart affecting <HI>Meditation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The second Thing before us, is, A much <HI>worse unhpppiness</HI> that befalls the <HI>most of men,</HI> and the <HI>worst unhappiness</HI> that any Man can have befalling of him. The most of Men, <HI>dy</HI> before they have arri∣ved unto the only true <HI>Wisdom.</HI> Few Men are <HI>wise</HI> before they <HI>Dy.</HI> Thus this clause is well carri∣ed by Expositors; <HI>Prius moriuntur quam quicquam intellexerunt de Divina Sapientia.</HI> They <HI>Dy</HI> before they know what <HI>Wisdom</HI> is: They <HI>dy</HI> strangers, to Divine, Real, Saving <HI>Wisdom.</HI> All Men are, <HI>born
<PB N="33" REF="002779_0035_0FE5F64A50D599D0"/>
Fools.</HI> We read, Job 11.12. <HI>Born like the wild-Asses Colt.</HI> And the most of Men <HI>Dy Fools.</HI> The <HI>lives</HI> of Men are generally spent in <HI>Folly.</HI> And they <HI>dy</HI> before the cure of their <HI>Folly.</HI></P>
<P>We will Enquire; First, <HI>Whence it proceeds,</HI> that the most of Men, <HI>dy</HI> before they arrive unto <HI>Wis∣dom?</HI> You may be sure, The <HI>Fall of Man</HI> is the cause of this evil. Man was ambitious of <HI>Wisdom.</HI> The Temptation of the <HI>Forbidden Fruit</HI> was, <HI>A Tree to be desired, to make one wise.</HI> But Man by his <HI>Fall</HI> has lost his <HI>Wisdom.</HI> A <HI>Darkness</HI> is come upon his Mind. His perverse Mind is now naturally dispos∣ed unto <HI>Error.</HI> He is naturally <HI>Ignorant, and out of the way.</HI> His Faculties, to discern <HI>wisely</HI> what is <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> are horribly wounded by his <HI>Fall</HI> from God. It is now come to pass, that the Children of Men come under that Character; Rom. 3.16.17. —<HI>The way of Peace they have not know.</HI> And because the depraved Soul of Man <HI>loves</HI> his <HI>Error,</HI> therefore the Holy God <HI>leaves</HI> him in it. Because he will not be reclaimed from it, God lets him go on in his <HI>Error.</HI> Because he <HI>hates the Light,</HI> God witholds it from him. He Delights in his <HI>Darkness,</HI> &amp; prefers and practises the <HI>Works of Darkness</HI>; God therefore gives him up to his <HI>Darkness.</HI> We may add, what we read; 2. Cor. 4.4. <HI>The god of this world blinded their Minds. Satan</HI> is by the wrath of God, become the <HI>Ruler of this Dark World.</HI> Men do by Sin put themselves under the Dominion of <HI>Satan. Satan</HI> shuts his poor Slaves up in those <HI>Dungeons,</HI> where the Rayes of <HI>Wisdom</HI> do not reach them. Sin∣ners enslaved by <HI>Satan,</HI> may say of their Master, <HI>He has laid me in the lowest Pitt, in Darkness, in the Deeps.</HI> They are by the Intrigues of <HI>Satan,</HI> kept so
<PB N="34" REF="002779_0036_0FE5F64FE3F21660"/>
full of <HI>Business,</HI> and carried unto such a <HI>Distance</HI> from God, that they can't see things in a <HI>True light.</HI> So they go down to the <HI>Generation</HI> of their Foolish <HI>Fathers,</HI> and <HI>they never see light.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. We will Enquire, <HI>How it appears,</HI> that the most of Men <HI>Dy</HI> before they arrive unto <HI>Wis∣dom.</HI> There needs no stronger, nor no sadder proof of this, than what we have in the Daily <HI>Com∣plaints</HI> of <HI>Dying Men.</HI> Some <HI>Dy</HI> with very little sense of what has been amiss in their Lives. <HI>Mad∣ness</HI> has been in their <HI>Hearts while they have lived,</HI> &amp; with that <HI>Madness</HI> they have <HI>gone to the Dead.</HI> But, of them who are not perfect <HI>Sotts</HI> and <HI>Stones</HI> in their <HI>Death,</HI> the most by far, <HI>dy</HI> confessing and complain∣ing, that they have been without <HI>Wisdom</HI> all their Dayes. They own, they have never come unto <HI>Wisdom,</HI> until their <HI>Dying Hour</HI> be come upon them. And it is well, if <HI>now</HI> they do any more, than see that they have been without <HI>Wisdom</HI>; it is well if <HI>now</HI> they come really to get any of that <HI>Wisdom,</HI> which they have been thus long without. We read, Prov. 5.11, 12. of, <HI>Mourning at the last, How have I hated Instruction!</HI> The most of Men go on fool∣ishly all their days, in such Indiscretions, that they <HI>mourn at the last</HI>;
<Q>Oh! If <HI>I were to live over again,</HI> I would never lead my Life so <HI>foolishly</HI> as I have done! I would order my <HI>Life</HI> after another and a wiser Manner than I have done!</Q>
When that fa∣mous Roman <HI>Cicero,</HI> was come towards the latter End of his <HI>Life,</HI> he cried out, <HI>O me nunquam pru∣densem!</HI> 'Alas, I have never done the part of a <HI>'Wise Man,</HI> in all my Days. Thus do the most of Men cry out of themselves, at a <HI>latter End</HI> full of <HI>Bitterness. Dying</HI> Men say; <HI>We have lived without
<PB N="35" REF="002779_0037_0FE5F65445F45678"/>
Wisdom.</HI> At their <HI>Death</HI> 'tis found and own'd, they have been without it. In a <HI>Dying</HI> Hour to be for∣ced unto the Confession, <HI>I have until now been whol∣ly destitute of Wisdom!</HI> And now, no opportunity to <HI>Exert</HI> it, or, perhaps to <HI>obtain</HI> it! —</P>
<P>We will Enquire, Thirdly. <HI>Who they are,</HI> which <HI>Dy</HI> before they arrive unto <HI>Wisdom.</HI> You shall shall have a brief Description of them.</P>
<P>First, They who <HI>Dy Unprepared for Death,</HI> such <HI>Dy without Wisdom.</HI> The truest <HI>Wisdom</HI> of Man, lies, of old they said, <HI>In a Meditation of Death</HI>; I will say, <HI>In a Preparation for death. Death</HI> finds none but Egregious <HI>Fools Unprepared</HI> for it. We are warned, That before we <HI>dy,</HI> we must be <HI>prepared</HI> for it, by a <HI>Sanctifying Change</HI> upon us; <HI>Prepared</HI> for it, by be∣ing <HI>Renewed in the Spirit of our Minds: Prepared</HI> for it, by turning to God, and Closing with Christ, &amp; having the Dispositions which will render us <HI>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in light.</HI> We are warned, That if we <HI>dy</HI> before we are thus <HI>Prepared</HI> for it, it will be <HI>Good for us, that we had never been born.</HI> Our <HI>Death</HI> will be but a sort of a <HI>Trap door,</HI> by which we shall be thrown down into the place of <HI>Dragons,</HI> a place of <HI>Torments.</HI> It can be no <HI>Wisdom</HI> to slight this warning, and neglect this <HI>Preparation</HI> for Death. Unto one <HI>Unprepared for death,</HI> it was said; Luk. 12.20. <HI>Thou Fool!</HI> Oh! how justly, how justly may it be said unto such an one; <HI>Ah, Fool, dying without Wisdom!</HI> The <HI>unprepared</HI> Soul, tumbles into a dreadful Eternity, with such a shriek as that;
<Q>What a <HI>Fool,</HI> Oh! what a <HI>Fool,</HI> have I been! What horrible <HI>Stripes</HI> has my <HI>Folly</HI> brought me to!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="002779_0038_0FE5F65591FD6C48"/>Secondly. They who <HI>dy, before they have begun to live,</HI> shall <HI>dy without Wisdom.</HI> A Man does not <HI>be∣gin to live,</HI> until he <HI>lives unto God.</HI> He that never begins to mind the Great <HI>Errand,</HI> which GOD sent him into the World upon, has not <HI>begun to live.</HI> He that fills not his Life with <HI>Acknowledgements</HI> of GOD, and studies not to <HI>Acknowledge God in all his ways,</HI> has not <HI>begun to live.</HI> He that lives wholly <HI>to himself,</HI> and sweels away his Life, only in the <HI>Hurries,</HI> and the <HI>Pleasures,</HI> and <HI>Amusements</HI> of <HI>this Life</HI>; may have it said of him, as, 1 Tim. 5.6. <HI>He is dead, while he lives.</HI> 'Tis not <HI>Wisdom</HI>; No, 'Tis <HI>Folly in its Exaltation,</HI> to live at this rate. If <HI>Death</HI> overtakes a Man, while he is yet <HI>alienated from the Life of God</HI>; If <HI>Death</HI> siezes upon a Man, be∣fore he is experimentally acquainted with the Me∣thods of a <HI>Godly Life:</HI> the Man <HI>dies without Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. They who <HI>dy in their Sins,</HI> these <HI>dy with∣out Wisdom. Sin</HI> is <HI>Folly.</HI> Every Sinner is a <HI>Fool.</HI> In sinning we bring our selves into cause for saying, as, 2 Sam. 24.10. <HI>I have sinned, and I have done very foolishly.</HI> Men are not come to <HI>Wisdom,</HI> till they have left off <HI>sinning,</HI> or, while they go on still in their <HI>Trespasses.</HI> If Men <HI>dy</HI> before they are <HI>Con∣verted from the Error of their ways,</HI> they <HI>dy without Wisdom.</HI> To <HI>dy Unpardoned,</HI> is to <HI>dy Miserable.</HI> To <HI>dy</HI> with Sin unbewailed, and unforsaken, and unre∣pented of, is to <HI>dy Unpardoned.</HI> So to <HI>dy</HI> — with <HI>Folly</HI> not abandoned, nor forgiven; To <HI>dy,</HI> with <HI>the Wrath of God yet abiding</HI> on the Soul; To <HI>dy,</HI> and carry away a <HI>Guilty Conscience,</HI> which will gnaw, and scourge, and vex the Soul, and be within it, a <HI>Worm that will never dy</HI>! Certainly, tis no <HI>Wisdom</HI> to <HI>dy</HI> so!</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>But my Discourse must pass into a most Impor∣tunate <HI>Exhortation.</HI> And it is an Exhortation, to be managed with the most Vehement <HI>Importunity,</HI> be∣cause we are every one of us very nearly concern∣ed in it. If any one of us could promise himself to be excused from <HI>dying</HI> at all; Yea, or if any one of us could promise himself to <HI>live</HI> so much as <HI>One Day</HI> longer, the <HI>Exhortation</HI> might suffer some A∣batement of the Flame in which it must come un∣to us. Oh! But not one of us can promise any such matter. We are all concerned. My Address must be as extensive as that; Psal. 49.1. <HI>Hear this, all ye People.</HI> This must be the <HI>Exhortation</HI> to us all. <HI>Immediately, Immediately</HI> become so <HI>wise,</HI> as to get beyond the Danger of <HI>dying without Wisdom.</HI> If you enquire, and methinks you should be Inquisi∣tive, <HI>What is that Wisdom?</HI> GOD Himself shall give you an Answer, Job 28.28. <HI>And unto Man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is Wisdom, and to de∣part from evil, that is Understanding.</HI> Syrs, be assured of this. A Man may have the <HI>Wisdom</HI> to <HI>Govern</HI> and <HI>Manage</HI> whole Nations of Men; but if he <HI>dy</HI> without any better <HI>Wisdom, How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, Son of the Morning,</HI> who didst or∣der the Nations? A Man may have the <HI>Wisdom</HI> to understand as many <HI>Languages</HI> as a <HI>Mithridates</HI>; but if he <HI>dy</HI> without better <HI>Wisdom,</HI> he must be lodg'd where he shall gnaw his Tongue for Pain, &amp; know no <HI>Language</HI> but that of Roaring and of Blasphemy. A Man may have the <HI>Wisdom</HI> to Calculate all the Motions of the <HI>Heavens</HI>; but if he <HI>dy</HI> without bet∣ter
<PB N="38" REF="002779_0040_0FE5F65BFA01CAE0"/>
<HI>Wisdom,</HI> he must go down to <HI>Hell,</HI> and lie in restless <HI>Chains of Darkness</HI> there. An acute Philoso∣pher, will not by all his Wisdom, avoid a worse Fate than that of an <HI>Empedocles.</HI></P>
<P>The greatest Case that ever can be spoken to, is now to be briefly spoken to. <HI>What shall a Person do, that he may be rescued and preserved from the Un∣happiness of dying without Wisdom?</HI> O my dying Friends; Hearken, Hearken to the Counsils of GOD; the Dictates and the Lessons of the truest <HI>Wisdom</HI>!</P>
<P>First. You must <HI>Repent of all your Folly</HI> before you <HI>dy</HI>; Else you will <HI>dy without Wisdom.</HI> To <HI>Sin</HI> is to <HI>play the Fool.</HI> To go on in Sin, is to go astray in the <HI>Greatness of our Folly.</HI> To walk in the way of Sin, is to <HI>wander from the way of Understanding. Re∣pentance</HI> is a <HI>Resipiscence</HI>; 'tis a <HI>growing wise again.</HI> In <HI>Repentance</HI> a Man does that thing; Luk. 15.17. <HI>come to himself.</HI> The Sinners <HI>dy without Wisdom</HI> surely, who go out of the world before they <HI>come to themselves.</HI> Ah, <HI>Dying People</HI>; This, This you have to do before you <HI>dy.</HI> You must <HI>Lament</HI> be∣fore the Lord, the Miscarriages which your Lives have been fill'd withal; the Violations of His Holy and Just and Good Laws, in the Course of your Lives; Esteem it a most <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing, that you have <HI>offended</HI> Him: You must lay to heart that <HI>fountain</HI> of all wickedness every one of us has in his own desperately wicked Heart; that <HI>evil Heart of unbelief, which inclines us to depart from the living God.</HI> You must apprehend <HI>Sin</HI> as the <HI>worst evil</HI>; be apprehensive of an hideous and horrid e∣vil enwrapped in it; especially, as it is a <HI>Denial of the God that is Above.</HI> You must loath and Judge
<PB N="39" REF="002779_0041_0FE5F65D878C5B98"/>
yourselves, as worthy of a terrible <HI>Destruction from God,</HI> for the offence that your Sin has given to His Infinite Majesty. You must Believe that He is a <HI>God ready to Pardon.</HI> Believe the <HI>offer</HI> which He makes of His <HI>Pardoning Mercy</HI> unto the <HI>Chief of Sin∣ners.</HI> Believe the <HI>purchase</HI> which the Blood of your Saviour has made of a <HI>Pardon,</HI> for all that will em∣brace the <HI>offer.</HI> You must <HI>Accept</HI> this astonishing <HI>Offer.</HI> But Accept it, with a sincere <HI>Desire,</HI> a steady <HI>Purpose</HI> to <HI>Transgress no more.</HI> Sincerely and stedily say, <HI>I will not offend any more.</HI> And if you have <HI>wrong'd</HI> your <HI>Neighbour,</HI> you must endeavour all suitable <HI>Reparation</HI> and <HI>Restitution.</HI> You <HI>dy without Wisdom,</HI> if you dy without such a <HI>Repentance.</HI> Oh! Let it not after this be said, as, Jer. 8.6. <HI>No Man Repented him.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. You must make sure of an Interest in a Glorious CHRIST, before you <HI>dy</HI>; else you will <HI>dy without Wisdom.</HI> You are sensible, That our Great Redeemer, is for many and weighty Causes in the Sacred Scriptures, called by the Name of, <HI>Wisdom.</HI> We read, 1 Cor. 1.30. <HI>He is of GOD, made unto us, Wisdom.</HI> Then to dy <HI>without Christ,</HI> is to <HI>dy without Wisdom.</HI> Wherefore, This you have to do before you <HI>dy.</HI> You must come to an <HI>Ac∣quaintance,</HI> and an <HI>Union,</HI> with your only Saviour. You must consent unto that <HI>Covenant,</HI> which your Saviour, as the Head of His People, has made with His Eternal <HI>Father</HI>; and be willing that He should not only make <HI>Expiation</HI> for your Sins, but also Quicken you and Assist you to <HI>Live</HI> unto Him. You must Receive your Saviour in all His <HI>Offices,</HI> and with all His <HI>Benefits,</HI> and have a Soul ravish∣ed with His <HI>Excellencies</HI>; and <HI>commit</HI> your all into
<PB N="40" REF="002779_0042_0FE5F65F132394F8"/>
His Hands, and <HI>Rely</HI> upon Him for all the Blessings of Goodness. Oh! Let no one dare to <HI>dy,</HI> till he has done this. To <HI>dy Christless</HI> is to <HI>dy without Wis∣dom,</HI> and <HI>without Hope</HI> of Blessedness! <HI>Faith</HI> is in the New Testament ever now and then called, <HI>Wisdom.</HI> If you <HI>dy,</HI> before you have <HI>obtained a pre∣cious Faith</HI> in the only Saviour, you <HI>dy without Wis∣dom,</HI> and the <HI>Gospel</HI> being <HI>hid</HI> from you, you are <HI>Lost, Lost</HI> for ever. If a <HI>Christ</HI> be not your <HI>Portion,</HI> you have your <HI>Portion with Unbelievers</HI>; A Portion from which, <HI>O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my Soul</HI>!</P>
<P>Thirdly. You must have your Minds rectified with a <HI>Principle of Grace,</HI> before you <HI>dy</HI>; else you will <HI>dy without Wisdom.</HI> That <HI>Principle of Grace,</HI> which purifies the Soul of a Sinner from his Evil Tendencies, and makes a New Creature of him, is most reasonably called, <HI>Wisdom.</HI> Thus we read; Psal. 51.6. Of <HI>Wisdom in the Hidden Part.</HI> A <HI>Princi∣ple of Grace,</HI> will cause a Man to act <HI>wisely.</HI> To <HI>fear</HI> GOD, and <HI>prize</HI> His Christ, and <HI>hate</HI> all Sin, and <HI>sleight</HI> this World, and <HI>bear</HI> Afflictions patiently and fruitfully, and be a <HI>good Steward</HI> of the manifold Favours of GOD, and be a <HI>Blessing</HI> in all Relations, and keep joyfully looking for the <HI>Mercy</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ in an <HI>Everlasting Life</HI>: This is to act <HI>wisely.</HI> A <HI>Principle of Grace</HI> will produce this <HI>wise Behaviour.</HI> A Soul dismiss'd by <HI>Death,</HI> being found under the power of such a <HI>Principle,</HI> will be found <HI>mark'd</HI> for the Heavenly World. It has the <HI>Marks of the Lord</HI> upon it. A Soul then found without such a <HI>Principle,</HI> will be found without any Claim to the Blessings of the <HI>Heavenly Places.</HI> It will be claim'd by the <HI>Destroyer</HI>; and it can have nothing but a <HI>fearful Expectation of a fiery Indignation.</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="002779_0043_0FE5F65FE5396F28"/>
My Neighbours, Before you <HI>dy,</HI> you must with a <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD, have a <HI>Principle of Grace</HI> wrought in your Souls. And therefore, you must <HI>Cry to the God of all Grace,</HI> and <HI>wait</HI> on Him for it, with a most unspeakable Agony. You must <HI>Resign</HI> your selves unto the <HI>Spirit of Grace,</HI> and sollicit, and en∣tertain His <HI>Influences,</HI> and submit to, and fall in with, His <HI>Operations.</HI> Keep doing so, while you <HI>Live</HI>; Keep doing it, as for your <HI>Lives.</HI> Tremble, Trem∣ble at the Thought of <HI>dying,</HI> till you have in you, the <HI>Spring of Everlasting Life</HI>!</P>
<P>Fourthly. You must <HI>wisely Measure,</HI> and <HI>wisely Employ,</HI> the <HI>Time of your Lives</HI>; otherwise you will be without <HI>Wisdom,</HI> at the <HI>End of your Lives.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Wisdom</HI> to <HI>Measure</HI> our Time well. Thus we read; Psal. 90.12. <HI>So teach us to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts unto Wisdom.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Wisdom,</HI> not to allot upon more <HI>Days</HI> than we have Reason for. 'Tis <HI>Wisdom</HI> to allow, that for ought we know, we are entred into the very <HI>last</HI> of our <HI>Days.</HI> Again, 'Tis <HI>Wisdom</HI> to Employ our <HI>Time</HI> well. Thus we read; Eph. 5.15, 16. <HI>See then that ye walk circum∣spectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the Time, be∣cause the Days are evil.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Wisdom</HI> to spend our Hours, in such a manner that we may give a <HI>good Account</HI> how we have spent them. 'Tis <HI>Wisdom</HI> not to throw away our <HI>Hours</HI> impertinently, but be al∣ways either <HI>doing</HI> or <HI>getting</HI> of Good in them all. Mind it then, Syrs. You will <HI>dy without Wisdom,</HI> if your <HI>Death</HI> surprize you; if your <HI>Death</HI> come un∣expectedly;— if at your <HI>Death</HI> you must say; <HI>I never look'd for this! I did not imagine that I could be so near to this.</HI> You will <HI>dy without Wisdom,</HI> if your <HI>Death</HI> come upon you, before you have learnt the
<PB N="42" REF="002779_0044_0FE5F66A6A584D30"/>
Skill of <HI>Living Usefully</HI>; if your <HI>Death</HI> cut you down, before you are grown <HI>Fruitful in good Works</HI>; and bring forth much <HI>Fruit unto God.</HI> Oh! Beware of this.</P>
<P>Fifthly. To Escape the <HI>Finished Folly of Dying without Wisdom,</HI> one way is, To <HI>Learn Wisdom from the Dying.</HI> Verily, <HI>The Thoughts of a Dying Man,</HI> are those wherein Ordinarily you hear <HI>Wisdom Justifi∣ed,</HI> even by those who never in all their Days be∣fore have been the <HI>Children</HI> of it. The <HI>Wisdom</HI> which the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Exalted Folly</HI> have derided, while they thought of nothing but living always here, is, in <HI>The Thoughts of a Dying Man,</HI> how Ap∣proved, how Applauded, how Recommended unto the Survivers! When Men see the <HI>Days of the life of their Vanity</HI> come to their period, they Recom∣mend unto the World, the <HI>Religion</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR, and a Conformity to the <HI>Maxims</HI> of it, as the only <HI>Wisdom</HI> in the World! Ask a Dying Man, <HI>What is the Wisest Course that can be taken?</HI> He will say;
<Q>Oh! <HI>live</HI> to GOD, and <HI>live</HI> by the <HI>Faith</HI> of the SON of GOD, as soon and as much as ever you can; And fill your <HI>life</HI> with Acts of <HI>Devotion</HI> towards GOD, and with Acts of <HI>Benigni∣ty</HI> towards Man; And let the <HI>Views</HI> of a <HI>life to come</HI> govern you <HI>in all Manner of Conversation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Such Things you have a thousand and a thou∣sand times heard from the Quivering <HI>Lips,</HI> that have had an Immortal Soul just Expiring from them. Won't you <HI>hearken to the Voice</HI> of such <HI>Teachers,</HI> but <HI>Mourn at the last,</HI> for your Obstinacy and Impeni∣tence? <HI>O ye Fools, when will you be wise!</HI> —</P>
<P>And now, The Great GOD has ordered it, that a Number of <HI>Dying Men</HI> appear among us, in
<PB N="43" REF="002779_0045_0FE5F66CCA8636C0"/>
some Tragical and peculiar Circumstances. Ano∣ther Company of PIRATES under <HI>Sentence of Death</HI> appear among us, and are within a few Hours to be Executed.</P>
<P>Certainly, It will be the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of us all, but e∣specially of our <HI>Sea-faring Tribe,</HI> to learn from these <HI>Dying Men,</HI> some things which the <HI>living</HI> that <HI>see the End</HI> of these Men must <HI>lay to Heart,</HI> — if they would not with an <HI>Hard Heart</HI> lay up for them∣selves <HI>Treasures of Wrath,</HI> to be poured out upon them, in the <HI>Righteous Judgment</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>Learn from these poor Men, the Mischief of those <HI>Two Vices,</HI> wherein so many of the <HI>Sea-faring Tribe</HI> suffer the doleful <HI>Shipwreck</HI> of their Souls, and are <HI>drowned in Perdition.</HI> The first, that of <HI>Drunken∣ness</HI>; And then, that of profane <HI>Swearing</HI> and <HI>Cur∣sing.</HI> These poor Men do, with unutterable An∣guish cry out, under the heavy Load of <HI>Guilt,</HI> which these Two Vices have laid and left upon them. The former Vice, <HI>resigns</HI> the Sinner up to the <HI>Possession</HI> of the <HI>Devil</HI>; and by Consequence, to all manner of Wickedness. The latter Vice, <HI>de∣clares</HI> that the <HI>Devil</HI> has taken an horrible <HI>Possession</HI> of the Sinner, and the Wretch cannot now so truly say, what he use to do, <HI>My Tongue is my own</HI>; as he may say, <HI>'Tis the Devils</HI>: And being <HI>Set on Fire of Hell,</HI> 'tis plain, what and where a <HI>Torment</HI> is intend∣ed for it. Being thus <HI>Warned</HI> of them, Oh! <HI>Steer clear</HI> of the <HI>Rocks,</HI> where you see the <HI>Breakers</HI> before you!</P>
<P>At the same time, when, Oh! when, will the <HI>Sea</HI> no longer have cause to say of <HI>Wisdom, It is not in me</HI>! And complain that they who follow the <HI>Sea,</HI> will so <HI>Madly</HI> as they do, abandon themselves,
<PB N="44" REF="002779_0046_0FE5F66DF390D228"/>
and let their Souls <HI>drive</HI> to the Courses of <HI>Self-de∣struction</HI>! Poor Sailours, Will you never hearken to the <HI>Voice of Wisdom?</HI> Always be <HI>Madmen,</HI> and with <HI>Madness in your Hearts go to the Dead?</HI> Never become a Pious, a Sober, a Serious, and a Prudent Generation? Let the Condition of these Poor Men help you to <HI>receive Instruction</HI> and <HI>acquaint your Hearts with Wisdom.</HI> In their Condition you see, that if you <HI>go on still in your Trespasses</HI> a Provoked GOD can by the Hands of <HI>Sea-Monsters,</HI> which thro' His <HI>Curse</HI> upon you do <HI>Increase and Multiply,</HI> &amp; become the <HI>Terror of them that haunt the Sea,</HI> bring sore plagues upon you: And even one of these <HI>Le∣viathans</HI> have a permission to pillage no less than Four Hundred Vessels of you. Yea, and what is infinitely worse; In <HI>their</HI> Condition you see what <HI>you</HI> may be left unto: And how far, if you remain Incorrigible in your evil ways, the Justice of GOD may give you up to the <HI>Lusts of your own Hearts,</HI> and leave you to do those things, which may bring a <HI>fearful End</HI> upon you, that once you little imagined. <HI>Oh! What may you come to!</HI></P>
<P>My Friends; <HI>Be Admonished by these things</HI>; And, <HI>Be wise.</HI></P>
<P>But while I am addressing the poor <HI>Sailours,</HI> and beseeching them, that they would not let the <HI>Devil,</HI> who is the worst of <HI>Masters,</HI> enslave them, nor have their <HI>Names</HI> in the <HI>Book</HI> of, <HI>The Wicked one,</HI> I would presume upon an Address to the <HI>Masters</HI> of our Vessels, that they would not be too like the <HI>Devil,</HI> in their <HI>Barbarous Usage</HI> of the <HI>Men</HI> that are under them, and lay them under <HI>Temptations</HI> to do <HI>Despe∣rate Things.</HI> We allow, Syrs, That you must be <HI>Commanders</HI> aboard, and you must keep a <HI>strict Hand</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="002779_0047_0FE5F66ECB35F6F0"/>
over your Men; and you may, <HI>as Times go,</HI> too of∣ten have occasions for <HI>Severities</HI>; But still, there must be no room for <HI>Barbarities.</HI> Our best <HI>Com∣manders</HI> find they can do without such Things. The <HI>Men</HI> must be used as <HI>Rational Creatures.</HI> Yea, <HI>Mas∣ters,</HI> you must Remember your MEN, — Don't you call 'em so? — They are your <HI>Brethren.</HI> And you would certainly find it so, that with a <HI>Merciful Usage</HI> of your <HI>Men,</HI> if you wisely maintain the <HI>Ex∣ercises</HI> of PIETY aboard your Vessels, and be your∣selves bright <HI>Examples</HI> of it, your GOD, and the <HI>Conscience</HI> that speaks from and for Him in your <HI>Men,</HI> would be on <HI>your side,</HI> and your <HI>Authority</HI> would be sufficiently Established.</P>
<P>I Conclude. And, <HI>Hear this, O all ye People, eve∣ry one of you</HI>! You cannot be secured from the In∣expressible, the Incomprehensible <HI>Infelicity</HI> of, <HI>Dy∣ing without Wisdom,</HI> if you do not immediately come into a fixed RESOLUTION, for that which is, <HI>The Beginning of Wisdom: Resolved</HI> for the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> and a <HI>Life of Religion.</HI> Oh! Be not so <HI>Exceeding Mad,</HI> any of you, as to remain <HI>Unresolved,</HI> whe∣ther the Glorious GOD be not worthy of a per∣petual Homage from you; whether a Gracious RE∣DEEMER have not such Things to do for you, as are worth your looking to Him for; whether the <HI>Spiritual Blessings in Heavenly places,</HI> are not rather to be chosen, than a <HI>Devouring Fire, and Everlasting Burnings!</HI> Will our <HI>young People,</HI> be so <HI>wise</HI> now, as to <HI>Consider their Latter End</HI>! We read of such a Thing as that; Prov. 1.4. <HI>Giving to the young Man Discretion.</HI> The word for, <HI>Discretion,</HI> there, may be rendred, <HI>Thoughtfulness.</HI> Oh! That our <HI>young Peo∣ple</HI> would be so <HI>Discrete</HI> as to be more <HI>Thoughtful</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="002779_0048_0FE5F678B0DCDD88"/>
than they often are! Oh! that they might be able to say, <HI>I thought on my ways, and I turned my Feet unto the ways, whereto GOD has born His Testimonies.</HI> And, Children, I now more particularly Demand your <HI>Thoughts</HI> on two <HI>Questions,</HI> in the <HI>Catechism for Conscience,</HI> which continually comes upon you.</P>
<P>I demand it of you, whether you are sure of a∣ny more <HI>Time</HI> to get <HI>Wisdom,</HI> than <HI>this very Moment,</HI> before you <HI>dy?</HI> GOD has taught you an Answer to this Question; Prov. 7.5. <HI>Boast not thy self of To¦morrow; for thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</HI></P>
<P>I demand it of you, whether if you <HI>dy without Wisdom,</HI> your <HI>Folly</HI> will not be inexcusable, your <HI>Horror</HI> intolerable, your <HI>Torture</HI> insupportable? God has taught you an Answer to this Question; Heb. 10.31. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I hope 'tis no longer a matter of Suspense with you; But you are come to a point, <HI>Great God, Thro' thy CHRIST I desire to live unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>The short SERMON occasion'd by the Conditi∣on of these Miserables, is thus finished. What remains, is,</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<PB N="47" REF="002779_0049_0FE5F6798FAF7CD8"/>
<HEAD>The EXECUTION.</HEAD>
<P>AND now, <HI>speedily,</HI> that is to say, On <HI>Tuesday,</HI> the <HI>Sentence against the Evil Works</HI> of these Men, must be executed. One of the Four, name∣ly, <HI>Condick,</HI> was Reprieved. As for <HI>Fly,</HI> he had been all along, a most uncommon and amazing In∣stance of Impenitency and Stupidity, and what <HI>Spectacles of Obduration</HI> the Wicked will be, when they have by a course of Wickedness under and a∣gainst Warnings, provoked the GOD of Heaven to withold His Influences from them. The Sullen and Raging Mood, into which he fell, upon his be∣ing first <HI>Imprison'd,</HI> caused him to break forth into furious Execrations, and Blasphemies too hideous to be mention'd; and not eat one morsel of any thing, but subsist only upon a little Drinking, for al∣most all the remaining part of his Life. He decli∣ned appearing in the Public Assemblies, on the <HI>Lords-day,</HI> with the other Prisoners, to be under the appointed means of Grace, because, forsooth, <HI>he would not have the Mob to gaze upon him.</HI> He seem'd all along ambitious to have it said, <HI>That he died a brave fellow</HI>▪ He pass'd along to the place of Exe∣cution, with a <HI>Nosegay</HI> in his hand, and making his <HI>Complements,</HI> where he <HI>thought he saw occasion.</HI> Arri∣ving there, he nimbly mounted the Stage, and would fain have put on a Smiling Aspect. He re∣proached the Hangman, for not understanding his Trade, and with his own Hands rectified matters, to render all things more Convenient and Effectu∣al.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="002779_0050_0FE5F67A7A5B6078"/>When he was called upon, to <HI>Speak</HI> what he should judge proper to be spoken on that sad occa∣sion, at least for the Warning of Survivers, he only said, That <HI>he would advise the Masters of Vessels to carry it well to their Men, lest they should be put upon do∣ing as he had done.</HI></P>
<P>At the same time, he declared his obstinate Re∣fusal, to <HI>Forgive</HI> the Person that had been the In∣strument of bringing him to Justice. When the Necessity of that <HI>Charity</HI> was urgently press'd upon him; and advantage taken from a Recital of the <HI>Lords-Prayer</HI> used among the Devotions of the Cri∣minals on the present Occasion, to urge it; he still persisted in his <HI>Unrelenting Frame</HI>; and an Expressi∣on of that Importance was in the last words, he Expired withal. But it was observed and is affirm'd, by some Spectators, that in the Midst of all his af∣fected <HI>Bravery,</HI> a very sensible <HI>Trembling</HI> attended him; His hands and his <HI>Knees</HI> were plainly seen to <HI>Tremble.</HI> — And so we must leave him for the <HI>Judgment to come.</HI></P>
<P>The other Two, <HI>Cole</HI> and <HI>Greenville,</HI> had much greater Signs of <HI>Repentance</HI> upon them. They made their <HI>Prayers,</HI> and seem'd continually <HI>praying,</HI> and much affected. They desired the Spectators to take <HI>Warning</HI> by them. And they mentioned Profane <HI>Swearing</HI> and <HI>Cursing,</HI> with <HI>Drunkenness</HI> and <HI>Sabbath-breaking,</HI> as Crimes which were now particularly grievous to them. They also justified the <HI>Court,</HI> as well as acknowledged the <HI>Justice</HI> of the Glorious GOD, in the Punishment they were now brought unto.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="002779_0051_0FE5F67B50866478"/>A Minister present having made a Pertinent and Pathetic <HI>Prayer,</HI> the Officer, willing that all that was possible might be done for their good, after some time, ask'd them, whether they would have another <HI>Prayer. Fly</HI> did not accept the offer, but said, <HI>If the other Two be Ready, I am</HI>! However, the <HI>other Two</HI> desiring it, another such <HI>prayer</HI> was made by another Minister; and after <HI>that,</HI> another by a Third; with which they joined attentively. (while <HI>Fly</HI> look'd about him unconcerned.)</P>
<P>Then the Execution was finished; And <HI>Fly</HI>'s Carcase hanged in Chains, on an Island, at the Entrance into <HI>Boston</HI>-Harbour.</P>
<P><HI>Cole,</HI> being one that could use his Pen, did on the Morning before his Execution, give out a Pa∣per, in which
<Q>he Lamented his early accustom∣ing of himself to Profane <HI>Swearing</HI>; and Blasphe∣mous <HI>Language</HI>; and Excessive <HI>Drinking</HI>; and his frequent <HI>stealing of Liquors</HI> from his Master, for the Satisfaction of them who hired him to do it. He added his bitter Lamentations, that when he came to <HI>Man's Estate,</HI> he abandoned himself to criminal Pleasures, to <HI>Drinking, Dan∣cing, Whoring,</HI> and the rest. He begg'd all <HI>Sea-faring-Men</HI> to take Warning by his Ignomi∣nious and Miserable Death; to which he was now brought, by the Enticements of the Wicked. He confess'd himself to be justly Condemned; and gave abundance of Thanks, for the Assistance of Good Ministers, and the wholesome Instructi∣ons and holy Directions they had given him, and
<PB N="50" REF="002779_0052_0FE632559C010588"/>
and express'd his Hope of entring into Heaven, by the Blood of His Glorious Redeemer.</Q>
And he earnestly desired, that this Paper might be pub∣lished to the World.</P>
<P>The poor Man, in the Prison, had owned unto a Minister, That from the Moment of the <HI>Murders</HI> on Board, he never had a minutes Quiet in his Mind, but was continually Meditating how to run away from the <HI>whole World,</HI> and if it were possible run away from <HI>himself.</HI> The Apprehension of his having some Intention to knock the <HI>Vessel</HI> on the Head, and perhaps the <HI>Captain,</HI> caused them, for some Days before Mr. <HI>Atkinson</HI>'s happy Revolution, to lay him in <HI>Irons,</HI> and every Day cruelly to be∣stow more than an Hundred Lashes upon him; whereof he continued Sore to his Death. He now saw the Glorious GOD, beginning to Execute on him <HI>His</HI> Vengeance, by the Hands of his <HI>own</HI> Bloo∣dy Companions: And he endured such <HI>Miseries,</HI> as made him look upon his forlorn Circumstances in the <HI>Boston</HI>-Gaol, as a sort of a Deliverance. It was <HI>there</HI> endeavoured, that this <HI>Construction</HI> of his <HI>Miseries</HI> might be set home upon him. However, it was admirable to see, how the Vengeance of GOD, sometimes makes <HI>Aceomplices</HI> in Sin, horri∣ble <HI>Scourges</HI> to one another!</P>
<P>It was a Saying of the <HI>Orientals, Happy is he, who corrects his Faults by the Faults of others.</HI> And now, <HI>Happy</HI> would our <HI>Sea-faring</HI> People particularly be, if the <HI>Crimes</HI> and the <HI>Ends</HI> of some whom they have seen <HI>Drowned in Perdition,</HI> might effectually cause them to beware of the <HI>Faults.</HI> with which they may any of them charge themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="002779_0053_0FE5F67E0799EC40"/>Upon those words used unto <HI>Achan</HI> just before his Execution, <HI>The Lord shall trouble them THIS DAY</HI>; the Jews have a Charitable Fancy, That on THAT DAY, he saw an end of all his <HI>Trouble</HI>; and that in the world to come he shall have no further <HI>Trouble,</HI> but be found among the Penitent and the Pardoned. With the <HI>Malefactors,</HI> who dy Penitent and Pardon∣ed, it will be so; But the Infallible Judgment of who are so, is what none but <HI>GOD the Judge of all, can determine.</HI></P>
