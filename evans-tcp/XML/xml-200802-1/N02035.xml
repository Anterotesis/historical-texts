<HEAD>To the HONOURABLE, William Dummer <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lieutenant GOVERNOUR and Commander in Chief, in &amp; over His Majesty's Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI> And to the HONOURABLE, His <HI>MAJESTY</HI>'s <HI>COUNCIL</HI> and the <HI>GENERAL ASSEMBLY.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following <HI>Sermon</HI> is a se∣rious &amp; humble <HI>Address</HI> to Your <HI>Honours</HI> on the behalf of <HI>Poste∣rity</HI> laying before You the <HI>Charge</HI> and Commandment of the <HI>Great GOD</HI> by Whom You rule, That You piously and faithfully use your best Endeavours, under <HI>His</HI> Blessing and by the Fa∣vour of our <HI>Gracious King, to leave those Civil &amp; Religious Priviledges</HI> which we now enjoy <HI>for an Inheritance to our Children after us.</HI></P>
<P>THE short and compendious way to this, is here laid before You from the Word of GOD, name∣ly, A religious <HI>seeking for and keeping all his Com∣mandments.</HI></P>
<P>IF GOD favour us it shall go well with us, the Royal Favour of our <HI>King</HI> to us being from HIM, and so all the Wisdom &amp; Success of Your <HI>Counsels.</HI> It is with GOD also to make all <HI>our Enemies</HI> (se∣cret
<PB N="ii" REF="002419_0005_0FDBD14B211C3240"/>
or open) <HI>to be at peace with us,</HI> or to turn their mischeivous Counsels <HI>into foolishness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PIETY</HI> is big with Blessings to the Publick, and also to every Person. But especially are <HI>pious Rulers</HI> a singular Benefit and Glory to any Peo∣ple. They are <HI>an Image of</HI> CHRIST <HI>in his Offices &amp; Government</HI>; the <HI>Prophet</HI> and <HI>Prince</HI> are uni∣ted in them; and <HI>Men shall be blessed</HI> in them, all People <HI>shall call them blessed.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Fathers</HI> of this <HI>Province</HI> came hither <HI>to seek for and to keep all the Commandments of God,</HI> and (by His will and grace) <HI>to leave these into their Children after them, for ever.</HI> So the <HI>General Court</HI> in effect told <HI>King Charles the Second,</HI> in their <HI>Address</HI> to him in the Year 1661.
<Q>We supplicate Your Majesty (<HI>said they</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>story of <HI>New-England</HI>; by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> p. 332.</NOTE>) for Your gracious Protection of us, in the Continuance both of our Civil and Religious Liberties, accor∣ding to <HI>the Grantees known End of suing for the Patent,</HI> conferr'd upon this Plantation by your Royal Father. Our Liberty to walk in the way of the Gospel, with all good Consciences according to the Order of the Gospel, was the <HI>Cause</HI> of our transporting our selves with our Wives, our little ones and our substance, from that pleasant Land, over the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, into the vast Wilder∣ness, chusing rather the pure Scripture Worship with a good Conscience in this remote Wilder∣ness, than the pleasures of <HI>England</HI> with Sub∣mission, to the Impositions of the then so dispo∣sed, and so far prevailing <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> which we
<PB N="iii" REF="002419_0006_0FDBD14D688B8058"/>
could not do without an evil Conscience.— We are not seditious, as to the Interest of <HI>Caesar</HI>; nor schismatical, as to matters of Religion. We distinguish between Churches and their Impuri∣ties.— We could not live without the Publick Worship of GOD nor be permitted the Publick Worship without <HI>such a Yoke of Subscription &amp; Con∣formity,</HI> as we could not consent unto without Sin. That we might therefore enjoy Divine Worship <HI>without human Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tures,</HI> without offence to God, Man and our own Consciences, we with <HI>Leave,</HI> but not without <HI>Tears</HI> departed from our Coun∣try, Kindred and Fathershouses, into this <HI>Patmos.</HI></Q></P>
<P>SO dearly did <HI>our Fathers</HI> purchase, and thus highly did they prise, those <HI>Charter</HI> Privileges, and Religious Liberties, which some among us are too ready now to make light of. Let us, <HI>my Fathers,</HI> as zealously affect the <HI>Preservation</HI> of them, as they did the <HI>Acquisition</HI> of them; That so our <HI>Posterity</HI> may be in some manner beholden to us as we are to our <HI>Ancestors</HI>; and that <HI>Your Names</HI> may live in the <HI>Annals</HI> of these Churches, as <HI>Theirs</HI> do, after a peaceful and happy Death.</P>
<P>IT is a master of great Thankfulness to GOD, and ough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be observed unto his Glory, that we see the Body of our <HI>Rulers,</HI> and so many of the Men of <HI>Estate</HI> among us, so well principled and establish'd in the Cause of God among us. It is a singular Mercy to us, our Ornament and Defence, that we see so many <HI>laudable Exam∣ples</HI> of Sobriety and Temperance, Frugality and Diligence, Charity, Humility and Devotion, in the Houses of our <HI>Superiour</HI> People. And here
<PB N="iv" REF="002419_0007_0FDBD14FD1AADB90"/>
also we shall find some of the best Instances of strict <HI>Family-Government,</HI> and a careful Institu∣tion of their <HI>Children</HI> in the Principles and ways of our Fathers. You cannot better express a <HI>faith∣ful Love</HI> to GOD, your Country, your Children, and your own Souls, than in so doing</P>
<P>AND now that I am speaking of this good Spirit for the Publick and for <HI>Futurity,</HI> as the singular Duty and Ornament of the <HI>Rulers</HI> of a People; give me leave to add—That it was <HI>this</HI> which built our <HI>College</HI> even in the Infancy of the <HI>Colony,</HI> and which has supported and endow'd it to this day. GOD has from time to time rais'd up kind <HI>Friends</HI> and generous <HI>Benefactors</HI> to that Society, both from among <HI>our selves,</HI> and also from <HI>abroad.</HI> We have our <HI>living</HI> Benefactors with us, and we see the <HI>Children</HI> of Those that are <HI>deceased.</HI> We hope that <HI>Posterity will not forget</HI> the Kindness of God which they have shewn; and we trust that <HI>GOD will remember it for good</HI> to Them and theirs.</P>
<P>BUT I owe unto <HI>GOD</HI> and to my <HI>Country</HI> a very particular and most grateful mention of the late <HI>bounties</HI> of the Worthy &amp; Pious Mr. THOMAS HOLLIS of <HI>London</HI> unto our College; to ask the <HI>Praises</HI> of my People to the Blessed GOD, whose the Marvellous Work is; and to ask their <HI>Prayers</HI> to GOD for so great a <HI>Benefactor</HI> to Us and to our Children. GOD has put it into his heart to lay a great <HI>Foundation</HI> this last Year for the Glory of CHRIST, and the good of our <HI>Posterity,</HI> even <HI>for ever</HI>; if it please the <HI>Divine Providence</HI> to crown his Design and Desires with a Blessing. <HI>Ten</HI> of our Sons, the poorer and the more prompt and
<PB N="v" REF="002419_0008_0FDBD15247153F68"/>
pious, are to receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Pounds</HI> each, towards their Education for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Service of CHRIST in the Work of the <HI>Ministry</HI> among us. And moreover the LORD has enlarg'd his heart to give us no less than <HI>Eighty</HI> pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for the Maintenance of <HI>a Professor of Divinity</HI> in the <HI>College</HI>; where a <HI>very worthy One</HI> is Establish'd, who is reading <HI>Lectures</HI> to the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣dents</HI> every week, in publick and in private; to their great Spiritual Advantage (we trust) &amp; for their Improvement in sacred knowledge.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sons of New-England</HI> must for ever ac∣knowledge Mr. HOLLIS for a <HI>Father</HI> to them; and I trust that GOD means <HI>to give</HI> Him in many of them <HI>a better Name than of Sons &amp; of Daughters</HI>; besides that <HI>Everlasting Name</HI> among the Children of GOD <HI>that shall never be cut off.</HI> Yea the <HI>Churches of New-England</HI> will gratefully own Mr. HOLLIS to be made by GOD a <HI>Nursing Fa∣ther</HI> to them, while <HI>His Professor</HI> shall (by the will of GOD) from Generation to Generation be feeding our <HI>Sons</HI> with the <HI>Sincere Milk of the Word,</HI> and they <HI>these Flocks of our Lord Jesus Christ</HI> with the same.</P>
<P>THUS it pleases GOD to be speaking in His gracious Providence concerning our <HI>Posterity,</HI> con∣cerning the <HI>College</HI> and these <HI>Churches,</HI> for times to come; if we will <HI>be seeking for &amp; keeping all His Commandments</HI>; which is the thing that our pious <HI>Friend</HI> &amp; <HI>Benefactor</HI> has at heart in all <HI>this Bounty to us.</HI></P>
<P>AT the same time GOD has pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to inspire several very Reverend <HI>Ministers in London,</HI> with a
<PB N="vi" REF="002419_0009_0FDBD155C85EDA50"/>
natural &amp; earnest Care for our Interest, Civil and Religious, even as if They had been born of us, or we of Them. Such is the fervent &amp; tender Sol∣licitude, which they express for the weal &amp; flou∣rishing of our <HI>Country,</HI> our <HI>College,</HI> &amp; our <HI>Churches</HI>; and lest we or our Posterity should lose our preci∣cious Liberties. They know us not, nor can have any Benefit by us; but they are known to CHRIST, and are His Servants, and seek His glory; and for JESUS <HI>sake</HI> they wish our Good, Tem∣poral &amp; Spiritual: <HI>Because of the House of the Lord our GOD they seek our Good.</HI> Now while GOD moves thus the Hearts of <HI>distant Friends,</HI> who ne∣ver saw us, to seek the Preservation &amp; Propagation of <HI>Religion &amp; Learning</HI> to our Posterity; shall not we our selves much more feel this Concern for our selves? to <HI>keep</HI> those good things committed to us, and to <HI>leave</HI> them <HI>for an Inheritance unto our Children after us, for ever?</HI></P>
<P>I have thus cast into a <HI>new Form,</HI> and by way of <HI>Preface</HI> said, some of those things which I omit∣ted, when the Time &amp; my Strength fail'd me in the Delivery of the following <HI>Sermon</HI>: Which that it may be accompanied with the Divine Blessing to them that read it, is the Prayer of</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL><HI>I. Chron. XXVIII. 8.</HI></BIBL>
<Q>Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the Congregation of the Lord, and in the Audi∣ence of our God, keep &amp; seek for all the Commandments of the Lord your God: that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an Inheritance to your Children after you, for ever.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE are some of the last Words of <HI>David,</HI> the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> the LORD's Prophet, and the Father of his People. He spake them to <HI>an assembly of the Princes of the Tribes of Israel,</HI> their <HI>Captains &amp; Officers,</HI> whom he had summon'd together to receive his last Will and <HI>Charge.</HI> The Subject whereon he now discours'd them, was as became
<PB N="2" REF="002419_0011_0FDBD15A982F8B28"/>
a <HI>dying</HI> King &amp; Saint, <HI>the Worship &amp; House of GOD</HI> among them; that <HI>this</HI> might be their Care after his decease, and that with Religion the Favour and Blessing of God might be entail'd upon them, and on their Children after them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Aged King</HI> had been very <HI>weak</HI> and like to die before this, but seems to have some little <HI>revival,</HI> some return of vital warmth and heat, and thus he improv'd it; he would once more see his <HI>Nobles</HI> and Officers about him, and give them his last <HI>Char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and Blessing, and take his last <HI>leave</HI> of them. <HI>So</HI> it became the King of <HI>Israel</HI> to die.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>this illustrious Assembly</HI> presented them∣selves before him, <HI>the King stood up upon his feet,</HI> ver. 2. God strengthen'd him for this last and noble Act of his life He had a Message from God to deliver to them, and it became him to shew this reverence. He also honour'd as well as lov'd the noble Persons whom he spake to; and they were worthy of this respect from their King: <HI>the Princes of the people of the God of Abraham; his Brethren and the People of his God.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY he bespeaks them with af∣fection and respect, <HI>Hear me my Brethren and my people.</HI> Humility becomes and adorns even Kings themselves. It is a truly royal Robe wherewith they should be cloth'd. Nor should it be put on only as a grave-cloth when they come to die, and must be laid in the dust.</P>
<P>THE <HI>King</HI> inform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his Nobles here of his own good will and desire to have built the Temple of God; an house of Rest for the Ark of his Cove∣nant, and for the Honour of his Name; but that
<PB N="3" REF="002419_0012_0FDBD15CE5A0D7D0"/>
God had forbid him and had reserv'd that great and good Work for his Son after him. He informs them however how he had prepared and made ready for the building; that God had chosen <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> for his Successor in the Kingdom, and had promis'd concerning him that he should build his House; had promis'd to be his Father, &amp; to establish his Kingdom for ever, if with a filial piety he con∣tinued in obedience to him. This is the short and summary of the <HI>King's Speech,</HI> to the Words of my Text—<HI>Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the Congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God; keep &amp; seek for all the Commandments of the Lord your God; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e may possess this g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Land, and leave it for an Inheritance to your Chil∣dren after you, for ever.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Words are a very grave and solemn Charge, whereof we may consider, 1. The <HI>matter</HI> of it; that they shou'd <HI>keep &amp; seek for all the Commandments of the Lord their God.</HI> The know∣ledge and observance of God's Commandments is the summ of God's Charge and Will left with his People. They must set themselves to <HI>keep</HI> his Commandments even <HI>all</HI> of them; and in order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this they must <HI>seek for</HI> them all, to know the whole of their duty, "What they knew they must be sure, to keep, &amp; they must seek for what they knew not.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Charge is deliver'd with much <HI>Solemnity. In the sight of all Israel, the Congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God.</HI> What could be said more solemn?</P>
<P N="1">1. Sayes the King, I charge you <HI>in the sight of all Israel.</HI> As if they were all here present, and wit∣nesses
<PB N="4" REF="002419_0013_0FDBD15F3A3F4140"/>
of what I say: <HI>that Israel</HI> whose Princes &amp; Officers you are, and as whose <HI>Representatives</HI> you here stand; as in the sight and hearing of <HI>all Israel,</HI> to whom the Words which I now speak will soon come.</P>
<P>Moreover, 2. Consider ye that this people is <HI>the Lord's Congregation.</HI> The greater therefore was the trust and charge of <HI>these Princes,</HI> the Heads of this Congregation of the Lord; who would be the greater Witnesses for or against their Princes, if they should seek and keep the Com∣mandments of God or not do it. But if it were awful to be charg'd as in their sight,</P>
<P>How much more was it for them to consider, 3. That it was <HI>in the audience of God Himself</HI> that they were now spoken to. In the sight of all Is∣rael, and <HI>in the audience of our God.</HI> HE is pre∣sent with us, said the <HI>dying King</HI>; I speak to you in <HI>His</HI> Name; HE sees and hears us; He is a witness, and so are his Congregation of what I say to you; and as you fear Him or tender his favour, regard what I say unto you.—To all this <HI>Solem∣nity</HI> in the Words, we must yet further observe in 'em,</P>
<P N="3">3. An <HI>Argument</HI> referr'd unto, and a <HI>Motive</HI> added.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is a great <HI>Argument, Reason</HI> or <HI>Motive</HI> referr'd unto. <HI>Now therefore</HI>; so begins my text. It refers to the preceeding discourse of <HI>David</HI>'s: <HI>q. d.</HI> Since I have by the direction and favour of God, made such provision for the building a House to his Name and Worship, and since God has cho∣sen <HI>Solomon</HI> to build it, and promised to be with
<PB N="5" REF="002419_0014_0FDBD1625F6EC890"/>
him in it; and to establish his Kingdom for ever-if he and you be constant in his Commandments▪ <HI>Now ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore</HI> I require &amp; charge you in the sight of all Israel and in the audience of our God that ye keep and seek for all the Commandments of the Lord your God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As you regard God and his Worship, value his favour, or fear his anger; and as you would have <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State</HI> remain in a flourishing condition; see that you be observant of the <HI>Lord's Commands</HI> even <HI>all</HI> of them. The House of God in <HI>Israel,</HI> and the Kingdom in the House of <HI>David</HI> depended on it.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a <HI>Motive</HI> added in the close of the Text: <HI>That ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an Inheritance for your Children after you, for ever.</HI> Before they were mov'd from the Ho∣nour &amp; Glory to the Name of GOD; here they are mov'd from their own and their Children's tempo∣ral welfare. They were possess'd of a good land; they held it by the promise of GOD upon their Obedience to Him; they would desire to keep the possession they had of it, and that their Children should inherit it after them; But then they must needs seek for and keep the Commandments of the Lord their God, if they would have a peaceable &amp; quiet possession of their pleasant land secured to them, or to their Children after them.</P>
<P>THESE are the Arguments and Motives with which the duty required in the text is inforced.</P>
<P>I shall now name some <HI>Doctrinal Observations.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THAT the People of God in general, the Rulers of a people in particular, and every single
<PB N="6" REF="002419_0015_0FDBD1636D84D500"/>
person belonging to the Congregation of the Lord, are under the strict charge of GOD to seek &amp; keep all His Commandments.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> THAT as every Superior in the state or in the Church, is under this Charge himself, so it is his duty to lay it upon all that are under him, and to leave it as his dying Charge with them.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> THAT we should every one of us seri∣ously consider, that it is in the sight of all the Lord's people, the Congregation of the Lord, and in the Audience of our GOD, that we are under this Charge.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> THAT the Church, Kingdom and Wor∣ship of CHRIST among us, the House of our GOD, depends on our religious seeking &amp; keeping of GOD's Commandments.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> THAT this is the way to keep possession of this good Land which the Lord our God has given us, and to leave it for an Inheritance unto our Children after us.</P>
<P>I. <HI>THAT the People of God in general, the Rulers of a people in particular, and every single person among them, are under the strict Charge of GOD to seek for &amp; keep all His Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>SO they are charged, and this is the Charge in our text. And here I shall say, 1 This is the Charge of the Lord our God. 2 We are all under it. 3. The Rulers of a People are so in an espe∣cial manner.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS is <HI>the Charge</HI> of the Lord our God, that we keep and seek for all His Commandments▪
<PB N="7" REF="002419_0016_0FDBD164F9F2A7E0"/>
We have his Commandments in his <HI>Word.</HI> They are the Laws, Statutes, Testimonies, and Judgments of the Lord our God; and in short <HI>His Covenant</HI> with his people. <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets have han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed them down to us; and CHRIST (the Eternal Son of GOD, and Lord of all the Holy Prophets) has confirm'd &amp; ratify'd them. Moses bespeaks the Church for ever in the 4. <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Deut. Behold, I have taught you statutes &amp; judgments, as the Lord my God commanded me: ye shall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it: And what Nation is there so great, that hath statutes &amp; judgments so righteous, as all this Law which I set before you?</HI> Now, says the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE must religiously <HI>keep</HI> the Command∣ments of the Lord our God. Laws are made, and Gods laws are written to us, to be observed &amp; kept. A Commandment implies Obedience. We must needs be <HI>sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect</HI> to the <HI>Power</HI> that is over us, to give laws and to judge us by the laws, both for <HI>wrath</HI> &amp; for <HI>Conscience</HI> sake. The law is to rule &amp; govern us▪ To <HI>keep</HI> the Commandment is to do it; to observe &amp; obey it with our hearts and in our lives. We must keep it in our minds and hide it in our hearts, that we may not sin against it, transgress and break it, in tho't word or deed. We must therefore keep our Souls diligently that we may keep God's word. The keeping it implies care, diligence, constancy &amp; pleasure. Faith, fear, love, reverence, esteem of the word, and desire to ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se and glorify God, do all meet in every act of accep∣table Obedience to God. Deut. 10 12. <HI>What doth

the Lord thy God require of thee? but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul; to keep the Commandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I command thee this day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WE must keep <HI>all</HI> the Commandments. So the text requires. Our Obedience must be uni∣versal. What body of Laws is there but Obedi∣ence is equally required to them all. What single Law was ever given, but to be obeyed? The same Authority enacts one &amp; another of them. <HI>Every word of God is pure</HI>; all his Commands are holy, just &amp; good. He that breaks one law is a trans∣gressor, and liable to the Judgment. <HI>He that of∣fends in one point is guilty of all,</HI> Jam. 2.18. He might as well offend in another point: He offers indignity to the Power that made the whole law. Obedience in some things will not excuse disobedi∣ence in others. Exod. 24.7. <HI>All that the Lord our God shall say to us, we will do and be obedient.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IN order to this we must <HI>seek for them all.</HI> Keep and <HI>seek</HI> for all the Commandments of the Lord your God. We must be careful &amp; inqui∣sitive to <HI>know</HI> the Commands, if ever we would keep them. We must seek the knowledge of them with desire and care and pains. We need not seek <HI>jar</HI> for the Commands; which we have in our hands and before our eyes: Deut. 30.11, 12. <HI>This Commandment which I command thee this day is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off: but the word is very nigh to thee, in thy Mouth and in thy heart; that thou mayst do it.</HI> Yet neither must we grudge
<PB N="9" REF="002419_0018_0FDBD16BCE06F140"/>
any <HI>pains</HI> or labour that is necessary unto our get∣ting the knowledge of God's will. It is highly worth the most diligent &amp; laborious seeking. Prov. 2. beg. <HI>My son, incline thine ear to wisdom, and apply thy heart to understanding; cry after know∣ledge &amp; lift up thy voice for understanding; seek her as silver &amp; search for her as for hid trea∣sure; so shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. We must therefore <HI>search the Scriptures</HI> which are written for our learning. We must read therein daily; read it in our <HI>Closets,</HI> read it in our <HI>Families.</HI> We must seek the law at the mouth of Gods <HI>Ministers,</HI> whose lips must preserve know∣ledge, <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.7. It was the honour and blessing of <HI>Levi,</HI> and a Blessing to <HI>Israel</HI>; Deut. 33.10. <HI>He shall teach Jacob God's judgments, &amp; Israel his laws.</HI> We must be <HI>waiting daily at God's Gates,</HI> and at his <HI>doors.</HI> We must seek unto God by <HI>Prayer</HI> for his light &amp; his truth; that he would teach us his statutes &amp; lead us into all truth; Psal 119.34. <HI>Give me understanding and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.</HI> Thus we must <HI>seek for,</HI> if we would <HI>keep</HI> the Commandments of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. AND lastly, This is <HI>the Charge</HI> of the Lord our God to us: <HI>Now therefore keep &amp; seek for all the Commandments of the Lord your God.</HI> The Lord is <HI>our God,</HI> and it belongs to <HI>Him</HI> to charge us. He has <HI>made</HI> us, made us to <HI>obey</HI> him, made us to be rul'd &amp; govern'd by <HI>law</HI>: He has given us his Charge, as our <HI>King</HI> &amp; Lord, and as our <HI>Father</HI> in heaven. His <HI>Commands</HI> are his charge to us, and then he has <HI>charg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> us to keep, observe and do
<PB N="10" REF="002419_0019_0FDBD16D2DCA55F8"/>
them. Agreably to what we read, Eccl. 8.2. <HI>I charge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thou keep the Kings Comman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment.</HI> The Lord is our King, our Saviour and our Judge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we are under his charge His Charge to us is like that, 1 Tim. 6.13. <HI>I cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge thee before God —that thou keep my Commandments without spot; unrebukable.</HI> It is <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st good</HI> for us to be so charged; m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st kind and good in God, that he has laid so strict a Charge upon us to mind our duty and pur∣sue our happiness. But it should be also exceeding <HI>awful</HI> to us to be so required and commanded by God; and we must diligently and <HI>obsequiously</HI> set our selves to know and do what the Lord our God requires. 1 Kings 2.3. <HI>Keep the Charge of the Lord thy God; to walk in his ways, as it is written in his law.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this for the 1st thing; that this is the <HI>Charge of the Lord our God</HI> that we keep his laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>ALL the people</HI> of God together, and every <HI>single person</HI> by himself, are under this charge of God. So is the text directed, and so are all the Commandments of the Holy Word.</P>
<P N="1">1. TO all of us together, as a people of God, and as the Lord's Congregation. <HI>Hear O my people and I will speak! Hear this all ye people, both high and low, rich &amp; poor together.</HI> 2. To each Indi∣vidual; to every single person; who are as much meant and spoken to as if they were named. For every one is equally known to God, observed by him, and will be bro't into Judgment. So the <HI>Covenant</HI> of the Lord was with the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> with all together, and with every single person apart: Deut. 29.10,—20. <HI>Ye stand this
<PB N="11" REF="002419_0020_0FDBD171891E1758"/>
day all of you before the Lord your God, your Cap∣tains, Elders, Officers and all the Men of Israel; your little ones, your wives, and the stranger that is in thy Camp; from the hewer of thy wood unto the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awer of thy water; that thou shouldest enter into Covenant with the Lord thy God and into his Oath, and that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and to be unto thee a GOD: Neither with you only do I make this Covenant &amp; this Oath; but with him also that is not here with us this day; lest there should be among you Man or Woman or Family or Tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God; and it come to pass when he heareth the Words of this Curse that he bless himself, saying, I shall have peace:— the Lord will not spare him, but the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and the Lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, &amp; all the Curses that are written in this Book shall come upon him.</HI> Thus awfully is a whole place or people, and every particular per∣son under the Commandment and Charge of God·</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Rulers</HI> of a people are in a particular and peculiar manner, under this Charge of God to keep and seek for all his Commandments. To them <HI>David</HI> speaks in the text, and by them to all <HI>Israel</HI>: And unto them <HI>Moses</HI> deliver'd the Charge and Covenant of God, that they should see it kept by all under them. As the least and <HI>lowest</HI> in the Congregation are not overlook'd by God, so the <HI>highest</HI> and the greatest are especially observed and commanded by him.</P>
<P>SO is the <HI>King</HI> upon the throne, and the Law
<PB N="12" REF="002419_0021_0FDBD1726AFCDA30"/>
to him is, Deut. 17.19. <HI>That he have a Copy of God's Law with him, and that he read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all the words of his Law.</HI></P>
<P>HOW much more then are all <HI>Ministers of State, Governours, Judges &amp; Officers</HI> commissioned by the King, under the Law and Charge of God; to observe his Word themselves, and see it reverenc'd and observ'd by those that are under them. They are to go before their people, leading them by their <HI>Example,</HI> influencing by their <HI>Reputation</HI> &amp; interest, and constraining by their <HI>Authority</HI> and power, to a reverend observance of the Will and Worship of God. To this end <HI>Moses</HI> gave <HI>Joshua</HI> a Charge before he died, and commanded the <HI>Le∣vites</HI>; and sent out his Summons, Deut. 31.28. <HI>Gather unto me all the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ders of your Tribes and your Officers, that I may speak all these words in their ears, &amp; call beaven &amp; earth to record against them.</HI> So <HI>Joshua</HI> called for the <HI>Heads &amp; Elders of Israel to Shechem,</HI> &amp; they presented themselves be∣fore the Lord, and he set them a <HI>Statute</HI> &amp; an <HI>Or∣dinance.</HI> So <HI>Solomon</HI> spake to <HI>every Governour in all Israel,</HI> the chief of the fathers. And to name no more, So <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI> commanded the <HI>Levites</HI> and <HI>Judges</HI> in his day; —<HI>Let the fear of the Lord be upon you,</HI> (said he) <HI>with whom there is no Ini∣quity nor respect of persons; and he charged them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, faithfully and with a perfect heart; lest wrath come upon you &amp; on your Brethren: deal c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uragi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usly and the Lord shall be with the good.</HI>— These are the Commandment &amp; <HI>Charges</HI> of God which <HI>Magis∣trates</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="002419_0022_0FDBD17409EEBD68"/>
and <HI>Ministers</HI> are yet under, according to the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, made known unto all Nations for their Obedience.</P>
<P>LET our <HI>Rulers</HI> therefore suffer the Word of <HI>Exhortation,</HI> and the Admonition from God to them, that <HI>They</HI> eminently among the People of God are under his Commandment and his Charge to <HI>seek for and keep his holy Commandments.</HI> And it is fit that they should be so charged by God for his <HI>Glory,</HI> whose Ministers and Servants they are, and for the <HI>Good</HI> of Mankind, whereunto they must Minister according to his Will. It is the peculiar Honour of God to command them, and to be obeyed by them, as also to judge and punish them; and it is a peculiar Honour to them to be Examples of Obedience to God. Psalm. 97.7. <HI>Worship him all ye Gods.</HI> The <HI>Principalities</HI> and <HI>Powers</HI> above do so, and how much more should those on Earth? Eccles. 5.8. <HI>He that is higher than the highest regardeth, and there be higher than they.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as a <HI>personal</HI> Subjection and Obedience to all the Commandments of God is the duty of <HI>Rulers,</HI> so are they obliged also, both in their <HI>Le∣gislative,</HI> and also in their <HI>Executive</HI> capacity and trust <HI>to seek for</HI> all the Commandments of the Lord; That they be all of them made <HI>known</HI> to the people under their care, and <HI>enjoyned</HI> on them, and that none be suffer'd in the Violation of any of them This is the Duty of their place, and they should voluntarily but with Solemnity come under <HI>this Bond</HI> upon their Souls; as the Rulers of <HI>Israel</HI> did, Neh. 9. <HI>ult. We make a sure Cove∣nant
<PB N="14" REF="002419_0023_0FDBD17A9DD77B08"/>
&amp; write it; and our Princes, Levites &amp; Priests seal to it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I come to the <HI>Second</HI> Observation:</P>
<P>II. <HI>THAT as every Superior in the State or in the Church is under this Charge of God himself, so it is their duty to charge it upon all that are under them, yea &amp; to leave it with them as their dying charge.</HI></P>
<P>SO <HI>David</HI> did in my text; and the record of it leaves him as a standing and teaching <HI>Example</HI>; whether we consider him as a <HI>Father,</HI> as a <HI>Prince,</HI> or as a <HI>Prophet,</HI> or as one full of <HI>Dayes,</HI> and <HI>dying.</HI></P>
<P>SO <HI>Parents</HI> and Governours of Familys should charge their Children and houshold after them to seek and keep the Commandments of God. So did <HI>Abraham</HI>; of whom God said, <HI>I know him that he will command his Children &amp; his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</HI> So did <HI>Joshua</HI>; who declared before all <HI>Israel, As for me &amp; my house we will serve the Lord.</HI> And the 101st <HI>Psalm</HI> stands an everlasting record of <HI>David</HI>'s Rule &amp; Government of his own house: <HI>I will walk in my house with a perfect heart; my eyes shall be upon the faithful of the Land that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me.</HI></P>
<P>I have said before, and have exhibited several illustrious Examples, how <HI>Rulers</HI> should require and constrain their <HI>Subjects</HI> to keep the word of God. For <HI>this</HI> they are invested with their Legislative and Executive powers; and <HI>are Or∣dained of God</HI>; to be <HI>terrors to evil doers and a
<PB N="15" REF="002419_0024_0FDBD17B91869280"/>
praise to them that do well</HI>; to defend the Name, the Word, the Day, the Worship and Ordinanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of God from profanation; and that all under t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m may <HI>lead a peaceable &amp; quiet life, in godliness and honesty.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if we consider <HI>David</HI> as a <HI>Prophet</HI> his Ex∣ample is a law &amp; rule also unto the <HI>Ministers of Religion.</HI> And none are more obliged than <HI>they</HI> to lay the Commands &amp; Charge of God before o∣thers; and to require all in his name, even the highest with the lowest; to charge them that are <HI>rich</HI> in the world and them that are <HI>poor</HI> together, in His Name who is <HI>the Maker of them both</HI>; to <HI>speak, rebuke &amp; exhort with all Authority, &amp; without partiality.</HI> Wherefore in Obedience to my <HI>text</HI> I <HI>magnify my Office</HI> this day; and being called by the <HI>Rulers</HI> of my People to speak unto <HI>Themselves</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Great GOD,</HI> by Whom they rule; I do in His fear &amp; from His Word lay before Them their Duty, to God &amp; this People; both that they keep the Commandments of God themselves, and charge theirs after them to do so too; yea, and as far as in them lies, to bind their Successors to a faithful adherence to the Cause of God. And herein you must needs <HI>obey</HI> your <HI>Ministers</HI> as those that have <HI>this Rule</HI>; and <HI>submit</HI> your selves, as unto them that <HI>watch</HI> for your Souls, and must give <HI>account</HI> unto God.</P>
<P>BUT then lastly it is to be consider'd, That whoever we are, Rulers, Ministers, Parents, Masters; within a little time we shall have served our Ge∣neration, and the time will come that we must <HI>die</HI>; And if while we <HI>live</HI> we lay the Charges of God
<PB N="16" REF="002419_0025_0FDBD17CF3001F30"/>
upon them that are under us, and who are like to survive us; so when we are <HI>Old</HI> &amp; gray-headed, if God spare us to old age; or when the Day of our <HI>Death</HI> comes on, as it surely will in a short time; Then let us like <HI>Jacob</HI> &amp; <HI>Joseph,</HI> like <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Joshua,</HI> like <HI>Samuel</HI> &amp; <HI>David</HI> (by the Grace of God) leave our <HI>dying Testimony</HI> to the good ways of God, our <HI>dying Prayers</HI> for the Church &amp; King∣dom of <HI>Christ</HI> in the midst of us, and our <HI>dying Com∣mandment</HI> to our Children &amp; Families, that after our Decease they still <HI>seek for &amp; keep all the Com∣mandments of the Lord our God.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING can be either more <HI>humane</HI> or more <HI>pious</HI> than this Care for <HI>Posterity</HI>; Nothing more worthy of us either as <HI>Men</HI> or as <HI>Christians,</HI> than this desire to <HI>perpetuate</HI> the Religion of God, his Worship &amp; Obedience to Him, in succeeding Ge∣nerations. God has therefore most strictly enjoy∣ned <HI>this</HI> upon his professing People: Witness that famous place of <HI>Scripture,</HI> Deut. 6.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <HI>Hear O Israel, The LORD our God is One LORD. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these Words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently un∣to thy Children; and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou ris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st up: And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, and they shall be as frontlets between thy eyes: And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.</HI></P>
<P>YOU see here that the Care of God is for his
<PB N="17" REF="002419_0026_0FDBD181A9352220"/>
own Glory, as in the present so also in the <HI>Coming Generation</HI>; and that he therefore commits them to us as our special Trust, and charges us with them; that as the <HI>Prophet</HI> speaks, Isai. 59.21. <HI>His Word which is in our mouth may not depart out of the mouth of our seed, nor out of the mouth of our seeds seed, even for ever.</HI></P>
<P>SO <HI>David died,</HI> and these were his <HI>lust Words,</HI> who was <HI>the Anointed of the God of Jacob,</HI> and the <HI>sweet Psa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mist of Israel!</HI> The <HI>Spirit of God</HI> spake by Him, and the <HI>Word of the LORD</HI> was in his tongue; and He expir'd speaking the Words which <HI>Israels Rock</HI> and GOD had spoke to him. He breath'd out his Soul in <HI>that Prayer</HI> to God for his People and for his Son, 1 Chron. 29.18, 19. <HI>O GOD of Abraham, Isaac &amp; Israel our Fathers, keep this for ever in the Imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart un∣to thee! And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy Commandments, thy Testimonies and thy Statutes.</HI></P>
<P>NOW as <HI>this</HI> has been the noble, generous and enlarged View of <HI>Patriarchs</HI> &amp; <HI>Prophets,</HI> for the glory of God and the good of Souls in all times to come; so let me observe to You (and give the Praise to God) that the <HI>Fathers of this Country</HI> did eminently inherit this great &amp; good Spirit, and herein approv'd Themselves like <HI>Judah, ruling with God &amp; faithful with the Saints.</HI> They go∣vern'd their Houses strictly, they taught their Children diligently, they endeavoured earnestly to instill early into them the highest Reverence of Gods Name, his Word, his Day, his Ordinances,
<PB N="18" REF="002419_0027_0FDBD182F659F4A8"/>
and his Worshipers; They set up <HI>Schools,</HI> they founded a <HI>College,</HI> for a succession of <HI>Pastors</HI> in the Churches and <HI>to seek a godly Seed</HI> for <HI>Christ</HI> in this place of their Sepulchres, as long as the Sun and Moon should endure. So they approv'd them∣selves the Children of <HI>faithful Abraham, the Friend of God,</HI> whose Everlasting praise is in the Churches, that <HI>He commanded his Children &amp; Houshold after h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, that they should keep the Way of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>I go on to the third <HI>Doctrinal Observation.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>THAT we ought every one of us seriously to consider; that it is in the sight of all the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s people, and in the Audience of our God that we are so charged, taught and warned, to keep &amp; seek for all his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are <HI>two</HI> weighty Motives and power∣ful Arguments to quicken and excite us unto the discharge of the duty incumbent on us. They should sink deep into our hearts, and yet ly upper∣most too in them, and be ever in our memory, that <HI>in the sight of all Israel,</HI> and <HI>in the audience of our God,</HI> we are bound, and have bound our selves, to seek and keep all God's Commandments.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IN the sight of all the Lord's people</HI> we are so bound, are so charged and have so promised. All the people of God are witnesses for and against one another, that <HI>this charge of the Lord</HI> is laid and lying upon every <HI>Order,</HI> and upon every <HI>Person</HI> among us. So <HI>Magistrates are Sworn,</HI> in the sight of all the Lords people, even as <HI>Moses</HI> gave <HI>Joshua</HI> a charge before <HI>all Israel,</HI> when he was plac'd at the head of the Congregation of the Lord: <HI>Numb.</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="002419_0028_0FDBD1846CAF1A28"/>
27.23. And as <HI>Jehojada</HI> gave to <HI>Jehoash</HI> the <HI>Testimony</HI> when he put the <HI>Crown</HI> upon his head, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 11.12 So our <HI>Kings</HI> are under <HI>a Corona∣tion Oath,</HI> to seek and keep the Commandments of the LORD and to govern by his Word. And all our <HI>Rulers</HI> are <HI>sworn</HI> to observe it and rule by it. And they should always remember it, that <HI>all the People</HI> are witnesses of the <HI>Oath of God</HI> which they are under. It was a <HI>Solemnity</HI> that not only put honour upon <HI>Joshua</HI> before all <HI>Israel,</HI> but which also was to impress him with an awful and reverend sense of his Duty to God and his peo∣ple. Said God to <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, Take thee Joshua and set him before Eleazer the priest and before all the Con∣gregation, and give him a charge in their sight,</HI> He was charged <HI>with</HI> the People of the Lord; they were <HI>put</HI> into his hand, as sheep into the hand of a shepherd; and therefore it was done in their <HI>sight</HI> and presence: As to express their own <HI>Con∣sent</HI> and <HI>Subjection</HI> to the Government, so to be witnesses of his Sacred <HI>Promise</HI> &amp; <HI>Engagement</HI> to rule them in God's fear and by his word.</P>
<P>IN like manner <HI>Ministers</HI> are Ordained pub∣lickly, and solemnly charged <HI>before the Congrega∣tion of the Lord,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.11, 12. <HI>Thou O man of God, follow after Righteousness, Godliness, Faith, Love, Patience, Meekness; fight the good fight, lay hold on Eternal life; whereunto thou art called, and hast professed a good profession before many wit∣nesses. Men</HI> ought to regard the presence, the knowledge, the testimony and witness of Men. The <HI>more</HI> Witnesses we promise any thing before, the more we bind our selves to do it. Therefore
<PB N="20" REF="002419_0029_0FDBD18A1FA11B60"/>
our solemn &amp; religious Engagements are required and given in the <HI>sight</HI> of all the people, in the Congregation and Assembly; who are the Lord's witnesses now, and will be so hereafter.</P>
<P>AND so it is with all <HI>private Christians.</HI> What∣ever <HI>Charges</HI> from God, or <HI>Vows</HI> to him you come under, you do it publickly and before many Wit∣nesses. You worship God in <HI>Assemblies,</HI> you <HI>con∣fess Christ before Men,</HI> You are preach'd to in the <HI>great Congregation,</HI> and with them you join in prayer; you Covenant with God publickly; the Assembly saw your <HI>Baptismal Consecration</HI> to God, and they have heard your <HI>good Professions</HI> and Engagements to him: The Solemnities of Zion are all <HI>open</HI> and in the face of the world. The <HI>least person</HI> in the Congregation, that is come under the Covenant of God, stands bound and engaged <HI>in the sight of all Israel,</HI> the Congregation of the Lord and his witnesses: for we are all Wit∣nesses against our selves, and for one another, <HI>That we have chosen the Lord to serve him,</HI> Josh. 24.22.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is in the <HI>Audience of our GOD himself</HI>; which is more than the sight of all <HI>Israel,</HI> that we are charged to keep and seek for his Command∣ments, and have bound our selves to do it. Have <HI>men</HI> seen and heard, much more has <HI>GOD,</HI> Gen. 16.13. <HI>Thou Lord seest me.</HI> He is always and e∣very where present; especially is he so in religious Assemblies and in the more solemn Assemblies of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> We are charged before HIM, <HI>whose eyes run to &amp; fro' thro' the earth, beholding the evil &amp; the good</HI>; before Him <HI>whose eyes behold, his ey-lids try the

Children of men.</HI> We are charged before HIM <HI>who filleth Heaven &amp; Earth with his presence, &amp; from whose presence and Spirit the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is no flying</HI>: before Him <HI>who searches the heart &amp; trys the reins, &amp; will make all the Churches to know that he does so; and will bring every work into judgment with every secret thing.</HI> So we read in the words after my text—, <HI>for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and un∣derstandeth all the Imaginations of the tho'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI></P>
<P>O how <HI>awful</HI> should this consideration be to us? according to what we read, Psal. 139. beg <HI>O Lord, thou hast searched me &amp; known me. Thou knowest my down sitting, and my up-rising; Thou under∣standest my thoughts afar off. Thou compassest my path &amp; my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a Word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether. Thou hast beset me behind &amp; before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is High &amp; I cannot attain unto it. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into Heaven thou art there! if I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there!</HI>—</P>
<P>HOW awful should it be to <HI>Magistrates,</HI> to con∣sider, that they are sworn <HI>before</HI> &amp; <HI>by</HI> the great GOD! and that <HI>He standeth in the Congregation of the mighty; be judgeth among the Gods</HI>; and that he <HI>will arise to judge the Earth, for he shall inherit all Nations,</HI> Psal. 82.</P>
<P>HOW awful should it be to <HI>Ministers</HI> to re∣member their Charge from God, and in his Name and Presence. 1 Tim. 5.21. <HI>I charge thee before
<PB N="22" REF="002419_0031_0FDBD18CC1BF99F0"/>
God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Elect Angels,</HI> 2 Tim. 4.1. <HI>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick &amp; the dead at his appearing and Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>HOW awful should it be to the <HI>Lord's People</HI> to remember the Words we use in receiving their Covenant Engagements and Profession; — <HI>You do as in the presence of the Great GOD profess and promise</HI> —. If we receive the witness of men, <HI>the witness of GOD is greater</HI>: So if the presence of many witnesses on earth is great, how much greater is the <HI>single</HI> eye and notice of God? Josh. 22.22. <HI>The Lord God of Gods, the Lord God of Gods He knoweth; and Israel he shall know.</HI> But how small a thing is <HI>Israels</HI> knowledge, in comparison of <HI>His</HI> who is Israels GOD?</P>
<P>IF it were only a <HI>Stone</HI> that stood by, that has neither eye nor ear nor tongue, yet it were eno' in the presence of GOD. As <HI>Joshua</HI> took a <HI>great Stone</HI> and set it up by the Sanctuary of the Lord, and said unto all the people, <HI>This stone shall be a witness to us; for it has heard all the words of the Lord which he hath spoken to us; it shall be for a witness unto you lest you deny your God.</HI> There needs no witness before <HI>Him</HI>; the very <HI>Stones</HI> shall be witnesses and bear witness for him; if he please <HI>these shall cry out</HI>; and so shall these <HI>Walls</HI> and these <HI>Seats</HI>; and so shall the <HI>Council Board,</HI> the Seats of <HI>Legislation</HI> and those of <HI>Judi∣cature,</HI> for they have heard all <HI>our</HI> Words to God, and <HI>his</HI> to us.</P>
<P>NOW let these <HI>Motives</HI> sink down into our hearts; It is <HI>in the sight of all the Congregation of
<PB N="23" REF="002419_0032_0FDBD19292B8D4D8"/>
the Lord, and in the Audience of your God,</HI> that you are charged and that you promise and profess to keep and seek for all his Commandments.</P>
<P>NOW <HI>Vow and Pay unto the Lord your God: He cuts off t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Princes and is terrible unto the Kings of the Earth.</HI> With Him is <HI>terrible Ma∣jesty.</HI> Let his <HI>Dread</HI> fall on the Greatest and on the least. May the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the Congregation ever cleave to the <HI>Lord,</HI> and this People religiously cleave to Them: According to what we read, Neh. 10.29. <HI>They clave to their Brethren, the Nobl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and enter'd into a Curse and into a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Oath to walk in God's law; and to observe to do all his Commandments, his statutes and his judgments.</HI></P>
<P>I shall conclude this Head with two very dif∣ferent <HI>Reflections</HI>; the one more <HI>pleasant</HI> to make, the other more <HI>melancholy.</HI></P>
<P>ON the one hand it ought to be the Joy of the <HI>Province,</HI> and a matter of special Thanksgiving to GOD in our Churches, that we see <HI>your</HI> HONOUR, (<HI>The Commander in Chief</HI> at this day) stedfastly abiding in the Communion of these <HI>Churches.</HI> God make you always a true <HI>Son</HI> and a kind <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> to them. It is Your Happiness and Ours, that You serve and We enjoy a KING the Equal and righteous <HI>Protector</HI> of his <HI>Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Provinces</HI> in their different <HI>legal</HI> Establishments, for religi∣ous Order, Worship and Discipline. This <HI>Liberty of Conscience</HI> our Fathers sought, and ask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and had a <HI>Royal Charter</HI> to assure them of, and to se∣cure it unto their Children after them. The GOVERNOUR, who is now absent from us, honoured and endear'd Himself to many of us, and very
<PB N="24" REF="002419_0033_0FDBD193787FF188"/>
justly, by his zealous Declarations at all times and in all places, for the Preservation of our Li∣berties both Civil and Religious. And it is yet our Happiness to see almost all our <HI>Councellors</HI> and <HI>Judges</HI> willingly under the <HI>Bonds</HI> of GOD in our <HI>Churches</HI>▪ May He always inspire them with a wise and sincere <HI>Zeal</HI> for His Name &amp; Truths, as they are professed in them. Thanks be to GOD we yet see so much <HI>our Councellors as at the first, and our Judges as at the beginning.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then to pass another, most just but more <HI>melancholy</HI> Reflection:—What <HI>fear &amp; trembling</HI> may well fall upon us, and <HI>what shame &amp; confusion of face</HI> cover us, collectively or personally conside∣red, that we have no more <HI>observed &amp; kept,</HI> that we have perfidiously and presumptuously <HI>broken &amp; transgress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> the Commandments of the Lord our God! <HI>What shall we say after this? that we have forsaken the Lord's Commandments?</HI> after that we have been so bound in his <HI>Audience,</HI> and in the <HI>sight</HI> of all his People! Therefore might he be <HI>justly angry with us and consume us</HI>! therefore shall he be <HI>just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied when he speaks &amp; clear be when he judges!</HI> Therefore do the Confessions and Sup∣plications of <HI>Daniel, Ezra,</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> belong to us! <HI>O my God I am ashamed, and blush to lift up my eyes unto thee my God! O Lord, the Great &amp; dreadful God, keeping the Covenant &amp; Mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his Commandments! We have sinned and have com∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tted Iniquity and have done wickedly, and have rebell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; even in departing from thy Precepts and from thy Judgments! Neither have we hearkned to
<PB N="25" REF="002419_0034_0FDBD1950179EA18"/>
thy servants the Prophets, which spake in thy Name to our Kings, our Princes and our Fathers, and to all the People of the Land! O Lord, Righteous∣ness belongeth unto thee, but unto us Confusion of faces, as at this Day!</HI> —</P>
<P>I go on to the Fourth Observation:</P>
<P>IV. <HI>THAT the Kingdom of Christ, his Church and his Worship among us depends upon our re∣ligious keeping and seeking for all his Command∣ments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now therefore,</HI> says my text; <HI>i. e.</HI> that the <HI>Temple</HI> of God may be built, and his <HI>Worship</HI> setled▪ and the <HI>Throne in the House of David</HI> be continued among you; that the <HI>Kingdom</HI> may have <HI>peace</HI> and that the <HI>House of God</HI> may be more <HI>glorious</HI> than ever; that <HI>Israel</HI> may be blessed by its God both in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> both in it's <HI>Temporal</HI> and <HI>Spiritual</HI> Interests; <HI>keep and seek for the Commandments of the Lord your God.</HI> There can be no <HI>Religion</HI> among a People, nor any <HI>Peace</HI> to them, without this. This matter <HI>first</HI> belongs to Ministers and Magistrates, and <HI>then</HI> to all the people. As they said to <HI>Ezra, We also will be with thee.</HI> Every Order, Rank &amp; Degree among a people must <HI>unite</HI> and agree, be <HI>one</HI> in this thing; every one acting in his place; and we all <HI>need</HI> one another in it. High and low, rich and poor together. What can <HI>inferiour</HI> people do, if the Superior will <HI>not</HI> lead in the fear of God and obe∣dience to him? <HI>If the Foundations are out of course, what can the righteous do?</HI> and what can <HI>Rulers</HI> do without the people? the <HI>Head</HI> walks
<PB N="26" REF="002419_0035_0FDBD1966E719278"/>
and works by the <HI>hands</HI> and <HI>feet.</HI> In a <HI>Building</HI> all hands must set to work: especially if the building be a <HI>Temple</HI> of God, or if it be the re∣pairing it, or cleansing it, or restoring it, it needs <HI>many</HI> hands, it deserves <HI>every</HI> hand. Let not the Religion and Worship of God, his Kingdom and Interest fall thro us, or in our hands. All lies at stake, in our Religion. Wherefore let us rise and act together, with a united force; as <HI>Joab</HI> said bravely to the Men of <HI>Israel</HI> in a day of danger; <HI>when the Battle was against him before &amp; behind</HI>; 2 Sam. 10.12. <HI>Be of good Courage and let us play the men for our people, and for the Cities of our God.</HI> God calls us to bestir our selves in our respective places, according to our different talents, powers, interests, to minister for his Ser∣vice and Glory; for the defence, for the reviving, for the propagating and perpetuating of Religion and his Worship among this People; and he says to us in our places, as <HI>David</HI> did to <HI>Solomon</HI> in his high station, in the 10th and 20th Verses of our <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext; Take heed now, for the Lord calls thee to build his House; be strong and do it: fear not nor be dismayed, for the Lord God, even thy God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee nor forsake thee; and behold the Courses of the priests and Le∣vites even they shall be with thee.</HI></P>
<P>TRULY the Lord our God <HI>is with us if we are with him</HI>; as the <HI>Prophet</HI> of the Lord once said to <HI>Asa</HI> and to all <HI>Judah.</HI> If he give us a heart and spirit to stand by his Truths and Wayes, his Cause and Interests among us, he will stand by us in the support and defence of them; but if we
<PB N="27" REF="002419_0036_0FDBD19A5AF98868"/>
forsake him and these he will forsake us. So has he covenanted and threatned. Wherefore let us <HI>beg of Him</HI> above every thing, a united heart to fear his Name, to love his Ways, and to cleave to∣gether in them. Let us show a zealous adherence to the <HI>Word</HI> and Worship of God. <HI>There</HI> we must seek for the Laws of the Kingdom of Christ, and the Ordinances of his House. <HI>There</HI> our Fathers <HI>sought</HI> them, and have left them to us to <HI>keep</HI>; have left us <HI>to the Law and to the Testimony.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it is time I come to the fifth and last <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which is the other and concluding <HI>Mot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve</HI>:</P>
<P>V. <HI>THIS is the way to keep poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of this good Land which the Lord our God has given us, and to leave it for an Inheritance unto our Chil∣dren after us.</HI></P>
<P>SO says my text; Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the Congregation of the Lord, and in the Audience of our God; keep and seek for all the Commandments of the Lord your God; <HI>that ye may possess this good Land and leave it for an Inheritance for your Children after you, even for ever.</HI> I will only under this Head consider and compare the State of <HI>Israel in Canaan,</HI> and ours in <HI>New-England</HI>; and improve the Dealings and Promises of God to them for our warning.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CANAAN was a good Land, and so is ours.</HI> This Epithet <HI>good</HI> is the common one wherein God was won't to speak of <HI>Canaan.</HI> I suppose there was not at that time a more pleasant and fruitful spot in the whole World. It is described as a Land <HI>flowing with milk and honey: A land of brooks of
<PB N="28" REF="002419_0037_0FDBD19C8DEBD7C0"/>
water, of fountains and depths,</HI> springing not only from the <HI>Vallies</HI> but also from the <HI>Hills: A Land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees &amp; pomegranates, a land of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-olive and honey; a land whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ein bread w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s eat without scarceness, and there was no lack of any thing; a land the stones where∣of were Iron and out of whose Hills they dug brass,</HI> Deut. 8.7, 8, 9. Again, It was a land <HI>that drank w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter of the rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of heaven; a land which the Lord himself cared for, to water it from above; which his eyes were always upon, from the beginning,</HI> &amp;c. 11, 12 Finally, part of it lay on the <HI>Sea,</HI> and it had its <HI>lakes</HI>; and <HI>it suck'd of the abundance of the sea,</HI> it's riches by trade; and of the <HI>treasures hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the sand,</HI> the fish which they drew from the bottom, <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.19. And now you may be ready to think that I have been de∣scribing <HI>our own Country</HI>; which is as likely to be as rich and opulent one as ever the <HI>Land of Ca∣naan</HI> was, if our Sins do not hinder it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD gave Canaan to the Children of Israel, and the same God gave this good Land which we now possess un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o our Fathers.</HI> The <HI>God of Israel</HI> is the One living and true God, and there is no o∣ther but He. He the <HI>God of Abraham</HI> is our God. The knowledge of Him, his Covenant and his Worship is come to us by his Word. He gave the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> by promise unto <HI>Abraham</HI> for his natural Seed by <HI>Isaac</HI>; and with a mighty hand and an out stretched arm he bro't them into it. <HI>They got not the land in possession by their own arm, neither did their own how save them; but his right Hand &amp; his Arm,</HI> Psal. 44. Init▪ He divided the <HI>Sea</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="002419_0038_0FDBD19DEA87A260"/>
before them, he led his people thro' the <HI>Wilder∣ness,</HI> he <HI>smote</HI> great Kings and slew famous Kings, and gave their land for an Heritage, &amp;c. And altho' God has <HI>never</HI> done the like since, or assayed to go and take him a Nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations and signs and won∣ders, by a stretched out arm and great terrors, as he did for the <HI>Children of Israel</HI>; yet the presence of God with our <HI>Fathers,</HI> (a poor scattered and persecuted people, and but a handful that sought rest and a quiet enjoyment of the Gospel) was very remarkable in bringing them into this Land, ma∣king room before them, and driving out the Na∣tions that before possess'd it; whose Good and no hurt to 'em our <HI>Fathers</HI> sought. Indeed we can∣not say, that God gave them a subdued and im∣proved Land for which they did not labour, nei∣ther Cities and houses to dwell in ready built for them, nor Fields &amp; Orchards to eat of which they planted not: But God it was that gave them Wis∣dom and Courage and Strength, a heart to subdue a waste Wilderness, and to fill it with Towns &amp; Villages as it is this Day. They built for God with one hand, and held the Weapons of War in the other, and did bravely, and prosper'd, <HI>for God was with them and fought for them; and gave them rest.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>WE enjoy all the spiritual-Priviledges &amp; Ad∣vantages of the Church of God in Canaan; his House, Worship &amp; Ordinances</HI>; for which it was that God sever'd <HI>Canaan</HI> from the rest of the World, &amp; for which it was that our <HI>Fathers</HI> sought &amp; setled this land. It was <HI>that they might seek and keep all
<PB N="30" REF="002419_0039_0FDBD19F6E7DDEE8"/>
the Commandments and testimonies of the Lord,</HI> and enjoy the pure Worship and Ordinances of the Gospel without molestation, and leave the quiet possession of them to their Children after them. This was their <HI>Errand</HI> hither, and this their <HI>En∣joyment</HI> here, and this their <HI>Legacy</HI> to us. This was the <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> they so't, and this made it a <HI>Canaan</HI> to them; tho' otherwise a dreadful <HI>Wilderness.</HI> For this they left their pleasant <HI>Native Land,</HI> and pass'd the wide and <HI>dangerous Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and planted these Churches of our <HI>Lord Jesus</HI>; wherein the <HI>God of Abraham and Israel is worship'd in spirit &amp; in truth.</HI> So that I may say to you as <HI>Moses</HI> did to <HI>Israel; What people is there that has God nearer to them, or more among them, than this people of New-England? or what Nation have statutes and judgments more righteous, or the Ordinances of God more pure, and a more spiritual Worship than this people</HI>? What people have the <HI>Lord's Sabbath</HI>▪ &amp; <HI>Co∣venant</HI> more shewn to them? or the <HI>good knowledge of the Lord</HI> more and better taught among them? We have the <HI>Ark</HI> and <HI>Sanctuary</HI> of God with us as much as ever it was in <HI>Canaan.</HI> Wherefore <HI>blessed of the Lord is our Land,</HI> not only for the <HI>precious dews of Heaven over</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and for the <HI>deep that coucheth beneath</HI>; but more especially for the knowledge and <HI>Good will of him that dwelt in the Bush</HI>: He gave his word to <HI>Jacob,</HI> his Statutes and Judgments to <HI>Israel,</HI> he has not done so by every People.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>IT is &amp; should be our care to keep possession of this good Land, and of these spiritual &amp; invaluable Privi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eges which the Lord our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has given us.</HI> Na∣ture &amp; Grace do both teach it.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="31" REF="002419_0040_0FDBD1A0EDF87A78"/>1. <HI>AS to the Soil &amp; Land it self.</HI> GOD has given it to <HI>our Fathers</HI> and we ought valiantly, and diligently to defend it from Enemies. Our fathers got it in possession by the special Provi∣dence of God: <HI>Not by their own arm &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that could not have sav'd them from the surrounding <HI>Salvages</HI>; but it was God's right hand did it, be∣cause he had a favour to them; and a purpose of glory to his Name in these Churches, in these ends of the earth. Now as <HI>Jephthay</HI> said unto the Messengers of the King of the Children of <HI>Ammon,</HI> when he sent to challenge a part of the Land of <HI>Israel</HI>; Judges, 11.23, 24. <HI>Now the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people, shouldest thou possess it? — Whomsoever the Lord our G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d shall drive out before us them will we possess.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> all along behind us do so; and I wish there were not reason to call them, as there is, the <HI>Natural Enemies</HI> of our Provinces and of our Religion. Our <HI>Salvages to the East</HI> are poison'd by them, and us'd by them as bloody In∣struments of <HI>War</HI> upon us. They would drive us, if they could <HI>off</HI> the Land, into the Sea. They distress and straiten, weaken and diminish us in our <HI>Borders</HI>; as the <HI>Remnants of the Canaanites</HI> did sinful <HI>Israel</HI> from time to time; and they are like to be a dreadful Scourge unto our <HI>Children</HI> after us. We must therefore <HI>fight the Lord</HI>'s <HI>Battles,</HI> by his help, and defend the <HI>Soil</HI>; and in fighting for <HI>that</HI> we also do for the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Altar</HI> of God among us.— For,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WE have our Civil &amp; Religious Liberties also</HI> which are the <HI>glory</HI> of the Land, to defend &amp; secure
<PB N="32" REF="002419_0041_0FDBD1A5AD73E510"/>
as far as we are able. I am sorry there should be any among us, I would hope there can be none <HI>of us,</HI> who bear with grief or ill-will <HI>our spi∣ritual or Charter Privileges.</HI> Our <HI>Fathers</HI> dearly deserv'd &amp; purchas'd them, by their Estates and by their Lives spent in this Service to <HI>Christ</HI> and to their <HI>King</HI>; the subduing this Wilderness and the planting these Churches at their own cost. The <HI>Government</HI> that then was, the <HI>King</HI> &amp; his <HI>Wise Council,</HI> justly tho't so, and gave the humble <HI>Privileges</HI> which they modestly asked for. None therefore ought to envy to their <HI>Posterity</HI> what they enjoy and value; without any breach upon the Rights &amp; Liberties of others. <HI>They</HI> that chuse to come and live among us for their own worldly advantage, ought willingly to leave us in the quiet Possession of the dear Purchase of our Fathers, or of <HI>the Royal Favour &amp; Bounty to them.</HI> At least <HI>we</HI> owe this Duty to God, to our Fami∣lies and to our Children after us, to endeavour by all just and righteous ways to keep possession of our Priviledges, both spiritual &amp; religious—.</P>
<P>I add therefore,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>IT should be our earnest desire &amp; prayer, our diligent care and endeavour, to leave this good Land, under it's present priviledges Civil &amp; Re∣ligious, unto our Children after us, for an Inheri∣tance, even for ever.</HI> We can possess it but for a little while. Our Fathers, <HI>where are are they</HI>? and our <HI>Ministers</HI> that were before us? They are gone and we are going after them to the grave! O might it be to Heaven the <HI>Celestial Ca∣naan,</HI> where many of them are! We are <HI>enter'd
<PB N="33" REF="002419_0042_0FDBD1A7C0E2D268"/>
into their labours</HI>: They wro't for us: We must work for our Posterity, and the Glory of God a∣mong them. <HI>Our Priviledges</HI> were dear to our Fathers; these they left us; and counted that they left us a <HI>goodly heritage.</HI> This let us leave to and desire to see <HI>entailed on</HI> our Children after us. Let this be our desire, that these Churches and the Worship of God in them may be enjoy'd by posterity; and that the rising Generation may know &amp; fear, and serve the Lord God of their Fathers; <HI>may seek and keep all his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD only can defend and secure to us our Land, our Churches; our civil &amp; religious Rights</HI> He <HI>gave</HI> them to us; <HI>in whose hand the hearts▪ of Kings are.</HI> As <HI>Nehemiah</HI> teaches us to give God the glory; Neh. 2.8. <HI>The king granted me Letters according to the good hand of God upon me.</HI> In his hand too are the hearts of <HI>Enemies,</HI> and he can <HI>turn</HI> them; and can chain them up, and de∣feat their Counsels. We may and we should look to the God of Heaven as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did, and pray to him and trust in him: Neh. 1.10, 11. <HI>Now these are thy servants &amp; thy people; O Lord I be∣seech thee let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servants, that desire to fear thy name; &amp; prosper and grant them mercy.</HI> Some may laugh us to scorn for these words, as some did them, <HI>Neh</HI> 2.19. But would we seek now and keep the Commandments of the Lord our God as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did, we might answer with his words, —<HI>The God of heaven he will pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sper us, therefore we his servants will arise &amp; build.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="34" REF="002419_0043_0FDBD1AA487661C0"/>2. LET it be seriously remembred, considered, realized &amp; believed by us, that <HI>God has promis'd his people to defend them in the possession of their Land and of their Religion, and to leave it unto their Children after them</HI>; if they will keep the Charge of the Lord, and seek for and keep all his Commandments. The safety of God's people is in his Name &amp; Promise; and this has been his Promise. Deut. 4.1, 40. <HI>Now therefore hearken to the Statutes &amp; Judgments of God to do them, that you may live and possess the Land; and that it may go well with thee and with thy Children after thee; and that you may prolong your dayes.</HI> This <HI>Promise,</HI> or if you will this <HI>Motive</HI> to Obedience, is often repeated and urged by the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI>; Deut. 12.28. <HI>Observe &amp; hear all these Words, which I command thee, that it may go well with thee and with thy Children after thee for ever; when thou doest that which is good &amp; right in the sight of the Lord thy God.</HI> To give the utmost force unto this Promise God has confirm'd it to his people with an <HI>Oath</HI>; Deut. 28.1, 9. <HI>If thou shalt diligently hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe &amp; do all his Commandments,</HI> —then <HI>the Lord shall establish thee an holy Peo∣ple unto himself as he hath</HI> SWORN <HI>unto thee.</HI> A∣gain, the Promise is, Lev. 26.11, 12. <HI>If ye walk in my statutes and keep my Commandments, I will set up my Tabernacle among you, and my soul shall not abhor you; and I will walk among you &amp; be your God, and ye shall be my people.</HI> These are the <HI>Prom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses</HI> of God to his People, and his <HI>Covenant</HI> with their Children after them, if they

<P N="3">3.

They are put together in the Word of God and we must not separate them. Deut. 30.15, —20. <HI>See I have set before you this day, life &amp; good, death &amp; evil, In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that thou mayest live &amp; multiply, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee—: But if thine heart turn away, so that thou will not hear, — I denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your dayes upon the Land.</HI> The like Threatning we have, Deut. 4.26. <HI>I call Heaven &amp; Earth to witness, that ye shall utterly perish from off the Land; ye shall not prolong your dayes upon it, but shall utterly be de∣stroyed; and the Lord shall scatter you among the Heathen.</HI> Heaven &amp; Earth have seen these <HI>Threat∣nings</HI> fulfilled on the People of God; particularly on the <HI>Jewish Nation.</HI> And <HI>these things h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pned

Deut. 29.25, — 29. <HI>They forsook the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fathers,— and the anger of the Lord was kindled against their Land, to bring upon it all the Curses that are wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten in his Book: And the Lord r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oted them out in Anger, and in Wrath, and in great Indig∣nation, and cast them into another Land, as it is this Day. The secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but those things which are revealed unto us, and to our Children for ever; that we may do all the words of this Law.</HI></P>
<P>AS therefore we value our <HI>Earthly Inheritance,</HI> &amp; would leave it to our Children after us; or as we value our <HI>Spiritual Priviledges</HI> &amp; desire that these may continue with them; &amp; yet most of all, as we would be seeking a <HI>better Country,</HI> that is the <HI>Heavenly Canaan,</HI> for our selves and Ours; let us receive the <HI>Exhortation</HI> now bro't to us in the Name of GOD, — <HI>O seek for &amp; keep all the Commandments of the Lord your GOD.</HI></P>
<P>LET me plead with you from the Love we owe to <HI>GOD,</HI> our <HI>Selves,</HI> our <HI>Children,</HI> &amp; our <HI>Country.</HI> If we have any Concern for His glory from us &amp; ours; if we regard our own and their Welfare, Temporal, Spiritual &amp; Eternal; if we seek the Good of others, as well those that are living with us, as theirs who shall come after us; Let us be observant of the Divine Will and Law, made known to us for our Good; <HI>and teach it di∣ligently to our Children.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="002419_0046_0FDBD13A2A11AB28"/>DO this in Obedience, Gratitude, Fidelity to GOD, that your Children may know &amp; love and serve Him, &amp; be to Him for a Name a praise &amp; a glory. Deut. 4.9. <HI>Only take heed to thy self, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, &amp; lest they depart from thy heart all the dayes of thy life, but teach them thy sons &amp; thy sons sons.</HI> Deut. 31.13. <HI>And that your Children, which have not known any thing, may hear &amp; learn to fear the Lord your God.</HI> After our selves, <HI>our Children</HI> are the best and greatest things which we have to render unto God: They are <HI>living &amp; spiritual Sacrifices</HI> like our own souls; a <HI>reasonab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Service, holy &amp; acceptable thro Christ.</HI> They belong to GOD by Covenant as well as we, &amp; we must <HI>shew</HI> them his Covenant, and do our best to <HI>Establish</HI> them in it; that we may leave them as well under the <HI>Blessings,</HI> as the <HI>Bonds</HI> of it.</P>
<P>LET us do our part (&amp; surely we have a <HI>part</HI> to do, one &amp; other of us in our places) that Religion may not <HI>die</HI> with us or rather before us; but that it may survive with ours after us, &amp; outlive them, &amp; flourish more yet in their times who are not yet born.

He had the happy prospect of <HI>this</HI>; that the <HI>Name</HI> of God in <HI>Israel</HI> was like to be still <HI>greater,</HI> and the <HI>Worship</HI> of God more <HI>Solemn</HI> &amp; glorious in his

<HI>Sons</HI> days than it had been in his. This abiding and <HI>increasing Glory</HI> of God, in the Church, thro' his means, after his Decease, was <HI>David's Crown</HI> in Death; and a brighter <HI>Diadem</HI> it set before him than that earthly one which he was laying down.</P>
<P>YOU know not what Services you are doing to God and men, while you are Educating your Children religiously. They will (you hope) teach their Children, and they theirs, the Word of God, down to many Generations. This is the Spirit of all the Faithful, Psal. 78.4. <HI>We will not hide them from their Children, shewing to the Generation to come the Praises of the Lord, and his Strength, and his wonderful Works that he hath done; That the Generation to come may know them, even the Children that shall be born, who shall arise &amp; declare them to their Children.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR Children also may come into those places of Trust, and publick Service, which you little think of, and be of great use in the World; for which you should be now furnishing them, according to the Grace of God given to you. One instructed Child may be an accomplish'd Instru∣ment of unknown Good to many, whether he serve in the State or in the Church. So <HI>Jacob</HI> taught <HI>Joseph</HI> the fear of God, and God carry'd him to the Government of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> to save all the <HI>Countries</HI> round about and <HI>the Church that was in his Fathers house.</HI> So the Parents of <HI>Moses</HI> privately taught him the Religion of God, &amp; laid the foundation of all the great Services which he did for God and his People. He is a <HI>Benefactor</HI> to the World, who educates his Children laudably

<P>BUT if we neglect our Children, we not only <HI>rob God</HI> &amp; his Church of them▪ but as it were <HI>Sacrifice them to Moloch.</HI> So <HI>impious</HI> are we to God, &amp; <HI>barbarous</HI> to them. Besides the present <HI>Injury</HI> to the world from us, the <HI>Misery</HI> will be to our selves &amp; ours in the <HI>Day of Judgment.</HI> We shall be found as guilty in that day, as if we had literally built <HI>the High places of Tophet, in the vally of the son of Hinnon, to burn our sons and daughters in the fire,</HI> Jer. 7.31. We shall ly open to that dreadful <HI>Charge,</HI> Ezek. 16.20, 21. <HI>Thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters which thou hast born unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed to be devoured: Is this of thy Whoredoms a small mat∣ter? that thou hast slain my Children</HI> — I leave it to your <HI>Bowels</HI> to make answer unto such a Challenge.</P>
<P>MIND how <HI>Ezra</HI>'s love to God wro't? and the love of the <HI>pious Jews</HI> with him to their Pos∣terity; Ezra 8.21. <HI>Then I proclaimed a Fast to afflict our selves before our God, and to seek of him a right Way for us &amp; for our little ones: So we fasted &amp; besought our God for this, and he was entreated of us.</HI> This was as those that lov'd God and their Country, desirous that their Children should be happy in the knowledge of God and of his wayes. God <HI>seeks this godly seed</HI> too and their <HI>Prosperity</HI>: Deut. 5.29. <HI>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me and keep my Commandments always; that it might be well with them and with their Children for ever.</HI></P>
