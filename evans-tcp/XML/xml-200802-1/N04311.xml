<P><SEG REND="decorInit">'T</SEG>IS the just observation of the contemplative <HI>Psalmist,</HI> that the heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firmament sheweth his handy-work; and that the earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof, he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods. Now if GOD had wisdom to contrive, and power to effect these beautiful globes, he has an indisputable right to
<PB N="6" REF="005326_0005_1016FF6BC9A30698"/>
the government of them, and is certainly qualified for it: Nor may it be thought, that it does not com∣port with his majesty, or is an obstruction to his quiet and happiness to concern himself in the government of the world. The notion of <HI>Lucretius</HI> is contradic∣tory to that idea of the divine being, the oracles of truth furnish us with. To suppose, that, when he had made the world, he took no further thought or care, but left it to shift for itself, implies one or other of these absurdities, that he either made it for no wise design, or through some mistake in its formation it did not answer his original purpose; like an unskilful artificer, not having framed his work according to the model of it in his own mind, throws it by, and does not care what becomes of it: But as it is a most wise production, that has no blotches or blunders in it, but in all its parts exquisitely done, and every way correspondent to the design in the eternal mind, there can be no reason upon this account why he should not govern it. And then, as he is a most wise agent, and all his works the effects of counsel, and conse∣quently had some wise design in making it, 'tis abso∣lutely necessary for him to govern it, in order to ac∣complish that design; and how can he act more like himself, and display the glory of his perfections better, than by preserving the several ranks of beings, in that harmonious and admirable order they were placed in at first? or why should it be thought below his dig∣nity to regard the works of his own hands? or can it be any difficulty to an omniscient and omnipotent being to attend such a number of things as the govern∣ment of the world includes? To imagine this is to
<PB N="7" REF="005326_0006_1016FF6D5A741458"/>
limit the most high, debase his excellencies, and bring him down upon a level with his creatures, and to think that because we find our minds and powers so narrow and limited, that a small number of objects bound our thoughts and cares, therefore the inspec∣tion of so many must be a burden to GOD himself. It becomes us better to confess and adore with the <HI>psalmist,</HI> than to object against providence, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>reigneth, he is clothed with majesty.—he is the king of all the earth.</HI> But then, as to the <HI>form</HI> of that govern∣ment which he exercises, it is a subject so sublime and mysterious that we can say but little of it; and therefore having asserted that <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>reigns,</HI> he presently adds, that <HI>clouds and darkness are round about him. His way is in the sea, his path in the mighty waters, and his footsteps are not known.</HI> But tho', the <HI>arcana imperii</HI> are an height we can't reach, a depth we can't fathom, yet we must think there is a great deal of reason and righteousness in them; and that a most beautiful scene would open to us, if we were let into all the secret springs of the divine government, and could trace the various steps and gradation by which every design in accomplished.</P>
<P>Good men, in all ages, have been so well satisfied with the wisdom, goodness and equity of providence, that they have acquiesced in it, <HI>rejoiced in tribulation,</HI> triumphed when surrounded with greatest dangers, and thick and black clouds have impended over the church or state, and threatned its subversion.</P>
<P>It is from our professed belief of his all-disposing providence, and just sense of our absolute dependance upon it, and of our duty to <HI>acknowledge GOD in all
<PB N="8" REF="005326_0007_1016FF70303E3840"/>
our ways,</HI> and implore his direction in an affair of the highest importance, and wherein the interest of the province, both civil and religious, is so nearly con∣cerned, that we are now assembled in this house of worship.</P>
<P>Thanks be to the LORD upon the <HI>throne,</HI> that our <HI>civil liberties</HI> granted by the ROYAL CHARTER are continued, under the auspicious reign of king GEORGE the IId; and that this day is again revolved upon us, wherein the <HI>heads of our tribes,</HI> are met together to select and constitute, by the consent of the <HI>governour,</HI> one main branch of our <HI>legislature.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas your <HI>Excellency</HI> and the <HI>honourable Board</HI> have called me, however unworthy, to declare the counsels of heaven to you, upon this occasion; <HI>stirring up your pure minds, by way of remembrance,</HI> I desire to speak with humility and fear, as becomes the oracles of GOD, and with fidelity to my great LORD and MASTER, knowing that I must give an account.</P>
<P>When the angel of the LORD appeared unto <HI>Moses</HI> in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a Bush, he said, <HI>I will now turn aside, and see this great sight;</HI> so let us all now turn aside, for a while, and lift up our eyes above the hills, above the firmament, and behold with the wondring <HI>prophet</HI> the LORD <HI>sitting upon a throne high and lifted up.</HI></P>
<P>The prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> was of noble birth, of the royal family, and <HI>nephew</HI> to king <HI>Uzziah</HI> he here speaks of, as the <HI>Jews</HI> relate. And he was of a <HI>noble spirit,</HI> and not exceeeded by any that prophesied be∣fore, or after him in clearness and abundance of
<PB N="9" REF="005326_0008_1016FF731276F1A8"/>
visions, and revelations, especially concerning the MESSIAH; and in a curious and polite, lofty and majestick stile.</P>
<P>The first words of my text spread a melancholy gloom upon the face of rulers. <HI>In the year that king</HI> Uzziah <HI>died.</HI> Tho' a <HI>great</HI> man in <HI>Israel,</HI> and a <HI>good</HI> man, yet <HI>he died.</HI> Neither grace nor grandure can exempt from death. Princes, who are in a qua∣lified sense the <HI>breath of a people's nostrils,</HI> derive their breath from GOD; and when it pleases him, the so∣vereign arbiter of life, <HI>their breath goes forth, they re∣turn to the earth, and in that very day their thoughts perish.</HI> Whatever distinction GOD, in his providence, has made betwixt one man and another, in civil respects, they are all in death's account equal. King <HI>Uzziah'</HI>s reign was long and prosperous, and <HI>Judah</HI> was happy under it; but he must not live always: It is the prerogative of him, whom the <HI>prophet saw upon the throne,</HI> to be the KING ETERNAL.</P>
<P>It was in the year of this king's death, that <HI>Isaiah</HI> had his vision. GOD, <HI>at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets;</HI> sometimes by dreams, sometimes by a audible voice, and sometimes by visions, as here to <HI>Isaiah,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Ezekiel</HI> by the river <HI>Chebar.</HI> It is not to be supposed, that the eyes of the <HI>prophet</HI> were so strengthned by a supernatural power, as that he saw into the third heaven, at so vast a distance; but he had a representation of the light &amp; glory of it, conveyed to his mind by some sensible images, and of the LORD <HI>sitting upon a throne</HI> there, not like king <HI>Solomon'</HI>s, a <HI>throne of ivory, and overlaid with the
<PB N="10" REF="005326_0009_1016FF75F3A4F668"/>
purest gold,</HI> but a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezekiel</HI> i. 26.</NOTE> <HI>saphire throne,</HI> transcendently bright and glorious, above all competition or controul, and commanding over all other thrones.</P>
<P>There are several important articles which might come under our consideration here, as the heads of my present discourse:</P>
<P>As,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>The</HI> person <HI>whom the prophet saw thus exalted and dignified.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The import <HI>of his advancement, or the ideas it serves to convey to us.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>His</HI> qualifications <HI>for his exalted station.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. <HI>The</HI> extent <HI>of his dominion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>V. <HI>The</HI> nature <HI>and</HI> form <HI>of his administration,</HI> &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But I must confine myself to the two first of these heads.</P>
<P>I. Then, <HI>I am to consider</HI> who <HI>it is that the</HI> prophet <HI>saw upon the throne.</HI></P>
<P>It could not be any <HI>meer</HI> man, or an <HI>angel,</HI> assum∣ing a human form. It is the place of the angelical orders to stand about the throne, and minister unto it; and this is honour enough for them. It was a <HI>divine person,</HI> the SON OF GOD, the <HI>root</HI> and the <HI>offspring of David,</HI> the <HI>bright</HI> and <HI>morning star.</HI> Some think it was the <HI>first</HI> of the divine persons who was exhibited to the prophet, and that we read of a like appearance of his, Dan. vii. 9. <HI>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure woo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> burning fire,</HI> &amp;c. But I rather think
<PB N="11" REF="005326_0010_1016FF7923234CE0"/>
this to be understood of CHRIST, who is called the <HI>ancient of days,</HI> because of his immutable and eternal <HI>divinity,</HI> and that it is a mistake to assert that the FATHER, or the HOLY GHOST ever appeared in such a low and diminutive form; but the SON often oc∣casionally did so, for he was to be incarnate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his glory, and dwell among us. Thus he appeared to <HI>Abraham;</HI> and in the same shape, upon the burning mount, at the giving of the law; and, in the like manner to <HI>Isaiah;</HI> for so the vision is explained, John 12. 41. <HI>These things said</HI> Isaiah, <HI>when he saw his glory and spake of him:</HI> All which appearances were undoubtedly designed to prefigure his assumption of the nature of man, and its subsequent advancement to the throne of GOD, the authority of a prince and a judge there.</P>
<P>Whether he assumed the form of that individual body he appeared in afterwards, is an inquiry more <HI>speculative</HI> than <HI>practical.</HI></P>
<P>To set upon the throne of his FATHER was the glory he had with him before all worlds, and which he had a <HI>natural</HI> right to: And it is also the glory the FATHER promised him as the reward of our Redemption, Isaiah liii. 12. <HI>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he hath poured out his soul unto death.</HI>—Psalm xvi. II. <HI>Thou wilt shew me the path of life, in thy presence is fulness of joy, at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.</HI> In the prospect of this recompence he engaged, suffered the cross, and despised the shame, and is now thus <HI>highly exalted above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet.</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005326_0011_1016FF7C4C5D7378"/>
The apostle <HI>John</HI> long since beheld him in the same place and posture, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5. 1. with all the shining myriads about him, and praising of him.</P>
<P>It is then an <HI>exalted</HI> JESUS the prophet saw, and I am now speaking of. <HI>He that was made lower than the angels, is now crowned with glory and honour.</HI> And such an high priest the christian has, <HI>who is set down on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens.</HI> I hope you will all hear the report with pleasure. I am sure, if thro' grace we arrive at the vision that comes after, it will never tire us. CHRIST upon the throne is the attractive object of every eye, and engages every heart, angels behold and wonder, and saints adore the risen GOD: His throne is guarded with legions of blessed spirits, who with united voices proclaim his excellencies and shout his praises. They did not disdain to sing his birth to humble shepherds, and now with joy celebrate the glories of his exalta∣tion. And the redeemed and perfected spirits unite in the consort, Rev. 19. beg. <HI>I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluja,—for the LORD GOD omnipotent reigneth.</HI> Thus the saints are joyful in glory, the children of Zion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> joyful in their king, they sing with loud <HI>Hosannah'</HI>s to the son of <HI>David,</HI> the vaults of heaven eccho with songs of praise, and the triumph shall never end: <HI>Blessed are they that dwell in thy courts, they will be still praising thee.</HI> Thus the LORD JESUS CHRIST, the eternal SON of GOD, from a low and humble state on earth, is advanced ro the highest seat of dignity, and sus∣tains a post of the utmost grandure in the heavenly world: He sets upon a throne of majesty, that com∣mands reverence and honour from us who are now worshipping at his feet, and from all intelligent beings.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005326_0012_1016FF7F397219B8"/>
He sets upon a throne of grace, to which we may may come boldly. The consideration of his majesty might make us afraid to draw near and speak to him: This effect it had upon the <HI>prophet,</HI> when he beheld the glory of the LORD, <HI>Then, said I, wo is me, I am undone:</HI> But he is exalted upon a <HI>mercy-seat,</HI> with a rainbow (an emblem of mercy) about his head: This <HI>invites</HI> the sinner to him, <HI>even to his seat,</HI> to lay open his wants, complain of his grievances, and im∣plore his compassion and help. He sets upon a throne of GRACE to give out <HI>pardons</HI> to humble supplicants, and communicate <HI>blessings</HI> to the poor and needy; and he is as ready to give as we can be to ask them.</P>
<P>He sets upon a throne of <HI>government,</HI> giving out his laws, and demanding our obedience, and observ∣ing what regards we pay to them, that he may re∣ward, or punish us accordingly: For the throne of <HI>judgment</HI> is also his; and at his word we either stand or fall.</P>
<P>Having thus spoken of the <HI>person,</HI> the prophet saw upon the throne of glory, high and lifted up:</P>
<P>I proceed to consider,</P>
<P>II. <HI>The</HI> import <HI>of the</HI> vision, <HI>or the</HI> ideas <HI>it serves to convey to us.</HI> And it certainly includes all that is <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good.</HI> The subject is truly <HI>sublime,</HI> and full of <HI>mystery,</HI> and we may never expect to comprehend it while in our present state of imperfection, but the advantages of it to us, are surprisingly great and various.</P>
<P>CHRIST <HI>upon the throne</HI> in our nature, what can be more delightful to hear and contemplate? And how great and boundless the expectations it raises in us? He is now ready to all acts of care about his people,
<PB N="14" REF="005326_0013_1016FF821A5B3910"/>
they are ever under his eye, and within reach of his arm; he is a <HI>sun</HI> to <HI>enlighten,</HI> a <HI>shield</HI> to <HI>defend,</HI> and a <HI>fountain</HI> to <HI>supply</HI> them: What more is needful to encourage the active christian, to revive the droop∣ing saint, or to astonish the daring sinner? CHRIST'S advancement is the believer's assurance, that he shall live and reign with him in that blessed world, where <HI>they shall hunger no more, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat; for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and GOD shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</HI></P>
<P>To be particular here,</P>
<P N="1">1. This exaltation of CHRIST speaks the <HI>transcen∣dant dignity</HI> and <HI>excellency</HI> of his <HI>person,</HI> that he is worthy of the throne he sets on, and qualified for all the great designs of his advancement. It would be a dishonour to the wisdom of GOD to place him there, if he was a mean person, or an insufficient ruler: It speaks his <HI>joint-interest</HI> in the FATHER, the <HI>eternal head</HI> of government, and <HI>oneness</HI> with him in <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>glory:</HI> For GOD never did, or will receive any other into the throne, to share the dignities and pre∣rogatives of it: To <HI>which of the angels said he at any time, set thou at my right hand?</HI> Nothing like it was ever spoken to any of <HI>them.</HI> They are the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>purest</HI> productions of divine light, above man in his original state of integrity and perfection; but infinite <HI>descents</HI> below the SON of GOD, and pay their <HI>joint homage</HI> to him in the lowest postures of humility and reverence. Their wisdom is folly; their power, weakness; and their holiness, impurity, compared with his. This vast disproportion they themselves do readily acknowledge, and are ashamed and blush at
<PB N="15" REF="005326_0014_1016FF854862AEC8"/>
the <HI>stupidity</HI> of some men, in debasing <HI>him</HI> almost to a <HI>level</HI> with <HI>themselves:</HI> The excellency of CHRIST infinitely transcends all <HI>angelical</HI> perfection; some faint rays of this glory were visible to his disciples, <HI>Thro' his veil of flesh: We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the</HI> FATHER,—John i. 14. But how little of it appeared to them, in respect of what the <HI>prophet</HI> saw, when HE was <HI>sitting upon his throne,</HI> with all the coelestial inhabitants about him, and spark∣ling in all the bright rays of the FATHER'S <HI>glory,</HI> and <HI>his own.</HI> The prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> had a like vision of him, cloathed with robes of dazzling light. But af∣ter all, we may not suppose that the <HI>fulness of glory</HI> was visible to either of them: It was not the splendor of <HI>unveiled</HI> majesty, but the <HI>likeness of his glory;</HI> the <HI>fulness</HI> of it, is <HI>light inaccessible</HI> and cannot be viewed by mortal eyes. Glorified spirits have much brighter visions of him. The soul in its exalted state shall <HI>see the king in his beauty,</HI> all the perfections of that in∣finitely great and glorious nature in their brightness and purity, the effect whereof will be the highest ad∣miration, ardent love, and an eternal spring of uni∣versal praise.</P>
<P N="2">2. It speaks the <HI>utmost grandeur.</HI> To ascend a throne is the <HI>very top of preferment;</HI> flesh and blood can rise no higher: The most aspiring tempers do but aim at this, and have no notion of a superiour ad∣vancement; and it is but here and there one, that can grasp the <HI>royal dignity.</HI> This honour was con∣ferred upon CHRIST at his <HI>ascention,</HI> according to the prediction, Psal. 47. 5. <HI>GOD is gone up with a shout; the</HI> LORD <HI>with the sound of a trumpet; sing praises to GOD; sing praises to our king, for he is the king of
<PB N="16" REF="005326_0015_1016FF884335D2B8"/>
all the earth: The</HI> LORD <HI>reigneth over the heathen, he sitteth upon the throne of his holiness, the shields of the earth belong unto him, he is greatly exalted.</HI> He pro∣mised but little grandeur when he was stretched upon a cross, the sport of men, and the mark of violence. Man thought the meanest honour too much for him, but in GOD's esteem all the glory of heaven was not too great: When he was arraigned at the bar, he in∣timated that he should by and by ascend a throne, and head an empire comprehending both heaven and earth, and they <HI>should hereafter see him coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory, attended with all the holy angels,</HI> to take vengeance upon his enemies: They entertain'd the report, (as we may imagine) with a <HI>disdainful</HI> smile; thinking it no bet∣ter than the wilds of <HI>enthusiasm,</HI> for so mean a person to challenge so exalted honours: He was born in a stable, begun his life with brutes, and ended it with malefactors; but now is the LORD of hosts, principa∣lities and powers: oh surprising change, and beyond all imagination to them by <HI>whose wicked hands he was crucified and slain! here</HI> he was despised of men; <HI>there</HI> he is adored by angels: <HI>here</HI> in contempt and mock∣ery he was crowned with thorns; but <HI>now</HI> he wears the crown of glory: <HI>here</HI> he was nailed to a cross; but <HI>there</HI> he sets upon a throne high and lifted up: <HI>here</HI> he groaned under the weight of sin and the curse; <HI>there</HI> he triumphs: <HI>here</HI> he had no form or comeliness; but <HI>now</HI> he shines in all the beauties and glories of the god-head, and has the most profound respect and veneration paid him by the infinite num∣bers about him.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="17" REF="005326_0016_1016FF8B199A6D98"/>
3. It assures us of the <HI>accomplishment of our re∣demption,</HI> The FATHER that chose him to this work, knew him equal to it, He did not lay the help of his perishing creature upon a broken reed, but <HI>upon one that was mighty.</HI> The burden was too heavy for an angel's shoulders, but the SON was able to bear it, he could both fulfil the <HI>precept</HI> and suffer the <HI>penalty</HI> of the violated law; and so discharge the debt we owed to inflexible justice. The FATHER, by an audible voice from the excellent glory, testified his acceptance of what he had done: And the SON appeals to him, when leaving the world, that he had glorified him on the earth, and finished the work he had given him to do; and, according to the eternal compact between them, supplicates for that glory he enjoyed before the world was, which was as readily given him, as it was asked for, as the <HI>psalmist</HI> by spirit of prophecy declares, <HI>I have set my king up∣on my holy hill of Zion,</HI> Psal. ii. 6. He raised him from the dishonours of the grave, and placed him at his own right hand; and the grandeur he now pos∣sesses, is an incontestible evidence, as of the <HI>dignity</HI> of his <HI>person,</HI> so of the <HI>sufficiency</HI> of his <HI>sacrifice;</HI> for if he had not accomplished the work he engaged in, but it had come imperfect from his hand, he had not been thus advanced, but left eternally under the power of death. His resurrection assures us, that the <HI>whole debt</HI> was paid, the thundering law silenced, and the justice of GOD has no further demands to make upon us. We have nothing to do now in <HI>way of satisfaction;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our whole work is to <HI>believe in, adore</HI> and <HI>love</HI> a once <HI>crucified,</HI> but now <HI>enthroned</HI> JESUS.

And how numerous, how rich and comprehensive are the blessings conveyed down to us, from the fountain of love and mercy, by his means? And how much greater those we are the joyful expectants of? What is it that GOD <HI>reconciled</HI> is not willing to do for us? If we miss of pardon and grace here, salvation and glory hereafter, it is our own fault. The <HI>apostle'</HI>s argument is strong and convincing, that seeing <HI>GOD spared not his own</HI> SON, <HI>but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him freely give us all things?</HI> Rom. viii. 32.</P>

A Throne is the most <HI>publick</HI> station, and the person upon it affords an ad∣vantage for a <HI>general</HI> notice; no one is debarred from vision, but <HI>every eye sees him.</HI> Here the believer has sometimes a <HI>glimpse</HI> of his glory, and his love thro' the thick medium of ordinances; but this is <HI>personal</HI> and <HI>secret:</HI> but <HI>there</HI> he exhibits himself to all at once; they behold with <HI>open face</HI> the <HI>glory of the</HI> LORD; and as the sun sometimes forms its likeness in a cloud, so they are <HI>transformed into the same image, from glory to glory.</HI> There's no need of any artifice, of taking the advantage of rising ground, or of climb∣ing the <HI>sycamore-tree</HI> to behold him, for he is not hid in a throng, nor is the vision transient, but he is fixed upon a throne, and always to be seen. And with what pleasure and admiration do they behold him? The company of <HI>prophets</HI> and <HI>apostles,</HI> the noble <HI>army</HI> of <HI>martyrs,</HI> the <HI>general assembly</HI> of <HI>believers</HI> and <HI>church of the first-born,</HI> will afford an additional

joy; but it is JESUS <HI>the mediator</HI> that fills the soul with delight and satisfaction, and is infinitely more to it than all heaven besides. It is the <HI>favour</HI> he demands for all his redeemed, that <HI>they may be where he is, to behold his glory:</HI> And this is the believers ardent wish, and perpetual <HI>desire;</HI> and the grant of it is sure.

<P N="5">5. And I know come to what I chiefly design. It denotes his actual government <HI>over all things.</HI> A Throne speaks <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>authority:</HI> and <HI>all power is his both in heaven and on earth. The Government of the world is upon his shoulder;</HI> and <HI>his name wonderful, councellour, the mighty GOD, the everlasting Father, the prince of peace, of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end; upon the throne of</HI> David, <HI>and upon his kingdom, to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever:</HI> These are some of the magnificent and lofty expressions of the holy men of GOD concerning the <HI>dominion</HI> of CHRIST, speaking <HI>as they were moved by the</HI> HOLY GHOST; and after this pompous manner the <HI>prophets</HI> have all along described the <HI>glories</HI> of his Kingdom.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>heathen</HI> confined the dominion of GOD to the <HI>supreme</HI> heavens, over the <HI>angelical</HI> orders, and would not allow that he had any concern in the affairs of this <HI>lower world,</HI> the government of king∣doms, states and empires; but the oracles of truth instruct us better. It is true, <HI>that</HI> is the most noble part of his dominion, but he is said to <HI>look down from heaven;</HI> not as a bare <HI>spectator</HI> of the actions of men,

but as their LORD &amp; JUDGE, that he may <HI>render to every man according to his works. Fortune</HI> or <HI>chance</HI> has nothing to do, takes no place in the world, except in the absurd imaginations of men: The prophet <HI>Eze∣kiel'</HI>s wheels don't move &amp; roll at random, but under the direction of the <HI>cherubims.</HI> The government of CHRIST is a discreet &amp; wise authority, which none can justly fault: The wisest <HI>politicians,</HI> in their most deli∣berate acts, are often <HI>guilty of mistakes;</HI> and, when they see the <HI>event of things,</HI> wish they had ordered otherwise: But there is no imprudence or injustice in CHRIST, in his whole management. Some of his dispensations have the face of <HI>absolute sovereignty;</HI> but it is because our faculties are not strong enough to see into the amazing depths of wisdom contained in them: Others may seem to us <HI>disorderly</HI> and <HI>confused,</HI> tho' there is accountable <HI>reason</HI> for them. As to one event and another, we may say and admire as Rom. xi. 33. <HI>Oh the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and know∣ledge of GOD! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</HI> Our Lord CHRIST, in the execution of his REGAL office, is represented as mounted upon a <HI>Cherub, riding upon the heavens,</HI> and <HI>flying upon the wings of the wind:</HI> And the <HI>wonders</HI> of his <HI>providence</HI> are expressed in terms most sublime, both as to his acts of <HI>terror &amp; vengeance</HI> upon his <HI>ene∣mies,</HI> and of <HI>help</HI> to his <HI>friends:</HI> When he arises out of his place the <HI>earth trembles, the foundations of the hills are shaken, because he is wroth; there goes a smoak out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoureth.</HI> When his people are in distress, He <HI>rideth upon the heavens for their help, and in his excellency on the skie; and the stars in their courses fight their</HI> battles <HI>against</HI> Sisera. <HI>The clouds are his chariots,</HI> from them he

discharges his <HI>thunders,</HI> to the terror and amazement of mankind; and by them he <HI>waters the earth,</HI> and makes it verdant and fruitful, adorns it with the beautiful prospects it now affords us: And at his plea∣sure he shifts the scene, changes the face of the earth, strips it of his gay attire, and puts every thing around us in a dying posture, to remind us that we ourselves are so: <HI>By the breath of GOD the frost is given, and the breadth of the waters straitned, and he seals up the hands of every man:</HI> And then he operates <HI>under</HI> the earth, where no eye of man can penetrate, or his hand reach, and makes the <HI>pillars of the world tremble:</HI> He shakes it with the same ease that we can move a <HI>finger,</HI> or wave a <HI>feather,</HI> either from <HI>natural causes,</HI> or by an <HI>immediate act</HI> of <HI>power,</HI> we can't tell <HI>which,</HI> nor <HI>how; at this our hearts tremble and are moved out of their place.</HI></P>
<P>The great and sudden changes in <HI>publick</HI> affairs; the revolutions of states and kingdoms, which sur∣prize and astonish us, are the effects of a designing mind, of an alwise cause. The various conditions and circumstances of men, that some are prosperous, others adverse; some rich, and others poor; some in dignity, while others are low and level with the earth; is not the result of meer chance, but the design of CHRIST, and for <HI>wise</HI> ends. The <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>glory</HI> of the <HI>whole</HI> consists very much in the <HI>variety of its parts:</HI> And the <HI>qualifications</HI> of men, for the diffe∣rent <HI>stations</HI> and <HI>parts</HI> they are to act, in the rank of rational beings, is from CHRIST the <HI>fountain</HI> of <HI>wisdom.</HI> Thus CHRIST <HI>upon the throne</HI> is the LORD <HI>of all,</HI> and has <HI>authority</HI> and <HI>power</HI> sufficient to <HI>govern all</HI> by himself, and without the instrumentality of <HI>men</HI> or <HI>angels;</HI> but he is pleased to make use of <HI>them</HI> in the

conduct of his affairs both <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>ecclesiastical.</HI> As to his government by <HI>angels</HI> we know but little of it: They are invisible agents in the services they do us; but his rule by <HI>men</HI> is evident and indisputable; for he has said, <HI>Judges and officers shalt thou make in all thy gates which the</HI> LORD <HI>thy GOD giveth thee throughout thy tribes; and they shall judge the people:</HI> and the civil ruler is called <HI>the minister of GOD.</HI> The distinction of <HI>king</HI> and <HI>subject, rulers</HI> and <HI>ruled,</HI> is not the <HI>contrivance</HI> of designing men, but of <HI>divine ordination:</HI> 'Tis CHRIST upon the throne that has appointed <HI>magistracy,</HI> that advances <HI>men</HI> to superiour or subordinate offices, and accomplishes them for <HI>government;</HI> and has declared to us for what <HI>end</HI> he doth it, and accordingly what the <HI>people</HI> over whom they preside may expect from <HI>them,</HI> and they from <HI>him</HI> as they behave and manage in their respective <HI>spheres;</HI> and also what regard he will have <HI>us</HI> pay to <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>And here I shall be particular as the <HI>occasion</HI> leads me.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI><SUP>st</SUP></HI> then. <HI>Magistracy is an institution of</HI> CHRIST <HI>upon the throne.</HI> This is an assertion that stands in the strongest light in the sacred oracles. The <HI>wisdom</HI> of GOD thought it highly necessary for man in his apostate condition, whatever it might have been if he had kept his primitive state, and retained his original purity and glory; and therefore imposed it not as a <HI>burden,</HI> but a <HI>blessing</HI> upon mankind; for what is or can be more beneficial to the world? 'Tis the very life and soul of <HI>humane society;</HI> without it, what but perpetual <HI>discords</HI> and <HI>contentions</HI> might be expected? <HI>Oppression, injustice,</HI> and the most flagitious <HI>enormities</HI> would soon lift up their heads and grow

<HI>rampant,</HI> and the whole earth become a <HI>theatre</HI> of the most <HI>bloody tragedies.</HI> An <HI>ungovern'd society of men</HI> would be no better than a <HI>herd of savage beasts,</HI> worrying and devouring one another: To prevent this <HI>confusion,</HI> GOD has instituted <HI>civil government</HI> to be a guard upon our persons and lives, and defend us from the violence and injuries we might be exposed to from men more <HI>crafty</HI> and <HI>powerful</HI> than ourselves.</P>
<P>It was an unhappy <HI>juncture</HI> when there was <HI>no king in Israel</HI> to restrain the boisterous lusts and head∣strong passions of the people; but <HI>every man did that which was right in his own eyes; libertinism</HI> and <HI>li∣centiousness, idolatry</HI> and a <HI>practical contempt of GOD,</HI> his <HI>laws</HI> and <HI>worship,</HI> broke in like a flood upon the <HI>nation,</HI> and exposed them to the angry <HI>resentments</HI> of heaven. Where all authoritative &amp; coercive power is taken off, men will soon think that <HI>where there is no law, there is no transgression,</HI> and make it evident that it was not so much the dread of <HI>hell,</HI> as of a <HI>halter,</HI> that restrained them from the greatest villanies.</P>
<P>A <HI>common-wealth</HI> without <HI>government</HI> is like a <HI>body</HI> without <HI>eyes,</HI> which stands exposed to a thousand mischiefs, but can defend itself from none of them: To take away <HI>government,</HI> would be to deprive man∣kind of all that is <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>sacred,</HI> and to reduce a beautiful world to a meer chaotical state of darkness and confusion; but a well-ordered <HI>common-wealth</HI> how beautiful and glorious to behold! And how hap∣py the BRITISH <HI>constitution!</HI> and how justly may it be the admiration and the envy of the nations about it, with a KING upon the throne, swaying the <HI>sceptre</HI> of <HI>righteousness,</HI> with his <HI>nobles</HI> about him, and <HI>officers</HI> under him, in their several degrees of subordination! herein bearing some little and faint resemblance of the
<PB N="24" REF="005326_0023_1016BA7C24AF4028"/>
<HI>prophet's</HI> vision of the LORD <HI>sitting upon his throne, surrounded with his ministers, the holy angels,</HI> who are celebrating his <HI>glory</HI> and serving his <HI>government:</HI> Thus the <HI>sun,</HI> the fountain of light is placed in the <HI>centre,</HI> with the <HI>stars</HI> and <HI>planets</HI> in their respective orbs, and different degrees of magnitude, revolving about him, and all contributing to the benefit of <HI>our</HI> system. But supposing, that <HI>government</HI> had not been of <HI>divine institution,</HI> but mankind had been left intirely to their own liberty, there is no doubt but they would soon have been so fully convinced of the absolute necessity of it, that they would not have continued long with∣out it. <HI>Anarchy</HI> is such a state as no reasonable man would choose, there being no manner of safety in it, either of life or property. It was an ancient custom among the <HI>Persians</HI> to abrogate the laws of the king∣dom, shut up their courts of judicature, and silence the oracles of justice upon the death of their <HI>sovereign,</HI> and every man was left to his own empire for five days together; in which time such horrid things were done, and outrages committed as to convince them, by sad experience of the want of a king, and the ne∣cessity of laws. It was the just observation of the <HI>roman</HI> oraror, <HI>Nihil tam aptum est ad jus conditionem∣que naturae, quam imperium, sine quo,</HI> &amp;c. Nothing is so adapted to the state and priviledge of <HI>humane nature</HI> as <HI>government,</HI> without which it is impossible that <HI>families, cities</HI> or <HI>nations</HI> should subsist, yea without it the race of mankind would be soon extinct.</P>
<P>There is doubtless a certain <HI>oeconomy</HI> in the world above, amongst the bright intelligences that encompass the throne of GOD, and the LAMB: This seems to be plainly intimated by the distinguishing <HI>titles</HI> given them of <HI>thrones, dominions, angels, arch-angels, cheru∣bims,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="005326_0024_1016FF9CE8F03598"/>
and <HI>seraphims:</HI> There is a sort of <HI>regimen</HI> in the <HI>starry</HI> regions, in their higher and lower scituati∣tions and degrees, without which composition, they could not properly be called an <HI>army:</HI> And there is something of this to be found amongst the <HI>irrational</HI> tribes; the <HI>bees,</HI> as <HI>Virgil</HI> and others have observed, have their <HI>king,</HI> and the <HI>cranes</HI> their <HI>leader;</HI> and they observe their nocturnal watches in disposed orders. Thus <HI>magistracy</HI> is <HI>an ordinance of</HI> CHRIST, the alwise GOD and supreme LORD of the world: And seeing he has constituted it among men, he certainly de∣mands our practical acknowledgment of it; and who would be loth and backward to make this concession, since we are all beholden to <HI>government,</HI> for <HI>order, peace</HI> and <HI>religion?</HI> We are certainly worthy of no∣thing but confusion, if we are ungrateful to GOD, for regular <HI>government:</HI> Now we may <HI>dwell quietly in our houses,</HI> or <HI>sit under our own vines and fig-trees, and none to make us afraid:</HI> Now the <HI>wealth</HI> we obtain by <HI>honest</HI> industry, may be insured to posterity: Now we may be build <HI>temples</HI> for the worship of GOD, without danger of having them pulled down, by <HI>sa∣crilegious hands;</HI> and adore the GOD that made us, without being molested with <HI>mutinies</HI> and <HI>uproars:</HI> Now we may enjoy our <HI>sabbaths,</HI> and have constant opportunities for our souls, in the free use of all those means, whereby immortal spirits are trained up for the heavenly world: For these things, <HI>bless</HI> we GOD, and <HI>honour</HI> the KING.</P>
<P>But in asserting <HI>civil government</HI> to be an <HI>insti∣tution</HI> of CHRIST, I don't intend that any par∣ticular <HI>form</HI> of it is so; for this, the <HI>apostle</HI> ex∣pressly says, is an <HI>human ordinance.</HI> It was never the design of GOD, that any <HI>one</HI> model should <HI>universally</HI> obtain amongst mankind; for if it had, he would
<PB N="26" REF="005326_0025_1016FFA19A04FED8"/>
undoubtedly have expressly revealed it, and not left the world thus long in the dark; for <HI>divines</HI> of the greatest <HI>note</HI> and <HI>eminence,</HI> have never been able to find out any such <HI>intimation</HI> of his pleasure in <HI>holy writ:</HI> And if he had preferred any particular <HI>form,</HI> it is no ways probable that he would have permitted that of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> his favourite people, to have been so often changed, as we find it was no less than five times: It looks as if these several alterations of their <HI>constitution</HI> were permitted, on purpose to con∣vince the world that every <HI>form</HI> was alike indifferent to him; and that he left it to the prudence of <HI>every</HI> nation to make choice of <HI>that,</HI> which best suted their own <HI>tempers</HI> and <HI>circumstances,</HI> and that if any people sound <HI>their'</HI>s defective, the <HI>fault</HI> was their own if it was not reformed. And <HI>this</HI> being the true <HI>origin</HI> of <HI>civil government,</HI> it is a very natural inference that <HI>rulers</HI> derive their authority under GOD, from that <HI>constitution</HI> to which they belong; for it is absurd to suppose, that <HI>kings</HI> and <HI>governours</HI> are sent down im∣mediately from <HI>heaven,</HI> with their <HI>commissions</HI> in their hands: And since the <HI>power</HI> of the <HI>civil ruler</HI> flows from the <HI>constitution</HI> he is under, the natural extent of it is limited by the maxims of doing that, which is <HI>just</HI> and <HI>right</HI> to all under that <HI>constitution.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is</HI> CHRIST <HI>upon the throne that advances</HI> ma∣gistrates <HI>to their respective offices.</HI> Every one's <HI>calling</HI> and <HI>station</HI> in the world is of GOD, he has appointed the <HI>time</HI> of our coming upon the stage of action, the part we shall manage, and when we shall retire and make room for others. Thus <HI>Moses</HI> was called to conduct <HI>Israel</HI> his people; but the priesthood was set∣led upon <HI>Aaron: Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was his <HI>servant</HI>

to humble the pride of the <HI>Jews;</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> was raised up to overthrow the <HI>persian</HI> monarchy. One is designed to weild the sword, another to hold the plough; one to advise as an oracle of policy, another to excute. <HI>The powers that be, are ordained of GOD, and no man taketh this honour to himself:</HI> The <HI>thrones</HI> of earthly <HI>princes</HI> are his; thus it is said of <HI>Solomon,</HI> that <HI>he sat upon the throne of the</HI> LORD <HI>as king, in the room of</HI> David <HI>his father. Promotion</HI> comes not from the east or west, north or south; does not drop down from the clouds, or spring out of the earth, nor is blown into men's hands by the wind; but <HI>GOD is the judge, he putteth down one, and sitteth up another; by him kings reign, and princes decree justice; by him princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</HI></P>
<P>There have been some <HI>fanaticks,</HI> that, in the strongest terms, have denied the <HI>divine right</HI> of <HI>civil rulers;</HI> and asserted that no man's <HI>conscience</HI> was bound to a <HI>submission</HI> to them, and to <HI>oppose</HI> their <HI>authority,</HI> was no immoral act: of this stamp were the <HI>Mani∣chees,</HI> the <HI>German Anabaptists,</HI> and other <HI>enthusiastick sectaries</HI> since, who, under a pretence of setting up the <HI>throne of</HI> CHRIST, have been for subverting the <HI>thrones</HI> of <HI>kings,</HI> as if they were diametrically opposite as GOD and <HI>Belial,</HI> as <HI>heaven</HI> and <HI>hell;</HI> but this is to confront the <HI>sovereignty</HI> of the <HI>most high,</HI> who in the plainest terms assures us, that the <HI>higher powers</HI> are from <HI>him,</HI> and have the impress of <HI>divinity</HI> upon them. But then this is, in a <HI>mediate</HI> manner, for there is no <HI>title</HI> to dominion by GOD's <HI>immediate</HI> designa∣tion, as it was in <HI>David'</HI>s case, and his successor <HI>Solo∣mon;</HI> no <HI>prophet</HI> or <HI>vision</HI> is now to be looked for, and there is no <HI>king</HI> or <HI>ruler</HI> upon the earth, that, if he pretends to such a right to <HI>govern,</HI> is able to make

out his <HI>claim:</HI> It is by the <HI>mediation</HI> of men, that <HI>rulers</HI> are <HI>constituted,</HI> from the <HI>king</HI> upon the <HI>throne,</HI> to the lowest <HI>officer</HI> under him, and nothing but ordi∣nary <HI>providence</HI> is to be expected in it.

of himself, which is the supreme <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>happiness</HI> of the <HI>rational creature;</HI> that he may rectify the dis∣orders of our natures, restore his <HI>image</HI> bright in us, and raise up to himself <HI>beautiful temples</HI> out of the <HI>ruins</HI> of <HI>apostacy,</HI> and mould us into that <HI>divine form</HI> which is requisite to prepare us for the heavenly world and our everlasting abode there: To this end both the doctrinal and preceptive part of his religion natu∣rally tend; and in this, his <HI>providential dispensations</HI> do all concur &amp; unite; and if this good design of his government over us is not reached, it is our own fault.</P>
<P>Now in this the GOD of heaven is a <HI>pattern</HI> to our earthly GODS; and it is their duty and glory to <HI>imi∣tate him</HI> herein; for in nothing can they resemble him more than in concerting measures, and laying out themselves for the good of others: They are stiled <HI>nursing fathers,</HI> and as such must be as extensively beneficial as they can, to all under their care, protect the innocent, right the injured, encourage the diligent, supprss disorders, punish the disobedient, defend the poor and needy, the widows and fatherless from fraud and violenec; and how little does that <HI>magistrate</HI> com∣port with his character, who does not make <HI>these</HI> his governing design. <HI>Civil power</HI> is not to be looked upon as an empty, insignificant <HI>name,</HI> a meer sound without substance: The <HI>sun</HI> in the heavens was not placed in his exalted sphere, merely to be gazed at, but to afford light and heat to the earth, for the pro∣duction of <HI>grain</HI> and <HI>fruit, herbs</HI> and <HI>flowers,</HI> for the delight and benefit of mankind: And the more <HI>exal∣ted stations</HI> persons sustain, so much the greater <HI>care</HI> and <HI>business</HI> lies upon their hands, that instead of in∣dulging themselves in ease and delicacy, they are to watch <HI>night</HI> and <HI>day,</HI> and be always <HI>contriving</HI> and

<HI>active</HI> for the prosperity and welfare of their people▪ But they should be especially concerned to promote the <HI>honour and interest of religion</HI> among the people, by good <HI>laws,</HI> and their good <HI>example:</HI> It is the <HI>main</HI> qualification of a <HI>governour,</HI> that he endeavours to make his subjects <HI>good men</HI> and <HI>good christians,</HI> obse∣quious to the laws of GOD, and loyal to the <HI>crown</HI> of heaven: And those of <HI>supreme dignity</HI> should ex∣ercise special care, that the <HI>truths</HI> and <HI>ways</HI> of GOD are not reproached by the <HI>ill principles</HI> and <HI>practices</HI> of those in <HI>subordinate</HI> powers: This was the good resolution of the pious king <HI>David,</HI> Psalm ci. 3, 6. <HI>I will set no wicked thing,</HI> or person, <HI>before mine eyes, I hate the work of them that turn aside, it shall not cleave to me: Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land.</HI> Those only he would <HI>search for,</HI> and <HI>pro∣mote,</HI> that would design and act for the <HI>honour of GOD,</HI> and the <HI>publick good,</HI> and not those that were <HI>grasping after preferment</HI> from <HI>selffish</HI> views, to enrich or aggrandize <HI>themselves</HI> by empowerishing their <HI>subjects:</HI> As they rule <HI>by</HI> CHRIST, they should rule <HI>for</HI> him, and make it evident by their good lives, that <HI>authority</HI> and <HI>religion, grace &amp; government,</HI> are not inconsistent things.

<P><Q>We think it well becomes our <HI>high place</HI> and <HI>station,</HI> said that excellent Emperor <HI>Theodosius,</HI> to give admonitions and injunctions to our <HI>subjects</HI> con∣cerning <HI>religion.</HI></Q> Again says he, <Q>We do no∣thing in the heat of <HI>war▪</HI> or the cool retirements of <HI>peace,</HI> but consult and order how the <HI>good subjects</HI> of our empire may truly worship GOD, and spend their days in his service.</Q> This was a noble <HI>speech;</HI> and it is the glory of a <HI>christian governour</HI> to say and
<PB N="31" REF="005326_0030_1016FFB14A1F00E0"/>
do likewise, to advance the <HI>religion</HI> of GOD our SA∣VIOUR, to be a <HI>guardian</HI> to his <HI>churches,</HI> a <HI>patron</HI> of <HI>virtue,</HI> a <HI>promoter</HI> of <HI>learning,</HI> and to shine in all the <HI>graces</HI> that adorn the <HI>christian:</HI> These are the most splendid ornaments in a <HI>prince'</HI>s crown, attractive of the divine love, the <HI>delight</HI> of angels, and the <HI>admi∣ration</HI> of men: Such a magistrate is <HI>a man after GOD's own heart,</HI> and may depend upon the divine conduct in his affairs <HI>personal</HI> and <HI>political:</HI> This will com∣mand the most profound reverence, and the highest <HI>love</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> from his people: Then will these apostolick <HI>canons</HI> come with a peculiar emphasis, and they will see the admirable beauty of them: <HI>Be ye subject to every ordinance of man, for the</HI> LORD'<HI>s sake; put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers; to obey magistrates,</HI> &amp;c. Indeed a people under the <HI>influence</HI> of <HI>religious</HI> principles and strongly impressed with a sense of their duty to GOD, and rightly distinguishing betwixt the <HI>man</HI> and the <HI>office,</HI> will obey a <HI>bad</HI> magistrate in things not in themselves unlawful: Thus the <HI>christians</HI> were observant of the imperial edicts of <HI>Commodus, Phoras,</HI> &amp;c. but it can∣not be thought to be with that <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>alacrity</HI> as to a <HI>good</HI> ruler. The <HI>apostle</HI> speaking of the inten∣tion of magistracy, says, that <HI>rulers are not a terror to</HI> good <HI>works, but to the</HI> evil. They should appear like the HOST of GOD <HI>formidable</HI> and <HI>terrible,</HI> the <HI>cheru∣bims</HI> that guarded the tree of life with the flaming sword of justice in their hands, to execute wrath up∣on the bold and daring criminals, and to suppress vice and immorality, in all its forms and complexions, and to drive it if possible out of the land: <HI>Wickedness</HI> naturally tends to deprive a people of the divine smiles and protection, and to bring down distressing calami∣ties
<PB N="32" REF="005326_0031_1016FFB2EA66A510"/>
upon them. The prosperity of a <HI>province</HI> infalli∣bly depends upon the favour and blessings of heaven, but if GOD be gone from us, what can be expected but a series of woes and judgments? Such a people cannot subsist long, but must inevitably sink into dis∣grace and ruine, which to prevent should be the care and endeavour of the <HI>civil ruler.</HI> The apostle adds—<HI>a praise to them that do well;</HI> that do their <HI>own proper business,</HI> that confine their zeal and activity within their own limits, and <HI>wherein they are called of GOD, there abide,</HI> and are faithful; these shall have the countenance and protection of those under whom they serve.</P>
<P>But its time that I proceed to the next particular to be considered, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The qualifications of the</HI> civil magistrate, <HI>or what he must be according to the direction of </HI> CHRIST, <HI>to answer the design of his constitution, and that he may dis∣charge with fidelity, and to divine acceptance, the im∣portant trust reposed in him.</HI> It is not <HI>every man</HI> that is fit to govern, how much soever he may think him∣self qualified for it: The weight of government is too heavy to be laid upon every one's shoulder, they must be <HI>able men</HI> to surmount its difficulties, and wade thro' its emergencies. There may be many <HI>excellent qua∣lities</HI> in a man, and yet he may not have a turn for government: The great &amp; glorious characters by which rulers are known &amp; distinguished in the sacred oracles, convey to us such sublime ideas, as cannot be in any measure answered, except by here and there <HI>one</HI> of an exraordinary genius: Sometimes they are dignified with the title of GOD's, Exod. 22. 28. <HI>Thou shalt not revile the</HI> GODS. GOD himself stiles them so; and how much does it <HI>magnify</HI> their <HI>office,</HI> and what re∣verence
<PB N="33" REF="005326_0032_1016FFB5C844FD38"/>
and honour does it call for from us? They are stiled the <HI>lights of a people.</HI> Thus the royal <HI>David </HI> was the <HI>light of Israel:</HI> They are lights for splendor, counsel and comfort; and what greater title can be given of a mortal man? or, what more is spoken of GOD himself? <HI>GOD is light;</HI> wisdom and know∣ledge, power, purity and all perfection is comprehend∣ed in it. Sometimes they have the character and style of <HI>shields of the earth,</HI> Psal. xlvii. 9. <HI>The shields of the earth belong to the</HI> LORD; i. e. <HI>magistrates,</HI> the pro∣tectors and guardians of a nation, are <HI>dependant</HI> upon GOD: And it is a great blessing to a people to have <HI>such shields,</HI> especially when it may be said of <HI>them,</HI> that they <HI>belong</HI> to the LORD; that is, not only <HI>con∣stituted by</HI> him, but <HI>devoted to</HI> him, employed for his honour, and his people's interest: Then he is greatly exalted, when princes and governours and inferiour officers exert their power to promote the kingdom &amp; interest of CHRIST, &amp; to defend their people from insult &amp;▪ oppression. I say, when we reflect upon <HI>such titles</HI> of the <HI>civil magistrate,</HI> as they suggest to us something very superiour, and are almost apt to raise our thoughts of <HI>him</HI> as another <HI>sort</HI> of being, that approaches nearer to <HI>divinity</HI> than mankind generally does, so to expect from him something proportionably great and good. It was <HI>Jethro'</HI>s advice to <HI>Moses,</HI> to <HI>provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear GOD, men of truth, hating covetousness,</HI> and place <HI>such</HI> over them to be rulers.</P>
<P>To be particular here,</P>
<P N="1">. <HI>A principle of</HI> true grace <HI>living and reigning in the heart, is the</HI> first <HI>and</HI> best <HI>qualification in a magistrate.</HI> It is the just observation of one, that <HI>no</HI> Principles, but those of <HI>religion,</HI> are sufficient to form
<PB N="34" REF="005326_0033_1016FFB8A38F35E0"/>
a <HI>great</HI> man; all other accomplishments separate from this, will loose their lustre and glory: It is <HI>piety</HI> that <HI>makes the face of a</HI> ruler <HI>to shine.</HI> This is his brightest ornament, as <HI>holiness</HI> is the most orient pearl in the crown of heaven: All the bright ornaments of <HI>Greece,</HI> or all the <HI>Roman</HI> dictators and consuls were not so great &amp; honourable as the <HI>christian</HI> magistrate cloathed with the <HI>robe of holiness,</HI> &amp; resplendent in the <HI>image of GOD:</HI> All the eloquence and oratory of <HI>Cicero;</HI> or all the great atchievements and conquests of <HI>Caesar,</HI> for which they have been so much celebrated, don't ren∣der them worthy of that esteem, love and honour which is justly paid to a <HI>christian</HI> Governour; who, by the charmes of his good example, the noble conquest of his own lusts and passions, his holy zeal for GOD, and faithful endeavours to advance the best interests of his people, is render'd worthy of the highest honour. GOD himself esteems and honours such a ruler, and will honour him in the regions of the blessed: He now <HI>shines as the sun when he goes forth in his strength;</HI> and shall hereafter <HI>shine as the brightness of the firma∣ment</HI> in the world of light and glory.</P>
<P>The GODS of a people should adorn their exalted stations with <HI>sobriety, righteousness</HI> and <HI>sanctity.</HI> They are, as one expresses, <HI>lights</HI> upon a hill visible to all, and they cannot transgress, but like the <HI>eclipse</HI> of the <HI>sun,</HI> every one observes it, and the smallest defect in them obscures the whole orb of their virtues. The <HI>Roman Optimates</HI> were so to behave in all things as to make their conduct approved by every good man, and worthy the imitation of all: Their <HI>Censors</HI> and <HI>Prae∣tors</HI> were to inspect the morals, and correct the vices and extravagancies of the people. It was given in charge by the GOD of <HI>Israel,</HI> to the electors of the empire to chuse the person that he should nominate
<PB N="35" REF="005326_0034_1016FFBCCC1DB710"/>
to be their king; and to the king so elected, to act un∣der the influence of religious laws in his administration, Deut. 17. 18. <HI>It shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the</HI> LORD <HI>his GOD, that his heart be not lifted up, and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left:</HI> And to excite him to this, and to induce to practice what he read, he is told the advantage that his religion would be unto him, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>it would prolong his government, and entail a blessing upon his posterity.</HI> Secular dignity lays no foundation for a blessed hope, translates no man to the coelestial paradise: 'Tis only <HI>holiness</HI> that qualifies for <HI>happiness,</HI> the vision of CHRIST <HI>upon the throne,</HI> and <HI>the rivers of pleasures that flow from it.</HI> The <HI>sancti∣fying</HI> work of the <HI>divine spirit</HI> upon the soul, and his testimony to it, in concurrence with our own spirit, is that alone which can give us that sweet <HI>peace which passeth all understanding,</HI> a divine calm in a dying hour, and afford us a comfortable prospect of future glory. It is not the <HI>coat</HI> and <HI>character</HI> of a minister of state, that will be any advantage to him in the great audit-day, that will secure him from the animadversions of the supreme JUDGE, or render his doom any thing less severe: It won't make in his fa∣vour to plead, that he has been a <HI>ruler</HI> over men, and sustain'd such a <HI>post.</HI> 'Tis nothing but our <HI>graces,</HI> and <HI>good works,</HI> the genuine product of them, that will recommend us to the divine acceptance: If our station and business be high, if we have not the hearts of sincere humble <HI>christians,</HI> we shall have but the greater ignominy, and fall at last. Our earthly GODS must
<PB N="36" REF="005326_0035_1016FFBE52600290"/>
stand at the <HI>same barr,</HI> and be judged by the <HI>same rule</HI> with their people; and without an impression of the <HI>divine character</HI> upon them, they shall have the doom of the <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>slothful servant,</HI> and be ex∣cluded the blissful presence and kingdom of GOD for ever. We see then the <HI>obligation</HI> upon magistrates to be <HI>good men:</HI> 'Tis absolutely necessary to them∣selves and their own <HI>comfort</HI> in the <HI>present,</HI> and <HI>hap∣piness</HI> in the <HI>coming</HI> world; and it is necessary to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> people, to form them to religion and virtue, by the shining examples of it in their own persons.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Great</HI> knowledge <HI>and</HI> wisdom, <HI>are essential qualifications in</HI> civil rulers. <HI>Piety</HI> alone won't do; for then every <HI>good man</HI> would be qualified to rule, which it is certain he is not; but they must be <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>understanding</HI> men, and like the accomplished ruler of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who conducted his people, as in the <HI>integrity of his heart,</HI> so <HI>with the skillfulness of his hands:</HI> How can the grand intentions of government be served, or how can government itself be secured from contempt, when it falls into weak and unskillful hands? If <HI>the blind lead the blind,</HI> there's no need of an oracle from heaven to foretel the consequents. <HI>Ocu∣lum cum sceptro,</HI> was the <HI>Egyptian</HI> emblem of govern∣ment. <Q>It is the same frantick madness, says Dr. <HI>Henry More,</HI> to exile <HI>prudence</HI> out of the <HI>affairs of state,</HI> as to exclude <HI>reason</HI> out of the <HI>mathematicks</HI> and <HI>philosophy.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It bodes well to a people when it may be said of them as Ezek. 27. 8. <HI>Thy wise men, oh</HI> Tyrus <HI>that were in thee, were thy pilots.</HI> Men skilled in the art of <HI>navi∣gation,</HI> and could direct their brave fleets in times and places of danger, their safety and prosperity consisted
<PB N="37" REF="005326_0036_1016FFC2ABFD5A40"/>
very much in having such wise men in so useful and important a service. Magistrates are the <HI>pilots</HI> of a people, and therefore must be men of great wisdom and prudence; an ignorant pilot is a <HI>solecism,</HI> and to what purpose is the office of a magistrate without abi∣lity to execute it? A weak and giddy head will soon cause a staggering body, and a ruined state: The po∣litical house must inevitably fall that has the slender reed, instead of strong pillars, to support it. <HI>Know∣ledge</HI> and <HI>wisdom</HI> are the two eyes of the magistrate; with one he views the people in their constitution, tempers and outward circumstances, what are their dangers, and from what causes they arise, and what may be done to prevent them; with the other he forms such schemes, and applies such remedies as are proper to the case. Who then is sufficient for these things? where is the man that answers the character of an accomplished ruler? he is like <HI>Elihu's</HI> interpre∣ter, <HI>one among a thousand.</HI> Indeed almost every man thinks himself qualified to set at helm, guide and go∣vern publick affairs; but this is because he is both a stranger to himself, and to the difficulties of government.</P>
<P N="3">3. Courage <HI>is a necessary and excellent quality in a magistrate.</HI> Knowledge of the state of the <HI>province,</HI> and wisdom to conduct its affairs to advantage, will be to but little purpose without <HI>courage:</HI> These in conjunction won't fail to distinguish a man amongst those of his own rank and order; but if he possesses the former, the latter being wanting, it may be of ill consequence, as it may deter him from speaking or act∣ing freely, in any matter that lies before him. If the head is crowded with sublime and noble ideas, and these ranged in most beautiful order; 'tis <HI>courage</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="005326_0037_1016FFC5E99F9038"/>
must draw them out into act and exercise, and render them serviceable to the publick. A <HI>cowardly</HI> magis∣trate is like the timerous <HI>hare</HI> in a <HI>lion</HI>'s den; the frown or check of a great personage will frighten him out of his conscience, and obstruct the execution of justice. The <HI>Athenian</HI> judges held their courts in <HI>Mars-street,</HI> to shew that they had <HI>martial</HI> fire, tho' cloathed with <HI>Apollo's</HI> robes.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>They must be</HI> just <HI>men.</HI> The GOD and gover∣nour of the world is <HI>just,</HI> and in this a pattern to rulers, who should endeavour to be <HI>righteous</HI> as he is <HI>righte∣ous.</HI> This is what he expressly requires of them; <HI>the GOD of Israel said it, and the rock of Israel spake it. He that ruleth over men must be just.</HI> Justice obliges the magistrate to deal fairly and righteously between man and man, to protect the innocent, and right the injured. There is <HI>an iniquity to be punished by the judges;</HI> and <HI>there is a reward for the righteous,</HI> which the <HI>minister of justice</HI> must see distributed, as he would not <HI>bear the sword in vain.</HI> The <HI>just</HI> ruler will take care that righteous laws, and none but such, are im∣posed upon the subject; and when made, that they are enforced with proper sanctions, and duly executed according to the regards that are paid to them. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> were used to picture their <HI>judges</HI> without <HI>hands,</HI> as some other nations have done without <HI>eyes,</HI> that they might not be guilty of <HI>bribery,</HI> which <HI>blind∣eth the eyes of the wise,</HI> and <HI>perverts the words of righ∣teousness.</HI> The opposite to this, viz. <HI>injustice,</HI> is re∣pugnant to the laws of GOD, and the precepts of christianity; and the unjust man <HI>is abhorred of the</HI> LORD: The apostle's words are shocking, and one would think sufficient for ever to deter men from the
<PB N="39" REF="005326_0038_1016FFC8C77C07E8"/>
practice of this sin, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> ii. 12. So that <HI>injustice</HI> is a sin that is inconsistent with the fear of GOD, or a principle of grace in the soul: 'Tis impossible that there can be sincere and undissembled <HI>piety towards GOD,</HI> where there is not <HI>righteousness</HI> towards men. 'Tis one of the <HI>main</HI> strokes in the character of a citizen of <HI>Zion,</HI> that <HI>he walketh uprightly,</HI> and <HI>worketh righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. And finally. <HI>They must be men of a</HI> publick spirit; seeking the good of all their people, and not to enrich themselves: The <HI>avaritious</HI> magistrate is com∣pared by the prophet to a <HI>wolf</HI> ravening the prey, and aiming at nothing but to get dishonest gain, Ezek. 22. 27. When it may be said of a magistrate, <HI>thine eyes and thine heart are not but for covetousness,</HI> What but mischiefs to the publick, oppression and every sort of villany may be expected from him?</P>
<P>Thus I have considered the <HI>qualifications</HI> of <HI>civil rulers;</HI> or what they are to be and do, according to that power they have received from CHRIST, and that relation wherein they stand. And when rulers are thus qualified, it is from CHRIST: He is the fountain of all good, and distributes his blessings as pleaseth him; and they are his gifts and graces that adorn the magistrate, and in which he shines.</P>
<P>I am now to consider,</P>
<P>In the 5<SUP>th</SUP> and last place. <HI>The</HI> regards <HI>which</HI> CHRIST <HI>upon the throne, who has constituted civil rulers, will have us pay to them.</HI> Now we are to honour them as temporal fathers; to support the dignity of government by paying them their <HI>just tributes;</HI> to pray for the divine blessing upon their persons and
<PB N="40" REF="005326_0039_1016FFCB9DD96B20"/>
administrations; and to yeild a voluntary and chearful subjection to them in all their lawful demands. The debt of <HI>honour</HI> to them is a moral precept, doubtless couched under the law of the <HI>fifth</HI> commandment. <HI>Honour the king,</HI> which may include <HI>inferiour officers,</HI> is also an apostolick charge: This honour is to be ex∣pressed by outward gestures, and by defending and preserving their character against such <HI>male-contents</HI> as make too free and bold with it, <HI>speak evil of dignities,</HI> and reproach their administration; and by <HI>rendering</HI> them that <HI>tribute</HI> or <HI>custom</HI> which is proper in their exalted stations. And then, as we should <HI>pray</HI> that they may be under the <HI>divine influence</HI> and <HI>conduct,</HI> from the KING upon the throne to the <HI>lowest officer</HI> under him, so we should <HI>submit to every ordinance of man for the</HI> LORD's <HI>sake;</HI> the apostle's words are awful Rom. 13. 2. <HI>Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of GOD; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation:</HI> It intends <HI>lawful</HI> authority; for it is no fault at all, but a duty to disobey, if these <HI>injunctions</HI> are opposite to the laws of GOD: It is an eternal maxim of truth, that GOD must be obeyed rather than man.</P>
<P>But I may not enlarge upon these things, but pass to the use of what has been spoken in some <HI>inferences,</HI> omitting others.</P>
<P>USE I. How <HI>great</HI> and <HI>incomprehensible</HI> is this <HI>mystery,</HI> CHRIST <HI>upon the throne, wearing the crow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and swaying the sceptre there.</HI> 'Tis his <HI>humanity</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the subject of all this honour. As GOD he was not capable of advancement, but has a natural right to the throne, and to all the grandeur, properties and powers of it: But that <HI>flesh</HI> and <HI>blood</HI> should be so raised and
<PB N="41" REF="005326_0040_1016FFCD528472B0"/>
dignified by being united to the SON of GOD, is a most surprizing project of unsearcheable wisdom, and comprehended by none but GOD himself; the apostle calls it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that <HI>GOD was manifest in flesh,—and recieved up to glory.</HI> There can be no greater dis∣proportion than between <HI>infinite</HI> &amp; <HI>finite, GOD</HI> &amp; <HI>man,</HI> the CREATOR &amp; a <HI>creature;</HI> and yet these are so con∣joined as to constitute <HI>one</HI> person. What strange <HI>pa∣radoxes</HI> are these, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>mighty</HI> GOD is a <HI>Child born,</HI> and the <HI>everlasting</HI> FATHER, a <HI>Son given;</HI> that the <HI>eternal</HI> was made in <HI>time;</HI> and the <HI>immortal, mortal;</HI> and yet continuing <HI>eternal, infinite:</HI> Oh in∣effable display of wisdom! The result whereof will be the admiration and praise of its glories, in an end∣less duration: To unite a <HI>rational soul</HI> to a <HI>lump of clay,</HI> or to join a <HI>clod of earth</HI> to the <HI>sun,</HI> is the effect of a boundless strength; but the <HI>union</HI> of the <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>human</HI> nature in the <HI>person of</HI> CHRIST, is an effect of wisdom and power infinitely beyond these: The angels of light &amp; glory are not herein comprehensors, but are prying into it; and it will be the matter of their eternal inquiries,</P>
<P>USE II. We infer, That CHRIST <HI>upon the throne</HI> is to be praised for his <HI>royalty,</HI> and for all the displays of his goodness and mercy <HI>to ourselves and others, to our King and nation, and to our land.</HI> 'Tis the employ of the happy myriads that guard his <HI>throne,</HI> to <HI>ascribe blessing and honour and thanksgiving to him:</HI> The pro∣phet <HI>Isaiah</HI> beheld, and heard the sevices thus praid to him, in an universal consent and harmony; and with such a strong affection and fervent zeal, that, as the <HI>visionary</HI> disciple represents it, their <HI>voices were loud as thunder;</HI> and also melodious as <HI>harpers, harp∣ing
<PB N="42" REF="005326_0041_1016FFD180100978"/>
with their harps.</HI> And this should be our employ while here on earth; <HI>we</HI> should bear a joyful part in the <HI>new song</HI> which the <HI>angels</HI> sing; <HI>we</HI> should cele∣brate him as our <HI>victorious deliverer</HI> from the united powers of sin and hell; and as the <HI>actual bestower</HI> of all those blessings upon us, to which the comfort of the present life is owing, and on which our future and everlasting happiness depends; <HI>we</HI> should often reflect upon the <HI>many</HI> and <HI>various instances</HI> of his <HI>goodness</HI> to us; and <HI>mention,</HI> with pleasure, <HI>his great goodness to∣wards the house of <HI>our</HI> Israel, which he hath bestowed upon them,</HI> from our beginnings unto this day; and how from a <HI>small number,</HI> we are increased to a <HI>great multitude;</HI> our <HI>religious</HI> and <HI>civil liberties,</HI> our <HI>magis∣tracy</HI> and <HI>ministry,</HI> our <HI>churches</HI> and <HI>colleges,</HI> are the rich &amp; invaluable blessings of CHRIST <HI>upon the throne;</HI> and which loudly call for our grateful acknowledge∣ments <HI>this day.</HI> And now, <HI>Blessed be the</HI> LORD <HI>GOD,</HI> the GOD of NEW-ENGLAND, <HI>who only doth wondrous things,</HI> and <HI>blessed be his glorious name forever; and let all the people say,</HI> Amen. <HI>We</HI> have great cause to be thankful for the <HI>good government</HI> we are under, both as to the KING and <HI>ministry</HI> at home; and those in <HI>immediate authority</HI> over us. And we would take this most publick occasion to express our gratitude to the MOST HIGH, for the <HI>remarkable preservation</HI> of the life of our KING, and his <HI>royal</HI> SON the <HI>Duke of Cumberland,</HI> in the late battel at <HI>Dettingen.</HI> And our obligation to gratitude is greatly increased by his deliverance from the late designed <HI>French in∣vasion;</HI> which if it had succeeded, what dire cala∣mities would have been consequent upon it, the <HI>nation</HI> would have been an <HI>aceldema, a field of blood &amp; rapine,</HI> and reduced to <HI>slavery:</HI> Thanks be to the LORD <HI>upon</HI>

<HI>the throne,</HI> that has not given the nation over as a prey to her adversaries; but has broken their purposes, diminished their forces, and made them unable to ac∣complish their mischievous devices. Let us now adore and sing with <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> after the destruction of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> host, <HI>Thou didst blow with thy wind, and scatteredst them, the sea covered</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some Hundreds of them.</NOTE> <HI>them, they sunk as lead in the mighty waters: Who is like unto thee, Oh</HI> LORD,—<HI>fearful in praises doing wonders.</HI> And now may GOD yet and long preserve the <HI>lamp which he hath ordained for his anointed;</HI> pro∣tect and defend him from all secret attempts and open violence, and may he be <HI>wise as an angel of GOD</HI> to conduct the great affairs of the kingdom in this cloudy day; and may he <HI>succeed</HI> in the present war, and his just arms prove <HI>victorious!</HI> and I doubt not but that it is the united voice of all the sons of <HI>New-England, GOD save King</HI> GEORGE, and <HI>speak well of his ser∣vant, and of his royal house, for a great while to come.</HI></P>
<P>USE III. Doth the Lord CHRIST reign, let us all <HI>stand in awe of him,</HI> and <HI>not in a slavish fear and dread of any of our fellow-creatures.</HI> He that is great and exalted above all, is <HI>greatly to be feared, his power is infinite;</HI> whereas the power of man is limited and can extend no farther then GOD permits. When his people the <HI>Jews</HI> were dejected by the numbers and threats of their enemies, he rebukes their fears, and tells them how absurd and impious it was to be in such dread of dying men, Isai. 51. 12.—<HI>Who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man, that shall be made as grass; and forgettest
<PB N="44" REF="005326_0043_1016FFD7891D2528"/>
the</HI> LORD <HI>thy maker?</HI> The royal <HI>psalmist,</HI> with a vigo∣rous faith, triumphs in GOD, the GOD <HI>of his salvation,</HI> when <HI>the wicked, even his enemies came upon</HI> him <HI>to eat up his flesh;</HI> and nobly resolves, that <HI>though an host should encamp against him, his heart should not fear, and tho' war should arise against him, in this he would be confident.</HI> CHRIST <HI>upon the throne,</HI> is the LORD of HOSTS; and whatever mischievous intentions our enemies, by sea or land, may have against us, he can protect us, who is <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>strong and mighty, the</HI> LORD <HI>mighty in battel;</HI> and he will do so if we make him our friend. Let us then fear and reverence him, and we are safe; he <HI>will hide us in his pavilion;—he will set our feet upon a rock, and lift up our head above our enemies round about us.</HI></P>
<P>USE IV. Hath the LORD upon the Throne ap∣pointed civil rulers for the <HI>good</HI> of his people, they should then <HI>endeavour to comport</HI> with the design of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> advancement. <HI>My honoured Fathers,</HI> CHRIST in his providence has constituted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the present guar∣dians of our lives, religion and properties; a very great and important trust is herein committed to you; and the eyes the GOD, angels and men are upon you to observe you in the management of it.</P>
<P>To excite you then to fidelity herein, be pleased to consider, and bear upon your minds these three things, viz. <HI>Who</HI> it is that you act for: That your <HI>time</HI> is <HI>limited</HI> and <HI>short:</HI> And, the <HI>account</HI> you must quickly give up to the great and impartial JUDGE of the world.</P>
<P><HI>Who</HI> it is you act for; and that you are the mini∣sters of CHRIST, the LORD of heaven and earth; and as you act <HI>by</HI> him, it should be <HI>for</HI> him: His interest
<PB N="45" REF="005326_0044_1016FFD94DCADE58"/>
and glory, and the good of this people, should be your governing design in all your <HI>debates</HI> and <HI>resolves, acts</HI> and <HI>laws,</HI> that you pass: And if it be so, you may expect the <HI>divine presence</HI> with you, and that <HI>GOD himself will stand in the congregation of the mighty, &amp;c.</HI> And then you may expect that you will be the happy instruments of our peace and prosperity, and of the growth and flourishing of religion among us; then <HI>truth will spring out of the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Again consider,</P>
<P>That your <HI>time of service</HI> for CHRIST and this people is <HI>limited</HI> and <HI>short,</HI> This is a melancholy motive, but should be a quickning one, to our rulers, and to us all, to be active and diligent in the service before us; as our LORD himself was quickned in his work from this consideration. 'Tis a dying world we are in; <HI>our days on earth are as a shadow, there is none abiding.</HI></P>
<P>Where are all the sons of same we read of in past ages? And, where are those that once were the lights of <HI>our Israel,</HI> our sheilds and our glory? Sad expe∣rience has often told us that <HI>earthly</HI> GODS <HI>die like men.</HI> How many shining examples of wisdom, learning and piety have we seen adorning the <HI>chair</HI> and the <HI>council-board,</HI> which our eyes shall see no more? Where are the great names of DUDLEY, STOUGHTON, BURNIT, and others? Or, Where are the honourable gentlemen of a lower sphere, the WINTHROPS, HUTCHINSONS, SEWALL, or the late honourable Col. DUDLEY, an instance fresh in our minds? <HI>Vixerunt, sed mortui sunt; they</HI> are all gone; and <HI>you,</HI> gentlemen, that succeed them are dying men: Your great and splendid <HI>titles,</HI> your exalted <HI>stations</HI> won't exempt you a moment
<PB N="46" REF="005326_0045_1016FFDF2A205510"/>
from <HI>death;</HI> but you that frame laws for others, are alike subject with them to the law of mortality. <HI>Death</HI> strains no compliments with earthly GODS: The man of <HI>honour</HI> must die as well as the <HI>clown</HI> or <HI>beggar;</HI> death will strip him of his purple attire, and cover him with cold earth. Place yourselves then, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> at the end of this beautiful scene, and passing out of flying time into the world of spirits; think and say with the royal psalmist in the midst of his wealth and honours, <HI>Thou hast put,</HI> LORD, <HI>a measure to my days, and my substance is as nothing.</HI> Such reflections as these would be serviceable to excite you to diligence and fidelity, in the discharge of your duty, in your respective posts of honour and service.</P>
<P>Again consider,</P>
<P>The <HI>account</HI> you must quickly give up to the great and impartial JUDGE of the world. And how will magistrates, negligent of their duty, dare to hold up their guilty heads, before the flaming tribunal above; when they shall be charged not only with their own <HI>personal</HI> sins, but with all <HI>other's</HI> sins, perpetrated by their contrivance? Such loads of guilt will expose them to a most intolerable doom and punishment in the other world.</P>
<P>Suffer me now to address your EXCELLENCY, the honourable BOARD, and the honourable house of REPRESENTATIVES, particularly, in a few words.</P>
<P><HI>May it please your</HI> EXCELLENCY, whom the LORD <HI>upon the throne</HI> has seated in the <HI>first chair</HI> of <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>power</HI> over us; and we acknowledge and adore his kind hand of providence in it, and that your EXCELLENCY'S administration has been to general
<PB N="47" REF="005326_0046_1016FFE20154AED8"/>
acceptance among us; which affords us ground to hope that it will be your desire and endeavour to make us happy, by a vigorous prosecution of every thing within your sphere, that is requisite to promote the religious and civil interests of this people.</P>
<P>Your EXCELLENCY has the honour of being placed at the <HI>head</HI> of a <HI>province,</HI> that has been as remarkable for piety towards GOD, and loyalty to the <HI>crown,</HI> as any one in the <HI>British</HI> dominions: A <HI>province</HI> that has been the delight and the care of heaven, and in a very signal manner smil'd on the prospered; that it may be said,—<HI>Who is like unto thee, Oh people, saved by the</HI> LORD, <HI>the shield of thy help, and the sword of thy excellency.</HI> And therefore, SIR, your tender re∣gards for us, and endeavour to make us still a more flourishing and happy people, will be an offering high∣ly acceptable to the LORD. A great opportunity is put into your hands to do us good; and we would hope it is because GOD <HI>loveth his people</HI> that he has set your EXCELLENCY over us in such a day and time as this: And that you will be the means of delivering us from the perplexing difficulties we are involved in, particu∣larly by an <HI>unhappy Medium,</HI> uncertain as the wind, and fluctuating like the waves of the sea, and which lies at the mercy of every one to rise or sink at his plea∣sure; thro' the <HI>unrighteousness</HI> whereof the land mourn∣eth; and the cries of many are going up into the ears of the LORD of <HI>Sabaoth.</HI></P>
<P>I would also humbly ask your EXCELLENCY'S smiles upon the COLLEGE, the chief seat of learning among us, the glory of NEW-ENGLAND; and especially at such a time as this, when learning is despised and vilified as a thing prejudicial to the church and state; whereas it is the honour and safety of both.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="005326_0047_1016FFE39AAA2430"/>
I would further humbly beseech your EXCELLENCY to use your best endeavours and influence at <HI>Home,</HI> to secure to us the many valuable <HI>privileges</HI> granted us by the ROYAL CHARTER: Your EXCELLENCY'S con∣cern and regard for us in these things, will further en∣dear you to us; and as it will render you worthy of the highest esteem, love and admiration of your people while you live, so your name will be mentioned with honour after your recess. With this consideration, <HI>Thetis</HI> comforts her brave son in <HI>Homer,</HI> that though he should be short lived, yet he should continue him∣self in the admiration of posterity; by this means, tho' you seek not glory to yourself, yet you shall <HI>obtain a good report,</HI> and your <HI>memory shall be blessed,</HI> when the <HI>memory of the wicked shall perish.</HI> But alas, what and how little is this compared with that honour, which CHRIST <HI>upon the throne</HI> will confer upon you, as a recompence to your fidelity in his service, and which infinitely transcends all the honours of this passing world, and shall last for ever.</P>
<P>I conclude with my earnest wishes, that the best of blessings may descend &amp; rest upon your EXCELLENCY'S <HI>person</HI> &amp; <HI>family</HI> to the period of a holy and happy life; and that you may be late transmitted to the blessed regions of immortality and glory above, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Permit me now to apply myself to the honourable COUNCIL, and the honourable house of REPRESEN∣TATIVES.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Thro' the good hand of our GOD upon us, you are met together to day to choose <HI>one branch</HI> of our legislature. Now there are <HI>two</HI> things that ought to govern you in your <HI>election;</HI> One is, the <HI>ability</HI> or
<PB N="49" REF="005326_0048_1016FFE681D423C0"/>
<HI>fitness</HI> of the person you vote for, that he is a man of good knowledge and wisdom, and a man of integrity; if he is defective in these, he is certainly destitute of the essential qualifications for government. The other is this, In your choice have a <HI>principal regard</HI> for the <HI>glory of</HI> CHRIST upon the throne, and the <HI>good of your Country;</HI> not to please men, but GOD; not to serve a party-spirit; not to gratify any one's ambition or humour; not from a contracted selfish principle: I hope, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> you will detest such low and sinister designs. Be pleased to think with yourselves, before you cast your <HI>vote,</HI> Will it be an act <HI>pleasing to the Lord</HI> CHRIST, that I hold up my hand, or give my vote for such a man? What is the <HI>principle</HI> that governs me in it? Is it because I think him the most capable, and best disposed to serve the publick? Or have I something else in view? Let not <HI>prejudice</HI> or <HI>affection</HI> turn the scale; and such a man be neglected or left out, because he is not in such a <HI>scheme</HI> or <HI>party,</HI> tho' otherwise well qualified; and another take place that is less worthy, because he has such a turn of thought, or is likely to serve such a design. It was once the complaint of a wise and political head, <HI>I am not able to bear this people myself alone;</HI> and it was good policy (and soon became sound divinity) which <HI>Jethro</HI> gave him, <HI>to take wise men, and under∣standing, and known among the tribes,</HI> and place such to be rulers. Never did the circumstances of this people call for more of the spirit of <HI>wisdom</HI> and <HI>know∣ledge, compassion</HI> &amp; <HI>integrity,</HI> than at this day: When the tide serves, the wind blows favourably, and all things make for the voyage, a less degree of skill may possibly suffice; but it requires an <HI>artist to steer in a storm.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="005326_0049_1016FFEAAC420C30"/>
And, <HI>honour'd Sirs,</HI> after the affair of this day is over, and the several <HI>branches</HI> of the <HI>legislature</HI> come to act in concert, it is to be desired, that you may all approve yourselves what by <HI>profession</HI> and <HI>character</HI> you are, the <HI>servants of the Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST; a title which no man has any cause to be ashamed of, and which no <HI>angel</HI> or <HI>arch-angel,</HI> but is fond of; and that you manifest your <HI>love</HI> and <HI>loyalty</HI> to him, in a <HI>resolute</HI> and <HI>vigorous opposition</HI> to every thing that tends to <HI>obstruct</HI> his interest, and the flourishing of religion in the truth and purity of it among us;—And in a solemn and reverend regard to the DAY, the <HI>house</HI> and <HI>worship</HI> of GOD, and that a proper care be taken to prevent the great and scandalous disorders that some are chargeable with in these respects. I am sensible there are good and wholesome laws provided, to oblige all persons to <HI>attend</HI> the publick worship, and to prevent <HI>unnecessary travels</HI> upon the SABBATH; but how little regard is paid to them? They are every day trampled on, and in the open face of some in authority, and yet there is little or no notice taken of it: This is <HI>an iniquity to be punished by the judges;</HI> but if the civil officer <HI>neglects his duty,</HI> the whole land becomes guilty and must suffer for it, for there needs nothing more to make a sin <HI>publick,</HI> than that it is connived at by those, in whose <HI>power alone</HI> it is to suppress it.</P>
<P>To draw to a close, Let us all <HI>practically acknow∣ledge the regency of</HI> CHRIST, and <HI>submit</HI> to all his <HI>claims</HI> and <HI>demands</HI> upon us. Our duty herein is too evident to be disputed, and the consequent advantage of it is a dignity and felicity beyond all expression, thought or parallel. HEAVEN, with all its charms
<PB N="51" REF="005326_0050_1016FFEC312CF188"/>
and delightful glory, will then be ours: After a short <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of service, we shall be admitted into his temple above, where our eyes shall see the KING, and behold the glory which the FATHER has given him, and <HI>be changed into the same image, from glory to glory:</HI> And as <HI>one star differs from another star in glory,</HI> so the <HI>rewards</HI> of blessedness shall be proportion'd to the <HI>de∣grees</HI> of our services here, and the honour done to GOD by them. Let these considerations inspire us with courage and resolution in the service of CHRIST; and let them be supporting considerations to us under all the sorrows of the present life. Here the <HI>believer</HI> is in armour and battel with the united powers of sin and hell, which furiously attack him; and he is almost worn out with the long and tedious conflict; and here he meets with numberless crosses and contradicti∣ons. Happy they, that are arrived at the heavenly world, and got above the reach of every thing that is grievous: <HI>Blessed are the dead, that die in the</HI> LORD: There the soul rests as in its <HI>proper centre,</HI> and desires nothing more than what it enjoys. But <HI>where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</HI> CHRIST <HI>upon the throne</HI> has power enough to condemn &amp; punish them; and will exert his power, as for the <HI>salvation</HI> of his willing people, so for the <HI>destruction</HI> of all his enemies. The sinner shall be shut out of his reviving presence, &amp; have no part in the honours of his throne, or the joys that flow from it: They that now refuse submission to his <HI>easy yoke,</HI> he will hereafter break with his <HI>iron rod;</HI> and the <HI>opposers of his person,</HI> shall be the <HI>victims of his justice,</HI> and the everlasting monuments of his <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>vengeance.</HI> Sinners are apt to forget CHRIST in his exalted state; they look rather upon his past life, his low and mean condition, and are fearless of any
<PB N="52" REF="005326_0051_1016FFEF0CC77FE8"/>
harm from one so degraded: They slight his threats, &amp; seem to question his ability to execute them, but they will feel the dismal effects of them, to their everlasting confusion.—<HI>Who hath ever harden'd himself against GOD, and prospered?</HI> He can crush the daring rebel with greater ease than we can the feeble worm: To allude to Job 41. 20. <HI>Out of his mouth goeth a flame; when he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid.—He is a king over all the children of pride.</HI> There is not any creature <HI>that has an arm as GOD;</HI> or,<HI>that can thunder with a voice like him?</HI> What is the chaff be∣fore the strong wind, or briars and thorns to the raging fire? No more is the sinner in his hand: He that triumphed over all the powers of hell, when set in battel array against him, can easily conquer the sinner when he presumes to enter the lists with him. He decks himself with majesty and excellency, and arays himself with glory and beauty; he casts abroad the rage of his wrath; beholds every one that is proud, and abases him; looks upon him, and brings him low, and treads the wicked under his feet; he girdeth him∣self with strength unto battel, pursues his enemies and overtakes them, as he did the <HI>Egyptian</HI> host, in their pursuit of <HI>Israel,</HI> neither doth he turn again 'till they are consumed. Sinners are but plotting mischief a∣gainst themselves, and paving the way to their own destruction, when they are regardless of his laws, and trample his authority under their feet: They may think they act wisely for themselves; but they shall find it otherwise, repent their choice and upbraid their folly when it is too late, and they shall come to <HI>drink of the wine of the wrath of GOD, which is pour∣ed out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;</HI> and shall be <HI>tormented with fire and brimstone, in the
<PB N="53" REF="005326_0052_1016FFF0A2348BC8"/>
presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the lamb.</HI> This, Oh sinner, will be thy fate unless thou art wise betimes to make thy peace with the SON of GOD. 'Tis to be earnestly wished, that every poor and perishing soul would be persuaded to submit to CHRIST, accept him as his LORD, open his heart, and invite him to come in, and be willing to let <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>self,</HI> and all, go to make room for <HI>him.</HI> And let us all express our loyalty to CHRIST by our <HI>submission to our civil rulers,</HI> who bear the title of GODS, and are invested with someting of <HI>his</HI> authority. He requires us to <HI>render to all their dues,</HI> and <HI>to be subject to the higher powers for conscience sake:</HI> If we do these things and <HI>render unto GOD the things that are GOD's,</HI> and <HI>to</HI> Caesar <HI>the things that are</HI> Caesar'<HI>s,</HI> then we shall enjoy that blessed calm in our own breasts, which arises from a sense that we have done our duty, while we live, and shall have an happy translation after death, from a world of sin, of snares and sorrows, to immor∣tality and peace, happiness and glory, with GOD and CHRIST above.</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us all unite in fervent supplica∣tion to GOD <HI>upon the throne,</HI> for his blessing upon the <HI>province,</HI> That he would pardon all the sins of it, according to the greatness of his mercy; and reform every disorder among us: And, that the <HI>hope of Israel</HI> may be our GOD and SAVIOUR, and not as a stranger in our land, or a way-faring man that turns aside to tarry but for a night; but that he would be always in the midst of us, and in this day of <HI>war</HI> and <HI>battle</HI> be as a <HI>wall of fire around us,</HI> and <HI>appoint salvation to us for walls and bulwarks:</HI> That he would bless all <HI>orders</HI> and <HI>degrees</HI> of men among us; and make our
<PB N="54" REF="005326_0053_1016FFF261D0A978"/>
<HI>officers</HI> peace, and our <HI>exactors</HI> righteousness: And, that the affairs of <HI>this day</HI> may be over-rul'd to his glory and the best good of this people: And particu∣larly let this be your united supplication, my <HI>fathers</HI> and <HI>brethren</HI> in the ministry, which was the original design of your <HI>convention</HI> upon this <HI>anniversary</HI> occasion.</P>
<P>And now, May the GOD of peace and grace be with us, and do for us, and for this whole people, exceeding abundantly above all that we are able to ask or think; and may our hearts be perfect with the LORD our GOD, all our days, and may it be well with us for ever; for the sake of JESUS CHRIST, to whom with the FATHER, and the blessed SPIRIT, be ascribed, as is most due, all honour and praise, might, majesty and dominion, both now, henceforth, and in eternal ages.</P>
