<HEAD>THE PREFACE:</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Reader must not expect in the following Sheets, a particular and minute Relation of every Formality, Question and Answer that pass'd upon the Trials, it may suffice, if he be assured he has the Substance; for indeed more cannot be expected, when it is considered, that we have no One here, as in our Mother Country, who make it a Business to take Notes upon such Occasions; or any others, that we know of, who are so dexterous at Short-Hand, as to be sufficiently qualified for such a Purpose; but he will be sure to have all that could be collected from the Notes that were taken by the Court, and Gentlemen at the Bar; with all which the Compiler has been furnished.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Upon a Review of the Proceedings, in order for this Undertaking, the Bulk of them, which was the Product of about</HI> Six Months Enquiry, <HI>seem'd somewhat discouraging: No doubt, they might have been conracted, if this Work had been proceeded upon in the Method of an Historical Relation only, wherein the Compiler would have been more at Liberty to abstract the several Originals; but it was concluded,</HI> a Journal <HI>would give more Satisfaction, inasmuch as in such a kind of Process, the Depositions and Examinations themselves, which were the Ground-work of the Pro∣ceedings, would appear at large; which most probably would afford Conviction, to such as have a Disposition to be convinc'd, and have</HI> in Reality <HI>doubted, whether any par∣ticular Convicts had Justice done them or not, notwithstanding they had the Oppor∣tunity of</HI> seeing <HI>and</HI> hearing <HI>a great deal concerning them; and others, who had not such Opportunities, who were prejudiced at a Distance in their Disfavour, by frivolous Reports, might the readier be undeceiv'd: For as the Proceedings are set forth in the Order of Time they were produced, the Reader will thereby be furnished with the most natural View of the Whole; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e better enabled to conceive the Design and dangerous Depth of this</HI> hellish Project, <HI>as well as the Justice of the several Prosecutions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus far, however, the Compiler thinks proper to premise, that as he found it convenient to divide the Originals into number'd Sections, for the more ready Reference to the several Parts of them, as Occasion should offer; he took the Liberty also of lopping off from them, what, in print, he thought would be a superfluous Formality, such as</HI> The Deponent further saith, <HI>and such like, which he thought would have been a needless Incumbrance to the Book.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="005413_0003_101739270FE1B838"/>
<HI>The Parties accused of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were numerous, and Business by Degrees multiplied so fast upon the Grand Jury,</HI> which bore the Burthen of this Enquiry, <HI>that there would have been an immediate Necessity for others to have lent a helping Hand in taking Examinations</HI> from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Beginning, <HI>if the Judges had not found it expedient to examine the Persons accused, upon their first taking into Custody, whereby it seemed most likely the Truth would bolt out, before they had Time to cool, or Opportunity of discoursing in the Jail with their Confederates who were before committed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Examinations thus taken by the Judges, were soon after laid before the Grand Jury, who interrogated the Parties therefrom in such manner, as generally produced from them the Substance of the same Matter, and often something more, by which Means there accrued no small Advantage; for though where the last Examination brought to light new Discovery, yet it will be seldom found, there is any Thing in such further Examinations contradictory to the former, but generally a Confirmation of them; and in such Case, the setting forth the same at large, may not be thought a useless Tautology; not that this will happen often, and where it does, 'twill be chiefly found in the Examinations and Confessions of Negroes, who, in ordinary Cases, are seldom found to hold twice in the same Story; which, for its Rarety therefore, if it carried not with it the additional Weight of the greater Appearance of Truth, may make this Particular the more excusable; and further, this is</HI> a Diary <HI>of the Proceed∣ings, that is to be exhibited; therefore, in Conformity to that Plan, Nothing should be omitted, which may be of any Use.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All proper Precautions were taken by the Judges, that the Criminals should be kept separate; and they were so as much as the scanty Room in the Jail would admit of; and new Appartments were accordingly fitted up for their Reception: But more particular Care was taken, that such Negroes as had made Confession and Discovery, and were to be made Use of as Witnesses, should be kept a-part from the rest, and as much from each other, as the Accommodations would allow of, in order to prevent their caballing together; and the Witnesses were always examined a-part from each other first, as well upon the Trials, as otherwise, and then generally confronted with the Persons they accused, who were usually sent for and taken into Custody upon such Examinations, if they were to be met with; which was the Means of bringing many others to a Confession, as well such as were newly taken up, as those who had long before been committed, perhaps upon slighter Grounds, and had insisted upon their Innocence; for they had generally the Cunning not to own their Guilt, 'til they knew their Accusers: But notwithstanding this was the ordinary Method taken, both by the Judges and Grand Jury, to send for the Parties as soon as impeached, (which however might sometimes through Hurry be omitted) yet several who happen'd
<PB N="iii" REF="005413_0004_1017392893908F68"/>
then to be out of the Way, were afterwards forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and slipt through our Fingers, from the Multiplicity of Business in Hand, as will hereafter appear; which</HI> therefore <HI>is particularly recommended to the Notice of their Owners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Trouble of examining Criminals in general, may be easily guess'd at; but the Fatigue in that of Negroes, is not to be conceived, but by those that have undergone the Drudgery: The Difficulty of bringing, and holding them to the Truth, if by Chance it starts from them, is not to be surmounted but by the closest Attention; many of them have a great deal of Craft; their unintelligible Jargon stands them in great Stead, to conceal their Meaning; so that an Examiner must expect to encounter with much Perplexity; grope through a Maze of Obscurity; be obliged to lay hold of broken Hints, lay them carefully together, and thoroughly weigh and compare them with each other, before he can be able to see the Light, or fix those Creatures to any certain determinate Meaning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Though for the Reasons before mentioned, all the Trials could not be set forth at large; yet on the principal Trials, such as,</HI> The Hughsons, Ury the Priest, Quack and Cuffee, <HI>(the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first Negroes executed for the Conspiracy) and that of</HI> the five Spanish Slaves, <HI>the Court and Gentlemen at the Bar, took Notes more largely; but as to the rest, though there were here and there some Minutes taken, (which are also set forth in their proper Places) yet they did not think them equally worth the Pains; therefore upon other Trials, the Paragraphs or Sections of the Depositions of Whites, and the Examinations and Confessions of Slaves, taken by the Judges, Grand Jury, or others, upon the Credit whereof such Slaves were indicted, are referred to upon their respective Trials: Which Method, if any should object to, as subject to Uncertainty, and say, the Witnesses might not declare exactly the same Things, and in the same Words, or the Substance of them, before the Court, as are contained in those Depositions, Examinations and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fessions referred to; the Answer is,</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>'Tis most likely they did not, (nor could it be expected they should) deliver themselves precisely in the same Words: But Abstracts were taken of those Evidences, and Briefs prepared for the Council concern'd in each Trial, pointing out the several Articles affecting each Criminal; whereby the Council were readily led to ask a Witness such Questions as would naturally draw out the Substance of the same Matter in Answer, if it were the Truth; and it was observed by those more immediately concerned in these Affairs, and whose Province it was to give close Attention to them, that the Witnesses both Whites and Blacks, generally kept close to the Text, and delivered in Court the Substance of the Evidence they had before given in their Depositions, Examinations, and Confessions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="005413_0005_1017392BB1333ED0"/>
Secondly, <HI>That what the Witnesses did actualy declare in Court upon the Trials, was sufficient to convince</HI> twelve <HI>honest Men upon their Oaths, that the Accused were guilty; and there is no other Way left to furnish the Reader with the Grounds which gave such Conviction to the Juries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For the further</HI> enlightening <HI>the Masters and Owners of Slaves accused, convicted upon their own Confessions, and transported, and of others who were discharged from Confinement,</HI> (for want of sufficient Evidence, as 'twas said, before THE SECOND GRAND JURY, who were charged to continue the Enquiry concerning this infernal Scheme) <HI>the Evidence affecting each, is referr'd to under every such Negro's Con∣fession, excepting as to such of them as were made Use of as Witnesses, which was thought needless; for their Testimony having gained sufficient Credit, it can scarce be supposed there will be any Doubt of their own Guilt: But if there should be any who hesitate concerning it, all that can be said, is, it will behove such to give the closer Attention to the several Depositions, Examinations and Confessions, which impeach them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Evidence likewise affecting each White Person apprehended upon the Account of this Conspiracy, that was afterwards discharged for want of Prosecution, is referred to under their respective Names, that it may appear what Reason there was for their Commitment and Accusation, tho' they were discharged for Want of Indictment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It has been thought proper to add, at the End of this Journal, Lists of all the Whites and Blacks accused of this Conspiracy, those who were executed, and those who were pardoned upon Condition of Transportation, or otherwise discharged from Jail, shewing the respective Times of their Commitment, Arraignment, Conviction, Execution or Discharge; whereby the Reader will be enabled to turn to almost any Part of the Journal to satisfy his Curiosity, as to what most materialy concerns each respective Conspirator; and with a View also to shew to what Places such of them as were transported (according to Information received) were shipp'd; which is premised, as a modest Hint to our Brethren in the</HI> West-Indies, <HI>and the more neighbouring English Colonies, that they may see how tender we have been of</HI> their <HI>Peace and Security, by using all the Precaution in our Power,</HI> that none of our Rogues should be imposed upon them; <HI>for it was made an express Condition in the several Pardons, and likewise the Recognizances entered into by the Securities for Slaves transported,</HI> <Q><HI>That the Persons pardoned should be transported to the Dominion of some foreign Prince or State or the Island of</HI> Newfoundland <HI>[by a time therein limitted] and if any of the Negroes or Slaves [pardoned by the Letters Patent] should at any Time after [the Day therein limitted]</HI> be found in any of his Majesty's Dominions, <HI>except</HI> New∣foundland, <HI>the Letters Patent as to all and every the Person and Persons so found,
<PB N="v" REF="005413_0006_1017392F14E8D438"/>
should be null, void, and of no Force or Effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Which Terms have been strictly pursued and complied with, some few Instances only excepted.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Many, it seems, have wondered, that this Journal has not made its Appearance long ago; for, say they, the Thing dies away, and is almost forgotten (the more's the Pity) and now People will hardly take the Pains to give it a Perusal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To which it is answered; That it was some Time before the Compiler could submit himself to undergo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Drudgery of this kind, for several Reasons, the Task was not very inviting, and he had borne a sufficient Fatigue, under an ill State of Health, in the Share he had in the Proceedings themselves, for a Course of six Months daily Attendance, and it was some Time before he could absolutely determine to undertake it, and did set about it in earnest; and since that, the Duties of his Offices and Profession have occasioned many Interruptions; and when the Attention is withdrawn for a Time from a Subject, it may not always suit the Humour to re-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssume it, especially a Matter of this Nature; nor perhaps can the Thoughts concerning it be easily collected again; not that this Business required much Intention, but Recollection and Care were necessary to introduce every Matter properly and give it Connexion in its due Order of Time, towards which the Compiler had the advantage of being all along privy to the Proceedings, and all the Motions concerning them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There were Reasons indeed, for making these Matters publick, which could not be withstood.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There had been some wanton, wrong-headed Persons amongst us, who took the Liberty to arraign the Justice of the Proceedings, and set up their private Opinions in Superiority to the Court and Grand Jury; tho' God knows (and all Men of Sense know) they could not be Judges of such Matters; but nevertheless, they declared with no small Assurance (notwithstanding what we</HI> saw <HI>with our Eyes, and</HI> heard <HI>with our Ears, and every one might have judg'd of by his Intellects, that had any)</HI> That there was no Plot at all! <HI>The Inference</HI> such <HI>would have drawn from thence, is too obvious to need mentioning: However this moved very little: It was not to</HI> convince <HI>(for that would have been a vain Undertaking;</HI> the AEthiopian might as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon change his Skin) <HI>much less was it to gratify</HI> such.</P>
<P><HI>But there were two Motives which weighed much; the</HI> one, <HI>that those who had not the Opportunity of</HI> seeing <HI>and</HI> hearing, <HI>might judge of the Justice of the Proceed∣ings from the State of the Case being laid before them; the</HI> other, <HI>that from thence the People in general, might be persuaded of the Necessity there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for every One that has Negroes, to keep a very watchful Eye over them, and not to indulge them with too great Liberties, which we find they make Use of to the worst Purposes, caballing
<PB N="vi" REF="005413_0007_101739338A308158"/>
and confederating together <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in great Numbers, when they may, from the Accounts in the ensuing Sheets, from what they</HI> see <HI>has happen'd,</HI> feel <HI>the Consequence of giving them so great a Latitude, as has been customary within this City and Province, and thereby be warned to keep themselves upon a strict Guard against</HI> these Enemies of their own Houshold, <HI>since we know what they are capable of; for it was notorious, that those among them, who had the kindest Masters, who fared best, and had the most Liberty; nay, that those in whom their Masters placed the greatest Confidence, insomuch, that they would even have put their own Swords into their Hands, in Expectation of being defended by them against their own Colour, did nevertheless turn out the greatest Villains: It even appeared, that these</HI> head Fellows <HI>boasted of</HI> their Superiority <HI>over the more harmless and inoffensive; that they held them in an Inferiority and Dependence, a kind of Subjection, as if they had got such Dominion over them,</HI> that they durst not, at any Time, or upon any Occasion, but do as they would have them; <HI>from whence it may be guessed, how likely the Defection was to be general.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The principal Inducement, therefore, to this Undertaking, was,</HI> the publick Benefit; <HI>that those who have Property in Slaves, might have a lasting Memento concerning the Nature of them; that they may be thence warned to keep a constant Guard over them; since what they have done, they may one Time or other act over again; especially if there should in future Times, appear,</HI> such Monsters in Nature, <HI>as the</HI> Hughsons, Ury the Priest; and such like, <HI>who dare be so wicked as to attempt the seducing them to such execrable Purposes: And if any should think it not worth their While to learn from the ensuing Sheets (what by others perhaps may be esteemed)</HI> a useful Lesson, <HI>the Fault will be their own; and realy it was thought</HI> necessary, <HI>for these and other Reasons needless here to mention, that there should be a standing Memorial of so unprecedented a Scheme of Villainy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But though the Compiler was willing to make an Offering of his</HI> own Time, <HI>to the Publick Service, by laying these Matters in Order, for the Press; yet being under no other Influence so to do, than his Inclination and Readiness to oblige the Publick, he was at Liberty however to suit his own Convenience; and therefore, considering the Multiplicity of the Proceedings, it may,</HI> after all, <HI>rather be thought,</HI> Matter of Wonder, <HI>that it makes its Appearance so soon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perhaps it may not come forth</HI> unseasonably <HI>at this</HI> Juncture, <HI>if the Distractions occasioned by this</HI> Mystery of Iniquity, <HI>may be thereby so revived in our Memories, as to awaken us from that supine Security, which again too generally prevails, and put us upon our Guard, lest the Enemy should be yet within our Doors.</HI></P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S a Robbery committed at Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s pav'd the Way to the Discovery of the Conspiracy, it may not be improper to introduce the ensuing JOURNAL and NARRATIVE with an Account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Felony, as well as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fires which alarmed this City, close upon the Heels of each other, within less than three Weeks, occasion'd by this infernal Scheme▪ 'till they both came under the Enquiry and Examination of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nd Jury,</HI> at the Supreme Court: And indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> such a close Connexion between this Felony, and the Conspiracy, as will appear by the several Steps and Examinations taken by Occasion of the former, that the Narrative of the Robbery could not well be omitted; for the Enquiry concerning that, was the Means of drawing out the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st Hint con∣cerning the other; nay, this Felony and such like, were actually Ingredients of the Conspiracy, as will appear by the Sequel.</P>
<P>On Saturday Night the 28th <HI>February,</HI> 1740-1, a Robbery was committed at the House of Mr. ROBERT HOGG, in the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> Merchant, from whence were taken diverse Pieces of Linnen and other Goods, and several Silver Coins, chiefly Spanish, and Medals, and wrought Silver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Value in the Whole of <HI>Sixty Pounds</HI> and upwards.</P>
<P>The Occasion of this Robbery, as was discovered, and will appear more fully hereafter, was one <HI>Wilson,</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad of about seventeen or eighteen Years of Age, belonging to the <HI>Flamborough</HI> Man of War, on this Station; who having Acquaintance with two white Servants belonging to Gentlemen who lodged at Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s House, <HI>Wilson</HI> used frequently to come thither on that Pretence, which gained him easy Admittance: But <HI>Wilson,</HI> it seems, had a more familiar Acquaintance with some Negroes of very suspicious Characters, particularly <HI>Caesar,</HI> belonging to <HI>John Vaarck,</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ker; <HI>Prince,</HI> to Mr. <HI>John Auboyneau,</HI> Merchant, and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> to <HI>Adolph Philipse,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR></P>
<Q>The Thursday before this Robbery was committed, <HI>Wilson</HI> came to Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Shop with one of the Man-of-War's People, to buy some checqued Linnen; and having bargained for some, Part of the Money offered in Payment was of Spanish Coin; and Mrs. <HI>Hogg</HI> opening her Bureau to change the Money, pulled out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Drawer in the View of <HI>Wilson,</HI> wherein were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> con∣siderable Quantity of mill'd Spanish Pieces of Eight: She soon reflected that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had done wrong in exposing her Money to an idle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in that manner, who came so frequently to her House, and immediately shut up the Bureau again, and made a Pretence of sending the Money out to a Neighbour's to be weighed.</Q>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Apprehensions happened to be right; for this Boy having a Sight of the Money, was charmed with it, and, as it seems, wanted to be fingering of it; he told his Comrades of the Black-Guard, the before named <HI>Caesar, Prince</HI> and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> where they might have a fine Booty, if they could manage cleverly to come at it; he said, it was at <HI>Hogg'</HI>s House in the Broad-Street; his Wife kept a Shop of Goods, and sold Candles, Rum and Molasses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Negroes catched at the Proposal, and the Scheme was communicated by them to <HI>John Hughson,</HI> who kept a Publick House by the North River in this City, a Place where Numbers of Negroes used to resort, and be entertained privately (in Defiance of the Law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) at all Hours, as ap∣peared afterwards, and will be shewn at large in the ensuing Sheets: Thither they used to bring such Goods as they stole from their Masters or others, and <HI>Hughson,</HI> his Wife and Family, received them: There they held a Con∣sultation with <HI>Hughson</HI> and his Family, how they should act in order to compass the Attainment of this Booty.</P>
<P>The Boy <HI>(Wilson)</HI> told them the Situation of the House and Shop; that the Front was towards Broad-Street; that there was a Side Door out of the Shop into a little Lane, commonly called the Jews-Alley, and if they could contrive an Errand thither to buy Rum, they might take an
<PB N="2" REF="005413_0009_10173936BB73AE48"/>
Opportunity to shove back the Bolt of the Door facing the Alley, for there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Lock to it, and then they could come in the Night afterwards, and accomplish their Designs.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>At Nights they usually let People in at the Front Door in the other Street, and went thro' the Parlour to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which</HI> Wilson <HI>well knew.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>At <HI>Hughson'</HI>s lodged one <HI>Margaret Sorubiero,</HI> alias <HI>Salingburgh,</HI> alias <HI>Kerry</HI> commonly called <HI>Peggy,</HI> or the <HI>Newfoundland Irish Beauty,</HI> a young Woman about One or Two and Twenty; she pretended to be married, but no Husband appeared; she was a Person of infamous Character, a notorious Prostitute, and also of the worst Sort, a Pro∣stitute to Negroes; she was here lodged and supported by <HI>Caesar (Vaarck'</HI>s) before mentioned, and took Share (in common with <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Family) of the Spoils and Plunder, the Effects of <HI>Caesar'</HI>s Thesis, which he brought to <HI>Hugh∣son'</HI>s; and she may be supposed to have been in most of their wicked Secrets: for she had lodged there the Summer before, and removed from thence to a House by the New Battery, near one <HI>John Romme'</HI>s, a Shoemaker, and was well acquainted with him and his Wife: Thither also <HI>Caesar</HI> used frequently to resort, with many other Negroes; thither he also conveyed stolen Goods, and some Part of <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Goods, of which <HI>John Romme</HI> had his Choice, if what <HI>Caesar</HI> said, after his Condemnation, be true: and by what will appear hereafter against <HI>Romme,</HI> and from his Intimacy with <HI>Hughson,</HI> his Merits may be concluded to fall little short of his Companions.</P>

<P>The Deputy Town Clerk, when <HI>Mary Burton</HI> was under Examination, as he was taking her Deposition, exhorted her to speak the Truth, and all she knew of the Matter; she answered him, <HI>That she ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dly dared to speak, she was so much afraid she should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e murdered by them;</HI> or Words to that Purpose: Whereupon the Clerk moved the Justices, that she might be taken Care of, not knowing that she had been removed from her Master's the Night before, by Order of a Magistrate.</P>

<HEAD>WEDNESDAY, 18th MARCH.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT One o'Clock this Day a Fire broke out of the Roof of his Majesty's House at <HI>Fort George,</HI> within this City, near the Chappel: When the Alarm of a Fire was first given, it was observed from the Town, that the Middle of the Roof was in a great Smoke, but not a Spark of Fire appeared on the Out-side for a considerable Time; and when it first broke out, it was on the East Side, about Twenty Feet from the End next the Chappel, and in a short Time afterwards, it made it's Way through the Roof in several Places, at a Distance from the First, and each other. Upon the Chappel Bell's ringing, great Numbers of People, Gentlemen and others, came to the Assistance of the Lieu∣tenant Governor and his Family; and as the People of this City, to do them Justice, are very active and diligent upon these Occasions, most of the Houshold Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were removed out and saved, and the Fire Engines were in a little Time brought thither; but the Wind blowing a vio∣lent Gale at S. E. as soon as the Fire appeared in different Places of the Roof, it was judged impossible to save the House and Chappel; so that Endeavours were used to save the Secretary's Office over the Fort Gate, where the Records of the Colony were reposited; and also the Barracks which stood on the Side of the Quadrangle opposite to the House; such Diligence was used in removing the Records, Books and Papers from the Former, many of which for Dispatch were thrown out of the Windows next the Town, that most of them were preserved; and though, from the Violence of the Wind, the Papers were blown about the Streets, we don't hear that any very material Writings were lost; but the Fire had got hold of the Roof of the Office soon after they began to remove the Records, and though the Engines played some time upon it and afterwards upon the Barracks, they were of little Service, the Wind blowing very hard, and the Flames of the House being so near them, all seemed to be at their Mercy; and an Alarm being given that there was Gun-Powder in the Fort, whether through Fear and an Apprehension that there was, or whether the Hint was given by some of the Conspirators themselves, with artful Design to intimidate the People, and frighten them from giving further Assistance, we cannot say; though the Lieu∣tenant Governor declared to every Body, that there was none there; yet they had not the Courage to depend upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Honour's Assurance: But however, it happened, most of them deserted it, 'till they found that many Gentlemen remained upon the Spot; though, had they all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ayed, it was thought it would have been to little Purpose; for such was the Violence of the Wind, and the Flames spread so fast, that, in about an Hour and a Quarter's Time, the House was burnt down to the Ground, and the Chappel and other Buildings beyond human Power of saving any material Part of them: At length the Fire got to the Stables without the Fort, and the Wind blew fired Shingles upon the Houses in the Town next the North River, so that there was the utmost Danger of its spreading further; which occasioned many Families to remove their Goods; but at last it was stopp'd at the Governor's Stables, with very little Damage to the Houses in the Town.</P>
<P>While the Records were removing from the Secretary's Office, there fell a moderate Shower of Rain, which was of some small Service; and when the Buildings were down to the Ground Floor, some Hand Gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shells, which had lain so long as to be forgotten, took Fire, and went off, which few or none but the Officers of the Fort, could ac∣count for, or imagine what was the Matter; nor would it have been worth while to have attempted their Removal, if they had been thought of; for the Buildings in the Fort were at that time all given over for lost; but this served to con∣firm the Generality of the People in the Notion, that there was Powder in the Fort, and if they could have done any good, this would probably have prevented them.</P>
<P>But though the Floors of the several Buildings soon tum∣bled in, there were many Pieces of Timber which were laid in the Walls of the House, Chappel Steeple, and other Buildings, which continued burning almost all the Night after; so that we could not think the Town quite out of Danger of further Mischief, 'till those Timbers were en∣tirely consumed; for 'twas apprehended, as the Fort stood upon an Eminence, that the Wind according as it should have happened to change, might have blown some of the Fire upon the Houses in the Town, which, for the most Part, have shingled Roofs; therefore Care was taken to keep a watchful Guard all the Night to prevent further Da∣mage.</P>

Mr. <HI>Cornelius Van Horne,</HI> a Captain of one of the Companies of the Militia, very providently beat to Arms in the Evening, and drew out his Men with all Expedition; had Seventy odd of them under Arms all Night, and Par∣ties of them continually going the Rounds of the City, 'till Day-Light: This Incident, from what will appear here∣after, may be thought to have been a very fortunate One, and deserving of a more particular Remark, though at that time <HI>some People were so infatuated, as to reproach that Gen∣tleman for it, as a Madman.</HI></P>
<P>The only Way of accounting for this Misfortune at this Time was, The Lieutenant Governor had ordered a Plum∣mer that Morning to mend a Leak in the Gutter between the House and the Chappel, which joined upon one an∣other, and the Man carrying his Fire-Pot with Coals to keep his Soddering-Iron hot, to perform his Work; and the Wind setting into the Gutter, 'twas thought, some Sparks had been blown out upon the Shingles of the House; but some People having observed, that upon the first Alarm, as before, near half the Roof, as they guessed, was covered with Smoke, and that no Spark of Fire appeared without, nor could any be seen, but within; it was by them con∣cluded, that the Reason assigned was not likely to be the right One, especially when it was considered, that at length, the Fire broke out in several Places of the Roof, distant from each other; but no one imagined it was done on Pur∣pose.</P>

<P>ANOTHER Week from the Last, a Fire broke out at the Storehouse of Mr. <HI>Van Zant,</HI> towards the East End of the Town.

<P>As the People were returning from <HI>Quick'</HI>s Fire, that was succeeded with a Second Cry of <HI>Fire,</HI> at the House of one <HI>Ben Thomas,</HI> next Door to Captain <HI>Sarly,</HI> on the West Side: this was in the Dusk of the Evening.

<P>A Discovery was made in the Morning early, that some Coals had been put under a Haystack, standing near the Coach-House and Stables of <HI>Joseph Murray,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> in the Broad Way, and near some Dwelling Houses there, which had it them Fire, would have been in great Danger;
<PB N="7" REF="005413_0014_10173946B2B4AAC8"/>
but the Coals went out of themselves, as supposed, having only singed some Part of the Hay. It was said, there were Coals and Ashes traced along from the Fence to a neighbour∣ing House next adjoining the Stables, which caused a Suspi∣cion of the Negro that lived there.</P>
<P>The <HI>five</HI> several Fires, <HI>viz.</HI> at the <HI>Fort,</HI> Capt. <HI>Warren'</HI>s House, <HI>Van Zant'</HI>s Storehouse, <HI>Quick'</HI>s Stable, and <HI>Ben Thomas'</HI>s Kitchen, having happened in so short a Time, succeeding each other; and the Attempt made of a Sixth on Mr. <HI>Murray'</HI>s Haystack; it was natural for People of any Reflection, to conclude that the Fire was set on Purpose, by a Combination of Villians; and therefore occasioned great Uneasiness to every one that had Thought: But upon this Supposition, no Body imagined there could be any further Design, than for some wicked Wretches to have the Oppor∣tunity of making Prey of their Neighbours Goods, under Pretence of Assistance in removing them for Security, from the Danger of the Flames; for upon these late Instances, many of the Sufferers had complained of great Losses of their Goods and Furniture, which had been removed from their Houses upon these Occasions.</P>
<P>This Sunday as three Negroes were walking up the Broad-Way towards the <HI>English</HI> Church, about Service Time, Mrs. <HI>Earle</HI> looking out of her Window, overheard one of them saying to his Companions, with a vapouring Sort of an Air, <Q><HI>Fire, Fire, Scorch, Scorch,</HI> A LITTLE,—<HI>Damn it,</HI> BY-AND-BY,</Q> and then threw up his Hands, and laughed: The Woman conceived great Jealousy at these Words, and thought it very odd Behaviour at that Juncture, considering what had so lately happened; and she putting the natural Construction upon them, her Apprehen∣sions made her uneasy, and she immediately spoke of it to her next Neighbour Mrs. <HI>George,</HI> but said, <HI>she did not know any of the Negroes.</HI></P>
<P>About an▪ Hour after, when Church was out, Mrs. <HI>Earle</HI> saw the same Negroes coming down the Broad-Way again, and pointed out to Mrs. <HI>George</HI> the Person who had spoke the Words; and Mrs. <HI>George</HI> knew him, and said, <HI>That is Mr.</HI> WALTER'<HI>s Quaco.</HI></P>
<P>These Words, and the Airs and Graces given them by <HI>Quaco</HI> when he uttered them, were made known to a neighbouring Alderman, who informed the rest of the Justices thereof at their Meeting the next Day.</P>

<HEAD>MONDAY, 6th APRIL.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT Ten o'Clock in the Morning, there was an Alarm of a Fire at the House of Serjeant <HI>Burns,</HI> opposite the Fort Garden: This, 'twas said, was only a Chimney; which, upon Enquiry, the Man declared, had been swept the <HI>Friday</HI> before; but from the great Smother in the House, and some other Circumstances; there were Grounds to suspect a villainous Design in it.</P>
<P>Towards Noon, a Fire broke out in the Roof of Mrs. <HI>Hilton'</HI>s House, at the Corner of the Buildings next the Fly Market, adjoining on the East Side of Capt. <HI>Sarly'</HI>s House: It first broke out on that Side next <HI>Sarly'</HI>s; but being timely discovered, was soon prevented doing much, Mischief, more than burning Part of the Shingles of the Roof. Upon View, it was plain, that the Fire must have been purposely laid on the Wall-plate adjoining to the Shingle Roof; for a Hole bad been burnt deep in it, next that Part of the Roof where the Fire had taken hold of the Shingles; and it was suspected, that the Fire had been wrapt in a Bundle of Tow, for some was found near the Place: Thus the Fact was plain, but who did it, was a Question remained to be determined: But there was a Cry among the People, <HI>The Spanish Negroes; The Spanish Negroes; Take up the Spanish Negroes.</HI> The Occasion of this was the two Fires (<HI>Thomas'</HI>s and <HI>Hilton'</HI>s) happening so closely together, only one Day intervening, on each Side of Capt. <HI>Sarly'</HI>s House; and it being known, that <HI>Sarly</HI> had purchased a Spanish Negro, some Time before brought into this Port, among several others, in a Prize taken by Capt. <HI>Lush;</HI> all which Negroes were condemned as Slave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Court of Admiralty, and sold accordingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and that they afterwards pretending to have been Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their own Country, began to grumble at their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Usage of being sold as Slaves: This probably gave Rise to the Suspicion, that this Negro, out of Revenge, had been the Instrument of these two Fires: and he behaving himself insolently upon some People's asking him Question<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerning them, which signified their Distrust; it was told to a Magistrate who was near, and he order'd him to Goal, and also gave Direction to the Constables to commit all the Rest of that Cargo, in order for their safe Custody and Examination.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Magistrates met at the City-Hall, with Intent to examine them; and while the Justices were proceeding to Examination, about Four o'Clock there was another Alarm of Fire: Upon Enquiry, and looking out of the Hall Windows, it was seen from thence, and found to be at Col. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Storehouse. Upon the View of it, there was a small Streak of Fire running up the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like Wild-fire, from near the Bottom to the Top of the Roof, on the Side directly <HI>against the Wind as it then blow:</HI> It not being far from the Engines, they were instantly brought to the Place: and the Fire, to one's great Surprize, almost assoon extinguished. This was the Middlemost of three large Storehouses next each other in a Row, old
<PB N="8" REF="005413_0015_10173948D4E17968"/>
Timber-Buildings, and the Shingles burn'd like Tinder. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Storehouses were not inhabited, nor had they a Chimney in them, but were at a great Distance from any. The Fire upon Examination, must have begun within Side; for between the Side of those Storehouses, and the Houses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, opposite to the Wind, there was a large Space of Garden Ground; so that no Sparks from these Chimneys could have occasion'd this Mischief, had the Wind blown the contrary Way; but to discover by whom the Fire was put, was the Difficulty.</P>
<P>While the People were extinguishing the Fire at this Storehouse, and had almost mastered it, there was another <HI>Cry of Fire;</HI> which diverted the People attending the Storehouse, to the new Alarm, very few remaining behind: But a Man who had been on the Top of the House, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in extinguishing the Fire, saw a Negro leap out at the End Window of one of them, from thence making over several Garden-Fences in great Haste; which occa∣sion'd him to cry out, <HI>A Negro, A Negro;</HI> and that was soon improved into an Alarm, <HI>That the Negroes were rising:</HI> The Negro made very good Speed home to his Master's; he was generally known; and the Swiftness of his Flight occasioned his being remark'd; though scarce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knew the Reason, but a few which remained at the Storehouse, why the Word was given, <HI>A Negro, A Negro:</HI> It was immediately changed into <HI>Cuff Philipse, Cuff Philipse:</HI> The People ran to Mr. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s House in Quest of him; he was got in at the Back-Door; and being found, was dragged out of the House, and carried to Goal, borne upon the People's Shoulders. He was a Fellow of general ill Character; his Master being a single Man and little at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Cuff</HI> had a great deal of idle Time, which, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he employed to very ill Purposes, and had acquired a general bad Fame.</P>
<P>Many People had such terrible Apprehensions upon this Occasion, and indeed there was Cause sufficient, that several Negroes (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many had been assisting at the Fire at the Storehouse, and many perhaps that only seemed to be so) who were met in the Streets, after the Alarm of their rising, were hurried away to Goal; and when they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they were continued some Time in Confinement before the Magistrates could spare Time to examine into their several Cases, how and for what they came there, many others first coming under Consideration before them against whom there seemed to be more direct Cause of Suspicion; but in a few Days, those against whom nothing in particular was alledged, were discharged.</P>
<P>It was said, there was like to have been another Fire this Day, though it has by some been supposed to have been an Accident: The Cellar of a Baker near <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntjes</HI> Market was all of a Smother, and the Chips in a Blaze: but was soon suppressed. This also occasion'd some Alarm.</P>
<P><HI>Quack (Walter'</HI>s) was sent for and committed; he remained in Confinement some Days without Examina∣tion, from the Hurry the Magistrates were in; but at length Mrs. <HI>Earle</HI> and Mrs. <HI>George</HI> being sent for by the Justices, they declared concerning him to the Effect before-mentioned:<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sunday, 5th April.</HI></NOTE> And <HI>Quack</HI> being brought before them, and examined, by his Excuse admitted he had spoken the Words he was charged with; but it being soon after we had the News of Admiral <HI>Vernon'</HI>s taking <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> he had contrived a cunning Excuse, or some abler Heads for him, to account for the Occasion of them, and brought two of his own Complexion to give their Words for it also, <HI>That they were talking of Admiral</HI> VERNON'<HI>s taking</HI> Porto Bello; <HI>and that he thereupon signified to his Companions, that he thought that was but a small F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at to what this brave Officer would do</HI> by-and-by, <HI>to annoy the Spaniards;</HI> or Words tantamount; <HI>so that it happen'd Quack</HI> was enlarged from his Confinement for some Time.</P>
<P>Others considering that it was but Eighteen Days after the Fort was laid in Ashes, that these Words were uttered; and that several other Fires had intervened, as before related; and but the next Day after <HI>Quick'</HI>s Stable and <HI>Ben Thomas'</HI>s House were on fire; and the Attempt upon Mr. <HI>Murray'</HI>s Haystack discovered that very Morning; they were apt to put a different Construction upon <HI>Quack'</HI>s Words and Beha∣viour; that he thereby meant, <Q>That the Fires which we had seen already, were nothing to what we should have <HI>by-and by,</HI> for that then we should have all the City in Flames, and he would rejoice at it;</Q> for it was said, he lifted up his Hands, and spread them with a circular Sweep over his Head, after he had pronounced the Words <HI>[by and by] and then concluded with a loud Laugh.</HI> Whether these Figures are thus more properly applied, the Reader will hereafter be better able to judge; but the Construction of them at that Time confirmed many in the Notion of a Conspiracy; though they could not suspect One of so black a Dye, as there were afterwards flagrant Proofs of, and will appear by and by.</P>
<P>His Honour the Lieutenant Governor was pleased to order a Military Watch to be kept this Evening, and the same was continued all the Summer after.</P>

<P>THE RECORDER taking Notice of the several Fires which had lately happened in this City, and the Man∣ner of them, which had put the Inhabitants into the utmost Consternation; that every one that reflected on the Cir∣cumstances attending them, the Frequency of them, and the Causes yet undiscovered; must necessarily conclude, that they were occasioned and set on Foot by some villainous Confederacy of latent Enemies amongst us; but with what Intent or Purpose, Time must discover; that it could not be doubted, but the Lieutenant Governor and His Majesty's Council had taken the Alarm at this Time of Danger, and were watchful, and anxious for the Safety of the City; and tho they were of Opinion, that it was highly proper and necessary that a Proclamation should be issued by the Go∣vernment, promising proper Rewards to such Person and Persons as should make such Discovery of the Incendiaties, their Confederates and Accomplices, as that they should be convicted thereof; <HI>Yet it was well known that the Governor and Council had not the Liberty of drawing upon the Colony Treasurer for any Sum of Money whatsoever, upon any Emer∣gency:</HI> And it could not be reasonably expected the Governor should subject himself to pay such Rewards out of his own Pocket, for the Use and Necessities of the Publick; that as the Safety of the City, so immediately concerned, seemed absolutely to require such a Measure to be taken; so the Publick, who were also interested in the Preservation of it, would reap the Benefit in common with them, by the Cor∣porations laudible Resolution, should they determine to en∣gage to pay proper Rewards, and request the Governor to issue a Proclamation agreeable thereto; which, he was per∣suaded, the Governor was well inclined to do, and the Gen∣tlemen of the Council to advise thereto; <HI>He therefore moved,</HI> <Q>That the Board should come to a Resolution to pay such Rewards as should by them be thought a proper and suf∣ficient Temptation to induce any Party or Parties con∣cerned to make such Discovery.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Upon Consideration whereof, it was</HI> <Q><HI>Ordered,</HI> That this Board request his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor to issue a Proclamation, offering a Reward to any white Person that should discover any Person or Persons lately concerned in setting Fire to any Dwelling House or Storehouse in this City (so that such Person or Persons be convicted thereof,) The <HI>Sum of One Hundred Pounds,</HI> Current Money of this Province; and that such Person shall be pardoned, if concerned therein: And any Slave that should make Discovery, to be ma∣numitted, or made free; and the Master of such Slave to receive <HI>Twenty-Five Pounds</HI> therefore; and the Slave to receive, besides his Freedom, the Sum of <HI>Twenty Pounds,</HI> and to be pardoned; and if a Free Negro, Mulatto, or Indian, to receive <HI>Forty-Five Pounds,</HI> and also to be pardoned, if concerned therein: And that this Board will issue their Warrant to the Chamberlain, or Treasurer of this Corporation for the Payment of such Sum as any Person by Vertue of such Proclamation shall be intitled unto. And that the Mayor and Recorder wait on his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, and acquaint him with the Resolution of this Board.</Q></P>
<P>The Mayor and Recorder waited on His Honour accordingly, and a Copy of the Order was also delivered to him.</P>
<P>Many Persons in the Neighbourhood of the several Fires beforementioned, thought it necessary to remove their Houshold Goods for Safety; and in their Consternation, as was natural, suffered any Body who offered their Assistance, to take them away; by which Means, some Villians had the Cruelty to make Prey of them; for there were great Complaints of Losses upon those Occasions, which the Ma∣gistrates took this Day into their Consideration. And it being much suspected that there were some Strangers lurking about the City, who had been the wicked Instruments and Occa∣sion of these Fires; but upon the Supposition only, that by those Means, they might have Opportunities of Pilfering and Plundering. A Scheme was proposed, that there should be a general Search of all Houses throughout the Town, whereby it was thought probable Discoveries might be made, not only of stolen Goods, but likewise of Lodgers,
<PB N="10" REF="005413_0017_1017394E60AF10C0"/>
that were Strangers, and suspicious Persons: The Proposal was approved of, and each Alderman and his Common Council-Man, with Constables attending them, undertook to search his respective Ward on the South Side of the Fresh Water Pond; and the Monday following was the Day fixed upon for making the Experiment.</P>
<P>The Scheme was communicated to the Governor, and his Honour thought fit to Order the Militia out that Day in Aid of the Magistrates, who were to be dispersed through the City, and Centries of them pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed at the Ends of the Streets to guard all Avenues, with Orders of stop all sus∣pected Persons that should be observed carrying Baggs or Bundles, or removing Goods from House to House, in order for their Examination; and all this was to be kept very Secret till the Project was putting in Execution.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>MONDAY, 13th APRIL.</HEAD>
<P>PURSUANT to the Scheme concerted on Saturday last, the <HI>general Search</HI> was made; but there were not any Goods discovered which were said to have been lost, nor was there any strange Lodger of suspicious Persons detected: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Things were found in the Custody of <HI>Robin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chambers'</HI>s Negro, and <HI>Cuba</HI> his Wife, which the Alder∣man thought improper for, and unbecoming the Condition of Slave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ which made him suspect they were not come ho∣nestly by; and therefore ordered the Constable to take them in Possession, to be reserved for further Enquiry: And these two Negroes were committed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>FRIDAY, 17th APRIL.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lieutenant-Governor, by and with the Advice of his Majesty's Council, issued a Proclamation, therein reciting the beforementioned Order and Resolution of the Common Council, promising the Rewards agreeable thereto.</P>
<P>In the mean whiile, between the Sixth and the Seven∣teenth Instant, a great deal of Time had been spent by the Magistrates in the Examination of the Negroes in Custody, upon Account of these Fires, but nothing could be got out of them.</P>
<P><HI>Cuff</HI> (PHILIPSE's) was closely interrogated, but he ab∣solutely denied knowing any thing of the Matter; he said he had been at home all that Afternoon, from the Time he returned from <HI>Hilton'</HI>s Fire, where he had been to assist and carry Buckets: That he was at home when the Bell rung for the Fire at Col. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Storehouse. It appeared, upon Enquiry and Examination of Witnesses, that he, ac∣cording to his Master▪s Orders, had been sawing Wood that Afternon with a white Boy; and that when his Master came home from Dinner, he took him off from that Work, and set him to sew on a Vane upon a Board for his Sloop; the white Boy testified, <Q>That he stood by him to see him sew it, and that he left him but a little before the Bell rung for the Fire:</Q> And when the Alarm of the Fire was, and that 'twas suppos'd to be at his Master's Storehouse, it was said, <HI>Cuff</HI> was asked whether he would go out with the Buckets, and that he should answer, <HI>he had enough of being out in the Morning.</HI> Some of the Neighbours also de∣clared that they had seen him looking over his Master's Door but a little before the Bell rung: But an old Man who had known <HI>Cuffee</HI> for several Years, deposed, that he had seen him at the Fire at the Storehouse, and that he stood next him: There seemed to be some Objection against the Man's Evidence; 'twas thought he might be Mistaken, being very near-sighted; Upon Examination, 'twas found he could distinguish Colours, and he described the Clothes he had on, and moreover declared, he spoke to him, and asked him, why he did not hand the Buckets; and that thereupon he answered him, and did hand Water, and that he knew his Voice.</P>
<P>There was very strong Proof that he was the Negro that leaped out of the Window of one of the Storehouses as the Fire was extinguished, and most of the People drawn away upon the new Alarm of a Fire; that he was seen to leap over several Garden Fences, and to run home in great Haste.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, 'twas thought proper <HI>Cuff</HI> should re∣main in Confinement, to await further Discovery.</P>

<P>Mr. Justice PHILLIPSE gave the Charge to the <HI>Grand Jury</HI> as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,</HI></P>
<P>IT is not without some Concern, that I am obliged at this Time to be more particular in your Charge than for many preceeding Terms there hath been Occasion. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many Frights and Terrors which the good People of this City have of late been put into, by repeated and unusual Fires, and burning of Houses, give us too much Room to suspect, that some of them at least did not pro∣ceed from meer Chance or common Accidents; but on the Contrary, from the premeditated Malice and wicked Purposes of evil and designing Persons; and therefore it greatly behoves us to use our utmost Diligence by all lawful Ways and Means to discover the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Perpetrators of such daring and flagitious Under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings: That, upon Conviction, they may receive condign Pu∣nishment: For although we have the Happiness of living under a Government which exceeds all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the Excellency of it's Constitution and I am▪ you if those to whom the Execution of them (which <HI>My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> COKE calls the Life and Soul of the Law) is committed, do not exert themselves in a conscientious Discharge of their respective Duties; such Laws which were intended for a Terror to the Evil Doer, and a Protection to the Good, will become a dead Letter, and our most excellent Constitution turned into Anarchy and Confusion; every one practising what he li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teth; and doing what shall seem good in his own Eyes: To prevent which, it is the Duty of all Grand Juries to enquire into the Conduct and Behaviour of the People in their respective Counties; and if, upon Examination, they find any to have trans∣gressed the Laws of the Land, to present them, that so they may by the Court be put upon their Tryal, and then either to be discharged or punished according to their Demerits.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005413_0019_10173956B6937750"/>
I am told there are several Prisoners now in Goal, who have been committed by the City Magistrates, upon Suspicion of having been concerned in some of the late Fires; and others, who under Pretence of assisting the unhappy Sufferers, by saving their Goods from the Flames, for stealing, or receiving the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>: This indeed is adding Affliction to the Afflicted, and is a very great Aggravation of such Crime, and therefore deserves a nar∣row Inquiry; that so the exemplary Punishment of the Guilty (if any such should be so found) may deter others from committing the like Villanie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ for this kind of Stealing, I think, has not been often practised among us.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>ARSON, or the malicious and voluntary Burning, not only a Mansion House, but also any other House, and the Out-Buildings, or Barns, and Stables adjoining thereto, by Night or by Day, is Felony at Common Law; and if any Part of the House be burnt, the Offender is guilty of Felony, notwithstanding the Fire afterwards be put outs or go out of itself.</P>
<P>This Crime is of so shocking a Nature. that if we have any in this City, who, having been guilty thereof, should escape, who can say he is safe, or tell where it will end?</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Another Thing which I cannot omit recommending to your serious and diligent Enquiry, is to find out and pre∣sent all such Persons who sell Rum, and other strong Li∣quor to Negroes: It must be obvious to every one, that there are too many of them in this City; who under Pretence of selling what they call a Penny Dram to a Negro, will sell to him as many Quarts or Gallons of Rum, as he can steal Money or Goods to pay for.</P>
<P>How this Notion of its being lawful to sell a Penny Dram, or a Pennyworth of Rum to a Slave, without the Consent or Direction of his Master, has prevailed, I know not; but this I am sure of, that there is not only no such Law; but that the doing of it is directly contrary to an Act of Assembly now in Force, <HI>for the better Regulating of Slaves.</HI> The many fatal Consequences flowing from this prevailing and wicked Practice are so notorious, and so nearly con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n us all, that one would almost be surpri∣zed, to think there should be a Necessity for a Court to recommend the Surpressing of such Pernicious Houses: Thus much in Particular; now in General,</P>
<P><HI>My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arge, Gentlemen,</HI> further is, to prevent all Conspiracies, Combinations, and other Offences, from Treasons down to Trespasses; and in your Enquiries, the Oath you, and each of you have just now taken, will, I am persuaded, be your Guide and I pray God to direct and assist you in the Discharge of your Duty.</P></Q>

The Constable was some time gone, but at length returned, and brought her with him; and being asked <HI>why she would not be sworn, and give her Evidence?</HI> She told the Grand Jury <HI>she would not be sworn;</HI> and seemed to be under some great Uneasiness, or terrible Apprehensions; which gave Suspicion that she knew something concerning the Fires that had lately happened: And being ask'd a Question to that Purpose, <HI>she gave no Answer;</HI> which increased the Jea∣lousy that she was Privy to them: And as it was thought a Matter of the utmost Concern, the Grand Jury was very importunate, and used many Arguments with her, in pub∣lick, and private, to persuade her to speak the Truth, and tell all she knew about it. To this End, the Lieutenant Governor's Proclamation was read to her, promising In∣demnity, and the Reward of <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> to any Person, Confederate or not, who should make Discovery, <HI>&amp;c. She seemed to despise it,</HI> nor could the Grand Jury by any Means, either Threats or Promises, prevail upon her, though they assured her withal, that she should have the Protection of the Magistrates, and her Person be safe and secure from harm; but hitherto all was in vain: Therefore the Grand Jury desired Alderman <HI>Banker</HI> to commit her; and the Constable was charged with her accordingly; but before he had got her to the Jail, she considered better of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and resolved to be sworn, and give her Evidence in the Afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005413_0020_10173958A777F160"/>
Accordingly, she <HI>being sworn,</HI> came before the Grand Jury; but as they were proceeding to her Examination, and <HI>before they asked her any Questions,</HI> she told them she would acquaint them with what she knew relating to the Goods stolen from Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s, <HI>but would say nothing about the Fires.</HI></P>
<P>This Expression thus, as it were Providentially, slipping from the Evidence, much alarmed the Grand Jury; for, as they naturally concluded, it did by Construction amount to an Affirmative, that she could give an Account of the Occasion of the several Fires; and-therefore, as it highly became those Gentlemen in the Discharge of their Trust, they determined to use their utmost Diligence to sift out the Discovery.</P>
<P>But still she remained inflexible; till at length, having recourse to Religious Topicks, representing to her the Hei∣niousness of the Crime which she would be guilty of, if she was privy to, and could discover, so wicked a Design, as the Firing Houses about our Ears; whereby not only Peo∣ple's Estates would be destroyed, but many Persons might loose their Lives in the Flames: This she would have to answer for at the Day of Judgment, as much as any Person immediately concerned; because she might have prevented this Distruction, and would not; so that a most damnable Sin would lie at her Door; and what need she fear from her divulging it; she was sure of the Protection of the Magi∣strates? Or the Grand Jury expressed themselves in Words to the same Purpose; which Arguments at last prevailed, and she gave the following Evidence: Which, however, notwithstanding what had been said, came from her, as if still under some terrible Apprehensions or Restraints.</P>

<P>This EVIDENCE of a Conspiracy, not only to burn the City, but also destroy and murder the People, was most asto∣nishing to the Grand Jury, and <HI>that any white People should become so abandoned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to confederate with Slaves in such an execrable and detestable Purpose,</HI> could not but be very amaz∣ing to every one that heard it; what could scarce be cre∣dited; But that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e several Fires had been occasioned by

some Combination of Villians, was, at the Time of them, naturally to be collected from the Manner and Circum∣stances attending them.</P>
<P>The Grand Jury therefore, as it was a Matter of the utmost Consequence, thought it necessary to inform the Judges concerning it, in or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that the most effectual Mea∣sures might be concerted, for discovering the Confederates; and the Judges were acquainted with it accordingly.</P>

<P>The Court adjourned till To-morrow Morning Ten o'Clock.</P>
<P>This Morning the Judges summoned all the Gentlemen of the Law in Town, to meet them in the Afternoon, in order to consult with them, and determine upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch Mea∣sures as on the Result of their Deliberations should be judged most proper to be taken upon the Emergency; and Mr. <HI>Murray,</HI> Mr. <HI>Alexander,</HI> Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chambers,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nicholls,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lodge,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>son,</HI> met them accordingly; the <HI>Attorney General</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, indisposed, could not attend.</P>
<P>It was considered.

<P>The Gentlemen of the Law generously and unanimously offered to give their Assistance on every Tryal in their Turns, as this was conceived to be a Matter that not only affected the City, but the whole Province.</P>
<P><HI>Margaret Kerry,</HI> commonly called <HI>Peggy</HI> committed for <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Robbery, being impeached by <HI>Mary Burton,</HI> as one of the Conspirators, the Judges examined her in Prison in the Evening; they exhorted her to make an ingenuous Confession and Discovery of what she knew of it, and gave her Hopes of their Recommendation to the Governor for a Pardon, if they could be of Opinion that she deserved it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssuring her (as the Case wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) that they had His Honour's Permission to give Hopes of Mercy to such Criminals as should confess their Guilt, and they should think proper to recommend to him as fit and proper Objects: But she withstood it, and positively denied that she knew any Thing of the Matter; and said, <HI>That if she should accuse any Body of any such Thing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he must accuse innocent Persons, and</HI> W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ONG HER OWN SOUL.

Upon these and other presumptive Circumstances and Proofs, both Negroes were apprehended, and in a few Days tried, convicted, and burnt at a Stake: The former con∣fessed, he had set Fire to three of the Barns; <HI>the latter would confess nothing; nor would either of them discover,</HI> that any others were concerned with them in this Villany.</P>

<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. That Yesterday Morning having Discourse with <HI>Sarah</HI> the Daughter of <HI>John Hughson,</HI> about the Fires which have lately happened in the Town; she told him, That she had been with a Fortune Teller, who told her that in less than five Weeks Time she would come to Trouble, if she did not take good Care of herself; but after that she would come to good Fortune; then he enquired of her Father's Fortune; and she said, her Fa∣ther would be tried and condemned, but not hanged; but wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to go over the Water.</P>
<P N="2">2. That then, after some other Discourse, the Depo∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nent told her, that some of the Negroes who were concerned in the Plot about the Fires, had discovered; upon which she said, she did not know of any Plot; and thereupon he told her, that they that were <HI>sworn</HI> in the Plot had discovered, and brought them every one in: Upon which she coloured, and put her Bonnet back, and changed Colour several times, and asked him if he knew who it was and when he had heard it? And he told her, he had heard it by the by, and it was kept private: Upon which she made a long stop; and then said, it must be either HOLT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s <HI>Negro</HI> or TODD's; for, said she▪ <HI>we were always afraid of them, and mistrusted them, tho' they were as bad as the Rest, and were to have set their own Master's Houses on Fire;</HI> and then she said, <HI>I wish that</HI> Todd <HI>had sent his black Dog away, or sold him, when he was a going to do it.</HI><NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Dundee: TODD <HI>it seems, did threaten, and was going to send this Negro beyond Sea <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fall; so that her Intelligence was right.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. That then the Deponent told her, Sure you had better tell every Thing that you know; for that may be of some Service to your Father: Upon which she said, No; for that they were doing all that ever they could to take his Life away; and that she would sooner suffer Death, and be hanged with her Daddy (if he was to be hanged) <HI>than she would give them that Satisfaction of telling or discovering any thing to them;</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Words to that Effect▪ That she was to have gone up into the Country (like a Fool that she was that she did not go) but staid to see what would become of her Mammy and Daddy; but that now she would go up in the Coun∣try, and that she would be hanged if ever they should get her in <HI>York</HI> again; but if <HI>they</HI> (meaning the People of this City, as he understood) <HI>had not better Care of them∣selves, they would have a great deal more Damage and Danger in</HI> York, <HI>than they were aware of;</HI> and if they did hang her Daddy, they had better do something else: And as to the Fire at the Fort, they did not set the Sad∣dle on the right Horse.</P>

<HEAD>Supreme Court. FRIDAY, 8th MAY.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, The Second and Third Justices.</P>
<P>The KING, <HI>against</HI> Caesar <HI>and</HI> Prince, <HI>Negroes.</HI></P>
<P>THE Prisoners having been capitally convicted on two several Indictments for Felony, and being brought to the Bar, the Court proceeded to give Sentence; which was pass'd by the Second Justice, as followeth.</P>
<Q><P>YOU <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Prince,</HI> the Grand Jury having found two Indictments against each of you, for felo∣niously stealing and taking away from Mr. <HI>Hogg,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Meyers Coh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> sundry Goods of considerable Value; to these Indictments you severally pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty;</HI> and for your Trials, put yourselves upon God and the Country: Which Country having found you Guilty; it now only remains for the Court to pronounce that Judg∣ment which the Law requires, and the Nature of your Crimes deserve.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to Sentence, I must tell you, that you have been proceeded against in the same Man∣ner as any white Man, guilty of your Crimes would have been: You had not only the Liberty of sending for your Witnesses; asking them such Questions as you thought proper; but likewise making the best Defence you could; and as you have been convicted by twelve honest Men upon their Oaths; so the just Judgment of GOD has at length overtaken you.</P>
<P>I have great Reason to believe, that the Crimes you now stand convicted of, are not the least of those you have been concerned in; for by your general Characters you have been very wicked Fellows, hardened Sinners, and ripe, as well as ready, for the most enormous and
<PB N="21" REF="005413_0028_10173974F693D8F8"/>
daring Enterprizes; especially you, <HI>Caesar:</HI> And as the Time you have yet to live is to be but very short, I earnestly advise and exhort both of you to employ it in the most diligent and best Manner you can, by confessing your Sins, repenting sincerely of them, and praying GOD of his infinite Goodness to have Mercy on your Souls: And as GOD knows the Secrets of your Hearts, and cannot be cheated or imposed upon; so you must shortly give an Account to him, and answer for all your Actions; and depend upon it, if you do not truly repent before you die, there is a Hell to punish the Wicked eternally.</P>
<P>And as it is not in your Powers to make full Restitu∣tion for the many Injuries you have done the Publick; so I advise both of you to do all that in you is, to prevent <HI>further Mischiefs;</HI> by discovering such Persons as have been concerned with you in designing or endeavouring to burn this City, and to destroy its Inhabitants: This I am fully persuaded is in your Power to do if you will; if so, and you do not make such Discovery; be assured God Almighty will punish you for it, though we do not: Therefore I advise you to consider this well, and I hope both of you will tell the Truth.</P>
<P>And now, Nothing further remains for me to say; but</P>
<P>THAT you <HI>Caesar,</HI> and you <HI>Prince,</HI> are to be taken hence to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and there you, and each of you, are to be hanged by the Neck until you be dead.</P>
<P>And I pray the Lord to have Mercy on your Souls.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That their Execution be on <HI>Monday</HI> next, the Eleventh Day of this Instant, between the Hours of Nine and One of the same Day.</P>
<P>And further <HI>Ordered,</HI> That after the Execution of the said Sentence, the Body of <HI>Caesar</HI> be hung in Chains.</P>
<P>Court adjourned till <HI>Monday</HI> Morning next Ten o'Clock.</P>
<P><HI>PEGGY</HI> was examined by the Judges touching the Matter of her Confession delivered in Writing last Night, which she declared for Truth; and for the greater Solemnity was sworn to it, after having been seriously ad∣monished not to dare to say any Thing but the Truth, or to accuse innocent Persons: She was told, that we had dived so far into this Mystery of Iniquity already, that we could easily discern whether she prevaricated or not; and that if she did, she must not flatter herself with he Hopes of being recommended to Mercy; so that such disingenuous Behaviour would but deceive herself, and make her Case desperate; or in Words to that Purpose: She put on the Air of Sincerity, as if disposed to make a Discovery; but seemed to be under terrible Apprehensions. What she said, corresponded with the Scheme of the Plot so far as we had got Light into it, and in a great Measure confirmed what <HI>Arthur Price</HI> said in his Deposition, NUMB. I before, with this Difference, that she shifted the Scene from <HI>John Hughson'</HI>s to <HI>John Romme'</HI>s, and protested that she did not know that the <HI>Hughsons</HI> were any wise privy to, or con∣cerned in the Conspiracy.</P>
<P>At this Examination, she related a great many Particulars, which for want of Time were not committed to Writing; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> further Examination deferred to the next Day.</P>
<P><HI>Romme</HI> at this Time absconded; Orders having been given for apprehending him long before, upon Suspicion of his having received some of the Goods stolen from Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s; and <HI>Peggy</HI> and her Advisers might think as he was out of reach, she might safely shift the Scene to his House: Or this bloody Scheme might have been brooding at both Places, and with her Knowledge; but one may be per∣suaded from the Course of the Evidence, that <HI>Romme</HI> was apprized at least of the Conspiracy carrying on at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s.</P>
<P>Upon this Examination, <HI>Romme'</HI>s Wife was apprehended and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

she employed the said <HI>Romme</HI> in making Shoes for her; and on that Account became acquainted with him and his Wife, and used often to go backwards and forwards to and from the said House; by which Means she had the Opportunity of seeing many Negroes there at several different Times, who used to resort thither to drink Drams, Punch and other strong Liquors; the said <HI>Romme</HI> keeping a Publick House▪ and that often Numbers of them have continued at the said <HI>Romme'</HI>s House till two or three o'Clock in the Morning, to her Knowledge, drinking, singing and playing at Dice.</P>

<P N="8">8.

<P>This Afternoon Orders were given for apprehending the several Negroes mentioned by <HI>Peggy</HI> to have been present at <HI>Romme'</HI>s at the Time she said <HI>Romme</HI> and the Negroes were talking of the Conspiracy; those of them whom she knew by Name, and were not before committed, were soon found, and brought to Jail.</P>
<P>In the Evening the Judges came to the City Hall, and sent for <HI>Peggy,</HI> and had the several Negroes brought one by one, and passed in Review before her, <HI>viz.

<P>These Negroes were each of them seperately examined, and denied being at any such Meeting, or that they knew any thing of the Conspiracy.</P>
<P>At first, <HI>Cork</HI> (ENGLISH's Negro) was brought by Mi∣stake instead of <HI>Patrick;</HI> and <HI>Peggy</HI> declared, he was not <HI>English'</HI>s Negro which she meant: <HI>Cork</HI> was unfortu∣nately of a Countenance somewhat ill favoured, naturally of a suspicious Look, and reckoned withal to be unlucky too; his being sent for before the Magistrates in such a perilous Season, might be thought sufficient to alarm the most Innocent of them, and occasion the Appearance of their being under some terrible Apprehensions; but it was much otherwise with <HI>Cork;</HI> and notwithstanding the Disad∣vantage of his natural Aspect, upon his being interrogated concerning the Conspiracy; he shewed such a chearful, open, honest Smile upon his Countenance (<HI>none of your fictitious hypocritical Grins</HI>) that every one that was by, and observed it (and there were several in the Room) jump'd in the same Observation and Opinion, That they never saw the Fellow look so handsom: Such an Efficacy have Truth and Innocence, that they even reflect Beauty upon Deformity!</P>

<P>A Young Negro Fellow of Mrs. <HI>Carpenter'</HI>s had given some Information, That <HI>Sarah</HI> (NIBLET's Negro Wench) had told him, that <HI>Sawney,</HI> alias <HI>Sandy</HI> (NIBLET's Negro Boy, of about Sixteen or Seventeen Years of Age) had been concerned in setting the Fort on fire; that he had likewise set <HI>Muchado'</HI>s House, next Door to his Master's, on fire; and had also thrown Fire over Alderman <HI>Bancker'</HI>s Fence into his Yard.

<P>These two Negroes bore the Characters of very wicked idle Fellows; had before been detected in some Robberies, for which they had been publickly chastised at the Whip∣ping-Post, and were Persons of most obstinate and untracta∣ble Tempers; so that there was no Expectation of drawing any Thing from them which would make for the Discovery of the Conspiracy; though there seemed good Reason to conclude, as well from their Characters as what had been charged upon them by Information from others, that they were Two principal Ringleaders in it amongst the <HI>Blacks:</HI> It was thought proper to execute them for the Robbery, and not wait the Bringing them to a Trial for the Con∣spiracy, though the Proof against them was strong and clear concerning their Guilt as to that also; and it was imagined, that as Stealing and Plundering was a principal Part of the Hellish Scheme in Agitation, amongst the inferior Sort of these infernal Confederates; this Earnest of Example and Punishment mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ak the Knot, and induce some of them to unfold this Mystery of Iniquity, in Hopes thereby to recommend themselves to Mercy; and it is probable, that with some it had this Effect.</P>

<P><HI>MARGARET SALINGBURGH,</HI> alias <HI>KERRY,</HI> saith.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. That about a Fortnight after she came to lodge at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House (she believes it was about the Beginning of <HI>February) John Romme</HI> came there, when <HI>Hughson</HI> was gone into the Woods to cut Fire-Wood; but <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Wife being at home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Romme</HI> entered into Conversation with her, when the Examinant was present; and she heard him say to her (after calling for a Mug of Punch, and after observing how hard the Winter was) that he did not know how it was with them; and though he had Money enough himself; yet he could not buy Wood for it; but that he had a Parcel of <HI>Good Children</HI> (meaning the Ne∣groes, as she understood) who brought him Wood almost every Night; or Words to that Purpose; so that he had done well enough hitherto. And the Examinant saith, that the Reason why she understood the said <HI>Romme</HI> to mean the Negroes by the Words, <HI>Good Children,</HI> was, because she herself several Times saw <HI>Cuff</HI> (Mr. PHILIPSE's) and <HI>Caesar</HI> (VAARCK's) and sometimes <HI>Cuff'</HI>s <HI>Brother,</HI> and the White Boy called <HI>Yorkshire</HI><NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Christopher Wilson.</NOTE> bring Wood there a-Nights: That <HI>Hughson's Wife</HI> answered, that it was poor enough with them; that he (<HI>Romme</HI>) was a Gentleman, and could live without Work: To which <HI>Romme</HI> said, that if <HI>Hughson</HI> would join with him, and take a Quantity of Fifty or Sixty Firkins of Butter in; meaning, as the Deponent understood, into <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House, to conceal them; for <HI>Romme</HI> said, it was too hard for him to conceal such a Quantity; but that <HI>Hughson</HI> in his large House, might much easier make away with them, and conceal them: To which <HI>Hughson'</HI>s <HI>Wife</HI> said, <HI>She did not know; but she believed her Hus∣band would not have any Hand in it:</HI> Oh! says <HI>Romme,</HI> I want to talk to him myself; for that he knew how Cir∣cumstances were with them: By and by towards the Evening he would come again, and talk to him; for that he wanted a Load of Wood.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="29" REF="005413_0036_1017398D4D6BBEC8"/>
2. That she was afterwards informed by <HI>Hughson</HI> him∣self, that <HI>Romme</HI> was returning to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House in the Evening, and met <HI>Hughson</HI> with a Sleigh-Load of Wood in the Street, which <HI>Hughson</HI> carried down to <HI>Romme'</HI>s House.</P>
<P N="3">3. That at the Time of <HI>Romme'</HI>s discoursing with <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Wife about receiving Butter as aforesaid, he further said, that as to Butter, the Weather was so hard, and the Ground so frozen, that he did not know how to hide them away; and as no Vessels could go out, he could not ship them off; and he believed Gammons would do better; that his Brother was going to <HI>Carolina;</HI> and that he could stow them in his Cabbin, when there could not be Room to stow there Fifty or Sixty Firkins of Butter. And by the Discourse, the Deponent un∣derstood, that <HI>Romme</HI> proposed to get the Butter and Gammons both from the Weigh-house, or some of the Storehouses thereabouts.</P>
<P N="4">4. That she has at several Times seen Goods of se∣veral Kinds brought to <HI>Romme'</HI>s House, that she suspected to have been stolen: And that after the Oath of Secresy taken by the Deponent, and mentioned in a former Exa∣mination, the said <HI>Romme</HI> would talk freely to her about such stolen Goods as she happened to see brought to his House▪ and <HI>Romme'</HI>s Wife used to help receive such stolen Goods, and used to conceal them away.</P></Q>

<P>From what had hitherto come to Light concerning this Mystery of Iniquity, it was scarce to be doubted, but <HI>Peggy</HI> had it in her Power to unfold a great deal more of it▪ as she lodged at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s; which from the Course of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other Evidence, was the principal Place the Conspirators resorted to for holding their Consultations: And though what <HI>Peggy</HI> had already disclosed seemed to merit something; yet it was not altogether satisfactory; and 'twas thought pro∣per she should be arraigned upon the Indictment for the Conspiracy, upon the Supposition that this Step might pro∣bably be a Means of bringing her to a Resolution of making a full Discovery of what she knew.</P>

<P>A Few Days ago <HI>John Romme</HI> was stopt and secured by a Magistrate at <HI>Brunswick,</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey▪</HI> which he very prudently did, and notified to a Magistrate of this City: Whereupon <HI>Romme</HI> was sent for, and this Day committed to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail.</P>
<P><HI>Romme,</HI> upon Examination, also confessed, as his Wife had done before, that some Firkins of butter had been brought by Negroes to his House; and he was even with his Wife, saying, <HI>they were received by her, that he had no Hand in it:</HI> And he also positively denied, that he knew any Thing of the Plot▪ and that any such Discourse had passed at his House, as before declared by <HI>Peggy</HI> in her Examinations.

<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1.

3. That <HI>Romme</HI> said, he lay abed, and that his Wife was up and saw the Butter put in the Yard; and that after the Negroes were gone, he himself got up and stowed it away under the Wood in an old House in the Yard.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P>For the greater Solemnity of the Matter, <HI>Peggy</HI> also swore to and signed her three several Examinations.</P>
<P>This History of <HI>Peggy'</HI>s contained in her three Exami∣nations corresponds so exactly as to the Persons of, and Charge against, such Negroes (mentioned by others) which she brings in Question; and also with the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter and Circumstances of the Conspiracy, which the Reader may hereafter perceive from the whole Current of Depositions and Examinations of Whites and Blacks; that one may be very apt to conclude, she only shifted the Scene and laid it in a wrong Place.</P>
<P><HI>Peggy</HI> very well knew that <HI>Romme</HI> had fled the Country upon the Enquiry about the Robbery at <HI>Hogg'</HI>s; and pro∣bably that, finding her own Life in Jeopardy concern∣ing that Felony, as well as the Conspiracy, which she now was sensible had got Air, and was like to be detected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and partly by her own frank Talk and Openness with her Fellow Prisoner <HI>Price;</HI> she therefore might think it high Time to provide for her own Safety, if she could do it so cheap as by amusing us with a Narrative of the Plot; which, though real and true in other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nevertheless she charged the Confederacy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about it to have been held solely at <HI>Romme'</HI>s, us to the Knowledge she had concerning it; and so screen'd the other Confederates. <HI>Hughson, his Wife and Family,</HI> at whose House principally these Miscreants associated; though what she declared might be true as to both Places, and there seems to be too much Reason to mistrust it was so; yet the absolutely denied to the last, that she had ever heard any such Discourse at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, though frequently interrogated very strictly to that Purpose, and admonished in the most solemn Manner to declare the whole Truth, if she intended to do herself any Service, or induce the Judges to recommend her as an Object deserving of Mercy.</P>
<P>However, though there was little Reason to think that <HI>Peggy</HI> had told all that she knew of the Matter: yet that what she had said was, in the main, true, there seemed no Doubt, as said before, from the Correspondence between her Story and that of the other Evidences, so far as they had discovered with relation to the Conspiracy▪ the only Question was, Whether it was carried on at <HI>Romme's, </HI> as well as <HI>Hughson'</HI>s? From her lodging and Intimacy with the <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, she might be inclined to favour them, and lay the Scene at <HI>Romme'</HI>s only, who was then thought to be out of reach; and so make Merit of a fallacious Sort of Discovery. But we had great Hopes, that if she should be convicted upon the Indictment for the Conspiracy, she would come to a Resolution to make an ingenuous Con∣fession in order to save herself: And with this Expectation, and considering what she had confessed already, the Judges were induced to recommend her to the Lieutenant Governor for a Pardon, on this Condition nevertheless, that it should not pass the Seal till she should be thought amply to have merited it.</P>
<P>And a Pardon was accordingly prepared for her, ready to pass the Seal when it should be sent for by the Judges.</P>

<HEAD>The Examination of Fortune, Negro of JOHN WILKINS: Before the Grand Jury.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">NUMB. I.</HEAD>
<P>He <HI>said,</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. THAT <HI>Quack,</HI> the Negro of <HI>John Roosevelt,</HI> about a Week or Ten Days before the Fort was burnt, desired him the Examinant, to take a Walk with him (being Sunday Afternoon) and that he went with him into the Common; where <HI>Quack</HI> left him a little while, and went down into the Swamp, near the Powder House, where he gathered something, and soon returned to him again.</P>
<P N="2">2. That when <HI>Quack</HI> came back, the Examinant asked him what he had got? To which <HI>Quack</HI> replied, he would not tell him; but asked him the Examinant to go with him to the Fort, and he would give him some Punch, and see his Wife: That accordingly they went to the Fort; though the Examinant says, that he did not go very willingly.</P>
<P N="3">3. That when they came to the Fort, <HI>Quack</HI> carried him into the Kitchen, where he kept him 'til it began to grow dark; and then the Examinant told <HI>Quack,</HI> that he must be going; for that the Watch would take him up: To which <HI>Quack</HI> answered, that there was no Danger of that.</P>
<P N="4">4. That <HI>Quack</HI> gave him no Punch, but asked him to drink a Dram; which the Examinant refused; and so both came from the Fort, keeping Company 'till they came by the House of Captain <HI>Pearse,</HI> where they par∣ted; the Examinant returning home through Beaver-Street, and <HI>Quack</HI> (as the Examinant believed) went back to the Fort.</P>
<P N="5">5. That what is above recited was all that passed be∣tween them at their first Meeting, on Sunday Afternoon; but that two or three Days after, <HI>Quack</HI> met him at the Pump near the great Slip, but nothing was said, or passed between them remarkable.</P>
<P N="6">6. That about three Days after that, he met with <HI>Quack</HI> again, near the House of Mrs. <HI>Carpenter,</HI> at which Place, he (<HI>Quack</HI>) asked him, why he was in such Hast, when he was last at the Fort? To which the Examinant answered as before, that he was afraid of the Watch: To which <HI>Quack</HI> replied again, that there was no Fear of that; and invited him to come to see him again at the Fort; but the Examinant refused, saying that he had promised him Punch before, and gave him none.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="34" REF="005413_0041_1017399C82CB8F98"/>
7. That about two Days before the Fort was burnt, he met with <HI>Quack</HI> again, near the House of Mrs <HI>Rickets,</HI> where he told the Examinant, <HI>That in, a few Days there would be great Alterations in the Fort:</HI> On which the Examinant asked him, What Alterations? To which <HI>Quack</HI> answered, <HI>That the Fort would be burnt:</HI> The Examinant on that, asked him, who would do it? <HI>Quack</HI> replied, You may ask <HI>Niblet'</HI>s Negro, and he will tell you. That he did ask <HI>Niblet'</HI>s Negro, Who was to burn the Fort? To which he answered, <HI>Quack, him∣self,</HI> and <HI>Cuffee</HI> (GOMEZ's) they would do it.</P>
<P N="8">8. That next Day after the Fire, the Examinant m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Sandy</HI> (NIBLET's) who said to him, <HI>We have done the Business;</HI> and the same Day he met <HI>Quack,</HI> who likewise said to him, <HI>The Business is done:</HI> That when <HI>Quack</HI> told him, <HI>that the Business was done,</HI> he asked him, <HI>What Business?</HI> To which <HI>Quack</HI> answered, <HI>The Fort is burnt; don't you remember that I told you, there would be great Alterations in the Fort?</HI> And that he told him at the same Time, that he <HI>(Quack)</HI> NIBLET's <HI>Sandy,</HI> and GOMEZ'<HI>s Cuffee</HI> had done it.</P></Q>
<P N="9">9. Being further interrogated, whether he knew of any other Negroes concerned in burning the Fort, besides those above named? he answered, <Q REND="margQuotes">That he knew not of any but <HI>Sandy Quack,</HI> and <HI>Cuffee.</HI></Q></P>

To which Indictments each of these Criminals, upon their Arraignment, pleaded <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>The Attorney General having opened the Indictments, spoke to the Court and Jury as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>May it please your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury:</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a Cause of very great Expectation; it being as I conceive, a Matter of the utmost Importance that ever yet came to be tried in this Province; where∣fore, before I call the Witnesses to prove these two Negroes guilty, I shall briefly mention to you something concerning this Mystery of Iniquity in general, how and where it was formed and carried on, and what Share these two Criminals had in it.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Not only these two Negroes, but divers others, and several white People, as will appear to you in the Course of our Evidence, have been concerned with these wretched Offenders, in this most wicked and devilish Conspiracy.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>You will hear from the Mouths of our Witnesses, that these two Negroes with divers others, frequently met at the House of one <HI>John Hughson,</HI> in this City:—It was there they were harboured:—<HI>There</HI> was the Place of their general Rendezvous; and <HI>there</HI> it was this hellish Con∣spiracy was brooded, formed, consented and agreed to:—It was <HI>there</HI> that these two Negroes, and the Rest of the Conspirators, came to a Resolution of <HI>burning the King's House at the Fort, and this whole Town; and of murdering the Inhabitnats</HI> as they should come to extin∣guish the Flames.—CRIMES, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> so astonish∣ingly cruel and detestable; that one would think they could never have entered into the Minds, much less the Resolution, of any <HI>but a Conclave of Devils</HI> to execute; and yet such Monsters in Iniquity are these two Criminals and the Rest of their Confederates.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>It will likewise appear to you, by <HI>Quack'</HI>s own Con∣fession (as we shall in the Course of our Evidence for the King upon thir Trial shew you) That, in Prosecution of such their most abominable Conspiracies, the King's House was by him (at the Instigation of the Rest of the Conspirators) set on Fire, burnt down, and consumed.</P>
<P>And then as to <HI>Cuffee,</HI> we shall shew <HI>You,</HI> that he is doubtless Guilty of the Charge against him.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>The Eyes of the Inhabitants of this City and Province are upon <HI>You,</HI> relying on, and confiding in <HI>You;</HI> that by the Justice of your Verdict in this Cause this Day, the Peace and Safety of this City and Province may for the Future be secured to them; which at present (until some Examples are made) seem very precarious.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>It is in <HI>You,</HI> the People in general, place their Hopes and Expectations of their future Security and Repose; that they may sit securely in their own Houses, and rest quietly in their Beds, no one daring to make them afraid.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to examine the Witnesses for the King, to support the Charge against each of these Cri∣minals▪ and can make no doubt, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> but when you have heard the Evidence against them, you will for your own Sakes, your Oaths Sake, and for the Peace, Quiet, and Security of your Country, find these two Negroes Guilty.</P></Q>

<P>That at a Meeting of the Negroes at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House, <HI>Hughson</HI> said they were all sworn, <HI>Negroes</HI> and <HI>white People</HI> present, as she understood; that is, <HI>Hughson, his Wife, Daughter Sarah,</HI> and <HI>Peggy;</HI> and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Purport of the Oath was, <HI>That they were not to discover the Secrets about firing the Fort, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Houses at the Fly, and the whole Town; and about murdering the White People:</HI> And <HI>Hughson</HI> said to, the Negroes present, which were <HI>Cuffee, Caesar</HI> and <HI>Prince, Now you must take Care; for you are all sworn;</HI> and at the same Time the Witness saw a Bible, as she took it to be, in <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Hand, and when the Witness came into the Room he laid it upon the Table; and then <HI>Caesar</HI> spoke to the Witness and cautioned her not to tell; and <HI>Hughson</HI> made Answer, that she dared not; and <HI>Cuffee</HI> said, <HI>D</HI>—<HI>n his Bl</HI>—<HI>d, if he would tell of any, if he was burnt;</HI> and so said the other two Ne∣groes; and so said <HI>Hughson, his Wife, Daughter, Sarah,</HI> and <HI>Peggy.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>ARTHUR PRICE</HI> said, <Q>That soon after <HI>Cuffee,</HI> the Prisoner at the Bar, came to Goal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he had some Discourse with him over a Bowl or Tankard of Punch, being confined in the same Room together, and that, amongst other Things, <HI>Cuffee</HI> said, That he was one of the <HI>Geneva Club</HI><NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Note upon</HI> Arthur Price'<HI>s Deposition</HI> NUMB. III. <HI>before, Letter (p) Tuesday 12th May.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that was sworn,</HI> but being overcome with Sleep, he did not go to their Meeting at that Time; That <HI>Cuffee</HI> asked the Witness, what could be the Reason that <HI>Peggy</HI> was called down so often; that the Witness answered, he thought <HI>Peggy</HI> was discovering the Plot about the Fire at the Fort. <HI>Cuffee</HI> replied, she could not do that unless she <HI>forswore herself, he knew;</HI> for that <HI>he that had done that was sworn after she was in Prison.</HI> That he left his Master's House in the Evening and went along the Wharffs to the Fly Market, and waited there 'til one <HI>Quack</HI> came out of his Master's House; they two went then to <HI>John Hughson'</HI>s, where they met no body but <HI>Hughson, his Wife,</HI> and <HI>Daughter Sarah;</HI> that they called for a Tankard of Punch; that <HI>Hughson</HI> swore <HI>Quack</HI> three Times; that they only drank out their Punch, and then went down to the Fly: That the Witness thereupon said to <HI>Cuffee,</HI> that he be∣lieved he knew that <HI>Quack,</HI> and that he lived with a Butcher; <HI>Cuffee</HI> replied, No, he doth not live with a Butcher, but he lives with a Painter, who lives within a few Doors of a Butcher; which Painter's Name was <HI>Roosevelt,</HI> to the best of the Witnesses Remembrance.</Q></P>
<Q><P>—That <HI>Cuffee</HI> told him, that <HI>Quack</HI> was married to the Negro Wench who is Cook to the Fort (to the Go∣vernor) as the Witness understood him.</P>
<P>—That <HI>Cuffee</HI> said, they were all (the Negroes as the Witness understood him) to meet at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s the Sun∣day after <HI>Quack</HI> was sworn, but some came and some did not.</P>
<P>—That the Witness asked <HI>Cuffee,</HI> how <HI>Quack</HI> did do it? (meaning the setting Fire to the Fort) That <HI>Cuffee</HI> answered, he could not tell how he did it; but that <HI>Quack was to do it, and did do it.</HI>—</P>
<P>—That <HI>Cuff</HI> said, they were to meet and have a Club at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s in the Easter Hollidays, but that the d—d Constables hindered them.—</P>
<P>—That the Witness further asked <HI>Cuffee,</HI> whether he did not think that the Firing would be sound out? and <HI>Cuffee</HI> replied, No, by G-d, he did not think it ever would.</P>
<P>—That the Witness asked <HI>Cuffee,</HI> whether he was not afraid that the two Negroes who were to be executed the next Monday, would not discover the Fires about the Fort and Town? <HI>Cuffee</HI> answered, he was not afraid of that, for that <HI>he was sure they would be burnt to Ashes be∣fore they would discover it, he would lay his Life on it.</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="005413_0046_101739ABDBA68D60"/>
—That afterwards, upon further Discourse with <HI>Cuffee,</HI> he said, he wondered why they only took up the <HI>Long Bridge B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, and not those of the Smith's Fly;</HI> for he said, he believed, if the Truth was known, <HI>the Smith's Fly Negroes</HI> were as much concerned as the others.—</P>
<P>—That <HI>Cuffee</HI> said to the Witness, he knew he was to suffer Death, and wondered why they did not bring him to his Tryal; for he was sure he was to go the Way the other Two went; meaning (as he understood him) the Negroes <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Prince</HI> hanged.—</P>
<P>—That after <HI>Quack,</HI> the other Prisoner at the Bar, was committed, <HI>Cuffee</HI> never mentioned any Thing con∣cerning the former Discourse to the Witness; but read, sometimes, and cried very much.</P></Q>
<P><HI>SARAH HIGGINS</HI> said, <Q>That on Sunday Afternoon, the Day before Col. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Storehouse was set on Fire, she saw four Negroes lurking about the Gar∣den behind that Storehouse, but she knew but one of them, and him only by Sight, which was <HI>Cuffee,</HI> the Prisoner at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.—</Q></P>
<Q><P>—That in the Dusk of the Evening, she saw four Negroes in the same Garden again; and they seemed to keep mostly about <HI>Kipp'</HI>s Brewhouse, which was on the Side of the Garden opposite to the said Storehouse; they shuffled about as tho' they would hide themselves: She distinguished <HI>Cuffee</HI> to be one<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Fortune'<HI>s Examination,</HI> NUMB.

<P>—The said <HI>Cuffee</HI> had come several Times to the House where she used to live, but she did not know be∣fore then, who he belonged to.—</P></Q>
<P><HI>JOHN PETERSON</HI> said, <Q>That when Col. <HI>Philipse's</HI> Storehouse was on fire, he went to assist there, and coming up to it, he met <HI>Cuffee</HI> (PHILIPSE's) coming out of the Door of the Storehouse, and he asked <HI>Cuff,</HI> what he did there? <HI>Cuff</HI> swore a great Oath, and said, <HI>The People were looking for Negroes.</HI> That the Witness had a Bucket of Water in his Hand, and gave it to <HI>Cuff,</HI> and bid him hand it; and he took the Bucket from the Witness: That <HI>Cuff</HI> had a blue Coat on lined or faced with red; and he knew his Voice very well when he answered him. The Witness said, he used to work for <HI>Cuff'</HI>s Master, and knew the Negro very well.—</Q></P>
<Q><P>—That after the Fire at the Storehouse was extin∣guished, and the People were drawn away from thence by a new Cry of <HI>Fire,</HI> Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> (Cuff's Master) and Mr. <HI>Chambers</HI> were standing together in the Garden near the Storehouse; and some body came up and told Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> that they had taken <HI>Cuff</HI> out of his House and were carrying him to Jail; and that it was he that had set the Fire: Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> made Answer, How can that be; I left him at home at Work making a Vane for the Boat? That he the Witness standing near by and hearing that, said, I am sure I saw him here just now at the Fire and spoke to him, and he answered me; and I handed him a Bucket of Water.</P></Q>
<P><HI>JACOBUS STOUTENBURGH</HI> said, <Q>That he had known the Prisoner <HI>(Cuffee)</HI> by Sight a long Time, but did not know who he belonged to.</Q></P>
<Q><P>That he (the Witness) went to assist at the Fire at Mr. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Storehouse; and when that Fire was extinguished, he was at the Top of the Roof, when there was another Alarm of <HI>Fire,</HI> which drew most of the People away from thence; when some Body cried out, <HI>there were Negroes in the Storehouse;</HI> and there being a great many Shingles pulled off the Roof, he could see down into them, and he espied out <HI>Cuff</HI> in the Storehouse next to that on fire; and he was letting himself down through the Laths in order to catch him, but he was hindered by a Nail catching hold of his Breeches, or he believed he had taken him; that he saw him leap out of the Window at the End of the Storehouse, and so made haste away, leaping over several Garden Fences, and made his Escape; that then the Witness went back with the Fire-Engines towards the City-Hall, and he heard the People say, they had got the Negro; and then he said, if it was the same Negro he should know him again; and there was a great Crowd of People bringing him to Jail; and when the Witness saw him, he knew him to be the same <HI>(Cuffee)</HI> the Prisoner at the Bar.</P></Q>
<P><HI>ISAAC GARDNER</HI> said, <Q>he saw <HI>Cuffee,</HI> the Prisoner at the Bar, at the Fire at the Fort; the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were Rows made of People in the Garden, Negroes as well as white Men, from the Water Side thro' the Sally Port, in order to hand Water along to the Fire; and the Witness observed, that when the Buckets come to <HI>Cuffee,</HI> instead of handing them along to the next Man, he put them upon the Ground, and overse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, by which Means the Ground which was at first dry and hard, be∣came so wet, that the Witness, who stood next him, was almost up to the Ankles in Mud; and that the

Witness then observed <HI>Cuff</HI> when the Flames of the House bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed up very high, he huzzah'd, danced, whi∣stled and sung<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that the Witness said to him, You black Dog, is this a Time for you to dance and make game upon such a sad Accident: and he only laughed and whispered to <HI>Albany</HI> (Mrs. <HI>Carpenter'</HI>s Negro) who stood next him on the other Side: Whereupon the Witness seeing Col. <HI>Moore,</HI> he said to him, he wished he would speak to those Negroes, who only laughed, and made Game whenever he forbid them oversetting the Water; and that Col. <HI>Moore</HI> did speak to them; but after his Back was turned, they went on again in the same Man∣ner, and so continued 'til they broke up from the Fire.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Evidence affecting both Prisoners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>DANIEL GAUTIER,</HI> Carpenter, said, <Q>That he was one of the first who went up to the Fort upon the Alarm of the Fire; when he came up towards it, he observed that great Part of the Outside of the Roof was covered with Smoke, but none for a considera∣ble Distance from the End next the Chappel; when he came upon the Ramparts next the Chappel, he was asking how it came, and was told it was occasioned by the Plummer's carrying his Fire-Pot into the Gutter, which he was mending between the House and the Chappel (as it was a Leaden Gutter which the Plummer had been foddering to stop a Leak) and some Sparks of the Fire had blown out of the Pot and catched the Shingles; whereupon the Witness seeing a Ladder set up against the Gutter, he went up, and looking in at the dormant Window at the End of the House towards the Chappel, he saw the Inside of the Garret Roof in a Blaze, but there was no Fire-within (he believes) Twenty Foot of the End he looked in at; wherefore he was then of Opinion it could not have been occasioned by the Plum∣mer's working there; for when the Fire broke out at the Top of the Roof, it was, as he thought, Twenty Foot from the End next the Gutter; and he observed the Fire broke out in several Places further; and the Witness said, that upon his first View of it, he gave the House over for lost.</Q></P>
<Q><P><HI>HILLIARD</HI> the Plummer said, That he thought the Fire could not have been occasioned by his working there; for that he was very careful of the Fire he carried up, and he had a Soldier to attend him; that his Fire-Pot was set on a Board which laid over the Gutter from the Chappel to the House, but was much lower than the dormant Window; that he did not think that any Spark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Fire did fly out of the Fire-Pot; for it was an inclosed Pot like a Dark Lanthorn, with an Opening only before to put his Soddering-Iron in, and that he was careful to place the Back of it toward, the Wind: That the Fire was on the other Side of the Roof, not near where he was at work.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> observed, That by an Act of Assembly of this Province, as in all other His Majesty's Colonies where there are Negroes, the Negroes Evidence is good against each other; and he read the particular Clauses in the Act to this Purpose, and further remarked upon the Reasona∣bleness and Necessity of this Law.</P>

<P><HI>Negro Evidence affecting Cuffee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>FORTUNE</HI> (WILKINS's Negro) said, <Q>That on Sunday the Day before Col. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Storehouse in New-Street, was set on fire, being sent by his Master towards Evening, on an Errand to their Apprentice Boy, who lived in the Broad-Way, he went by the Way of New-Sreet, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saw <HI>Cuffee,</HI> and spoke with him, and that he said he was going to one of his Master's Store∣houses; on which they parted; and the Witness went to the Broad-Way, and tarried there 'til it was duskish; that he returned the same Way, and as he came by the House of Capt. <HI>Phoenix,</HI> at the Corner of New-Street, he saw <HI>Cuffee</HI> again, and two Negroes more at some small Distance from him, but who they were knew not; that he spoke with <HI>Cuffee,</HI> and asked him what he did there so late? he answered, he waited there for his Master, who wanted something out of the Storehouse; and that he was to come and bring the Key with him; on which they parted again: But the Witness believed one of the other two Negroes was a Spaniard, because when he left <HI>Cuffee,</HI> he heard one of them call him, <HI>Venez a qui Seignior.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Witness said, <Q>That he had been often asked by <HI>Caesar</HI> (VAARCK's) <HI>Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> (AUBOYNEAU's) and <HI>Cuffee</HI> the Prisoner, to go with them to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s; but that he never did, but was told they had a Dance there every other Night.</Q></P>

<P><HI>Negro Evidence against Quack.</HI></P>
<P><HI>FORTUNE,</HI> (WILKINS's) said, <Q>That <HI>Quack,</HI> about a Week or Ten Days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Fort was burnt, (being on a Sunday Afternoon) desired the Witness to take a Walk with him; and that he went with him into the Common; where <HI>Quack</HI> left him a little while, and went down into the Swamp, near the Powder House, where he gathered something and returned to him again.</Q></P>
<Q><P>That when he came back, the Witness a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed him what he had got? He answered, he would not tell him; but then asked the Witness to go down with him to the Fort, and said he would give him some Punch: That accordingly the Witness went with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Fort; though he did not go very willingly.</P>
<P>That when they came to the Fort, <HI>Quack</HI> carried him into the Kitchen, where he kept him 'til it began to grow dark; and when the Witness told him he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be going; for that the Watch would take him up: <HI>Quack</HI> answered, there was no Danger of that.</P>
<P>That <HI>Quack</HI> gave him no Punch at the Fort, but asked him to drink a Dram; which he refused; and so both came away from thence together, keeping Company 'till they came to Captain <HI>Pearse'</HI>s House, where they parted; the Witness returning home, and <HI>Quack,</HI> as the Witness believed, went back to the Fort.</P>
<P>This was all that passed between the Witness and <HI>Quack</HI> at their first Meeting, on Sunday Afternoon.</P>
<P>That about three Days after that, the Witness met <HI>Quack</HI> again, near Mrs. <HI>Carpenter'</HI>s, where <HI>Quack</HI> asked the Witness, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was in such Haste when he was last at the Fort▪ To which the Witness answered, that he was afraid of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Watch: <HI>Quack</HI> replied, there was no Fear of that, and invited him to come to see him again at the Fort; but the Witness refused, say∣ing that he had promised him Punch before, and gave him none.</P>
<P>That about two Days before the Fort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> burnt, he met <HI>Quack</HI> again near Mrs. <HI>Richets'</HI>s, where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Witness. <HI>That in a few Days there would be great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Fort:</HI> The Witness asked him, What Alterations?

That the Witness did ask <HI>Niblet'</HI>s Negro, Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was to burn the Fort? To which he answered, <HI>Quack, himself (Sandy)</HI> and GOMEZ's <HI>Cuffee,</HI> they would do it.</P>
<P>That the next Day after the Fire at the Fort, the Wit∣ness met <HI>Sandy</HI> (NIBLET's Negro) who said to him, <HI>We have done the Business;</HI> and the same Day the Witness met <HI>Quack,</HI> who likewise said to him, <HI>The Business is done:</HI> Thereupon the Witness asked him, <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Business?

<P><HI>SANDY,</HI> alias <HI>Sawney</HI> (NIBLET's Negro) said, <Q>That about three Weeks before the Fire at the Fort, <HI>Quack</HI> asked him, <HI>to set the Fort on Fire?</HI> and he the Witness answered, No, he would not run the Risque of being hanged; but that he might go to H—ll and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> d—d That then <HI>Quack</HI> said, he would do it himself.</Q></P>

<Q><P>That the Day the Fort va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fired, he stood Sentry at the Gate about Eleven o'Clock in the Morning, a little before or after; and that <HI>Quack</HI> came up to the Gate and offered to come in; the Witness said, he knew that the Governor had some Time before forbid him coming to the Fort, and therefore he scrupled to let him in; <HI>Quack</HI> answered, that he was free now and had Liberty to come; and so he let him past.</P>
<P>That not long before that, the Witness was posted one Night at the same Gate, and <HI>Quack</HI> (the Prisoner) came up in order to go to the Governor's House; and the Witness knew that the Governor had before then lately forbid him coming there; and therefore opposed his Entrance within the Gate; but <HI>Quack</HI> was resolute, and pushed forward whether he would or no, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and said he would go in: The Witness then bid him take what followed, and clubbed his Firelock and knocked him down: That then <HI>Quack</HI> got up again and collar'd the Witness, and cried out <HI>Murder;</HI> and the Witness was going to strike him again, and the Officer of the Guard hearing a Bustle, called to the Witness, and forbid him striking him any more; and <HI>Quack</HI> then run in a-Doors into the Governor's Kitchen; and they went and fetched him, and turned him out of the Fort.</P></Q>

<Q><P><HI>May it please your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury▪</HI></P>
<P>THE Part assigned to me on this Trial, is to sum up the Evidence which you have heard: And in general it may be observed, that a most horrid Conspi∣racy has been formed, <HI>to burn this City, and to destroy the White People.</HI></P>
<P>That great Numbers of Persons have been concerned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Plot; some <HI>Whites,</HI> and many <HI>Blacks,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Place of their general Rendezvous was the House of <HI>John Hughson.</HI> That there Thirty Negroes have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at a Time.

<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>No Scheme more monstrous could have been invented; nor can any Thing be thought of more foolish, than the Motives that induced these Wretches to enter into it!

That these Slaves should thereby establish themselves in Peace and Freedom in the plunder'd Wealth of their slaughter'd Masters! 'Tis hard to say whether <HI>the Wickedness</HI> or <HI>the Folly</HI> of this Design is the Greater: And had it not been in Part executed before it was discovered; we should with great Difficulty have been persuaded to believe it possible, that such a <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>foolish Plot</HI> could be contrived by any Creatures in Human Shape.</P>
<P>Yet, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> INCREC<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>BLE as such a Plot would have seemed to have been, the Event has in Part proved it to be REAL. Whence else could so many Fires have been lighted up all around you in so short a Time, with evident Marks of wilful Design? A Design that could not be executed but by several Hands.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the Prisoners at the Bar stand charged with being principal Parties in this TRAGICAL DESIGN, and two of the prime Incendiaries; <HI>Quack</HI> for <HI>burning his Majesty's House in the Fort,</HI> and <HI>Cuffee</HI> for <HI>burning Col.</HI> Philipse'<HI>s Storehouse.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="43" REF="005413_0050_101739B9ED6E10E0"/>
Afterwards Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> proceeded to observe on the several Parts of the Evidence against each of the Prisoners; particularly to shew, that <HI>Cuffee</HI> was one of the first of the Negroes that were sworn into the Plot to <HI>burn</HI> and <HI>murder;</HI> That he appeared one of the most forward and active in promoting it; That Mr. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Storehouse by diverse Circumstances appeared to have been wilfully set on fire; That the Prisoner declared that he would burn that Storehouse; That he was seen there before the Fire broke out, in a suspicious Appearance, and was present at the Time of it; and at the Cry of some Person, that Negroes were in the Storehouse, the Prisoner jumped out of a Window, leaped over two Fences and ran away, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That he seemed exceedingly well pleased with the Fire at the Fort; overset the Buckets that were fill'd with Water, and did what he could to prevent the Extinguishing of that Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then inferred from the Facts proved, and Circumstances attending them, that there appeared <HI>violent Presumption</HI> of Guilt, which the Law esteems FULL PROOF.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Quack</HI> he observed, that the Witnesses proved that <HI>Quack</HI> was sworn into the Conspiracy, and particularly that he had agreed to burn the Fort; that he repeatedly said he would do it; That the Fire where it broke out could not easily be accounted for from any accidental Cause; That the Prisoner had confessed the Crime both before he was apprehended and since he had been in Jail: All which amount to FULL PROOF.</P>
<P>The particular Remarks on the Testimony of the Wit∣nesses to the several Points before mentioned, are here omitted for the Sake of Brevity, and because the Substance of the Evidence is before related.</P>
<P>Then concluded,</P>
<Q><P>Thus, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I have distinguished the several Points of the Evidence against the Prisoners, and have repeated the Substance of what each Witness has said to each Point, and shall leave it to you to determine whether the Prisoners are guilty or not. I have endea∣voured to lay no more Weight upon any Part of the Evidence, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it will well bear; and I hope I have not urged any Consequence which the Fact proved will not fairly warrant.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> The Prisoners have been indulged with the same Kind of Trial as is due to <HI>Freemen,</HI> though they might have been proceeded against in a more summary and less favourable Way. The Negro Evidence, in the Maner in which it has been produced, is warranted by the Act of Assembly that has been read to you: The Law requires no Oath to be administered to them; and indeed it would seem to be a Profanation of it, to ad∣minister it to a Heathen in the legal Form. You have seen that the Court has put them under the most solemn Caution, that their small Knowledge of Religion can render them capable of.—The Being and Perfections of an ALMIGHTY, ALL KNOWING and JUST GOD, and the Terrors of an eternal World, have been plainly laid before them, and strongly pressed upon them. Unless they were professed Christians, and had taken upon them the Bonds and Obligations of that Religion, <HI>their Word</HI> with the <HI>Cautions</HI> that have been used, I suppose will be thought by you, as satisfactory as any Oath that could have been devised, But, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the Court has no Power to administer an Oath but in the common Form: And if Pagan Negroes could not be received as Witnesses against each other▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> legal Form; it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that the greatest Villanies would often pass with Impunity.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I can't help observing to you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that by divers Parts of the Evidence, it appears that this horrid <HI>Scene of Iniquity</HI> has been chiefly con∣trived and promoted at Meetings of Negroes in great Numbers on <HI>Sundays.</HI> This instructive Circumstance may teach US many Lessons both of Reproof and Caution; which I only hint at, and shall leave the Deduction of the Particulars to every one's Reflection.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>The monstrous Ingratitude of this black Tribe, is what exceedingly aggravates their Guilt. Their Slavery among us is generally softned with great Indulgence. They live without Care; and are commonly better fed and cloathed, and put to less Labour, than the <HI>Poor</HI> of most Christian Countries. They are indeed <HI>Slaves,</HI> but under the Protection of the Law: None can hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t them with Impunity. They are really more happy in this Place, than in the Midst of the continual Plunder, Cruelty and Rapine of their Native Countries: But Notwith∣standing all the Kindness and Tenderness with which they have been treated amongst us; yet this is the second Attempt of the same Kind, that this brutish and bloody Species of Mankind have made within one Age.<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alluding to the Negro Plot in</HI> 1712, <HI>before noted upon</HI> Peggy'<HI>s Examination,</HI> NUMB.

to all that had come after them: But I fear, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that we shall never be quite safe, 'til that wicked Race are under more Restraint, or their Number greatly reduced within this City. But I shall not insist further, but refer you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> to the Direction of the Court; and if the Evidence against these Prisoners proves sufficient in your Judgment to convict them, I make no doubt but you will bring in a Verdict accordingly, and do what in you lies to rid this Country of some of the vilest Creatures in it.</P></Q>
<P>Then the Jury were charged, and a Constable was sworn to attend them as usual; and they withdrew; and being soon returned, found the Prisoners Guilty of both Indictments.</P>
<P>The Prisoners were asked, What they had to offer in Arrest of Judgment, why they should not receive Sentence of Death? And they offering nothing but Repetitions of Protestations of their Innocence;</P>
<P>The THIRD JUSTICE proceeded to Sentence, as fol∣loweth.</P>
<P><HI>Quack and Cuffee, the Criminals at the Bar:</HI></P>
<Q><P>YOU both now stand convicted of one of the most horrid and detestable▪ Pieces of Villainy, that ever Satan instilled into the Heart of human Creatures to put in Practice: <HI>Ye,</HI> and the rest of your Colour, tho' you are called Slaves in this Country; yet are you all far, very far, from the Condition of other Slaves in other Coun∣tries; nay, your Lot is superiour to that of Thousands of white People: You are furnished with all the Neces∣saries of Life, Meat, Drink and Cloathing, without Care, in a much better Manner than you could provide for yourselves, were you at Liberty; as the miserable Condition of many Free People here of your Complexion might abundantly convince you: What then could prompt you to undertake so vile, so wicked, so mon∣strous, so execrable and hellish a Scheme, as to murder and destroy your own Masters and Benefactors? Nay to destroy, Root and Branch, <HI>all the White People of this Place, and to lay the whole Town in Ashes.</HI></P>
<P>I know not which is the more astonishing, the extreme <HI>Folly,</HI> or <HI>Wickedness,</HI> of so base and shocking a Conspiracy; for as to any View of Liberty or Govern∣ment you could propose to yourselves, upon the Success of burning the City, robbing, butchering and destroying the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nhabitants; what could it be expected to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd in, in the Account of any rational and considerate Person among you, but your own Destruction? And as to the Wicked∣ness of it, you might well have reflected, you that have Sense, that there is a GOD above, who has always a clear View of all your Actions; who sees into the most secret Recesses of the Heart, and knoweth all your Thoughts; shall he not, do <HI>ye</HI> think, for all this bring you into Judgment; at that final and great Day of Account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Day of Judgment, when the most secret Treachery will be disclosed, and laid open to the View; and every one will be rewarded according to their Deeds, and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that Degree of Reason, which God Almighty has entrusted them with.</P>
<P><HI>Ye</HI> that were for destroying us without Mercy; <HI>Ye</HI> abject Wretches, the Outcasts of the Nations of the Earth, are treated here with Tenderness and Humanity; and, I wish I could not say, with too great Indulgence also; for <HI>You</HI> have grown wanton with Excess of Liberty, and your Idleness has proved your Ruin; having given you the Opportunities of forming this villainous and detestab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Conspiracy; a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cheme compounded of the foulest a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> blackest Vices, Treachery, Blood-thirstiness &amp; Ingratitude.—But be not deceived, God Almighty only can, and will proportion Punishments to Men's Offences; <HI>Ye</HI> that have shewn no Mercy here, and have been for destroying all about <HI>ye,</HI> and involving them in one General Massacre and Ruin, What Hopes can <HI>ye</HI> have of Mercy in the other World? For <HI>shall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right?</HI> Let me in Compassion advise <HI>ye</HI> then; There are but a few Moments between <HI>ye</HI> and Eternity; <HI>Ye</HI> ought therefore seriously to lay to Heart these Things; earnestly and sorrowfully to bewail your mon∣strous and crying Sins, in this your Extremity; and if <HI>ye</HI> would reasonably entertain any Hopes of Mercy at the Hands of GOD, <HI>ye</HI> must shew Mercy here yourselves, and make what Amends <HI>ye</HI> can before <HI>ye</HI> leave us, for the Mischief you have already done, by preventing any more being done.—Do not flatter yourselves, for the same Measure which you give us here, will be mea∣sured to you again in the other World: <HI>Ye</HI> must con∣fess your whole Guilt, as to the Offences of which <HI>ye</HI> stand convicted, and for which <HI>ye</HI> will presently receive Judgment: <HI>Ye</HI> must discover the whole Scene of Ini∣qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y which has been contrived in this monstrous Con∣federacy, the chief Authors and Actors, and all and every the Parties concerned, aiding and assisting therein, that by your Means a full stop may be put to this horrible and devilish Undertaking. And these are the only Means left <HI>ye</HI> to shew Mercy; and the only reasonable Grounds <HI>ye</HI> can go upon, to entertain any Hopes of Mercy at the Hands of GOD, before whose Judgment Seat <HI>Ye</HI> are soon to appear.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="005413_0052_101739C1840F1BB8"/>
<HI>Ye</HI> cannot be so stupid surely, as to imagine, That when <HI>ye</HI> leave this World, when your Souls put off these Bodies of Clay, <HI>Ye</HI> shall <HI>become like the Beasts that perish; that your Spirits shall only vanish into the soft Air, and cease to be:</HI> No, your Souls are immortal; they will live forever, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be eternally happy, or eternally miserable in the other World, where you are now going.</P>
<P>If <HI>ye</HI> sincerely and in earnest repent you of your abo∣minable Sins▪ and implore the divine Assistance at this critical▪Juncture, in working out the great and momen∣tous Article of the Salvation of your Souls; upon your making all the Amends, and giving all the Satisfaction which is in each of your Powers, by a full and compleat Discovery of the Conspiracy, and of the several Persons concerned in it, as I have observed to <HI>ye</HI> before; then and only upon these Conditions, can <HI>ye</HI> reasonably ex∣pect Mercy at the Hands of God Almighty, for your poor, wretched and miserable Souls.</P>
<P>Here <HI>ye</HI> must have Justice; for the Justice of human Laws has at length overtaken <HI>ye;</HI> and we ought to be very thankful, and esteem it a most merciful and won∣drous Act of Providence, that your Treacheries and Vil∣lainies have been discovered; that your Plot and Con∣trivances, your hidden Works of Darkness have been brought to Light, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opt in their Carreer; <HI>That in the same Not which you have hid so privily for others▪ your own Feet are taken; That the same Mischief which you have contriv'd for others▪ and have in Part executed, is at length fallen upon your own Pates;</HI> whereby the Sentence which I am now to pronounce, will be justified against <HI>ye</HI>▪ which is.</P>
<P>That you and each of you be carried from hence to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, where you and each of you shall be chained to a Stake, and burnt to Death.</P>
<P>And the Lord have Mercy upon your poor, wretched Souls.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That the Execution of the said <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Cuffee</HI> be on Saturday the 30th of this Instant, between the Hours of One and Seven o'Clock in the Afternoon of the same Day.</P>

<P>THIS Day <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Cuffee</HI> were executed at the Stake according to Sentence.</P>

<P>After these Confessions were minuted down (which were taken in the Midst of great Noise and Confusion) Mr. <HI>Moore</HI> desired the Sheriff to delay the Execution—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il the Governor could be acquainted therewith, and his Pleasure known touching their Reprieve; which, could it have been effected, 'twas thought might have been a Means of pro∣ducing great Discoveries: But from the Disposition observed in the Spectators, 'twas much to be apprehended, there would have been great Difficulty, if not Danger, in an Attempt to take the Criminals back. All this was repre∣sented to his Honour: And before Mr. <HI>Moore</HI> could return from him to the Place of Execution, he met the Sheriff upon the Common, who declared his Opinion, that the carrying the Negroes back would be impracticable; and if that was his Honour's Order, it could not be attempted without a strong Guard, which could not be got time enough: And His Honour's Directions for the Reprieve being Conditional and Discretionary; for these Reasons the Execution proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>Cuffee,</HI> from the Course of the Evidence, was one of principal Negroes who was first initiated into this detestable Enterprize; one that <HI>Hughson,</HI> no doubt, found so thorough∣ly qualified for his Purpose, that he might put more than ordinary Confidence in him, and entrust him with a greater Share of this Infernal Secret than others of his Colour;
<PB N="48" REF="005413_0055_101739CE688E1868"/>
but more especially as to the Parties Blacks and Whites engaged in it. It was notorious <HI>Cuff</HI> had a great deal of idle Time upon his Hands; perhaps more than a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Negro in Town; consequently was much at large for making frequent daily or nightly Visits at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s the head Lodge, where these Deeds of Darkness and Inhumanity were brooding; and therefore indeed must of Course have become personally acquainted with a greater Number of the Con∣spirators, than others who had fewer of the like Oppor∣tunities.</P>
<P><HI>Quack</HI> had a Master who kept him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> employed, a Days at least, and it seems he was a much later Conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; for <HI>Cuff</HI> in his Discourse with <HI>Arthur Price</HI> about <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Person that set Fire to the Fort.</HI> [<HI>See</HI> Price'<HI>s Deposition again,</HI> NUMB. III. § 1. 12<HI>th May:</HI> For the manner of this Secret's bolting from <HI>Cuff</HI> to a Fellow-Prisoner, as there related, is somewhat remarkable, and may be very apt to induce one's Credit] <HI>Price</HI> having told <HI>Cuff.</HI> <Q>That he had heard Peggy <HI>had discovered about the Fire at the Fort,</HI> Cuff replyed, <HI>She could not do that unless she for swore herself, he knew; for he that had done that was sworn</HI></Q> [perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s meant <HI>into the Conspiracy</HI> also, but at least he must mean <HI>to do that Fact] "after Peggy was in Prison."</HI> And so <HI>Cuff</HI> goes on and tells the Circumstances of his meeting <HI>Quack</HI> (it should seem according to Appointment) and carrying him down to <HI>Hughson</HI>'s and <HI>Hughson</HI>'s swearing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> three Times (to make sure of him)—This could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een long before the <HI>Fort</HI> was burnt down. For <HI>Peggy</HI> was Committed on the 4th <HI>March,</HI> and the <HI>Fort</HI> burnt the 18th, but intended for the 17th at Night; and by <HI>Cuff'</HI>s saying, <Q><HI>She could not do that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>less she forswore herself, he knew.</HI></Q> i. e. (<HI>Cuff</HI> must mean) She could not discover the Person who set Fire to the <HI>Fort.—Quack</HI> must therefore have been engaged in this wicked Purpose, but a little before he put it in Execution; and tho' <HI>Hughson and his Advisers,</HI> might have known long before, that <HI>Quack</HI> was a fit Tool for them, and as such make very much of him, because he had Pretensions to go to the <HI>Fort,</HI> and stay there a-Nights with his Wife; and tho' probably he might have been en∣gaged and <HI>sworn</HI> into the General Design of the Conspiracy (which was the Artifice, it seems, they constantly practised upon a Negro's saying <HI>Yes.</HI> i.e. consenting to their abomina∣ble Proposals) yet they might not think it so safe to attempt the Engaging him for this particular Fact, long before the Time calculated for the Execution of it; for they might apprehend some Danger in that: During a long Interval, there would have been more Hazard of his talking of it, and perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to his Wife; who, if she had any Influence over him; and had happened to have a Grain of Honesty, or Gratitude towards her Master and his Family, she possibly might have persuaded him to make a Merit to them both, of de∣tecting this infernal Confederacy; and <HI>therefore,</HI> it seems most propable the Devil and his Agents deferred the At∣tempting his Resolution upon this grand Article, till some short Time before the Execution of it; if they found <HI>Quack</HI> of a pliable Disposition, they might think if they could upon a Surprize, fix him in the Persuasion that such an Oath was at all Obligatory; by the Reitterating of it, they might make the deeper Impression upon him, and fix him the more firmly, and that there would be less Hazard of his Failure in the Engagement, the shorter Time he had to cool and deliberate upon it.</P>
<P>Both these Criminals declare their Opinions. That Hugh∣son <HI>was the first Contriver and Promoter of the Conspiracy,</HI> so far as they knew of the Matter: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <HI>first</HI> Promoter as to them, they were sure of: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Cuff</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it <HI>several years before,</HI> as will appear hereafter. But if the foregoing Reflections are right, surely they import a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Policy beyond what could be expected from <HI>an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Cobler,</HI> Hughson!</P>
<P>However, from these Confessions, there was another Satisfaction beyond these Criminals Acknowledgment of their own Guilt, that the Testimony o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Mary Burton, Sandy</HI> and <HI>Fortune,</HI> Negroes, Witnesses upon their Tryal, (upon the Credit whereof chiefly these Criminals were convicted) was by them particularly and expresly confirmed in the Midst of Flames, which is the highest Attestation: And by Consequence from the Whole. <HI>Arthur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ice's</HI> also; who was the First that gave Information that <HI>Quack</HI> was the Person who set Fire to the <HI>Fort,</HI> and <HI>Cuffee</HI> had told him so.</P>

<P N="5">5.

Whereupon <HI>Hughson</HI> asked if there was a Bible, and desired that he might be sworn: He was told, that no Oath would be administered to him; if he had any Thing to say, he had free Liberty to speak; <HI>but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wanted very much to be sworn:</HI> The Recorder thereupon reproached him with his wicked Life and Practices, debauching and corrupting of Negroes, and encouraging them to steal and pilfer from their Masters and others; and for shewing his Children so wicked an Example, training them up in the High-Way to Hell: He further observed to him, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>his Wife, and Peggy,</HI> then stood convicted of a Felony for receiving stolen Goods of Negroes; and that now nothing remained but to pass Sentence of Death upon them, and to appoint a Day for their Execution for that Fact; but that it was now determined, that <HI>he, his Wife and Daughter, and Peggy,</HI> should also be tried for being confederated in this most horrible Conspiracy; that the Evidence would appear so strong and clear against them in this Particular, that there was little doubt of their being all convicted upon that Head also; that it would appear undeniably that he was a Principal, and head Agent in this detestable Scheme of Villany; the chief Abettor, together with the rest of his Family, of this execrable and monstrous Contrivance for shedding the Blood of his Neighbours, and laying the whole City in Ashes, upon the Expectation of enriching himself by such an inhuman and execrable Undertaking: He therefore admonished him, if he would entertain the least Hopes of recommending himself to the Mercy of God Almighty, before whose Tribunal he must soon appear, that he would ingenuously tell the Truth, and lay open the whole Scene of this dark Tragedy, which had been brood∣ing at his House; and discover the several Parties he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w to have been engaged in it; in doing which he would make some Attonement for his past Villanies, by preventing that Slaughter, Bloodshed and Devastation which he and his Confederates had intended; Or the Recorder expressed himself in Words to this Purpose. But hereupon <HI>Hughson</HI> put on a <HI>soft smiling Air of Innocence upon his Counte∣nance,</HI> again desiring that he might be sworn; which was refused him; and he then declared, he knew Nothing at all of any Conspiracy; and called God to witness his Protestations, that he was as innocent with respect to that Charge as the Child unborn, and also <HI>his Wife, Daughter,</HI> and <HI>Peggy</HI> for aught he knew.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Recorder remanded him to Jail.</P>
<P>Whether the Man was struck with a Compunction, or flattered himself with making a Merit by his Discovery, and thereby recommend himself to Mercy, and that he should so save his Life; or whether he imagined, that if he could be sworn, and then make the most solemn Pro∣testations with the Sanction of an Oath; that this would give such strong Impressions of his Innocence, as might

make Way for his Escape▪ what his View was ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only be guessed at: But several who were by him in the Jail when he expressed his Desire of having the Opportunity of speaking with the Judges, as above mentioned, concluded from his Condition and Behaviour at that Instant, that he was then really in Earnest to lay open this Scene of Villany; but 'twas thought that in two or three Hours afterwards, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wife or others had got the better of him, and prevailed with him to change his Mind, and desist from his former Resolution.</P>

<P>The Substance of the Three Indictments followeth.</P>
<P>The FIRST INDICTMENT sets forth, That <HI>Hughson,</HI> his <HI>Wife,</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> and also three Negroes, to wit▪ <HI>Caesar, Prince</HI> and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> had on the third Day of March then last past, entered into a most detestable and felonious Conspiracy, Combination and Confederacy with each other, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> set on fire and burn the House of our Lord the KING,</HI> which then was standing and being at the Fort within this City; <HI>and also this whole Town, and to kill and destroy the Inhabitants thereof:</HI> And that they had feloniously and of their Malice aforethought, procured, abetted, counselled and encouraged divers Negroes and other Persons to the Jurors then unknown, to set on fire, burn and consume the King's House, and divers other Houses and Buildings within this City: And that the said Negroes and other Persons then unknown, in Pursuance of their being so procured, abetted, counselled and encouraged as afore∣said, by <HI>Hughson,</HI> his <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> and <HI>Caesar, Prince,</HI> and <HI>Cuffee;</HI> voluntarily, feloniously and of their Malice afore∣thought, and with Intent to burn down and consume the greater Part of this Town; had set on fire <HI>the King's House; the Dwelling-House of</HI> Agnes Hilton; <HI>the Storehouse of</HI> Frederick Philipse, <ABBR><HI>Esq;</HI></ABBR> and divers other Houses and Buildings within this City: And that <HI>the King's House being so set on fire, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s burnt down and consumed;</HI> and that the said Dwelling-House, Storehouse, and other Houses, being so set on fire as aforesaid, were in Part burnt down and consumed.</P>
<P>The SECOND INDICTMENT sets forth, That the Negro <HI>Quack,</HI> on the Eighteenth Day of <HI>March,</HI> in the Fourteenth Year of his Majesty's Reign, did of his Malice aforethought, wickedly, maliciously, voluntarily, wilfully and feloniously set on fire, burn, and wholly consume and destroy a certain Dwelling-House of Our Lord the King, which was then standing and being at the Fort within this City: And that <HI>Hughson,</HI> his <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Daughter,</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> before the Felony and Burning aforesaid was done and perpetrated, of their Malice afore∣thought, wickedly, maliciously, voluntarily, wilfully and feloniously, did counsel, abet, procure and encourage the said <HI>Quack,</HI> the Felony and Burning aforesaid committed and perpetrated, to commit and perpetrate. And▪</P>
<P>The THIRD INDICTMENT sets forth, That the Negro <HI>Cuffee,</HI> the sixth Day of <HI>April,</HI> in the Fourteenth Year of his Majesty's Reign, did, of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Malice afore∣thought, wickedly, maliciously, voluntarily, wilfully and feloniously set on fire and burn a certain House belonging to <HI>Frederick Philipse,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> which was then standing and being within this City: And that <HI>Hughson,</HI> his <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Daughter,</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> before the Felony and Burning aforesaid was done and perpetrated, of their Malice afore∣thought, wickedly, maliciously, voluntarily, wilfully and feloniously did counsel, abet, procure and encourage the said <HI>Cuffee,</HI> the Felony and Burning aforesaid committed and perpetrated, to commit and perpetrate, in most pernicious Example of all others in the like Cases offending; contrary to the Form of the Statutes in such Case made and provided,
<PB N="54" REF="005413_0061_101739DE83978288"/>
and against the Peace of Our Sovereign Lord the KING, his Crown and Dignity.</P>
<P>To which three several Indictments the Prisoners, De∣fendants in each<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">The First of these three Indictments <HI>for the Conspi∣racy was found against</HI> Hughson, his Wife, <HI>and Kerry, soon after their Conviction of having received stolen Goods, knowing them to have been such, and some Time before the Trial of the Negroes</HI> Quack <HI>and</HI> Cuffee; <HI>and before it was discovered that</HI> Quack <HI>had set fire to His Ma∣jesty's House in the Fort, or</HI> Cuffee <HI>to Mr.</HI> Phillipse'<HI>s Storehouse, or that</HI> Sarah (Hughson'<HI>s Daughter</HI>) <HI>was known to be a Party concerned in the Conspiracy.</HI></NOTE> have been arraigned, and thereto pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>The Attorney General, after opening to the Court and Jury the Charge against the Prisoners, proceeded as fol∣loweth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL, in the first Place, on the Trial of the Prisoners upon these Indictments, shew you, That the Negroes <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> mentioned in the Second and Third of them, have already been tried, found guilty, and executed for the Felonies and Burnings which these Indictments charge them to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en guilty of: That they confessed the same at the Place of their Exe∣cution; And <HI>that the Evidence which</HI> Mary Burton <HI>gave against them at their Trial, was true, in every Respect.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I am to shew you, what Share each of the Prisoners at the Bar had in these most horrible Felonies.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> as each of these four Criminals have acted their several Parts in this black, this monstrous, and tragical Scene; I shall begin with opening the Evi∣dence against the Three last named, that I may conclude with my Observations on the Charge against <HI>Hughson</HI> himself, and set him and his most detestable Actions in their proper Colours before you.</P>
<P>First then, I shall prove to you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> from full and clear Evidence, That these Prisoners are all Guilty of the whole Charge against them.—That they entered into a most wicked and hellish Plot to set on fire, and lay in Ashes the King's House, and this whole Town; and to kill and destroy the Inhabitants as they should come to secure their Effects, and extinguish the Flames.—That this dreadful Conspiracy took its first Rise at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House in this City.—<HI>That</HI> it was there formed, set on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and carried on:<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>From what had hitherto come to Light, it could be supposed no otherwise, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut that</HI> Hughson <HI>was the principal Contriver of this monstrous Scheme; but never∣theless, it was there principally hatched and brought to Maturity, as may be gathered from the Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of the Dis∣covery.</HI></NOTE> And that the Three last named Criminals, as well as <HI>Hughson</HI> himself, were all present at divers Meetings of great Numbers of Negroes, and the Rest of the Conspirators <HI>there</HI> for that Purpose.—That <HI>there</HI> these three Criminals were all sworn into this abominable Plot, and at those Meetings, joined with <HI>Hughson</HI> in exciting and encouraging <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> and the Rest of the Negroes, and other their wicked Confederates, to commit these execrable Felonies.</P>
<P>I shall now endeavour to represent to you the Part which <HI>Hughson</HI> himself has acted in this Tragedy.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>It will appear to you in the Course of the Evidence for the King upon this Trial, That <HI>John Hughson</HI> was the chief Contriver, Abettor, and Encourager of all this Mystery of Iniquity:—<HI>That it was He,</HI> who advised and procured secret and frequent Meetings of the Negroes, and the Rest of the Conspirators, at his House, there to form and carry on these horrible Conspiracies.—That it was <HI>he</HI> that swore the Negroes <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> with many others, and himself too, into this direful Plot.—<HI>That it was He</HI> who devised Firebrands, Death and De∣struction to be sent among you.—That it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who received of Negroes Twelve Pounds in Money—stolen Money, no doubt (and what he could not but know to be so) to buy Arms and Ammunition, to kill and destroy his Neighbours: <HI>And that He,</HI> in Pursuance thereof, made a Journey on Purpose to buy, and did procure Arms and Ammunition; and hid them in his House, against such Time as this unnatural and bloody Scheme should be ripe for Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such</HI> a Monster will <HI>this Hughson</HI> appear before you, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for sake of the Plunder he expected by setting in Flames the King's House, and this whole City, and by the Effusion of the Blood of his Neighbours▪—<HI>He</HI>—<HI>Murderous</HI> and <HI>Remorseless He!</HI>—counselled and en∣couraged the Committing of all these most astonishing Deeds of Darkness, Cruelty, and Inhumanity.—<HI>Infa∣mous Hughson!</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="005413_0062_101739E09DAA40E8"/>
<HI>Gentlemen▪ This is that Hughson!</HI> whose Name, and most detestable Conspiracies will no doubt be had in everlasting Remembrance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his eternal Reproach; and stand recorded to latest Posterity,—<HI>This</HI> is the Man!—<HI>his,</HI> that Grand Incendiary!—<HI>That</HI> Arch Rebel against God, his King, and his Country!—<HI>That Devil Incarnate!</HI> and chief Agent of the old <HI>Abaddon</HI> of the infernal Pit, and Regions of Darkness.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Behold</HI> the Author, and Abettor of all the late Con∣flagrations, Terrors, and Devastation that have befallen this City.—Was not <HI>this Hughson</HI> sunk below the Dig∣nity of human Nature!—Was he not abandoned to all Sense of Shame and Remorse!—To all Sense of <HI>Feeling</HI> the dreadful Calamities <HI>He</HI> has brought on this City, and his fellow Creatures; <HI>He</HI> would from a Consciousness of his own Guilt.—<HI>His monstrous Guilt!</HI>—be so con∣founded, as not able to look up, or stand without the greatest Confusion of Face, before this Court and Au∣dience; but would openly confess his, and the Rest of his wretched Confederates Guilt, and humbly ask Pardon of God, the King, and his injured Country.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>We shall now call, and examine the Witnesses, who will prove the Crimes charged upon each of these four Criminals; And when we have so done, I do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t but you will find of them Guilty.</P></Q>

<P>They had Nothing to ask.</P>
<P><HI>MARY BURTON</HI> called and sworn.</P>
<P>She said, <Q>That there were many Negroes frequently at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s at Nights, ever since she came to the House, eating and drinking; that she has seen Twenty and Thirty at a Time there; but most of a Sunday; that the Negroes used to bring Provisions there, particularly <HI>Carpenter's</HI> Negro;<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>His Mistress was a Butcher.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Hughson,</HI> his <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Daughter,</HI> and <HI>Peggy,</HI> used, at such Meetings, frequently to be amongst the Negroes; and that they talked of burning the Town and killing the People.</Q></P>
<P>[While <HI>Mary Burton</HI> was delivering her Evidence, <HI>Hughson</HI> and his <HI>Wife</HI> were crying and bemoaning themselves, and embracing and kissing their Daughter <HI>Sarah;</HI> and <HI>Hughson</HI> the Father intimated what Care they had taken in Catechizing her, and the rest of their Children, <HI>and teaching them to read the Bible,</HI> and breeding them up in the Fear of the Lord. And in order (as may be supposed) to move Compassion in the Court and Jury, <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Wife brought thither a Sucking Child at her Breast, which was ordered to be taken away.]</P>
<P><HI>Mary Burton</HI> further said, <Q>That at such great Meetings of Negroes at <HI>Hughson's, Caesar</HI> (VAARCK's) and <HI>Prince</HI> (AUBOYNEAU's) Negroes (that were hanged) and <HI>Cuffee</HI> (PHILIPSE's) were usually amongst them.</Q></P>
<Q><P>That <HI>Hughson</HI> SWORE the Negroes into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and the <HI>Hughsons</HI> swore themselves and <HI>Peggy;</HI> That one of <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Daughters carried a <HI>Bible up Stairs,</HI> and the <HI>Hughsons</HI> carried the Negroes into a private Room; and when they came down again to the rest of the Negroes, <HI>Hughson</HI> said, <HI>they were all sworn;</HI> but the Witness said, she did not see them sworn.</P></Q>

<P><HI>Mary Burton further</HI> said, <Q>That she saw VAARCK's <HI>Caesar</HI> pay <HI>John Hughson</HI> Twelve Pounds in Silver Spanish Pieces of Eight, to buy Guns, Swords and Pistols, and that <HI>Hughson</HI> thereupon went up into the Country; and when he returned, he brought with him seven or eight Guns and Swords, and that he hid them in the House; that she had seen a Bag of Shot, and a Barrel of Gunpowder there; that <HI>the Negroes were sworn to burn the Fort first; and then they were to go down to the Fly, and so burn the whole Town;</HI> and the Negroes were to cut their Masters and Mistresies Throats; and when all this done, <HI>Hughson</HI> was to be <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> (VAARCK's) <HI>Governor:</HI> That the Negroes used to say to <HI>Hughson,</HI> when she (the Witness) was in the Room, and heard them talking of burning the Town and Killing the People, that perhaps she (the Witness) would tell; and <HI>Hughson</HI> said, <HI>No, that she dared not;</HI> and the Negroes swore, <HI>that if she did, they would burn, or destroy her.</HI></Q></P>

<P>He said, <Q>That when <HI>John Hughson</HI> lived next Door to him upon the Dock, he kept a very disorderly House, and sold Liquor to, and entertained Negroes there▪ he had often seen many of them there at a Time, at Nights, as well as in the Day Time: Once in Particular he re∣members, in the Evening he saw a great many of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Room, dancing to a Fiddle, and <HI>Hughson's Wife</HI> and <HI>Daughter</HI> along with them.

<P><HI>ADAM KING,</HI> and <HI>GERARDUS COMFORT,</HI> called.</P>
<P><HI>Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> said, <Q>That of late he took <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; for he saw whole Companies of Negroes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laying at Dice there; and that <HI>Winc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p'</HI>s Negro once carried a Silver Spoon there that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down; that he saw no Harm of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> himself.</Q></P>

<P><HI>Court.</HI> Mr. <HI>Comfort,</HI> you are a next door Neighbour to <HI>Hughson;</HI> you live opposite to him, and surely you must have seen Negroes go in and out there often, as the Wit∣nesses have testified, that there were frequent Caballing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Negroes there; pray what have you observed of the House since <HI>Hughson</HI> came to live there?</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="005413_0065_101739ECD26FBA00"/>
<HI>Comfort.</HI> I have seen nothing amiss; I have seen no Harm there.</P>
<P>Court. [to the Prisoners] <HI>Have you any more Witnesses? Hughson.</HI> We have no more, Sir.</P>
<P>Court. <HI>Then now is the Time for you the Prisoners, seve∣rally to offer what you can in your own Defence, that then the Council for the King may sum up the Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Prisoners severally spoke in their Justification in their Turns; protested their Innocence, and declared that all the Witnesses said against them was false; and cal∣led upon God to witness their Asseverations.</P>
<P>Mr. SMITH then proceeded as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>May it please your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury;</HI></P>
<P>YOU have heard the Charge against the Prisoners at the Bar contained in their several Indictments, to which they have each of them pleaded <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> Mr. Attorney has opened the Nature of the Evidence on the Part of the King, and the Witnesses on both Sides have been heard, and I can't think that one among you is in any Doubt concerning what Verdict you ought to give upon the Oath which you have taken.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Scarce any Thing can be conceived more horrid than the Crimes charged on the Prisoners. A Scheme so black and hellish, as <HI>the Burning of this City and the Murdering of the Inhabitants of it!</HI> One would hardly imagine could enter into the Thought, much less be har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed in the Breast of any human Creature; but more wonder∣ful is it, that so great a Number, should unite and con∣spire in so detestable a Piece of Villany: And yet, <HI>Gen∣tlemen,</HI> there seems Nothing wanting to compleat the Evidence that <HI>so barbar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, unjust and cruel a Design</HI> has been set on foot; of which we have had in Part an oc∣cular Demonstration, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> late Fires that have been en∣kindled in diverse Parts of this City; several of which have been lighted up in one Day, to the Amazement and Terror of the People.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Though the Circumstances attending these Fires con∣vinced every body that the Most of them did not proceed from accidental Causes, but from a malicious and wilful Design; yet it was long before any considerable Dis∣covery could be made, of the Authors and Abettors of this most wicked and destructive Undertaking: Yet at length by the Blessing of Heaven, and the uncommon Diligence of the Magistrates, we trust that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the principal Authors of this Mischief, and the Ringleader of it, are now before you.</P></Q>
<P>Upon this Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> proceeded to a distinct Considera∣tion of the Charge, and in observing upon the Evidence of the Witnesses (which was in Substance as before set forth) distinguished the Proofs against each of the Prisoners; which for Brevity sake are here omitted.</P>
<P>And then concluded,</P>
<Q><P>THUS, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> nothing remains to be considered of by you, but the Credit of the Witnesses; against which I can see no reasonable Objection: If they are to be be∣lieved, then the Prisoners <HI>are Guilty;</HI> and you now be∣hold, at this Bar, the Authors, Abettors, and Contrivers of those destructive Fires which your Eyes have seen: Two of the immediate Agents of those Villanies, have already suffered a deserved Punishment, and died con∣fessing their Crimes. The Witnesses declare the prin∣cipal Contriver of those Mischiefs to be that wicked Man <HI>John Hughson,</HI> whose Crimes have made him blacker than a Negro; the Scandal of his Complexion, and the Disgrace of human Nature! Whose Name will descend with Infamy to Posterity! Who could not be content to live by the Gains of an honest Industry; but must be rich at the Expence of the Blood and Ruin of his fellow Citizens! Miserable Wretch! How has he plunged him∣self and Family into that Pit which he has dug for others, and brought down upon his own Pate that violent Deal∣ing which he contrived, and in Part executed against his Neighbours! <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Though the Crimes charged on the Defendants are such as merit a just Indignation; yet in Matters that affect Life, you ought to have the most convincing Evidence: The Trial of the Fact is your Pro∣vince. In Matters of Judgment to condemn the Innocent, and acquit the Guilty, is equally Criminal. If you can, after what you have heard, think the Prisoners innocent, you ought to acquit them; but if you find them guilty, you cannot acquit them without the greatest Injustice and Cruelty to your Country and yourselves. <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I shall add no more, but leave you to the Direction of the Court and your own Consciences.</P></Q>
<P>Then the Third Justice charged the Jury as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS needless for the Court to observe further to you, after what has been said by the Council for the King, concerning the Nature and destructive Tendency of so execrable a Piece of Villany, as this Conspiracy now charged upon the Prisoners at the Bar: It has been
<PB N="59" REF="005413_0066_101739EEE5115970"/>
sufficiently and properly enlarged upon; nor is it any more necessary for the Court to recapitulate the Evidence given in the Case; for that has been very clearly stated, by the Gentlemen at the Bar.</P>
<P>Now,<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> if you cannot credit the several Witnesses for the King, if that can be the Case, you will then acquit the Prisoners of this Charge against them, and find them not Guilty; but on the other Hand, as the Evidence against them seems to be so ample, so full, so clear, and satisfactory, if you have no particular Rea∣sons in your own Breasts, in your own Consciencies, to discredit them; if that, I say, is not the Case,; if you have no Reason to discredit them; then I make no doubt, but you will discharge a good Conscience, and find them Guilty.</P></Q>
<P>A Constable being sworn to attend the Jury, they with∣drew; and being returned in a short Time, found <HI>Hughson, his Wife,</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> GUILTY of all three Indictments; and <HI>Sarah Hughson</HI> the Daughter, GUILTY of the Second and Third.</P>

<Q><P>YOU are now brought before this Court to receive that Sentence which the Law has appointed for your Offences; though I cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay the Punishment is adequate to the horrid Crimes of which you stand con∣victed. The <HI>Roman</HI> Common-Wealth was established some hundred Years before any Law was made against Parricide; they not thinking any Person capable of so atrocious a Crime: Yours are indeed as singular, and unheard of before; they are such as one would scarce believe any Man capable of committing, especially any one who had heard of a God, and of a future State: For People who have been brought up, and always lived in a Christian Country, and also called themselves Chri∣stians, to be guilty not only of making Negro Slaves their Equals, but even their Superiors, by waiting upon, keeping with, and entertaining them, with Meat, Drink, and Lodging; and what is much more amazing, to plot, conspire, consult, abet and encourage these black <HI>Seed of Cain,</HI> to burn this City, and to kill and destroy us all.—GOOD GOD! When I reflect on the Disorders, Confusion, Desolation and Havock, which the Effect of your most wicked, most detestable and diabolical Councils might have produced (had not the Hand of our great and good God interposed) it shocks me! for you, who would have burnt and destroyed without Mercy, ought to be served in a like Manner: And although each of you
<PB N="61" REF="005413_0068_101739F96634B360"/>
have, with an uncommon Assurance, denied the Fact, and audaciously called upon God as a Witness of your Innocence; yet it hath pleased him, out of his unboun∣ded Goodness and Mercy to us, to confound your Devices, and cause your malicious and wicked Machinations and Intentions to be laid open and clear before us, not only to the Satisfaction and Conviction of the Court, the Grand and Petty Jury, but likewise to every one else that has heard the Evidence against you; all are satisfied the just Judgment of God has overtaken you, and that you justly merit a more severe Death than is intended for you, having, in my Opinion, been much worse than the Negroes: However, though your Crimes de∣serve it, yet we must not act contrary to Law.</P>
<P>And now I do most earnestly exhort you, and each of you, to a serious and diligent Improvement of the little Time you have yet to live on this Side of Eternity, duly and heartily to weigh and consider your past wicked and ill-spent Lives, by bewailing, confessing and sincerely repenting of your Sins; that thereby you may obtain Mercy and Forgiveness from our great and just God; for without a sincere, as well as contrite Heart, you can neither expect Mercy or Forgiveness for your manifold Offences, both against God and your Neighbours.</P>
<P>I must now speak particularly <HI>to you John Hughson,</HI> and <HI>to you Sarah Hughson:</HI> Look upon your poor unhappy Daughter, now standing by you, of whom you have been the miserable Instruments of bringing into the World; after that, to train, and bring her up in the School of the Devil, and now lastly, to the Gallows.—I say, consider and set her a good Example, in a Time when every Moment is precious to you, that the great Deceiver of Mankind, may not have the same Power over you all in the next World, as he seems to have had in this,</P>
<P>I must now proceed to the Duty the Law requires of me; which is to tell you,</P>
<P>That you, the Prisoners now at the Bar, be removed to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and there you, and each of you, are to be hanged by the Neck 'til you are severally dead; and I pray God of his great Goodness, to have Mercy on your Souls.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That the said condemned Prisoners be executed on Friday the Twelfth of <HI>June</HI> Instant, between the Hours of Nine and One of the same Day; and that the Body of <HI>John Hughson</HI> be afterwards hung in Chains.</P>

<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>IT will▪ I doubt not, appear to you, upon hearing our Witnesses for the King on this Trial, that these six Negroes are some of the Conspirators who combined with those principal Incendiaries, <HI>Hughson</HI> and his Family, to set on fire the King's House, and this whole Town, and to kill and murder the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>But as I have already, upon the Trial of the Negro <HI>Quack,</HI> for burning the King's House, and of another Negro called <HI>Cuffee,</HI> for burning Mr. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Storehouse, and likewise on the last Trial of <HI>Hughson, his Wife and Daughter,</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> endeavoured to set forth th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Heinousness of so horrible and detestable a Conspiracy; and the Dangers this City and Province may still be exposed to, until Examples are made of all such as have been concerned in this most wicked Plot; I think I have no Need upon this Trial, to say any Thing further on either of these Heads; not doubting but when you have heard the Crimes which these Criminals stand charged with, proved against them, you will find them Guilty.</P></Q>

<P>THE Prisoners being placed at the Bar, were arraigned on an Indictment for conspiring, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with divers Ne∣gro Slaves and others, to burn the whole Town and City of <HI>New-York;</HI> and also to kill and destroy the Inhabitants thereof; whereunto they severally pleaded <HI>Not Guilty; &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Court adjourned to To-morrow Morning 10 o'Clock.</P>
<P>THIS Evening Capt. <HI>Jack</HI> (COMFORT's Negro) con∣demned, amongst others, to be executed To-morrow Afternoon, had caused to be signified to the Judges, that if his Life might be spared, he would discover all that he knew of the Conspiracy: From the Course of the Evi∣dence there was Reason to conclude, that he had been a most trusty and diligent Agent for <HI>Hughson;</HI> he lived very near him; and his Master was frequently absent from home for Days and Weeks together, which left him too much at Liberty; and there was a <HI>Well</HI> in his Yard whereto many Negroes resorted every Day; Morning and Afternoon, to fetch Tea Water: And <HI>Hughson,</HI> no doubt, thought he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad carried a great Point when he had seduced Capt. <HI>Jack</HI> to his infamous Schemes; for this gave him the greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of corrupting his fellow Slaves; and <HI>Jack</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, subtle Fellow, very well qualified for such an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>and might be captivated with the fine Promises and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given him of being not only a Free, but a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Commander in this Band of Fools;</HI> of whom the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> perhaps (like Fools too) <HI>projected to make a Prey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> It was therefore thought p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er, as this Mystery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was yet but beginning to be unfolded, so far to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Jack'</HI>s Offer as to respite his Execution, 'til 'twas so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> well he would deserve further Favour.</P>
<P><HI>Jack</HI> was examined before the Judges this Afternoon; and was under Examination the next Day, when his fellow Criminals were carrying from the City Hall to their Exe∣cution: He was advised not to flatter himself with the Hopes of Life, without he would do the utmost in his Power to deserve it; and that would be by telling freely all that he knew of the Matter, and discovering all the Parties con∣cerned to the best of his Knowledge: He was told we were already let so far into this Secret, as to Persons and Things, as to be able to give a good Guess, whether he spoke the Truth; and he would but deceive himself in the End if he told Falshoods.—<HI>Jack</HI> looked very serious, and at length began to open; but his Dialect was so per∣fectly Negro and unintelligible, 'twas thought, that 'twould be impossible to make any Thing of him without the Help of an Interpreter.—There were two young Men, Sons-in-Law to <HI>Jack'</HI>s Master, who were aware <HI>Jack</HI> would not be understood without their Aid; and they signified their Desire of being by when he was examined, upon a Supposition, that they might be of Ser∣vice in interpreting his Meaning, as he had been used to them, having often worked in the same Shop together at the Cooper's Trade, whereby he was so familiarized to them, they could make a shift to understand his Lan∣guage; and they thought they had such an Influence over him, that they were persuaded, they could also prevail upon him to make an ingenuous Confession; and to do them Justice, they were very serviceable in both Respects; and the Event well answered the Expectation they had given.—But notwithstanding this Assistance, his Examination took up as much Time of three successive Days, Morning and Afternoon, as could conveniently be spared him from other Business.</P>
<P>Several Negroes concerned in the Conspiracy, having been discovered by <HI>Jack</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this first Sitting, were appre∣hended the next Morning early, pursuant to Orders then immediately given; but there was not Time to commit his Confession to Writing this Evening<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 'tis thought proper to set the same forth as of this Day.—<HI>Jack</HI> desired he might be removed from the Cell where his fellow Criminals, condemn'd with him, were lodged, and his Request was granted.</P>

<P>The Attorney General, after opening the Indictment to the Court and Jury, proceeded as follows.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>IT will appear to you by the Evidence for the King upon this Trial, that these four Prisoners at the Bar are some of that great Number of Negroes that frequently met at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House; where he privately entertained them, and where they confederated with him, and the rest of the Conspirators, to carry on this most wicked and dreadful Conspiracy to burn the King's House and this Town, and to murder the Inhabitants.—The most horrible and destructive Plot that ever was yet known in these Northern Parts of <HI>America;</HI> of which <HI>Hughson</HI> was here the chief Contriver and Director, with great Expec∣tations of enriching himself by the Ruin and Destruction of his Neighbours; as has been fully made appear on
<PB N="68" REF="005413_0076_10173A1514F4F1C8"/>
the preceeding Trials; wherefore it may justly be called HUGHSON's PLOT.—It will likewise appear to you in Evidence, that each of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Negro Prisoners were sworn into this direful Conspiracy, and never to discover it, or that <HI>Hughson</HI> was any way concerned in it.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Many of the Conspirators have already been tried, condemned and executed, for the abominable Parts they have acted in this execrable Conspiracy: And <HI>Hugh∣son</HI> himself, his <HI>Wife, Daughter</HI> and <HI>Margaret Kerry,</HI> are under that Sentence of Death which now awaits their Execution, the just Demerits of their heinous Crimes.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>As all the Prisoners at the Bar are Negroes, the Evi∣dence of other Negroes is made sufficient against them by a Law of this Province; which I thought proper to observe to you, because we shall examine several Negro Witnesses to prove what I have alledged against these Negro Prisoners; and when you have heard their Charge proved against them, I can't doubt but you will, for your Oath's Sake, and for your own and this City and Country's Peace and Safety, find the Prisoners Guilty.</P>
<P>We shall now call the Witnesses and examine them before you.</P></Q>

<P N="5">5.

<P>THIS Day <HI>John Hughson, Sarah</HI> his Wife, and <HI>Margaret Kerry,</HI> were executed according to Sentence.</P>
<P>The Under-Sheriff had often advised <HI>John Hughson</HI> to make a Confession about the Conspiracy; but he always denied he knew any Thing of the Matter; said he had deserved Death for receiving stolen Goods. The Wife was ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ullen; said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttle or nothing, but denied all.</P>
<P>The Sheriffs observed <HI>John Hughson,</HI> when he was brought out of Jail to be carried to Execution, to have a red Spot in each Cheek, about the Bigness of a Shilling; which at that Time they thought very remarkable; for he was always pale of Visage: These Spots continued all along to the Gallows: Amongst other Discourse it seems he had said, <HI>he did not doubt but s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me remarkable Sign would happen to him, to shew his Innocence;</HI> concerning w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch more will be observed upon hereafter: He stood up in the Cart all the Way, looking round about him as if expecting to be rescued; as was by many conj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ured from the Air he appeared in: One Hand was lifted up as high as his Pinion would admit of, and a Finger pointing, as if intending to beckon.</P>
<P>At the Gallows his Wife stood like a lifeless Trunk, with the Rope about her Neck tied up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree; she said not a Word, and had scarce any visible Motion.</P>
<P><HI>Peggy</HI> seem'd much less resigned than the other two, or rather unwilling to encounter Death: She was going to say something, but the Old Woman, who hung next to her, gave her a Shove with her Hand, as was said by some, so <HI>Peggy</HI> was silent.</P>
<P>But they <HI>all died, having protested their Innocence to the last,</HI> touching the Conspiracy.</P>
<P>This Old Woman, as it has been generally reported, was bred a Papist; and <HI>Peggy</HI> was much suspected of the same Persuasion,<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Sarah Hughson'<HI>s Confession,</HI> NUMB. II. § 6. 22<HI>d July.</HI></NOTE> tho' <HI>perhaps it may seem</HI> to be of little Significance what Religion such vile Wretches professed.</P>
<P><HI>Peggy</HI> had said several Times, as well after her Conviction as Condemnation for the Conspiracy, as the Judges were informed by the Under-Sheriff, that she had sworn alsly against <HI>John Romme;</HI> which was so gross a Prevarication, as discouraged them from taking any further Pains with her, since there could be no D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pendance upon what she should say: The Evening before her Execution she sent a Message to Mr. Justice <HI>Philipse▪</HI> signifying her Desire to speak with him; he accordingly went to her; she declared to him, that she had forsworn herself; for that all she had said about <HI>Romme and his Wife</HI> was false, excepting as to their receiving the stolen Goods of the Negroes.—From the scanty Room in the Jail for the Reception of so many Prisoners, this miserable Wretch, upon her Conviction with the <HI>Hughsons</HI> for the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>piracy, was put into the same Cell with them; which perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was an unfortunate Incident; for though she had to the Time of their Trial screened them from the Charge of the Conspiracy; yet there was Reason to expect, that upon the last Pinch, when she found there was no Hopes of saving her own Life if she persisted, the Truth as to this Particular would have come out: And indeed it was upon this Expectation that she was brought upon Trial for the Conspiracy; for her
<PB N="73" REF="005413_0081_10173A25C5FDFB38"/>
several Examinations before set forth, and what <HI>Arthur Price</HI> had sworn to have dropt from her in accidental Talk in the Jail, had put it beyond Doubt, that she was privy to many of the <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Secrets concerning this detestable Confederacy; but when she was admitted to the <HI>Hughsons,</HI> under the Circumstances of Conviction and Condemnation for the Conspiracy, they most probably prevailed with her to persevere in her Obstinancy, to the End to cover their own Guilt, since they were determined to confess Nothing themselves; and they might drive her to Desperation by subtle Insinuations, that the Judges she saw after they had pick'd all they could out of her, whatever Expectations she might have raised from her Confessions, or Hopes she flat∣ter'd herself with of saving her Life upon the Merit of them, yet after all, she was brought to Trial and condemned for the Conspiracy, as well as they; and why should she expect Pardon any more than they: And by such like Artifices 'tis probable they might stop her Mouth, and prevent her making further Discovery; and not only so, but then of Course prevail with her to recant, as to what she had confessed already.</P>
<P><HI>John Hughson'</HI>s Body was hung in Chains according to Sentence.</P>
<P>This Day also, <HI>Albany, Curacoa Dick</HI> and <HI>Francis,</HI> Ne∣groes, were executed according to Sentence,</P>

<P>The Attorney General having opened the Indictment proceeded as follows.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL shew you, by the Witnesses for the King upon the Trial of these five Negroes, that they, with many others, frequently met at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House, where they entered into a Confederacy with <HI>and were sworn by him, to carry on this most wicked and villainous Plot, and not to discover it, or that</HI> Hughson <HI>had any Hand in it▪</HI> and that they agreed to bring all their Booty to him, to enrich him and make him great.—<HI>Thus</HI> were these <HI>stupid Wretches</HI> seduced by the Instigation of the Devil, and <HI>Hughson</HI> his Agent, to undertake so senseless, as well as wicked an Enterprize; which must inevitably end in their own Destruction, as now too late they find▪ and that in the Snares they laid for us, they themselves are taken.—<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> It cannot be imagined that these silly unthinking Creatures <HI>(Hughson's black Guard)</HI> could of themselves have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and carried on so deep, so direful and destructive a Scheme, as that we have seen with our Eyes, and have heard fully proved they had prepared for us, without the Advice and Assi∣stance of such abandoned Wretches as <HI>Hughson</HI> was.—That never-to-be forgotten <HI>Hughson,</HI> who is now gone to his Place, as did <HI>Judas</HI> of old to his.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="005413_0082_10173A27D32C2848"/>
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>These Negro Prisoners being drawn into this abomina∣ble Conspiracy by others, does not give them the least Umbrage of Excuse; they are equally as guilty as if they themselves had devised it, by consenting to it, <HI>taking Oaths to proceed in it,</HI> and in the mean Time <HI>to keep it secret.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>The Number of the Conspirators is very great; for besides these five Negroes, Fourteen others, and four white People, which I have been concerned in the several Trials of▪ have already been convicted, and received Sentence of Death; and we have still daily new Disco∣veries of many more; but have now, God be thanked, Encouragement to hope, that we shall soon reach to the Bottom of this Mystery of Iniquity.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Be pleased to observe, That all the Prisoners now to be tried, being Negroes, the Evidence of one Negro against another, is, by a Law of this Province made sufficient; which I thought necessary to put you in mind of, because several Negro Witnesses will be examined against these five Negro Prisoners: And when you have heard their Charge clearly proved against them; I doubt not but you will, for your own Sakes, your Oath's Sake, and for the future Peace and Security of this City and Province, find th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Negroes guilty.</P></Q>

She did not remember that she had seen <HI>Fortune</HI> at those Meetings; but thought she knew his Face.</P>
<P><HI>Jack</HI> (COMFORT'S) said, he saw <HI>Capt. Ben, Quash,</HI> and <HI>Cato</HI> (PROVOOST's) at the Meeting of the Conspirators at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s on the Sunday; and that there they talked of burning the Town and killing the white People, and that they were consenting and as forward and busy as the rest.

<P><HI>Sandy</HI> said, That he saw <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Cato</HI> (COWLEY's) at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s, at the great Meeting there about a Fortnight before the Fort burnt; and that <HI>they</HI> agreed amongst the rest, <HI>to burn the Town, and kill the white People.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bastian</HI> confirmed <HI>Mary Burton'</HI>s Evidence, and likewise <HI>Jack</HI> (Comfort's) That <HI>Ben, Cato</HI> (Cowley's) and <HI>Quash,</HI> and also <HI>Fortune,</HI> were at the great Meeting on a Sunday at Hughson's, <HI>when they were talking of burning the Town, and killing the People.</HI> And further, <HI>That they were all sworn to do it, and to keep secret.</HI> That he likewise saw <HI>Ben, Cato</HI> (Cowley's) and <HI>Quash</HI> at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s on a Sunday about a Fortnight before the Fort burnt, and the Talk was the same amongst them there, and they all consented. He said <HI>there were two Rooms full of Negroes there, the Kitchen and the Shop,</HI> as he was told, but he was only in the Kitchen.</P>
<P><HI>Will,</HI> alias <HI>Tickle</HI> or <HI>Ticklepitcher,</HI> said he was at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s at the great Meeting about a Fortnight before the Fort burnt, and he there saw <HI>Fortune, Ben</HI> and <HI>Cato</HI> (Cowley's) and spoke as to what passed there, as the foregoing Wit∣nesses <HI>Jack, Sandy</HI> and <HI>Bastian.</HI> And further that <HI>Cato</HI> (Cowley's) <HI>went to the Pump to wash his Hands, and</HI> Fortune <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umped the Water for him.</HI></P>

<P>THE Criminals being placed at the Bar, were asked, what they had to say, why Sentence of Death should not be pronounced against them; they offered nothing, but Protestations of their Innocence.</P>
<P>Then the Third Justice proceeded as followeth.</P>
<Q><P>YOU, the Criminals at the Bar, hearken to what is now to be said to you.</P>
<P>You <HI>Ben,</HI> by the Course of the Evidence appear to have been a principal Ringleader in this most horrid and devilish Conspiracy, this Mast-piece of Villainy.</P>
<P>You, no doubt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>steemed amongst these infernal Confederates, a deep P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>cian; and was therefore fixt upon to be an Officer, nothing less than a Captain, a Commander of an Hundred at least.</P>
<P>And so exact a Man were you in your Business and Trust, that, it seems, <HI>you kept a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist:</HI> You say you can∣not read; but so active and forward have you appeared in this Villany, that a List of this black Band was com∣mitted to your Care, as appeared in Evidence: And you gave sufficient Reasons for ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning entire Credit with them; for you insinuated yourself into their Opinions, by shewing them how useful a Person you could be to them, from your Master's great Indulgence and entire Confidence in you: <HI>You could go into any Room in his House; you knew were his Gun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Arms were, and could come at them; a considerable Number, no less than Thirty where stored in a Room in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Outhouse: You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id, and used your Master's Horse oftener than he did him∣self,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you said upon your Trial; and therefore could, no doubt, the sooner mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er your Company, visit your Confederate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and make Dispatch: These were some Particulars of your Merits to recommend you to these Assa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ins, these Murderers.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="005413_0085_10173A341255A250"/>
Thou v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Wretch! How much does thy Ingratitude enhance your Guilt! And your hypocritical, canting Behaviour upon your Trial, your Protestations of Inno∣cence, your Dissimulation before God and Man, will be no small Article against you at the Day of Judgment; for ye have all Souls to be saved or to be damned; your Spirits are immortal, that is to say, They will live for∣ever, to be either eternally happy or eternally miserable in the other World: And <HI>be not deceived, God will not be mocked;</HI> he will not be baffled withal; he knows all your Thoughts, and sees all your Actions, and will reward every one according to their Works; those that have done good shall go into everlasting Rest and Hap∣piness; that is to say, into Life eternal; and they that have done evil, and dye hardy and impenient, shall be thrown into the infernal Lake of Fire and Brimstone, together with the Devil and his accursed Spirits, where the Worm never dyeth; that is, the biting, gnawing Worm of Conscience will forever be upbraiding you, and the Fire will never be quenched; but in this Torment you must remain under the most bitter Weeping, Wailing, and Gnashing of Teeth, Time without End.</P>
<P>If you would not have this your Portion, then let us tell you and admonish you, in Compassion to your wretched miserable Souls, immediately to confess your Guilt, your horrid Sins, before God and Man, and discover your Accomplices, that you may prevent all further Mischief, which may otherwise happen from this your hellish Con∣spiracy; sincerely and heartily bewail your heinous and crying Sins, and entreat Forgiveness of God Almighty; for upon these Considerations only, can you entertain any rational or well grounded Hope of being received into the Arms of his Mercy.</P>
<P>And now, What is the End of all these your most wicked, detestable, and horrible Devices? Why, you have suc∣ceeded so far as to put Part of your accursed Scheme in Execution; You have burnt down and consumed the King's House and Buildings in the Fort; the House of <HI>Van Zant,</HI> and have made Attempts to burn several others, which God Almighty in Mercy and his won∣derful and gracious good Providence, has prevented, by suffering the Flames to be timely extinguished; the Villanies of these diabolical Confederates have been de∣tected; many of them have already met with their De∣serts, and are gone to their long Homes, whither you are in a few Hours to follow them; for you are now also delivered into the Hands of our Laws, and in this World you must have Justice, and you are left to the Mercy of God in the next.</P>
<P>What has already been said, is applicable, most of it, to every one of you.</P>
<P>And, in as particular a Manner, <HI>Quash,</HI> may you be upbraided with the like Reproaches for your Ingra∣titude; for as we have been informed, you have likewise had a very indulgent Master, who has put great Trust and Confidence in you; it may be presumed, from your having better Sense than the rest of his Negroes; how vilely then have you abused his Indulgence! In return for Kindnesses, you Wretches, would imbrue your Hands in the Blood of your Masters, and their Families; you that would destroy without Mercy, with what Face can you expect Mercy at the Hands of God, unless you acknow∣ledge every one his Guilt, and bewail it with hearty Sorrow, and sincere Tears of Repentance; and beseech his Forgiveness; laying open the whole wicked Scheme, and discovering your several Confederates and Accom∣plices, all the Parties concerned; so that an effectual Stop may be put to all further Mischief: Upon these Con∣ditions only can you expect Mercy at the Hands of God Almighty.</P>
<P>As to you two <HI>Catoes,</HI> and you <HI>Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>You appear, indeed, to have been inferior Agents; but your Hearts as corrupt and ripe for Mischief as any of the Rest; You have all alike taken, <HI>that hellish, execrable Oath,</HI> and equally bound yourselves in that villainous Engagement; not only to burn and consume your Master's Substance; but to murder and destroy their Persons and Families; you were as willing and ready as the Ablest of them to act your Parts in this bloody Scheme.</P>
<P>It is a very irksome Task to pronounce that Sentence which the Law requires of us; for we delight not in any Man's Blood; but the Law adjudges you unfit to live.</P>
<P>Therefore the Sentence against you, is</P>
<P>That you, each and every of you, be carried from hence to the Place from whence you came, from thence to the Place of Execution, where you <HI>Ben,</HI> and you <HI>Quash,</HI> are to be each of you chained to a Stake, and burnt to Death.</P>
<P>And you <HI>Cato</HI> (Mr. PROVOOST's) you <HI>Cato</HI> (Mr. COWLEY's) and you <HI>Fortune,</HI> are each and every of you to be hanged by the Neck until you be severally dead.</P>
<P>And the Lord, of his infinite Mercy, have Compassion upon your poor wretched Souls.</P></Q>

<HI>Ordered,</HI> That the Execution of <HI>Cato</HI> (COWLEY's) <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Cato</HI> alias <HI>Toby,</HI> be on the Morrow the 16th Instant, between the Hours of Nine and One of the same Day; And</P>

<P>THIS being the Day appointed for the Trial of these Prisoners as Slaves upon an Indictment for the Con∣spiracy, on which they were arraigned on Saturday last, they were brought to the Bar in order to proceed thereon: But they complained (as 'tis supposed, they were advised) that they had great Injustice done them by being sold here as Slaves; for that, as they pretended, they were Free∣men in their own Country, and gave in their several Sir-names.</P>
<P>The Indictment was grounded upon an Act of Assembly<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">4<HI>th</HI> GEO. II. <HI>For the more effectual preventing and punishing the Conspiracy and Insurrection of Negro and other Slaves,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>before mentioned on Trial of</HI> Quack <HI>and</HI> Cuffee, 29<HI>th May.</HI></NOTE> which enumerated several Offences; and Conspiracies amongst the rest; and made one Slave Evidence against another; so that this Fetch might probably be calculated to take off the Negro Evidence: The Prisoners all protested they could not speak English; <HI>and as</HI> Mary Burton <HI>was the only white Evidence against them,</HI> and should it be credited that they could speak only in a Tongue which she did not understand, how could she tell what passed between them in Conversation at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s? Thus their Advisers might think they would stand the best Chance for the Jury to acquit them.</P>
<P>The Court deferred their Trial till Wednesday the 17th Instant.</P>

<P><HI>Tickle Pitcher</HI> said, <Q>That about three Weeks after New-Year he saw all the Prisoners at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s on a Sunday Evening with one <HI>Spanish</HI> Negro more; and Mr. <HI>De Lancey's</HI> Negro [<HI>Antonio] had something black, which he said was to throw on Houses to set them on fire; and he cut it in Pieces, and gave to several of the Negroes.</HI> That he [the Witness] did not then stay at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, so did not hear what they talked of.—That afterwards there was a great Meeting of the Negroes at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s, and he saw <HI>Juan</HI> and <HI>Augustine</HI> there; <HI>and it was agreed by those present to set the Town on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and kill the white People; and there they sharpened their Knives.</HI>—That <HI>Mr.</HI> Niblet'<HI>s Sawney</HI> was also there, and Burk'<HI>s Sarah,</HI> who told him, that they were making a Plot to kill the White People, burn the Houses, and to steal the Money and Goods, and go off▪ <HI>There were two Rooms full of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, some were in the Kitchen and some in the Shop.</HI></Q></P>

The Prisoners upon their Defence denied all in general that was alledged against them, and made great Protesta∣tions of their Innocence; and most of them <HI>pretended to have been sick or lame,</HI> so that they were incapable of going abroad from New-Year to the Time of the Fire at the Fort, [the Eighteenth of <HI>March</HI>] neither could they speak English.</P>
<P><HI>Antonio,</HI> (De Lancey's) said in particular.

<P>Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> summed up against <HI>Augustine</HI> and <HI>Juan.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Court charged the Jury as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>THE Prisoners at the Bar stand charged upon two several Indictments, for conspiring to burn and de∣stroy this City, and murder the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The one Indictment is grounded upon an Act of Assembly of this Province, supposing them to be Slaves, by which Act the Testimony of one Negro Slave shall be legal Evidence against another.</P>
<P>But it has been made a Question, whether these Pri∣soners, now before us, are Slaves or not; and the Priso∣ners themselves pretend to be free Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> with whom we are now at War, from whom they have been taken, and made Prize, and have been condemned, and adjudged as such in the Court of Admi∣ralty here, without any Plea being offered there, or so much as any Claim or Pretence of the Prisoners being entitled to any Privilege, as being free Subjects of <HI>Spain;</HI> and surely, there never could have been a more proper Time and Season for them to have set up such Pretence, as when their Case was depending before the Court of Admiralty, where they should have offered it by Way of Plea; especially considering, that by their Neglect of that Opportunity, they must well know the Consequence would be their being adjudged as Part of the Goods and Chattels of the Subjects of <HI>Spain,</HI> would be condemned as lawful Prize, and would also be sold as Slaves; but if this Pretence had been offered there, (as it was not) and they could not have proved the Truth of the Plea, it would not have availed them; but they must have been adjudged to be Slaves.</P>
<P>But they have made that Pretence in this Court; and what has been offered in Support of it? Why, there has been several Witnesses that have spoke to the Point; and what is the Amount of their Testimony? Why, it is no more than the Hearsay of an Hearsay of a Per∣son, who imagined or believed, that they, or most of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Negroes taken by Capt. <HI>Lush</HI> were Freemen; but which of them were, or were not, he could not say; nor does it appear, that the Prisoners at the Bar, or any of them, are such of Capt. <HI>Lush'</HI>s Prize-Prisoners, as that the said <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentleman imagined were Free; for it was no more than his Imagination, as to any of them being such.</P>
<P>You have heard the Adjudication and Decree of the Court of Admiralty read, by which it appears, they were condemned as Prize; and that they were sold as Slaves, has been proved by the Vendue-Master; therefore for what appears now before the Court, it should seem, that they realy are Slaves: And as nothing appears; no sufficient or proper Evidence appears to the Contrary; then if you take them upon these Considerations, to be Slaves; all the Negro Evidence which has been given upon this Trial against them, is legal Evidence; and so you are to consider of that Testimony, and let it have its full Force; and if you should have sufficient Reasons in your own Consciences to discredit them, and that not∣withstanding the Weight of that Evidence, you can think them, or any of them, not guilty, you will then say so, and acquit them, or such of them as you think Innocent as to the Charge of this Indictment, upon the Act of Assembly.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="005413_0091_10170FE30188B340"/>
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>The Prisoners having started this Pretence, of being free Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in case it should have happened upon this Trial, as we think it has not, that there should be sufficient Evidence to shew that the Prisoners were Freemen; if we could take them to be such; is it fit, that Persons guilty of so atrocious and enormous Crimes (let them be free or bond) such execrable Villains should miss of their deserved Punish∣ments and escape the Justice of the Law? Surely, that would be very unbecoming, that such Wickedness should be suffered with Impunity in any well regulated Government or Society: Therefore, be they Freemen, or be they Slaves, the main Question before you is, whe∣ther they, or any, or which of them are guilty of the Charge against them, in the second Indictment, of con∣spiring with other Slaves and Persons to burn the House in the Fort, to burn the Town, and murder and destroy the People.</P>
<P>To prove the Charge in this Indictment, there was the Testimony of <HI>Mary Burton;</HI> I must observe to you, that her Testimony, as to the Charge in this Indictment, is single; there is no other Witness; but nevertheless, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> one Witness is sufficient; and if you give Credit to her Testimony, you will, no doubt, discharge a good Conscience, and find them Guilty; If you should have sufficient Reason in your own Minds to discredit her Testimony, if you can think so, you must then acquit them: The Prisoners seem all to be equally involved, by her Testimony, in this unparalelled and hellish Con∣spiracy, and there is no Room to make any Difference between them; therefore, you will either acquit them all, or find them all Guilty.</P></Q>
<P>Then the Jury withdrew, and in about half an Hour, returned, and found them all GUILTY.</P>

<HEAD>The Confession of Tom, Ben. Moore's Negro, Before the Grand Jury.</HEAD>
<P><HI>He said,</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. THAT <HI>Cuffee,</HI> Philipse's; was the first Man that engaged him in the Conspiracy; that he went with him to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, where he treated him with Punch; that this was about the Beginning of the Win∣ter, when the cold Weather was coming in, on a Sa∣turday, and the first Time of his being at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House; at which Time nothing was said or done re∣markable.</P>
<P N="2">2. That about a Week after he went there again on a Sunday, with the said <HI>Cuffee, Prince,</HI> Auboyneau's; and <HI>Caesar,</HI> Vaarck's; That soon after they got to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, <HI>Caesar and Cuffee</HI> went out of the House, and <HI>Prince</HI> asked him (<HI>Tom</HI>) if he would be concerned with them in what they were going about to do? On which he asked, what that was? To which <HI>Prince</HI> replied, that he should know it when <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Cuffee</HI> returned.</P>
<P N="3">3. That soon after <HI>Cuffee</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> came in, and then the same Question was asked him again; to which he answered as before, by asking of them what they were going about? <HI>Cuffee</HI> then replied, That <HI>they were going to burn Houses; that he</HI> (Cuffee) <HI>would burn his Master's House,</HI> where there was Money enough; that he (<HI>Tom</HI>) should have a Share of it.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="84" REF="005413_0092_10173A4F1552B998"/>
4. That he refused to be concerned with them, saying, That he durst not do it; for the White People would play the Devil with them; but <HI>Cuffee</HI> answered, that he needed not to fear that, for that he had got <HI>People enough to stand by them;</HI> and then he <HI>(Tom)</HI> told them, he would consider on it; and then they broke up: This being the second Meeting at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s; at which, neither <HI>Hughson,</HI> nor any other Person was present.</P>
<P N="5">5. That about four or five Days after, he met <HI>Caesar</HI> in the Street, who told him, that if he would go down yonder (meaning to <HI>Hughson's</HI>) he would come to him; that he went down, and soon after <HI>Caesar</HI> came to him, and called for some Punch; that when they had drank, <HI>Caesar</HI> asked him, if he would be concerned with them in what they were going to do; that he answered, he would not, for he did not like it: <HI>Caesar</HI> took the Punch, and drank to him again; and when that Tankard was out, he called for another, and drank to him again; and then asked him, why he refused to be concerned with them; telling him, that at their last Meeting, he said he would consider of it; on which he <HI>(Tom)</HI> being heated with Liquor, said, he would join with them; and then <HI>Hughson</HI> was called on, <HI>who came with a Book, and swore him; the Purport of the Oath being to be secret, and true to one another.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. That the next Day after, he went again to <HI>Hugh∣son'</HI>s, in the Evening by himself; but finding none of the Rest there, he returned speedily; and to the best of his Remembrance, this was the last time that he went there.</P>
<P N="7">7. That some Days after he met <HI>Cuffee</HI> in the Street, who asked him when he would go down again to <HI>Hugh∣son'</HI>s? that he answered him, he would go there no more; that he was sorry for what he had done; for what they were going about was a very great Sin; that <HI>Cuffee</HI> then called him a Fool, and told him, <HI>that if he thought it a wrong Thing, or a Sin, there was a Man that he knew, that could forgive him:</HI> That while they were speaking, <HI>Caesar</HI> came to them, and then <HI>Cuffee</HI> told him, that he <HI>(Tom)</HI> was going to leave them; on which <HI>Caesar</HI> cursed him, and said if he did, or spoke a Word of what had passed among them, he had a Pocket Pistol, and would be the Death of him; but <HI>Caesar</HI> as well as <HI>Cuffee</HI> told him, <HI>that if he was in any Pain about what they were going to do, as a Sin, there was</HI> AN OLD MAN <HI>in Town, who they know, that could forgive them.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. That some time after, <HI>Caesar</HI> came to him on <HI>Bayard'</HI>s Wharff, and threatned to throw him into the River, if he fell off from them, or informed any body what they were going to do; that he <HI>(Tom)</HI> was afraid, and told him, that he would be true to them; and so they parted; and that ever after he shunn'd them, and never was at any Time in Company with them, neither at publick or private Meetings.</P>
<P N="9">9. That one Sunday he had a Mind to disclose this Design and Conspiracy to Mr. <HI>Ogilvie,</HI> and went to him for that Purpose; that he told him, that he had some∣thing to tell him, which was a very great Sin, and would surprize him; but <HI>Ogilvie</HI> answered, that he was going to Church, and bid him come when the Church was out, and he would hear him: That he did not go to Mr. <HI>Ogilvie</HI> after Church was out, nor did he ever after say any Thing to him about it.</P></Q>

<P><HI>Bastian</HI> said, He saw <HI>York</HI> and <HI>London</HI> at the two great Meetings at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s and <HI>Comfort'</HI>s, each on a Sun∣day; and that the Negroes all present agreed <HI>to burn their Master's Houses, and to kill the People;</HI> to burn the Fort first, then to fire by Mr. <HI>De Lancey'</HI>s.—Ben <HI>swore them all.</HI>—That by Direction of <HI>Caesar,</HI> (hanged) <HI>Hughson put the Witness's Name down in a Paper,</HI> as a Person engaged in the Conspiracy; <HI>Caesar</HI> said, he [the Witness] was a faint-hearted Dog, but he would spirit him up: That <HI>London</HI> said, his Master would trust him in his House more than <HI>York,</HI> and he could easier get into any Room, and murder him.—That both <HI>York</HI> and <HI>London</HI> ground their Knives at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s; one had a Knife of his own, the other took one of <HI>Jack'</HI>s: That he saw <HI>Cato</HI> and <HI>Harry</HI> at the great Meeting at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, where 'twas agreed, that the Negroes were to get their Master's Arms, <HI>to burn their Houses, and to murder them.</HI>—That this Meeting was three or four Weeks before the Fort was burnt, the Meet∣ing at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s; was the Sunday after.—That he saw only <HI>Harry</HI> at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s; he took a Knife of <HI>Jack;</HI> the Negroes all whetted their Knives, and some said they were sharp enough to cut the white Men's Heads off.—This Witness gave an Account of the Treatment of <HI>Sandy</HI> at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s, that upon <HI>Sandy'</HI>s denying <HI>Jack</HI> to be concerned in the Plot, and telling him, that if they wanted to fight, they might go and fight with the Spaniards, and not with their own Master's and Mistresses; that thereupon <HI>Sarah</HI> (Burk's Negro Wench) told <HI>Sandy</HI> he was <HI>very impudent to talk so to Capt. Jack,</HI> and that he deserved to have his Head cut off.</P>
<P><HI>Tickle,</HI> a Negro, said, He was at the great Meeting at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s on a Sunday; that <HI>Hughson</HI> said to the Negroes, <HI>Now there was so many met together, it was a good Time to make a Plot;</HI> and he proposed to them, that they should set fire to the Houses, steal as many Goods as they could and bring them to him, and as the People came out of their Houses they were to kill them; so to fire the Houses all around the Town. That he saw <HI>Harry</HI> at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, and he agreed to set his Mistress's House on fire, and to kill the People.

<P><HI>Jane Lovell</HI> said, That the Day Mr. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Store-house was on fire, <HI>Mink</HI> (Groesbeck's Negro) was coming from his Master's Rope-Walk with a Coil of Ropes, and he and the Prisoner <HI>Cato</HI> stopp'd by her House; and she said to them, that all this Trouble was occasioned by them; to which <HI>Mink</HI> answered, he wished all concerned were tied to a Stake and burnt; whereto <HI>Cato</HI> replied, <HI>he was a Fool, if he knew as much as he did, he would hold his Tongue.</HI></P>

<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>THAT about fourteen Days before <HI>Quack,</HI> Roosevelt's, came to Prison, he and Hermanus Rutgers's <HI>Quash</HI> were in the Wood-Yard, and called a Negro Man (of a Sunday Morning) in, belonging to Mr. <HI>Leffert,</HI> named <HI>Pompey;</HI> they asked him, <HI>if he would do as they would do?</HI> He answered, <HI>What's that?</HI> If <HI>you'll do as we will, we'll tell you:</HI>—He would.</P>
<P><HI>Quash</HI> proposed, if he <HI>(Pompey)</HI> would set his Master's House on fire, that he <HI>(Quash)</HI> would set his Master's House on fire; and <HI>Quack</HI> was to set his Master Mr. <HI>Roosevelt'</HI>s House on fire, likewise Mr. <HI>Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derheul'</HI>s House.—<HI>Pompey</HI> said, <HI>they might do as they would; if they did it he would not tell;</HI> and likewise said, <HI>he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, his Master's House on fire.</HI>—They <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Quash</HI> promised him <HI>(Pompey)</HI> if he would do as he had promised; that is, to set fire to his Master's House; they would assist him to escape, and be the Means of making him free.</P></Q>

<HEAD>DEPOSITION of MARY BURTON, Taken before one of the Judges.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">NUMB. IV</HEAD>
<P><HI>MARY BURTON</HI> being duly Sworn, deposed,</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. That the Person Yesterday shewn to her in Prison, lately taken into Custody on Suspicion of being a <HI>Roman Catholick Priest,</HI> is the same Person she has often seen at the House of <HI>John Hughson:</HI> That to the best of her Remembrance she saw him there first, some time about Christmass last; and that then for a Fortnight together he used to come there almost every Night, and sometimes used to lie there, but was always gone in the Morning before she the Deponent got up; but she well remembers he used to go by different Names, but whether by the Name of <HI>JURY</HI> or <HI>URY,</HI> or <HI>DOYLE,</HI> she cannot now depose positively; but to the best of her Remem∣brance, some of his Names consisted only of one Syllable, and believes she has heard him called by all the said three Names.</P>
<P N="2">2. That after the said Fortnight, she believes the said Person did not come to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s for about a Week; that then he used to come again frequently almost every Night, until the Time of the Stealing of <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Goods: He used to strip himself and go to Bed, as if he was to lie there all Night; but was always gone in the Morning when this Deponent got out of Bed.</P>
<P N="3">3. That when he came to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, he always went up Stairs in the Company of <HI>Hughson, his Wife and Daughter, and Peggy,</HI> with whom the Negroes used to be at the same Time consulting about the Plot; and that she has often heard Hughson, <HI>the rest of the white People, and the Negroes, talk in the Presence of the said</HI> Jury, <HI>about setting fire to the Houses, and killing the white People of this City;</HI> and has often, when such Conversation was going on, seen the said <HI>Jury,</HI> alias <HI>Ury,</HI> whispering to <HI>Hughson, his Wife, &amp;c. and the Negroes,</HI> which she understood to be joining in the Conspiracy with them; she thought it looked very like it; tho' she cannot say she ever heard him speak out; but said, she esteemed his Actions and Behaviour to signify his Approbation and Consent to what was carrying on by the Company, touching this Conspiracy; and this not one Time in particular, but a great many.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Conspirators before mentioned generally went into a Room above Stairs to hold their Consulta∣tions, and the Deponent (being a Servant in the House) used often to go into that Room to carry such Things as they wanted; and often came in upon them at such Seasons, when (as she believes) they would rather have excused her Appearance; for she has observed, that her coming in has sometimes made <HI>Jury</HI> uneasy; that they used generally to call up <HI>Mary Hughson</HI> the Daughter, to bring what they wanted; but when she was out of the Way, the Deponent used to go up: She believes
<PB N="96" REF="005413_0104_10173A6961D5A2E8"/>
the said <HI>Mary</HI> was likewise in their Secrets: <HI>Never heard her say any Thing of the Plot,</HI> but has heard the rest talk of it often before her the said <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That <HI>Hughson, his Wife, Daughter Sarah, and Peggy, and the said Ury,</HI> when this Deponent has come into the Room amongst them to bring what they wanted, have several Times turned out all the Negroes present, and then have <HI>all joined in tempting this Deponent to take an Oath;</HI> but upon her asking them for what? they would not tell her; but said, <HI>she must swear first, and then they would tell her;</HI> but this she absolutely denied over and over; at which Refusal they were angry, and turned her out of the Room; and <HI>Ury</HI> said to her, <HI>had not you better swear and go fine, than go as she did;</HI> for they <HI>all</HI> (the Hughsons, Peggy <HI>and</HI> Jury, <HI>had when they proposed to her to swear</HI>) offered her Silks, and a deal of fine Things, if she would comply with their Requests; and <HI>Peggy</HI> said she was a great Fool if she did not.</P>
<P N="6">6. That about a Fortnight or three Weeks before <HI>Hogg's</HI> Goods were stolen, she has observed <HI>Campbell</HI> (with whom she has heard <HI>Jury</HI> used to keep School) come to <HI>Hughson's</HI> of a Sunday, sometimes one <HI>Garr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Van Emborough</HI> with him; and that <HI>Campbell</HI> used to go into the Room below with the <HI>Hughsons, Peggy,</HI> and <HI>Caesar, Prince</HI> and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> (Negroes) and when these were met, the <HI>Hughsons</HI> used to turn the Deponent up Stairs: But she can't say she ever heard them talking of the Plot before <HI>Campbell,</HI> but she strongly suspected that he knew of it, from his keeping Company with the <HI>Hughsons, and the said three Negroes,</HI> whom she looked upon to be the principal Heads of the Negroes in the Conspiracy.</P>
<P N="7">7. That during the Time there was Snow upon the Ground, all last Winter, she has often known <HI>Hughson</HI> to go out of Town a-Days, upon the Pretence of fetch∣ing Firewood from the Commons, with his Sleigh; and that he has not returned Home 'til Eight, Nine, Ten or Eleven o'Clock at Night, at different Times, and has brought Negroes to Town to his House; and that he has carried them back again in his Sleigh after Midnight, One, Two or Three o'Clock, and has not returned Home again sometimes till Seven or Eight o'Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P N="8">8. That she has several Times seen Mr. <HI>Peter De Lancey'</HI>s Spanish Negro <HI>Antonio</HI> at <HI>Hughson's,</HI> when he <HI>(Hughson)</HI> has come Home late out of the Wood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and that she has seen him many Times get into <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Sleigh late in the Night; and that <HI>Hughson</HI> has not returned Home '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il Six, Seven or Eight the next Morning: But at that Time this Deponent did not know where the said Spanish Negro lived, whether in Town or Country.</P>
<P N="9">9. That one Day at <HI>Hughson's,</HI> some of the Negroes had behaved rudely towards her, and being in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she was provoked to swear at them in the Presence of <HI>Jury,</HI> alias <HI>Ury,</HI> above mentioned, and upon recollecting herself she said, <HI>God forgive me:</HI> whereupon the said <HI>Ury</HI> answered her, <HI>That was a small Matter; be could forgive her a great deal more Sins than that; that was Nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. That at another Time when the Negroes had provoked her, she wished those black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oads at the Devil; <HI>Oh,</HI> says Jury, <HI>let them be black, or what they will, the Devil has nothing to do with them; I can forgive them their Sins, and you yours too.</HI></P></Q>

<P N="3">3.

<P N="2">2. That the next Sunday Morning he went again, and met with the same Company; that they again called for Rum, which <HI>Hughson</HI> brought; that he sat down in Company with them; and after they had drank their Liquor, <HI>Hughson</HI> asked the other two, whether he <HI>(Tom)</HI> would join with them? The Prisoner asked <HI>for what?</HI> Quash said, <HI>to rise and burn down the Town, and kill the white People;</HI> that Quack said, <HI>I my self intend to have the Fort down before long:</HI> That they put a Book upon his Breast and forced him to swear; that <HI>Hughson</HI> told him <HI>he must wish the Thunder to strike him down if he ever discovered it;</HI> that he repeated <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Words and kissed the Book.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>Hughson</HI> asked the Prisoner, Whether his Master had Guns, Swords or Cutlasses? he answered No, but that his Master had Sword Blades; but said, that he never carried any there.</P>

<P N="5">5. That <HI>Hughson</HI> told him <HI>he must do this when he saw a great many Houses on fire in the Night, and great Hurry and Noise of the People, that he should come out and join with the rest:</HI> That he must get a Knife; to which he answered, he would get a Sword Blade which would do better; that <HI>Hughson</HI> told him, if he would come in the Afternoon, he might see a great Number of Negroes who were concerned.—Said, that he could no go out in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>That he went a third Time of a Sunday Morning with the same Company as before; and that they again drank Rum, and had much the same Discourse as the former; <HI>that</HI> Hughson <HI>was very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnest in the Affair.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3.

<P N="6">6.

<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="2">2. That the Company broke up about eight o'Clock, and as they were all going out of the Gate, Hughson <HI>stopped him and asked him if he would join with him, and the Negroes in what they were going about? Adam</HI> asked <HI>Hughson</HI> what that was? Hughson said <HI>they were going to set fire to the Houses of the Town, and to kill the white People:</HI> He answered <HI>that he would be concerned with them:</HI> Then <HI>Hughson</HI> asked him to come to his House, and talk further upon it.</P>
<P N="3">3. That accordingly he went to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House two or three Days afterwards, and drank a Bowl of Punch with him there; <HI>Hughson</HI> having carried him up Stairs; over their Liquor the Conversation ran upon the intended Plot; and <HI>Hughson</HI> asked him several Times, <HI>whether he would engage in it?</HI> And he as often answered him <HI>Yes:</HI> But Hughson seemed to distrust him, and brought a Book, which he took to be a Common-Prayer Book, and would have had him <HI>swear to it;</HI> but he refused to swear to it at that Time, and went away in Half an Hour: <HI>Hughson</HI> told him at the same Time, that Vaarck's <HI>Caesar,</HI> Philipse's <HI>Cuffee</HI> and Auboyneau's <HI>Prince,</HI> and a great many more were to be concerned with them.<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><HI>If what this Negro says, it true, this hellish Plot was some Years a brooding before they attempted the Execution of it; and those Negroes last mentioned were some of the Heads and Principals of their Colour that were concerned in it.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. That he used afterwards to go to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House whilst he continued to live upon the Dock; and <HI>Hughson</HI> and he used to talk now and then about the intended Plot, and <HI>Hughson</HI> used to say, he would find Arms and Pow∣der, but desired he would get some too; to which <HI>Adam</HI> answered, he had no Money to buy them: <HI>Hughson</HI> thereupon advised him to steal some for that Purpose.</P>
<P N="5">5. That about four or five Days after drinking the Bowl of Punch as aforesaid, he met <HI>Cuffee</HI> (Philipse's) who said, that <HI>Hughson</HI> had informed him that he <HI>(Adam)</HI> had engaged in the Plot; <HI>Cuffee</HI> said that he had a Key of his Master's Things, and he could come at what he pleased, and he could get some of his Master's Swords and Guns; but he <HI>(Adam)</HI> being in haste, heard no no more at that Time.</P>
<P N="6">6. That he has often seen <HI>Cuffee</HI> and <HI>Prince</HI> have plenty of Money about them, Silver and Gold; <HI>Cuffee</HI> had once two Doubloons, and offered to fight a Cock for one of them; and <HI>Prince</HI> had once eight or nine Spanish Dollars about him.</P>
<P N="7">7. That <HI>soon</HI> after <HI>Hughson</HI> removed to his House at the North River<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot"><HI>He removed thither in</HI> May, 1738. <HI>This House was more out of the Way, private and fit for</HI> Hughson's <HI>Purposes on all Accounts for caballiug and Entertainment of Negroes, and with respect to receiving stolen Goods; it was said to be built with such Privacies in the several Rooms and Cellars as might conceal run Goods.</HI></NOTE> he, <HI>Adam,</HI> used to resort thither; and upon his Enquiry concerning the Plot, <HI>Hughson</HI> told him, <HI>that several white Men were concerned with him in it, and a great many Negroes; and that he kept a List.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. That soon after New-Year Hollidays last, of a Sunday Afternoon (Church just going out) he, <HI>Adam,</HI> was walking by old Mr <HI>De Lancey'</HI>s, and met <HI>Jack</HI> his Fellow Servant, coming from <HI>Comfort'</HI>s with a Cag of Tea-Water; they stopped, and <HI>Jack</HI> told him he was just come from <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, and that there was Com∣pany there: <HI>Adam</HI> asked <HI>Jack</HI> to go back with him to drink a Dram there; and they went there together; and when they came into the House, he saw there in Company, <HI>Hughson, his Wife and Daughter, and four or five white People more</HI> (whose Faces he believes he should remember if he saw them) <HI>and the following Negroes,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Caesar,</HI> Pintard's, <HI>Caesar,</HI> Vaarck's, <HI>Prince,</HI> Auboyneau's; <HI>Brash,</HI> Jay's; <HI>Pompey,</HI> P.

<HI>swore him and Jack,</HI> and made them put their Hands on a Book, which he took to be a Common-Prayer Book, and made them kiss the Book; <HI>The Purport of the Oath was, That they were to be true to those concerned in the Plot; that they were to keep all secret, and perform what they had engaged to do; and if they discovered to any Body, that they might be split with Thunder and Lightning: They were to murder their Masters and Mi∣stresses, kill all the white People, and to burn the Houses:</HI> After they were sworn, <HI>Hughson</HI> shook them by the Hand and wished them much Joy.<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot"><HI>This agrees with</HI> Jack'<HI>s Account in the preceeding Examination, § 2, 3, 4, 5. and these Negroes were examined apart, and had no Opportunity of being or talking together after they were committed.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="9">9. That when <HI>Hughson</HI> first proposed the Swearing, he was scrupulous about being concerned in the Plot, and thought it was a great Sin to do any such Thing: But Hughson <HI>told him, there was a Man that he knew that could forgive him all his Sins</HI> Whereupon he took the Oath. And when <HI>Jack</HI> and he had drank their Dram out, they came away together,</P>
<P N="10">10. That after this Meeting at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, <HI>he saw a little short Man<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">John Ury <HI>the Priest</HI></NOTE> four or five Times at</HI> Hughson'<HI>s, who used to teach School at</HI> Campbell'<HI>s, who has just now been shewn him in Prison, who</HI> Hughson <HI>told him was one of the</HI> TWO PRIESTS <HI>who could forgive Sins;</HI> that he saw him twice in the Room at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, whispering and talking with him, when many Negroes were present; and he, <HI>Adam,</HI> then suspected that the little Man knew of the Plot, and was concerned in it; but does not remember that <HI>Hughson</HI> or th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Negroes talked out con∣cerning the Plot when that Man was present:<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot"><HI>This agrees with</HI> Mary Burton'<HI>s Deposition concerning</HI> Ury, NUMB.

<P N="11">11.

<P N="12">12. That he saw <HI>Holt,</HI> the Dancing-Master, at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s about New-Year Hollidays, at a Meeting of the Negroes, and another white Man belonging to him, whom they called <HI>Doctor</HI><NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Hamilton, <HI>a pretended Doctor who lodged at</HI> Holt'<HI>s</HI></NOTE> and lodged at <HI>Holt'</HI>s, whose Name he knows not: There was likewise <HI>Holt'</HI>s Negro <HI>Joe</HI> with them; and the Discourse amongst them was about the Plot; and he, <HI>Adam,</HI> took <HI>Holt</HI> and the other white Man to be concerned. At last he saw <HI>Hughson</HI> bring a Book to swear them; and they laid their Hands upon it, and <HI>Hughson</HI> pronounced the following Words, or something to the same Effect, <HI>That they should be true to one another, and aid and assist in the Plot, and not discover any Secrets;</HI> and then they kissed the Book: And then Holt's Negro <HI>Joe</HI> was sworn to the same Purpose and in the same Manner; and Holt <HI>commanded</HI> Joe <HI>that he should set fire to the Play-House at such Time as he should tell him:</HI> Holt's <HI>Joe</HI> had before this been telling him <HI>(Adam)</HI> that his Master was concerned, was to be one of them, and would go down such a Night to <HI>Hughson's</HI> to be sworn; and he asked him <HI>(Adam)</HI> to go down to see him sworn; which was the Reason that carried him to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s that Night.</P>
<P N="13">13. That <HI>Holt</HI> told <HI>Hughson</HI> that he had Guns of his own, and Powder he said. he had not enough: <HI>Hughson</HI> answered, he need not make himself uneasy about that, <HI>he had seven or eight Barrels.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. That <HI>Holt</HI> promised his Man <HI>Joe</HI> to give him Pistols, and asked him <HI>(Adam)</HI> whether his Master had any Arms? he, <HI>Adam,</HI> answered, he had some Pistols; <HI>Holt</HI> advised him to get some; and he said he would, but Powder he said he could not get; But both <HI>Hughson</HI> and <HI>Holt</HI> promised to supply him therewith.</P>
<P N="15">15. That one of the four or five white Men before mentioned to have been seen by him one Time at <HI>Hughson's</HI> was one of <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Brothers, a Boatman (as he now recollects) he had a Boat there; and he saw <HI>John Hughson</HI> give him a small Box to put into it, to carry up the River.</P>
<P N="16">16. That some time last Summer, he, <HI>Adam,</HI> helped <HI>Quack</HI> (Walter's) ride his Master's Coach-Horses out; and they came down to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s and went into the House; and <HI>Hughson</HI> carried them up Stairs, and swore <HI>Quack</HI> of the Plot in the same Manner, and the Oath to the same Purpose as Holt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He, <HI>Adam,</HI> only went down there in order to drink a Dram; and
<PB N="104" REF="005413_0112_10173A81E8425DB0"/>
<HI>Hughson</HI> asked <HI>Quack</HI> to be concerned in the Plot; <HI>and he directly answered Yes, and was sworn, as before;</HI> Hughson told him, that they were <HI>to burn the Houses and kill the white People;</HI> and <HI>Quack</HI> then undertook to burn his Master's House and <HI>cut his Throat;</HI> and <HI>that</HI> Quack <HI>was as great a Rogue as any of them.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. That Holt's <HI>Joe</HI> told him <HI>(Adam)</HI> not once, <HI>but an hundred and an hundred Times,</HI> that he, <HI>Adam,</HI> need not be afraid; for that his <HI>(Joe's)</HI> Master was concerned in the Plot; and that he had spoke to <HI>Hughson</HI> for the biggest Room he had there, <HI>to hold a Free Mason's Lodge.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a Free-Mason,</HI></NOTE></P>

That he, <HI>Adam,</HI> was at a Meeting at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s, which <HI>he believes was about a Fortnight after that at</HI> Hughson'<HI>s last mentioned;</HI> where were met a great Number of Negroes in the Kitchen and Shop; he, <HI>Adam,</HI> was in the Shop: This was also of a <HI>Sunday Afternoon</HI> Church just out; and there were present, his Fellow-Servant <HI>Jack,</HI> Marschalk's <HI>Diego,</HI> P.

Moore's) <HI>Patrick</HI> (English's) <HI>Ben</HI> (Marshall's) <HI>Albany,</HI> and Kierstede's <HI>Braveboy:</HI> There they all talked about the Plot; but he, <HI>Adam,</HI> staid but a little Time.</P>
<P N="20">20. That he has been acquainted with <HI>Quack</HI> (Walter's) from their Childhood, used to play Marbles together; and that he has often talked with him about the Plot, before the Frolick in the Bowry-Lane which <HI> Curacoa Dick</HI> told him of; and he always seemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be as active and forward in it as any Body.</P>
<P N="21">21. That one Sunday Morning last Summer, he and <HI>Pompey</HI> (P. De Lancey's) were taking a Walk, and they met at a Well by the New Dutch Church <HI>Othello</HI> and <HI>Braveboy,</HI> who were both very drunk; and <HI>Adam</HI> asked them where they had been? they said, they had been a frolicking in the Fields (he understood they had been at some free Negro's House in Bowry-Lane) at which Frolick <HI>Othello</HI> said that <HI>Robin</HI> and <HI>Sussex</HI> (Mrs. Bichley's Negroes) were present, and Tiebout's <HI>Curacoa Dick.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. That the same Sunday Morning he afterwards met the said <HI> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>racoa Dick,</HI> who said they had been dancing at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and he fiddled; and that <HI>Sussex</HI> paid him therefore <HI>two Pieces of Eight,</HI> which he called Dutch Dollars; he told him so before Mr. Cruger's Coachman <HI>Hanover;</HI> and the said <HI>Dick</HI> called him aside from <HI>Hanover,</HI> and told him that they had been talking there about the Plot, and said that <HI>Quack</HI> (Walter's) was there. And he, <HI>Adam,</HI> saw <HI>Quack</HI> (Walter's) leading a Horse into a Stable near the New Dutch Church, a little before he met <HI>Curacoa Dick,</HI> and he believes <HI>Pompey</HI> saw him also, but he and <HI>Pompey</HI> were parted before he, <HI>Adam,</HI> met <HI>Curacoa Dick;</HI> he, <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Pompey</HI> being going to their respective Master's Stables: He, <HI>Adam,</HI> observed that <HI>Quack</HI> was very drunk; just turned his Master's Horse into the Stable, and shut the Door and went away.</P>
<P N="23">23. That when he met <HI>Curacoa Dick,</HI> he said, Mate, we wanted you very much last Night at a Frolick out of Town; that they had a free Dance and were very merry; and he pulled two Dutch Dollars out of his pocket, which <HI>Sussex</HI> had given him for fiddling, and shewed them to him; and said no Body else had given him any Thing: He leaned upon the Post, and shook his Head when he, <HI>Adam,</HI> came up to him; and he, <HI>Adam,</HI> said, <HI>Dick, you have some ill Thoughts in your Head:</HI> Dick answered, he was not afraid to tell him; he would tell him <HI>the Truth;</HI> he then said, that <HI>Othello</HI> and <HI>Quack</HI> (walter's) <HI>both knew of the Plot;</HI> and that at this Frolick they all talked of it; and that there were present at that Meeting the Negroes following, <HI>Othello, Quack</HI> (Walter's) <HI>Braveboy, Robin, Sussex:</HI> This <HI>Dick</HI> told him before <HI>Hanover,</HI> Mr. Cruger's Coachman.</P>

<P N="25">25. That it was a great While ago since <HI>Quack</HI> (Walter's) told him that <HI>Othello</HI> was concerned in the Plot; that he has frequently talked to him about it; and he was to do the same that he and <HI>Jack</HI> were to do; that is to say, <HI>to kill his Master and Mistress, and the rest of the Family;</HI> and he, <HI>Adam,</HI> and the rest of them who were to murder Mr. MURRAY's Family, were to assist in murdering the Chief Justice's.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Jack's <HI>Examination,</HI> 26th June. § 10.</NOTE></P>

<P N="27">27.

That on Easter Sunday last, he and <HI>Jack</HI> his Fellow-Servant went down to the North River together; <HI>Jack</HI> was to fetch Tea-Water at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s: He went to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House, and <HI>Jack</HI> left his Cag at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s and followed him to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s; when they came there, they found in one Room, <HI>John Hughson, his Wife and Daughter Sarah,</HI> and <HI>Peggy,</HI> and the following Negroes, <HI>viz.</HI> Walter's <HI>Quack, Othello,</HI> Pintard's <HI>Caesar,</HI> Ward's <HI>Bill, Cuffee</HI> Philipse's, <HI>Prince</HI> Auboyneau's, <HI>Brash, Caesar</HI> Vaarck's, <HI>Billy</HI> Mrs. Sims's (now Ten Eyck's) and <HI>Albany;</HI> and <HI>John Hughson</HI> then proposed to the said Negroes, in Presence of the said white People, <HI>That they should meet at Mr.</HI> Murray's House <HI>that Night; and that</HI> Jack <HI>was to be in the kitchen, and open the Back-Gate, where all those other Negroes were to come in, and he,</HI> Adam, <HI>was to come down Stairs to them; and then they were to proceed to set fire to the House, murder his Master and Mistress, and all the white People in the Family;</HI> and he, <HI>Adam,</HI> was to murder <HI>Congo,</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI> to murder <HI>Caesar</HI> (two other of his Master's Negroes) and then all the said Negroes were to go out and <HI>kill all the white People that should come to extinguish the Fire:</HI> The Murder was to have been committed with Knives, and the Knife found in <HI>his</HI> (Adam's) <HI>Chest upon the general Search, was kept for that Purpose; but the Negroes so appointed, did not come that Night, though they all agreed and promised</HI> Hughson <HI>so to do, and upon which</HI> Hughson <HI>gave them a Bowl of Punch.</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Jack'<HI>s Examination,</HI> § 10, 11. <HI>Pag.</HI> 100, 101</NOTE></P>

<P N="31">31. That when <HI>Jack</HI> returned from fetching Water at <HI>Comfort'</HI>s, he was generally drunk; and from that suspected that he had been at <HI>Hughson's.</HI></P></Q>

<P>This Negro, <HI>Adam,</HI> was very willing to lay hold of the Benefit of the Proclamation beforementioned, but would intitle himself to it by saying as little as possible to enlarge the Discovery of the Confederates in this <HI>dark Scheme:</HI> He was under Examination several Hours, several Days running; the Information that he gave came from him slowly and by piece-meals, which was very tiresome; and gave so much Trouble, that he was several Times remanded to Jail, and told that what he said would do him little Service; but as the Constable was taking him away, he would beg to stay, and say he would tell of all he could recollect. While he was under Examination this Day, it was told before <HI>Adam,</HI> that the Chief Justice's Negro <HI>Othello</HI> was brought from <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> and carrying to Jail, and hearing that, he immediately said, <HI>Othello, was con∣cerned in the Plot;</HI> as if naturally concluding that some Body else had impeached him; for till this Accident, he had not mentioned his Name. This <HI>Adam</HI> had a general Acquaintance amongst the Negroes, and idle Time enough for doing any Mischief; and 'twas supposed, that he must have known most of the Negroes concerned; though he mentioned very few but what we were apprized of before, and had already been either executed or apprehended.</P>
<P>It was observed by several in Mr. <HI>Murray's</HI> Family, some Time before <HI>Adam's</HI> Commitment, that his Behaviour was such as betokened strong Symptoms of Guilt; he appeared very uneasy and disturbed in his Mind; and much more so when <HI>Jack</HI> his Fellow-Servant was taken up as one con∣cerned in the Conspiracy; for the next Morning he came several Times into the Clerk's Office, with a seeming Inten∣tion to disclose some Secret; the young Gentlemen at last took Notice of it, and shutting the Door too, asked him, Whether he knew any Thing of the Plot? He denied he did; but said, <HI>he was afraid some Dog or another would own him a Spite, and bring him in; for that People talked a great Deal of him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="005413_0114_10173A8B4F55C030"/>
In the Afternoon, Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> having been present and assisting at his Negro <HI>Jack's</HI> Examination, upon his Return home, found <HI>Adam</HI> running backwards and forwards like a distracted Creature; he called him into his Study, and charged him as one concerned in the Conspiracy; which he absolutely denied, and protested his Innocence: His Master endeavoured, and used many Arguments, to prevail with him to confess if he was guilty, but to no Purpose; and then he delivered him to the Constable.</P>
<P>In the Evening two of Mr. <HI>Murray's</HI> Clerks went to see <HI>Adam</HI> in the Jail, to try how far they could prevail upon him: and as soon as he knew they were come, he desired Leave to speak with them <HI>Privately;</HI> which being granted, he began with Exclamations, and Protestations of his Innocence, declaring <HI>that it was Nothing but damn'd Lies that brought him there; that he knew who was the Author of them, and would be revenged if he died for it.</HI> The young Gentlemen reasoned with him, telling him if he was innocent to insist upon it, and not be afraid; for he might be assured of having Justice done him; but if he was guilty, his denying it would signify Nothing; for that <HI>they</HI> knew as much of the Plot, as they that were concerned in it; and the only Way to recommend himself to Favour, was by making a full Confession: He then considered a while; and desired to know his Accuser; they told him, they believed it was <HI>Jack;</HI> which assoon as he heard, he said, <HI>then I am a dead Man; striking his Head against one of the Beams of the Jail;</HI> and said further, <HI>he was afraid the Dog would have served him so.</HI> Then he gave the young Gentlemen his Shoe-and Knee-Buckles [being Silver] and some other Things, desiring they might be delivered to his Brother <HI>Caesar</HI> [another Negro of Mr <HI>Murray'</HI>s.] In this Manner they parly'd with him a full Hour, 'til at length, tired with his Obstinacy, they concluded to leave him; but he pressed them to stay, still giving them some Hopes of his Confession: They told him they had no Occasion to stay to hear him repeat the same Things over again: He then asked them, what they would have him to say? Upon which they told him, they would have him <HI>speak sincerely,</HI> whether he was <HI>guilty or not:</HI> Why then said he, <HI>to speak sincerely, I am guilty.</HI></P>

<P>Now many Negroes began to squeak, in order to lay hold of the Benefit of the Proclamation; some who had been apprehended but not indicted; and many who had been indicted and arraigned, who had pleaded <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> were disposed to retract their Pleas and plead <HI>Guilty,</HI> and throw themselves on the Mercy of the Court; so that Confessions were like to be numerous, and Business to mul∣tiply upon our Hands; which made it necessary to call in some Gentlemen of the Law to our Assistance upon the Occasion, who very readily undertook the Task.</P>
<P>Before the issuing of the Proclamation of the 19th Instant, <HI>for the Encouragement of the Conspirators to come in, and make voluntary and free confession and Discovery, &amp;c.</HI> there were betwixt Sixty and Seventy Negroes in Jail. who had been already impeached; many of whom after publishing the Proclamation, not only confessed their own Guilt, in order to entitle themselves to the Benefit of it, as may appear by the foregoing Examinations; but also discovered many of their Accomplices who were at large; who were thereupon immediately taken into Custody, by Order of the Judges, or Grand Jury, as the Case happen'd before whom such Confessions were made; so that between the 19th and this Day, there were upwards of Thirty Slaves more added to the former, insomuch that the Jail began to be so thronged, 'twas difficult to find Room for them: and we were apprehensive, that the Criminals would be daily multiplying on our Hands; nor could we see any Likelihood of a Stop to Impeachments; for it seemed very probable that most of the Negroes in Town were corrupted.</P>
<P>The Season began to grow warm, as usual; and 'twas to be expected that the Heat would be increasing upon us daily; so that the Judges found there was a Necessity of bethinking themselves of taking such speedy Measures; as should upon Deliberation be thought most adviseable, for ridding the Jail of such of them as should by their Con∣fessions be thought most deserving of Recommendation to Mercy; for 'twas feared such Numbers of them closely confined together, might breed an Infection; and they must needs have been very offensive to the poor Debtors impri∣soned in the City-Hall, which from the Necessity of the Case could not have been prevented or remedied: There∣fore the Judges associated to them the several Gentlemen of the Law that were in Town, <HI>viz.</HI> Messieurs MURRAY, ALEXANDER, SMITH, CHAMBERS, JAMISON, NICHOLLS and LODGE, in order to consult about this Matter, and come to some Resolution upon the Emergency.</P>
<P>The Result of the Meeting was, those Gentlemen unanimously agreed to bear their respective Shares in the Fatigue of the several Prosecutions; and settled among themselves the Part each should take: Messieurs MURRAY, ALEXANDER, SMITH and CHAMBERS, were to assist in their Turns, as Council upon the several Trials, as it should best suit their respective Convenience, and Messieurs NICHOLLS and LODGE, to take the Negroes Confessions, and abstract them and the other Evidence into Briefs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Council upon the Trials. [Mr. JAMISON being High-Sheriff of the City, had other sufficient Business upon his Hands.]</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="005413_0116_10173A9022A3C858"/>
The Gentlemen thus assign'd for taking the Confessions having attended most of the Trials of the Conspirators already pass'd, and likewise several Examinations of Cri∣minals, were well acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Account of the Plot, according to the Course of the Evidence concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which had hitherto been brought to Light; and as 'twas to be expected, they would have their Hands full of that kind of Business, 'twas necessary that some Scheme should be settled for the more ready Dispatch of it: Accordingly a Method was proposed, and appoved amongst us; a Draught with several Columns, <HI>viz.</HI> One for the Name of each Negro; another for his respective Owner; another for the Matter or Substance of the Confession; another for the Negroes they accused; and two others for the Place where sworn at, <HI>viz. Hughson's</HI> or <HI>Comfort'</HI>s; for <HI>Jack, Comfort'</HI>s Negro, was a principal Agent for <HI>Hughson,</HI> and (as may already have been observed from the Course of the Evidence) had corrupted many Negroes, and administred the Conspirators Oath to them.</P>
<P>The Negroes in general that came to a Confession agreed in the Impeachment of <HI>Hughson and his Family;</HI> that the Drift of the Plot was <HI>to burn the Town and destroy the Inhabitants;</HI> that they were <HI>sworn</HI> into the Confederacy at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, or by <HI>Hughson,</HI> or some Person intrusted by him for that Purpose.</P>
<P>As this was already discovered to be the execrable Purpose of the Conspiracy, these Gentlemen (considering the great Number to be examined) for the Sake of Dispatch, dropt what was at this Time least material, and only minuted down the Persons accused, the Matter affecting them, where and by whom sworn, and what else came from their Examinant which they judged to be most significant; which is the Reason that the Examinations and Confessions taken by those two Gentlemen are so concise.</P>
<P><HI>But further;</HI> in order to save Room, and avoid drawing out this <HI>JOURNAL</HI> to an unnecessary Length, which of itself is like to spin out to a Degree beyond Patience; the Compiler chose not to set them forth in the same Manner they were taken, but made them yet shorter, by incorpo∣rating the Substance of the several Columns into the Form in which they now appear.</P>

<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Gomez, <HI>Pray tell the Prisoners at the Bar, that the Court observes,</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> THAT they were taken with some <HI>Spaniards</HI> by an <HI>English</HI> Privateer; were brought into this Port, and condemned as lawful Prize, being suppos'd to be Slaves belonging to the Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and Nothing appear'd to the Court of Admiralty (which is the Court, to which Jurisdiction concerning Things of this Nature does properly belong) to shew that they were Freemen; and they having made no Pretence or Claim in that Court to be such, they were therefore adjudg'd to be Slaves.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> That the Court of Admiralty having so ad∣judg'd them to be Slaves, they had been severally sold and disposed of; by which means they were discharged from Confinement in Prison; and thereby have had the Opportunity of caballing with other wicked, mischievous and evil disposed Persons, as well White-Men as Slaves, and have confederated themselves with them, in a most diabolical Conspiracy, <HI>to lay this City in Ashes, and to murder and destroy all the Inhabitants;</HI> whereas had they appear'd to have been Freemen, they would have been prevented this Opportunity of venting and gratifying the Rancour of their Hearts, by being closely confined as Prisoners of War.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> If notwithstanding they were Free-men, they ought in all Reason to have waited the Event of the War, and suffer'd patiently under their Misfortune; and when Peace should have been concluded, they might have made the Truth of their Pretensions appear, and then Justice would have been done them.</P>
<P>But now, as they are found <HI>Guilty</HI> of this most horrid and villainons Conspiracy, by the Laws of our Land, Nothing remains but to pronounce Sentence of Death against them.</P></Q>
<P>Accordingly they were Sentenced to be hanged.</P>

<P>This Day <HI>Prince,</HI> Duane's: <HI>Tony,</HI> Latham's; <HI>Cato,</HI> Shurmur's; <HI>Harry,</HI> Kip's; and <HI>York,</HI> Marschalk's, Negroes, were executed at the Gallows, according to Sentence; and the Body of <HI>York</HI> was afterwards hung in Chains, upon the same Gibbet with <HI>John Hughson.</HI></P>
<P>Some few Days before this, the Town was amused with a Rumour, that <HI>Hughson</HI> was turned <HI>Negro,</HI> and Vaarck's <HI>Caesar</HI> a <HI>White;</HI> and when they came to put up <HI>York</HI> in Chains by <HI>Hughson</HI> (who was hung upon the Gibbet three Weeks before) so much of him as was visible, <HI>viz.</HI> Face, Neck, Hands and Feet, were of a deep shining Black, rather blacker than the Negro placed by him, who was one of the darkest Hue of his Kind; and the Hair of <HI>Hughson</HI>'s Beard and Neck (his Head could not be seen, for he had a Cap on) was curling like the Wool of a Negro's Beard and Head; and the Features of his Face were of the Symmetry of a Negro Beauty; the Nose broad and flat, the Nostrils open and extended, the Mouth wide, Lips full and thick, his Body, (which when living, was tall by the View upwards of six Feet, but very meagre) swell'd to a Gigantick Size; and as to <HI>Caesar</HI> (who, tho' executed for a Robbery, was also one of the Head Negro Conspirators, had been hung up in Chains a Month before <HI>Hughson,</HI> and was also of the darkest Complexion) his Face was at the same Time somewhat bleach'd or turned whitish; insomuch that it occasion'd a Remark, That <HI>Hughson</HI> and <HI>he</HI> had changed Colours. The Beholders were amazed at these Appearances; the Report of them engaged the Attention of many, and drew Numbers of all Ranks, who had Curiosity, to the Gibbets, for several Days running, in order to be convinced by their own Eyes, of the Reality of Things so confidently reported to be, at least, wonderous Phaenomenons; and upon the View they were found to be such as have been described: Many of the Spectators were ready to resolve them into Miracles; however, others not so hasty, though surprized at the Sights, were willing to account for them in a natural Way; so that they admi∣nistred Matter for much Speculation.</P>
<P>The Sun at this Time had great Power, and the Season as usual very hot, that <HI>Hughson</HI>'s Body drip'd and distill'd very much, as it needs must, from the great Fermentation and Abundance of Matter within him, as could not but be supposed <HI>at that Time,</HI> from the extraordinary Bulk of his Body; tho' considering the Force of the Sun, and the natural Meagreness of his Crops, one would have been apt to imagine, that long 'ere this, it would have been disen∣cumbered of all its Juices. At length, about ten Days or a Fortnight after <HI>Hughson</HI>'s Mate, <HI>York,</HI> was hung by him, <HI>Hughson</HI>'s Corps unable longer to contain its Load, burst and discharged Pails full<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Which may be understood to mean a surprizing Quantity.</HI></NOTE> of Blood and Corruption; This was testified by those who were near by, fishing upon the Beach when the Irruption happen'd, to whom the Stench of it was very offensive.</P>
<P>Those who were inclined to account in a natural Way, for what was by some esteemed almost miraculous, by all very surprizing, observed, that by the written Evidences of Witnesses, both Black and White, Information was given of Poison being distributed amongst the Conspirators,<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> William Kane<HI>'s Examination.</HI> § 16. <HI>pa.</HI> 128.</NOTE> and <HI>of the Use their Principals intended should have been made of it;</HI> <Q><HI>Harry,</HI> a Negro Doctor, was to bring the Negroes Poison <HI>to use</HI> (if they were discovered and taken) <HI>before they were executed; Kane</HI> had seen him give Poison (as they called it) to Walter's <HI>Quack</HI> for that Purpose, <HI>in Papers; Quack</HI> said, <HI>he should not be suspected, he</HI> might go to the Prison <HI>to carry Victuals;</HI> and <HI>so could give the Poison</HI> to those that were condemned, <HI>to prevent their Execution</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>This Office we may suppose was to be administer'd by</HI> Quack, without the Knowledge of the Patients <HI>(and he speaks as if they had a Confidence in him) in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>patch them, and</HI> prevent their telling Tales: <HI>For when they found themselves in Jeopardy there might be danger of their speaking the Truth, and discovering their Principals, in hopes of saving their own Lives by it.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Kane,</HI> saw Doctor <HI>Harry</HI> give a large Quantity [of it] to <HI>Hughson.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="005413_0132_10173AC1B42549F8"/>
<HI>Mary Burton</HI> speaks of their having Poison amongst them<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In her Evidence upon Trial of eight Negroes 15th of this Month,</HI> viz. <HI>her Testimony against</HI> Doctor Harry.</NOTE> she says, <Q>She had seen <HI>three or four Papers</HI> of Poison in <HI>Hughson</HI>'s Drawers, which she understood he had of some Negro.</Q></P>
<P>It has been related already<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 72.</NOTE> that <HI>Hughson</HI> when he was brought out of Jail to be carried to his Execution, had a red Spot in each Cheek, about the Bigness of a Shilling, which at that Time was by some thought very remarkable, because he was always pale of Visage; and the Sheriff (who observed it) did not believe, from the Care that had been ta∣ken, he could have drank any strong Liquor in Jail; which was an additional Reason why they took so much Notice of it.</P>
<P>Upon the Supposition that <HI>Hughson</HI> had taken Poison, it has been made a Question, whether that might not have occasioned the Swelling of his Corps to so amazing a Bulk? Nay his Arms, Legs, and Thighs, were enlarged in Pro∣portion to the Body; this is submitted to the Consideration of the Curious and Connoisseurs in <HI>Physick.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Change of Complexions in <HI>Hughson</HI> and <HI>Caesar,</HI> some imputed it to the Influence of the Sun; but to that it was objected, it would be strange indeed, that the Sun should have two such different Effects as to turn <HI>Hughson</HI> [a White] black, and <HI>Caesar</HI> [a Negro] whitish.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Hughson</HI>'s taking Poison, that by some was thought very improbable; for, as 'tis said, in the Account of his Behaviour at, and going to his Execution, his Actions were observed to be such, as betokened his Expectation of being rescued; he held up his Hand as high as his Pinion would admit of, and seemed to beckon with his Finger, as one expecting Deliverance; and if that was his Persuasion, he would not have taken Poison, which was certain Death; and besides, if he had taken any, he would have taken a sufficient Quantity, and Time enough, to have answered the Design of it, which must be supposed to be, to destroy himself to prevent his Execution.</P>
<P>To this it was answered, that though he might be deter∣mined to take Poison to destroy himself, and did take some, yet he might do it with so much Reluctance, as not to take the Quantity prescribed sufficient to answer the End; which tho' he might not be aware of, but expect certain Death from it, yet the nearer he approached the Gallows, the more his Thoughts might be confused, and Nature pre∣vailed; as long as there is Life, there is Hopes, and his Deliverance might be uppermost in his Mind; he would willingly have avoided the Infamy of Hanging, and stand the Chance of saving his Life into the Bargain.</P>
<P>Whatever were the Causes of these Changes, the Facts are here related, that every one may make their own Con∣ectures upon them.</P>
<P>But <HI>Hughson</HI> it seems, let the worst happen to him in all Events, declared as he was going to mount the Cart which was to carry him to Execution, <Q>that he did not doubt but some remarkable Sign would happen to him, to shew [or signify] <HI>his Innocence,</HI></Q> and if his Corps becoming mon∣strous in Size, and his Complexion (for once to use a vulgar Similitude) as black as the D—1, can be deemed remarkable Signs or Tokens of <HI>his Innocence!</HI> then some may imagine, it has happen'd according to his Expectation.</P>

<P>THE Jail being now throng'd with Negroes committed as Confederates in the Conspiracy, many whereof had made Confessions of their Guilt, in Hopes of Pardon in Consequence of the Proclamation, and others who were pardoned and turned Evidence; it was feared, considering the Season of the Year, that such Numbers closely confin'd might be apt to breed an Infection; therefore the Judges thought it was proper to examine the List of them, and to to mark out such as should be thought proper to recommend to his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, to be pardoned, upon Condition of Transportation to be therein limited by a short Time, and to distinguish which of them who had been made Use of as Witnesses, might be necessary to reserve for some Time; and for this Purpose they associated to them Mr. <HI>Nicholls</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lodge,</HI> by whose Assistance the following List was accordingly settled, which the Judges reported to his Honour, and submitted to his Consideration.</P>

This Day <HI>Will,</HI> Ward's Negro, was executed according to Sentence, and made the following Confession at the Stake.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. <HI>HE said,</HI> That <HI>William Kane,</HI> a Soldier belonging to the Fort, knew of the Plot; and he heard the said <HI>Kane</HI> say, he did not care if the <HI>Fort</HI> was burnt down: That since the Plot was discovered he told <HI>Kane</HI> he would make a Discovery; on which <HI>Kane gave him three Pounds in Bills,</HI> and told him, not to discover; Part of which Money his young Mistress <HI>found in his Chest.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That his Mistress lost a Silver Spoon, which he, <HI>Will,</HI> stole and carried to <HI>Kane's Wife,</HI> who gave it her Husband in his Presence, and he sold it to <HI>Peter Van Dyke,</HI> a Silver-Smith, and gave him [<HI>Will</HI>] eight Shillings of the Money.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>Kane and Kelly</HI><NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Both Soldiers belonging to the Garrison, and reputed Papists.</HI></NOTE> asked <HI>Quack</HI> to burn the Fort, and said if that was done, they (the Soldiers) would have their Liberty; and <HI>Kelly</HI> said, you must do it with some wet Cotten, and that will <HI>make no Smoke.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That he has talked of the Plot with <HI>Kane</HI> and <HI>Kelly</HI> often, and has been at <HI>Kane'</HI>s House, and <HI>has heard that other Soldiers were concerned,</HI> but does not know them. That he has seen <HI>Quack</HI> (Walter's) there, Ryndert's <HI>Tom,</HI> Governour's <HI>Jack,</HI> Cuyler's <HI>Pedro;</HI><NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>This Negro not apprehended.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>John</HI> (Vanzant's) went round, <HI>who received some Money in his Hat, collected at a Meeting at</HI> Kelly'<HI>s, which Money was to be paid to</HI> Hughson.</P>
<P N="5">5. That <HI>Quack,</HI> Goelet's, and <HI>Will,</HI> Tiebout's, drew him in; and called on their Names to the last.</P>
<P N="6">6. That <HI>Pedro</HI> (De Peyster's) is innocent for what he knows.</P>
<P N="7">7. That Moore's <HI>Cato</HI> advised him and <HI>Pedro,</HI> to bring in many Negroes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elling <HI>Pedro,</HI> that he would be certainly burnt or hanged if he did not confess; but that if he brought in a good many, it would save his Life; for he had found it so himself; and must say, he was to set his Master's House on fire, which would make the Judges believe him.<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Pedro <HI>by</HI> Schultz'<HI>s Deposition of the first Instant, charges</HI> Will <HI>himself with giving that Advice: But these are</HI> Will'<HI>s dying Words in the Midst of Flames, and may be supposed to come from him upon a Question put, Whether he had not advised</HI> Pedro <HI>so? So rare is it to get the Truth from these Wretches!</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="8">8. That Pintard's <HI>Caesar</HI> said much the same; and Comfort's <HI>Jack</HI> advised <HI>Cato;</HI> but <HI>that</HI> Jack <HI>was a true Evidence.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Pile being kindled, this Wretch set his Back to the Stake, and raising up one of his Legs, laid it upon the Fire, and lifting up his Hands and Eyes, cried aloud, and several Times repeated the Names, <HI>Quack Goelet &amp; Will Tiebout,</HI> who he had said brought him into this Plot.</P>
<P>This Evening <HI>William Kane,</HI> Soldier, <HI>Quack,</HI> Goelet's, and <HI>Will,</HI> Tiebout's, Negroes, were apprehended and committed.</P>
<P>After we had several of the Fires mentioned in the Introduction to this <HI>JOURNAL, Quack,</HI> Goelet's, was had up and examined before the Magistrates, for some suspicious Words overheard to be uttered by him, to another Negro, which seemed to import strong Hints as if he had been privy to the Occasion of them; but nothing could be made of it, and was therefore discharged. But this was long before we had the least Intimation of a Conspiracy.</P>

<P>While <HI>Kane</HI> was under Examination, the Under-Sheriff came and informed the Judges, that <HI>Mary Burton</HI> had declared, that she had often seen him at <HI>Hughson</HI>'s, amongst <HI>Hughson, his Wife,</HI> &amp;<HI>c. and the Negroes,</HI> when they were talking of the Conspiracy, and that he was one of the Confederates: Whereupon she was ordered to be brought in; and being confronted with <HI>Kane,</HI> she immediately declared to the Effect in the following Deposition: The Chief Justice, who was a Stranger to the Transactions concerning the Detection of the Conspiracy (having been absent attending the Execution of his Majesty's special Commission at <HI>Providence</HI>) he thought proper to admonish the Witness in an awful and solemn Manner, concerning the Nature of an Oath, and the Consequences of taking a false one, more especially as it affected a Man's Life: She answered, she was acquainted with the Nature of an Oath very well, and that she would not take a false one upon any Account; and repeated the same Charge against <HI>Kane</HI> over and over, and persisted in it, that what she said was Truth; all which <HI>Kane</HI> as positively denied; whereupon she was sworn, and the following Evidence taken.</P>

<P>The Reason of the Resolution for executing the Negro Wench <HI>Sarah,</HI> was, that upon the Trial of <HI>Cuffes,</HI> Gomez's; <HI>Robin,</HI> Chambers's; <HI>Caesar,</HI> Peck's; <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Cook,</HI> Comfort's, and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Ellison's, six of the Negro Conspirators, she was found endorsed upon the Indictment as a Witness against every one of them, excepting only <HI>Jamaica;</HI> and when she was called to give her Evidence, she prevaricated grossly, and differed so widely from what was penned down from her in her several Examinations, that the Court could give no further Credit to her Evidence: so that she deservedly drew the Rope about her own Neck.</P>

That he did not know in what Part of the Town <HI>Hughson</HI> did live, nor did not remember to have heard of the Man 'til it was a common Talk over the Town and Country, that <HI>Hughson</HI> was concerned in a Plot with the Ne∣groes.</Q><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>A Criminal confesses himself</HI> guilty <HI>at his own Peril; it may be the only Chance he has for saving his Life; if he denies all, and the Crime is proved upon him, his Case becomes desperate: But when once he confesses his Guilt, it will be standing Evidence against him.</HI>—<HI>The Remark upon Negro Recantations once for all, is, That one can scarce be thoroughly satisfied when it is that they do speak Truth, unless what they say be confirmed by concurring Circumstances; and</HI> the very Sight only of their Masters <HI>may make them change their Notes at any Time,</HI> if they give them not Advice and Instruction with Respect to their Conduct, <HI>which there was too just Reason to believe some of them did; and perhaps many of these Wretches buoy'd themselves up with the Notion, that their Masters would at all Hazards save them from the Gallows, or Transportation,</HI> if they could; <HI>especially such of the Slaves as had been bred up to Trades or Handicrafts; they might flatter themselves that the Want of them would be a great Prejudice and Damage to their Owners; at if for their Sakes, vile Wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shes, the whole Town must run the Risque of their Houses being fired about their Ears, and having the Inhabitants butchered: But their having once confessed their Guilt, a Recantation and Denial of it afterwards, will scarce be thought an Argument of sufficient Force to prove their Innocence.—The Commissioners who tried the Negro Conspirators upon the Detection of the Plot in</HI> Antigua, <HI>in the Year 1736, in the Report of their Proceedings to their Governor, have the following Clause</HI> a propos <HI>to the aforegoing Observations,</HI> § 20, <HI>say they,</HI> <Q><HI>There were some Steps not of a common Kind taken by us in the Course of our Enquiry, which possibly might have been excepted to; Two Particulars; One, the Trying the Criminals privately, excluding all white Persons</HI> (more particularly the Masters of Slaves) <HI>excepting the Constables guarding the Prisoners, and excepting twice or thrice where some Gentlemen of Figure (not Masters of any Slaves under Trial) were accidentally present;</HI> [<HI>the other not being material to the present Purpose is omitted</HI>] <HI>It goes on,</HI>—<HI>As to the first, we had expe∣rienced the contrary Method in the Beginning, by trying some of the Criminals</HI> openly; <HI>but the Business being</HI> of a Nature requiring the utmost Dispatch, <HI>we found our Proceedings much retarded by the Spectators asking many Questions of the Prisoners and Witnesses,</HI> and some of them not proper; <HI>we soon discovered too (by some Things that happened)</HI> how much Masters were prone to countenance and excuse their Slaves, and that Slaves were emboldened by their Master's Pre∣sence, and Witnesses intimidated; <HI>besides</HI> we found Secresy necessary, <HI>which even Oaths of Secresy might not have effectually procured, considering human Frailty and Forgetfulness, and the common Unguardedness of Speech most Persons are liable to; for sometimes a dangerous Criminal might be mentioned by Witnesses as Parties accused in the Course of the Trial, and this might be talked of abroad, and occasion Flights and Concealments,</HI> &amp; <HI>other Inconveniences not to be foreseen.</HI></Q> <HI>In our own Case, Masters and Owners of Slaves were admitted as Witnesses, which, all Things considered, per∣haps was</HI> too great an Indulgence: <HI>It is a known Rule of Law in civil Cases,</HI> That a Party interested in the Event of a Suit cannot be a Witness; <HI>and by a Parity▪ of Reason it may be concluded, that Masters of Slaves in criminal Cases, should not be Witnesses, especially in Matters of so much Consequence to the Publick; and if any such like Case should hereafter happen, which God forbid, upon the Reason of that Rule, and the Inconve∣niences which have happened</HI> from this Indulgence, <HI>it may be judged necessary to vary from that Practice.</HI></NOTE></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">NUMB. II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>HE said,</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">That about the Beginning of last Summer, <HI>Albany</HI> brought Meat to his Master's House. and asked him to go and drink a Dram with him, which he consenting to, <HI>Albany</HI> carried him to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, where <HI>Albany</HI> called for Liquor; and as <HI>Hughson</HI> did not bring it to them immediately, he, <HI>Albany,</HI> went into the House, and brought out a Two-penny Dram to <HI>Othello</HI> in the Yard; <HI>Albany</HI> told him that <HI>Hughson</HI> desired him, <HI>Othello,</HI> to stay a little, for he wanted to speak with him; <HI>Othello</HI> said he could not stay then, but that he would come there in the Evening.</Q></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="2">2. He went again about Dusk in the Evening, and <HI>Albany</HI> was not there; <HI>Hughson</HI> and <HI>Othello</HI> began to talk about the Plot; and <HI>Hughson</HI> would fain have made him <HI>swear;</HI> but he refused, saying, another Time would do as well: <HI>Hughson</HI> told him, <HI>if he would swear, he should never want for Liquor, it should not cost him any Thing; and desired he would bring his Acquaintance with him, and he would make them wellcome:</HI> he thanked him, and went home: Was at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s about an Hour.</P>
<P N="3">3. The 30<HI>th of October last, Albany</HI> brought Meat to his Master's House, and then asked <HI>Othello</HI> whether he would go to Dinner at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, the Drummers being to have a Feast there that Day?<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>The</HI> Militia Drummers, <HI>who were Negroes, idle Fellows no doubt; Fidlers of that Colour, many Drum∣mers, and others, were tempted by</HI> Hughson'<HI>s great Hospitality: 'Tis somewhat amazing! how</HI> Hughson, <HI>a poor Cobler, with a Wife and House full of Children, and scarce any visible Business, or Means of Subsistence, should be able to support such extraordinary Generosity.</HI></NOTE> He answered, that his Master was to be at home that Day, and that he could not go.</P>

4. <HI>Albany</HI> often brought Meat there, and would always ask him to go and drink at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s; and as Op∣portunity served, sometimes he went, and sometimes not.</P>
<P N="5">5. About a <HI>Year ago</HI> he went one Evening down to the North River to swim, and there met with <HI>Albany;</HI> they went into <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, and he made them a Tankard of Punch; <HI>Hughson,</HI> endeavoured again to make <HI>them swear,</HI> and <HI>brought a Book to him;</HI> he still put it off; then <HI>Hughson</HI> told him if he would not, he, <HI>Othello,</HI> must not tell any body what he had been talking about.</P>
<P N="6">6. He has seen <HI>many Soldiers</HI> at <HI>Hughson,</HI>s at different Times, <HI>very great with</HI> Hughson, but cannot tell whe∣ther they knew or were concerned in the Plot; but knows that <HI>Kane</HI> was one of them,<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>And</HI> Kane <HI>it seems knew well that he was.</HI></NOTE> and believes he, <HI>Kane, can name the Rest: Hughson</HI> promised <HI>Othello</HI> to find him a Gun and Cutlass, and told him, <HI>if he did any Damage, he would commit no Sin thereby: Othello</HI> understood, it would not hinder him from going to Heaven.</P>
<P N="7">7. Vaarck's <HI>Caesar</HI> told <HI>Othello,</HI> that Rutgers's <HI>Quash</HI> was to find Arms: Mr. Philipse's <HI>Cuffee</HI> was likewise spoke to by <HI>Othello,</HI> about the Conspiracy, and asked whether <HI>he was sworn?</HI> Cuffee answered <HI>Yes, are not you? Othello</HI> said No, I have only promised <HI>to keep the Secret.</HI> Said, he had not spoke to any one since about it.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Adam</HI> told <HI>Othello</HI> (since their being in the Jail) that he, <HI>Adam, was to have killed his Master and Mistress sure enough;</HI> and advised <HI>Othello</HI> to confess, that he was to have killed his Master and Mistress, that that would be a Means of getting him off.</P></Q>

<P N="3">3.

<P N="5">5. That he did not know that the Fort was to be fired, nor when they were to begin to set fire to the Town; <HI>Hughson</HI> said <HI>Albany</HI> should tell him, who was the first that told him of the Plot, and that was the first Time he carried him down to <HI>Hughson</HI>'s, in <HI>June was Twelve Months,</HI> just about the Time <HI>the Cuba Peo∣ple</HI> came here.</P>
<P N="6">6. That Col.

<P N="7">7. <HI>Hughson</HI> asked him, if he could not get some of his Master's Guns; but he told him, that he could not come at them.</P>
<P N="8">8. That <HI>Adam</HI> persuaded him, since he came in Jail, to say, that he had agreed to kill his Master and Mis∣tress; and that by saying so, he would get clear: But this was all false, he never engaged to do any such Thing, nor was it ever proposed to him by <HI>Hughson,</HI> or any one else; <HI>only</HI> Hughson told him, he must rise with the Mob, and <HI>kill the People in general,</HI> as the rest were to do.</P>

<P>This Negro behaved upon this Occasion with a great deal of Composure and Decency; with an Air of Sincerity, which very much affected the Recorder: For from the Intimacy he had the Honour of with his Master, he had frequent Opportunities of seeing this Negro at his House, and <HI>Othello</HI>'s Case, could not but move some Compassion; but all Things considered, when calmly reflected upon▪ one could not yield entire Credit to his Protestations, more particularly as to the last Article: For <HI>Adam</HI> and he were well known to be familiar Acquaintances; and as they were both, by their own Confessions. <HI>sworn</HI> into this exe∣crable Engagement, this diabolical Conspiracy, it will scarce be believed but they knew each other were concer∣ned; and not only so, but must have had frequent Discourse about it.</P>

<HI>Othello</HI> being remanded, <HI>Quack,</HI> Walter's Negro, was sent for; and the Recorder asked him many Questions, and exhorted him to tell the Truth in what he should say, as he was in a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Moments to answer for his Words and Actions before God Almighty: But <HI>Quack</HI> said he knew nothing more of the Matter than what he had already de∣clared in his Confessions; so he was remanded.</P>

<P><HI>As to the Circumstances attending these two Negroes, as they appeared before the Court.</HI></P>
<P>THE Characters of these two miserable Wretches were well known: They had more Sense than the common Rank of Negroes; they had both, kind, indulgent Masters▪ they were two of the Head <HI>Negroes</HI> in Town; both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣lows of <HI>high Spirits;</HI> had both general Acquaintance, and great Influence amongst the inferiour Sort of Negroes; their Confessions were neither <HI>voluntary nor free,</HI> but came from them very unwillingly, and after much Persuasion; nor could the Judges lock upon them to be <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll;</HI> so that these Criminals were deficient in all the Particulars required by the Proclamation, as Essentials in a Recommendation to Mercy: They indeed acknowledged their Guilt in general, by their Plea, and by their Confessions, in a few Par∣ticulars, thinking thereby, as it may well be inferred, to come off as cheap as they could; for, perhaps, they might flatter themselves, that by Confessing what they did they should save their Lives: What they did say was very spa∣ring, and of little or no Significance, more especially what came from <HI>Quack;</HI> and there was great Reason to conjec∣ture they both had it in their Power to make very consider∣able Discoveries.</P>
<P><HI>Quack</HI> had been committed upon Suspicion, and was in Confinement some Time before any Evidence came to Light, which <HI>directly</HI> charged him as a Confederate in the Conspiracy; and he held it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stoutly, till the Procla∣mation of the 19th of <HI>June</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d, protesting he knew nothing at all of the Matter▪ 'Twas well known how much idle Time <HI>Quack</HI> had, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at his own Disposal, as if he were his own Master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and now at length, the Proofs that he was one of the Conspirators, came out to be strong against him; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> been impeached for a long while before indicted; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pretended to call Con∣fessions, were of little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as before observed; the first of them, <HI>viz.</HI> 23d <HI>June,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arged nothing more upon him∣self, than a bare <HI>Head knowledge</HI> (to use a modern cant Word) that there was a Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>piracy on Foot, <HI>to burn Houses▪</HI> which he by Accident, as it should seem, over∣heard Negroes a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of; not that he was any ways concerned, or had agreed to, and engaged in it: In the second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th <HI>June,</HI> indeed he goes a Step farther, and says, <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Day he was at <HI>Hughson's,</HI> and Vaarck's <HI>Caesar</HI> asked him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he would conclude along with them, to set <HI>a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Houses on Fire.</HI></Q> <HI>Quack</HI> readily (but it may be observed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Way, in such a Manner, as if he was no such Strang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the villainous Enterprize) told him, <Q><HI>He believed he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould,</HI> but would consider of it, and give him an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></Q> So that yet there was no Acknowledgment of <HI>Quack</HI>'s engaging himself, even in the Purpose of burning Houses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; not the least Hint that he so much as knew, or heard of any Design <HI>to murder and destroy the People.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Othello</HI> had been waiting upon his Master in <HI>New-England</HI> all this Summer, who left this Place soon after the Fire at the Fort, and had been attending at <HI>Providence,</HI> in <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Government, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Majesty's especial Commission: The Chief Justice it seems had many Times taken him to task there, after he was informed what had been doing amongst us, and well knowing the Nature and Disposition of <HI>Othello,</HI> he concluded if there was a Plot, he was very likely to have had a Hand in it; and he took a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal of Pains with him, endeavouring to persuade him to confess, if he was any ways engaged in it, or knew any Thing about it, assuring him at the same Time, that if he was Guilty, and would embrace that Opportunity, by making an ingenuous Confession, he would use his In∣terest with the Governor to save his Life: But on the Contrary, that if he went to <HI>New-York,</HI> and was tried and convicted, he would leave him to Justice without Mercy: But <HI>Othello</HI> withstood it all, notwithstanding his Master endeavoured several Times to prevail with him; and then, when the Chief Justice was advised of his being impeached, he took the first Opportunity of sending him by Water hither, in Irons; and immediately upon his Arrival, he was brought before, and examined by one of the Judges, who warned him of the Proclamation, and that the Time limitted for making <HI>voluntary, free</HI> and <HI>full Confession</HI> and <HI>Discovery,</HI> was to expire within two or three Days, and admonished him to embrace that Opportunity; but never∣theless, he obstinately persisted in Protestations of his Inno∣cence, and was committed; but the next Morning, when he had had Time to enquire of his Brother Criminals how Matters stood, he bethought himself, that 'twas proper for him to make some Confession and intimated that he would to one of the Chief Justice's Brothers; and the Day after that, the Judge sent for him down, and took the Confession Monday 30th <HI>June. p.</HI> 116.</P>
<P>The Aptness and Alacrity of these two Criminals for Mischief was monstrously remarkable, as declared in Evidence upon the Confessions of two of their own Colour and Ac∣complices, in the same savage▪ cruel and bloody Purpose; tho' <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Othello</HI> denied it to the last<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Jack, <HI>Mr.</HI> Murray<HI>'s Negro's Examination,</HI> § 10. 11. 12. <HI>pa.</HI> 100. 101.

<HEAD>The further Examination of Sarah Hughson. Before the Chief Justice.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">NUMB. II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>SHE said,</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">That she had often seen <HI>Ury the Priest</HI> at her Father's House, <HI>who used to come there in the Evenings and at Nights; and has seen him in Com∣pany with the Negroes, and talking with them about the Plot of burning the Town and destroying the White People.</HI></Q></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. That <HI>William Kane</HI> used often to come there with the Negroes; and once, as she remembers, he came there with <HI>Ury the Priest, who swore him into the Plot, with several Negroes,</HI> in particular, <HI>Caesar,</HI> Vaarck's; Comfort's <HI>Jack, Prince,</HI> Auboyneau's; <HI>Quack,</HI> Wal∣ter's; <HI>Cuffee,</HI> Philipse's; <HI>Peggy, and the Examinant herself▪ and her Father and Mother: That all this was done the last Winter, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he thinks before Christmass.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="150" REF="005413_0158_10173B1B61325E08"/>
4. That she saw him the said <HI>Ury, baptize</HI> the above-named Negroes or some of them, <HI>and told them he made them Christians, and forgave them all their Sins, and all the Sins they should commit about the Plot; and preach'd to the Negroes:</HI> Kane <HI>being there also.</HI></P>

<P N="6">6. That <HI>Ury</HI> afterwards told the Examinant that she must confess what Sins she had been guilty of, to him, and he would forgive her them; That she told him that she had been guilty of no other Sins but Cursing and Swearing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Passion; upon which he told her, <HI>as she had taken the Oath to be concerned in the Plot,</HI> he pardoned her her Sins; she replied, that she did not believe any B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> could forgive her her Sins but God; and he said, <HI>Yes, he and all Priests could, if the People did but do what the Priests bid them,</HI> and followed their Directions. <HI>That</HI> Peggy <HI>used to confess in private to</HI> Ury; and she heard him tell her, if she would confess all the Wickedness she had done in the World, he would forgive her, and par∣ticularly about the Plot: And she says that <HI>Peggy</HI> has often told her she was a strong Papist.</P>

<HEAD>DEPOSITION, Taken before One of the Judges.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>JOSEPH WEB,</HI> of the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> Carpenter and House Joiner, being duly sworn, deposed, <Q REND="margQuotes">That some Time last Fall, about the latter End of <HI>October</HI> or Beginning of <HI>November,</HI> to the best of his Remembrance, he was at Work at <HI>John Croker</HI>'s at the Fighting Cocks, and there became acquainted with <HI>John Ury;</HI> and hearing him read Latin and English to some People in the House, and thinking that he read very well, he enquired of <HI>Croker</HI> who he was; and he informed him, he was a <HI>School-Master</HI> lately come from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and taught his Children to read: That after this, he became acquainted with the said <HI>Ury,</HI> and asked him if he would teach a Child of his? And he said he would, if <HI>Croker</HI> would give him the Liberty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coming to his House; and <HI>Croker</HI> agreed to it; and he sent his Child to him,</Q></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="2">2. That afterwards, this Deponent, and <HI>Ury</HI> growing more intimate, and Deponent observing a poor and mean Appearance in his Cloathing, he thought his Pocket answerable thereto, and gave him an Invitation to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House, and told him he should be welcome to his Table Noon and Night at any Time, when he saw proper; and <HI>Ury</HI> accordingly came to this Deponent's House frequently, all the Winter afterwards; and in their Con∣versations he understood by the said <HI>Ury,</HI> that he protest himself a <HI>Nonjuring Minister;</HI> and that he had been taken into Custody in <HI>London,</HI> for a Book that he wrote and printed, that some Criticks picked a Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in it, and construed is Treason, which was contrary to his Intent and Meaning; but by Means of some Friend (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Great Man) who knew his Family very w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, and had a Regard for him, he had his Liberty, and got away: And that by leaving <HI>England,</HI> he lost a Living, (as the Deponent understood him) Church Preferment, of 50 £. a Year Income.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Ury</HI> told the Deponent in some of their Conversation, that in the Time of the late King WILLIAM the Third, the said King offered to a certain Bishop (whose Name he does not now remember) a Bishoprick of about Nine Thousand Pounds a Year, if he would take the Oaths; but that the said Bishop refu∣sed to comply therewith; or that the said Bishop was in Possession of that Preferment, and was ousted, upon refusing to take the Oaths; or the said <HI>Ury</HI> expressed himself to one or other of those Purposes; and the Depo∣nent asked him the said <HI>Ury,</HI> how they did then, when that Bishop was dead? Why said <HI>Ury</HI> they take it by Seniority in a regular Succession: And <HI>Ury</HI> declared, that he himself was ordained by a Bishop, who took his Bishoprick by Seniority and regular Succession, or ex∣pressed himself to that Purpose, as the Deponent under∣stood him,</P>
<P N="4">4. That <HI>Ury</HI> in some of his Conversations with him upon Religious Topicks, <HI>expressed himself in such a dark, obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re and mysterious Manner, that the Deponent could not understand him; he would give Hints that he could make neither Head nor Tall of.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That some Time in <HI>May</HI> last, since the said <HI>Ury</HI> went to live at <HI>Campbell</HI>'s, in the House where <HI>Hughson</HI> lived, the said <HI>Ury</HI> asked the Deponent, whether he knew of any Confectioner? And the Deponent carried him to Mr. <HI>De Brosse</HI>'s; and when he came there, he asked <HI>De Brosse</HI> to shew him some Confectionary; and <HI>Ury</HI> likewise asked <HI>De Brosse,</HI> whether the Lutheran Minister had his Wafers of him? And <HI>De Brosse</HI> said no, he had not them of him: That <HI>De Brosse</HI> shewed <HI>Ury</HI> Confectionary in different Shapes (that is to say) some Lyons, some Dogs, and Cocks (as Deponent thinks) but <HI>Ury</HI> said they would not suit him, and so went away.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="153" REF="005413_0161_10173B23CDF5B330"/>
6. That one Day the Conver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> between <HI>Ury</HI> and Deponent was about Negroes; Deponent having said they had Souls to be saved or lost as well as other People: <HI>Ury said, they were not proper Objects of Salvation;</HI> De∣ponent replied, What would you do with them then; <HI>What would you damn them all?</HI> No says <HI>Ury,</HI> leave them to that Great Being that has made them, he knows best what to do with them; says <HI>Ury,</HI> they are of a slavish Nature▪ it is the Nature of them to be Slaves, give them Learning, do all the Good you can, and put them above the Condition of Slaves, <HI>and in return they will cut your Throats.</HI><NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Ury <HI>seemed to be well acquainted with the Disposition of them.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="7">7. That after <HI>Campbell</HI> removed to <HI>Hughson</HI>'s House, <HI>Ury</HI> removed thither about a Week or ten Days after him; and the Deponent went thither three Times, and heard him read Prayers, in the Manner of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but in the Prayers for the <HI>King,</HI> he only mentioned our Sovereign Lord the King, and not KING GEORGE: The Drift of his first Sermon was against Drunkenness and Debauchery of Life, and against <HI>Deists.</HI> The first Part of his second Sermon was much to the same Pur∣pose with the former, and the latter Part was an Admo∣nition to every one to keep to their own Minister; they that were of the Church of England, to the <HI>English</HI> Minister, those that were of the Lutheran Persuasion to keep to that, and those of the Presbyterians to keep to their Ministers, and not to have <HI>itching Ears</HI> to run after every <HI>New Minister:</HI> That he did not propose to set up a Society for Preaching to them; that he only gave a Word of Admonition at the Request of the Family where he was.</P>

That at his third Sermon, Mr. <HI>Hildreth</HI> was pre∣sent; and <HI>Ury</HI> therein took Notice of two Ministers that had lately preach'd in this City, whose Doctrine he con∣demned; The Particulars that the Deponent remembers he took Notice of, were their Preaching up, that Faith without Works were sufficient for Salvation; he said that this destroyed two grand Attributes of God Almighty, his Justice, and Mercy; (as he thinks) and insisted that there must be good Works: This was the Sunday before the King's Proclamation Day; and at the Close he warned the Persons present; that on the King's Pro∣clamation Day, at five of the Clock in the Evening, he intended to preach upon the following Words, among others: <HI>Upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it,</HI> (concerning St. Peter) and these other Words, <HI>Whosoever Sins ye remit, they are remitted, and whosoever Sins ye retain, they are retained.</HI> This is to the best of Deponent's Remem∣brance; but Deponent has not heard that he preached according to that Warning.</P>

<P>The Judges of the Supreme Court having for some Time past, had under Consideration the Case of <HI>Sarah Hughson,</HI> Daughter of <HI>John Hughson</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI> his Wife, all lately convicted as Accomplices in the Conspiracy; the Circum∣stances of her Misfortune, of having been trained up under the Influence and evil Example of such wicked disposed Parents, bore great Weight with them; they were there∣fore inclinable (if she could be prevailed upon to give some Colour for it) to recommend her to his Honour the Lieu∣tenant Governor as an Object of Mercy; and in this Ex∣pectation, her Executi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (which by order of the Court was proposed to have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same Time with her Father and Mother) had been from time to time respited; but, after <HI>their</HI> Execution, she remained for some time very obstinate; and tho' there was great Reason to expect that it was in her Power to give a further Insight into this Scene of Iniquity; yet she remained inflexible after several Exa∣minations, and would discover nothing; till at length, they were under a Necessity of calling her up to Sentence, and appointing a Day for her Execution, proposing this as the last Experiment to bring her to a Confession, which happened to have the intended Effect; and if there could be any Dependance upon her Veracity in what she had declared (and that she has discovered some Truths not before brought to light, they judged from the Nature of the Conspiracy, so far as it has been unfolded) and if she could be affected with a Sense of Gratitude for saving her Life upon so small Merit, and kept to her History concerning <HI>John Ury</HI> then in Custody, and soon to be tried as an Accomplice in the Plot, and also as a Roman Catholick Priest, they thought she would be a very material Evidence against him; On these Considerations they thought fit this Day to recommend her to his Honour for a Pardon, as an Object of Mercy.</P>

<PB N="156" REF="005413_0164_10173B2CD6E10A58"/>
aforesaid then and there wickedly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did set on fire, and burn, and wholly consume, and destroy, against the Peace of our said Sovereign Lord the KING. His Crown and Dignity: And that <HI>John Ury</HI> alias <HI>Jury, private School-Master,</HI> on the <HI>Twenty-second</HI> Day of <HI>February,</HI> in the said <HI>Fourteenth</HI> Year of the Reign of our said Lord the King, and diverse other Days and Times before the Felony and Burning aforesaid, in Form aforesaid, done and perpetrated at the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> of his Malice afore-thought, wickedly, maliciously, voluntarily, wil∣fully and feloniously did counsel, abet, procure and en∣courage the aforesaid Negro Man Slave called <HI>Quack,</HI> the Felony and Burning aforesaid, in Form aforesaid com∣mitted and perpetrated, to commit and perpetrate, in most pernicious Example of all others in the like Case offending, contrary to the Form of the Statutes in such Case made and provided, and against the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity.</P>
<P>Upon this Indictment he has been arraigned, and hath pleaded thereunto, <HI>Not Guilty;</HI> and for his Trial has put himself upon God and his Country; which Country you are.</P>
<P>YOUR CHARGE is to enquire, Whether he be Guilty of the Felony whereof he stands indicted, or not Guilty.

<P>The Attorney General RICHARD BRADLEY, <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> addressing himself to the Court and Jury, opened the Indictment; and proceeded as followeth.</P>
<Q><P>IN order to maintain the Charge against the Prisoner, upon this Indictment, we shall produce to you the following Evidence, <HI>to wit.</HI></P>
<P>That the Prisoner was actually concerned in the Plot to burn the King's House, and this City, and murder the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>That he has frequently been at <HI>Hughson</HI>'s House, in Company with <HI>Hughson,</HI> his Wife, and Daughter, and <HI>Kerry,</HI> and with divers Negroes, talking with them about the Plot, and counselling and encouraging them to burn the King's House, and the Town, and to kill and destroy the Inhabitants.—That the Negro <HI>Quack,</HI> who burnt the King's House, was present at one or more of those Times, when the Prisoner counselled and encouraged the Negroes as aforesaid.—That he advised them what would be the fittest Time to set the <HI>English</HI> Church on fire; and that the Prisoner, as a <HI>Popish</HI> Priest, baptized <HI>Hughson,</HI> his Wife, and Daughter, and <HI>Kerry,</HI> and also diverse Negroes, and told them then, and at several other Times, <HI>That he could forgive Sins, and that he forgave them their Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relating to the Plot.</HI></P>
<P>That when he was with the Negroes at <HI>Hughson</HI>'s House, he used to make a round Ring on the Floor with Chalk, or some other Thing, and stand in the Middle of it <HI>with a Cross in his Hand, and swear the Negroes into the Plot; and that they should not discover either the Plot, or him, or any other Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ncerned in it,</HI> THOUGH THEY WERE TO DIE FOR IT</P>
<P>That some time last Winter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (at <HI>Hughson</HI>'s House) <HI>swore</HI> Hughson, his Wife, and Daughter, and <HI>Kerry,</HI> and several Negroes <HI>into the Plot.</HI></P>
<P>That he went by several Names; and that when he baptized the Negroes, or any of the Conspirators, he used to tell them, <HI>he forgave them all the Sins they should commit</HI> ABOUT THE PLOT.</P>
<P>We shall likewise produce to you a Letter from General <HI>Oglethorpe</HI> to his Honour our Governor, whereby it appears, <HI>That some time before the Plot broke out here, the</HI> Spaniards <HI>had employed Emissaries to burn all the Ma∣gazines and considerable Towns in the</HI> English North-America: <HI>And that many</HI> PRIESTS <HI>were employed, under pretended Appellations of</HI> PHYSICIANS, DANCING-MASTERS, <HI>and such like Occupations; and under such Pretences to get Admittance into, and Confidence in, Families.</HI></P>
<P>This, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> was their hellish Device to set on foot and carry on the late dreadful Conspiracy among us; and the Prisoner, in Conjunction with <HI>Hughson (as we now have Reason to believe)</HI> drew in the rest of the Conspirators.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> What I have alledged, and much more, you will hear fully proved against the Prisoner by the Witnesses for the King, on this Trial▪ But before we enter upon their Examination, give me Leave to say a few Words concerning the Hainousness of this Prisoner's Offences, and of the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion in general; which I shall speak but very briefly to, as there are several other Gentlemen of Council for the King on this Trial, and as I have not had either Health or Leisure to prepare to say much on this Occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="005413_0165_10173B34166B4DB8"/>
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> The late dreadful Conspiracy to burn the King's House, and this whole Town, and to kill and de∣stroy the Inhabitants, which <HI>the Prisoner,</HI> as well as <HI>Hughson</HI> advised and encouraged, and <HI>swore</HI> many of the Conspirators to join and bear their Parts in, are Crimes of too black and inhumane a Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o need any Aggra∣vation; and, no doubt, the Prisoner's engaging, at the Peril of his own Life, in so destructive, so bloody and dangerous an Enterprize, proceeded from his being em∣ployed in it <HI>by other Popish Priests and Emissaries,</HI> and his Zeal for that murderous Religion: For the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion is such, that they hold it not only lawful but meritorious to kill and destroy all that differ in Opinion from them, if it may any ways serve the Interest of their detestable Religion; the whole Scheme of which seems to be a restless Endeavour to extirpate all other Religions what∣soever, but more especially the Protestant Religion, which they maliciously call the <HI>Northern Heresy:</HI> And to attain this wicked End, their first Trick is, by subtle Arguments to persuade the Laity out of their Senses, by shew it? them a seeming Necessity for their believing as their Church believes, if they tender their own Salvation; and this, with many more Frauds, the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has artfully devised to get an absolute Dominion over the Consciences, that they may the more easily pick the Pockets of credulous People: <HI>Witness</HI> the pretended Par∣dons and Indulgencies of that crafty and deceitful Church, and their Masses to pray Souls out of Purgatory, which they quote (or rather wrest) Scripture for, when no such Thing is to be found there, but is a meer Invention and Cheat of their own to gull the Laity of their Money.</P>
<P>Then they have their Doctrine of Transubstantiation, which is so big with Absurdities that 'tis shocking to the common Sense and Reason of Mankind; for were that Doctrine true, their Priests, by a few Words of their Mouths, can make a God as often as they please; but then they eat him too; and this they have the Impudence to call honouring and adoring of him.—<HI>Blasphemous Wretches!</HI> For hereby they endeavour to exalt themselves above God himself, inasmuch as the Creator must necessa∣rily be greater than his Creature.</P>
<P>These and many other juggling Tricks they have in their <HI>Hocus Pocus,</HI> bloody Religion; which have been strip'd of all their wretched Disguise, and fully exposed in their own Colours by many eminent Divines, but more particularly by the great Dr. <HI>Tillotson,</HI> whose extraordinary Endowment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Mind, his inimitable Works, and ex∣emplary Piety and Charity have gained him such universal Esteem and Applause throughout all the Protestant World, as, no doubt, will endure as long as the Protestant Name and Religion lasts, which I hope will be to the End of Time.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>When you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eard the Witnesses prove to you what I have alledged against the Prisoner, I make no Doubt but you will, for your Oath's Sake, and for your own Country's Peace and future Safety, find him <HI>Guilty.</HI></P></Q>

<P><Q>Why, I have seen <HI>Ury</HI> very often at <HI>Hughson</HI>'s, about Christmass and New-Year, and then he staid away about a Fortnight or three Weeks, and re∣turned again about the Time that <HI>Hogg</HI>'s Goods came to our House.

<P><Q>I know the Prisoner very well, I have seen him at <HI>Croker</HI>'s, at <HI>Coffins,</HI> and <HI>Hughso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s; and par∣ticularly with <HI>Daniel Fagen, Jerry Corker, and one Plum∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, and several Negroes, at Hughson</HI>'s. <HI>Jerry Corker</HI> was one of the First that brought me into the Plot. One Day before Christmass last, I was standing Sentry at the Governor's Door, and <HI>Jerry Corker</HI> coming out, I being dry, asked him for Beer; <HI>Jerry</HI> said he would get some; that he had Rum in his Pocket, and would make Flip; and then he went in and made it in a Copper Pot, and told me it was with Loaf S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gar; I drank a Draught of it; and when I was relieved at Night, <HI>Corker</HI> came into the Guard Room, and asked me if I would go to <HI>Croker</HI>'s at the Fighting Cocks, where there was to be a <HI>Christening by a Romish Priest;</HI> we went thi∣ther, and staid till past Ten o'Clock, but the People did not come that Night: The next Night, <HI>Corker</HI> and I went there again, but the People were not there: The <HI>third Night we went to New-Street, to the House of one</HI> Coffin <HI>a Pedlar;</HI> there they had a Child, and <HI>Ury christened</HI> it, and read Latin; three acted as Priests, and handed the Book about; Ury <HI>put Salt in the Child's Mouth, sprinkled it thrice, and crossed it.</HI> That <HI>Ury</HI> and <HI>Corker</HI> there endeavoured to persuade me to be a Roman Catholick; <HI>Ury</HI> said, <HI>'Twas best to be a Roman, they could forgive Sins for any Thing ever so bad;</HI> I told him, I did not believe him; and <HI>Corker</HI> told me that <HI>Ury</HI> and <HI>all Priests</HI> could forgive Sins. That <HI>Ury</HI> was present at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, when <HI>John Hughson</HI> swore me and his <HI>Father and Brothers</HI> into the Plot; there was <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Forty</HI> or <HI>Fifty Negroes there</HI> at the same Time; we were to burn the Town, and destroy the People. <HI>David Johnson</HI> was there, and <HI>Ury</HI> tipped him on the Shoulder, and they went into a Room together, and staid a Quarter of an Hour; and when they came back, <HI>Johnson</HI> said,

<HI>D—n me, but we will burn the Dutc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and get their Money;</HI> That by <HI>Ury</HI>'s Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wasions <HI>that he could forgive Sins, many were brought in to be concerned; Ury</HI> was near me when I was sworn, and the <HI>Hughsons,</HI> and <HI>I took him to be one of the Head; Ury</HI> wante<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to christen me, but I would not, and he would not speak to me, nor before me, for a long Time; for he could not abide me, <HI>because I refused to become a Roman;</HI> till after he knew that I was concerned in the Plot, and even then he did not much care for me: <HI>Ury</HI> was by, when <HI>Hughson</HI> swore eight Negroes into the Plot <HI>in a Ring;</HI> and it was then talked among them, of burning the Fort; and <HI>Quack</HI> (who was pre∣sent) was at that Time pitched upon to do it, in the Pre∣sence <HI>of Ury,</HI> who he believed might, and did hear it. <HI>Jerry Corker</HI> told me, that the English Church was intended to be burnt on Christmass Day last; but <HI>Ury</HI> put it off, and said, that when the Weather was better, <HI>then there would be a fuller Congregation.</HI></Q></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A PARTY of our <HI>Indians</HI> returned the 8th Instant from War against the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> They had an Engagement with a Party of <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse, just by <HI>Augustine,</HI> and brought one of them Prisoner to me; He gives me an Account of three <HI>Spanish</HI> Sloops, and a Snow, Privateers, who are sailed from <HI>Augustine</HI> to the Northward, for the Provision▪Vessels, bound from the Northward to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> hoping thereby to supply themselves with Flour, of which they are in Want. Besides this Account which he gave to me, he men∣tioned many Particulars in his Examination before our Magistrates.</P>
<P>Some Intelligence I had of a villainous Design of a very extraordinary Nature, and, if true, very important, <ABBR><HI>viz▪</HI></ABBR> That the <HI>Spaniard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> had imployed Emissaries <HI>to burn all the Magazines and considerable Towns in the</HI> English North-America, <HI>thereby to prevent the Subsisting of the great Expedition and Fleet in the</HI> West-Indies: And that for this Purpose, many <HI>Priests</HI> were employed, who pretended to be <HI>Physicians, Dancing-Masters, and other such Kinds of Occupations; and under that Pretence to get Admittance and Confidence in Families.</HI> As I could not give Credit to these Advices, since the Thing was too horrid for any Prince to order, I asked him concerning them; but he would not own he knew any thing of them.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>What would make one give yet more Heed to this Piece of Intelligence, is, a Paragraph in the <HI>American</HI> News-Papers, the Winter before this Conspiracy broke out, ex∣tracted from those of <HI>London,</HI> viz. In the <HI>Boston</HI> Gazette, 1st <HI>December South-Carolina</HI> Gazette, 25th <HI>December,</HI> and the <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> Gazette 1st of <HI>January,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> last of which has it as taken from the <HI>London</HI> Papers of the 7th of <HI>October</HI> 1740.</P>
<P>In order for the Reader to make the most he can of it, 'tis thought proper also to insert the Introduction to it; the Whole is said to be <HI>an Extract of a Letter from the Hague,</HI> as followeth;</P>
<Q><P>THE Marquis <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nelon,</HI> Ambassador from <HI>France,</HI> continues to exhort the States General to make a common Cause with his Court for maintaining the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> in regard to the Possessions of his Catholick Majesty in <HI>America;</HI> and for this Purpose that their High Mightinesses would join a Squadron with those of his Most Christian Majesty, in order to prevent the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmerce in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> from bring interrupted by any Power whatsoever: The Deputies of their High Mightinesses manifested their Surprize at the Proposition of this Ambassador, and told him, that it was not by the <HI>English</HI> that their Merchants, who traffick to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> had in the least suffered; but that it was the continual Vexa∣tions and injurious Treatment they had met with from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they had only Cause to complain of; and their High Mightinesses had caused Representations to be made upon this Subject at the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> and had reiterated their Instances, but all in vain; wherefore their High Mightinesses had found it very necessary to grant the Protection to their Subjects, and to maintain the Liberty of Commerce, which Treaties concluded in the most solemn Manner, had priviledged them to do.</P>
<P><HI>The States General look with a watchful Eye upon the Designs of the Court of</HI> France, <HI>which are, as it is positively assured, to turn the Tables upon the</HI> English <HI>in</HI> America, by exciting Revolts and Disturbances in their Possessions, <HI>and by doing every Thing in it's Power to traverse the Designs, and</HI> even<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the</HI> Boston <HI>Paper it is ever to distress, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>to distress the</HI> English.</P></Q>
<P>The Letter Writer best knew what Assurances there were concerning this Matter; surely these Pieces of Intel∣ligence could not arise from Nothing; whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever there is <HI>much Smoke,</HI> 'tis a necessary Conclusion that there must be <HI>some Fire.</HI></P>
<P>About the Time, or soon after, we had the several Fires in this City, as related in the Introduction, one <HI>Luke Barrington,</HI> an <HI>Irishman,</HI> a profest Papist (who came to live in the County of <HI>Ulster</HI> some short Time before, and set up for a School-master, and kept School at <HI>Little Britain</HI>) being in Company with <HI>James Mc Claghry, Peter Mullender</HI> and several others; <HI>Mullender</HI> drank KING GEORGE's Health to <HI>Barrington,</HI> who taking the Bason of Liquor into his Hand, drank <HI>King Philip</HI>'s, or <HI>Philip of Spain</HI>'s Health▪ <HI>Mc Claghry</HI> thereupon told <HI>Barrington,</HI> it was wrong in him to drink the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Health in that Company, especially as it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> War with <HI>Spain,</HI> and if any would inform against him, he might be hanged on that Tree, pointing to a Tree near by; to which <HI>Barrington</HI> replied, he scorned to dissemble for any Body; that <HI>King Philip</HI> was <HI>his King;</HI> and if he would come over with his Army, he would take up Arms for him, and knock all the <HI>English</HI> on the Head: <HI>Barrington</HI> staid a Day and two Nights afterwards in that Neighbourhood, and then left it:
<PB N="162" REF="005413_0170_10173B46C7F51048"/>
Of this <HI>Mc Claghry</HI> afterwards made Oath before one of his Majesty's Council for this Province, living near that Neighbourhood, who caused diligent Enquiry to be made after <HI>Barrington,</HI> in order to apprehend him; but he was not met with at that Time; though it was said, he was taken up some time afterwards, and committed to <HI>Kingston</HI> Jail, and from thence made escape.</P>
<P>It seems this School-master came first into those Parts the Fall before; he was a young Man about Five and Twenty; he pretended to be a Minister's Son of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in <HI>Ireland;</HI> knew many of the <HI>Irish</HI> Gentry, and could give an Account of their Families; he said he left his Father in a Pet; had travelled into <HI>Italy,</HI> and confessed to some, that he turned Roman Catholick there: And as the Neighbourhood talked much of his being an extraordinary Scholar, and of his understanding several Languages, the Counsellor several Times sent him an Invitation to his House; but he never went, nor did that Gentleman ever see him.—But it was said, that some time after his Arrival there, he chiefly kept Company with the <HI>Irish</HI> Servants, of which they have many in that Part of the Country, and the greatest Number of them Roman Catholicks, and they had frequent Meetings together.</P>
<P>So that this is a fourth Instance of <HI>suspicious Schoolmasters</HI> infesting these Parts, correspondent to General <HI>Oglethorpe</HI>'s Letter of Advice: This Man, <HI>Ury</HI> the Priest, <HI>Holt</HI> a Dancing-Master, and <HI>John Corry</HI> an <HI>Irishman,</HI> a Dancing-Master and profest Papist.</P>

<P><Q>IT is very incongruous to Reason to think that I can have any Hand or be any way concerned in this Plot if these Things be duly weighed: That after the Dis∣covery of the Conspiracy and the Execution of many for it that I should act such a Lunatick part if I were Guilty as to continue in this City join with Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> and not only so but publickly advertise myself for teaching of Grammer<NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot"><HI>There was no name to his Advertisement, as has been remarked.</HI></NOTE> yea further that I should still continue even after the Caution Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> gave me a Week and a few Days before I was taken into Custody he told me Mr. <HI>Chambers</HI> told him that the Eyes of this City were fixed on me, and that I was suspected to be a Roman Priest and thought to be in the Plot I answered my Inno∣cency would protect me I valued not what the World said, again another Instance that must free me from this Plot is when Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> went to take Possession of <HI>Huson</HI>'s House his Daughter refusing to go out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd she swearing like a Life Guardman I took up the Cause Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> not exerting himself as I thought was proper at that time and told her if she would not go out quietly I would take another Method with her for I would have no such wicked Person (as she was said to be) live where I was to dwell Now Reason must pronounce me innocent for had I been engaged in their Scheme my Guilt my Fears would have forced me to have acted in a very different manner rather to have soothed her and gave her Liberty to stay till provided for instead of not shewing her the least Countenance and further what corroberates my Non knowledge of this Plot is that the Negro who confessed as it is said that he set fire to the Fort did not mention me in all his Confession doubtless he would not have neglected and passed over such a Person as I am said to be namely a Priest and if he was bound by any Oath or Oaths as he confest it shewed he thought it or them of no Value and therefore would have confessed and laid open the whole Scheme and all the Persons he knew concerned in it but more especially the Priest as it is said I am and what is still more strong for my Innocency is that neither <HI>Huson</HI> his Wife nor the Creature that was hanged with them and all that have been put to Death since did not once name me certainly Gentlemen if I am a Priest as you take me to be I could not be so foolish as to engage myself in so absurd a Con∣trivance as to bind myself with a Cord for Negroes or what is worse profligate Whites the Scum of this Earth superior in Villany to the Knights of the Post to make an Halter for me Gentlemen as there is a great unknown and tremendous Being whom we call God I never knew or saw <HI>Huson</HI> his Wife or <HI>the Creature</HI> that was hanged with them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o my Knowledge living dying or dead or the Negro that is said to have fired the Fort excepting in his last Moments but put the Case I had known <HI>Huson</HI>'s and had been at his House Is it to be inferred from thence that I must be acquainted with his Villainy or kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w his Secrets and as he kept a Publick House which is open and free for all is it reasonable to think that all or any Man being seen at <HI>Huson</HI>'s must make him or them cul∣pable or chargeable with his Villany surely no for if so sad would be the Case of many Gentlemen who in tra∣velling the Countries in <HI>England</HI> who have used bad Houses or Inns and lit into the Company of Highway∣men

who by their Garb and Conversation they took for some honest Country Gentleman or Tradesman and yet these have not been in the least suspected But I fear all this Trouble of mine springs from and is grounded upon <HI>the Apprehensions of my being a Roman Priest</HI> and therefore must be a Plotter some believing there can be no Mischief in a Country but a Priest (if there) must be in it Say they that in the Chain of general Woes the first and the last Link must be tied to the Priest's Girdle. But Gentlemen I must assure you from Reading and Conversation I believe no Priest would hold a Confederacy with Negroes they are too wise too cunning to trust such sort of Gentry It is not Men of Fortune good Sense and Learning they care to meddle with or entrust in such Affairs as Plots excepting they be Men of their own Kidney of their own way of thinking in Religion supposing a Priest could be so foolish or become so non compos mentes as to Plot in short a Priest a joint Contriver of firing a Fort a Celebrater of Masses a Dispenser of Absolutions as it is said I am so long passed by such a particular Person forgotten▪ No Gentlemen you must think and believe he would have been the next Person after the Discovery of the Plot that would have been brought on the Carpet And further what is of great Note is that <HI>Huson</HI> was sworn to be the whole Projector and Carrier on of the Plot and if these Witnesses knew me so well as they pretend to how came it about what Reason can be assigned why they did not bring me out before what not know any Thing of me before I came to Prison, doubtless they would have been eager to have betrayed me when the Scheme was disco∣vered, For being a Priest and consequently artful and cunning they would have been afraid of my escaping No if I had been engaged they would have soon in∣formed thinking to have saved their own Lives knowing how this Government stands affected to such Gentlemen, And as to the second Indictment wherein.........</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>Webb▪</SPEAKER>
<P>I have known Mr. <HI>Ury</HI> since <HI>November</HI> last, I was then at work at <HI>John Croker'</HI>s at the Fighting Cocks, and hearing him reading Latin and English, and thinking he read well, enquired of <HI>Croker</HI> who he was? he told me he was a <HI>Schoolmaster</HI> lately come from <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and from this I became acquainted with him, and I asked him if he would teach a Child of mine; and he said he would, if <HI>Croker</HI> would give him Liberty of coming to his House; which <HI>Croker</HI> agreed to; and I s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt my Child to him, and he taught him Latin▪ and after this I recommended him to Col. <HI>Beekman,</HI> to teach his Daughter to write and cypher; and he and I growing more intimate, and I observing a poor and mean Appearance in his Habit, I thought his Pocket might be answerable to it; and I gave him an Invitation to my House, and told him he should be welcome at my Table Noon and Night, at any time, when he saw proper; and he frequently came to my House accordingly all the Winter after: That he used often to stay at my House late in discoursing, sometimes on one Subject, sometimes on another; and has staid there, now and then, till Eleven or Twelve o'Clock at Night, and I have often gone home with him to his Lodging at those Hours. Mr. <HI>Ury</HI> told me he was a Non Juring Minister; having asked him, who ordained him, he answered me, the Senior Non Juror in <HI>England:</HI> I have heard him preach, and have heard him say, such a Day is my Sacrament Day, and he must be at Sacrament.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Webb.</SPEAKER>
<P>He asked me for a Confectioner's Shop, and I shewed him Mr. <HI>De Brosse'</HI>s▪ where he went along with me; and after he asked for several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts of Sweet Meats, he asked for Wafers; which being shewn to him, he asked Mr. <HI>De Brosse</HI> if he made Wafers for the Lutheran Minister, and he was told he did, but I do not remember that he bought any of them: I have heard him pray and preach several times, but don't remember, <HI>That ever I heard him pray for King</HI> GEORGE, <HI>but in general Terms for the King.</HI> I am by Trade a Carpenter, and <HI>Ury</HI> applied to me to make him up something in <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House, which I have heard since called an Altar; That <HI>Ury</HI> gave me Directions for making it, and said, it was a Place to lay Books on to read, or to put a Candle or a Bottle and Glass on, or other such like common Uses; it was two Pieces of Board, which formed a Triangle, and was raised against the Wall, at the Bottom of which was a Shelf; on each Side there was a Place to hold a Candle.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hildreth.</SPEAKER>
<Q><P>The Way I came to hear of, or know this Mr. <HI>Ury,</HI> was, that last Winter some time in <HI>February,</HI> I happened to be in Company with a Friend at Mr. <HI>Croker'</HI>s, and Mr. <HI>Webb,</HI> Joiner, called me aside, and asked me What School I had; and if I would incline to take a Partner, one very well versed in the <HI>English, Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Tongues? I answered him, what School I had I could very well manage myself; I had no Inclination for a Partner at all: He said he was a good sober sort of a Man, and understood his Business very well, and if we could agree, he did not doubt but it would do very well: I answered him, I inclined to be Master of my own School alone, though it was not so large as if I had a Partner▪ He seeing I had no Inclination for him, did not tell me who he was.</P>
<P>Some time after, about seven or eight Weeks, I had a little Business on board Capt. <HI>Griffiths,</HI> where I met with him and <HI>Web</HI> in Company, which was the first time I ever spoke to him; then, after our Salutation of each other, he began to ask me some Questions concerning my School and Method of teaching; after which we stepped in at <HI>Baker'</HI>s, and took a serious Glass together; at which time he took a small Book out of his Pocket (<HI>English</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI>) and construed (I think) the 117th Psalm; then laying the Book on the Table, I took it up, and was going to look on the Title Page; but he directly seized it out of my Hands, and told me I must not look into it, and put it in his Pocket.</P>
<P>Another time at my School, I had some Discourse with him concerning Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Letter in Answer to Mr. <HI>Wesly'</HI>s Sermon on Free-Grace; which Letter he did not approve of at all, and told me, he believed it was <HI>through the great Encouragement the Negroes had received from Mr.</HI> Whitefield, <HI>we had all this Disturbance; and that he believed Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>was more of a</HI> Roman <HI>than any Thing else; and he believed he came abroad with no good Design.</HI> Then I asked him what was the Signification of a Non-Juror, as I understood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pretended to be? and he answered, those that would not take the Oaths of Allegiance, as he did not: I asked him Why? Says he, Can you swear one to be a Bastard? <HI>No:</HI> No more can they say King <HI>J</HI>—was one; and the Difference between <HI>we Non-Jurors</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> is this; we in the Prayer for the King and Royal Family, <HI>mention no Names,</HI> as they do; I asked him if they pray'd for the <HI>Pretender?</HI> he said, <HI>for him, let him be who he will, that was the King;</HI> he mentioned no Names.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="005413_0174_10173B556BC15EC8"/>
At another time, says he, you talk so much against Popery, I believe though you speak so much against it, <HI>you will find you have (or I think will have) a Pope in your Belly;</HI> for, says he, the Absolution of the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> is not half so bad as that of the <HI>Church of England</HI> at the Visitation of the Sick: But, says I, I don't approve of their confessing to Priests, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> says I, there is a deal of Wickedness and Deceit in it: Says he, No, no; for when any Person makes Confessions, the Priest does not know who they be; for he does not so much as see them, but only hears and absolves them: Then, says I, I was mistaken. Oh! says he, they speak against the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> but don't know them; their Priests, says he, are the most learned of Men; the Articles of the <HI>Church of England</HI> were made in distracted Times. And I observed several times he said, <HI>we Priests.</HI> Says he, your <HI>Roman Priests</HI> will make you believe, and prove by the plain Rules of Grammar, <HI>that black is white, and white black,</HI> and that the Wafer and Wine is the real Body and Blood of Christ.</P>
<P>We were often in Company; but the best Part of our Discourse was upon Salvation by Faith alone, which he would not allow, nor Predestination; and he told me, he really believed the Moon to be an inhabited Planet, and all the Stars were inhabited; or else, says he, I would not repeat that Part of the <HI>Nicene</HI> Creed, <HI>Begotten of his Father before all Worlds;</HI> and, says he, many Texts of Scripture confirm it to be so.</P>
<P>I was several times since in his Company, but do not remember any Thing in particular relating to Priests, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the last time I had any Thing of Discourse was about two Days before I heard him preach, and then in his Room; I seeing the Altar placed in the Corner, I asked him what Use that was for? first he said only to lay Books on, or for a Candle to sit and read by; but I told him I could not think it; for I supposed it for the Sacrament by its Form and odd Colour; I begged him to let me know what it was; so after some time he seriously told me, it was for the Sacrament; and he told me, I think, every Saint's Day it was exposed, only covered with a Piece of white Linnen; and that he administered on some proper Days; and he told me, they received the Wafer instead of Bread, and white instead of red Wine: I asked, why the Wafer? Because, says he, the Wafer is more pure; and no Bread he thought pure enough to represent the Body of our Lord; then going to his small Box, says he, I'll get a Piece and you shall taste it if you will; and he brought me a Piece, and I took and eat it.</P>
<P>I think he told me, that some time before he had baptized a Child in the House, but they used more Ceremonies than we; and he talked as if they anointed and washed one another's Feet: He told me further, that at the Time of the Celebration, or at what Time the Sacrament was exposed, they had lighted Candles burning to represent our Saviour as the Light of the World. And when I came in to hear him preach, I accordingly saw it as he told me; for he told me before, that if I came on Sunday Evening to hear him, I could see it; for the Sacrament was on the Altar covered with a white Linnen Cloth, and there were three Candles burning; but not a Minute after I came in, he put out the Candles, and put his Sacrament in his Box, and locked them up.</P>
<P>Some time after I became thus acquainted with him, I was informed he kept a private Meeting, and made Use of the Church Form of Prayer every Sunday Evening, at the House of Mr. <HI>John Campbell,</HI> in his own hired Room.</P>
<P>My Curiosity led me the next Sunday Evening to go and hear him preach; but when I came there, he told me he did not make a Practice of Preaching to any others, but those of his own Society; and those of his Society did not make any Practice of running to any of our Churches or Meetings; for he did not approve of any such Thing; and as he was a Non Jured Minister, so he had a Society and Members of his own.</P>
<P>Afterwards he told me, he had some Company from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> (I think) and desired to be excused; but next Sunday Evening, if I would call, he would be glad to see me.</P>
<P>The next Sunday Evening I accordingly went, and heard him discourse upon the Second Chapter of the Second Epistle of <HI>St. Peter,</HI> the 1<HI>st,</HI> 2<HI>d</HI> and 3d Verses; and before he dismissed us, he told us he would preach the next Wednesday following (being the Day his Majesty began his happy Reign) upon the 16th Chapter of <HI>St. Matthew,</HI> the 18<HI>th</HI> and 19<HI>th</HI> Verses, adjoining to them the Words of Our Lord to his Disciples, <HI>Whose soever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver Sins ye retain, they are retained:</HI> Which Dis∣course I did not not hear.</P></Q>

<P>I became acquainted with him last Fall, and I agreed with him in <HI>December</HI> to teach my Children to write and read; That several Times in Conversation with him, he talked in such a Manner that I suspected him to be a Popish Priest He used very often to miss coming to teach my Children at the School time, and made frivolous Excuses; and at last I was very angry with him and dis∣charged him: That in the Evenings he us'd very often to pretend that he must go to pray by a sick Person <HI>by the English Church,</HI> that belonged to his Society, or that he must go and pray with his Society <HI>by the English Church:</HI><NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Hughson'<HI>s was near by it.</HI></NOTE> Whereupon I once asked him to let me go along with him; but he refused me, and said it was not proper for any one to go there, who were not of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Society; which occa∣sioned a Jealousy in me, and I had often a Mind to have dogged him, to have seen where he went, and do not know how it happened, but I never did. That one Day I met <HI>Campbell</HI> the Schoolmaster in the Street, who said to me, What do you think? <HI>Webb</HI> has taken away his Son from me, and has put him to a School-master that lodges at <HI>Croker's;</HI> and <HI>Campbell</HI> said, <HI>D—n him, he is a Popish Priest:</HI> And at last having a bad Opinion of him, I dis∣charged him, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he should inveigle my Children; and I told him, I would have nothing more to say to him.</P>

<P>That the Prisoner is a Romish Emissary, sent according to the Intimation in General <HI>Oglethorpe's</HI> Letter, I think must be concluded from what has been given in Evidence against him; and from the known Principles of the Romish Reli∣gion, it may be judged, what Inducement the Prisoner had to undertake so wicked and diabolical a Project. The Letter of General <HI>Oglethorpe</HI> has been offered by Way of Inducement, and in aid of other Evidence in general, to shew that there was a Plot; and herein I apprehend we are justified by the Precedents and Authorities in Law before cited.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> addressing himself to the Court, proceeded as followeth.</P>
<SP>
<P>Before the Prisoner enters upon his Defence, we conceive it will be proper to read to him some Passages out of sundry Books, that declare the Customs and Usages of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> to which his Practices among us, as declared by the Witnesses, bear some Conformity: And unless he can make it appear, that his Practices are warran∣ted by the Usage of any other Church, we conceive they will convince every Body, that he is a <HI>Priest</HI> of the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> and of no other.</P>
<P>And first, as to the Use of Salt.</P>
<P><HI>Peter de Moulin,</HI> in his Book entitled, <HI>Anatomie de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Messe,</HI> 2 <HI>Part, p.</HI> 94. gives us the Form of the Priests exorcising Salt, in order to prepare it for their superstitious Uses in the following Words; which, because the Prisoner professes himself a Scholar, I shall first read in the Original, and then render it into <HI>English.</HI></P>

<Q><HI>Creature of Salt, I exorcise thee by the living God, by the true God, by the holy God, by the God who commanded thee to be put into the Water by Elisha the Prophet, that the Barrenness of the Water might be healed; that then may'st become Salt exorcised, for the Salvation of them that believe; that thou may'st be to all who take thee Health of Soul and Body; and that from the Place where thou art sprinkled, may fly and depart every Apparition and Wickedness, or Cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tiness of diabolical Fraud, and every unclean Spirit adjured by him who will come to judge the Quick and Dead, and the World by Fire.

<P>As to Popish Use of Salt in Baptism, we have a most authentick Testimony in their Catechism, edited by the Decree of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> in Chapter 9. <HI>De Baptis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sacramento.</HI></P>

<HI>In</HI> English <HI>thus;</HI></P>
<P>Q. 66. <HI>Why is Salt put to the Mouth of the Person that is baptized?</HI></P>
<P>Answer. <Q><HI>There are other Ceremonies added to Exorcism, of which some being mystical, have a proper and remarkable Signification; for when Salt is put into the Mouth of him who is to be brought to Baptism, 'tis clear that this is sig∣nified, that he shall obtain by the Doctrine of Faith and Gift of Grace, a Freedom from the Corruption of his Sins, partake of the Savour of good Works, and be delighted with the Food of Divine Wisdom.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As to the Point of Absolution.</P>
<P>We have the <HI>Jesuits</HI> Doctrine concerning it at large; in a Book, entitled, <HI>Les Provinciales, ou Lettres ecrites par</HI> Louis Montalte, <HI>à un Provincial de ses Aims et au R. R. P. P. Jesuits sur la Morale a la Politique de ces Peres. Tom.</HI> II. <HI>Lettre</HI> X. I shall only cite one or two Passages from this Letter <HI>page</HI> 50. which quotes <HI>Le P. Bauni, q.</HI> 15. in these Words.</P>
<Q><P>On peut absoudre Celui qui avoue, que l'esperance el' etre absous l' a porte a pecher, avec plus de facilitè qu' il n'eut fait, sans cette espe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance.</P>
<P>Et le P. Caussin defendant cette Proposition dit. p 211. de sa Resp. à la Theol. mor. que si elle n' etoit veritable, l' usage de la Confession seroit interdit à la plu'part du monde et qu' il n' y auroit plus de auter remede aux pecheurs qu' une Branche d' arbre et une Corde.</P></Q>
<P><HI>In English thus.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>A Man may be absolv'd, says Father</HI> Bauni, <HI>who confesses that the Hope of Absolution encouraged him to commit Sin with the greater Ease, which he had not done without such Hope. And Father</HI> Caussin <HI>defending this Proposition, says, That if this was not true, the Use of Confession would be forbidden to the greatest Part of the World; and Sinners would have no other Remedy left, but the Limb of a Tree and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Halter.</HI></Q>
<P>This is the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> contrary to that of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who says, <HI>Shall we continue in Sin that Grace may abound? God forbid.</HI></P>
<P>May it please your Honours, This is all that we shall mention at present, that if the Prisoner pleases, he may take Notice of them in his Defence, and shew, if he can, that he had another Warrant than the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> for the like Practices proved by the Witnesses.</P>

<P>[Here the Prisoner read over again that Part of his Speech, which is set forth before, and then proceeded as followeth.]</P>
<P><Q>And as to the second Indictment wherein I stand charged with being an Ecclesiastick Person made by Authority from the <HI>See of Rome</HI> that I have celebrated Masses given Absolutions and that I have acknow∣ledged myself to be a Priest of the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> all which cannot is not proved. As to my professing myself to be an Ecclesiastick of the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> is very improbable if it be considered that no Gentleman who is a Priest would be so childish as to tell any Person out of Communion that he is a Priest there must be as I have been informed very good Proof that a Person is a Roman Catholick before a Priest will have any thing to say to him and that Proof consists in the Persons produ∣cing a regular Certificate from their last Confessor and as to my celebrating of Masses it is very unlikely if it be considered that if the Evidences saw me celebrating of Masses they must have seen more, seeing there can be no Mass without Two at the Altar, and by the Priest's Breviary and Directory for celebrating of High Mass three Priest's two Officials and at some Masses four Officials Twelve a Clock As to Absolution it is well known by the Learned that the Sacrament of Penance must proceed which if the Evidences are asked what it means I believe they can give no Account of It is not Persons professing themselves Roman Catholicks by going to Mass or being brought up in that way that have any thing to say to a Priest And as to those who were not born within the Pale of that Church if not learned that know any thing of her Doctrines or Worship much less to con∣verse with Priests as Priests nay before they can partake of any Privileges of that Church they must be <HI>rebaptized</HI> and inducted Now how come these Persons to know so much, to be acquainted with Priests and their Secrets who know not what Mass is nor what the Difference of a Vesper from a Compline or a Compline from a Nocturn nor the Hours of Mass no more than we <HI>were</HI> Swallows▪ Shelter in the Winter, but by Conjecture; As to my Books and Writings I cannot be deemed a Roman Catholick▪ either a Spiritual Person or Laick I believe it cannot with Reason be concluded that a Person having a Mass Book in Possession must therefore be a Papist If so a Man having the Alcoran must be a Mahometan and a Presbyterian with a Common Prayer must from thence be a Churchman but I believe that will not be allowed by any—The written Book was transcribed from the Secret History of <HI>Europe</HI> and after some Remarks I told

Col. <HI>Beekman</HI> that it was a very insipid thing and that if a Priest wrote it he was a very foolish one But now suppose these Lines are my own Thoughts does that make me Pe∣nable when they were never exposed in Print and therefore cannot be Libellous. I remember in the case of <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI> who was beheaded in King JAMES II. Reign for Writings found in his Closet which were of his own composing and this was thought so wicked and unreason∣able an Action That King WILLIAM and his Parliament took of the Attainder of High Treason and registered it Murder And Gentlemen I believe you cannot be brought to think that such a venerable pious and learned Gen∣tleman as Mr. <HI>Comyns</HI> could make such a Mistake as to take a Roman Priest for a Non-Juring Minister nor yet the Gentleman when he recommended me to—as a Person worthy their Notice and Benevolence which accordingly took Effect for I had my Passage paid and provided for 'till I could get into Business—Gentlemen The Mistake the Major Part of the World lyes under is their apprehending that a Non Juring Priest must be a Popish Priest Whereas there is no truer Protestants for they are far from having any regard to a Pretender or for setting on the Throne a Popish Prince to be the head of a Protestant Church The Doctrines they assert and stand by is Non Resistance and passive Obedience which is now as vigourously maintained as ever it was in any Reign And I believe that there is no Nonjuror either Clergy or Laity but would shew themselves such true Subjects to the present King GEORGE as to take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy I have now no more to say but hope and pray that what has been offered will be considered with Minds unprejudiced Minds prepossessed with no Opinions with Minds in a diligent Search after Truth You being Gentlemen I hope fearing God reve∣rencing Conscience hating Partiality Lovers of Truth and Innocency and having a tender Rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> Life.<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot"><HI>This and the other Part of the Speech, or Defence, delivered by the Prisoner, being taken from his Paper, which he read in Court, from whose Hands it was obtained the next Morning; and it being wrote in the Prisoner's own Hand, without Stops or Pointing, he apologized therefore to the Person he delivered it to; and as there were none in the Original, the Compiler would not risque altering the Sense, by printing it with any: Though it may be remarked, that those who were somewhat acquainted with the Man, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of Opinion, he was not very capable of making them.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Mr. SMITH summ'd up the Evidence for the King, and addressing himself to the Court and Jury, proceeded as followeth.</P>
<Q><P>THO' this Work of Darkness, in the Contrivance of a horrible Plot, to burn and destroy this City▪ has manifested itself in many <HI>blazing Effects,</HI> to the Terror and Amazement of us all; yet the secret Springs of this Mischief lay long concealed: This destructive Scene has opened by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low Degrees: But now, Gentlemen, we have at length great Reason to conclude, that it took its rise from a <HI>Foreign Influence;</HI> and that it originally de∣pended upon Causes, that we ourselves little thought of▪ and which, perhaps, very few of the inferiour and subordinate Agents were intimately acquainted with.</P>
<P>The monstrous Wickedness of this Plot would pro∣bably among Strangers impeach its Credit; but if it be considered as the Contrivance of the <HI>publick Enemy,</HI> and the inhuman Dictate of a <HI>bloody Religion,</HI> the Wonder ceases.</P>
<P>What more cruel and unnatural can be conceived, than what <HI>Rome</HI> has contrived; yea what more savage and barbarous, than what Popery has attempted, and sometimes executed, for the Extirpation of that, which the <HI>Papists</HI> call <HI>Heresy?</HI> We need not go so far from home as the <HI>Vallies of Piedmont,</HI> nor rake into the Ashes of the <HI>Antient Waldanses</HI> and <HI>Albigenses,</HI> for tragical Instances of <HI>Popish Cruelty.</HI>—We need not remind you of the <HI>Masacre</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> nor the later Desolations in <HI>France,</HI> nor mention the <HI>horrible Slaughters</HI> of the <HI>Duke d' Alva</HI> in the <HI>Low Countries;</HI>—We need not recount the many Millions of Lives, that in remote Countries, and different Ages, have been sacrificed to the ROMAN IDOL; nor measure out to you, that <HI>Ocean</HI> of foreign Blood with which the SCARLET WHORE hath made herself perpetually drunk.</P>
<P>No, Gentlemen, the <HI>Histories</HI> of our Native Country will give us a formidable Idea of Popery; and inform us of the detestable Principles of that <HI>Religion:</HI> Witness the Blood of <HI>our own Martyrs</HI> (who perished in Prisons and at the Stake) without beginning higher than my <HI>Lord Cobham,</HI> and recounting their Number down to the End of <HI>Queen Mary'</HI>s Reign.—</P>
<P>—Witness that execrable Design to blow up King, Lords and Commons, in the <HI>Gun Powder Treason,</HI> con∣trived by the <HI>Papists▪</HI> That intestine Fire that broke out in the late unnatural <HI>Civil War,</HI> the Coals whereof were blown up by them.—The bloody <HI>Massacre</HI> of many Thousands of <HI>Protestants</HI> by the <HI>Irish Papists,</HI> about the same Time: The restless Spirit of that Party, which has broke out in Plots in almost every Reign since the Reformation.—The arbitrary and illegal Measures that preceeded the <HI>Glorious Revolution;</HI> and the unnatural Rebellion within our Memory:—These are all Evidences of the destructive Tendency of that <HI>bloody Religion,</HI> which
<PB N="170" REF="005413_0178_10173B6174467628"/>
in order to promote i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Interests, never boggles at the <HI>vilest Means,</HI> can sanctify the most <HI>execrable Villainies;</HI> and to encourage its Votaries, will cannonize for <HI>Saints,</HI> a <HI>Guy Faux</HI> and others, some of the greatest Monsters of Iniquity that ever trod upon the Face of the Earth!</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> If the Evidence you have heard is sufficient to produce a general Conviction, that the late Fires in this City, and the murderous Design against its Inha∣bitants, are the Effects of a <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Popish Plot▪</HI> then the <HI>Mystery</HI> of this <HI>Iniquity,</HI> which has so much puzzled us, is unvailed, and our Admiration ceases: All the Mis∣chiefs we have suffered or been threatned with, are but a <HI>Sprout</HI> from that <HI>Evil Root,</HI> a small <HI>Stream</HI> from that over-flowing <HI>Fountain</HI> of Destruction, that has often de∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g'd the <HI>Earth</HI> with <HI>Slaughter and Blood,</HI> and spread Ruin and Desolation far and wide.</P>
<P>We need not wonder to see a <HI>Popish Priest</HI> at this <HI>Bar,</HI> as a <HI>Prime Incendiary;</HI> nor think it strange that an <HI>Englishman</HI> of that <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> should be concerned in so a Detestable a Design. What can be expected from those that pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess <HI>a Religion,</HI> that is at War with God and Man; not only with the <HI>Truth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> but also with <HI>Common Sense</HI> and <HI>Reason;</HI> and is destructive of all the kind and tender Sensations of Human Nature?—When a Man, contrary to the Evidence of <HI>his Senses,</HI> can believe the absurd Doctrine of Transubstantiation; can <HI>give up his Reason</HI> to a blind Obedience and an implicit Faith; can be persuaded to believe, that the most unnatural Crimes, such as <HI>Treason</HI> and <HI>Murder,</HI> when <HI>done in Obedience to the Pope,</HI> or for the Service of the <HI>Holy Church,</HI> by rooting out what they call <HI>Heresy,</HI> will merit Heaven: I say, when a Man has imbibed such Principles as these, he can easily divest himself of every thing that is Human but his Shape, he is capable of any <HI>Villainy,</HI> even as bad as that which is charged on the <HI>Prisoner</HI> at the <HI>Bar.</HI></P></Q>
<P>[Thence Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> proceeded to observe on the several Parts of the Indictment, that were necessary to be proved, in order to convict the Prisoner; particularly, <HI>That Quack did burn his Majesty's House in the Fort; That the Prisoner did counsel, abet, procure and encourage the said Negro to commit that Felony.</HI> He observed, that the <HI>three Witnesses, Mary Burton, William Kane</HI> and <HI>Sarah Hughson,</HI> had fully prov'd the <HI>Fact.</HI> He reminded the <HI>Jury</HI> of the Caution that the Court had taken in Favour of the Prisoner, so that none of the <HI>three Witnesses</HI> had heard the Testimony, which was given by those which had been examined before them; the Particulars of which Evidence is before-mentioned, and the Observations thereon, are here omitted, for Bravity Sake.]</P>
<P>And then concluded,</P>
<Q><P>Thus, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Nothing remains to be considered but the Credit of the Witnesses. Indeed two of them have been concerned in the Plot; but we have proved them (under their present Circumstances) to be legal Witnesses.—They all give a consistent Account of the Fact; and if you believe their Testimony, we think, you can't avoid finding the <HI>Prisoner Guilty.</HI> You have heard the <HI>Prisoner's Defence;</HI> which, we conceive, does not affect the main Parts of the Accusation: <HI>He tells you that he must have been a Lunatick to have staid in Town after Notice, if he had been guilty:</HI> True; and in some Sense he must be supposed to have been a <HI>Lunatick</HI> from the Time he first concerned himself in this <HI>detestable Plot.</HI> Gentlemen, <HI>all Wickedness</HI> is in some sort <HI>Mad∣ness;</HI> and the Degrees of it rise in Proportion to the <HI>Enormity</HI> of the Crime; and when Men have filled up the Measure of their Iniquity, and are ripe for Ruin, they are commonly cut off from all▪ the Means of escaping it.</P>
<P><HI>As to his rough Language to</HI> Sarah Hughson <HI>at</HI> Camp∣bell'<HI>s, on which he lays some Stress;</HI> this may be accounted for, as proceeding from other Causes than his Innocence; either from a personal Resentment of a supposed Injury to himself, who wanted the Room she took up in that House; or perhaps with a Design to make a Shew that he never had been acquainted with her; for Priests, he tells us, are <HI>very artful and cunning.</HI>—But be this how it will, we conceive it can't amount to a <HI>Disproof</HI> of the main Charge against the <HI>Prisoner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to what he alledges concerning</HI> Quack, Hughson <HI>and</HI> his Wife, <HI>and</HI> the Creature that died with them, <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> having accused him;</HI> we think very little can be inferred from thence in his Favour: As to <HI>Quack,</HI> he accused many in general Terms more than he particularly named; and indeed the Confession that <HI>Quack</HI> made was in the Hurries of Death, after he was fastened to the Stake. <HI>Hughson,</HI> his <HI>Wife,</HI> and <HI>the Creature</HI> that died with them, confessed <HI>Nothing</HI> at all; therefore <HI>Nothing</HI> can be inferred from their not accusing the Prisoner. It seems strange, that Mr. <HI>Ury</HI> could not give us the Name of <HI>that Crea∣ture</HI> that died with <HI>Hughson and his Wife,</HI> seeing as <HI>Mary Burton</HI> says, he was so well acquainted with her as to have had the Liberty of undressing himself in her Bed-Room.</P>
<P><HI>As to the Prisoner's Appeal to God for his Innocence▪ this we conceive witnesses Nothing in his Favour, but rather against him;</HI> for we often find, that the <HI>Wickedest of Men</HI> will attempt to cloak their <HI>Villainies</HI> with the same Practice, and <HI>good Men</HI> are ever sparing in their <HI>Appeals</HI> to <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ven,</HI> even in Cases where their <HI>Innocence</HI> is concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="005413_0179_10173B64B2AE2EA0"/>
<HI>He says, that it don't follow from his being at</HI> Hughson'<HI>s, that he was guilty of the Plot:</HI> True▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> admitting that he had used that House▪ his Pretence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>John Campbell,</HI> of not knowing it, must have been a <HI>Piece of Craft;</HI> and it renders the Evidence of <HI>his being concerned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Wick∣edness carried on there, the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> probable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He says, a Priest is more artful and cunning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Negroes, if so foolish or non compos mentis as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> Gentlemen, this proves nothing in the prisoner's Favour▪ for supposing a <HI>Priest</HI> to be concerned in this Plot, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was <HI>too extensive</HI> for him to execute it alone; and therefore he must trust Part of it to such <HI>Tools</HI> as he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I have replied to the princip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Part of the <HI>Prisoner's Defence;</HI> from which we conceive there appears nothing material for his <HI>Justification.</HI> As to his being a <HI>Roman Priest▪</HI> this was only offered as an Induce∣ment to the Credit of the Testimony of the Witnesses who were brought to prove his being an Accessary to the Burning of his Majesty's House in the Fort; and was al∣lowed by <HI>the Court</HI> to be given in Evidence on this Tryal, upon the Authorities which were produced <HI>only</HI> for this Intent.—That he is a <HI>Priest,</HI> is what he has often con∣fessed and never denied▪ He has also confessed, that he is a <HI>nonjuring Priest,</HI> and consequently bears no good Will to the present Government.—But we have no Evidence of his having confessed himself a <HI>Roman Priest.</HI>—That he was reputed <HI>such,</HI> by some of his Acquaintance, is clear from what <HI>William Kane</HI> has told you▪ That he approved of their <HI>Practices,</HI> seems evident <HI>from his Con∣versation with Mr.</HI> Hildreth.</P>
<P>You have, doubtless, observed, that before the <HI>Prisoner</HI> made his <HI>Defence</HI> we read to him, in Latin, sundry Pas∣sages, and one of them out of an authentick Book of the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> being their Catechism, published by a Decree of the <HI>Council of Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t:</HI> These Passages we translated into <HI>English,</HI> in his Hearing; which shew <HI>the Usages of that Church</HI> to be agreeable to the Practice of the Prisoner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this City. We have shewn from the Writings of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesuits the <HI>Popish</HI> Doctrines concerning <HI>Absolution;</HI> and to what an Extent they carry that <HI>Im∣pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure</HI> and <HI>Cheat</HI> upon Mankind: This also has been read to the <HI>Prisoner,</HI> in <HI>French,</HI> and also translated into <HI>English.</HI> We urged that the Prisoner <HI>ought</HI> (if he <HI>cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI>) to shew that he was <HI>a Priest</HI> of some other Communion that maintained <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Usages,</HI> and preached such Doctrines; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not, his performing his <HI>Priest's Office</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> his <HI>baptizing with Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, his Use of the Crucifix;</HI> his exposing the <HI>Sacrament by lighted Candles;</HI> his preaching upon those <HI>Texts</HI> upon which the <HI>Papists</HI> pretend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the <HI>Pope's Supremacy,</HI> and, his declared Power to <HI>forgive Sins</HI> as well as <HI>God Almighty,</HI> will undoubtedly fix the <HI>Brand</HI> of a <HI>Roman Priest</HI> upon him.—To all this the Prisoner has made nothing tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can be properly called a <HI>Defence.</HI> He says, indeed, that there is no Proof of his having confessed himself a <HI>Roman Priest,</HI> nor that he has <HI>cele∣brated Mass:</HI> He tells us also that <HI>Nonjurors</HI> are not <HI>Papists;</HI> that their Principle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>passive Obedience and Non-Resistance;</HI> and seems willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> screen himself under that <HI>Denomination.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> though we have not proved, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a <HI>Roman</HI> Priest, <HI>by his own Confession,</HI> or his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Mass;</HI> yet he has not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> against him, are <HI>notorious Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es of Popery▪</HI> and such as we conceive will leave it pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any reasonable Doubt, that if he is a <HI>Priest at all, he is a Priest</HI> of the <HI>Romish Church.</HI></P>
<P>However, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> as I observed before, the prin∣ciple Point in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trial, is to prove <HI>that the Prisoner was an Accessary to the Burning of the King's House in the Fort;</HI> if you find also that he is a <HI>Roman Priest,</HI> then though he is <HI>Guilty,</HI> as the Indictment charges him, and has acted a most <HI>wicked Part</HI> in the publick and privat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mischiefs that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us, yet he has acted con∣sistent enough with the Principles of that <HI>corrupt</HI> and <HI>apostate Church,</HI> whereof he is a <HI>Member;</HI> and all that the Witnesses have declared against him, is the more easy to be believed.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>I shall add no more; but leave you to the Direction of <HI>the Court,</HI> and your <HI>own Consciences;</HI> not doubting but that you will weigh the Evidence which has been produced, and give such a <HI>Verdict</HI> in the present Case as will be consistent with your <HI>Oath</HI> and <HI>Duty.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Then the Chief Justice charged the Jury, and a Con∣stable being sworn to attend them, they withdrew; and having staid out about a Quarter of an Hour, returned, and found the Prisoner <HI>GUILTY</HI> of the Indictment.</P>

<P>ON Motion of Mr. Attorney General, the Prisoner was called up to Judgment; and being set to the Bar and asked, Whether he had aught to say in Arrest thereof, why Sentence of Death should not be pronounced against him? he had nothing to offer; but requested the Favour of the Court, that they would allow him as much Time as they could, before his Execution, for the Settling his private Affairs.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>The last Speech of JOHN URY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Christians,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now going to suffer a Death attended with Ignominy and Pain; but it is the Cup that my Heavenly Father has put into my Hand, and I drink it with Pleasure; it is the Cross of my dear Redeemer, I bear it with Alacrity; knowing that all that live godly in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> must suffer Persecution; and we must be made in some Degree Partakers of his Sufferings, before we can share in the Glories of his Resurrection: For he went not up to Glory before he ascended <HI>Mount Calvary;</HI> did not wear the Crown of Glory before the Crown of Thorns. And I am to appear before an awful and tremendous GOD, a Being of infinite Purity and unerring Justice; a God who by no Means will clear the Guilty, that cannot be reconciled either to Sin or Sinners: Now this is the Being at whose Bar I am to stand; in the Presence of this God, the Possessor of Heaven and Earth, I lift up my Hands, and solemnly protest, I am innocent of what is laid to my Charge: I appeal to the great God for my Non-knowledge of <HI>Hewson,</HI> his Wife, or the Creature that was hanged with them; I never saw them living, dying or dead; nor never had I any Knowledge or Confederacy with White or Black, as to any Plot: And, upon the Memorials of the Body and Blood of my dearest Lord, in the Creatures of Bread and Wine, in which I have commemorated the Love of my dying Lord, I protest that the Witnesses are perjured; I never knew the perjured Witnesses but at my Trial. But for a Removal of all Scruples that may arise after my Death, I shall give my Thoughts on some Points.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I firmly believe and attest, That it is not in the Power of Man to forgive Sin; that it is the Prerogative only of the Great God to dispense Pardon for Sin; and that those who dare pretend to such a Power, do
<PB N="175" REF="005413_0183_10173B73F8ACFCC8"/>
in some Degree commit that great and unpardonable Sin, the Sin against the Holy Spirit; because they pretend to that Power which their own Consciences proclaim to be a Lie.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> I solemnly attest and believe, That a Person having committed Crimes that have or might have proved hurtful or destructive to the Peace of Society, and does not discover the whole Scheme, and all the Persons concerned with them, cannot obtain Pardon from God: And it is not the taking any Oath or Oaths that ought to hinder him from confessing his Guilt, and all that he knows about it; for such Obligations are not only sinful, but unpardonable, if not broken: Now a Person firmly believing this, and knowing that an eternal State of Happiness or Misery depends upon the Performance or Non-performance of the above mentioned Things, can not, will not triffle with such important Affairs.</P>
<P>I have no more to say by Way of clearing my Inno∣cency, knowing that to a true christian unprejudiced Mind, I must appear guiltless; but however, I am not very sollicitous about it. I rejoice, and it is now my Comfort (and that will support me and protect me from the Crowd of evil Spirits that I must meet with in my Flight to the Region of Bliss assigned me) that my Conscience speaks Peace to me.</P>
<P>Indeed, it may be shocking to some serious Christians, that the holy God should suffer Innocency to be slain by the Hands of cruel and bloody Persons (I mean the Witnesses who swore against me at my Trial) indeed, there may be Reasons assigned for it, but as they may be liable to Objections, I decline them; and shally only say, that this is one of the dark Providences of the great God, in his wise, just and good Government of this lower World.</P>
<P>In fine, I depart this Waste, this howling Wilderness, with a Mind serene, free from all Malice, with a forgiving Spirit, so far as the Gospel of my dear and only Re∣deemer obliges and enjoins me to, hoping and praying, that JESUS, who alone is the Giver of Repentance, will convince, conquer and enlighten my Murderers Souls, that they may publickly confess their horrid Wickedness before God and the World, so that their Souls may be saved in the Day of the Lord JESUS.</P>
<P>And now a Word of Advice to you, Spectators: Behold me launching into Eternity; seriously, solemnly view me, and ask yourselves severally, how stands the Case with me? die I must: Am I prepared to meet my Lord, when the Midnight Cry is echoed forth? shall I then have the Wedding-Garment on? Oh Sinners! triffle no longer; consider Life hangs on a Thread, her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> To-day and gone To-morrow; forsake your Sins e'er ye be forsaken forever: Hearken, now is God awfully calling you to repent, warning you by me his Minister and Prisoner, to embrace JESUS, to take, to lay hold on him for your alone Saviour, in order to escape the Wrath to come; no longer delay, seeing the Summons may come before ye are aware, and you standing before the Bar of a God who is a consuming Fire out of the Lord Jesus Christ, should be hurled, be doomed to that Place, <HI>where their Worm dies not, and their Fire is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be quenched.</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Langhorn'<HI>s dying Speech, State Trials, ad Vol.</HI></NOTE></P>
</LETTER>
<P>NOTE, <HI>This Copy</HI> differs from <HI>that</HI> supposed to have been printed at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> soon after <HI>Ury'</HI>s Execution, which perhaps might have been altered and corrected by some of his Associates; as also <HI>that</HI> of his Defence made at his Trial, which was printed with it; for that in the fore-going Trial was taken from a Copy literally transcribed from one deliver'd in his own Hand Writing, without Points; it was therefore printed with <HI>Ury'</HI>s Mis-spellings, and unpointed, that the Reader may have a Specimen of his Schollarship, and from thence conjecture, whether the Defence and dying Speech were of his own genuine Product.</P>
<P><HI>The following Account concerning this Person, comes from a Gentleman who had several Conversations with him between the Time of his Sentence and Execution, who says Ury informed him,</HI></P>
<Q><P>THAT his Father was Secretary to the South Sea Company, but died when the said <HI>Ury</HI> was young.</P>
<P>That after the Death of his Father he was taken Care of by a Gentleman who bore the Character of a Non-Juror, <HI>but who, he had since Reason to believe, was a Jesuit.</HI></P>
<P>That he was educated at two Universities.—But what Universities they were he did not care to tell me.</P>
<P>That afterwards he became a Non-juring Clergyman; and that the Head of their Society was one Dr. <HI>Clarke.</HI></P>
<P>That while in this Character, he was taken up and tried <HI>for writing a Book against the Government;</HI> of which he was found guilty: Upon this Account, a Chappal he had of his own, and which brought him in 50 <HI>l. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. per Annum,</HI> was seized into the Hands of the Government, and he himself escaped with his Life, only through the Character and Interest of his Friends. Being thus reduced
<PB N="176" REF="005413_0184_10173B76F70E6FC8"/>
to difficult and disgraceful Circumstances, he could not bear to stay in a Place where he had once lived in Honour and Credit; and this occasion'd his Removal into <HI>America.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Says the Gentleman,</P>
<Q><P>I had a great Curiosity to know how far this Account of himself was true; and he having often told me, that he was intimately acquainted with a Gentleman of distinguish'd Worth and Character in <HI>London,</HI> with whom I had some Correspondence by Letters; I wrote to that Gentleman, desiring, if he knew any Thing of this <HI>John Ury,</HI> that he would give me a particular Account of him and his Circumstances:</P>
<P>In Answer to my Request, he informed me,</P>
<P>THAT <HI>John Ury'</HI>s Father was a Secretary in the South-Sea, but dismissed before the great Advance of it in 1720; so that he had no Share in those Gains. That when he died he left his Family in the utmost Distress and Poverty.—This <HI>John Ury</HI> had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a Shop-Boy, to carry Messages, but educated to no Business or Profession.</P>
<P>His highest Ambition was to be a common Servant in a Family: He profess'd great Religion, went often to Worship with the Dissenters, but always communicated with the <HI>Church of England.</HI> He never heard of his writing against the Government, nor believed him capable of it, being without Education: At last, being disap∣pointed in most of his Designs, he fell into Dictraction.—From which Time this Gentleman heard Nothing of him, till the melancholly News from <HI>America,</HI> which was about the Space of three years.</P></Q>

<HEAD>JOURNAL of the PROCEEDINGS against the Conspirators at NEW-YORK: 1742.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="month">
<HEAD>JANUARY.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the Return of the Vessels that had transported the Negro Conspirators the last Summer, to various foreign Parts, many Particulars of Intelligence concerning the Conspiracy, which had dropt from those Criminals in their Discourse with the Captains, Passengers and others, were brought hither; from which there was Reason to apprehend, that this City and People were not yet out of Danger from this Hellish Confederacy, which had been so wickedly and maliciously formed against both; and considering the Hints the Negroes gave concerning <HI>the execrable Oath</HI> the Con∣spirators had engaged themselves in; it seemed probable that the like Attempts would be renewed, notwithstanding the many Examples that had been made by Executions, and the Number of Slaves sent out of the Province; for the Conspirators impiously looked upon the <HI>Oath</HI> to be so sacred, that they thought <HI>(as no Doubt they were made to believe)</HI> that the eternal Welfare of their Souls depended upon their strict Observance and Execution of it; <HI>for fear</HI> (as the <HI>Cant</HI> was, both of Whites and Blacks) that if they should reveal it, or desist from the Execution of the Engagements they were laid under by it, <HI>they should wrong their own Souls.</HI></P>
<P>Many Cabals of Negroes also had been discovered in diverse Parts of the Country, since the Execution and Transportation of the Conspirators, which justly caused Suspicion, that the same villainous Scheme was yet in Agi∣tation; particularly in <HI>Queen's County,</HI> on <HI>Nassau,</HI> alias <HI>Long-Island;</HI> the Negroes had there formed themselves into a Company about Christmass last, by Way of Play or Diversion (as they would have had it thought) had mustered and trained with the <HI>borrowed</HI> Arms and Accoutrements of their Masters, (or we would rather suppose, <HI>surreptitiously</HI> obtained) Information whereof having been given to His Honour the Lieutenant Governor, he immediately ordered his Majesty's Attorney General to write to the Justices of that County about it, and to expostulate with them upon the Occasion, and direct them to inflict due Punishment on the Offenders.</P>
<P>And the Negroes were accordingly chastised for this daring Piece of Insolence.</P>
<P>There having also been Reports about the same Time, of several pretended Prophecies of Negroes, <HI>That</HI> Charles-Town <HI>in</HI> South-Carolina, <HI>and the City of</HI> New-York, <HI>were to be burnt down on the Twenty fifth of</HI> March <HI>next;</HI> these Circumstances considered, and added to what had been wrote by General <HI>Oglethorpe,</HI> as before mentioned, <HI>That the declared Enemies had secretly conspired to burn down and destroy all his Majesty's Magazines in North-America;</HI> and considering what a Scene of monstrous Iniquity had been discovered the last Summer, tending to this detestable Pur∣pose; there seemed to be too much Reason to suspect, that these Sort of Divinations were founded upon a Conspiracy still subsisting, as well as in Part executed, both here and in <HI>South-Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>The Lieutenant Governor therefore thought it necessary to put the People upon their Guard, by writing circular Letters to the Magistrates of every City, Borough and County within this Government.</P>
<P>The following Letter was sent directed to the Mayor, Recorder and Aldermen of this City.</P>
<LETTER>

<SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER the providential Discovery of the late most execrable Conspiracy, and the hellish and barbarous Designs of a perverse and blood-thirsty People, for the Ruin and Destruction of the whole Province, and the Inhabitants thereof; and that even at a Time when all Things were ripe for Execution, and the intended Deso∣lation was so nigh at Hand; one would think our signal Preservation could never be forgot; and that no one could be so blind to himself, and regardless of his future Safety, as to suffer the Negroes to have private or publick Meetings and Caballings together; thereby giving them an Opportunity of forming new Designs, or another Conspiracy; knowing them to be a People whom no Example can reclaim, no Punishment deter, or Lenitives

appease; yet from the many undoubted Informations I have received from diverse Parts of the Country, the Insolence of the Negroes is as great, if not greater, than ever; and they are not only suffered to have private, but even publick Meetings, in great Numbers, without the least Molestation or Interruption from the Magistrates, and in Defiance of those Laws they ought to be the Protectors of, and see put in due Execution; thereby suffering them and themselves to be trampled on and insulted, to the endangering the Peace of the Province: If this Practice continues, what may we not fear? For I doubt there are too many yet remaining among us who were of the late Conspiracy; <HI>and though we have felled the Tree, I fear it is not entirely rooted up.</HI> I must therefore require you, as you value the Peace and Safety of this City and Province, and your own Preservation; and you are hereby strictly charged and required, to see the Laws against Negroes duly and punctually executed; suffering no Meetings of them within your City and County and several Districts: And, in order that the same may be more effectually done, I do hereby direct you to charge all the Constables and other Officers, to be diligent in their Duty, and that they apprehend and bring before you, or some of you, all and every one so offending; as also all such Person and Persons as shall be found to harbour Negroes, confederate or consort with them, that they may be proceeded against according to Law. And in order that every one may have Notice hereof▪ I do direct, that you cause this Letter to be read from time to time at your General Quarter Sessions; and that you give in Charge to the Grand Juries, that they make Enquiries concerning the Offenders▪ I doubt not but you will have Regard hereto, as it so highly concerns you all; and that you will take such prudent Measures as may prevent any future Disturbance.</P>

<P>AT the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace, held this Day for the City and County of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Jury being called and sworn, the above Letter was read; and the Recorder after observing upon, and endeavouring to enforce, the same by his Charge, like∣wise recommended to them to enquire in general concern∣ing Tavern keepers and Innholders entertaining of Negroes at their Houses, as a Crime of most pernicious and dange∣rous Tendency; and having received Information con∣cerning <HI>M</HI>—and <HI>Whitfield,</HI> two Tavern keepers, that they were much suspected of being guilty of that vile Practice (notwithstanding the latter was convicted upon an Indictment found against him for the like Crime, and fined thereupon the last Summer) the Recorder gave them par∣ticularly in Charge.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Grand Jury, as they were about to be discharged, reported, That they had enquired into the re∣spective Neighbourhoods of those two Persons, and that they could get no sufficient Information concerning this Matter whereon to found an Accusation against them.</P>
<P>But how well grounded the Lieutenant Governor's Apprehensions were, concerning the Danger which still threatned us from the Conspirators remaining amongst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may be conceived from what follows.</P>

<HEAD>MONDAY, 15th FEBRUARY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Morning about six o'Clock, it was providentially discovered, that some Fire had been put in the Gutter of a Shed adjoining to the House where <HI>Walter Hyer</HI> lived, next the Fence of the Old Dutch Church-Yard: The Wind blowing very hard at N. and the Gutter lying N. and S. some of the Coals were blown into the Street; which were accidentally discerned by one <HI>Hendricks▪</HI> a Carpenter, who was opening the Window-Shutters of a new House he was about finishing, fronting the End of the Street, in order to go to work; whereupon he immediately went to <HI>Hyer's</HI> House, and called him out of Bed; and they found some live Coals in the Gutter next the Shed towards the Church-Yard, and likewise a Brand's-End, or the Bark of a Brand's-End, on the other Side of the House next <HI>Ratsey'</HI>s: The Mayor being acquainted herewith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> summoned the Magistrates to meet his Morning at the City-Hall, to consult what Steps to take, in order to dis∣cover the Incendiaries▪ And the Magistrates being accor∣dingly met, it was proposed by one of them, as no particular Person was suspected, that they should all go and view the House and enquire what Negroes were in the Neighbour∣hood, and their Characters whereby the most Suspicious might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> laid hold of and examined; 'twas thought most likely; that by this Method the Truth might chance to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olt cut▪ They we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t accordingly and it luckily hap∣pened, that the first Person's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enquired after, was the Widow <HI>Bradt▪</HI> She kept a Bake-house near by, and her

Yard-ran along the Rear of <HI>Hyer'</HI>s and <HI>Ratsey'</HI>s Houses, up to the Church Yard Fence, where were an Heap of Oyster Shells lying so near <HI>Hyer'</HI>s Gutter, that a middle-siz'd Man might easily step up and put Fire in the Gutter, at the North End of it, and from the same Yard as easily throw a Brand's End on the other Side of the House next <HI>Ratsey'</HI>s: Upon the Enquiry, it was said that the Widow <HI>Bradt</HI> had only one Negro, <HI>a Sort of a simple half-witted Boy▪</HI> but however he was ordered to be brought forth; and he ap∣peared upon View to be a lusly well-set Fellow, of Man's Growth, and was afterwards judged (by those that knew him best, and had brought him into the Country) to be One or Two and Twenty Years old; his natural Counte∣nance was none of the pleasantest; but his Appearance upon this Occasion betokened Symptoms of Guilt: It was thought that Baker's Servants, from the Nature of their Business, must be up early, and have always a Command of Fire, which administred some Colour of Suspicion, which the Looks of the Fellow very much heighten'd; and there∣fore he was without Ceremony committed, in order for Examination in the Afternoon, and likewise some other Negroes of the Neighbourhood, who were afterwards discharged.</P>
<P>The Magistrates being met at three o'Clock in the Afternoon, and <HI>Tom</HI> asked, how he came to put the Fire to <HI>Hyer'</HI>s House▪ and who advised and assisted him in it? he directly owned, that he put the Fire in the Gutter him∣self: And being then very particularly examined, his Confession was taken down in Writing, in the Presence of the Justices, and by them signed.</P>

<P>THE Justices being met a fourth Time, in order to endeavour to pry further into this Mystery of Iniquity, by examining <HI>Tom</HI> once more; for as to what had been drawn from him hitherto one could not give entire Credit, as the Reader may conclude, excepting as to his being the Instrument of putting the Fire; and it being intimated by one of the Magistrates, that <HI>Tom'</HI>s Mistress had a <HI>strong</HI> Imagination (one might venture to say a <HI>strange</HI> One) that she and her Son, if the Magistrates would permit their Attendance, could prevail upon their Negro to speak the whole Truth. As there were many of us, there was Difference in Opinions upon this Matter. However, at length it was ruled, that they should be admitted, and were sent for accordingly. Upon their Appearance, <HI>Tom</HI> was admonished to tell the whole Truth, how it was concerning this Matter; and he declared himself at first to the same Purpose as to the Negroes he before accused, and as to the same Matter and Substance with his Examinations before set forth; but in the Close, as there was great Doubt made of his Veracity, being strenuously urged by some of the Magistrates, and his Master and Mistress, <Q>to be sure that he spoke nothing but the Truth;</Q> and being asked, whether he was sure that what he had said as to these Negroes was the Truth? he thereupon recanted, and declared what he had before related concerning the Negroes he had accused, were all Lies; and took the Whole upon himself. And being asked, why he did it, and how he came to do so? he answered, <HI>He could not help doing it.</HI></P>
<P>This Fellow having thus prevaricated, no Use could be proposed to be made of him as an Evidence to convict others, however he might have chanced to change his Note afterwards; and 'twas therefore determined to bring him upon his Trial. But it may be proper to observe, that in the Interval between <HI>Tom'</HI>s first and last Examination, the Negroes accused by him, were several Times closely examined, both separately and Face to Face; but they all along positively denied every Thing alledged against them by <HI>Tom</HI> concerning the setting Fire, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> but owned their

And</P>
<P>WILLIAM SMITH, <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> having been appointed by the Justices, Council and Prosecutor for the King, he delivered into Court Articles of Accusation against the Prisoner.</P>
<P>Before the Articles were read, the Freeholders were sworn, well and truly to try and judge as directed by the Act of Assembly; and the Recorder warned the Prisoner in Favour of Life, that he need not plead <HI>Guilty</HI> to any of the Articles, but nevertheless, that his several Confessions being read to the Court, would amount to full Proof, so far as they affected himself.</P>
<P>Then the Articles were read, and were as followeth,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Tom,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>Divertie Bradt</HI> of the said City, Widow, stands charged and accused,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> For that he the said <HI>Tom,</HI> on Sunday the seventh Day of <HI>February</HI> last past, at the Dock Ward of this City, did conspire with <HI>Jack,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>Jasper Farmer, Michael,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>Samuel Dunscombe, Peter,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>John Tudor,</HI> and <HI>Rob,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>Charles Crooke,</HI> of this City, and diverse other Negro Slaves unknown, to kill and murder the said <HI>Divertie Bradt▪ Baffie Vandewater,</HI> and other his Majesty's liege People within the City of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> For that he the said <HI>Tom,</HI> on Monday the fifteenth Day of <HI>February</HI> last past, did willfully put Fire to and burn the Shed or Outhouse of <HI>Baffie Vandewater,</HI> and the House of <HI>Andrew Bradford</HI> and <HI>Cornelia</HI> his Wife, in the Dock Ward of the same City.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="005413_0192_10170FE7ABF05E08"/>
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> For that he the said <HI>Tom,</HI> did on the fifteenth Day of <HI>February</HI> last past, at the City and Ward afore∣said, attempt to kill and murder <HI>Divertie Bradt</HI> and <HI>Baffie Vandewater,</HI> of this City, by setting Fire to their Houses, and burning them in the same.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That he the said <HI>Tom,</HI> on the fifteenth Day <HI>February</HI> last past, at the City and Ward aforesaid, did attempt to burn the Out-house of the said <HI>Divertie Bradt</HI> and the Dwelling-Houses of <HI>Baffie Vandewater,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Bradford</HI> and <HI>Cornelia</HI> his Wife, situate in the same Ward, and to burn the whole Town and City of <HI>New-York.</HI></P></Q>
<P>To the First Article the Prisoner pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>To the Second, <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>To the Third, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>As the Prisoner had pleaded Guilty to the Second Article, the Court were of Opinion to proceed to Judgment upon that; but Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> moved, that before they proceeded, some Witnesses might be sworn, and the Criminal's several Examinations and Confessions taken by the Justices, as before set forth, might be read for their further Informa∣tion concerning his Guilt, and for the greater Satisfaction of the Court and Audience.</P>
<P>And here it may not be improper to observe, that the Prisoner distinguished and pleaded to the three several Articles directly, without Hesitation; which seems to be a further Argument that he had more Sense than some People were willing to allow him.</P>
<P>Proclamations for Silence and Witnesses.</P>
<P>WITNESSES for the KING sworn, HENDRICKS and HYER.</P>
<P><HI>HENDRICKS</HI> said, <Q>he discovered the Fire to fall out of the Gutter as he was looking from a Window into the Street; and that thereupon he went and knocked at <HI>Hyer'</HI>s Door, and called him out of Bed, and they searched and found Coals on each Side of the House; some in the Gutter next the Shed, towards the Church-Yard, and some on the Side next <HI>Ratsey'</HI>s House.</Q></P>
<P><HI>HYER</HI> said, <Q>that the Gutter next the Church-Yard was burnt black in the Spot, or Part of the Gutter, where he found the Coals lying.</Q></P>
<P>The Criminal's Confessions read as before set forth.</P>
<P>And the Justices further informed the Court, that the Criminal at his last Examination, though he at the Begin∣ning of it persisted in the same Story as to his Accusation of <HI>Jack (Farmar's)</HI> prompting and proposing to him to put the Fire, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and as to the other Negroes present at the two Meetings at <HI>Farmar'</HI>s House, advising and threat∣ning him if he did not, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> yet in the Close he declared for Truth, that all he had said relating to them, were Lies, and that he put the Fire of his own Head; and being ask'd, why he did it, and how he came to do so? he answered, he could not help doing it. And being asked by the Court, whether he did not make such Confessions as had been then just read? he answered, <HI>Yes.</HI> He was then bid to tell the same Story over again as he had told to the Justices at the three first Examinations, and likewise at the first Part of the fourth and last; and he repeated the same over again, as it were in the same Words: And when he had done, being asked, whether what he had then said as to the other Negroes was true? he answered, <HI>No, 'twas all Lies;</HI> and took all again upon himself, and owned his Recantation to be the Truth.</P>
<P>The Audience being ordered to withdraw, the Prisoner taken from the Bar, and the Court▪Room cleared; the Recorder advised with the Justices and Freeholders; and having taken their Opinions, which were unanimous upon that Occasion, the Doors were ordered to be opened, and the Prisoner brought back; and being accordingly brought back, the Recorder proceeded to Admonition and Sentence, as followeth:</P>
<Q><P>YOU <HI>Tom,</HI> the Criminal at the Bar, hearken to what is now to be said to you.</P>
<P>You stand convicted of willfully putting Fire to and burning the Shed or Out-house of <HI>Baffie Vandewater</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Laid in her Name in the Articles of Accusation, being Owner of the House;</HI> Walter Hyer <HI>Tenant</HI></NOTE> within this City. The Evidence of your Guilt has stood principally upon your own Confession before your Trial; which you now confirm by your Plea: And indeed this is the strongest Proof, the highest Conviction that can be: For this single Fact you deserve Death: And though the Court proceeds to give Judgment against you upon this Article; yet your Offence is of a com∣plicated Nature, <HI>i. e.</HI> consists of many Particulars, all tending to one and the same monstrous and execrable Purpose; the Murdering the Inhabitants of this City.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="005413_0193_10173B909190F6A8"/>
The hellish Scheme you have engaged in, as you have confessed before the Magistrates over and over again (I think no less than four several Times) was, to set <HI>Walter Hyer'</HI>s House on fire, and (as you concluded and proposed) that would consequently set the next House (<HI>Ratsey'</HI>s) on fire, and that would set your Mistress's on fire, and burn your Mistress in it; and then that would burn the whole Town: Then the <HI>Long-Island</HI> Negroes were to come over to the Assistance of the Negroes here▪ and they, in Conjunction, were to murder all the White People of this City: And, in order that your malicious hellish Purposes might effectually take Place, the Fire was to be put, as it actually was, when the Wind blew hard, that in all Probability, any Attempts made to extinguish the Flames, might be in vain.</P>
<P>And such a trusty Agent have you been in the Devil's Service, that in prosecution of this infernal Conspiracy, you did actually take the first Step proposed, in order to accomplish this diabolical Purpose, by putting Fire to <HI>Hyer'</HI>s House on both Sides of it.</P>
<P>All this that I have said, you have confessed over and over again; and in this we must take your Word: It was a merciful Act of Providence that your Designs were timely prevented, that you were committed upon Suspicion only, and that thereupon the Truth has thus bolted out from you.</P>
<P>It was rumoured without Doors, that you were an half-witted Fellow (Boy I think they called you, though you are said to be Two or Three and Twenty Years old) and indeed one would think hardly any Body but arrant Fools, or Mad-Folks, would engage in such chimerical, wicked, villainous and dangerous Projects, which must most probably end in the Confusion, and Destruction, of the Wretches concerned; as you found by woful Experi∣ence in the many Examples of those miserable Creatures of your Colour that expired in Flames, and at the Gallows, the last Summer, for the like detestable Offen∣ces: And yet so hardened and stupified are ye in Villainy, that no Examples though ever so severe, no Terrors of Punishment can affright ye; but ye will even defie the Gallows and commit your Bodies to the Flames, rather than not risque the Chance of gratifying, your savage, cruel, and insatiable Thirst for Blood.</P>
<P>But nevertheless, to convince one that you are not that half-witted Fellow, as some would represent you, you shewed some Cunning (as it should seem you thought) after your Commitment, in providing for your own Safety and Preservation, by laying this Scheme upon and accusing others, as having prompted you to this Mischief, hoping thereby, as it must be supposed, to be admitted an Evidence against them, and so save your own Life: This was a Thought too deep for a Fool, or half-witted Fellow: And indeed from my Observation of you, during the Course of your several Examinations, I could discover no Reason for an Insinuation, that you had less Sense than those of the common Rank of Negroes, but that your Qualifications for Mischief are inferior to none of them; That you have Sense enough to distinguish between Good and Evil; that your own Conscience could direct you what was fit and proper to be done, and what not; you yourself, by your own Confessions have given most convincing Proofs; for when (as you all along said, till the last Time when you recanted and declared that what you had told concerning the other Negroes was all Lies, I say, as you told the Story) <HI>Jack (Farmar's)</HI> in order to try whether you were fit for the Undertaking, said to you, <HI>Tom your Mistress is cross to you, you must set fire to the Offdackye, then that will burn</HI> Hyer'<HI>s House, that will burn</HI> Ratsey'<HI>s House, then that will burn your Mistress's House, and burn your Mistress in it:</HI> Your Answer to <HI>Jack</HI> upon this Proposal was, <HI>No, my Mistress no cross to me, my Mistress good enough, what should I set Fire for? you may do it yourself;</HI> or Words to that Effect: That thereupon <HI>Jack</HI> insisted, that you should set fire, and the Reason why you at last agreed to do it, was because, you said, <HI>Jack threatned he would poison you if you did not.</HI> This is what we call natural Reason, and shews such a Measure of it, or there is such a Chain of Consequences drawn by it, that supposing it to be your own Scheme (as you now take all upon your self) you can be no Fool, or half-witted Fellow; and if it was the Scheme of others proposed to yourself, your very Repetition of it, your telling that Story as you have done so often over and over again, almost in the same Words, shews that you don't want Understanding; but that you have made a very bad Use of it, and acted against that Light, which God Almighty has given you to employ to better Purposes: So that here, I say, in these Instances of the very Proposal and Answer, you give convincing Proof, that you were conscious, <HI>i.e.</HI> that you yourself was sensible and knew, that what you was going to attempt was wrong, was wicked, and what you ought not to do: Whether <HI>Jack (Farmar's)</HI> was the Person that proposed the Thing to you, we cannot tell; but that somebody did, and that you did not do it alto∣gether of your own Head, I am fully persuaded▪ But if no one but the Devil and you contrived it; then so much must be drawn from it, as is sufficient to shew, that you acted against the Light of your own Conscience, your own Reason, by your own Way of arguing, and <HI>out of your own Mouth you are judged.</HI> How you came at last to withdraw your Accusation against those Negroes, you

for four Examinations running, charged with advising you, and being concerned with you, in this villainous Project, I know not; nor can I account for it, without the Devil had a Mind to leave you in the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch at last.</P>
<P>You Negroes are treated here with great Humanity and Tenderness; ye have <HI>no hard Task-Masters, ye are not lade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with too heavy Burthens;</HI> but your Work is moderate and easy: You say,<HI>your Mistress no cross to you, she very good, or she good enough;</HI> and yet with small Per∣suasion, you were prevailed upon to destroy her in Flames: Such worthless, detestable Wretches are many, it may be said most, of your Complexion, that no Kindnesses can oblige ye; there is such an Untowardness, as it should seem, in the very Nature and Temper of ye, that ye grow cruel by too much Indulgence: So much are ye degenerated and debased below the Dignity of Humane Species, that even the <HI>brute Animals</HI> may upbra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d ye; for <HI>the Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Ass his Master's Crib;</HI> even the very Dogs also will, by <HI>their Actions</HI> express <HI>their</HI> Gratitude to the Hand that seeds them, their Thankfulness for Kindnesses; they will fawn and fondle upon their Masters; nay, if any one should attempt to assault them, they will defend them from Injury, to the utmost of their Power. Such is the <HI>Fidelity</HI> of these <HI>dumb Beasts;</HI> but ye, <HI>the Beasts of the People,</HI> though ye are cloath'd and fed, and provided with all Necessaries of Life, without Care; in Requital of your Benefactors, in <HI>Return for Blessings ye give Curses, and would scatter Firebrands, Death and Destruction around them,</HI> destroy their Estates and <HI>butcher</HI> their Persons. Thus monstrous is your Ingratitude! Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thanks be to Almighty God, that through his wondrous and merciful Providence, your hellish Devices are discovered, and you are now to reap the just Reward of your Labours.<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"> Note, <HI>As there was like to be a large Audience at this Trial, thus far was calculated principally with a View to awaken the People to a Sense of their Danger with respect to the Negroes, and other Conspirators, and to put them upon their Guard; whereas some light-headed People (and others, as it is to be feared with deeper Design, in order to put a Stop to further Discovery) had taken no small Pains to bring a Discredit upon the Story of the Plot, though they had seen Houses burnt to the Ground, and others on fire about our E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, and no one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld find out, if they were not done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Purpose, how they came to be so Whether this extravagant Behaviour of the former were owing to an Apprehension of having their own Negroes brought in Question, and suffering by the Loss of them, it might seem hard to say: But so excessive was the Folly and Wantonness of some, and the execrable Malice and Villainy of others!</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>And since Justice has at last overtaken you, I shall in Compassion to your poor Soul, which is in the utmost, the greatest Danger of being forever miserable, give you a Word of Advice. in order to prevail upon you to make use of those few Moments you have to remain in this World, to the best Advantage; for be not deceived, there is another World after this, and there is a God above who has a clear View of all your Actions, and <HI>knows the very Secrets of your Hearts,</HI> and will require at your Hands according to that Degree of Reason which he has given you▪ And though your Body be consumed in the Flames here on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arth (a Punishment of short Continuance) yet your Soul will never dye; that must survive the Body, either to be forever happy, or for∣ever miserable, according to your Actions here.</P>
<P>What a horrible shocking Expectation must yours be then! You that would murder and destroy without Mercy, nay without Provocation; what reasonable Hopes can you entertain of Mercy from the Hands of the God of Justice, who will reward every Man according to his Works? They that have done Good shall be for∣ever happy; they that have done Evil shall be cast into a Sea of Fire and Brimstone, to be forever tormented with the Devil and his accursed Spirits, from whence there will be no returning, no coming out again, but there will be bitter weeping and wailing, and gnashing of Teeth, Time without End.</P>
<P>Now to avoid this dreadful everlasting Punishment, the only Method for you to take, is to make the best Use of the Time allowed you between this and your Execu∣tion, by bringing yourself to a due Sense of your Guilt, your heinous crying Sins; truly to repent you of, and be heartily sorry for your Wickedness, and earnestly to pray to God Almighty for Forgiveness: And this is not all; but that your Repentance may be sincere, you must make that little Amends which is in your Power, towards us you have designed, and conspired to murder and destroy, by discovering all those Persons whom you know to be any Ways engaged, or concerned in this hellish Plot, that you may thereby prevent all further Mischief. Upon these Conditions only can you have any reasonable or well-grounded Hope or Expectation of the Salvation of your Soul, and of avoiding that dread∣ful eternal Punishment, against which I have forewarned you.</P>
<P>And now it were but just, that the same Mischief which you intended for others should fall upon your own Pate; but the Court has had some Regard to your Confession, as you acknowledged your Guilt upon your.

<P>And therefore the Sentence which I am to pronounce against you is,</P>

<P>The Court then ordered the Execution to be on Friday next between the Hours of Ten and One.</P>
<P>But his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, by Advice of his Majesty's Council, thought proper to reprieve him to the Friday seven night.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> after his Condemnation returned to his old Story as to <HI>Jack (Farmar's)</HI> advising him to set fire, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and brought in <HI>Philip (Duyckink's)</HI> as joining with <HI>Jack</HI> therein, and in the Threatnings to poison or kill him, if he did not; but <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> were several times exa∣mined after <HI>Tom'</HI>s Condemnation, and confronted with him, and the charged them to their Faces, but they could not be brought to a Confession.

<P><HI>PHILIP (Duyckink'</HI>s Negro) being examined, says,</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. THAT he was at <HI>Jack (Farmar'</HI>s) on Sunday about a Month ago; in the Afternoon, in Church Time, he was going by <HI>Farmar'</HI>s House to Church, and <HI>Jack</HI> called him in, and he found in the Yard <HI>Kingston, Peter (Tudor's) York (Debrosse'</HI>s in the Square) <HI>Tom (Bradt'</HI>s Negro) called amongst them <HI>Monkey,</HI> to the Number of six with <HI>Jack</HI> and himself: They all plaid at Pennies; and the Examinant lost two Pence, and then went away just before Church out, in order to fetch his Mistress's Stove from Church, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> left all the others in the Yard.</P>

<P N="3">3.

<P><HI>JACK (Farmar'</HI>s) though he denied it at first, now owns, <Q>that <HI>Philip (Duykink'</HI>s) and <HI>Oronoko (Marston'</HI>s) were at his Mistress's in the Yard one Sunday, but did not see them play at Pennies but each of them once on different Sundays; and that <HI>Oronoko</HI> came to his House frequently on a Week-Day.</Q></P>

<P>THE Negro <HI>Tom</HI> was executed.</P>
<P>At the Gallows he declared, <Q>That now he was sure he must die, he would tell the Truth, and said, that <HI>Jack (Farmar'</HI>s) <HI>Philip (Duyckink's) Cuffee (William Gilbert'</HI>s) and <HI>Corah (David Van Horne'</HI>s) were the Persons that put him upon setting the Fire.</Q></P>

<HEAD>MONDAY, 15th MARCH.</HEAD>
<P>A Tanner's Barkhouse, belonging to one <HI>Stevens</HI> was set on fire, in the Swamp at the East End of this City, the Wind blowing exceeding hard at N. W. The Alarm of Fire was between Twelve and One o' Clock, which put the People into great Consternation; but the Tan-Pits being detached some Distance from any Dwelling-Houses, it did no other Damage than the Burning a few wooden Work-and Bark-houses belonging to the Tanners there.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="005413_0196_10173B9CC3E04388"/>
Upon Enquiry it was found, that two of <HI>Stevens'</HI>s Negroes, <HI>Sam</HI> and <HI>Tom,</HI> and also his White Servant Boy <HI>(John)</HI> had been at work there in the Morning; and it being cold, they had made some Fire under the Wind near the Work-house, and had inclosed the Fire on both Sides with two Doors or Boards, to prevent the Eddy Wind from blowing the Fire about.</P>
<P>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Twelve o'Clock these Servants all left off Work, in order to go home to Dinner.

<P>The Bark-house was a new close boarded Building, ad∣joining to a Stable and Mill-house, on the Side of the Yard opposite to the Work-house, under the Side of which the Fire was made by the Servants in the Yard; and the Bark-house was at the End of those Buildings first mentioned, farthest out of the Course of the Wind; so that it was most improbable that any Coals could have been blown thither; and it seem'd to be agreed on all Hands, that the Fire must have been put there on Purpose.</P>

<HEAD>Examinations taken this Day, and several other succeeding Days, before the Mayor, Recorder and several of the Aldermen, concerning the Fire at the Tan-Yards in the Swamp.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PAUL ROMME</HI> saith, <Q>That being at the Tan-Yards in <HI>Beekman's Swamp,</HI> on Monday near One o'Clock, he heard the Cracking as of Cedar, or Boards on Fire; that looking around him he soon heard the Cry of <HI>Fire, Fire,</HI> and immediately thereupon perceived a great Flame and Blaze break through the upper Part of the Roof of the Bark-house of Mr. <HI>John Stevens;</HI> that the Blaze, Fire and Smoke spread in a surprizing Manner, and took to the Stable, Mill-house, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> in a very short Time, that when he came to the Fire, he found there <HI>Hendrick Vandewater,</HI> a young Man belong∣ing to <HI>Dobson,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> That he does not believe, <HI>that the Fire, which broke out of the Roof, did proceed from the Fire that was made in the Yard at the Side of the Work-house; believes it was set on fire on Purpose,</HI> but does not know by whom.</Q></P>
<P><HI>HENDRICK VANDE WATER</HI> said, <Q>That standing at his Father-in-Law's House with <HI>Daniel Van Dursen,</HI> he perceived a Smoke go out from one of the Houses at the Tan Yards at <HI>Beekman's Swamp;</HI> upon which he desired <HI>Van Dursen</HI> to look at the Place, and said he believed it was on fire; that continuing to look, he found the Smoke increase; upon which he ran towards it, and <HI>Van Dursen</HI> after him; That when he came to the Bark-house of <HI>John Stevens,</HI> he saw a great Blaze and Fire strike through the upper Part of the Roof; that this was near One o'Clock Yesterday After∣noon: <HI>That this Fire could not,</HI> as he apprehends and believes, <HI>proceed from the Fire that was in the Yard at the Side of the Work house;</HI> but believes it was set on fire by Hand.</Q></P>
<P><HI>JOHN BASS, Stevens'</HI>s White Boy, said, <Q>That <HI>Sam</HI> told him to go and help <HI>Tom</HI> to fill the Jugg, (this <HI>John</HI> denied this Morning, and <HI>Sam</HI> just now says, that he and <HI>Sam</HI> shut all the Doors together) That when he and <HI>Tom</HI> did return with the Water, they did not find <HI>Sam</HI> near the Place where the Fire had been, nor did they stand there with him; that he did not see <HI>Sam</HI> till he passed the Work-house, and then <HI>Sam</HI> stood within five Yards of Mr. <HI>Bonnett'</HI>s Lime-house.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> said, <Q>When he went for Tea-Water, he left <HI>Sam</HI> and the White Boy at the Fire by the Work-house, and that it was not then put out, nor did he see it put out, but that <HI>Sam</HI> said he had put it out with Water: That he did not see <HI>Sam</HI> stand at the Water-hole, nor did he see him till he came to the Lime-house of Mr. <HI>Bonnett,</HI> when he saw him stand at the little Gate waiting for <HI>Tom</HI> and the White Boy; that the White Boy came to <HI>Tom</HI> after he had filled his Jugg with Tea-Water: That he did not stand at the Side of the Work-house with <HI>Sam</HI> and the white Boy, after his Return with the Tea-Water.</Q></P>
<P><HI>WILLIAM ROGERS</HI> said, <Q>That on the fifth Instant, being Friday, in the Afternoon about Five of the Clock, being at the Tan-Yards in <HI>Beekman's Swamp,</HI>at work for Mr. <HI>Bonnett, Sam,</HI> a Negro belonging to <HI>John Stevens,</HI> delivered to this <HI>Rogers,</HI> a Piece of Gold called a Double Doubleloon, which was very black, and desired him to get it changed for him into other smaller Money; that <HI>Rogers</HI> deliver'd this Gold to Mr.<HI>Stevens,</HI> who took his Negro up Stairs and whipp'd him: That afterwards, being Saturday, said <HI>Sam</HI> came again to the Tan-Yards, where finding said <HI>Rogers, Sam</HI> said, <HI>Well,</HI> William, <HI>you have occasioned my Master's whipping of me, who said, he would
<PB N="189" REF="005413_0197_10173B9EE0BAA980"/>
whip me again; but I will be even with you for it:</HI> That said <HI>Rogers</HI> afterwards acquainted Mr. <HI>Stevens</HI> with these threatning Speeches of his Negro, who answered him, Don't fear him, he'll not hurt you, he is an harm∣less Fellow.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>BONNETT</HI> said, <Q>That Mr. <HI>Stevens</HI> told him he would or had whipp'd his Negro; but understood that he said he had whipp'd him; that the Negro told him, that his Master had whipp'd him: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was touching the Doubleloon spoken of by <HI>William Rogers.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Sam</HI> said, <Q>That he shut the back Door; that no Body was then with him; that he then came out at the Stable Door, and shut it, no Body being then with him; that at these Times <HI>Tom</HI> and the White Boy were gone for Tea-Water: That when <HI>Tom</HI> and the White Boy returned, <HI>Sam</HI> stood where the Fire had been, under the Side of the Work-house; that <HI>Tom</HI> and the White Boy came to him where the Fire had been, and stood a little While; that they could see that the Fire was put out; that the White Boy then said, <HI>Come,</HI> Sam, <HI>let us go home:</HI> That <HI>Tom</HI> and the White Boy were gone for Tea Water about ten Minutes: That after putting out the Fire he put the Shovel into the Stable; that after putting out the Fire, and before putting the Shovel into the Stable, he put the Shovel into the Water of one of the Coops: That <HI>Tom</HI> did not ask him, whether he had put out the Fire; nor did he tell him that he had, nor the White Boy either.</Q></P>
<P>This Fire at the Tan-Pits just brought the Year round, to <HI>St. Patrick'</HI>s Day, the Evening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>of the last Year (as the Reader may have observed from the Course of the Evidence) was calculated by the Conspirators <HI>for burning the Fort;</HI> a Place, no Doubt, most likely to give them the greatest Annoyance; which, though accordingly attempted, was not however effected till the next Day. Why that particular Time was fix'd upon, from what afterwards appeared in Evidence concerning the Conspiracy, was no difficult Matter to conjecture; for, as that was an Evening of National rejoicing, according to the Custom of some, it were most likely that many would then be incapacitated for giving that Assistance, which the Nature of their Duty might require, in time of extraordinary Emergency; and therefore, it seems to have been a principal Aim of the Conspirators, to attempt the Destruction of the <HI>Fort</HI> at all Events, and at that particular Time; especially <HI>as some of the Soldiers themselves</HI> were proved afterwards to be of that villainous Confederacy; who also well knew of what Consequence it might be to their diabolical Scheme, to have that Place demolished; and, no Doubt, <HI>these Miscr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> were engaged, and accordingly endeavoured, to chear up their innocent <HI>Comrades,</HI> as well as their <HI>wicked Confede∣rates,</HI> to such a Pitch, under Colour of this <HI>national Festival,</HI> as might render the former <HI>useless,</HI> and the latter <HI>desperate▪</HI> For, as the Secrets of this infernal Confederacy were after∣wards unfolded, 'tis scarce to be doubted, that had the Fire at the Fort taken Effect on <HI>St. Patrick's Night,</HI> there would then have been a General Insurrection of the Negroes, and the Whites their Abettors; and much more Mischief done, probably many Persons, nay Families, <HI>butchered,</HI> had not the Providence of GOD most remarkably interposed in our Favour, by preventing the Fire's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king Effect that Night, as the Conspirators purposed it should.<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Negro</HI> Quack's <HI>Confession, pag.</HI> 45. <HI>col.</HI> 2. § 3. <HI>pag.</HI> 46.

But soon after the Examples had been made of many of the Conspirators, by Executions and Transportations, it seemed as if the People had almost generally composed themselves into a tranquil Security; some by discrediting, others (as one would imagine) forgetting, that there had been a <HI>real Conspiracy;</HI> though from reiterated Accounts still daily arriving by Masters of Vessels, to this Time, of what the transported Negroes had in their Passages declared concerning it, There seemed too much Reason to apprehend, there were yet remaining among us, many of the Associates in that execrable Confederacy, who might yet be hardy enough to persist in the same wicked Purposes, and make new Attempts; and as an Earnest of it, two fresh Alarms we have already passed over; and had but the last taken Effect, when a str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Wind favoured the Design, perhaps, <HI>St. Patrick'</HI>s <HI>Day</HI> might have been an Anniversary in our Calender, to have been commemorated by the Colony with FASTING, WEEPING and MOURNING.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION:</HEAD>
<P>BY the Course of the Evidence, it appears. That a Design was conceived to destroy this City by Fire, and massacre the Inhabitants: That Fire was to be put to several Quarters of the Town, at one and the same Time: That the <HI>English Church</HI> was to be set on Fire, at a Time when 'twas most likely there would be the fullest Congregation, and the Avenues from the Church were to be guarded by these Ruffians▪ in order to butcher those that should attempt to escape the Flames: This Part of the Scheme, it seems, <HI>Ury</HI> the <HI>Priest,</HI> had particularly at Heart.—The Winds were consulted which would be most proper to attempt the Fires with: They were to begin at the East End of the Town with a strong Easterly Wind, which (as it was projected) according to the Course <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Situation, would probably destroy the whole Town; but the King's <HI>Fort</HI> was <HI>first</HI> to be burnt, because most likely to annoy these <HI>Furies,</HI> when their hellish Devices were putting in Execution The Negro Confederates were each of them to se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fire to his Master's House, and proceed to the Assassinating their respective Masters and Families; and these Fires were calculated for the Night—<HI>St. Patrick's</HI> Night was the Time appointed. Accordingly we find, as a Proof that they were in earnest, the Attempt upon the <HI>Fort</HI> was made on <HI>St. Patrick's Night,</HI> tho' through the Providence of GOD, the Fire did not take Effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the next Day at Noon, when the Villain who first put it, had renewed his Effort, by blowing up the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Brand that he had placed for the Purpose the Night before.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Note upon</HI> Quack'<HI>s Confession at the Stake, pag.</HI> 46. <HI>letter p.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>If▪ it be considered, that many of the <HI>Irish Catholicks,</HI> unknown to the Captain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Runagates, or perhaps purposely <HI>sent over,</HI> had been enlisted in some of the Independent Companies posted here, some whereof were detected of being confederated with the Conspirators; they could not have pitch'd upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tter Season for perpetrating their bloody Purposes; for on this Night, according to Custom, their Commemoration of their Saint, might be most likely to excite in those of the infernal League, Boldness and Resolution, for the Execution of this horrible Enterprize, and others innocently partaking of their Jollity, might in such an Event, be thereby incapacitated for Service; so that according to this Device, all (it might seem probable to them) would lie at their Mercy. But the Fire at the <HI>Fort</HI> happening in the Day, contrary to the Purpose of the Con∣spirators, and the Town having been much alarmed at the Misfortune, tho' not apprehending the Treachery; yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> military Watch being kept all the Night following, the Villains were thereat somewhat intimidated, and stopt their Progress for a While: Nevertheless, from the nightly Cabals of the Conspirators, at <HI>Hughson's,</HI> and the Encouragement given by <HI>Ury</HI> the <HI>Priest,</HI> the Night after the Fort burnt, who told them, <HI>Now God had prospered them in the Beginning, in burning the</HI> Fort, <HI>they need not fear; we must be resolute and proceed in the Work, and no doubt God will prosper us in all;</HI> execrable Wretch! From hence they took Courage again, and it was resolved amongst them, that they should proceed. Accordingly after one Week had passed, they did, we see, set Fire to several Houses within the Compass of a Fort∣night, sometimes many in a Day, undiscovered; and made several other Attempts in which they were frustrated, 'till at length some <HI>Spanish</HI> Prize Negroes having been seized and committed upon Suspicion, a Stop was put to their Career. But more than a Fortnight pass'd after the last of these Fires, before the least Intimation was given touching the Occasion of them, that they were the Effects of a dia∣bolical Conspiracy; 'til <HI>Mary Burton,</HI> Servant to <HI>John Hughson,</HI> was brought before the <HI>Grand Jury,</HI> as a Witness to a different Matter, concerning which she had testified before the Magistrates; she at first refusing to be sworn to give her Evidence in that Case to the Grand Jury, at length rather than go to J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l submitted, but withal bolted out, that she would give no Evidence <HI>concerning the Fires:</HI> This Hint afforded sufficient Handle to the Gentlemen of the Grand Jury, to exert their Diligence in sifting out her Meaning, and to prevail with her to disclose the Secret; which, after much Entreaty and Persuasion, they effected, tho' at the same Time, the Girl dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urthen'd herself with apparent Dread and great Unwillingness, from the Apprehension of the Danger she should be in of being murdered by the Con∣spirators for the Discovery, as she afterwards declared.</P>

By the Evidence of this Girl, it appears, that her Master <HI>Hughson</HI> was a Principal, Engine, Agent and Instigator of these Deeds of Darkness amongst the Slaves here, ever since she came into his Service; and by the Evidence of others, Whites and Blacks, it also appears, that he having kept a publick House for some Years, had long since made it a Practice to entertain Numbers of Negroes, often 20, 30, 40 or 50 at a Time, and by Degrees deluded them to en∣gage in the Conspiracy, upon his Promises, that they should all be Freemen, and that other fine Things should be done for them; that upon their consenting, <HI>Hughson</HI> always bound them to their Engagements by <HI>horrible Oaths,</HI> not only to perform what they undertook to do, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>burn and mas∣sacre,</HI> but also to keep <HI>all secret,</HI> though they were to die for it; that these Oaths were reiterated at all future Meetings in order to confirm them; and for their Encouragement, <HI>Hughson</HI> often swore himself over again, and had sworn his Wife and Daughter into the Confederacy also That <HI>Hughson</HI> provided Arms and Gunpowder, further to convince these deluded Wretches, how much he was in earnest; but the Butchery to be executed by the Negroes after they had set Fire to their Masters Houses, was calculated to be done with Knives; for those Weapons, it seems they judged, would make no Noise: This the whole Current of Negro Evidence agrees in, and 'tis corroborated by Whites.—That a Knife designed for this Purpose was actually found in the Chest of one of the Negro Conspirators, and most others of them were provided with Knives.</P>
<P>That <HI>Hughson</HI> employed some of the Head Negroes as Agents under him, to decoy other Negroes, and their In∣structions were not to open the Conspiracy to any but <HI>those</HI> that were of their <HI>own</HI> Country (as they are brought from different Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and might be suppos'd best to know the Temper and Disposition of each other) and when they brought a Convert to <HI>Hughson,</HI> or one likely to become such, <HI>Hughson</HI> always gave them Drams 'til they were intoxicated, and then the Conspiracy was proposed to them; and they generally consented without much Difficulty, upon his specious Promises, and sometimes upon the bare Proposal; but if they were unwilling to engage, they were terrified by Threats of being murdered, 'til they complied<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then all such were constantly <HI>sworn,</HI> invited to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Feasts, and these commissioned to seduce others. Many before they knew any Thing of the Secret, were invited to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s by himself or others: For, by Way of Intro∣duction, as well as Confirmation. <HI>Hughson,</HI> it seems, kept open House for the Negroes, and entertained them at all Times; those that had no Money at free-Cost; He assured them, they should be always welcome to him: Those Compliments he artfully placed at he judg'd most proper; for us to such as were his special Agents and dexterous Fellows, they were to pay in Money if they had it, or Money's Worth, by pilfering and stealing as they could, to raise Supplies for carrying on the Common Cause; and they were to bring all to him; more especially upon the Grand Catastrophe, when the Town should be all in Flames, and the Negroes had butchered their respective Families, the most valuable Things easiest to be removed (particularly Plate) were to be brought to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, and it seems they had already carried on so successful a Trade, and <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House was become a Mart of so great Note amongst the Ne∣groes, that with them it had obtained the Name of <HI>Os<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,</HI> after the Province <HI>Trading-House.</HI> They were likewise injoined to steal their Masters's Arms, Powder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and lodge all in <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Custody: He had many Barrels of Gunpowder at a Time. It appears, that this hellish Project was set on foot here, by Agent <HI>Hughson,</HI> four or five Years before it was ripened for Execution; and it must needs have been a Work of Time to seduce so many Slaves as have been detected.</P>
<P>The White Conspirators were sworn by <HI>Ury</HI> the <HI>Priest,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> chief, and the Negroes sometimes by <HI>Hughson,</HI> and sometimes by <HI>Ury</HI> in a Ring surrounded by them, and <HI>he,</HI> whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Oath administring, holding a <HI>Crucifix</HI> over their Heads. They were persuaded that <HI>the French and Spaniards</HI> were soon to come and join them, and if they did not come in a set Time, they were to begin and do all themselves.—Further to encourage the Town Negroes, they were told the Con∣federates had many Whites and Blacks to come out of the Country to their Assistance, particularly from <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and <HI>Hughson</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to give the Word when they were to begin. The Negroes were flattered they were to be formed into Companies, several Officers of them were named for the Purpose, Captains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Town was divided into Districts. Thus all was to be their own, and if any of them were squeamish, <HI>Ury</HI> the <HI>Priest</HI> could forgive Sins, and did forgive them all they had committed, or should commit, <HI>provided they performed</HI> what they had engaged in, and kept all secret to their last Breath.</P>
<P>But however true these Matters have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to be, so chimerical, wicked, abominable and inhumane was the Device, that those at a Distance might have been apt to think it all a Dream, or a Fiction, were it not for the last Proof of a Reality, which cannot be withstood, the several Fires which did happen in the Manner we saw; which Consideration was a great Motive to this Publication.

at all, agree in the most considerable Articles concerning it; the Design of <HI>burning the Town, and murdering the Inha∣bitants:</HI> and that <HI>Popish Priests</HI> were concerned in it; which verifies, what is sarcastically cited in <HI>Ury's</HI> Defence as proverbial, <HI>That there can be no Mischief in a Country, but a</HI> Roman Priest <HI>(if there) must be in it;</HI> but we may venture to go one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ep further▪ and say, if <HI>such Priests</HI> had not been here (and some of Capacities much superior to <HI>Ury'</HI>s) there would have been no such Plot; for upon this and no other Footing can it be accounted for. Let us suppose then (and we sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> find just Grounds for the Supposal) that <HI>such Priests,</HI> or <HI>Monks, &amp;c.</HI> call them what you please, had conceiv'd a Design for such a horrible, detestable Purpose, as the Devastation of this City, and the Massacre of its Inhabitants, to be perpetrated by the Hands of our own Slaves, in Conjunction with the most abandoned Whites, the Dregs and Disgrace of their Complexion; and that at a critical Time, when their successful Wickedness would have frustrated the Supply of Provisions and Necessaries to his Majesty's Fleet, then upon an Expedition against his Enemies in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> upon which perhaps their Subsistence was in some Measure to rely; and that for the Purpose, Emissaries of these kind of <HI>Gentry</HI> were dispatch'd into his Majesty's Colonies, in several different Disguises, as those of <HI>Dancing-Masters, School-Masters, Physicians, &amp;c.</HI> who under these colourable Appearances, might be most likely to gain Admittance and Confidence in private Families, and thereby have Opportunities of debauching their Slaves, and acquainting themselves of such White People as might be most likely to be seduced to their detestable Purposes: Who then so seemingly proper Instru∣ments to be pitch'd upon amongst us, by such Infernal Agents, as <HI>John Hughson</HI> and <HI>such like?</HI> For as the Way to Hell must be trod by gradual Steps, and no one commences consummate Villain in an Instant; so <HI>Hughson</HI> had already taken some hopeful Degrees in the School of Wickedness; he had for many Years entertained Negroes at his House in all Hours of Darkness; and to support that Expence, and promote his own Lucre, encouraged them to pilfer and steal what they could from their Masters, and he readily received their Spoils: This might be thought a promising Earnest of his Qualifications; sure such a one must be judged, by these Craftsmen, a hopeful Tool to make Experiments upon; for he that could consort with Slaves in one kind of Villainy, would probably make the less Difficulty of going some Steps further. But then his Religion! Why truly, from what has already been observed, it might be thought to little Purpose to talk about that: But his Wife (good Woman!) was already a profess'd <HI>Papist,</HI> as common Fame has it; so the Business might be near half done; for her Persuasion join'd to a <HI>Roman Priest'</HI>s Assistance, Artifice and dairty fine Promises, free and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull Remission, Pardons, Indulgencies, and Absolution for Sins past, present, and to come, and a Passport for Heaven on Condition of per∣forming Engagements [to do the Devil's Business] bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sanction of reiterated Oaths, to keep all secret to the last Breath; he might perhaps (as others before him have been) be buoy'd up in full Expectation of becoming rich and great here, and of a Fool's Paradise hereafter, and thus be seduced to enter into their abominable Measures.</P>

<Q><P>Neither [says he] do I find these Gentlemen have said any Thing upon the Affair of <HI>Elizabeth Oxley, Nicholas Stubb,</HI> and the <HI>Priest Maurice Gifford;</HI> which however is a Matter of no small Importance. We find by the Deposition of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,</HI> That the great <HI>Fire of London</HI> hap∣pened by a horrible Conspiracy of the <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>English Papists.</HI> The Depositions of <HI>Bedlow</HI> prove also, that in the Year 1676, when <HI>he</HI> was at <HI>Paris,</HI> the Confederates in the Conspiracy, amongst others, a <HI>Benedictine</HI> wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have engaged him to set Fire to <HI>Westminster, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>other Places,</HI> and that <HI>Father Gifford</HI> had joined him∣self in this Design; in the Execution whereof they had actually hired Cellars in diverse Parts of the City, which they filled with Wood, Charcoal, and all other Sorts of Combustibles. The Story of <HI>Elizabeth Oxley</HI> strongly confirms that Deposition.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Rapi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Folio Vol. 2. pag.</HI> 705.</NOTE> This <HI>Elizabeth Oxley</HI> was in Service at the House of one <HI>Mr. Bird,</HI> a noted Attorney in <HI>Fetter Lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</HI> This Girl having dwelt there about six Weeks, on the 10th <HI>April,</HI> 1679, when all the Family were asleep, put Fire in her Master's Cabinet, where there were a great many Papers; and when she thought that the Fire was got beyond extinguishing, she cried out <HI>Fire,</HI> and waked her Master and Mistress. They happily found Means to extinguish the Fire; when that was done, it was discovered that this Creature had made up a Bundle of her own Cloaths, which appeared to have been packed at Leisure, in very great Order; this, added to many other Circumstances, caused a Suspicion, that this Servant had put the Fire on Purpose: She was sent to Prison, and upon Examination own'd all. She said that about <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> in the Year 1678, she became acquainted with one <HI>Nicholas Stubb,</HI> an <HI>English Papist,</HI> who had taken a great deal of Pains to pervert her, and make her change her Religion; when he thought he had persuaded her, to fix her, and make her sensible that she had chosen <HI>the good Part</HI> as well for this World as the other, he several Times said to her. <HI>That she would see all the Protestants in</HI> England <HI>destroyed before the End of the Month of</HI> June, <HI>the next Year;</HI><NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Pag.</HI> 101. <HI>col.</HI> 1. Judy Pelham's <HI>Affidavit concerning</HI> Plummer.</NOTE> <HI>and that all those who would turn Catholiques, should live much more happily than otherwise they could, if they remained Protestants; That after all, it was a meritorious Action to kill an Heretick; and that all the</HI> CATHOLIQUES <HI>would have a Mark

upon their Hats to distinguish them, to the End they might not be massacred with the others.</HI> After many such like Discourses, this <HI>Nicholas Stubb</HI> having learnt that she lodged at this Attorney's House, had often advised her to put Fire to her Master's House, to burn <HI>that Quarter,</HI> promising her for this Action <HI>Five Pounds,</HI> that is to say, 50 or 60 Livres, and gave her Half a Crown earnest: He assured her also, that they would at the same Time se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fire in <HI>several other Quarters</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Town. This Girl being gained by these Promises, promised herself, and did all that they desired.</P>
<P>Upon this Confession of <HI>Elizabeth Oxley,</HI> the Justice caused <HI>Nicholas Stubb</HI> to be taken into Custody; at first he denied all with a brazen Front, but when he was confronted with the Girl, he <HI>could not resist the Force of Truth;</HI> he acknowledged all that <HI>Elizabeth Oxley</HI> had advanced concerning their Dealings and Conspiracies. He added, that he had done it at the Persuasion of <HI>Father Gifford</HI> his <HI>Confessor,</HI> who assured him <HI>there was no Crime in setting Fire to the Houses of Hereticks.</HI> He said further, that there were <HI>two Irishmen</HI> concern'd with him, the one named <HI>Flower,</HI> a Barber, and the other <HI>Roger Clayton;</HI> that they all three usually met in the Dusk of the Evening at <HI>St. James's</HI> in the Fields, to consult Means for putting their Design in Execution; and that <HI>Father Gifford</HI> had promised to the Accused One Hundred Pounds for this Deed. Afterwards this <HI>Nicholas Stubb</HI> related a Thousand Extravagances wherewith <HI>Gifford</HI> buoy'd up their Hopes, and supported the Pro∣mises he made them of a sudden Change in <HI>England.</HI> He told them, <HI>they</HI> would levy a great Army in <HI>England,</HI> there were <HI>Catholiques enough</HI> there for that, and they would draw over a Succour of Sixty Thousand Men from foreign Countries: He added, lastly, that <HI>this Priest</HI> made them <HI>take horrible Oaths</HI> to keep the Secret, and threatned to have them murdered, if they discovered what they knew.</P>
<P>I own I cannot conceive what they can say to inva∣lidate Facts so important, and so well proved: Here are Persons taken in the Fact, and Persons that confess, what would you have more? There is Nothing of which the Hardiness and Impudence of these false Devotees is not capable: Wherefore there is no Doubt but they will devise some new Cheat, and suborne fresh Witnesses to support some new Romance about these frequent Com∣bustions. 'Tis a Matter beyond Example, that a Town should be <HI>set</HI> on Fire as it were every Year; for since the great Fire of <HI>London,</HI> scarce a Year has pass'd but there has been <HI>an hundred</HI> Fires, of two Hundred and Six Hundred Houses: One cannot be persuaded that this was natural. Before we leave this Story of <HI>Elizabeth Oxley</HI> and <HI>Nicolas Stubb,</HI> I wish it may be observed, that this <HI>Nicolas Stubb,</HI> taken up upon the Fact, and committed as an Incendiary, confessed exactly what <HI>Bedlow</HI> had deposed concerning <HI>Father Gifford,</HI> to wit, that it was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> that was the Instigator of these Fires, that they had made Preparation for. <HI>Nicolas Stubb,</HI> the Prisoner accused, convicted, confessing; could he have taken his Confession from the Mouth of <HI>Bedlow,</HI> whom probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had never seen!</P>
<P>The Author of <HI>the Apology for the Catholiques,</HI> makes great Shew of Advantage, because the Lord Viscount <HI>Stafford,</HI> and the other Conspirators who were executed, <HI>persisted to maintain their Innocence to the last,</HI> and <HI>denied there had been any Conspiracy;</HI> wherefore it may be proper to call to mind what Mr. <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eray</HI> says upon the Gun-powder Plot in 1606. It is customary in these Conspiracies to bind the Consciences of those that know these Affairs, with <HI>horrible Oaths.</HI> You may read in [the Book entitled] <HI>Les derniers Effort de l' Innocence affligée.</HI><NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Printed at the</HI> Hague, <HI>Anno</HI> 1682. <HI>Deux<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s Entretien 1.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. beginning pag.</HI> 119.</NOTE> the Form of an Oath which they oblige the Conspirators to take.</P></Q>
<P>[The following Translation from the Book itself, is thus introduced by Way of Dialogue.]</P>
<P>It having been objected, as an Argument of great Weight, that <HI>Persons executed</HI> for these popish Conspiracies▪ persisted <HI>to maintain their Innocence with their last Breath;</HI> the Protestant Lawyer answers.</P>
<Q><P>I am surprized, <HI>Sir,</HI> that you make such a Difficulty about <HI>this obstinate Silence,</HI> we see every Day, Criminals who, to salve their Honour, and to have the Pleasure of saying they die innocent, resist the most violent Tortures; and you don't conceive, that People who have hardened their Courage a long While before, for an Enterprize the most hazardous in the World, should have Resolution to keep 'til Death a Secret whereon depends not only their Honours, but the Preservation of all the <HI>Roman Catholiques</HI> in <HI>England!</HI> If they confess themselves guilty, they must name their Accomplices; and in doing so, they would destroy an infinite Number of People, and render <HI>their</HI> Religion <HI>abominable</HI> in the World, by shewing it is <HI>capable of inspiring such frightful Sentiments,</HI> and to cause such frantick Designs to be hatched. These considerations are of such Force, that <HI>they</HI> alone are capable of supporting the Weakest of Men, to prevent their revealing a Secret of such Importance. When the Powder-Plot was discovered in 1605, not one of the Confederates would confess; and they had known

Nothing from their Mouths, without the Industry of the Judges, who placed <HI>Garnet</HI> and <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll</HI> in two Dungeons from whence they could communicate, and in the Thickness of the Wall there was a Place wherein they put two Witnesses, who could hear every Thing the Prisoners said; by which Means they were forced to own all. Lastly, would you know the <HI>principal</HI> Reason why these Secrets are so well guarded? 'Tis an <HI>horrible Oath</HI> wherewith they bind all those who enter into the like Conspiracies.

Is it then any Thing surprizing, that People (who on the one Hand can <HI>hope</HI> Nothing from their making Confession, since they are condemned to Death, and who <HI>fear</HI> on the other Hand with <HI>the Ruin</HI> of their <HI>Religion</HI> their eternal Damnation) have had the Hardiness to suppress and deny the Truth to the last Moment! We find every Day, that Crimi∣nals who for the Pleasure of saying they die innocent, deny their Guilt at the Gallows; and here they would give us Proof from the Silence and Denial of these People, to which they had persuaded them, that they would be damned eternaly if they let the least Word escape them. All the World knows that <HI>Garnet</HI> and <HI>Oldcorn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who were convicted of the Gunpowder Plot in 1606. persisted in the Denial of it; and if it had not been that they deceived them by the Means above recited, the Jesuits would to this Day have had the Pleasure of proving their Innocence by the same Argument, by which they prove that of the Viscount <HI>Stafford,</HI> and the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> executed.

them suffer, should have had the Power to do that which they had resolved, when we see every Day Criminals condemned, and who have no Hopes at all of Life, resist the most cruel Tortures, and persist 'til Death, to main∣tain their Innocence. 'Tis the Conscience which is to Criminals a Torture of the greatest Efficacy to <HI>force</HI> them to a Confession: So far from the Conscience bringing these <HI>English</HI> Conspirators to a Confession; on the contrary 'twas <HI>that</HI> that kept them from it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they had been persuaded, that they should commit an unpardonable Crime in confessing, and that they would do a good Deed by denying the Truth to their Deaths. It is material to know upon this certain considerable Facts: For Example, that the Confessors and Directors of the Consciences of these wretched Prisoners and Accused, took Care to harden them, either in Person themselves or by some others; that they supply'd with set Forms of Speeches and Protestations of Innocence for the Gal∣lows, those that were not capable of composing any for themselves. There was one found in the Pocket of <HI>Lawrence Hill,</HI> who was executed for having assassinated <HI>Godfrey.</HI> The Executioner, after <HI>Hill</HI> was hanged, amongst many other Papers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pulled out one from his Pocket wherein was written <HI>the dying Speech,</HI> whereof he had recited almost the whole Substance: You will find it a studied Piece, expressed in handsome and strong Terms, whereof <HI>Hill</HI> was not at all capable; for he was <HI>illiterate,</HI> and besides of low Genius.</P>
<P>It is proper to shew it you entire, that you may judge whether it be the Stile and Sentiments of a vulgar Person, or the studied Production of a <HI>Priest</HI> and a <HI>Jesuit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I come now to the fatal Place, where I must end my Life; and I hope I shall finish it with a Courage becoming mine Innocence. I am going presently to appear before the great Judge who knows all Things, and judges justly of every Thing. I hope it will be happy for me a Sinner to suffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o unjust a Death. I call God, Men and Angels to Witness, that I am utterly ignorant of the Manner, the Authors, and Time, of the Murder of Justice</HI> Godfrey. <HI>'Tis nevertheless for this pretended Crime, that by the Malice of some wicked People I am brought to this shameful Death, which I hope will be a ready Passage for me t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eternal Life. In this Hope I dye with Joy, because of mine Innocence, and the Benefit flowing from the precious Wounds of my Blessed Saviour, by whose Merits I hope to obtain Salvation. I dye a</HI> Roman Catholique, <HI>and I desire all those who are of the same Religion to pray to God for my Soul: And I beseech God, in his Justice, that he will please to</HI> detect <HI>the Authors of this horrible Murder, in order that my Innocence may appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> though I heartily forgive mine Accusers, I summon them notwithstanding to appear before the great Tribunal of Divine Justice, as well as those that have put their Hands to this bloody Plot, to answer for the Wrong they have done to an innocent Man: I summon particularly the Lord Chief Justice who presided in this Judgment, and the Brothers of</HI> Edmond-bury Godfrey, <HI>with the Jury, the Witnesses, and all those who have been concerned in this Affair. O Lord, bless and preserve the King; have Pity on this poor Nation, and lay not innocent Blood to their Charge.

<P>That Author goes on,</P>
<P><Q>There is a great deal of Art in this little Speech; but I question, whether <HI>Hill</HI> was in earnest in what he pro∣fess'd. To be more certain that it was not his own Performance, the Paper was shewn to his Wife, who protested it was not his Writing; and in Truth he had not the Use of either Pen, Ink or Paper, all the Time he was in Jail.

<P>The Conformity and Correspondence our own Case bears to the Circumstances and Practices in those afore∣cited, is so obvious, that 'twould be almost needless to remark upon them: But we have a further Particular considerable; That to accommodate themselves to our Circumstances, these Gentry have gone yet one Step further; They ransack'd ancient <HI>Rome, Rome</HI> in its State of <HI>Hea∣thenism,</HI> for a fresh Instance of Barbarity, and have ex∣ceeded them in Villainy, inasmuch as the Meanness of the Submission to confederate with <HI>Negro Slaves</HI> is the more contemptible.<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Tarquin'<HI>s Conspiracy, Universal History,</HI> p. 480.</NOTE></P>
<P>But for this Master-piece they must have very well known, they could entertain no Hopes of setting on foot any such Conspiracy amongst us, from the utter Abhor∣rence the Generality of People here have to their Principles and Practice. Our Slaves being numerous, from the Hopes of their Corruption only must they have flattered themselves with a Prospect of their <HI>Babel:</HI> And indeed, thro' their great Artifice, Cunning and Industry, their Expectations had like to have been too successfully answer'd, had not the Providence of God interposed, confounded their Devices, and brought them to Shame by a Detection, whereby many of their confederates have been delivered into the Hands of Justice, and suffered their condign Punishments.</P>

<P>Here were their Associates, <HI>Whites</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI> detected, confessing their Crimes, some before Conviction, some afterwards, others in the Torments of their Conscience, in Prospect of Flames; some in the Anguish and Bitterness of their Spirits, exclaiming against that <HI>accursed Oath,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound them in this detestable Confederacy, and destined them to that Misery; and yet, as it were, maintaining their Inno∣cence to the last, or at least being silent as to their Guilt.<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot"><HI>This was credibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reported to have slipt from</HI> Ben <HI>(Capt. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) as he was leading to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Stake.</HI></NOTE> others again under actual Sufferings confessing their hainous Crimes, attesting the Truth of what evidenced against themselves, and accusing others, to that time unimpeached, who likewise afterwards confirmed their Testimony by their Confessions.</P>

So fixed and steady were these black Disciples in these bloody Purposes, that one of them who was yet at large, and attending at the Execution of a Confederate at the Stake, was so far from being dismayed at that affrightful Object, that he proposed the present Time to proceed to their Execution, upon observing how many white People were present.<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">York (Marschalk's) <HI>Negro, afterwards hung in Chains by</HI> Hughson, <HI>propos'd this at the Execution of</HI> Quack <HI>and</HI> Cuffee, 30 <HI>May.

<P>But we may remember, that the principal Witness in this <HI>shocking</HI> Case, and happy Instrument of this Detection, was <HI>Mary Burton, Hughson's</HI> indented Servant; who (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow∣ever it was) no one so much as insinuated to have been sworn of the Confederacy. As she was the prime Cause of the Discovery, as before related, their envenom'd Arrows have been chiefly pointed at her; and no Doubt, say they, she must be the Wickedest of Mortals, to bring so many Innocents to this shameful, miserable and untimely End. And what have they to impute to her, sufficient to invalidate her Testimony? Why one Particular, say they, enough to outweigh all: She deposed in her first Examination before the Grand Jury, that she <HI>never saw any white Person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they</HI> [the Conspirators] <HI>talk'd of burning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Town</HI><NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Allow the Expression to import the Conspiracy in general.</HI></NOTE> <HI>but her Master, her Mistress and Peggy.</HI><NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pag.</HI> 13. § 9.</NOTE> 'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she did so, and indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was very ill done; but should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Step preponderate to invalidate her whole Evidence? Much might be said to aggravate this Offence, much also in Extenuation of it. We cannot expect Evidence concerning these Deeds of Darkness, from Witnesses of unblemish'd Characters, free of all Exception. Say she was sworn of the Conspiracy; though it did not appear that she was so; and if it was true, 'twere something strange, one would think, that not a Criminal under Exe∣cution, or otherwise, who confessed their own Guilt and impeached others, should have declared it; but on the Contrary, confirmed her Testimony against themselves in the Torments of Flames, attesting, that <Q>she had spoke the Truth, and could name many more.</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> that her Account of the Conspiracy and Conspirators, given at their Trial was true;<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Quack'<HI>s Confession at the Stake, p. 46. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> 46. § 8.</NOTE> which is the utmost Attestation

that can be to the Credibility of any Person as to the Matter treated of. And if they had known she was engaged in the Conspiracy, from the Resentment they must have borne to her as a principal Evidence in their Conviction, it might have been expected, it would naturaly have bolted out from them; nor did <HI>Sarah Hughson</HI> the Daughter, so much as insinuate it, whose Spleen was very inveterate towards her, as the Cause of their Detection: But perhaps <HI>Hugh∣son'</HI>s Daughter was more artfully instructed, for if it came out, that <HI>Burton</HI> was sworn in a Party, that might add Strength to her Testimony, and fix the Guilt more strongly upon the Parties she accused, by an implied Confession of the most material Part of her Evidence; and if she were not sworn of the Confederacy, it might seem strange to some, that the Conspirators trusted her so much with their Secrets.</P>
<P>There are Allowances to be made, with regard to the special Circumstances this Girl was under in this Case, and some Passions and Qualities which seemed natural to her: She came over young into this Country, an indented Servant, a Year or two before: Her first Master, after some Service, assigned over her Indenture to <HI>John Hughson</HI> for the Re∣mainder of her Term, the Midsummer before this Iniquity broke out, when she was between fifteen and sixteen Years of Age: The Girl thus becoming under the Power of <HI>Hughson,</HI> a Stranger in the Country, and not a Friend to advise with; her Situation was surely somewhat deplorable; for being in the Hands, and under the Influence of so hope∣ful a Family, and held to Secresy by her Apprehensions of the Danger she was beset with, from these Assassins, she might think her Condition helpless, and that she could only wish for Deliverance: She was of a warm hasty Spirit, had a remarkable Glibness of Tongue, and uttered more Words than People of her supposed Education usually do; such a Temper, one might think, could ill brook the Ceremony of attending and serving upon Slaves, and such a Band of <HI>black and white Ruffians;</HI> which, it seems, was the Service enjoined her; neither could <HI>they</HI> think them∣selves safe with her, unless they could seduce her to their wicked Purposes, which they might have Hopes they should compass at last; and tho' at first they might think she was not to be trusted at all Adventures; yet it so happened, that by Degrees, it seems, the Conspirators (as depending upon a Master's Influence over one in her Circumstances, added to the Terrors of their Threatnings to murder her if she made Discovery) flattered themselves they had her sure, and at length became so familiarized and unreserved towards her, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeded not saying, or doing any thing before her; and thus she might be let into their Secrets, upon a Persuasion, <HI>that she durst not tell.</HI></P>
<P>The Girl doubtless must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e under terrible Apprehensions when her Life was thus endangered, both from <HI>Blacks and Whites,</HI> if she made Discovery; this must have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of great Restraint to her, and, in her Hurry and Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion; of Thought, might occasion her to utter that through Inadvertency, which upon calm Reflection, she became conscious was wrong, though at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time, it might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n involuntary Suppression only of Part of the Truth, arising from an Over-hastiness in answering, and want of due Re∣collection; which therefore perhaps, after making all can∣did and ingenuous Allowances, will not be ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ously construed a wilful and deliberate Falshood.</P>
<P>Her natural Volubility and Quickness of Tongue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she not generally spoke the Truth, must unavoidably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> betrayed her into <HI>many</HI> gross Mistakes and Inconsistency but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such Thing but that before mentioned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> observed in the Course of her Evidence, and her Examina∣tions and Depositions were many, besides her Testimony given at the several Trials; her Evidence a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to these, has this Advantage, 'tis confirmed by the whole Current of the Testimony of the other Witnesses, <HI>white and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> as well circumstantialy as principally, as already remarked; and that such a Number of Witnesses examined, and kept apart from each other, should tally so exactly in Circumstances, as well as principal Points of Facts, and their Testimony not be true, is inconceivable!</P>
<P>As to such other White Persons as <HI>Burton</HI> did afterwards accuse, against whom there appeared just or probable Grounds of Impeachment, <HI>viz. Sarah Hughson</HI> the Daugh∣ter, <HI>William Kane,</HI> and <HI>John Corry the Dancing-Master;</HI> concerning the two former, her Testimony affecting them was confirmed by many Negro Witnesses separately exami∣ned, and far enough apart from each other, who not only agreed in the Particulars affecting them, but the most minute Circumstances also relating to the Conspiracy: And though it may be objected, they were not <HI>legal</HI> Witnesses (and therefore had not been admitted to give Evidence on the Trial of any white Person) yet surely their Testimony thus considered together, not only adds Strength to that of <HI>Burton,</HI> but does also amount to the utmost moral Certainty of the Truth of the Facts testified of.—But to put the Matter beyond Dispute concerning them, this <HI>Sarah</HI> and <HI>Kane</HI> confessed their own Guilt, and confirmed (amongst other Things) particularly what <HI>Burton</HI> said affecting themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Kane</HI> himself was first impeached by a Negro, as well as other Soldiers<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Will'<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Confession at the Stake, pag 125. col.</HI> 1.</NOTE> however they became so fortunate as to escape Justice: and this was nevertheless true for it's

coming from a Negro; for <HI>Kane</HI> confessing his Guilt, made also some Attonement by further material Discovery, which squared with the rest of the Evidence; and both <HI>Sarah Hughson</HI> (the Daughter) and <HI>Kane</HI> confirm <HI>Burton'</HI>s Testi∣mony in general, and in particular also that against <HI>Ury the Priest;</HI> and as to <HI>Corry the Dancing-Master,</HI> that he <HI>was</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Conspirators, <HI>Kane</HI> examined apart from <HI>Burton,</HI> testified likewise; so that it may be conceded she only kept back or suppressed, upon her first Examination, Part of that through Dread and Distraction of Thought and Want of proper Consideration, which at the same Time upon due Reflection and Remembrance she might have known to be the Truth, <HI>viz.</HI> that there were other white Persons con∣cerned in the Conspiracy, besides her <HI>Master, her Mistress, and Peggy,</HI> though perhaps they might not all at that Instant have occurred to her Memory; which as to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s Daughter, <HI>Burton</HI> afterwards declared, she did not think of her at the Time.</P>
<P>Thus far then we may venture to infer <HI>Burton'</HI>s Testimony affecting the Persons by her impeached (whose Guilt was manifested by circumstantial and other direct Evidence of Witnesses, in Conjunction with, and Corroboration of hers, and by their own Confessions) was deserving of entire Credit.</P>
<P>We may have observed by the Course of the Proceedings, how these poor Negro Wretches have been deluded by Degrees, and cajol'd to interest themselves, and become Parties in this detestable Enterprize, through the Artifices of Agent <HI>Hughson;</HI> who (though himself a mean illiterate Fellow) from his vicious Propensity, and natural Accuteness, had an Aptitude for Mischief; which <HI>these Craftsmen</HI> made Improvement of, and at length rendered suitable to their abominable Purposes.—Though we cannot suppose that <HI>Hughson</HI> really had the Folly or Vanity to aspire to a King∣dom of the Conspirators erecting; yet the Notion might be calculated and propagated, to captivate the Negroes, (for with none but Fools and Negroes could it take:) And further to please them, it seems they were persuaded, there should be a motley Government as well as motley Subjects; for <HI>Caesar (Vaarck</HI>'s,<HI>)</HI> was to be Governor over free Negroes, who were to marry the Gentlewomen, and <HI>Caesar</HI> had got his white Governess already provided.—If these Phantasms and Delusions could have Force sufficient to en∣snare these simple Creatures (as we find the had) it mattered not how extravagant soever they Folly of the Means was which seduced them to these bloody Purposes, provided they served the Turn and Designs of our Enemies; thereby disappointed the Supply of Provisions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Majesty's Ar∣mament in the <HI>West Indies;</HI> laid Waste this City, destroyed the Inhabitants, and prepared the Way for an Invasion of his Majesty's Enemies, <HI>whether secret or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and <HI>their</HI> making an easy Prey of the whole Province; neither did it signifie how illiterate <HI>Hughson</HI> was, he approved himself sufficiently to his Masters, by his dexterous Prosecution of their Scheme; he did seduce the Negroes in the Manner we have seen; he tempted them to frequent Visits at his House, by his hospitable Entertainments, at such an Expence as 'tis incredible he could have supported for such a Series of Time, as this Mischief must have been brooding, merely upon the Spoils of a few Negroes's Pilferings, and without other private Assistance. It must be allowed he was trusty in his Agency, very industrious, and used no small Craft to encompass a Disciple: In the first Instance, if they were not pre engaged by a Deputy, <HI>Hughson</HI> attempted to make them <HI>swear,</HI> by Forms of Oaths accommodated to their own Customs, by <HI>Thunder and Lightning,</HI> and such like horrible Imprecations, as have appeared in the Course of the Evidence, without telling them what they were to swear to: If they scrupled swearing without further Explanation concerning what; then he intimated, they were to swear to Secresy, that in regard he kept a Publick House, and entertained Negroes contrary to Law, the Intent of the Oath was, that they should not discover him therein; If they agreed to swear at all, 'twas easy to add, (as we find he did) neither should they tell of what they saw going forward at his House: Then upon the main Matter pro∣posed, if they scrupled to engage in the Conspiracy, from any Qualm arising either from the Inhumanity or Wicked∣ness of the Design; they were flattered they were all to be Free-men, and 'twas a meritorious Undertaking: If they thought it would be a Sin; <HI>there was a Priest</HI> that could forgive Sins: If all this would not do, their Lives were threatned if they would not engage, or at least if they discovered any Thing about it: But so apt Pupils were most of them, that the bare Proposal of the Scheme was suffi∣cient to engage them immediately, at all Adventures.</P>
<P><HI>Hughson</HI> artfully engaged in this infamous Project, a Neighbour's Negro, <HI>Jack, (Comfort'</HI>s) a Fellow of most remarkable Craft and Subtlety for one of his Complexion, which qualified him afterwards for a more material Wit∣ness concerning these Deeds of Darkness for <HI>Jack</HI> had more Wit than to be hanged for them. <HI>Jack</HI> was a dignified Man amongst them, a <HI>Captain</HI> of one of these Bands of Fools, had so well approved his Parts and Capacity to <HI>Hughson</HI> and the rest, that he had a Deputation for swearing, as it should seem; for he administered Oaths, to such Converts as he made, either abroad or at home; and in both Cases had great Opportunities of caballing with Negroes; for his Master was frequently absent from home for several Weeks together, insomuch that <HI>Captain Jack</HI> looked upon the House as his own, and himself as his own

<P>We may perceive, that what has been unfolded con∣cerning this Mystery of Iniquity, came out by slow De∣grees; the first Hint concerning the Conspiracy, was given by <HI>Mary Burton</HI> to the Grand Jury, on her Examination the 22d of <HI>April;</HI> and for some time after the Trial of <HI>Hughson, &amp;c.</HI> for aught that had appeared, he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st have been deemed the Projector of it; tho' it had been whispered that <HI>Roman Priests</HI> had been, and that some were then, in Town; no one however cared to discover them, so as they might be laid hold of, and dealt with, as a salutary Law of this Province directs.<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>By Act of Assembly,</HI> II.

<P><HI>Ury the Priest</HI> was looked upon with a very jealous Eye, soon after this Iniquity began to unfold; but no certain Evidence was given concerning him, that he was <HI>such a One,</HI> and at last 'twas Suspicion only that caused him to be taken into Custody: Some Footsteps of others were like∣wise traced, but they were <HI>too artful and cunning,</HI> got out of Reach, left <HI>Ury</HI> the Dog to hold, and sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt their Necks out of that Collar, which was afterwards deservedly placed about his; though he pretended to maintain and protested his Innocence with his last Breath;—<HI>they,</HI> it seems, <HI>were not so fond of this kind of Martyrdom.</HI></P>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> upon the Evidence of <HI>Burton</HI> and <HI>Kane,</HI> who corroborated the Testimony of each other, and <HI>Sarah Hughson</HI> the Daughter's Evidence establishes the Credit of both, as to what they say concerning him; so that the Gentlemen of the Grand Jury which found the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l against him, weighing Matters candidly and ingenu∣ously, saw sufficient Cause to that Time, to credit <HI>Burton'</HI>s Testimony; and to do those Gentlemen Justice, 'twas owing in great Measure, to their good Sense, Discretion, and indefatigable Labours, that this Affair was brought to so happy an Issue; and their painful Service, during a Course of about three Months daily Enquiry, ought to be remembered by this City and Country, with the utmost Gratitude.</P>
<P>But it so happened, That for some Time before this Grand Jury was discharged, there arose great Clamour against <HI>Mary Burton;</HI> for so many Negroes being daily taken into Custody (though not solely through her Evidence, but rather principally upon Discovery made by the Con∣fessions of their <HI>black</HI> Associates already in Custody, and their Testimony corroborated with hers) some People began to be afraid of losing their Slaves; for, as Matters were then like to turn out, there was no guessing where or when there would be an End of Impeachments; every one had Reason to fear their own Negro would be sent for next; and indeed, all Things duly considered, it was most pro∣bable, there were but few of them that were not in the Secret; and the Girl had declared, that there were many Negroes concerned, whose Persons she could or might probably remember, but many whose Names she knew not; so that it should seem, at length some Masters of these Slaves, as well as the Conspirators, endeavoured to bring the Witnesses, and the Notion of a Plot, into Discredit, if perchance it might put a Stop, not only to further Prosecution, but further Enquiry and Discovery also: And these Attempts, luckily for some, had such an Effect, that several Whites, as well as Negroes, escaped Justice, who, had the same Evidence appeared against them a few Weeks before, would scarce have been thought Objects of Mercy; nor, from what we may have observed, would <HI>Mary Burton'</HI>s Evidence have stood single against them.</P>
<P>However, when the first Grand Jury drew near their Discharge, they were importunate with <HI>Burton,</HI> to discover all the Persons she knew to be engaged in this villainous Design; for about this Time she had suggested to some, that there were White People of more than ordinary Rank above the Vulgar, that were concerned, whom if she told of, they would not believe her: This having been inti∣mated to the Grand Jury, they were very pressing with her to discover all she knew, whoever they were; but the Girl stood mute; nor could the Grand Jury prevail with her to name any, not with Threatnings of Imprisonment; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> length, being tired with her Obstinacy, they delivered her over to two of the Judges, requesting them to endeavour to sift the Matter out; but neither, upon Trial, could the Judges by any Means prevail with her to be explicit to them upon the Occasion; she complained (as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she had before done to the Grand Jury) that she had been very ill used; that not only her Life had been threatned by Conspirators of both Complexions, if she made Discovery, but she had also been frequently insulted, and abused by People of the Town, for bringing their Negroes in question, and that People did not believe what she said, and what signified speaking? or to this Purpose she expressed herself; she intimated withal, that there were some People <HI>in Ruffles</HI> (a Phrase as was understood to mean Persons of better Fashion than ordinary) that were concerned, but seemed very unwilling to name any Names; 'til for the last Experiment, she was told, she must expect to be imprisoned in the Dungeon, if she continued obstinate; she then began to open, and named several Persons which she said she had seen at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s amongst the Conspirators, talking of the Conspiracy, who were engaged in it; amongst whom she mentioned several of known Credit, Fortunes, and Repu∣tations, and of Religious Principles superior to a Suspicion of being concerned in such detestable Practices; at which the Judges were very much astonished; others again were imperfectly described by her, whose reputed Religious Profession might square with such wicked Designs, con∣cerning whom the Girl had long before given broad Hints, but said she did not know their Names, or what Part of the City they lived in; but it came out at last, that one of them was a Doctor (a profess'd <HI>Papist,</HI> as common Fame had it) whom she had seen several Times afterwards in the Streets, and who upon Sight of her, always turned another Way, to avoid meeting her: However it was, this Person had the Discretion to remove himself out of this Province soon after; and 'tis said, into foreign Dominions; and it were much to be wished, that such others, as were justly liable to Impeachment, would act with the same Prudence, and follow his Example, for the Sake of their own Safety, as well as the Peace and Security of our selves. But upon the Whole, there was Reason to conclude, that this Girl had at length been tampered withal; might it not be suggested to her, that the Reward offered by Proclamation for the Discovery, she was already sure of; for she was intitled to it; and might she not be tempted to make further Advantage of the Affair? Upon this Supposition, the Conspirators could not have devised a more effectual Means (if they could but prevail with her) to put a Stop to further Enquiry, to procure the Names of Persons to be called in question at last, concerning this Scene of Villainy, whose Fortunes and Characters set them above Suspicion: They
<PB N="205" REF="005413_0213_10173BCC44A97758"/>
very well knew (for <HI>Papists</HI> or <HI>Priests,</HI> as <HI>Ury</HI> intimated, are "<HI>too wise and too cunning</HI>") if they could but prevail in this, they would thereby not only put a Stop to further Discovery, but likewise have some Pretence, according to their usual Custom, to clamour loudly, <HI>there was no Plot at all; 'twas a mere Dream!</HI> And to serve this Turn, they had luckily with them some Owners of Slaves, who hapened to humour this Artifice, though upon a different View.</P>
<P>'Twas fit this Matter should be stated in its proper Light; that on the one Hand the Evidence of this Witness (but for whom next under the Interposition of Divine Providence, this City would in all Probability have been laid waste in Ashes, and many Families massacred) might have its due Weight, so far as deserving of Credit; and on the other Hand, that where she may be justly suspected to have exceeded the Bounds of Truth, there a Stop may be made, to consider, and conjecture, how it might have come to pass, that she told some Things incredible at the Winding up of this Affair; and weigh impartially also, the whole Current of the other Evidence, remarking how it appears to confirm and establish her Testimony, so far as it has been judged proper and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting to publish it.</P>
<P>The other White People executed, as well as <HI>Ury,</HI> like true <HI>modern Romanists,</HI> pretended to maintain (and did protest) their Innocence to their last Breath; though <HI>Hughson</HI> himself, soon after his Conviction, seemed to betray strong Symptoms of his Inclination to confess his Guilt▪ and make Discovery; but if he was in earnest to have done so, in Hopes of saving his own Life, his Mind was soon changed (as 'twas conjectured) by the Persuasion of his Wife; yet <HI>Kerry</HI> left such Proofs behind her of many of the Particulars of this Conspiracy, and of her own Guilt, as add great Force to the aforegoing Accounts of it; and her rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing afterwards, is another irrefragable Instance, how these Wretches do prevaricate, even in their last Moments!</P>
<P>That a Plot there was, and as to the Parties and bloody Purpose of it, we presume there can scarce be a Doubt amongst us at this Time; the Ruins of his Majesty's House in the Fort, are the daily Evidence and Memento of it, still before our Eyes: If the other Frights and Terrors this City was alarmed with, to their great Consternation, are, as to some amongst us, so soon slipt into Oblivion, yet surely others will think we ought once a Year at least, to pay our Tribute of Praise and Thanksgiving to the Divine BEING, that through his merciful Providence and infinite Goodness, caused this inhumane horrible Enterprize to be detected, and so many of the wicked Instruments of it to be brought to Justice, whereby a Check has been put to the execrable Malice, and bloody Purposes of our Foreign and Domestick Enemies, though we have not been able entirely to unravel the Mystery of this Iniquity; for 'twas a dark Design, and the Veil is in some Measure still upon it!</P>

<HEAD>DEPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>ANNE KANNADY, <HI>Wife of</HI> James Kannady <HI>of the City of</HI> New-York, <HI>Peruke-Maker, being duly sworn, deposeth,</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. That on the Tuesday or Wednesday Evening (to the best of her Remembrance) after the Deponent's Husband <HI>James Kannady,</HI> and several other City Officers had been several Times in search at <HI>John Hughson'</HI>s, after the Goods stolen from Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Shop; <HI>Mary Burton,</HI> then Servant to <HI>Hughson,</HI> came to the Deponent's House to buy a Pound of Candles for her Master; and it being a very cold Eve∣ning, the Deponent asked her to come in and warm herself, which she did; and thereupon the Deponent took upon her to ask her several Questions: First of all she asked her her own Name, which she told her as above; for the Deponent did not know it, though she had been several Times at her House upon the like Errands, and she knew that she lived at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s: Then the Deponent asked her, whether that was a black Child or a white Child which that <HI>Irish Beauty</HI> had, which lodged at their House? and she made answer, that it was as white as any of her Chil∣dren, or any other Child. The Deponent then told her, that she heard that there was a Negro who kept Company with her and was the Father of that Child; the said <HI>Mary</HI> answered, there was a Negro came thither to her, but he was not the Father of that Child, she believed: Then the Deponent took upon her to give the said <HI>Mary</HI> good Advice; she told her, she would give her her Blessing as a Mother would a Child, as she was a Stranger in the Country; the Deponent advised her to have no Dealings with Negroes, and to have no Hand in Thievery, for that would be a Means of bringing her to the Gallows.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Deponent then asked her, if she knew any Thing of the Thievery of <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Goods? and she several Times denied that she knew any Thing about the Matter. The Deponent then asked her, if she had a Mind to be freed from <HI>Hughson?</HI> if she had, and would discover the Goods, the Deponent would free her, and she should come and live with her; then the said <HI>Mary</HI> answered, that her Husband (meaning the Deponent's, who had been at <HI>Hugh∣son'</HI>s upon Search, as aforesaid) was not <HI>cute enough:</HI> Then the Deponent said, tell me where the Goods are, and I will take you away from him to Night; she answered, that she would not tell her any Thing to Night, she would tell her To-morrow; but that the Deponent's Husband had trod upon them. Then the Deponent let the said <HI>Mary</HI> return home.</P>
<P N="3">3. That after this Conversation was over, the Deponent the same Evening went to Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> the Under-Sheriff, and told him what had passed as above; whereupon the said <HI>Mills, Mr. Hogg and his Wife,</HI> and several Constables, with the Deponent's Husband and herself, went down to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s House; and the Deponent desired <HI>Mills</HI> to go into the House first, and bring <HI>Mary Burton</HI> out to her; but <HI>Mills</HI> staying a long Time, the Deponent went into the House to him, and found him and his Wife and <HI>Mary Burton</HI> in the Parlour; and there she denied all that she had said to the Deponent as above: Then the Deponent charged her home with it, 'til at last the said <HI>Mary</HI> said, she could not tell them any Thing there, <HI>she was afraid of her Life, that they would kill her:</HI> Whereupon they took her out of the House; and when they had got a little Way from thence, she put her Hand in her Pocket, and pulled out a Piece of Silver Money, which she said was Part of <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Money which the Negro had given her; where∣upon they all went with her to <HI>Alderman Banker'</HI>s; and the Deponent informing him what she had promised the said <HI>Mary, that is to say,</HI> to get her freed from her Master; the <HI>Alderman</HI> directed that she should that Night lodge with the Under-Sheriff at the City-Hall for Safety; and the Deponent wen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the said <HI>Mary,</HI> and left her at Mr. <HI>Mills'</HI>s accordingly.</P>
<P N="4">4. That some time after the said <HI>Mary Burton</HI> was parted from <HI>Hughson</HI> (to the best of Deponent's Remem∣brance, it was after the House in the Fort was burnt) she came to the Deponent's House, and Deponent was talking about the Robbery at <HI>Hogg'</HI>s, and about Butter, Indigo, and Bees-Wax, which had been then lately stolen from other

<P N="6">6. That the said <HI>Mary Burton</HI> further said to this Deponent, that if they had not taken her, the said <HI>Mary,</HI> from <HI>Hughson'</HI>s the Night that they did, she verily believed they (meaning the <HI>Hughsons</HI>) would either have murdered her, or sent her away in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oat by the next S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing.</P></Q>

<P>THE Recorder having been informed by <HI>Mary Burton,</HI> that she had several Times talked to the Wife of <HI>Daniel Masters,</HI> Carman, concerning the Conspiracy, and what she had heard <HI>the Negroes and the Hughsons</HI> often talk about it, whilst she lived at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, and this before the Fire at the Fort; he spoke to <HI>Daniel Masters,</HI> and desired him to send his Wife to him, in order, as he told him, to enquire of her about it; Within three or four Days after∣wards <HI>Susannah Masters</HI> came to <HI>the Recorder,</HI> (viz. this Morning) and he examined her upon the Matter, and took down what she said in the Form of a Deposition, con∣sisting of Twelve Sections or Paragraphs, which she signed and swore to, after hearing the same distinctly read over: the Recorder being obliged to go out, and pressed in Point of Time, he did not examine her so fully as otherwise he would have done; but upon reading over the Deposition in the Afternoon, several other Questions occurred to him, which he thought might be proper to interrogate her upon; therefore he then sent for her again, and she came very readily, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uely answered the Questions proposed to her; Notes were taken at large of the fresh Information she gave; which she was told were to be drawn out in proper order, and added to her Deposition, and the Whole to be fair copied, ready to be read over to her the next Morn∣ing, in order to be sworn and signed; and she promised to come the next Morning for that Purpose; but it may be presumed she had been otherwise advised; for though her Husband had been several times afterwards, ordered to send her again; yet she thought fit to decline coming; the

<P><HI>She said,</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. <HI>That</HI> Mary Burton, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate Servant to</HI> John Hughson <HI>(executed for the Conspiracy) soon after her Removal from her said Master, (upon the Discovery of</HI> Mr. Hogg'<HI>s Goods the last Year, which were stolen and lodged at the said</HI> Hughson'<HI>s House) came to live with one</HI> Wilson, <HI>in the same Street with this Deponent, with whose Family this Deponent was well acquainted, they used to fetch Water at this Depo∣nent's House, and to dry their Cloaths in her Yard; and after</HI> Mary Burton <HI>came to live with</HI> Wilson, <HI>she used often to come to the Deponent's House upon the same Errands, which gave the said</HI> Mary <HI>frequent Opportunities of talking to this De∣ponent; and she said she was glad she was got from</HI> Hugh∣son'<HI>s, to the Place where she now was; for she was afraid there would be Mischief in the Town; for that she knew there used to be</HI> Cabals of Negroes at Hughson'<HI>s whilst she lived there, almost every Night at Supper, and they used to make her wait upon them; and at such Meetings</HI> Hughson and the Negroes <HI>used to talk of</HI> killing the People and burning the Town; <HI>that the</HI> Governor'<HI>s House should be the</HI> first, <HI>and then they would</HI> begin at the Fly, and so go through the whole City; <HI>and that</HI> Hughson's Wife <HI>said, that rather than it should go undone, she would lend an Hand herself; and when all this was done, it was agreed among them, that</HI> Hughson <HI>was to be</HI> King, <HI>his Wife</HI> Queen, Caesar (Vaarck'<HI>s Negro</HI>) Governor, <HI>and</HI> Peggy <HI>his Mistress</HI> Governess.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That</HI> Mary <HI>said, that the</HI> Hughsons and the Negroes <HI>several times threatned her, that if ever she discovered any Thing out of the House, that she heard there, they would certainly make away with her.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That the said</HI> Mary <HI>had discoursed in this manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Deponent three several Times, before she spoke of it to her Husband; but it had made the Deponent very uneasy, though she could not know how to give Credit to it.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That at the Times of this Discourse,</HI> Mary Burton <HI>seemed very uneasy, and used to sit down and cry and bemoan herself, and said,</HI> she was but a young Girl, a Stranger in the Country, and no Friends, and she was in Danger of her Life; <HI>the Deponent th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n asked her, why she did not go to a Magistrate, and make a Discovery of all this?</HI> Mary <HI>an∣swered,</HI> that if she should tell them what she knew, they would not believe her, <HI>as she was a poor Girl and a Stranger.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That upon the Girl's crying and bemoaning herself so to her, the Examinant (considering the Circumstances she was under from the Manner of her relating her Story▪) was very much affected, and could not but take great Compassion of her, as she had no Friends or Relations in this Country to advise with upon her Case, or to protect her; and yet the Examinant says, she would at some times be chearful and merry, and laughing at the Folly of the Conspirators, when she was telling the Examinant of some particular odd Passages which happened at such Nightly Meetings; and that she bore up against the Difficulties she was under, much better than the Examinant could have done in the like Circumstances, and that she thought she had very good Spirits.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That the said</HI> Mary <HI>used further to talk, that when</HI> Hughson and the Negroes <HI>had any Thing extraordinary to do at Nights,</HI> the Hughsons <HI>would send her up to Bed; and that the Night</HI> Hogg'<HI>s Goods came thither, they had sent her up to Bed, and she heard when the Goods came, and she got up and looked out of the Window, and saw the Goods deli∣vered in, but it being dark she could not discover who they were that brought them, for there were many of them, but she heard and knew the Voices of the Negroes</HI> Caesar (Vaarck's) Prince (Auboyneau's) <HI>and</HI> Cuffee (Philipse's)</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>That</HI> Mary <HI>told the Deponent, that the Night</HI> Hogg'<HI>s Goods were stolen,</HI> Caesar <HI>was asleep upon the Table; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he had been drinking very hard, and</HI> John Hughson <HI>came to him about Eleven o'Clock and waked him, and said to him, You forget your Promise, don't you?</HI> Caesar <HI>answered,</HI> No, Sir, I don't, <HI>and thereupon get up and went out; and then</HI> Hughson <HI>sent</HI> Mary <HI>to Bed; and</HI> Mary <HI>said, that upon, this she suspected something extraordinary was to be done, she could not sleep; and she heard the Noise when they brought the Goods, which she took to be about Twelve or One o'Clock.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="5" REF="005413_0219_10173BE1B818CF30"/>
8. <HI>That</HI> Mary Burton <HI>told the Deponent, that she saw the Goods the next Morning; and that</HI> Caesar <HI>offered her as much speckled Linnen before</HI> Peggy, <HI>as would make her an Apron, but she said she would not have it, and threw it down upon the Floor, and told them she did not want it; that want it she did, but that she would not have it in that manner; that she told them she believed they did not come honestly by it; at which she said they were affronted; but she did not value it, she would not receive any Thing of them, if she could but get Victuals, Drink and Cloaths as long as she staid with them, that was all she cared for: That</HI> Caesar <HI>offered her a Piece of Silver, which she supposed was to engage her to look after</HI> Peggy <HI>in her lying in; but she said, No, she would not take care of her and her black Child, but perhaps she might have submitted to have look'd after White People's.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>That at last the Deponent told her Husband of what had passed between her and</HI> Mary; <HI>but at first he thought it was all idle Talk in the Girl, and could not give any Credit to it, and rebuked the Deponent for giving an Ear to her.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>That the said</HI> Mary <HI>further said, That there were many White People, and some</HI> in Ruffles, <HI>that used to come to</HI> Hughson'<HI>s, and go into a private Room with</HI> Hughson; <HI>and if she, when she was bid, brought any Wine or any Thing to the Door of the Room where they were,</HI> Hughson <HI>used to stand ready at the Door and receive it, and send her away again: That these</HI> White People in Ruffles <HI>used to come seldom; but they used to send Letters and Money in them to</HI> Hughson <HI>often;</HI> [for that she has received several Letters brought thither, and has felt Money in them, large round Pieces, which she took to be milled Spanish Pieces of Eight.]</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>That the said</HI> Mary <HI>said, That</HI> Hughson <HI>had a large Parcel of Arms, which he hid under Ground; but she did not know what became of them.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. That the said <HI>Mary</HI> told the Examinant, that <HI>Kannady</HI> the Constable's Wife (at the time that he had been searching at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s in Quest of <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Goods that had been stolen) upon <HI>Mary'</HI>s going to her Shop upon an Er∣rand, advised her, if she knew any Thing of <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Goods, to discover it, or else, she told her, she might be brought into Trouble; and that <HI>Mary</HI> told her, Ah! said she, the Constables in this Place were not half <HI>cute</HI> enough, that they went over them several Times, and had poked a Stick (or Cane she thought she said) into a Place where some of them were (the Examinant apprehended her, that there was some Place in the Stairs that was broken that they were so poking at) and <HI>Mary</HI> said, that she could scarce for bear laughing to see how <HI>dumb</HI> they were, and yet she dared not tell them.</P>
<P>[<HI>Hereupon</HI> Ann Kannady's <HI>proceeding Deposition being read over to the Examinant, she declared,</HI>]</P>
<P N="13">13. That <HI>Mary Burton</HI> had told her what had passed between the said <HI>Ann Kannady</HI> and her the said <HI>Mary,</HI> which to the best of the Examinant's Remembrance, was much to the same Purpose as is related in the said <HI>Ann Kannady'</HI>s Deposition, and that soon after she came to live with <HI>Wilson</HI> as aforesaid, <HI>and before the Fire at the Fort.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>That all the Conversation before related, passed between the Deponent and the said</HI> Mary <HI>concerning the Conspiracy before the Fire at the Fort, and before the Pro∣clamation issued, promising a Reward to such as should make Discovery of any Person or Persons concerned in setting Fire to the Houses.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. That Mrs. <HI>Waldron</HI> who is since married to—<HI>Miller,</HI> coming one Day to the Examinant's House, <HI>before the Fire at the Fort,</HI> Mary Burton being there, she related before her most of the Particulars herein before set forth, much to the same Purpose as before related▪ and the said Mrs. <HI>Waldron</HI> was very much surprized a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>That the Day the Fort was fired,</HI> Mary Burton <HI>came to the Deponent's House, and said to her,</HI> Now you see this is the Beginning of it, Mrs. Masters; they said the Gover∣nor's House should be the first; you did not seem to take much Notice of what I said to you▪ <HI>and</HI> Mary <HI>seemed to be in a very great Fright, and much perplexed, and said, 'twas a thousand Pities it should not be discovered; but says she, if I was to speak what I know of it, they would not believe me, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when she looked upon the Houses, she thought what a Pity 'twas, that they must all come down.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17.

House, before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he went to her Master's; and she seemed to be frightned almost out of her Wits, when she told the Examinant this Story, and said, she looked behind her all the Way, expecting she should be followed and knocked on the Head.</P>
<P N="18">18. That after <HI>Wilson</HI> was removed into the Fly, the said <HI>Mary</HI> told the Examinant, that one Sunday Morning her Master and Mistress being gone to Church, a Negro who she believed did belong to old <HI>Hughson</HI> (Father of <HI>John Hughson</HI> executed) came into her Master <HI>Wilson'</HI>s, Cellar-Kitchen, and asked if there was a Barber there? that <HI>Mary</HI> answered him No; that the said Negro made a Pretence that he wanted to send the Boy out (the only Person in the House besides herself) in order to fetch him a Barber to shave him; but <HI>Mary</HI> said she was afraid he had some ill Design, and would not let the Boy go; and at last, when Church was near out, the Negro went away, and People beginning to come into the Streets, the Negro took to his Heels and run away; and she said she thought to have got somebody to have laid hold of him, but he made too much Haste out of reach: That afterwards she told her Fears and Apprehensions to a Magistrate, and Care was taken to remove her from her Master <HI>Wilson'</HI>s; and she was then lodged again at the Under-Sheriff's at the City-Hall, where she was to remain, and the Corporation purchased her Indentures of <HI>Wilson</HI> for that Purpose.</P>
<P N="19">19. That this Examinant was out upon the Common at the Execution of <HI>Quack</HI> and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> where she met the said. <HI>Mary Burton,</HI> and the Examinant said to her, she wondered how she had Courage enough to be there; she answered, that she knew they had deserved it, <HI>and that if half the Negroes in Town were executed, she believed they had deserved it;</HI> that she knew a great many of them by Sight, but did not know their Names, nor who they belonged to.</P>
<P N="20">20. That when the Governor had ordered a Military Nightly-Watch to be kept in this City, that Evening that <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Store-house was burnt, <HI>Mary</HI> (having been talking to the Examinant about the Conspiracy, and the several Fires which had happened that Day) said, <HI>That was right, and the only Way to prevent further</HI> Mischief.</P>
<P N="21">21. That when several Fires had thus happened, the Examinant was then convinced of the Truth of what the said <HI>Mary</HI> had often before related to her; and the Exami∣nant's Husband resolved to inform, and did inform a Magi∣strate of what <HI>Mary</HI> had told the Examinant, or of the Substance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Examinant's Husband informed her.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING been often interrogated concerning some Discourse I had with the Negro <HI>Bastian,</HI> concerning the Conspiracy; you were pleased to propose to me, that I should recollect myself as well as I could, and set down the Substance of it, by Way of Dialogue; which I have done, according to the best of my Remembrance, <HI>as followeth.</HI></P>
<P>Being at <HI>New-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndon</HI> with my Sloop the Beginning of last <HI>September, Elias Rice</HI> Commander, having <HI>sixteen</HI> Negro Men and <HI>one</HI> Negro Woman on board, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere transported for having a H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd in the late Plot, and have since been delivered at <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> I about that Time received a Letter from my Wife at <HI>New-York,</HI> dated the 31st Day of <HI>August,</HI> 1741. in which Letter she informed me, that one <HI>John Ury</HI> had been executed the Saturday before, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concerned in the Conspiracy; and that it was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of many People, that he was innocent of what had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en alledged against him at Court: This Piece of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> occasioned me to go on Board, to try what I could lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from the Negroes; and I was relating this Account of <HI>Ury</HI> to Captain <HI>Rice, in French,</HI> and <HI>Bastian,</HI> one of the transported Negroes, who attended on Captain <HI>Rice,</HI> being near the Door of the Cabbin within hearing; at my saying, <HI>a great many People thought him innocent,</HI> he seemed to smile, and spoke as if somewhat surprized;

<HI>He innocent!</HI> (says he) <HI>He was one of the Worst of them all.</HI> Upon which I said to him, <HI>Bastian▪</HI> you know all that was to have been done, and you must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me all that you know of the Matter; and he answered that if I would come on board in the Afternoon, he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to me all he knew concerning the Plot; but was unwilling any of the Negroes should hear him. I according to his Request returned on Board in the Afternoon, and taking him privately into the Cabbin, I put the following Questions to him; which without Scruple he answered as I have here penned down, or to the same Effect</P>
<P>Note, <HI>That most of the Conversation was in French,</HI> Bastian <HI>having been bred from a Boy in</HI> Mr. Fauconnier'<HI>s Family, where they chiefly talked that Language.</HI></P>
<SP>
<P><HI>Question. Bastian,</HI> seeing you are now to be transported, and that it hath pleased the Governor to pardon you for a Crime, wherein many of your Associates have suffered Death; you need not fear any dangerous Consequences by giving me an impartial Account of all you know con∣cerning the Negro Plot; tell me all you know of that Affair from the Beginning to the End, without amusing me with any Falshoods; and this you may depend upon, it will in a great Measure, obtain a Pardon likewise from God, for your many and detestable Sins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> Sir, you may depend upon it, that I shall declare to you nothing but what I am very certain of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Who was the first Person that introduced you at <HI>Hughson's?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A. Caesar,</HI> belonging to my Master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> The first Time you were at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s, what did you do there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A, Hughson</HI> himself filled me a Bumper of Liquor, and after having drank it, I found my self quite intoxicated; but I remember he brought me a Book, and bid me lay my Hand on it, and bid me swear, and told me, if I refused it he would kill me upon the Spot; finding myself in so great a Stress, to save my Life I took the Oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What Book was it that <HI>Hughson</HI> made you swear upon, was it a Bible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I don't know what Book it was, but by its make, I thought it looked like those Books you call Bibles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What was it <HI>Hughson</HI> obliged you to stand to, and after what Manner did you swear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By Lightning and Thunder, and by Hell-Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, that I would set fire to whatever I came across, and destroy as many Whites as I could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What did you propose to do, if in case you had got the upper Hand of the Whites; did <HI>Hughson</HI> make you any Promise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He promised to make us all free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did there generally use to resort many Negroes at <HI>Hughson's?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; for I have been there many a Time when I have told Fifteen, often Twenty, and sometimes Thirty Negroes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you use to eat and drink there, whenever you went to see Hughson?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We always had a good Supper, and never wanted for Liquor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> The Night after the Fort burnt, did you return to <HI>Hughson'</HI>s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; but the Night after that we were a jolly: Company, and had a fine Supper prepared for us, and seem'd all of us to be well pleased with our late good Success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you know any Whites that were concerned with you? Did you ever see any at <HI>Hughson's,</HI> at your Meetings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I have seen <HI>Will Kane</HI> there very often, and two or three <HI>Soldiers</HI> whom I knew not, and another <HI>little</HI> Man who was also a Stranger to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was that <HI>little</HI> Man young or old? of what make was he? and how did he employ his Time among you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He was far from being a tall Man, but short, very lean, and a pale Visage; nor was he old; his Place was at the upper End of the Table; he often encouraged us to remain firm, like Men, in our Designs: He read and wrote a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you know what he wrote?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I have seen him take the Names of the Negroes down, from time to time, by Way of List.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But how could <HI>Hughson,</HI> who was but a poor Man, support so great an Expence at his House? there were Suppers every Night for you all, Candles, and many other Things, the Charge of which must have been very great: This goes beyond my Comprehension; for you know the Person who wrote so much, must have had Lights to see; I say, I do not know how he did to support all that Charge!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Negroes brought what they could steal to him; the White Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> speak of was <HI>short-sighted,</HI> and never wrote or read without Spectacles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> They say he was a Romish Priest; do you know any Thing about that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I don't know that he was a <HI>Priest;</HI> but he used to <HI>exhort us like a Minister,</HI> to continue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in our Inten∣tions, and used to throw his Hands about like a Preacher; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said to us at the Meeting at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s the second Night after the Fort was burnt, <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w God has prospered us in the Beginning, in burning the Fort, and we need not fear;
<PB N="8" REF="005413_0222_10173BEB1CD56C88"/>
we must be resolute, and proceed in the Work, and no Doubt God will prosper us in all; That the Town was too much alarmed at present; but they must go on when the fine Weather came; That they (the Negroes) need not fear, he would forgive them their Sins if they kept true to their Engagements, and by and by the</HI> Spaniards <HI>would come, and then they should be free.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Have you been baptized by that <HI>little</HI> Man, they called a Priest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; but I have been told by some Negroes of our Company, that the <HI>little</HI> Man had baptized them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is it true, you were to burn the <HI>English Church?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, we agreed to burn it last Winter; but the Man whom you call <HI>a Priest</HI> opposed it, and advised us to stay till Spring, when there would be a larger Congregation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Your Intentions then were to destroy all the Whites while they were in the Church; how were you to go about it? had you Arms? and could you think otherwise but that many would have made their Escape thro' the Doors and Windows? Explain me these Things as well as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We had Combustibles prepared by <HI>Doctor Harry,</HI> made up into Balls, which we were to set fire to, and throw them upon the Roof of the Church, which sticking fast would set fire to the Shingles; after which, guarding the Doors, we were to let none pass, but destroy them all in the Church with our Fire-Arms; for we had a great Number of them at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Where did you use to keep your Arms at <HI>Hughson'</HI>s? for when the Searchers were sent there, they were not to be found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I believe not; for the Plot beginning to come to Light, <HI>Hughson,</HI> to secure himself, had them all thrown into the River; before that they were hid in a Hole in the Cellar.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Bastian</HI> further declared, that he had not seen the Person they called <HI>a Priest,</HI> since he came into Jail.</P>

<HEAD>The INFORMATION of John Williams of the City of New-York, Baker, touching the Confession made to him by Will (Ward's Negro) executed for the Con∣spiracy.</HEAD>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. That the Day Mr. <HI>Philipse'</HI>s Store-house was fired, and there was an Alarm that the Negroes were rising, he thereupon went home to get his Arms in Readiness, and to secure his House and Family; and as he had conceived a great Jealousy of <HI>Ward's Will,</HI> he called at his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and asked him, where this Negro was, in order that he might have him in sight, and secure him; <HI>Ward</HI> answered he was back in the Kitchen; and he calling him sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Times, <HI>Will</HI> at last answered out of the Garret: He was ordered down, and <HI>Williams</HI> commanded him to keep upon his Master's Stoup, within his Sight, and told him if he offered to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir from the Door, he would shoot him; <HI>Williams</HI> having at the same Time a Gun in his Hand; and there he accordingly remained 'til the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rry was over.</P>

boarded with her and her said-Mother) said to her, <HI>Aunt Nancy, my Mammy Campbell used to boil Chocolate every Morning, but used to give me Suppan, and sometimes Chocolate with it:</HI> Whereupon <HI>Ann Lyng</HI> asked him, who used to eat the Chocolate? he answered, <HI>his Daddy Campbell</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>So the Child used to call him; he boarded, and went to School to him, before he came to</HI> Ann Lyng.</NOTE> <HI>and Mr. Ury used to eat the Chocolate;</HI> Then she asked him if he knew <HI>Ury?</HI> he answered, <HI>Yes, very well; for he used to be by, when his Daddy Campbell and</HI> Hughson <HI>used to play upon a Board with little Pieces of Wood upon it; she then asked him if he knew Hughson? he said, very well; he was a tall Man, with a thin Face, used to wear a red Coat, and a white Cap; that he often came to his Daddy</HI> Campbell's, <HI>but always at, Night; that he knew</HI> Ury <HI>well, he used to teach him his Book sometimes, and was a very little Man, and lodg'd sometimes at his Daddy</HI> Campbell's.</P>
<P>Mrs. ROSS <HI>declared,</HI> That upon her said Daughter's telling her what <HI>Jemmy</HI> had said, as above, she asked him Questions much to the above Purpose; and the Child declared over again to the same Effect.</P>
<P>Then the Boy was asked some Questions by the Recorder and Town-Clerk, tending to the same Purpose, concerning his knowledge of <HI>Hughson</HI> and <HI>Ury▪</HI> and he described them as above, and said, <HI>they used often to be together at his Daddy</HI> Campbell'<HI>s, and his Daddy</HI> Campbell <HI>and</HI> Hughson <HI>used to play at Chequers,</HI> or Draughts, [as they understood, according to the Child's Description; for he was put in Mind of it, it seems, by <HI>Ann Lyng'</HI>s Child having some Beans given i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which it was playing w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and throwing about the Floor,] <HI>and that</HI> Ury <HI>used to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by, and looking at them, and used to say, Now</HI> Campbell <HI>you will win, and, now</HI> Hughson <HI>you will win.</HI></P>
<P>The Child also described the Persons of <HI>Hughson</HI> and <HI>Ury</HI> very exactly, and said, Ury <HI>used to wear Spectacles, and made Punch for</HI> Hughson <HI>and</HI> Campbell, <HI>whilst they were playing.</HI></P>
