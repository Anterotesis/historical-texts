<HEAD>An Addition To the Present Melancholy Cir∣cumstances of the PROVINCE Considered, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> March 6th. 1718, 9. Exhibiting Considerations about Labour, Commerce, Money, Notes, or Bills of Credit.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LABOUR</HI> is needful in order to our comfortable Living in the World. Inasmuch as we consist of <HI>Material Bodies,</HI> as well as <HI>Rational Im∣mortal Souls.</HI> Our Constitution is such, that <HI>Houses</HI> to dwell in, <HI>Food</HI> &amp; <HI>Raiment</HI> are needful for our Subsistance; <HI>Houses</HI> are usually made of <HI>Wood, Stone, Brick, Lime,</HI> or partly of them all; <HI>Nails, Hinges, Glass</HI> for Lights, &amp;c. are also used in making a comfortable Habitation; Now its obvious to every think∣ing Person, that much <HI>Work or Labour</HI> (as well as <HI>Cost</HI>) is needful to <HI>fit &amp; prepare</HI> these <HI>Materials,</HI> to collect and get them together (some are often <HI>Transported</HI> very far▪) and also to <HI>joyn</HI> and put them together; Hard <HI>La∣bour</HI> is absolutely necessary, in <HI>Building</HI> a <HI>Convenient Dwelling;</HI> and often also in keeping it in <HI>good repair,</HI> that thro' the <HI>Idleness of the hands the House may not drop through.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002010_0002_0FBA7CE9DC391900"/>
<HI>Labour's</HI> as needful to procure <HI>Food</HI> for our Bodies. As to the <HI>Grain,</HI> our <HI>Bread</HI> is made of, whether <HI>Wheat, Rye, Indian Corn,</HI> &amp;c. how much <HI>Labour</HI> is there to <HI>Fence</HI> &amp; <HI>Plow</HI> the Ground, <HI>Sow</HI> or <HI>Plant</HI> the <HI>Seed, tend</HI> it, <HI>reap</HI> or <HI>gather</HI> it, <HI>Thresh, Grind, Bake</HI> it before it becomes <HI>Bread?</HI> The <HI>Flesh</HI> we eat, whether <HI>Beaf, Pork, Mutton,</HI> &amp;c. how much <HI>Labour</HI> is there to <HI>Raise, Tend, Feed Cattle, Hogs, Sheep,</HI> before their Flesh becomes proper Food for us? As to <HI>Fish</HI> though we are at no pains to <HI>raise</HI> them, yet we are to <HI>catch</HI> them, with <HI>Hooks, Nets,</HI> &amp;c, and often to <HI>spirt, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, dry</HI> them be∣fore they are fit for our <HI>Food,</HI> or at least fit to be <HI>kept</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time without <HI>rotting</HI> and perishing. So as for <HI>Roots, Turnips, Parsnips, Carrets,</HI> &amp;c. And as for <HI>Orchard Fruits, Apples, Pears, Peaches,</HI> &amp;c. much <HI>Work</HI> &amp; <HI>Labour</HI> must be imployed, to produce such Things as these for the nourishment of our Bodies.</P>
<P><HI>Labour's</HI> also as needful to procure <HI>Cloaths;</HI> the great∣est part whereof is commonly made of <HI>Sheeps Wool, Cot∣ton Wool, Flax, Hemp, Silk</HI> (that's first Spun fine by the <HI>Worms) Skins</HI> of Beasts for <HI>Shoes, Gloves,</HI> &amp;c. As to Sheep there's <HI>Labour</HI> to <HI>raise, tend, feed</HI> them Winter and Summer before their <HI>Wool</HI> is come to its full growth, and then, how much <HI>Labour</HI> in <HI>washing, shearing, card∣ing, combing, spinning, weaving</HI> (or <HI>knitting) fulling, making</HI> before we put it on our Bodies to <HI>wear?</HI> As to <HI>Flax</HI> there is Labour in <HI>sowing, pulling, dew-rotting,</HI> or <HI>water-rotting, breaking, hatchelling, spining, weaving,</HI> &amp;c. before we use it for <HI>Cloathing.</HI></P>
<P>These few and brief Hints plainly show, that much <HI>Work</HI> or <HI>Labour</HI> is absolutely necessary to our comforta∣ble Living in the World. The Wise Creator and Gover∣nour of all things has <HI>fitted</HI> and <HI>adapted</HI> Man for <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Business,</HI> besides the rational Endowments of his Immortal Soul, he has <HI>Feet</HI> for walking &amp; <HI>Hands</HI> for working; that when <HI>the Sun ariseth, he may go forth to his work &amp; labour till the evening: he should work</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002010_0003_0FBA7CEDE6F76EF0"/>
<HI>while it is day.</HI> As God has <HI>fitted</HI> Man for <HI>Work,</HI> so he has rendred his <HI>working</HI> absolutely needful for his own <HI>Support</HI> and <HI>Comfort;</HI> and has likewise said, <HI>Six Days shalt thou labour, and do all they work: Do your own business, work with your own hands that ye may have lack of nothing; if any will not work neither should he eat.</HI></P>
<P>These Things being so, I dont see how we can possi∣bly excuse our selves, or have solid peace in our own Breasts, if we indulge our selves in <HI>Idleness.</HI> If some have such <HI>Estates,</HI> that the <HI>Yearly Income's</HI> enough to maintain them, yet since they have the <HI>same Powers</HI> and Capacities for <HI>Business,</HI> and are under the same <HI>Supream Law</HI> with others, they seem inexcusable if they <HI>wrap up their Talent in a Napkin,</HI> for they should be <HI>good Stewards</HI> of the Abilities betrusted with them. The greater Estates they have, the more they're indebted to Divine Providence, and should make grateful returns by vertuously imploying betrusted Abilities; yet as they have <HI>opportunity they may do good to all Men,</HI> and be∣come more able <HI>to give to him that needeth.</HI> But <HI>Idle∣ness</HI> seems to be a double aggravated crime in those, whose honest Incomes can't maintain them. If they <HI>can Work</HI> and <HI>won't,</HI> they may well be counted <HI>Publick Nu∣sances,</HI> for in the <HI>Victuals</HI> they eat and <HI>Cloaths</HI> they wear, they really live on the <HI>Labour of others,</HI> yet make them no recompence for it: whether this may be styled <HI>open Injustice</HI> or <HI>secret Theft,</HI> I'll leave to the ingenious co decide. God's <HI>Authority</HI> and Mens own <HI>Necessities,</HI> makes <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> absolutely necessary for them. Therefore Children should be Educated (not only in re∣ligious Learning but also) to <HI>good Business,</HI> for they should <HI>be trained up in the way wherein they should go. Idleness</HI> should be indulged by none, but <HI>Diligence</HI> in proper Business, (which by God's Blessing makes rich) should be ezemplifyed in all; the more there is of such <HI>Diligence</HI> among a People, so much the more 'tis (or∣dinarily) for their own Support and Comfort. So far as
<PB N="4" REF="002010_0004_0FBA7CEF322E6F80"/>
we are thus <HI>Industrious</HI> we are obedient to God, profitable to our selves, useful to our Neighbours, advantagious to Posterity, but <HI>Idleness</HI> is the <HI>reverse</HI> of all these. If <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Interest</HI> wont, I believe <HI>pressing, pinching necessity</HI> will make some more <HI>industrious</HI> than they used to be. Yet to prevent mistakes, I'll say, there is a great variety of Work needful for the good of Hu∣mane Persons and Societies; besides <HI>Plowing, Hewing</HI> or an <HI>immediate laborious working with the bands.</HI> The studying of <HI>Languages, Arts, Sciences, Divinity, Physick,</HI> &amp;c. and the employing the skill or knowledge obtained by such Study, may greatly promote the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> the <HI>Persons own benefit,</HI> and the good of those he is con∣cerned with. This is true as to <HI>Ministers, School-Masters, Physicians,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>From these Hints about LABOUR, we pass to consi∣der something about COMMERCE, by which I here understand all manner of <HI>Exchange</HI> in dealing; whether we Exchange <HI>Money</HI> for <HI>Goods, Victuals, Labour,</HI> or Exchange one sort of Goods for another, or Labour either for Labour or Wages. All such Exchange I here com∣prehend under the name of <HI>Commerce,</HI> and such Com∣merce is absolutely necessary for the good of Humane Societies. Tho' an <HI>House, Food, Raiment,</HI> are needful for my comfortable Subsistence, yet I can't be supposed to be equally skilled in making, raising, and providing these various and different necessaries. A Great variety of <HI>Arts, Skill, Labour,</HI> and a great number of Persons is ss needful ordinarily, to furnish so much as one Person with what is proper, for his <HI>Habitation, Food</HI> and <HI>Rai∣ment.</HI> Such is the scanty narrowness of our Capacities, that generally much Use, Habit, Custom is needful to render a Person truly skilful or accurate at any one sort of Business. Common sayings declare, that <HI>Use makes perfect. Experience is the best School-Master.</HI> Studious Diligence in a <HI>Particular Calling,</HI> generally makes a Person skilful at it; the more Skilful, so much the faster
<PB N="5" REF="002010_0005_0FBA7CF1E7B8F200"/>
and better he can Work. The better he Works, so much the more profitable to him that buys and pays; and the faster he Works or the more he does, so much the more profitable 'tis for himself.</P>
<P>Every Person therefore should endeavour to be Skilful and Accurate at some suitable and proper Work or Business. that thereby he may be able to manage an honest <HI>Commerce</HI> with his Neighbours, and may make a just recompence for the various benefits he receives from them. For instance, if a <HI>Shoe-maker</HI> with the <HI>Shoes</HI> he makes, honestly pay one for the <HI>Leather,</HI> another for the <HI>Thread</HI> he works up, another for the <HI>Food</HI> his Family eats, another for the <HI>Cloaths</HI> they wear, &amp;c. herein he manages an honest <HI>Commerce</HI> &amp; <HI>Exchange</HI> with those he is supplyed or benefited by. Or if he Sells his <HI>Shoes</HI> for an honest price in <HI>Money,</HI> &amp; with that Money pays particular Persons he deals with, and also Publick dues to <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> &amp;c. herein still he manages an <HI>honest Commerce.</HI> And I think some <HI>Commerce</HI> of this general Nature, must be managed by every one that would live honestly. When do we eat one <HI>mouthful of Bread,</HI> or put on any <HI>Rai∣ment</HI> whether <HI>Woolen</HI> or <HI>Linen,</HI> but that several Scores of different Persons have been imployed more remotely or immediately, to raise and prepare the same for our use? And when the Labour of so <HI>many</HI> is imployed for <HI>my</HI> benefit, if <HI>my</HI> Labour (or the produce of it) be not immediately or remotely an equivalent benefit to them, I am then unjust and dishonest to them; for why should I be benefitted by their <HI>Labour,</HI> without making a just return in being some way or other as serviceable to them as they are to me? If we (being able) do'nt do at least as much good to Mankind, as we receive from them: then we are Debtors to our Neighbours, and unjust in our Conduct to them.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as we should desire to benefit others, as well as be benefitted by them; therefore we should not Sell our Labour or the produce of it, for more than 'tis
<PB N="6" REF="002010_0006_0FBA7CF4D6FF19A8"/>
worth, according to the Rules of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Equity:</HI> nor should we desire to have our Neighbours Labour, or the produce of it, for <HI>less</HI> than the <HI>just Value</HI> of it. Therefore to Sell as high or dear, and Buy as cheap or low, as possibly we can, is no good Rule for Christians to go by: <HI>for we should love our Neighbours as our selves, &amp; do as we would be done by.</HI></P>
<P>Among the many <HI>Products</HI> of <HI>Humane Labours</HI> some are looked on as <HI>necessary;</HI> others as being chiefly for convenience, ornament or delight. It's as plain that we should prefer <HI>Necessaries</HI> to what is only for Ornament, or to please the fancy. <HI>Raiment</HI> is necessary for us, tho' this or that particular <HI>Mode, Cut, Fashion</HI> or <HI>Trimming</HI> is not so. Its criminal therefore if thro' <HI>Idleness</HI> we neglect to provide necessaries for our selves, or Families; its criminal also, if we employ so much of our <HI>Labour</HI> or the <HI>Produce</HI> of it, in getting Things for Ornament or Delight, as to pinch or straighten our selves as to <HI>Ne∣cessaries;</HI> or render us unable to pay our just Debts. On the other hand, it's more noble to be employed in serv∣ing and supplying the necessities of others, than meer∣ly in pleasing the fancy of any. The <HI>Plow-Man</HI> that raiseth Grain, is more serviceable to Mankind, than the <HI>Painter</HI> who draws only to please the Eye. The <HI>hungry</HI> Man would count fine Pictures but a mean Entertain∣ment. The <HI>King himself is served by the Field.</HI> The <HI>Carpenter</HI> who builds a good <HI>House</HI> to defend us from Wind and Weather, is more serviceable than the curious <HI>Carver,</HI> who employs his Art to please the Fancy. This condemns not Painting or Carving, but only shows, that what's more substantially serviceable to Mankind, is much preferrable to what is less necessary. Doubtless <HI>Nebuchadnezzers</HI> Politick's led him to think so, when to <HI>weaken the Jews,</HI> he carried from them not only the <HI>Princes</HI> &amp; <HI>Mighty Men of Valour,</HI> but also the <HI>Carpen∣ters</HI> and <HI>Smiths</HI> whose Occupation was very necessary &amp; useful to humane Society.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002010_0007_0FBA7CF7245719C0"/>
Indeed when a People <HI>grow numerous,</HI> and part are sufficient to raise necessaries for the whole, then tis al∣lowable and laudable, that some should be imployed in <HI>Innocent Arts</HI> more for <HI>Ornament</HI> than <HI>Necessity:</HI> any innocent business that gets an honest penny, is better than <HI>Idleness.</HI> If some do <HI>nice, curious</HI> works in <HI>Gold, Sil∣ver, Brass, Iron, Linnen, Silk</HI> &amp;c. and others whose Estates will bear it pay them for their <HI>Labour</HI> and buy what they make, this is much better for the <HI>Publick,</HI> than that any should be idle: This yields the greatest satis∣faction to me, as to many unnecessary Niceties and Curi∣osities in <HI>building, adorning furnishing</HI> of <HI>Houses,</HI> in making fine <HI>costly Gardens, Cloaths</HI> &amp;c. that hereby the <HI>Poor</HI> are <HI>imployed</HI> and <HI>maintained,</HI> when they could scarce <HI>find work and get a living;</HI> if no business was done amongst mankind, but what is in its own nature ne∣cessary to provide <HI>Habitations, Food</HI> and <HI>Raiment:</HI> If the Rich thus pay for such needless Curiosities, chiefly to <HI>imploy and maintain</HI> the <HI>Poor,</HI> its noble and generous in them, better than if they had given them the Cost thereof for nothing: but if chiefly to gratifie their own <HI>pride,</HI> its <HI>criminal in them.</HI> Yet observe, if we are rich and able; its better to imploy and maintain the <HI>Poor</HI> among <HI>our-selves,</HI> than those in <HI>forreign parts.</HI></P>
<P>And we had better give something to those that cant work, and to educate <HI>poor Children</HI> &amp;c, than to be lavish in buying of needless curiosityes for our-selves.</P>
<P>But truly our Country is not yet of that <HI>Age,</HI> Peo∣ple not so numerous, nor we in such plentiful circum∣stances, as to require that many (if any) should be im∣ployed in niceties and curiosities. Tho' God has given us a good Land, a very good Countrey for those that will be industrious, yet it is a <HI>Northern Climate,</HI> the winter so long and cold, as to make much diligent Labour ne∣cessary to provide <HI>Dwelling, Food</HI> and <HI>Raiment,</HI> tho' curiosities are neglected. We should therefore Exercise our-selves, and incourage one another in imployments
<PB N="8" REF="002010_0008_0FBA7CF895723C00"/>
directly tending to supply our necessities, and promote our comfortable subsistance.</P>
<P>In <HI>Commerce</HI> to be managed by a <HI>private Family,</HI> do's not prudence direct us, that we should sell or part with what we can best spare, and receive by way of exchange for it, what is most needful for us? If we receive mo∣ney that answers all things procurable by commerce; if we can't get that, we should firstly aim at whats most <HI>serviceable</HI> rather than at <HI>curiosities.</HI> And I pre∣sume the same rules hold good, as to <HI>Commerce</HI> between one Countrey and another. I suppose this Province doth not raise nigh so much <HI>Provisions</HI> as is needful to feed our-selves, and supply our <HI>Shipping,</HI> we buy much from other places, while so, would it not be an hurt to send any <HI>Provisions</HI> to a <HI>Forreign Market?</HI> But out of the produce of our Labour, we may spare great quan∣tities of <HI>Fish, Oyl, Whalebone,</HI> &amp;c. and for these, what returns should we chiefly desire? Why things that are most serviceable and necessary for us, and not for needless Commodities, sundry of which were glanced at in the Letter <HI>March 6th.</HI></P>
<P>And I think least of all should we desire so much <HI>Rum</HI> as is spent here. These <HI>Northern Plantations</HI> on the Continent, are great sufferers by the vast quantities of <HI>Rum</HI> spent among them. Tho' in some cases it may be useful <HI>medicinally,</HI> yet I have no reason to think that 'tis proper for any, to make an usual <HI>drink</HI> of it if the <HI>Excise</HI> were so raised, that it could not be retailed under Ten Shillings a Quart, I believe it would be ten times better for this <HI>Province</HI> than it is. If the high price might restrain many of the poor labourers, from getting <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Flip;</HI> I believe their needy Families would be much better provided for than they are. Don't some say, that when Men drink so much, they drink the blood of their Wives and Children; that is, they waste the cost which should provide necessaries for their Families.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Labourers</HI> in my Family spend one fortnight
<PB N="9" REF="002010_0009_0FBA7CFB1FFD83A0"/>
(I'll suppose) in a year, to get <HI>Hoops</HI> or <HI>Staves</HI> for a West India Market; and we spend the returns of it in <HI>Rum,</HI> this would be but a miserable <HI>Commerce</HI> for my Family. We could have done well enough without the <HI>Rum,</HI> and if that Fortnights Labour had been spent in raising <HI>Grain,</HI> there would have been a better supply of Necessaries; if in raising <HI>Flax</HI> or <HI>Hemp,</HI> we might be employ'd in the Winter in dressing it; instead of spending our Time and burning our Skins over our <HI>Drams.</HI></P>
<P>I'm humbly of the Opinion, that multiplying of <HI>Taverns, Licences</HI> to Retail Drink, and the Drinking so much <HI>Rum,</HI> have been unspeakably hurtful to this Province, and if not speedily retrenched will evidently hurt and impoverish us much more. If the needless cost in <HI>Rum</HI> in a few Years past were computed, would it not amount to as much as the Inhabitants of the Province have taken up upon their Lands? If that cost in <HI>Rum</HI> had been spared, might not this Mortgaging their Lands have been in some measure prevented? If any ingenious Person could pretty fully inform the Publick, how much <HI>Rum</HI> is Retailed and Spent in this Province in One Year; it might possibly give to some a new view of things, and make them more careful to prevent or suppress what threatens us.</P>
<P>The Order that I proposed, requires that I should nextly say something about MONEY. And by this I principally mean &amp; intend, <HI>Gold</HI> or <HI>Silver</HI> that has some <HI>Mark</HI> or <HI>Stamp</HI> on it by <HI>Publick Authority,</HI> shewing it to be Legal and Current Coin, whether it passeth by Tale or Weight. Tho' I conceive what passes by <HI>Tale</HI> is supposed to have such a <HI>Weight</HI> as the Law prescribes for it, as <HI>Crowns, Shillings,</HI> &amp;c. As for such <HI>Silver &amp; Gold Money,</HI> I think it is Universally esteemed by all Civilized Nations, has been so in all Ages; and is reckoned the best <HI>Medium of Trade</HI> or <HI>Exchange,</HI> by all that are much used in Buying and Selling.</P>
<P><HI>Money's</HI> more durable than Eatables, Drinkables and other Commodities which Person often Exchange with
<PB N="10" REF="002010_0010_0FBA7CFC40199E98"/>
one another. In <HI>Silver</HI> &amp; <HI>Gold</HI> a great Price or Value may be contained in a small Compass, a small Quantity: a small handful of <HI>Money</HI> may buy Cart-Loads of some other things that are yet very useful for us. <HI>Money</HI> also is easy of <HI>Transportation,</HI> a great Value may be easily Transported by Land or Water. These considerations render <HI>Money</HI> very Commodious and Useful in <HI>Trade</HI> or <HI>Commerce. Gold</HI> &amp; <HI>Silver</HI> are reckon'd to have an <HI>in∣trinsick Value</HI> in them, and sometimes they are used to make <HI>Rings, Jewels, Spoons, Cups,</HI> &amp;c. but <HI>Money's</HI> chiefly useful to Men, as its the most convenient Medium of Exchange or Commerce. The Wise Man says, <HI>Money answers all things.</HI> If a Man has <HI>Money</HI> enough, he may buy <HI>Food</HI> and <HI>Raiment,</HI> any thing for <HI>Necessity</HI> or <HI>Delight,</HI> that's attainable by Commerce. Generally, Men had rather have <HI>ready Money</HI> than any thing else, for what they Sell; and <HI>Money</HI> will more readily Buy what's wanted, than any thing else will. This proceeds from the Universal Value and Esteem, which Men have for <HI>Money.</HI> It's true, <HI>The love of Money is the root of all Evil; Coveteousness is Idolatry;</HI> if we take such <HI>Cor∣ruptable Things as Silver and Gold for our chief trea∣sure;</HI> if we make <HI>Gold our hope, &amp; fine Gold our Confidence;</HI> I say, to do this, must needs be criminal, provoking to God and hurtful to our selves; yet the U∣niversal Esteem Men have for <HI>Money</HI> (if it be not ex∣cessive) seems to be a favour and benefit of God to Man∣kind; because thereby it becomes an Universal Medium of Exchange or Commerce. If a Man has Forty diffe∣rent things to buy, and <HI>Money</HI> enough; 'twill buy them all as readily or more readily, than if he had Forty sorts of Commodities to part with for them. There's an Esteem of <HI>Money</HI> which is lawful not vicious; when its valued as the best Medium of Trade or Exchange. Such an Esteem of it <HI>Abraham</HI> had, when he offered <HI>Money</HI> to buy a Burying Place; and <HI>Jacob,</HI> when he sent <HI>Money</HI> to <HI>Egypt</HI> to buy Corn in a time of Famine; and <HI>David</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="002010_0011_0FBA7D00852EB8A0"/>
when he offered <HI>Money</HI> for a Spot of Ground to build an Altar on. <HI>Money</HI> being the best, most approved Universal Medium of Exchange; the more plenty there is of it among a People, the more easily they may ma∣nage all their Affairs of <HI>Trade</HI> or <HI>Commerce.</HI> If a Man can have <HI>ready Money</HI> for what he doth, or Sells, and his <HI>Money</HI> will Buy what he has occasion for, this renders the management of his Affairs very easy, to what other∣wise 'twould be. A Bartering <HI>Trade</HI> is very troublesome, tho' sometimes needful for want of <HI>Money.</HI> It was one of the great Outward Blessings of King <HI>Solomons</HI> Reign, that <HI>Money</HI> was very plenty among his People.</P>
<P>Inasmuch therefore as the <HI>Export</HI> of this Conntry, must necessarily exceed what we spend of Imported Com∣modities, in order to the making <HI>Money</HI> pass Current among us; it must needs be wise in us, to Spend as little as need requires of Imported Goods, and to Raise, Make, Produce, as much as we can for our own Supply. The great Wisdom of our <HI>British Nation</HI> appears in incou∣raging their own <HI>Produce,</HI> their own <HI>Manufacture;</HI> in incouraging <HI>Labour, Industry, Diligence,</HI> Useful <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Trades</HI> among themselves, that so their <HI>own People</HI> may live by their <HI>own Labour.</HI> And should not we who proceed from them imitate this their laudible <HI>Wis∣dom and Industry?</HI> Methinks the more we do so, the more we deserve their Praise and Commendation. If it is Wise and advantageous in them to do thus, must they not commend it as Wise and Advantageous in us, to imitate them herein?</P>
<P>The Preamble of our <HI>Act,</HI> 1716. for Emitting on <HI>Loan an Hundred Thousand Pound Bills of Credit,</HI> says, <Q>All the Silver Money which formerly made Pay∣ments in Trade to be easy, is now sent into Great Britain to make Returns for part of what is owing there.</Q> Since they have all our <HI>Money</HI> already, they must needs rejoyce to see us more Industrious and Frugal to main∣tain our selves, that we mayn't run farther into their
<PB N="12" REF="002010_0012_0FBA7D0199064000"/>
Debt, and have nothing to pay them. <HI>Parents</HI> are pleased to see their <HI>Children</HI> Thrive by their Business; and must it not be pleasing to our <HI>Nation,</HI> to see us to imitate the Wise, Industrious Example they set us, as to Thrive and Prosper also, at least to Support our selves? Would it not grieve them to see us Proud, Lazy, Extra∣vagant, Spendthrifts, bringing our selves (for want of Wise Industrious Methods) into perplexing Difficulties? Yet how faulty are we herein? We have been so defi∣cient in <HI>Farming,</HI> and managing our own <HI>Manufacture,</HI> lived so much above our <HI>Abilities,</HI> spent so much of <HI>Imported</HI> Commodities; that our <HI>Money's</HI> gone, there's scarce a Penny of it passing for a Twelvemonth. We <HI>need pity,</HI> and <HI>deserve shame,</HI> for these our Mismanagements; let us be Wise and do better.</P>
<P>Now Consider, NOTES OR BILLS OF CREDIT. Indeed I have not so great a clearness in my own mind about these things, as possibly some others have: Yet I'll humbly offer, that I take the Nature of such <HI>Bills</HI> to be to help our <HI>Memories,</HI> shewing how much is Due to us; and the securing our Interest, by Intitling us to so much as the Bill specifies, from those obliged by it to pay us. A <HI>Note</HI> or <HI>Bill of Credit</HI> is not <HI>Money,</HI> nor supposed (in it self considered) to be <HI>Payment,</HI> but rather a Security that Payment shall be made in such a time. A. obliges himself by a Note under his Hand, to pay <HI>Five Pounds</HI> to B. in Two Months time; this Note is neither Money nor Payment, but carries the Nature of a Bond or Obli∣gation, to make Payment at the Time mentioned. The present want of <HI>Money,</HI> seems to be the very reason &amp; Foundation of this Note; for if he who Binds himself by it, had <HI>Five Pounds Money</HI> to lay down, what need he Bind himself to pay it Two Months hence? Every one had rather have present pay, than be assured by a Note he shall be paid hereafter. If every one could make present Pay, for Work done or Goods Bought; he would have no occasion to desire <HI>Creditor's</HI> Patience, or
<PB N="13" REF="002010_0013_0FBA7D02F98F32F0"/>
to give a Note to Pay him after such a Time. So that generally speaking, <HI>Present want of Money,</HI> is the Reason or Foundation of Notes or Bills of Credit.</P>
<P>Of such Bills, some are of a more Private, some of a more Publick nature. I conceive their private ones con∣cern (ordinarily) only those particular Persons whose names are mentioned therein. If <HI>A.</HI> obliges himself by a Note to pay Five pounds to <HI>B.</HI> in three months from the Date thereof; this Note is of no benefit but to <HI>B.</HI> nor can it effect any good for him, till the three months are ended. If a Note mentions the term of time, when payment is to be made; at the Expiration of that term, the Obligation should be fulfilled, and payment be defer∣red no longer. If no particular term be mentioned, but <HI>A,</HI> is obliged to pay Five Pounds to <HI>B.</HI> upon Demand, it's then supposed, that very quickly, or whenever <HI>B,</HI> pleases, he may demand and receive his Five Pounds.</P>
<P>Some such thing as this must necessarily be understood, where there's no particular term set for payment; else the Note would only be a Declaration, that <HI>A.</HI> would always owe for Five Pounds to <HI>B.</HI> and a thousand of such Notes or Declarations are not worth a <HI>Straw:</HI> I would thank no man for his <HI>Note</HI> or <HI>Bond,</HI> obliging himself always to owe me a Thousand Pounds, for if he always owes it, he never pays it, and so I shall never be the better for it.</P>
<P>This may shew too, how weak and groundless a fancy 'tis, that <HI>Paper Money</HI> (as it's called) or <HI>Province Bills,</HI> or <HI>Bank Bills,</HI> if such there were, might be confirmed and establish'd so, as to be of perpetual cur∣rency and use like <HI>Silver Money.</HI> Those who entertain this Notion, may for all me, please themselves with <HI>Notes</HI> and <HI>Bonds,</HI> whereby Persons ingage always to owe (consequentially never to pay) them so much—A∣gain, <HI>A.</HI> may give a <HI>Note</HI> to <HI>B.</HI> to receive Five Pounds of <HI>C.</HI> or in other words, may draw a Note upon <HI>C.</HI> to pay unto <HI>B.</HI> Five Pounds upon sight of said Note, or
<PB N="14" REF="002010_0014_0FBA7D06D1E56BC0"/>
in so many Days after. If C. doth protest or refuse this Note, then 'tis of no present immediate use to any one. If C. accepts the Note, he's then oblig'd to act as that directs. In this case the Note is of no immediate use or benefit to any but to B. again.</P>
<P>If A. gives a <HI>Note</HI> in General terms to this purpose, <Q><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> I acknowledge my self Debtor Five Pounds to the Possessor of the Note, and oblige my self to pay said Sum at the end of Three Months, from the Date here∣of. Dated this &amp;c.—A.—</Q></P>
<P>Such a <HI>Note,</HI> persons may receive or refuse at pleasure, none can be obliged to accept it, but the more the Abili∣ty and Honesty of A. (who Subscribes the Note) is known, so much the more likely 'tis, that the Note will pass with some persons, if they're satisfied 'tis not Counterfeit.</P>
<P>These <HI>Bills</HI> or <HI>Notes</HI> already mentioned, are of a private Nature; their whole Credit or Value depends on the Ability, and Obligation of some particular person considered as in a private capacity.</P>
<P>But then other <HI>Notes</HI> or <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> are of a Pub∣lick Nature; there is, the Anthority or Government in a Kingdom or Country, ingages to make them good, to Pay or Discount them. I take our <HI>Province</HI> Bills (and those of Neighbouring Governments, <HI>New-Hamp∣shire, Connecticut,</HI> &amp;c. to be of this Nature. And tho' these Bills are in common Discourse called <HI>Paper Mo∣ney,</HI> yet the Law does not look on them as <HI>Money,</HI> but calls them <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Publick Credit.</HI> He therefore that receives one of these Bills, doth not receive Money, nor pay properly so called. He that pays down what he ows, hath not occasion to be credited or trusted; but inasmuch as the <HI>Province</HI> had not ready Money to serve the Publick occasions, therefore they emitted these Notes or Bills of Credit, as Security to the Possessor of the Bill for the Sum specified in it. For Instance, the Twenty Shillings Bill. <Q>This Indented Bill of Twenty
<PB N="15" REF="002010_0015_0FBA7D08F8ACE940"/>
Shillings due from the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay in <HI>New-England,</HI> to the possessor thereof, shall be in value equal to Money; and shall be accordingly ac∣cepted by the Treasurer, and Receivers subordinate to him in all Publick payments, and for any Stock at any time in the Treasury &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>He that possesseth the Bill, do's not possess <HI>Twenty Shillings,</HI> for that Sum is due (therefore not paid) to him; nor do's he possess Money, for the Bill is to be in value equal to Money, therefore the Bill is nothing but a Note or Instrument whereby the Province is obliged to Pay or Discount Twenty Shillings to the Possessor. I use the word pay or discount, because tho' the Bill says, Twenty Shillings are due, from the <HI>Province</HI> to the <HI>Possessor,</HI> yet it do's not directly say, that the Province shall pay Twenty Shillings to the Possessor; but only that this Bill shall be accepted as equal to Money by the Treasurer, &amp;c. or if there be any Stock in the Treasury the Possessor may bring his Bill, and have Twenty Shill∣ings worth (as I take the meaning to be) of said Stock.</P>
<P>But I don't see it likely, that there should be any Stock in the Treasury besides Bills; while the Bills are to be received there at <HI>five per Cent advance;</HI> for while so, who would pay his <HI>Tax</HI> in any thing besides Bills? The Province owes the Possessor Twenty Shillings, when the Possessor is taxed one and Twenty Shillings to the Province, and brings this Bill, the Treasurer receives it, and so the Twenty Shillings due to the Possessor is dis∣counted, yea, his Twenty Shillings pass for Twenty one Shillings, by the five per Cent. advance. So that I hum∣bly conceive, the principal way of Sinking the Bills, will be by calling them in, and discounting with (rather than paying) the Possessor.</P>
<P>The Fund or Security for Province Bills, is the Duties of Impost and Excise, and also the Tax to be levied on Polls, and Estates both Real and Personal; as appears by the Acts for emitting Bills. <HI>Anno. Dom.</HI> 1702. &amp; 1703.
<PB N="16" REF="002010_0016_0FBA7D10F65F3468"/>
Therefore the more of these Bills are received into the Treasury, by <HI>Impost, Excise,</HI> and <HI>Rates,</HI> so much the less the Province is in Debt; for this drawing Bills, dis∣counts with the Possessors of them.</P>
<P>And the shorter the time is for drawing in of Bills the greater will be their value and esteem in the minds of Persons. Every one desires present pay; if this can't be had, yet the sooner the Debt is paid or discounted, so much the better to the Creditor. Any one had rather have a Note from his Debtor; to pay him in Three Months, than in three Years. Therefore to defer the paying or discounting a Bill of Credit is a certain and ef∣fectual way to depreciate or lessen the value of it. In Private Dealings, if a Person finds that he whom he Trades with, doth not keep his word, nor pay at the time he oblig'd himself by his Note; he'll be the more backward to deal with or trust him for the future: This is too true and plain to need proof. The nature of the thing is the same, as to Publick Bills. It's the promise or ingagement of the Government, that gives the whole value and currency to the Bill, and makes so much due from the Province to the Possessor of it. If therefore the Ingagement be not complied with at the time set, but payment (or calling in or discounting the Bill) be postponed; does not this lessen the value of the Bill? and some wise and good Persons even doubt about the fair∣ness of this postponing, however it seems plain, that it do's not commend Publick Ingagements, to the belief or trust of Persons.</P>
<P>Do's it not give them an handle to argue; that if the fulfilling of one Publick promise be postponed, so it may be with another, and what will publick Faith (or ingage∣ment) signifie after this rate? Whereas it is the Wis∣dom, Honour and Safety of any Government to have their Credit strengthen'd, and all their Ingagements readily relied on.</P>
<P>If some will say this <HI>Postponing</HI> is no hurt, for the
<PB N="17" REF="002010_0017_0FBA7D13A83409B8"/>
promise is made to ourselves, and we may defer the ac∣complishment at pleasure. Reply. But is not the matter otherwise? The Ingagement in the Bill is made by the Province or Government, not to it, but to the Possessor of the Bill. And generally speaking, none but he to whom the Promise is made; can fairly <HI>release</HI> or <HI>defer</HI> the Accomplishment of it. If a Person engageth to pay me 20 <HI>s.</HI> at Two Months end, when that term is Expir∣ed, he can't fairly <HI>defer</HI> Payment, without my leave or Allowance.</P>
<P>However, if <HI>Postponing the drawing in of Bills,</HI> does sink the Credit or Esteem of them, and so raise the Price of Commodities Imported and Produced here; this hurts many. The <HI>Merchant</HI> and <HI>Husbandman</HI> seems least hurt, because they can raise on the Commodities they Sell to each other, and so keep a sort of Ballance. But those suffer greatly, who live on <HI>Salaries</HI> and on the <HI>Interest</HI> or Incomes of their Estates; and so do <HI>Tradesmen</HI> and <HI>Day-Labourers.</HI> If I'm a <HI>Labourer</HI> and can have <HI>Four Shillings</HI> for a Days Work, and a few Years ago I could buy <HI>Wheat</HI> for <HI>Five Shillings</HI> a Bushel, but now must give <HI>Ten;</HI> this shows, that the Produce of my Labour is not above half the Benefit to me that it was. This is a very great pressure and burden on poor Labourers, and I can't but think it's much owing, to the mean opinion Per∣sons have of <HI>Bills of Credit.</HI></P>
<P>I think I have heard, as tho' in <HI>South-Carolina, Silver Money</HI> has been at above 30 <HI>s.</HI> an Ounce, and that a <HI>pair of Shoes</HI> have cost above <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> there in Bills, when possibly 8 or 9 Shillings in <HI>Silver</HI> would have pur∣chased them. We should take heed in this <HI>Province,</HI> that we don't stear the same Course with them. Therefore it seems much for the advantage of this People (in my appre∣hension) to have the <HI>Bills of Publick Credit</HI> called into the Treasury, as soon as the Establishment they are on will admit of. To increase such Bills, or continue them out longer than the foot they're on requires, appears to me to be a me∣thod
<PB N="18" REF="002010_0018_0FBA7D151FB2F998"/>
for continuing and increasing our misery. To desire the Emitting more Bills, or Postponing the Collecting of outstanding ones, is plainly desiring to be in Debt, when as every wise and honest Man should desire to be out of Debt, <HI>&amp; to owe no Man any thing but love. Parents should lay up for their Children,</HI> but if the present Gene∣ration do not draw in the Publick Bills as soon as fairly may be, they may Intail Debts on their Posterity; who must (Buy as it were, &amp;) Pay for the <HI>Inheritances</HI> their Fathers left them, if they would be the full and proper Owners of them. And is it not unkind in <HI>Parents,</HI> thus to antecipate, and while Living to spend on that which after they are Dead, their Children must Labour and Pay for?</P>
<P>But here's a Difficulty to be considered, <HI>Paper Money</HI> (as 'tis called) is so scarce already, that it's something troublesome to deal between Man and Man for want of more; and the more is called in, the greater will the Difficulty be.</P>
<P>Reply. Tho' its difficult now and probably will be more so for a while, yet it may be considered, that the pressing Difficulty should make us do all we can to get rid of it; which (I suppose) can't be done, till the <HI>Bills</HI> are called in and Burnt. This can't be done at once but gradually. And the lessening their Quantity will certain∣ly increase their Value, so that gradually they'l be esteem∣ed as good as <HI>Silver Money,</HI> tho' now there's a vast Difference. And I think the Price of Commodities Im∣ported and Produced here, must necessarily <HI>fall,</HI> as the Value and Esteem of <HI>Bills</HI> do <HI>rise.</HI> This seems a likely way too, to make <HI>Money</HI> gradually pass again among us; For if the Value of <HI>Bills</HI> does rise to be Equal with <HI>Money</HI> in Private Commerce, and Five Shillings in <HI>Mo∣ney</HI> will Buy no more than a Five Shilling <HI>Bill,</HI> then the <HI>Possessor</HI> will almost as readily part with one as t'other. But now, tho' Quantities of <HI>Silver</HI> (as I've heard) are Yearly brought into the Country, yet the difference between
<PB N="19" REF="002010_0019_0FBA7D169AB97610"/>
that and Bills being so great as 'tis, the <HI>Silver</HI> does not pass between Man and Man in common dealing, but is bought up by the <HI>Merchants</HI> to make Returns to Great Britain.</P>
<P>If you ask, Whether An Act to cause <HI>Impost</HI> &amp; <HI>Excise</HI> to be paid in <HI>Silver,</HI> would not oblige Merchants to bring it into the Country, and so gradually make it pass among us?</P>
<P>I'll modestly reply, it belongs not to me to decide this Case; yet Two Difficulties seem to attend it.</P>
<P>First, Would not this lesson the Value of <HI>Bills,</HI> if the <HI>Publick</HI> should prefer <HI>Silver</HI> to them in such a way?</P>
<P>Secondly, Is not this directly contrary to the Tenor of the <HI>Bills</HI> themselves? That says, the <HI>Bill shall be in Value equal to Money, and shall be accordingly accepted by the Treasurer, &amp;c. and in all Publick Payments.</HI> If to give Currency to the Bill, the Government have made it Equal to <HI>Money</HI> in all <HI>Publick Payments;</HI> nay 5 per Cent. better in such Payments; then how can it be re∣fused in <HI>any</HI> Publick Payment, and <HI>Silver</HI> be preferred to it, without directly contradicting the Publick Engage∣ments, which alone has given it all the Value it has? If therefore we would make no <HI>infraction</HI> on the <HI>Bills,</HI> or the <HI>Establishment</HI> they are on; I see no way to <HI>raise</HI> their Value and Esteem among People, but by lessening their Quantity and calling them in as soon as fairly may be. And tho' the doing this may increase our Difficulties in some regards, yet it may decrease them in others. I think our over Trading, Living above our Abilities, needlesly spending <HI>Imported</HI> Commodities, and doing too little to supply our selves, have evidently, tho' gradually brought these Difficulties, we should therefore be patient (not fretful and quarrelsome) under them, and be thankful to Divine Providence, if we may gradually (tho' with many an hard rub) get rid of them, and not Intail them as a mischief and misery on Posterity.</P>
<P>I suppose <HI>Money</HI> is now as <HI>Plenty</HI> as ever in the World
<PB N="20" REF="002010_0020_0FBA7D18EA190DC8"/>
in General, and daily increases rather than decrea∣ses; its now as much esteemed as ever, as a Medium of Trade. And if we were Prudent and Industrious and Frugal, I don't see but that we might have our share in it (in an ordinary course of Pro∣vidence) as well as formerly, and as well as other Coun∣tries who have no <HI>Mines</HI> but receive it only by Com∣merce. Possibly the Ingenious may have many <HI>Schemes</HI> and <HI>Projections,</HI> to bring and keep <HI>Money</HI> in the Coun∣try, but I can think of none so honest and likely, as to make our <HI>Export</HI> exceed our <HI>Import,</HI> which by Industry and Frugality (with an ordinary blessing) we might easily do. We can't be so <HI>Sanguine</HI> as to think, that other Countries will give us <HI>Money</HI> for nothing; if we have it of them, it must be by way of Exchange for some Produce of our Country, or the Fruit of our Labour. It therefore we make our <HI>Export</HI> exceed our <HI>Import,</HI> it must needs bring and keep <HI>Money</HI> here, and I'm humbly of Opinion, that no other method will be effectual to do it. If a Private <HI>Family,</HI> besides what they spend of their own <HI>Produce</HI> raise <HI>Twenty Pounds</HI> worth for a <HI>Market</HI> Year∣ly, and Yearly Buy <HI>Thirty Pounds,</HI> then they're <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> in Debt and behind hand. But if of the <HI>Twenty</HI> they <HI>Sell,</HI> they lay out but half, then they're <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> before hand, they have it ready to serve their occasions. And if the Province in general would do thus with refe∣rence to other Countries, would it not bring <HI>Money</HI> here. I think all the Province in their various Capaci∣ties should endeavour this; and none more (with Sub∣mission) than you in <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly conceive, your case as loudly calls for pity and some speedy methods of redress, as the Case of any Town in the Province, if not more. Your thriving (hu∣manely speaking) depends on the numerousness of your People; and their being suitably imployed. But don't your numbers of late decrease? has not the low esteem of Bills so raised the price of necessaries, That <HI>Trades∣men</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="002010_0021_0FBA7D1A682CED68"/>
and <HI>Labourers</HI> can scarce subsist. Is not their being put off with half <HI>Money,</HI> and half <HI>Goods,</HI> a great damage to them? Besides this, if they're Diligent and receive great wages (as the hirer thinks) yet that wages suffi∣ceth not to payment; <HI>Rates,</HI> to buy <HI>Wood, Food, Cloath∣ing,</HI> &amp;c. Have not these difficulties caused many of your Laborious People to move out of your Town? and if these difficulties continue and grow, wont they drive a∣way more? And do's not this thining of your <HI>Laborious Inhabitants,</HI> tend to hurt and weaken you? If your Members continue to decrease, some of your wealthy Men may rather be called owners of Houses and Shops, than Land-Lords, for they'l scarce have Tenants to hire them, or if they have, the continued high price for ne∣cessaries, will render them unable to pay rent, and possi∣bly make them a Charge to the <HI>Town</HI> too. If this be not the present Aspect of the present Posture of Affairs, then I'm mistaken in my guess.</P>
<P>Therefore I think Wisdom and Interest should move you, to endeavour in your Station as far as fairly may be, to diminish the quantity and thereby raise the value, of Bills of Credit, that so a reducing the price of necessa∣ries may incourage your industrious Inhabitants to abide with you, and draw others such unto you. And for you to pitch on some proper methods, to promote <HI>In∣dustry,</HI> &amp; <HI>Manufacture</HI> among you, that so your People (by Gods blessing) may live by the fruit of their La∣bours, to me seems necessary to prevent your farther <HI>Diminution,</HI> and to prevent your Poor being so <HI>numerous,</HI> that their Neighbours will scarce be able to Support them, but rather be obliged to Sink with them; I've heard that you in <HI>Boston</HI> are very charitable, ready to give Alms, and I believe it; Possibly some think, if good Part of what's thus bestowed, were put into a <HI>Stock</HI> to imploy the Poor, it might be better for your Town. You lay up <HI>Grain</HI> in Store to supply your Inhabitants, I suppose it prudent to do so, But if your Inhabitants
<PB N="22" REF="002010_0022_0FBA7D1E3667BFE8"/>
by the produce of their Labour, can't pay for it, it's but a sorrowful Case still.</P>
<P>You may think on two things. Would not the settling of a <HI>Market</HI> help you? are there not many needless <HI>Re∣tailers,</HI> who buy up <HI>Provisions</HI> and Sell them with ad∣vance to their poorer Neighbours? Do not the Poor oppress the Poor in this? Is there no remedy for this? Would not a well regulated <HI>Market</HI> help you greatly? The Scripture frequently speaks of <HI>Markets</HI> as usual in former times; And I suppose the Ancient and Populous Cities who now use them, would by no means be without them.</P>
<P>If the Licences to Sell Drink among you, were great∣ly diminished, would not this help you? If I'm not greatly mis-inform'd abundance of Cost and Time is need∣lesly spent among you in Drink, and even by the <HI>Poor</HI> that can't subsist without Alms.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>Retailing Drink promote, Trade.</HI> Ans. It's the <HI>Re∣dundance</HI> and <HI>Excess</HI> of it that I'm against. In this the Seller spends his time, without raising one farthings worth produce for Publick Good, and the buyer spends Time and Cost for what he had better be without. This is double damage to the Publick.</P>
<P>If you should now ask, whether a Law to make Bills equal to <HI>Money</HI> between Man and Man, and to make them answer Specialties that is Bonds for <HI>Silver</HI> &amp;c. would not ease our Difficulties and bring in <HI>Silver</HI> a∣mong us.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I own my self unable to see thro' the Proprie∣ty of such a Law. For I conceive it not easie if possible for humane Laws to change Mens minds about things?</P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Law</HI> allows <HI>five per Cent. advance</HI> to Bills in Publick payments; and made the tender of them for payment (<HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1712) sufficient to stop Executi∣on, I say, notwithstanding these Acts in favour of the Bills, yet Men don't esteem them as Money, but will give (as I am told, Twelve Shillings in Bills for an Ounce
<PB N="23" REF="002010_0023_0FBA7D21076AF0E8"/>
of Silver, which Ounce by our Law is but a small matter above Seven Shillings; A Law indeed might lay re∣straints and threaten Penalties, but it can't change Men's minds, to make them think a piece of Paper is a piece of Money, They'll not readily believe such a Transubstanti∣ation, if Men really think that Silver is more for their profit than Bills, I don't see how a Law to make them equal in Trade, can universally govern their Practice in buying and selling which are voluntary actions; For if the Law should threaten a Fine to him, that would ask Twenty Five Shillings in Bills for Twenty Shillings in Silver, yet if a man ask me whether I'll sell such a Com∣modity I have; I may surely ask him how much he'll give and in what. And if he offers me Twenty Five Shil∣ings in Bills, I may refuse it if I please, who can oblige me to Sell? When yet if he offered Twenty Shillings in Sil∣ver, possibly I might gladly receive it.</P>
<P>I readily grant, that a Law to make Bills and Money equal in Trade, might probably make some alteration in practice; but as to the Expedience of such a Law, I hesitate, and submit it to wiser Judgments.</P>
<P>As to the other part. <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> To make Bills to answer Specialties, I'm at present not able to see thro' the fair∣ness and honesty of it.</P>
<P>English Men are justly Fond of Property as well as Li∣berty. If I have Land or Goods to sell, I may ask a price I think proper; If none will gave it, I keep what's my own. If any offer to buy, I may ask how much they'll give and in what? if they offer to pay me in Gold, I may refuse it, if I chuse Silver rather, and if we make a plain honest Bargain, the buyer is obliged to pay me so much Silver in such a time; surely I may justly claim it, when the Time's expired, if he neglects to pay and I thereupon sue him, would not any honest <HI>Jurors</HI> and <HI>Judges</HI> find and declare for the Plantiff? In matters of <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> as they're called, I think the common rules of Justice and Equity would say; that
<PB N="24" REF="002010_0024_0FBA7D22812D0A68"/>
none but he to whom the Obligation is made, can fairly release or lessen that Obligation; If I Sold Land a Year ago, and the Buyer was obliged to pay me so much Silver for it, at the Term of Two Years; and a Law comes between and says, I shall take <HI>Bills</HI> instead of <HI>Silver,</HI> am not I a sufferer? I think Laws are commonly supposed to look forward, and not backward. The Law in <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1712. which made the offer of Bills for payment sufficient to stop Execution for Debts, contracted since <HI>Octob.</HI> 30. 1705. yet did it on this foot, as appears from the <HI>Preamble,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That such Debts were generally un∣derstood to be contracted for Bills. And so that Law, justly made an exception for <HI>Specialties,</HI> and express Contracts in Writing. If you say, But to make Bills answer <HI>Specialties,</HI> would be an ease to many poor Debtors. <HI>Reply.</HI> But if it's unjust and inju∣rious to Creditors (whether poor or rich) who dare plead for it? God himself has said, <HI>he shall do no un∣righteousness in judgment, thou shalt not respect the person of the Poor; nor honour the person of the migh∣ty. Neither shalt thou Countenance a poor man in his cause. Justice</HI> and <HI>Equity</HI> should be preserved between Debtor and Creditor; whether they're rich or poor.</P>
<P>If you say, What then shall those do who are obliged by their own voluntary Bonds to pay Silver, now there's no Silver passing? <HI>Reply,</HI> I would advice such Debtors to beg forbearance in their Creditors, and say to them, (submitting to Providence,) Have patience with me and I'll pay thee all; and let them honestly and industriously indeavour to do so. And I would advise Creditors to a∣void extremities, vigour, not needlesly take their Brother by the Throat; nor gladly catch at an advantage, to squeeze from a Debtor, twice so much in value, merely because he can't get Money. Whatever advantage we may happen to have by any humane Laws, yet considered as <HI>Christians</HI> we can't be exempted from that rule, <HI>As ye would that Men should do unto you, do ye also to</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="002010_0025_0FBA7D28E6B28A38"/>
<HI>them likewise;</HI> we should rather suffer some damage ourselves, than bring a very great one on our Neigh∣bours. I presume that as Bills decrease in quantity they'll increase in value, and gradually before they are all in, be as good as <HI>Money.</HI> Therefore <HI>Industry, Honesty, Frugality</HI> in him that's under Bonds, and Patience and Forbearance in him that hath the <HI>Obligation</HI> (so far as he well can) seems the best way to prevent very great wrong, either to <HI>Debtor</HI> or <HI>Creditor.</HI> This advice re∣fers especially to Honest Industrious Debtors, for if a person is in my Debt, and yet lives idly, extravagantly, is in no likely way to pay what he owes, but rather to spend and waste the Substance of <HI>Creditors,</HI> then what reason is there I should forbear him? Why should I suffer my Substance (gotten by honest In∣dustry) to be wasted in gratifying his <HI>Pride, Idle∣ness or Extravagance,</HI> If thro' his Extravagance he's not able to pay <HI>Fifty per Cent.</HI> why should I suffer him to go on till he can't pay <HI>Twenty Five?</HI> I pre∣sume many are now convinced, that the giving too much and too long Credit has been hurtful both to the Persons trusting and trusted, and 'twill be well if there don't speedily appear many more proofs of this.</P>
<P>As I would not advise any <HI>Creditor</HI> rigorously to take the advantage of his <HI>Debtor,</HI> so neither would I advise any Friend of mine, if he were <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>able,</HI> to hoard up <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> meerly to make his Neighbours buy them with Silver at legal weight, to pay their <HI>Taxes</HI> with. I say I would not advise any Friend of mine to <HI>hoard up Bills</HI> for this pur∣pose, lest he should get that Displeasure from Hea∣ven which will be more bitter to him than all his <HI>gain</HI> by it, on Earth, would be sweet.</P>

Since we should <HI>love our Neighbour as our selves,</HI> how can we receive <HI>Bills</HI> of them at the low Value they're now of; and yet lay them by on purpose to make them Pay us near twice as much for them in a little time? I desire no such Gain. And if any should hoard up <HI>Bills,</HI> thinking in a few Years to be paid for them out of the Treasury in <HI>Silver,</HI> at Legal Weight, they may possibly find themselves mistaken. For they are to be received for <HI>any Stock</HI> in the Treasury, and if the <HI>Government</HI> should see meet as <HI>Bills</HI> grow few and scarce, to take something else <HI>besides Silver</HI> for <HI>Rates,</HI> whether <HI>Grain, Flax, Hemp,</HI> &amp;c. possibly when Persons come to have their <HI>Bills</HI> paid for, they may be obliged to take <HI>such things</HI> as shall <HI>then</HI> be in the Treasury. I humbly con∣ceive therefore, it's most fair, honest and neighbourly to keep the <HI>Bills passing in Commerce,</HI> till they're gradu∣ally called in and burnt, and not to hoard them up from any <HI>Private veiws</HI> or thirst after <HI>Self-Interest.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Sir, out of true Love to my Country, whose Welfare I heartily wish and aim at, and without being asked by any one, or designing to flatter or disgust any Person or Persons whatsoever, I have once more open'd my Thoughts to you; I don't offer them with an imposing air, but modestly submit them to Censure. If upon Scaning what's offered, you see rea∣son to fault any Sentiments therein, please to Ascribe it to the want of <HI>more Skill,</HI> and not want of <HI>Good-Will,</HI> to promote the Publick Welfare. If you and I differ in <HI>Schemes</HI> and <HI>Projections,</HI> yet let us be one in <HI>Love and Friendship;</HI> let us by no means <HI>raise</HI> or <HI>cherish Parties or Divisions</HI> (which directly tend to weaken and ruin a People) but bearing with different Apprehensions in each other; let us be Friendly, Neigh∣bourly, Peaceable, Honest, Frugal, Industrious, every

one minding Our <HI>own Business,</HI> and indeavouring the <HI>Welfare of the whole,</HI> this will be most advantagious to the <HI>Whole</HI> and to all the Parts of it.</P>
<P>From your Friend among the <HI>Oakes</HI> and <HI>Pines,</HI> April 14. 1719.</P>
