<BIBL>JEREMIAH, viii. 22.</BIBL>
<Q>IS there no Balm in Gilead? is there no Physi∣cian there? Why then is not the Health of the Daughter of my People recovered.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS is a Day of the Gladness of our Heart, on Account of that great and comprehensive Blessing of FREEDOM, which <HI>now,</HI> in a peculiar manner, ex∣ect itself, animating all the Members of Society and smiling in every Countenance, While LIBERTY stretches forth her Hand, without Controul, to give her Suffiages for Men <HI>to rule us in the Fear of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>WE also Sing of Mercy, in the gracious smiles of Providence upon the important undertakings of our Hands. Our Work and our Warfare are crowned with remarkable Success. <HI>The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</HI></P>
<P>AND under all these temporal Advantages, we are <HI>bless'd with</HI> numberless <HI>spiritual Blessings,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="008598_0005_102F94855DDB43C8"/>
<HI>in heavenly Places in CHRIST.</HI> Our Eyes be∣hold our Teachers, and <HI>our Ears hear the joyful Sound.</HI> All which are Arguments of Praise; and hopeful Symptoms of a healthy State.</P>
<P>IT may therefore seem a little grating, at such a Time, to hear of <HI>Physicians</HI> and <HI>Medicines,</HI> implying <HI>Diseases, Wounds</HI> and <HI>Bruises,</HI> that in∣danger the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e. Surely, <HI>the whole need not the Physician.</HI> And are we not in perfect Health? What Tokens of Sickness or Danger does the Preacher discover, in the Daughter of Zion, whose Countenance looks so fair and flou∣rishing?</P>
<P>THE Answer is obvious: they appear in our ungrateful Returns to the Father of Mercy's for all his Benefits unto us. We are highly exalted, on account of Privileges:—flush'd with Succes∣ses past, and confident of more to come; whilst <HI>we are laden with Iniquity</HI> and wrapped up in Security.</P>
<P>OUR Case too nearly resembles <HI>that</HI> of the Jews, in the Days of our Prophet. They were GOD's peculiar People: and he had long in∣dulged them as Children: <HI>fed them to the full,</HI> with every Kind of Blessing. But, in return, they filled Jerusalem, the holy City, with their Abominations: such as Adultery, Uncleanness, Idolatry, Oppression, Murder and Blood: all which cry'd for Vengeance.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Josiah</HI> did every thing, that became a pious Prince to reform them. <HI>He turned to</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="008598_0006_102F9486E85B2D40"/>
<HI>God himself with all his Heart and Soul.</HI> And, in his Zeal for God, exerted his Authority and spread his Influence abroad, thro'out his Domi∣nions, obliging his People to keep a Solemn Pas∣sover, to renew their Covenant, and to reform their evil Manners. But the Searcher of Hearts discovered their Hypocrisy, and complained of it,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. 3. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole Heart, but seignedly, saith the Lord.</HI> Therefore God determined to remove her out of his sight.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 23. 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>UPON <HI>Josiah's</HI> Death, they bid Defiance to Heaven, and returned to their former Wicked∣ness, <HI>like the Dog to his Vomit.</HI> Jeremiah repro∣ved them, and solemnly warned them of their Danger.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 4. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Destruction upon Destruction is cried, for the whole Land is spoiled:</HI> Assuring them of Protection, upon their Amendment.</P>
<P>BUT they regarded not his Threatnings not hearkned to his Intreaties: but flatter'd them∣selves, that neither Famine nor Sword should reach them.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. 5. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>MOV'D with Pity at the Sight of his guilty People, insensible of their Danger, on the Bor∣ders of Destruction, the holy Prophet lamented over them, and gave his Sorrows vent in these pathetick Strains.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Cont. ver. 18,—21.</NOTE> <HI>When I would comfort my self against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. Be∣hold the voice of the cry of the Daughter of my People. The harvest is past, the summer is ended</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="008598_0007_102F948A67596128"/>
<HI>and we are not saved. For the hurt of the daugh∣ter of my People am I hurt.</HI> It is for my Coun∣try, and especially for the Church of God, that I am thus deeply affected. Thus the Prophet bewail'd the dying state of Jerusalem, <HI>which he preferred above his chief Joy.</HI> And now, as the symptoms of Death increase, the Man of God, like a tender Father, distressed for his first Born, and unwilling to give up all his hope, looks round upon his Friends, with all the marks of Agony in his Countenance; or directs his Eyes to Heaven, and powers out his Soul in the ser∣vent Expressions of my Text, <HI>Is there no Balm in Gilead? is there no Physician there? why then is not the Health of the Daughter of my People recovered?</HI> They seem to be the last efforts of a generous Soul, under the deepest Concern to save a diseased People, insensible of their Dan∣ger, on the Brink of Ruin.</P>
<P>And may import, either</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT there is very little hope of saving them from utter Destruction.</HI> That there is ei∣ther no Remedy for their Disease, or else no skillful Physician to apply it. Or rather,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT their Disease is not in its nature in∣curable, neither is there any want of Means or Physicians.</HI> Mount Gilead is near at hand; and <HI>that'</HI>s a Place abounding with <HI>Balm</HI> or <HI>Rosin,</HI> whose peculiar Property is "to dissolve Hardness and to clear and close up Wounds;" and so is a fit Emblem of the softening Grace of God;

First, <HI>I am to show, what Diseases or evil Habits are imminently dangerous, threatning De∣struction to a People.</HI> They are such as these,</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>A Selfish Spirit, or the prevalence of Self Love.</HI> This pernicious Principle, took place with our original Defection from God. When Man for sook the Lord, he lost sight of the only Ob∣ject of his Happiness, retired into <HI>himself,</HI> and made <HI>himself</HI> the Object of his Love, and the Centre of all his Desires and Actions. And if so, the Principle of Self Love, bears a universal sway, exercising Dominion over all the humane Race, until renewed by the Grace of God, and directed by his holy Spirit. But lest we mistake the Principle, &amp; call Good, Evil; let us attend to our Saviour's Teaching; upon the head of Self Love, Mat. 22. 39. <HI>Thou shall love thy neighbour as thy self.</HI> So then, we may and ought <HI>to love ourselves.</HI> Our Lord allows of it, or takes it for granted. This is a Prin∣ciple founded in humane Nature: not to be rooted out, but refined▪ by the Grace of God. And so is not, simply considered, any Fault or Disease. But then; remember thou hast a Neighbour, that thou art related to Society; the Bond of which is Love. And therefore, thou shall love thy <HI>Neighbour,</HI> as well as <HI>thy self.</HI> Which seems plainly to intimate, that our Lord does not here speak of loving <HI>our selves</HI> merely as <HI>individual,</HI> made to dwell alone; but as we stand connected with our fellow-men, as Mem∣bers
<PB N="11" REF="008598_0010_102F949C06319628"/>
of a public Body, or Community, whose Happiness he would have us promote, with the warmest Intention. And as Love is productive of every kind Office, therefore consider, how thou lovest <HI>thy self.</HI> Sincerely,—fervently,—in∣variably,—and then go and do likewise to thy Neighbour: not only to <HI>One</HI> but <HI>All.</HI> Love all the Members of that Body, of which thou also art a Member. This is due to the Public. And here is the Rule or Measure, by which thou art to render to thy Neighbour his Due. <HI>Love him as thy self.</HI> So that <HI>Love</HI> is a social Grace, planted in the humane Soul, not merely for our <HI>own</HI> Happiness, but for the good of <HI>others</HI> also. But when a Man views himself, as an Individual Only, and not as a Member of Society; and thereupon consults nothing but his Own perso∣nal Interest, not regarding the Interest of the Body: or if he lends his Assistance to his Neigh∣bour, it is with this ultimate View, that <HI>himself</HI> alone may finally reap the Advantage. Such a Man is guilty of that criminal <HI>selfishness</HI> which I here speak of. And this is a most dangerous Disease, threatning Destruction to the People where it reigns. The Apostle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> speaks of it, as such 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2. In the last days <HI>peri∣lous Times</HI> shall come; for Men shall <HI>be Lovers of their Own selves.</HI> These are perilous Times indeed, when the generality of Men living up∣on Earth, shall be left to the Power of <HI>self love;</HI> forgetting their Relation to the Body, shall every
<PB N="12" REF="008598_0011_102F949D9F95BD38"/>
one seek his own private Interest and not ano∣thers: When, through Covetousness, Malice and Envy, they shall never rest, 'till they have murdered the public Interest and buried <HI>that</HI> out of sight, which should have been the great Object of their Attention and the Height of their Ambition to Secure. A moments Attention to the actings of this narrow, fordid Principle▪ will discover the Danger of it. For they that are actuated by such a Spirit, have this only Ob∣ject in View, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>their own personal Interest;</HI> not as it is included in the public, or common good, but as seperate from it. And according∣ly the Schemes they Project and the Measures they Pursue, are from the some Principle, and for the same End, even <HI>self Interest.</HI> Now, let us View all the Members of a Body, or Society, (and why not <HI>One</HI> as well as <HI>another,</HI> and <HI>all</HI> as well as <HI>One,</HI>) influenced by this selfish Prin∣ciple, and see what dreadful work they will make. For their Interest being opposite to each Other, (which must be the Case, on the present Hypothesis,) it follows, that there will be a per∣petual clashing, among Individuals, in their re∣spective Measures and Means, to attain their private Ends, (for the Interest of One is the In∣jury of another, where self reigns,) and then, all their Measures will interfere with the public Interest: for <HI>this</HI> they have all agreed to sacri∣fice to <HI>self.</HI> What then becomes of the Com∣munity? that Body of People which were united
<PB N="13" REF="008598_0012_102F949F2E3FD800"/>
together for social Purposes? why, it is demo∣lished. This Tabernacle i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spoiled, and all its Cords are broken. And what becomes of the <HI>selfish Man</HI> at last? Why, however insensible he may be of the issue, he oversetts the Building, and like Sampson, (in a better Cause,) is cashed himself, by its Fall. For, by promoting him∣self, to the injury of the Public, he sensibly weakens the hands of that Body, yea disarms it or all its Power, (as far as <HI>he</HI> is of any conse∣quence▪) and so deprives himself of that pro∣tection and strength, which the Community, had he not dissolv'd its Bonds, would have exerted to his Defence, in a time of extremity, which <HI>he</HI> as an Individual, can no longer avoid nor endure. Mark the end then, of the selfish Man; to whom the Psalmists words may be apply'd,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psalm 7 15. 16.</NOTE> <HI>He made a Pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made▪ His mischief shall return upon his own Head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own Pate.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>A party spirit is a dangerous Evil.</HI> This originates from self, or is only the same spirit, acting in a different form and carrying a wider breadth. But then, every Sect or Party of Men, professing the same Opinion, ought not to be look'd upon, as <HI>Party spirited,</HI> in any bad sense, <HI>merely</HI> for their uniting in sentiments, that differ from the rest, or other part of the Commu∣nity. For, every Man has a natural, unalienable
<PB N="14" REF="008598_0013_102F94A5F5510470"/>
Right to think and see for himself. And if he is conscientious, he will be at Pains to find out Truth: which having found, to his satisfaction, must be dear to him. He therefore with his Brethren of the same Opinion, ought, as honest Men, to be zealous for those Truths, in propor∣tion to the Importance of them. Sects or Par∣ties, in this Sence, as they are unavoidable, so they may not be hurtful to the Body. They don't threaten the public safety, provided all Parties duely consider themselves as equally re∣lated to the Public; and do tenderly affect one another as Parts and Members of the same Body; holding up the public Health in constant View, as a Matter of the highest Importance, and the End of all their Pursuits. Such a gene∣rous Spirit as this, which is no ways inconsistent with Parties, simply considered, will secure the public good, and, at the same time, the Peace and safety of all Parties and Individuals. But when a Party or Number of Men, unite to carry on a particular Design, either without any Regard to the public Health, or unhappy mistaking <HI>themselves</HI> for the <HI>Public,</HI> and thence concluding that nothing is of general Benefit but what favours <HI>their</HI> party-Interest: In consequence of which their Strength and Zeal is put forth in promo∣ting, not the real good of the Public, but of their own Party, to the crushing of their dissenting Brethren, as if they were not Members in com∣mon of the same Body, This, I apprehend is to
<PB N="15" REF="008598_0014_102F94A9184397F8"/>
be <HI>Party Spirited</HI> in an evil Sense, and is of most pernicious Consequence. This affords continual Matter for the working of Envy, Ma∣lice and Bitterness, the Fruit of which is Dis∣cord, Strife and Divisions which give the most fatal Wounds to the Common Wealth. This is for a House or Kingdom to be divided against itself, which our Lord assures us can∣not stand.</P>
<P>WHEN Parties are actuated by such a narrow, contracted Spirit, each of them pursuing their respective Interests, separate from the public Good, and regardless of its Fate, their Conduct is as unnatural and tends as directly to the De∣struction of a People, as if the Fingers of the Right Hand should militate against those of the Left; and <HI>both Hands,</HI> in their zealous strife, neglect the Defence of the Body, when a drawn Sword is pointed at the Heart.</P>
<P>SHOULD any plead, that the Constitution is weak, the Government bad, and the Rulers ty∣rannical, all this wont legitimate a party Spirit, nor justify its ruling, so long as there is <HI>a pub∣lic, common Good;</HI> upon the securing of which, the <HI>safety</HI> of Individuals, under such a Govern∣ment, may be obtained.</P>
<P>THE holy Religion, that GOD has taught his People, is of such a generous Temper, that it not only forbids their touching the public Peace, but requires them to seek and promote it (even under an <HI>idolatrous and tyrannical Ma∣gistrate.</HI>

Hear the Direction and Charge of the GOD of Israel to that People, in the Babylonish Captivity.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer 29 7.</NOTE> <HI>And seek the Peace of the City whe∣ther I have caused you to be carryed away Cap∣tives and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the Peace thereof shall ye have Peace</HI> All Parties and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, however they may differ in Sentiments, as to other Matters, are hereby taught to be tender of the public Safety of any State, <HI>that gives them Protection.</HI> "Every Passenger is concern'd in the safety of the Ship". How unreasonable then, as well as hurtful, is the In∣dulgence of a party Spirit, in a well founded christian Government?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A murmuring Spirit threatens Destruction to a People.</HI> "To murmur, is to speak against a Person or thing, out of Dislike, Impatience or Discontent." implying an injurious Reflection upon the great Governor of the World. This was one of the crying Sins among the Jews. But not peculiar to <HI>them.</HI> 'Tis found, too frequently, among the Professing People of GOD, in all Ages of the World. Many complain of the difficult <HI>Times</HI> they live in;—not by way of humble <HI>mourning</HI> for the wickedness of them; but with a manifest Air of Impatience and Discontent under their Trials.</P>
<P>BUT this Spirit commonly exerts itself against the Rulers of God's People, both of a civil and sacred Order. <Q>Either they take too much
<PB N="17" REF="008598_0016_102F94AC30D079A8"/>
upon them; or they are seeking their own Honour, Ease and Profit, and care not what becomes of the People,</Q> are Censures very liberally dealt out, against the Rulers; though like Nehemiah, they are really <HI>come to seek the Welfare of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this is a threatning Disease—For Murmurers are commonly fond of Company. They'll endeavour to instill the same Notions into Others, which they themselves indulge:—Willing to spread the Infection through the whole Body. From whence a general Dis-affec∣tion arises among People. The public Peace is Disturbed. The Duty's of our respective Sta∣tions are neglected. The Cords of Union are broke; and Society on the point of being dis∣banded.—The Influence of Rulers is hereby Obstructed,—their Authority weakned, &amp; their Hearts discouraged. Under which Tryals, if they are not meeker than Moses, they will be provoked to Speak Unadvisedly with their Lips. All which tends to kindle the Anger of GOD against a People.</P>
<P>THUS when they Murmured against Moses and Aaron, the Lord resented the Affront as of∣fered to himself: and accordingly took Ven∣geance upon the Murmuring Israelites. Their Carcases fell in the Wilderness; or they died of the Pestilence and Plague. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 29, 37.</P>
<P>Now <HI>these things happened to them for En∣samples, and they are written for our admonition,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="008598_0017_102F94B07A374260"/>
says Paul.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 10, 11.</NOTE> Therefore the Apostle solemnly warned Christians against this daring presump∣tuous Sin, ver. 10. <HI>neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the Destroyer.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A Spirit of Evil surmising.</HI> This is for a Man to imagine, or uncharitably Suspect some evil thing against his Neighbour, when he has no rational Evidence or ground to support it. Directly contrary to the Law of GOD,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zech. 8. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Let none of you imagine Evil in your heart against his Neighbour: which thing I hate saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>[The Mischief that it does, both in Church and State is manifest; in that when Neighbours are possessed with this foul Spirit of Evil Sur∣mising, their Countenance towards each other is soon changed: their Affections grow cold: their mutual Confidence is shaken, and all the Cords of Friendship broke. <HI>For 'tis cruel as the Grave.</HI> This mischief it does, while it re∣mains imprisoned within the narrow bounds of a mans Own heart. But it will not be confined,—It breaks out and runs at large.]</P>
<P>FOR a Surmising Spirit, is <HI>an unruly</HI> Evil, <HI>full of deadly Poison.</HI> It will venture to cast its ve∣nemous Darts at the Wisest, the Greatest and best of Men, in Church and State; to the ruin∣ing of their Characters and Usefulness in the World. There may be nothing at first, per∣haps, but a simple surmise. Or a <HI>word</HI> that
<PB N="19" REF="008598_0018_102F94B7504F1C20"/>
was spoken, may be mistaken; or an <HI>Action</HI> done, may be misreprented: and then a sur∣mising spirit has Art and Ill Nature enough to dress it up in the blackest Colours, ready for the Use of a slandering Tongue. 'Tis reported as something <HI>real</HI> and very <HI>criminal.</HI> It passes current from Hand to Hand, increasing as it goes; until it becomes an <HI>horrible thing,</HI> no longer to be endured.—Upon this the clamour of Tongues is raised against the Man of Cha∣racter and Station: and whether he be really innocent or guilty, it makes no odds,—they have no Leisure nor Will to enquire after Truth: but lift up their Voices, with one accord, &amp; cry "away with such a one from the Earth"—Away with him from his Seat of Honour and Trust; for it is not fitting that he should live in it any longer.</P>
<P>HOWEVER they may be awed with the Pre∣sence of Superiors, and afraid of speaking to their Faces; they are not ashamed to surmise the hardest things against them, nor yet to re∣port the black Falsehood; if they may do it with Impunity, or under the shadow of a mul∣titude. They stick not to <HI>revile the Gods, nor to curse the Rulers of the People. So presump∣tuous are they and self willed, they are not afraid to speak Evil of Dignities.</HI> By this Means the Community is Wounded in her Head,—depri∣ved of her most able and useful Members and Weakned in all her Parts: besides the Curse
<PB N="20" REF="008598_0019_102F94B8E2494090"/>
of GOD that falls upon surmising Hearts and reviling Tongues.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal 120. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Behold how great a mat∣ter a little Fire kindleth!</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>CARNAL Confidence, or trusting in the Creature, is another dangerous Disease.</HI>—.</P>
<P>[When People look no higher than to crea∣ture Refuge, fetching all their Hope &amp; Spirit from such feeble things as themselves &amp; Crea∣tures about them, 'tis evident they do then cast off the Lord, and foolishly trust in their own sufficiency.

<P>[THE Light of the Gospel is sent down from the great Son of Righteousness, to enrich the Minds of Men with the Knowledge of GOD's Will,—to shew them the Beauty of Holiness &amp; the Deformity of Sin,—the Happiness of One and the Miseries of the Other. The <HI>Grace</HI> of

<P>Now, if under all these Advantages and pow∣erful Motives to Holiness, People can find a Heart to practice Wickedness,—Giving in to Covetousness, Injustice, Oppression &amp; Fraud,—Indulging the Lusts of the Flesh, Intemperance, Gluttony &amp; Drunkenness, or Excess of Wine,—Wallowing in Uncleanness, Chambering and Wantonness,—Foaming out their own shame, by horrid Swearing, foul and filthy Language▪ Lying, Stealing, with many other works of Darkness: and to compleat the Catalogue, are hardy enough to trample under Foot the Law of the Sabbath, bidding Farewell to all Religion. If such things as these are found prevailing a∣mong a privileged People, <HI>'tis certain</HI> that their Destruction hastens on apace,—there is out another step betwixt them and Death. For <HI>these</HI> are capital Vices, shewing that the <HI>Guilty</HI> are abandoned to Ingratitude and Presumption.</P>
<P>AND, besides the Physical Tendency of these

<P>This brings me to the,</P>

CHRIST JESUS: Very agreeable to what t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Prophet Isaiah had said,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa 53. 5.</NOTE> <HI>With his stripes we are healed.</HI> Which is applyed to CHRIST by the Apostle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Who his own self bare our sins in his own Body on the Tree,</HI>—<HI>by whose stripes ye were healed▪</HI> So that CHRIST JESUS is the great Physician, the Healer of his People. And 'tis as plain that his Blood is the Balm or Me∣dicine, by which he performs the Cure. For says the Prophet, 'tis <HI>with his stripes,</HI> that he <HI>heals;</HI>—implying his Blood and Sufferings for our sins. As the Apostle explains it,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 1. 7.</NOTE> <HI>The Blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.</HI>—We may hence conclude that our Prophet had a higher Look than to the Top of Gilead, when he cry'd for Balm and sought a Physician to heal the Daughter of his People; whose Sickness was, more especially, of a Spiritual &amp; Political Nature. Doubtless the words are designed to point us to the Lord Jesus, as the only Physician, and to his Blood, as the Balm or only Remedy for the healing of a Sinful People. 'Tis true, there are other Means and Instruments, of spe∣cial Service, in these spiritual Cases: but they are all in Subordination to Christ. They <HI>heal,</HI> only as they help the Patient to Christ, or lead him to the Open Fountain of his Blood; with∣out which there is no Remission or healing of Sin.</P>
<P>But <HI>how</HI> the Lord Jesus heals his People

with his Blood? is a proper Enquiry, in this place, and must be Answered.</P>
<P>HAVING, in our nature, performed a sinless Obedience to all the Commands of GOD, CHRIST JESUS, in our Behalf, submitted to Death; <HI>Death</HI> including the whole of that Punishment, which, by Law, was due to the Transgressors of it.

Firmament, sends forth its benign Influences, upon good and bad; willing to make all about us happy. Again,</P>
<P>THIS Spirit anoints their Eyes and gives them to see the Hand of God, in all Events of Provi∣dence; and sweetly disposes them to acquiesce <HI>in,</HI> or submit <HI>to</HI> all that he does, as <HI>wisest</HI> and <HI>best,</HI> upon the whole: and hereby a <HI>Murmuring Spi∣rit</HI> is put to silence.—<HI>Above all things they put on Charity, the Bond of Perfectness,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Col. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Which thinketh no Evil, rejoyceth not in Iniquity, but hopeth all things,</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 13▪ 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> whereby a Spirit of <HI>Evil Surmising</HI> is effectually prevented or healed. <HI>For Charity covereth a multitude of sins.</HI>—Moreover, They have been so effectually convinc'd of their own Nothingness; together with the Uncer∣tainty &amp; Insufficiency of all creature Aids; and of the absolute Dependance of all Events upon the Sovereign Pleasure and Agency of Heaven, that they have learned, not to glory in Wisdom, Strength or Riches, <HI>but only in the Lord;</HI> and so are delivered from <HI>Carnal Confidence.</HI></P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P>A Sight of the divine Perfections, in the love∣ly Face of Jesus, shewing forth the Beauty of Holiness; accompany'd with the substantial Pleasures of true Godliness, has given them such an Abhorrence of <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Wickedness,</HI> that they could not find a Heart to indulge it, even if they might do it with Impunity. <HI>How can I do this</HI>

<HI>great Wickedness, and sin against God:</HI> And thus of all other evil Diseases, whereby the De∣struction of a People is threatned.—They are healed by this great Physician from Heaven, <HI>whose name was called</HI> JESUS, <HI>because he saves his People from their Sins,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. 1. 21.</NOTE> With the precious Balm of his Blood, the Gospel Catholicon, or universal Remedy.—Hence the true People of God,—the Children and Followers of his Son, have learned thus to pray,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Jer. 17. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Heal us O Lord, and we shall be healed: save us and we shall be saved.</HI></P>
<P>I am now come to the last general Head pro∣posed. Which was to shew</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>THE deep Concern which all the Members of Community, and especially such as are in Places of Trust, should manifest in seeking the Public Health.</HI></P>
<P>[THAT Man is a dependant Creature, not only upon GOD his Creator, but also upon his Fellow Men: being form'd, not to live &amp; act alone; but in Fellowship with his Brethren: all united together, in a Body or Community, by certain Bonds: held and directed by certain Laws and Rules; under the Influence and Au∣thority of proper Officers; in a just &amp; beauti∣ful Gradation, from the Head to the Foot: and this for the well Being of the whole Body, and the Safety, as well as Comfort of every In∣dividual, is a Subject that hath been so often
<PB N="32" REF="008598_0031_102F94DD73854138"/>
handled upon this Occasion: and the Necessity of it, especially in our lapsed state, so well sup∣ported, that I need do no more than mention it. And from hence it appears, that every Mem∣ber of this important Body, should hold himself Obliged to put on a Public Spirit, and to exert himself, upon all Occasions, to promote its Welfare. For the Safety and Welfare of the Public, is, not only his Own, out his Neigh∣bours, his Friends, his Childrens. In that there is such a close Connection between the Body and its Members, that if the Body be well or sick, the Members must be proportionably affected. Now, let the Regard which we have, or <HI>should</HI> have for our Neighbours Welfare, be added to that which we have for our <HI>Own,</HI> and the Ar∣gument, for a public spirit, will be doubly strong. And will yet gather strength, when we View e∣very Individual, of the whole Body, happy or miserable, according as it fares with the Public. So that a true Lover of Mankind, will prefer the public Good and Safety, above his <HI>Own,</HI> personally and separately considered, as much as the whole Body is preferable to any one of its Members. And <HI>this</HI> not only justifies, but inspirits a truly generous Soul, a real Friend of the Public, to sacrifice, not only his own <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Profit,</HI> but his <HI>Life</HI> to his Country's Service; when the safety, or welfare of the Community demands it of him. As it was with Noah, in the Time of the Flood,—the Safety &amp; Well Being
<PB N="33" REF="008598_0032_102F94DF0BE0D138"/>
of <HI>Noah,</HI> his Family and of every living Crea∣ture that was with him, depended upon the Pre∣servation of the <HI>Ark.</HI> If <HI>that</HI> was kept above Water, entire and in a due Position; they were all safe: If it sunk, or was dash'd in pieces, by the Waves; they all perished: Therefore the Preservation of the Ark was of greater Impor∣tance, and, very justly, a Matter of deeper Con∣cern with every Member of the Family, than barely the Preservation of <HI>himself,</HI> as separate from the Ark.—So in the Case before us: Our whole Interest and Safety is embarked in the Public Welfare. And therefore that the Pub∣lic may be preserved safe, in Health &amp; Prospe∣rity, is a Matter of such Vast Importance, as justly demands the first Concern of every incor∣porated Member.—But then, the higher any Ones Station is in the Body; the larger is his Sphere of Action; the more numerous are the Branches of his Duty, and the more extensive is his Influence. So that his Opportunities and Advantages to do good, are in Proportion to the Place he sustains: And on the Other hand, his Failure of Duty, must be proportionably hurtful to the Public, as his Station is higher than his Brethrens. Which shows, that from the Head of a Nation or Province, down to the Master of a Family, our Concern for the Public Good should rise according to the Place which we Occupy. For Reason &amp; Experience teach, that Public Weal or Wo, depends, very much,
<PB N="34" REF="008598_0033_102F94E6ADE67918"/>
upon the good or ill Behaviour of those, that are trusted with her Treasures▪ and that have the Care of conducting the whole Body, as uni∣ted together, or as it excites and acts in it's se∣veral Parts.</P>
<P>OF such a Concern, for the Welfare of Zion and the Civil State, we have an Instance before us; in the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> After his most vigorous Endeavours to save them from Ruin, had prov'd unsuccessfull, he fell into Tears and lamented their pitiful Case: As in the Words immediately following our Text.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>I. <HI>FROM what has been said, it appears that we are a diseased People,</HI>—in a sickly, decaying State. There can be no doubt of this, if the symptoms that have been described, are really to be found upon <HI>us.</HI> And I am very willing to stand corrected, if I mistake the Object, when I fix the Charge of such Disorders, upon the People, whom we this Day represent. If we
<PB N="35" REF="008598_0034_102F94E8CF1A5D10"/>
say that we are innocent: <HI>what meaneth</HI> then, <HI>the Lowing of the Oxen that we bear?</HI> Are not the Fruits of Selfishness and Party Zeal, Mur∣muring, Evil Surmizing and Bitterness, too e∣vidently on the growing hand? Our Bowels begin to be pained with these Diseases; and there is danger lest they end in such Convulsions, as will shake our noble Frame to Pieces. Besides the filthy Vices that are rampart in the Land; bidding Defiance to Heaven and humane Laws, discover that Multitudes are under the Power and Dominion of Sin. Surely the spirit of a dead Sleep must be pour'd out upon us, if we do not <HI>feel, &amp; tremble</HI> at, such Maladies as these.</P>
<P>Nevertheless,</P>
<P>II. <HI>WE may see great Cause of Thankfulness to GOD, for his Wonderful Mercies, amidst our crying Sins.</HI> It well becomes the Sick to speak of the Mercies of GOD towards them, in the time of their Affliction. We should therefore bless the Lord, that under all the threatning symptoms that attend us, we are not only spar'd, but indulged with a thousand Blessings; which Gratitude obliges me to mention, though time would fail me to enumerate.</P>
<P>How shall we utter the Mercies of GOD's Goodness to our Land, in <HI>setting up his Stand∣ard against our Enemies, when they broke in upon us like a Flood.</HI> When <HI>the Sorrows of Death compassed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about and the Floods of Un∣godly Men</HI> (terrified and) <HI>made us afraid, then,</HI>

<HI>in our Distress. we called upon the Lord, &amp; cry∣ed unto our GOD. Lord save us for thy Mer∣cies sake. Give us Help from Trouble, for the Help of Man is vain. He heard our voice out of his Temple,</HI> above, <HI>and our Cry came before him even into his Ears.—Then did GOD arise and Scatter our Enemies: he made them that hated us to flee before us</HI> He either <HI>sent Faintness into their Hearts, so that the Sound of a shaken Leaf did Chase them:</HI> Or if they met our Troops in the Field, they were smitten down before them. The Plains of <HI>Abraham</HI> can testify, that <HI>there the stout hearted were spoiled. They slept their sleep and none of the Men of Might could find their Hands.</HI> The Lord has brought us, thro' a Field of Blood, into the strong City QUEBIC, the Capital of our Enemies Country; to set up his own Worship <HI>there,</HI> where Saints &amp; Images had been long adored. A glorious, but a cost∣ly Acquisition! <HI>Glorious;</HI> as it was Obtained by unequal Numbers, with a Firmness and Reso∣lution, scarcely to be equalled. <HI>Costly,</HI> as the Blood and Life of the bravest General was pre∣cious. The Favour of GOD to this Land, in sending over that accomplish'd Officer, <HI>The Gallant WOLFE,</HI> to defend our Country, is so great and Distinguishing, that, methinks, all Heaven is listening to hear our Acclamations this Day, even Songs of Praise from an Obliged People.

He fell! at the Head of his Troops, commanding with the Wisdom of an Angel, both for their Security and certain Victory; with such an Ardour of Spirit, as made him e'en forget that himself was Mortal.</P>
<P>O Daughters of Jerusalem! Weep ye over WOLFE, the the young, the generous and the tender hearted Man! the bold, intrepid Warriour: who under GOD, has saved <HI>you</HI> from barbarous Hands, and your <HI>little Ones</HI> from being dashed against the Stones. And let us all, with grateful Hearts, unite, in raising, over his Grave, a Monument, that shall endure, when Statutes of Marble &amp; Brass shall be moul∣der'd into Dust: <HI>by shewing to our Children and the Generation to come, the Praises of the Lord: and his Wonderful Works that he has done,</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. 78. 4.</NOTE> by the Hand of this Mighty Man: that the Generation, which is yet unborn, <HI>may arise and declare them to their Children,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">v. 6.</NOTE> carefully handing down his precious name to the latest Ages, <HI>that his Memory may never perish.</HI></P>

I cannot now speak of Health and Plenty, and all the Riches of Gospel Grace, with Number∣less other Blessings, that Heaven is raining down upon us: which, did we rightly improve, to the Glory of GOD, the Giver, we might, this Day congratulate our Country in the Language of <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Israel,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">† Deut. 33 29</NOTE> <HI>Happy art thou, O New-England! who is like unto thee, O People saved by the Lord, the Shield of thy Help and the Sword of thy Excellency!</HI> Glory to the Great Indul∣gent Being, who has bid his Patience Wait the Returns of another Anniversary; which opens with so fair a Prospect, on many Accounts; giving of us some ground to hope, that Heaven has farther Designs of Mercy towards Us.</P>
<P>BUT there are awful Signs of Judgment be∣fore us, as well as of Mercy: which constrains us to Rejoyce with Trembling For</P>
<P>III. <HI>FROM what we have heard, it ap∣pears that there are many threatning symptoms upon us. There is Danger of GOD's Heavy Judgments▪ for our ungrateful Abuse of his Mercies.</HI> The Judgments of Heaven upon the Land, for several Years together, in Earthquakes, Sickness and Wars, have been the most Awful and A∣wakening, that either We or our Fathers▪ per∣haps, have ever known. And yet we have not <HI>learned Righteousness,</HI> nor turned from our Sins. And the Mercy of GOD, in delivering of us from so many Dangers and Deaths, has certainly
<PB N="39" REF="008598_0038_102F94F5B2855980"/>
been as great as the Judgments themselves which we have survived▪ And yet his Good∣ness has been so far from lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing of us to Re∣pentance, that, like <HI>Pharoah</HI> King of Egypt, <HI>When we saw that there was Respit we harden∣ed our Hearts against him.</HI> And now, after all, in the midst of Blessings, (not without Judg∣ments,) we are setting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own in carnal Security, glorying in our own Sufficiency and boasting of Signal Successes.—So that our Sin, at this Day, is loaded with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se two fearful Aggravations, <HI>Pre∣sumption and Ingratitude.</HI> The <HI>former</HI> bids De∣fiance to the Vengeance of God, and the <HI>latter</HI> despises the Riches of his Goodness.</P>
<P>And now: What can we expect in return for such a foolish and even bruitish Requital of the blessed God? If Mercy and Kindness will not melt us, nor Judgment deter us from Sinning, we may expect that Wrath from the Lord will soon go forth to Devour us. Surely a People are never in greater Danger of speedy Destructi∣on, than when they harden under Judgments and wax Wanton with Mercies. <HI>For as the Earth which drinketh in the Rain that cometh oft upon it, but beareth Thorns and Briars, is re∣jected, and is nigh unto Cursing.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. 6. 7, 8.</NOTE> So it is with a People that contemn the Judgments and abuse the Mercies of the Lord:—Some Curse of God is ready to fall upon them. The holy Scriptures teach us to Reason thus.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ezra 9. 13, 14.</NOTE> <HI>Seeing that thou our</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="008598_0039_102F94F7467A4788"/>
<HI>God hast punished us less than our Iniquities de∣serve, and hast given us such Deliverance as this. Should we again break thy Commandments, wouldst thou not be Angry with us, till thou hadst consu∣med us, so that there should be no Remnant nor Escaping?</HI></P>
<P>['Tis certainly provoking to God, to see his his People so Careless, as we are, in general, under his solemn, remarkable Goings.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mal. 2▪ 2.</NOTE> <HI>If ye will not lay it to Heart, to give Glory unto my Name, saith the Lord of Hosts, I will even send a Curse upon you and I will Curse your Blessings: yea I have Cursed them already; because ye do not lay it to Heart.</HI> Since it is not for our Righteousness, that the Lord has so remarka∣bly Blessed us: but he has pityed &amp; spared us, for his own Name sake; Therefore, as Joshua admonished Israel,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joshua 23, 15▪</NOTE> <HI>It shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon us, so shall the Lord bring upon us all evil things, until he hath destroyed us.</HI>] And<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Chap 24. 20.</NOTE> <HI>If ye forsake the Lord and serve strange Gods, then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</HI> Thus we see our Danger.—It remains then, that we all wake up and shew our Zeal for God, and Regard for our own and others Safety, by promoring a speedy and thorough Reformation.—Which leads to another Use,</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Our Text and Discourse teach us that 'tis the Duty of every one, in our respective Places,
<PB N="41" REF="008598_0040_102F94FAC973B550"/>
to seek earnestly after the Recovery of public Health.</HI> Though CHRIST is the only Physician, &amp; his Blood the healing Remedy▪ yet our GOD ho∣nours the <HI>Great</HI> and the <HI>Small,</HI> among his Peo∣ple, with the Office of <HI>Helpers</HI> together with Him: and reproves such as do not <HI>come in to the Help of the LORD, in</HI> a work that so near∣ly concerns them. Wherefore, as in repaiting the Walls of Jerusalem, all Ranks of Men were engag'd in the work▪ from their excel∣lent Governour, down to Mechanicks, and com∣mon Labourers, so should we be all Hands at Work, in healing and reforming every Disor∣der; that Sin has brought upon the Community whose dangerous Sickness calls aloud for spee∣dy Help.</P>
<P>I would therefore humbly address the Coun∣sel of Heaven this day, to the whole Con∣gregation: and more especially to the Legis∣lative Body of this People: beseeching their powerful Assistance in healing, i. e. reforming the dangerous Evils that have been described, and all others that prevail against us. And</P>
<P>I. <HI>TO the Honourable, the</HI> GOVERNOUR, DEPUTY GOVERNOUR, and ASSISTANTS <HI>of the Colony.</HI></P>
<P>You are very sensible, my honoured Fathers▪ that your Relation to the Body leads you, very naturally, to view your selves in a Twofold Light. As Rulers, set to govern and direct
<PB N="42" REF="008598_0041_102F9500829EC6C0"/>
the People. you have the Care of the whole Community upon you: which must fill your Minds with a deep Concern for their Welfare. But then, as Men, you are Members of the same Body, which, as <HI>Magistrates</HI> you govern: and so, are subject to the same Laws, bound to the same Duty, and liable to the same Dis∣eases with your Brethren: which makes you stand in need of the same Physician and Reme∣dy as they do.—Now both these Characters, of <HI>Rulers</HI> &amp; <HI>Members,</HI> meeting in the same Person, brings a double Portion of Care and Concern upon you, for the Health of the Public.—'T was therefore with good Reason that Jethro advised his Son Moses,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Exod. 18. 21.</NOTE> <HI>To provide out of all the People, Able Men, such as fear GOD, Men of Truth; Hating Covetousness, and to place such over them, to be Rulers.</HI> And such it be∣hoves you, Sirs, to be, both for your Own and People's safety. For should Rulers be car∣ry'd away with Covetousness &amp; Love of them∣selves: Should <HI>they</HI> warp from the Truth, or be corrupted with the Vices of the Times: and, under all their Own and Peoples Guilt, should they fall asleep in their Chairs, insensible of Dan∣ger; what a deplorable Situation would the dependant Body be in! Should <HI>they</HI> unhappily err in Judgement, or stumble &amp; fail, with the whole Community upon their Shoulders, our Life or Limbs would be in imminent Danger.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="008598_0042_102F9503E161E218"/>
IT therefore concerns you, Honoured Sirs, to take good heed to your selves, in the first Place; that, like Obadiah, <HI>you fear the LORD greatly:</HI>—Trust in him firmly and walk Closely with him: that you yourselves may be in per∣fect Health, and better able to minister to your diseased People: lest they say, <HI>Physician, heal thy self.</HI> To strengthen your Hands and en∣gage your Hearts in this important work of Reforming what is amiss among us, it may be of great Service, that you daily think of the lof∣ty <HI>Titles</HI> &amp; awful <HI>Characters,</HI> with which you are honoured in the Scriptures. <HI>I have said ye are gods,</HI> says the Psalmist, To remind you of the constant, tender Care you should take of your Peoples Health: And to suggest, that, for Wisdom, Righteousness, Impartiality▪ &amp; Steady Conduct, your Administration, should be a lively Image &amp; Transcript of GOD's unerring Government of the World.</P>
<P>YOU <HI>are also Revengers to execute wrath up∣on him that doth evil.</HI> Which being executed with Solemnity, in the Fear of GOD, will make you a Terror to evil doers: and at the same time the Guardians of the Innocent: and upon the whole, <HI>the Ministers of GOD for good to his People.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that which adds the greatest weight to Rulers Administrations is, <HI>Their Godly Example.</HI> They should be <HI>holy as GOD is holy,</HI> &amp; <HI>merci∣ful as GOD is.</HI> This will convince their People,
<PB N="44" REF="008598_0043_102F95057B628F78"/>
that <HI>they themselves</HI> believe that what they re∣quire of them, <HI>are sacred Realities.</HI>—Matters of the highest Importance.</P>
<P>IT also becomes our Civil Fathers to be <HI>Zealous</HI> in the work of Reformation. Your Peoples Sins should deeply affect your Hearts, and make you resolve, if possible, to heal them. But if unsucces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>full after all; you should spread their Case before the Lord, and become fervent Intercessors for them before the Throne of Grace. Thus did Moses, David, Ezra, Nehemiah and other godly Rulers. And tho' your Sword may not reach the Heart of Sin, nor convert Sinners to GOD, yet your Prayers may reach Heaven and enter into the Ears of the Lord: Who has many a Time repented of the Evil which he tho't to do unto his People, for their Sins, and done it not; in answer to the godly Rulers Prayers. <HI>Exod.</HI> 32. 14.</P>
<P>[YOU'LL please, my very Honoured Fathers, to consider, how dependant we all are upon you. Tho' guilty of much undutiful Carriage towards you,—like peevish Children are too apt to murmur and complain,—to raise Parties against you: and boldly rush upon the Point of your Sword, by daring Impieties, yet our Eyes are upon you for Succour and Protection. We run to you for Help, in all our Straits, as Children to their Fathers. We hover about you in times of Danger, that we may be shel∣ter'd under your Wing.—We look upon you,
<PB N="45" REF="008598_0044_102F95071DD0A120"/>
as the most noble Parts of the Body,—the most honourable among the Members. You are our <HI>Eyes</HI> to see for us,—to espy Danger, and choose out our way of Escape:—Our <HI>Head</HI> to plan and contrive for our Welfare:—Our <HI>Ears</HI> to hear the Complaints of the Oppressed:—Our <HI>Hands</HI> &amp; <HI>Arms</HI> to Defend us. In a word, Sirs, You are our very <HI>Heart</HI> to feel our Wants and to devise liberal things for us.—Therefore let not our ungrateful Carriage to GOD and You be punished with your neglect of us, in this our Sickly, dying State: but let our Danger and our Wo excite your most servent endea∣vours and draw forth the best of your; Skill to heal and save us: that you may ever live in our Hearts as, under GOD, the Deliverers of a People, on the Brink of Ruin.]</P>
<P>YOU are very Sansible of the Danger that attends the Community, at this Day, not only on Account of the common Vices of Sensuality and Profaneness, that bring GOD's Judgements upon us; but also by reason of a <HI>Selfish, divi∣ding, party-Spirit;</HI> that strives to make it's way thro' the Land: threatning like a Bear, to rend us in Pieces. And your <HI>Honours</HI> are not only in Danger <HI>by it,</HI> but in Danger <HI>of it.</HI> For if this Evil Spirit prevails and becomes reputable, your Posts of Honour and Trust will not be <HI>hold</HI> by Merit, nor <HI>lost</HI> for want of Abilities to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll them. Should the Freemen of the Colony be actuated by a Party Spirit, they will become
<PB N="46" REF="008598_0045_102F950D39BB7AE0"/>
as Sovereign as Nebuchadnezzar, King of Ba∣bylon; <HI>whom they will they'll kill, and whom they will they'll keep alive,</HI> to promote their party Interest. Therefore, take heed my Fa∣thers, that you connive not at any Iniquity, merely to favour a Party, and to gain their Voice in Elections: but nobly scorn the Suf∣frages of those that would set you up, not for the public Good, but only to Serve a Turn.</P>
<P>LET the Health of the Community be the grand Object of your Attention; and pursue it, in all the ways of Righteousness, whether you meet the Frowns or Smiles of the multitude: who will be asham'd when they see you uncapable of being corrupted—As <HI>gods</HI> therefore, be Wise,—be Pati∣ent,—Steady, bold &amp; valiant for the Truth, re∣specting the public Good: and leave the Event with GOD, whose Eyes are upon the faithful of the Land: and you shall not loose your Re∣ward. Then will you <HI>live</HI> desired, at least by the best of your People, &amp; <HI>die</HI> lamented. We shall rejoyce in your Light and rest securely un∣der your Shadow, while you live: and when you leave us, by Death, our Tears shall Wit∣ness, how precious your Memory is held and how carefully preserved.—As a Proof of our high Esteem &amp; Affection for such pious, steady and faithful Rulers, the Whole Country joins you, Our Honoured Fathers, in Condoling <HI>Your</HI> Loss and <HI>Ours,</HI> by the awful Breach that GOD has made upon the Magistracy, in the

Death of that truely Great and Worthy Man, the Honourable ROGER WOLCOTT, junr. <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> As He was one of our Principal Pillars of State, we felt the Shock of his Fall; and shall long mourn his Departure, with a grateful Sense of his eminent Services: in Memory of which his Merit constrains me to say, (as I conclude I may with all Simplicity,) that,</P>
<P><Q>HE was endowed from on high with a Genius &amp; Abilities, Surpassing the common Size,—of considerable Reading and Acquire∣ments,—throughly Studied in the Law,—well acquainted with the Interest and Wel∣fare of the Colony and a last Friend to it,—an able Statesman and worthy Patriot.—In these elevated Stations of Honour and Trust He held in the Government, He acquitted himself very honourably to himself, &amp; to the admiring Acceptance and great Advantage of the Public,—Of unstai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Probity and Integrity,—inflexible to Ill and obstinately just,—free from Artifice and Disguise, frank, open hearted, and determined in speaking and acting for the publick Good,—his stea∣dy Soul not warp'd or turned aside from the grand Point in View, the public Good, by the Frowns or Smiles of the unthinking Multitude. And, what Spreads a Glory o∣ver his Character, he was esteemed a Gen∣tleman of real unaffected Religion.</Q>—But his Breath was in his Nostrils,—he could not,

with all his Furniture, resist the King of Ter∣rors. <HI>Behold the Lord of Hosts has taken away the Judge,—the Prudent,—the honourable Man and the Counsellour.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 3. 2 3.</NOTE> GOD grant that he may live, as to all his Accomplishments, in his Suc∣cessor: And may a double Portion of the good Spirit rest upon all our Worthy Magistrates: who are to remember that they also are Mortal and Accountable to the Judge of all.—Men of such enlarged Hearts &amp; capacious, steady Minds as <HI>He,</HI> are absolutely needed at the Helm, in this tempestuous Season. And <HI>Such</HI> we trust, your Honours will more Abundantly prove your selves than ever.—The Greatness of your Souls will appear, with a shining Lustre, in a Christian Fortitude, and Resignation to the So∣vereign Disposer of the Lot,—meeting afresh the <HI>Honours</HI> of the Day, without <HI>Elation:</HI> or the Neglect of an Obliged People, as free from Perturbation or Pressure of Spirit.</P>
<P>II. THE Address may be directed <HI>to the Honourable House of Representatives.</HI></P>
<P>GENTLEMEN: The Wounds of the Body, in its distant and various parts, are well known to you all. And as they should deeply Affect your Hearts, so they call for your speedy and Fervent Assistance.</P>
<P>YOU, Sirs, may do much for the healing of our Diseases, &amp; that in many ways.—Volum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of
<PB N="49" REF="008598_0048_102F95141D7C4B48"/>
Good Laws for the suppressing of Vice and re∣forming Disorders, will fail of their End, if the Execution of them falls into Unskillful or Un∣faithful Hands. And this is too often the Case, in some of your Towns: which makes the Wicked so bold and impudent; walking as if there was no Law nor Authority over them.</P>
<P>IT therefore concerns You, Worthy Sirs, to propose and choose such Men <HI>Only</HI> for the Com∣mission of the Peace, in your respective Counties and Towns, as are, not only equal to the Post, for <HI>Abilities,</HI> but Men that truely <HI>fear God,</HI> and are not afraid of the Face of Man. They should be Men of great and approved <HI>Sobriety,</HI> walking Steadily in all GOD's Ordinances: that their Sentence against Transgressors may fall with Weight and Terror. And such as have been criminally delinquent, in times past, should be faithfully reproved by you, and reclaimed, or dismissed from their Places: least▪ Iniquity▪ encouraged by their Example, should boldly contemn the Authority of their Office.</P>
<P>ONCE more, Gentlemen; Consider the Cha∣racter in which you appear at the General As∣sembly—REPRESENTATIVES of the FREEMEN or Towns that send you: plainly suggesting, that your Business here, is not merely to pro∣mote your <HI>personal Honour</HI> or <HI>Interest,—that</HI> is what you gave up to the Public, when you ac∣cepted the Choice. You are therefore to look at the Health of your Constituents,—the Towns
<PB N="50" REF="008598_0049_102F951ADE190848"/>
from which you come: and seek the Welfare of those Societies. And yet a more important Object rises here in your View, The Good of the whole Community or Colony, of which your Towns are but Parts or Members, as you your selves are of <HI>them.</HI> Yea, the Welfare of the whole Country and Kingdom, is to be thought of and promoted by you. And if the Freemen acted with Understanding and worthy of their Character, in their Appointment of you to this Trust, they gave up the particular Interest of their Towns, and lodg'd it in your Hands, to be managed in such a Manner, <HI>at</HI> and <HI>by</HI> the Assembly, as should be judged most for the Health of the whole Body. Therefore, on the whole, I beseech you to cast off a narrow, con∣tracted Spirit,—spread your Thoughts abroad through the whole Community: and, with deep Concern, endeavour to recover the Health, (both in Church and State,) of a Diseased and languishing People.</P>
<P>III. To <HI>the Freemen of the Colony</HI>—I beseech your earnest Attention, that, if possible, our Health may be recovered.</P>
<P>[VERY great and precious are your Privi∣leges, both civil and religious. If once they are lost, <HI>they cannot be gotten for Gold, neither shall Silver be weighed for the Price of them.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job. 28. 15.</NOTE> See that you rightly understand wherein they
<PB N="51" REF="008598_0050_102F951E8D7D3B58"/>
consist, that you may teach the Knowledge of them to your Children, for their early Im∣provement.]</P>
<P>'TIS of vast Importance. Gentlemen, that you Seriously consider the Relation you stand in to the whole Body—that you are Members of a most Valuable Community▪ and so, Mem∣bers one of another; bound by solemn Bonds to promote the best Good of the Public.—And then, with great Attention, endeavour to inform and assure yourselves, What is the Public Good, what is really for the Health of the Body, the People in general. And that which is So, must be the Object of your Pursuit. For <HI>this</HI> you must give up your personal Interest, wherein∣soever it interferes with the public: account∣ing of it your greatest Happiness and Safety, that the Body, of which you are Members, is in perfect Health.—This will prevent or cure you of a <HI>Party Spirit,</HI> which, if it rises to a reigning Power among us, (as there is great Danger) will prove as certain Death to the Body, as a Mortification in the Bowels.</P>
<P>BEWARE that you Indulge not an <HI>evil Sur∣mise</HI> against any one. Give not yourselves up entirely to the Influence of Others: not care∣lesly act upon Vulgar Report, but be at Pains to acquaint yourselves with Persons &amp; Things, that you may not act in the Dark. And then, with sound Judgment, and from a Principle of Conscience, Choose you out and keep in Posts
<PB N="52" REF="008598_0051_102F952027532B50"/>
of Trust, such Men, to rule over you and to represent you, as you do soberly believe will serve the true Interest of the Public, with the greatest Fidelity and to the best Advantage.</P>
<P>IN a word: be always tender of the Public,—the Colony's Interest.—This is a beautiful and respectable Government: Second to none per∣haps, in New-England, for Situation, Liberty, public Credit, Royal Favour, Religion and many Other Advantages. Let us therefore take Heed, that we don't marr the Beauty nor tarnish the Glory of such a comely Body, by abusing our Liberties: I beseech you beware least you besmear this lovely Face, with the infernal Spot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Discord, Strife and Division, the cursed Offspring of Enmity and a narrow selfish Spirit, fermenting into a party Zeal.</P>
<P>ONCE more, be careful and make Conscience of appointing Such to the town Offices of Grand∣jury-Men, Tithing men, &amp;c. in your respective Towns, as shall be faithful in their Places,—Watching over and informing against notorious Offenders. For 'tis greatly Owing to the criminal Neglect of such Officers, that Wick∣edness so openly abounds in many Parts of the Land.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>To Heads of Families.</HI>—It nearly con∣cerns <HI>you,</HI> to be zealous, in helping of us to reform the Evils of the Day. Families are little Nurseries of Learning, Piety and good
<PB N="53" REF="008598_0052_102F95270308A450"/>
Manners, or of Ignorance, Profanity and Impu∣dence. <HI>Here</HI> we are formed to do much Good, or equal Hurt to the Community, of which we are Members. And therefore the greatest Care is incumbent upon Heads of Families, to teach and rule their Houses well. But alas for them! many are so Void of Knowledge and Skill, in the whole Affair of good Education, as it lies, not only in <HI>Teaching,</HI> but <HI>Governing</HI> and <HI>Disciplining</HI> their Houses; and so insensible of the vast Importance of it, that their Children, being neglected, come forth into the World, destitute of all good Furniture to Serve either God or their Country. Others that know bet∣ter, are, many of them, criminally Slothful and Negligent.—So that through the Weakness of some and the Carelessness of other Parents, We have but an uncomfortable Prospect, as to a great Part of the rising Generation; more es∣pecially in some Parts of the Land. For Zi∣on's Sake then, I beseech all of you, that are Parents, and Masters of Houses, Awake and come in to the Help of the Lord. Put forth your most zealous Endeavours to reform the threatning Evils that are daily growing up be∣fore your Eyes.—Think, how inconsistent it is, with the tender Love you feel for your Children, that you do so little for their best Good in this Life, or for their future, eternal Happiness.</P>
<P>Many Parents and Masters of Families, would, I believe, do more and better, <HI>if they knew how;</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="008598_0053_102F952A3380EFC0"/>
and were sensible that a good Family-Education, in the true Meaning &amp; full Extent of it, is almost <HI>The All,</HI> as to their own and the public Health. But, as I apprehend, they want further Means to awake their Attention and Zeal, in this Affair, as also to guide them in the Work. I would therefore return to the General Assembly as Fa∣thers of the Land, and humbly propose,</P>
<P>WHETHER it is not a Matter, weighty eno' to employ your serious Thoughts afresh, that something further be done for the Help of Fa∣milies, that their Children may be trained up in the Way they should go?—And to this End, take leave to propose, that a short, plain and easy Treatise upon the Subject of Education and Family Government, might be speedily prepar'd: And such a Number of the Books distributed to each Town, that every Family may have One, and the <HI>Poor</HI> have them gratis.</P>
<P>V. <HI>I may not pass by our Worthy Colonels and Officers in the Army;</HI> Who have precious Op∣portunities, and many singular Advantages, to Reform the Vices of the Field, and thereby to do much at Healing the Land.</P>
<P>HONOURED and much esteemed Gentlemen: Your Loyalty to your earthly Sovereign is in∣indisputable;—Your Zeal in your Country's Service is known to us all, and gratefully ac∣knowledged; your Courage and Bravery of Spirit has been tryed and proved: and finally
<PB N="55" REF="008598_0054_102F952BE3F02260"/>
you are Professors of our Holy Religion.—'Tis therefore justly expected of you, and we beseech you, Gentlemen, with all your accom∣plishments, to help us in reforming the Man∣ners of our dear Brethren and precious Sons, who are committed to your care. Improve the Advantages of your high Rank in subdu∣ing the Vices of the Army.</P>
<P>You worthily resent the Affronts that are offer'd to your Persons, and are sensibly mov'd when your own Honour is touched. You very justly punish Rebellion and Disloyalty, with Stripes, Confinement or Death, as a whole∣some and necessary Discipline. But what are these Offences against your Persons, Offices or earthly Sovereign, compar'd with the horrid Affronts that are daily offer'd to the GOD of Heaven, the King of Zion, by the filthy Blas∣phemys &amp; daring Impieties of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>med Sol∣diers?—Therefore, as Gentlemen of true Ho∣nour and greatness of Soul, it becomes you to manifest the highest Resentment for Injuries done to your GOD, the King of Kings. It will be nobly done of you, if, rising above the Fear of Man, you make your Zeal and Courage known among the Troops, in reproving and scourging out the Immoralities of the Army. For hereby you will conquer the most nume∣rous &amp; formidable Enemies that we have to fear. And then, if you fall in Battle with the common foe, it will be in a Blaze of Glory: Or if you
<PB N="56" REF="008598_0055_102F952ED3D63B58"/>
return Victorious from the Field, it will be with double Honour to <HI>your selves,</HI> and with the greatest rejoicings to <HI>us;</HI> who, with Glad∣ness of Heart, will join you in Songs of Tri∣umph for Enemies Conquered and Vices Sub∣du'd.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>THE Discourse may▪ with the greatest Propriety,</HI> be <HI>address'd to the Ministers of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>MY Reverend and Dearly beloved Brethren. Since we by Office, <HI>are set to Watch for Mens Souls,</HI> As accountable to GOD for them, We above all Men in the World, should be con∣cerned for their Health; And especially at such a Day as <HI>this,</HI> when Multitudes are even Wounded to Death, but insensible of their Danger; Yea, when <HI>grey Hairs are here and upon the</HI> People <HI>and they know it not.</HI>—What can we do for the Health of the Daughter of Zion? Surely Our best Offices are both <HI>her</HI> Due and <HI>our</HI> Duty. To this I would say, that as ever we mean to heal and save a Diseased People, we must in the first place,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Preach GOD's Word faithfully.</HI>—GOD's Word of Truth, as revealed in the Scriptures, is the great Instrument or Means, in the Hand of his Ministers, by which they perform all their Cures. Hereby Sinners are converted,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jam. 1. 18.</NOTE> and Saints Sanctify'd,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">John 14. 19.</NOTE> But then, divine Truths
<PB N="57" REF="008598_0056_102F9530CAED16B0"/>
are healing, only as they bring Sinners to CHRIST, the great Physician, as before obser∣ved. And in Order to perswade Souls to CHRIST for <HI>healing,</HI> they must be made sen∣sible that they are <HI>Sick.</HI> For the <HI>Whole need not the Physician,</HI> (such wont come to CHRIST) <HI>but they that are Sick</HI>—Our first Concern there∣fore should be, to convince People of their Sickness,—to open their Wounds, shew them their Disease, and make them sensible of their absolute need of CHRIST to heal them. This is done by shewing them, from the Word of GOD, <HI>their lost Estate by Nature.</HI> That they are not only Guilty of breaking the Whole Law▪ in <HI>Practice,</HI> but that they are by <HI>Nature</HI> an <HI>Unclean Thing.</HI> [That they are not as A∣dam when he came first out of the Hand of GOD, bearing his Image <HI>in Holiness:</HI> but as <HI>Adam</HI> in his fallen State; bearing an Image op∣posite to <HI>that</HI> in which Man was created: as is fairly intimated Gen. 5. 1, 3. And so that their Nature, in this fallen State, is] wholly corrupt, interwoven with Lusts,—averse to GOD and Holiness, having no good thing dwelling in them. We must labour to convince them, as the Scriptures declare, that they are without Righteousness and Strength,—utterly unable to help themselves, and as unworthy of any Help or Favour from GOD: And so, that they lie <HI>at Mercy,</HI>—Sovereign Mercy.</P>
<P>ON the whole, Sinners must be shown, that
<PB N="58" REF="008598_0057_102F9536A25FDDA0"/>
this Corrupt Nature, called, <HI>The Old Man, must be crucified with CHRIST,</HI> and <HI>this Body of Sin destroyed,</HI> or elle they can never be deliver∣ed <HI>from the service of Sin,</HI> as St. Paul Insisted, Rom. 6, 6. And finally, that all this is done by the Mighty▪ Power of GOD; as the same Apostle teaches, Eph. 2. 10. <HI>We are his Work∣manship, created in CHRIST JESUS to good Works.</HI> Thus deep must we make the Incision,—open the Wound to the Bottom,—shew them the Plague of the Heart and Nature, that they may <HI>feel</HI> themselves undone.—Sick unto Death. Then will CHRIST JESUS be precious to their Souls, when we preach his Unsearchable Riches and display the Fulness of his Grace. [This is the gospel Method of healing diseased Souls.—These the foundation Principles, upon which alone we may hope to effect a thorough, lasting Reformation. For the <HI>Tree</HI> must be <HI>made good,</HI> or it <HI>cannot bring forth good Fruit,</HI> as our Saviour teaches. If a <HI>clean Heart</HI> be not <HI>Created</HI> in Men, their Unmortified Lusts will have Vent; break out &amp; corrupt all their Doing.] In Vain do we attempt to perswade Men to Ho∣liness of Life, and press them to Obey the Com∣mandments of GOD, without leading of them to the Rock that is higher than they; to CHRIST JESUS for Strength.—To little Purpose do we arm our selves with strong Reasons or sum∣mon all the Force of Rhetorick, in declaiming against the Vices of the times, without plunging
<PB N="59" REF="008598_0058_102F953A2D9F7D38"/>
the Sword of Truth into the Sinners Heart, and Opening to him the Fountain of Corruption that lies within. <HI>This</HI> ought we to do, and not to leave the <HI>other</HI> undone.—One might as well expect to subdue the Shrubs only under Plain, only by nipping off the Buds in the Spring, as to heal a vicious People of their mortal Diseases, by working perpetually upon their immoral Practices <HI>alone,</HI> without opening the Nature, &amp; pressing the Necessity of the New Birth, or an inward Work of the Spirit of Grace.—Or if we grant that Sinners may be perswaded into an external Reformation, merely by the Force of Argument &amp; Intreaty, without an inward Cru∣cifixion of the <HI>Old Man;</HI> as possibly they might, for a while: yet this would be but <HI>to heal the Hurt of the Daughter of God's People slightly,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. 6. 14.</NOTE> there would be no room to cry <HI>Peace, Peace,</HI> for <HI>that.</HI> To cleanse the outside, while the Heart within remains diseased, full of Putrifying Sores, is to bestow much Labour &amp; Cost to little Pur∣pose: even like the Applying of costly Plaisters to Pimples in the Skin, when the whole Mass of Blood is corrupted. Let <HI>that</HI> be purged, and these Eruptions will die away.—How happy would it be, my Brethren, if all that preach the Gospel of CHRIST every where, (or that pro∣fess to do it,) <HI>did Speak the some thing and were perfectly joined together in the same Mind and in the same Judgment,</HI> respecting those Things?—
<PB N="60" REF="008598_0059_102F953BC69F2120"/>
Sinners, of Every Class, could then find no Place for Shelter nor Ease:—go where they would, they'd meet the pointed Arrows of GOD's Word, pricking of them in the Heart, &amp; could find no Rest for their Souls, until they found it in CHRIST: Which is the great Design of the Gospel Ministry.—Once more,</P>
<P>[2<HI>ly</HI> As ever we would Heal our diseased People, we must <HI>Practice</HI> as well as Preach the Gospel of CHRIST. <HI>Take Heed to ourselves that we breath nothing but the Spirit of the Gos∣pel, in the whole of our Conversation.</HI>—We should always remember that we are the Minis∣ters of the Meek and lowly JESUS▪ Upon whom the Holy Spirit descended like a Dove: in Consequence of which, <HI>when he was reviled He reviled not again.</HI> He bore the greatest In∣dignities with the utmost Patience, and mana∣ged all his Disputes, against the worst of Men, without any heat of Temper, or indecent Reflections. <HI>His Gentleness made him great.</HI>—Now, if we are his true Ministers, we have drunk a Measure of the same Spirit,—are for∣med into the same Temper and have learned to talk in his Language. And, with this Armour on, we need not fear. Such a mild and gentle Spirit is the best Defence against the rough and boisterous Sons of Violence. They cannot pierce this Coat of Mail,—this Clothing of Hu∣mility, if we keep it close about us; no, not with their most in venom'd Arrows. Therefore
<PB N="61" REF="008598_0060_102F9541FA535DB0"/>
did CHRIST JESUS expressly charge his Dis∣ciples, when he sent them forth, <HI>to be wise as Serpents and harmless as Doves.</HI> Take with you the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the Serpent, but leave his <HI>Poison</HI> and his <HI>Sting.</HI> Instead of <HI>that,</HI> take the <HI>Inno∣cence</HI> and <HI>Sweetness</HI> of the <HI>Dove,</HI> which has no Gall,—no Bitterness to Vent against her Ag∣gressors. This truly great and noble Spirit, tho' despicable in the Eyes of the World, will make us as bold as Lions in our Masters Cause: And, at the same time, enable us, the most ef∣fectually, to heal the Wounds, with which the Daughter of Zion is now bleeding to Death.—How entirely out of Character, then, do we the Ministers of CHRIST behave, when Our Con∣versation, Preaching, or Writings, are animated with an untender Spirit, and indecorated with hard Expressions or unkind Reflections. Surely, <HI>we do then walk naked, and they see our shame▪</HI> Too much of this has appeared, in some of our late Pamphlets: which, had it not been for the Author's Names, could hardly have been charg'd upon such worthy Ministers of our Meek and gentle Lord.—I meddle not with the <HI>Disputes</HI> themselves,—'tis enough for me to lament them!—But the <HI>Spirit</HI> with which some of them have been managed, is evidently so un∣like to CHRIST's Spirit;—so destitute of Love &amp; Gentleness: Yea, so full of Harshness and Severity, that I am perswaded Religion has been more wounded thereby, than it could
<PB N="62" REF="008598_0061_102F7463B2487F60"/>
have been by the <HI>Faults</HI> or <HI>unhappy things them∣selves</HI> that occasion'd those Disputes. And this, I hope will justify me in attempting to heal my Brethren of this Infirmity; that the Cause of CHRIST may suffer no more, for want of his kind and generous Spirit in defending of it.—As Moses said to Aaron, his Brother, in the Af∣fair of the Calf; <HI>What did this People unto Thee, that thou hast brought so great a Sin upon them?</HI> So let me be indulg'd the Question, Dear Bre∣thren, What have any done to provoke you, thus to Strip yourselves of your Priestly Gar∣ments, &amp; cloth yourselves in so rough a Dress,—a Founder's Habit.—Have any invaded the Rights of Conscience, or the Liberty of Churches and Societies? What then? Must we take up carnal Weapons to defend the sacred Cause? Is not the Sword of the Spirit our best Defence? Solid Arguments and Scriptures, well adapted, are like a Munition of Rocks.</P>
<P>IF any have laid aside the Gentleman and the Christian; and Abused the Public with Raillery instead of Reason; Let us remember and imi∣tate the Angel when he was disputing with Satan: <HI>He dare not bring a railing Accusation.</HI>—Had this been lawful; yet he forbore. He knew with whom he had to do.—If any have utter'd Falsehoods.—Let us shew them their Error, in a friendly manner; with Politeness of Speech: and make them ashamed. In a word; if any have done wrong; yea grievously stepp'd a∣side,—
<PB N="63" REF="008598_0062_102F9546A3C7F920"/>
It certainly becomes us to put on Chari∣ty, where there is any Room for it, &amp; suppose it was an Error of Judgment, in our Brethren, to which we are all liable: and then, how easy, yea how pleasant a thing is it, for us, with all Kindness and Gentleness of Spirit, to shew them their Mistake,—to set them in the right way, as one would a Weary Traveller, that has un∣happily miss'd his Road?</P>
<P>ON the Who (My dearly beloved Brethren; let us remember our Station in the Church of GOD▪ We are set in public View, for <HI>Exam∣ples to the Believers, in Word, in Conversation, in Churity, in</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>in Faith, in Purity.</HI> And as <HI>such,</HI> let us earnestly endeavour to re∣cover the Peace of Jerusalem,—healing the Breaches that are mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in her Walls. Whoever has unhappily or wickedly kindled the Fire. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> threatens the Devastation of our Spiritual Buildings and Civil Community, let not the Ministers of JESUS run up &amp; blow the Coals: but, on the contrary, exert our selves, with Di∣ligence and Zeal, to extinguish the Flames. This may hopefully be done, by the well plac'd Engines of Prudence, Moderation, Meekness, Love Unfeigned or fervent Charity, and for∣giving one Another.</P>
<P>LET me therefore <HI>beseech you,</HI> my good Bre∣thren, <HI>by he Meekness &amp; Gentleness of CHRIST,</HI> to put on <HI>as Men of GOD,</HI> that rich &amp; glorious Furniture, which Paul recommended to Timo∣thy,

<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 5. 11, 12.</NOTE> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Righteousness, Godliness, Faith, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, Patience, Meekness▪</HI>—that with this Armour of Light, we may <HI>so fight the good Fight of Faith, as to lay hold on eternal Life.</HI>].</P>
<P>VII. ult. <HI>I would close the Discourse with a word of Exhortation to the whole Audience.</HI></P>
<P>I beseech you all, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Bowels of our Com∣passionate Lord, who shed his most precious Blood, for the healing of all Nations, that you would each one, in your respective Stations, immediately do something, at the important work of <HI>Reforming</HI> what is amiss, both in your selves and others: that the whole Land, may, if possible, be heal'd at one▪ and as 'twere a Na∣tion born in a Day.</P>
<P>GOD has been justly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngry with us, and has smitten us for our Sins. But for all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has done, because we are unreformed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Anger is not turned away from us, but his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is stretched out still.</HI> He waits the Event of this Day:—this Season of Grace: yea waits to be gracious. And is ready to be pacify'd towards us. Only <HI>confess your Sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD and forsake them:</HI> repairing to the Fountain o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Grace for Pardon and Cleansing: and you shall find, <HI>that tho' he has wounded he will heal you, though he has smitten he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you up.</HI> Be∣lieve it; there is not one Soul of us all, but what is wounded with Sin. or has some Disease that
<PB N="65" REF="008598_0064_102F954E004BC670"/>
is threatning. If any are <HI>pure in their own Eyes,</HI> 'tis a Sign <HI>that they are not washed from their Filthiness.</HI> GOD's own Children have such Remains of Sin and Death upon them, and so much Filth about them, that they had need to cry with David, <HI>purge me with Hyssop, and I shall be clean, wash me and I shall be whiter than Snow.</HI> And Christless Sinners have all the Guilt and Filth upon them, which they brought into the World with them, and all that they have since contracted: and so are actually dying of their Diseases: Yea the Pangs of Eternal Death are ready to seize them.</P>
<P>BUT let your Maladies of Soul be what they will,—never so many,—never so ag∣gravated,—Old, Stubborn, uncommon and distressing, there's Help for <HI>you</HI> in JESUS CHRIST, the great Physician: His Balm, his Blood, apply'd by Faith, will heal you all. He is a Physician of a Thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ There's none like <HI>Him.</HI> He Undertakes for All that come. Bids them Welcome,—treats them with the Utmost Tenderness and Heals them effectually. None ever dyed in his Hands. And all this freely.—with∣out Money without Price.</P>
<P>AND finally, He this day invites you all to come and be healed. Isa. 1. 18. <HI>Come now and let us reason together saith the LORD;</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="008598_0065_102F954F8E14D008"/>
<HI>though your Sins he as Scarlet, They shall be as white as Snow: though they be red like Crimson they shall be as Wool.</HI></P>
