<P>WHO ever rightly Con∣siders the state of man∣kind since the Apostasy, the Universal depravity &amp; Corruption of humane Nature occasion'd thereby; the Disorders, Disquiets and Confusions which arise there∣from; will readily grant the necessity not only of Government in the world and of Persons of Eminency and every way fitted for the management of it; but also and espe∣cially of the Concurrence of the Spirit and Blessing of the Most High GOD, whose Thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is established in the Heavens and whose Kingdom ruleth over all Creatures, to inspire such with needful Qualifications, and to give Success to their Measures for the suppressing Disorder, and the restoration &amp;

preservation of Peace and Quietness among men: for which all Christians ought to Pray earnestly unto God; which is the Duty the Apostle exhorts to in our Text.</P>
<P>The Exhortation is, 1. <HI>General,</HI> Express'd in the preceding Verse; <HI>I exhort therefore, that first of all, Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, &amp; giving of Thanks be made for all men:</HI> Prayer is the Duty here Exhorted to; and I con∣ceive the Variety of Phrases by which the Apostle expresses it, is not Needless or Su∣perfluous, but that it has its Significancy, and intimates to us at least the Necessity and Importance of the Duty; and the Fervency wherewith it is to be performed: The A∣postle adds giving of Thanks, which though it be not Essential to Prayer, yet by Divine Order it is to be inserted into all our Prayers: <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. 6. <HI>But in every thing by Prayer and Sup∣plication with Thanksgiving, let your Requests be made known unto God:</HI> And indeed it is high∣ly Reasonable seeing God continually Ad∣ministers to us Matter and Occasions of Thanksgiving; and as we ought to Pray for Mercy for all Men, which is the first Branch of the Exhortation (except it be for such as are Guilty of the Sin, for which the Apostle would not say that Christians ought to Pray, which Exception is to be understood in the Apostles Exhortation) so we ought in our
<PB N="3" REF="001955_0004_0FBA419541AD90C0"/>
Prayers for them to offer Thanksgiving to God on their behalf, for the Bounties and Blessings He is continually bestowing upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Particular,</HI> As in the Text; where we may observe two things.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Persons we are Exhorted to Pray for, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>For Kings, &amp; for all in Authority;</HI> or all that are in Eminent Place, as it might have been rendered: Which intends those that have Supreme Authority &amp; all that are Commissionated by them, and Govern under them; thus the Apostle Phraseth it under another Head, 1<HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 13, 14. <HI>Whether it be to the King, as Supreme; Or unto Governours, as unto those that are sent by him.</HI> Which in∣tends the Supreme and all Inferiour Ma∣gistrates; which in those times were Hea∣thens, Discountenancers of and Enemies to the Christian Religion; nevertheless it was the will of the Inspired Apostle not only that their Authority should be Subjected to; but also that they should be Prayed for in all Christian Congregations.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The reason of it; <HI>That we may lead a Quiet and Peaceable Life in all Godliness and Honesty:</HI> There is a Threefold Peace; Peace with God; In our own Consciences; And with Men or in Societies, It is this latter that is particularly meant in the words; and I
<PB N="4" REF="001955_0005_0FBA4196A21737F8"/>
take the other Term, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Quiet,</HI> to be Syno∣nimous and to mean the same thing: and these are absolutely Necessary to the comfort of Life: for though we have a Confluence of all other good things yet if we have not Peace &amp; Quietness in the Fruition of them; we shall want much of their Comfort, and their Sweetness will be very much di∣minished: the Apostle adds, <HI>In all Godliness and Honesty,</HI> which seems to Limit Peace and Quietness to things Sacred, as to the Wor∣ship of God and the Exercise of Religion which are intended in these Phrases, 9. <HI>d.</HI> That we may Worship God according to the mind of Christ in the Gospel, and Practice the other Duties of Religion without Mo∣lestation, which they often met with from their Heathen Rulers and from the Jews by their allowance; and doubtless the Apostle had a particular aim at this and desired it above all other things: But yet we may sup∣pose that the general meaning of the Apostle in this expression was, that they might not be Disturbed or Disquieted in any of their Injoyments, and in this Latitude I shall take the words.</P>
<P>The Matter of our Prayers for Kings, and those in Authority is not to be Limited by this clause in the Text, for then we should Pray for our selves rather than for them, but
<PB N="5" REF="001955_0006_0FBA41988EB5E650"/>
our Prayers for them ought to be Directed by their Circumstances and Conditions: The Apostle is silent as to the Petitions which they were to offer unto God for their Rulers; but we may conclude, that, they being Hea∣thens and Enemies to the Christian Religion, one main &amp; principal thing which they were to Petition for, was, that they might be Con∣verted to the Christian Faith, and be made Defenders, Countenancers and Incouragers of their Religion: but we living under a Christi∣an Government, and being under Christian Rulers, our Prayers for them must be Varied accordingly: but more may be said of this afterwards.</P>
<P>The Text is Copious and affords Instructi∣ons to all Orders and Degrees of Men.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> are here Instructed in one great End and Design of Government, which is the Peace and Quietness of those over whom they Rule, and also in their Work and Duty; which is the Procurement &amp; Mainte∣nance of their Peace &amp; Quietness, that they may lead a Peaceable and Quiet Life under their Government, this is Plainly Suggested in the Text.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Ruled</HI> are here Instructed in their Duty, particularly and expresly in the great Duty of Prayer to God for their Rulers, that they may be furnished to their Work, and be
<PB N="6" REF="001955_0007_0FBA419A2C559818"/>
made Instrumental in bringing about this great end &amp; design of Government the Peace &amp; Quietness of those over whom they Rule: These are the two Heads which by Divine Assistance, I shall speak to at this Time.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Peace and Quietness among Men and in Societies, is one end and design of Civil Government, and it is the Work and Duty of all that are In∣vested with Civil Power and Authority to en∣deavour that all that Live under their Government may have Peace and Quietness in all their Injoy∣ments.</HI> This is so Plain and Evident that I need not inlarge upon the Proof of it: two things are included in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Peace and Quietness among Men and in Societies is one end and design of Government:</HI> And one of the Principal ends and designs of it next unto the Glory of God, which is the ultimate End and Design of all things. The Supreme Lord hath Ordained Govern∣ment and given Kings and Rulers their Of∣fices and their Dignity for this end; that they being Armed with Power and Authori∣ty they may Preserve Publick Peace and Or∣der in the World: and herein it is that they are Ministers of God for our good.</P>
<P>For the Proof of this I shall only Instance in some of the main parts of Government, and shew that this is their Principal design,
<PB N="7" REF="001955_0008_0FBA419C372318D8"/>
which will sufficiently Evince that it is one main end and design of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) This is the design of all Humane Laws which contain the Rules of Government, and it ought to be in the Intention of those that have the Power of making them, and also of them that are appointed for the Execution of them; they are for the Protection of the Subjects in a Quiet and Peaceable Possession of all that God and Nature hath Bestowed upon them; and they ought to be framed accordingly and so Executed: That this end may be attained; that every man may sit Quietly under his Vine &amp; be undisturbed in their Injoyments of what kind so ever they be.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) This is the end and design of all Ad∣ministrations of Justice in Civil Courts: they are appointed for the Decision of Controver∣sies among Men: The true Ground or Foundation of Differences and Contentions among Men: or Wrong done either real or supposed and imaginary: now Civil Courts are appointed to Inquire into all Wrongs and Injuries, and to give Judgment according as they appear, which is to Determine and Issue the Controversies that arise there from: So that Peace and Quietness is the end and de∣sign of the Administration of Justice in Civil Courts.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="001955_0009_0FBA419E206234F8"/>
(3.) This is the Design and Intention of many of the Offices that are Conferred in Government; which may be Termed Offices or Commissions of the Peace: which Offices do particularly oblige those that sustain them to take care of the Peace &amp; to Improve their Power and Authority, for the Defence and Preservation of it: and unto such, Persons are Directed to go for Relief when Unjustly Molested and Injured: these things Argue that this is one of the main ends and designs of Government. And we are not to think this too <HI>mean</HI> to be the design of so Honoura∣ble a Calling and Imployment: for Peace and Quietness or Undisturbed Injoyment of our Blessings whether Spiritual or Temporal, is the very Life of our Injoyments, and the want of it renders every thing Uncomfortable and Unpleasant: it is more Eligible to want many other Blessings than that of Peace and Quietness: <HI>Prov.</HI> 17. 1. <HI>Better is a dry Morsel, and Quietness therewith, than a House full of Sa∣crifices with Strife.</HI></P>
<P>But I Proceed:</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is therefore the Work and Duty of all that are Invested with Civil Power &amp; Authority to en∣deavour after the Attainment of this good and great end of Government:</HI> And all that are Im∣ployed in Government, ought to make such an Improvement of their Authority in their
<PB N="9" REF="001955_0010_0FBA419F4BF829C8"/>
respective Posts, as that those that are under their Government may lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life: this necessarily follows, for surely if this be one end of Government, then those that are Imployed in Government ought to look at this and to endeavour after it: But this is evident to all and I need not offer any further Proof of it. I proceed to
The APPLICATION of this Head.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hence whatsoever in any Government whe∣ther it be Person, Office or Law, or any other thing, that crosses &amp; obstructs this design of Government, it is &amp; must be accounted an Evil, and ought to be Suppressed.</HI> The Law accounts them such, styling them common Nusances; and such there are in every Government; and doubt∣less were Strict Inquisition made, there might be many such things found in this Go∣vernment, which have hither unto Obstruct∣ed our Peace and Quietness, and Frustrated the Attempts that have been made for the Procurement thereof: and so long as such things are allowed and connived at Peace can't be expected.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence Peaceable men, being otherways Qualified, are the most fit for Office in Go∣vernment.</HI> Men of Peaceable and Quiet Tempers and Spirits; Men that are Zealous
<PB N="10" REF="001955_0011_0FBA41A0AD58BFD8"/>
for Peace; &amp; are willing to forego their own Interest, for the Peace and Tranquility of the whole: these are the men fit for Offices in Government; for these are the most likely to attain this end of Government and to Procure and Maintain the Peace and Quiet∣ness of the People: and this may serve for a Direction unto those who have the Privilege of designing Persons for Offices, and have Power of Conferring Offices upon Persons in this Government; this ought to be Re∣garded especially at this time, when Divi∣sions and Animosities abound in the Govern∣ment.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>And Lastly,</HI> I shall Conclude with a word of <HI>Exhortation</HI> unto those that are or are to be our Rulers for the Ensuing Year; <HI>There are many things which Disturb our Peace; and because of our Divisions there are great thoughts of Heart.</HI> It is fitting, <HI>Honourable, Worshipful, and Highly Esteemed,</HI> that under this Head I should make my Humble Address unto you particularly, for the Healing of our Dif∣ferences and the Recovery of our Peace and Quietness: The Address has been already made by a better Hand upon the last occasi∣on of this Nature: but in as much as our Di∣visions and Animosities still remain, and I fear Increase. I must beg leave to Re-assume the Exhortation; and in Meekness and with
<PB N="11" REF="001955_0012_0FBA41A260F97B88"/>
all due Respect I Intreat that you still use your utmost endeavours that our <HI>Jerusalem may be Built a City Compact,</HI> and that it may be <HI>a Quiet and Peaceable Habitation:</HI> This is pe∣culiarly your Province, and our Eyes are upon you under God for it. It is the Expectation of God whom you Represent, and Serve; and of the People over whom you Rule; that you exert all your Power, and Improve all your Wisdom and Dexterity, your Policy and Prudence for to Reduce us to good Order; that we may be favoured with the Invaluable Blessing of Peace and Quietness in all our Enjoyments Sacred &amp; Civil. Herein you will Act like Him whom you Represent, who has stiled Himself <HI>the God of Peace;</HI> and is so not only as He is the Author of Peace, but also as He Loves &amp; Delights in it; and as He has bestowed His Honourable Name &amp; Character upon you; so it becomes you to Answer it in your Respective Places and ac∣cording to the Talents Committed to your Trust. And in so doing you will Answer one main end of your Offices, keep a good Conscience, and Inherit the Blessing our Lord has Intailed upon Peace Makers, mentioned in <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 9.</P>
<P>As to our Churches and the Exercise of our Religion; we have reason to Bow down and to Adore God for the Liberty and Free∣dom
<PB N="12" REF="001955_0013_0FBA41A717D24C10"/>
the Peace &amp; Quietness we are Indulged with, and in that our Rulers are Christians; Countenancers and Incouragers of Religion; and have made good Laws for the Preservati∣on of our Peace in the Worship of God; and in that the ways to our Solemn Assemblies don't Mourn: But yet we have reason to be Humbled that there has been so many Di∣visions in some of our Churches to the great Detriment of Religion and Hindrance to the Work of God in them; and if there might be something farther done for the Prevent∣ing of Feuds and Schisms in our Churches, it would be very Acceptable unto God and Serviceable to the Interest of Christ. I shall not undertake to Determine the Extent of the Civil Magistrates Power in Matters Ec∣clesiastical: it is Evident that there is a care Incumbent upon Civil Rulers of Churches and of Church Matters, and in many Cases they ought to Exert their Authority: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. e.</HI> particularly in matters of Order where there are no particular Rules in the Word of God to Oblige the Consciences of Men to the con∣trary; and in things that are left to the Judgment, Prudence and Conduct of Church Officers and Churches. I conceive that the Rules drawn up and agreed upon by them, whether they be for the more Regular and Decent Worshipping of God or the Exercise
<PB N="13" REF="001955_0014_0FBA41AA9A596068"/>
of Discipline, ought to be Established by the Civil Magistrates Authority, and their Sanction ought to be Binding to all; for in such things all ought to Acquiesce in the Judgment of the Churches; and those who Refuse ought to be Compelled, which would very much Conduce to Peace and Quietness in our Churches; which would very much Advantage Religion in them.</P>
<P>But as to our Civil Affairs; I Presume that if Property was setled upon a better Founda∣tion, it would Contribute much to our Peace and Quietness: for many of our Differences, especially in our <HI>New Towns,</HI> arise from the Various Sentiments, and Different Opinions there are about it: and it Creates many Uncomfortable Law-Suits, which Excites the Passions of men, begets Prejudices in them, and Ingenders Striles and Conten∣tions, which brings with them <HI>Confusion and every Evil Work.</HI> Hereby our Peace is very much Disturbed and Religion is very much Hurt.</P>
<P>I speak Feelingly, for Divine Providence has cast my Habitation in the very midst of them; not that I am Personally Injured or Molested; but my meaning is, that I Feel the Hurt that our Contentions does Religi∣on and the Interest of Men: and I should exceedingly Rejoyce could there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e found a
<PB N="14" REF="001955_0015_0FBA41AC1B57F060"/>
Remedy to prevent those intolerable Moles∣tations which some men meet with, and the Litigious and Vexatious Law Suits that are Commenced and Carried on to the great Disturbance of our Peace.</P>
<P>And if there might be a Closer Applicati∣on made of the Laws of the Colony to the Troublers of our <HI>Israel,</HI> it might be very Sub∣servient to our Peace and Quietness: there are <HI>Achans</HI> among us, who by their Trans∣gressions Molest us, <HI>Provoke God</HI> and bring down His heavy Judgments upon us <HI>to our Trouble and Confusion:</HI> these Frequently escape due Punishment, whereby they are Embold∣ened in their Transgressions and proceed even to offer Contempt to our Authority and Laws; there are some of our Laws which in some Places are but rarely if ever put in Ex∣ecution: the end of the Law which is the Peace and Safety of the Subject can't be At∣tained unless it be put in Execution.</P>
<P>And therefore if there might be great care taken in the Designation of Persons for the Execution of the Laws of the Government; and if such Persons might be found in every Town, and Impowered for this Service, who are Conscientious, Men of Courage, Zeal and Resolution; who are Sensible of the Solemn Nature and Obligation of an Oath and Fear it; and had rather Hazard all, than Offend
<PB N="15" REF="001955_0016_0FBA41AD5FC312B0"/>
GOD or Wrong their own Consciences, or be Unfaithful in their Places and Stations: it would with the Blessing of God Accom∣panying their endeavours, exceedingly Con∣duce to our Peace and Quietness.</P>
<P>And if more Care might be taken of our <HI>New Towns,</HI> it might be very Serviceable to them in their Beginning, and prevent their falling into Contentions.</P>
<P>But to draw to a Close: Let Justice have free Course in the Government, and let Schools of Learning be Incouraged and Pro∣moted; this is an Excellent means to Culti∣vate the rough Tempers of those that are growing up, and to inure them to Civility &amp; good Order; which will contribute to our future Peace and Quietness.</P>
<P>And above all things let Religion be Pro∣moted, and endeavour that Godliness may be in the midst of us in the Power of it, and that your Peoples Hearts may be seasoned with the Fear of God and be Established with the Peaceable Principles of Religion.</P>
<P>And for this end, Comfort and Incourage the Embassadours of Peace, who are Devoted to this Work; I Hope none of us are wanting in our Places, either to forward this work or to be helpful unto you in your endeavours for the Peace and Welfare of this People; by our Prayers, Counsels and Instructions;
<PB N="16" REF="001955_0017_0FBA41AEE3812068"/>
putting the People in mind to be Subject &amp; Obedient to your Laws &amp; Ordinances.</P>
<P>And finally, Let me commend to you U∣nion among your selves, as that which will exceedingly strengthen your Authority, and forward your endeavours &amp; attempts for the attaining of our Peace and Quietness. En∣deavour then to be of one Mind, and at Peace among your selves. I pass on to</P>
<P>II. <HI>It is the Duty of Christians to Pray for those that have the Rule over them, that they may be Enabled so to manage Government, as that Publick Peace and Quietness may be Preserved.</HI> And under this Head, I shall 1. Shew that it is a Duty: And 2. What we are to Pray for in order hereunto.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may Argue this Duty from sundry Heads, As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) From the <HI>Divine Original of Civil Go∣vernment.</HI> It is not an Ordinance of Man, but of God's. <HI>The Powers that be, are of God; whosoever therefore resisteth</HI> them, <HI>resisteth</HI> an <HI>Ordinance of God, Rom.</HI> 13. 1, 2. The Original of Government is in God; particular Forms or Modes of Government are of Mans In∣venting; but the Substance of it came from God, and therefore it Depends upon Him for Support and Success: Government can't be Maintained in the World without God who
<PB N="17" REF="001955_0018_0FBA41B05D35EF90"/>
gave it its being; for the First Cause of a thing is necessary to its Subsistance; neither can there be any good Success of Govern∣ment, or any of its good Ends attained un∣less its Author Smiles upon it, and His Bles∣sing go with it; therefore we ought to Pray to God for those that are Designed and Impowred for the Management of Go∣vernment.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) From the <HI>Station and Capacity in which Civil Rulers stand in Government.</HI> The High∣est in Authority upon Earth are under God. He is the Supreme, and his Power is Un∣limited, and he does whatsoever he Pleases and gives no Account of his Matters. Men are but Instruments in his Hands, and their Offices are only Ministerial; hence called <HI>Ministers of God, Rom.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 4. Now Instru∣ments depend upon their Efficient Cause for Power to Act in their Places and in the Work they are Imployed about. Men have no Power to Act in Government but what they Receive from God. <HI>Joh.</HI> 19. 11. <HI>Jesus Answered, Thou couldest have no Power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.</HI> It is by Influence &amp; Direction and Assistance from above that Kings Reign, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 15, 16. <HI>By me Kings Reign, and Princes Decree Justice. By me Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth:</HI> They Rule their King∣doms
<PB N="18" REF="001955_0019_0FBA41B1E1EE5B08"/>
wisely, justly &amp; happily, by My Coun∣sel and Assistance. Therefore we ought to Pray to God for them.</P>
<P N="3">(3) From the <HI>Absolute Power and Dominion which God has over the hearts of all men.</HI> They are intirely in his Hands; even the hearts of the highest and greatest upon Earth are at his Command; <HI>Prov.</HI> 21. 1. <HI>The kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: He turneth it whithersoever he will.</HI> He in∣fluences and over-rules the very Inward Pur∣poses, Inclinations and Counsels of their Hearts, which seem to be most in their own Power and out of the way of all others: God can give unto Rulers the Spirit of Govern∣ment, as he gave unto <HI>Saul</HI> another Heart, a Spirit of &amp; Qualification for Government, when He Designed and Appointed him for to Rule his People <HI>Israel;</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10. 9. Therefore God is to be sought to for those that Rule over us.</P>
<P N="4">(4) From the <HI>Necessity of Government, and of Persons very well Accomplished for to manage it.</HI> Were it not for Government, the World would soon run into all manner of disorders and confusions: mens Lives and Estates and Liberties would soon be a prey to the Co∣vetous and the Cruel; and we can't express the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice and Murder, the Rapine and Rob∣beries, the Mischiefs and Miseries which
<PB N="19" REF="001955_0020_0FBA41B35663CBD8"/>
would abound in the World were there no Government to Restrain men: One man would be Bread for another, and the World which is like the Sea for Storms &amp; Tempests, would also Resemble it in this, that the In∣habitants thereof would be as the Fishes of the Sea, the great would Devour the small; <HI>Hab.</HI> 1. 14. <HI>As the Fishes of the Sea, who have no Rule over them.</HI> We may plainly see the Necessity of Government in the World, in the Instance of some, who have thrown off the Reins of Government; &amp; what Uprores have they made? What Outrages and Depre∣dations have they Committed? taking away the Lives and Estates of men at their Plea∣sure: and merely for the gratification of their Cursed Lusts; and what the issue of this tragical design will be, God only knows! This is a convincing Argument of the Ne∣cessity of Government. There is also a Ne∣cessity of well Accomplished Persons for the Management of it: The Weight of Govern∣ment is too great to be laid upon the Shoul∣der of mean men; it is Rulers of the Earth, that under God, uphold it: They are there∣fore called, <HI>the Pillars of the Earth, Psal.</HI> 73. 3. This argues, that it is a Duty to Pray for <HI>Civil Rulers.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5) From the <HI>Difficulties which Attend Go∣vernment,</HI> which arise principally from the
<PB N="20" REF="001955_0021_0FBA41B4D4E73DF8"/>
restless Passions and ungoverned Spirits and Lusts of men: These are the prime occasion of all those Divisions and Clamours that are in the world; <HI>Jam.</HI> 4. 1: <HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings? Come they not hence, even of your Lusts, that War in your Members?</HI> This renders the Work of those in Government very Difficult; yea Impossible for them of themselves to Quiet and Still the Tumults that are in the world: and to Suppress the Disorders that Sin and the Lusts of men bring into the world. Hence it is in Scrip∣ture Ascribed to Him that has Power to Command the raging Sea and to still the noise of its Waves, <HI>Psal.</HI> 65. 7. <HI>Which stilleth the noise of their Waves, and the Tumult of the People.</HI> This argues that we ought to Pray to God for our Rulers.</P>
<P N="2">2. To shew what we are to Pray for; or what is to be the Matter of our Prayers for our Rulers. This I shall dispatch in these following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>We are to Pray for their Welfare, Spiritu∣al and Temporal:</HI> That they may have all saving Grace and everlasting Glory. For their Lives, and all those Blessings which are necessary to their Comfort &amp; Support; and for their Encouragement, that they may be in a Capacity to undergo and grapple with the Fatigues of Government: and to live

answerable to the Dignity of their Place and Station in the world; as they are Distin∣guished from &amp; exalted above others by the Honour and Dignity that is Conferred upon them, so they ought to be in their living: and as their work and service is arduous and difficult, so they ought to be Supported and Encouraged. Which we are to Pray for.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>We are to Pray for all good Qualifications for Government;</HI> as a right Heart and Spirit to rule over others, Knowlege and Wis∣dom, Courage and Fortitude, Patience and the Fear of God, a sincere &amp; disinterested aim at the Glory of God, &amp; the Peace, &amp; Order, and Beauty of the world: Strength &amp; Zeal, and Resolution for the vigorous Prosecution of these ends: These are the gifts of God, &amp; are absolutely necessary for Government: We are therefore to look to God for them: &amp; particularly &amp; especially the Prayer which <HI>Solomon</HI> offered unto God for himself, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 3. 9. is very suitable for us to offer unto God for our Rulers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That God would give them an understanding Heart, to Judge his People, that they may discern between good and evil.</HI> And also that Prayer which he offered unto God, in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 1. 10. <HI>Give me now Wisdom and Knowlege, that I may go out and come in before this People.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="22" REF="001955_0023_0FBA41BD4AC500F8"/>
(3) <HI>For the Presence of God with them, the influences of his Spirit &amp; Grace to assist and di∣rect them, and his Blessing upon their Counsels, Designs and Undertakings, for the attainment of our Peace, that it may flow in as a River.</HI></P>
<P>APPLICATION.</P>
<P N="1">1. Two sorts of Persons are to be Re∣proved.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>Those who instead of Praying for Civil Rulers, Revile 'em &amp; speak Contumeliously of them.</HI> This must needs be a very great evil, because it is directly contrary to Praying for them: which the Apostle in our Text exhorts to, &amp; we have shewed is a Christian duty: Which we find also strictly forbidden, in <HI>Exod.</HI> 22. 28. <HI>Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.</HI> Not gods falsly so called, as some wou'd have it, but Magistrates &amp; Governours, as is evident in the next clause, <HI>Nor Curse the Ruler of thy People.</HI> They are called gods, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 82. 6. <HI>I have said, Ye are gods,</HI>—It must needs therefore be a very great Sin to Revile them, &amp; to speak Evil of them, &amp; an affront unto God whose Deputies they are, under whom they Govern, and whose Name they bear, which renders it odious &amp; abominable. Hence the Apostle <HI>Jude</HI> animadverts upon it as such, and that very sharply; calling them
<PB N="23" REF="001955_0024_0FBA41C1E43B5078"/>
<HI>filthy Dreamers</HI> who <HI>despise Dominion, and speak evil of Dignities.</HI> And though <HI>Michael the Arch-Angel, when contending with the Devil, durst not bring a railing accusation against him, Jude</HI> 8, 9. Yet how many are there in these days who are hardy and impudent enough, to heap Reproaches and Contume∣lies on their Rulers, who utter their Reviling and scurrilous Speeches, more freely than they do their Prayers for their Rulers; and if they make any Prayers for them, their Practices contradict them, and render them ineffectual.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Those who hinder our Peace and Quietness, and promote Contentions, are also Reprehensible:</HI> For they act contrary to the duty we have been insisting on: and contradict the reason of the Apostles exhortation in our Text. It is the work of our Rulers to preserve Peace, and our Duty in the mean time to Pray for them, that they may be Assisted &amp; Directed, Counselled and Advised in this work from above. They that obstruct our Peace act directly contrary not only to their work, but to their own Duty; which must needs be a very great evil and very Offensive unto God. This is one of the <HI>Six things which the Lord hates,</HI> yea it is <HI>the Seventh which is an Abomina∣tion to him, Prov.</HI> 6. 19.—<HI>And him that sow∣eth Discord among Brethren</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="001955_0025_0FBA41C3319121F8"/>
2. From hence we may also Infer, <HI>the Duties of Reverence, Subjection and Obedience which we owe to our Civil Rulers.</HI> For if we ought to Pray for them, then surely we ought to shew them the Respect and Reve∣rence which the Word of God requires and their Station calls for: and also to Subject ourselves to their Authority, and Obey all their lawful Commands. We are also here taught that it is our Duty to afford them all that Encouragement, and all that Help we can in their Work: and particularly we ought in our respective places to concur with and to forward their designs and en∣deavours for our Peace and Quietness: And if every one would be ready to this, it would make their work very easie and de∣lightsom.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In the last Place,</HI> I shall Commend the Practice of the Duty we have been insisting on, 1. To those that are in the Ministry. And, 2. To all the People in general.</P>
<P N="1">[1] <HI>Let my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the Ministry, suffer the word of Exhortation to the per∣formance of this Duty.</HI> Unto those of our Order, &amp; unto us the Exhortation in the Text is <HI>particularly given;</HI> and it becomes us who ought <HI>to give our selves to Prayer,</HI> to be Earnest &amp; Importunate therein <HI>for all that are in Authority over us:</HI> That the Go∣vernment that is Committed to them may be ma∣naged so Wisely, Prudently and Faithfully, as that we and our People may lead a Quiet &amp; Peaceable
<PB N="25" REF="001955_0026_0FBA41C49634EBD8"/>
Life under it: This will very much Contribute to our Ease and Comfort; for all that are in the Ministry know by experience, that Divisions among their People is a very great Obstruction to their Work, and creates them a great deal of Trouble and Difficulty: This will also promote the <HI>Common Good,</HI> which we especially ought to look at &amp; endeavour after: it will prevent a great deal of Sin; <HI>for where there is Strife and Contention there is every Evil Work,</HI> and be a means to promote the Eternal Salvation and Happiness of Souls: which above all things is incumbent upon us to Promote.</P>
<P N="2">[2] <HI>Let all the People be Exhorted to the performance of the Duty of Prayer for their Rulers</HI> Prayer is a Duty incumbent on Private Christians, as well as those that are in Publick Posts and Serve at the Altar; and every Christian in his Place and Station, ought to have so much regard to their Rulers both in Church and State, and also to their own Peace and Quietness, and best Good, as to Pray to GOD earnestly and frequently for them, that they may be enabled to discharge their Duty, and to preserve Publick Peace and Order: in so doing you will Pray for the Peace of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which all are Obliged to; <HI>Psal.</HI> 122. 6. <HI>Pray for the Peace of Jerusa∣lem,</HI>—</P>
<P>But more Particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us all be Exhorted to Pray for our Sovereign King</HI> GEORGE, <HI>the happy and blessed Instrument of the Peace and Tranquility of Great Britain, and this Land:</HI> That the Almighty would still be with Him, Preserve and Lengthen out His Life, Prosper and Succeed His Government over us; and Crown Him with the best of Blessings: ever remembring to offer unto God in our Prayers, <HI>the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving and Praise,</HI> for the rich Blessings of Peace and Order which under GOD, and by his Influences He has been the Author of. And here I
<PB N="26" REF="001955_0027_0FBA41C64E4E71F0"/>
might be large in recounting and discanting upon the Signal &amp; Wonderful Providence of GOD, whereby He was brought to the <HI>British.</HI> Throne, at a juncture when both Religion and Civil Liberty were in imminent Danger; and Popery &amp; Ar∣bitrary Government ready to step in,—Whereby He has been made Successful &amp; eminently Instrumen∣tal in quieting their Troubles, &amp; healing the Divisi∣ons of our Nation; setting both Religion &amp; Govern∣ment upon a better Foundation. These things are most worthy of our <HI>Thanksgiving &amp; Praise.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>For all that are in Places of Authority there:</HI> That they may be well Spirited for the interest of Religion and the Liberties of the Nations: That they may be filled with Zeal and Fortitude, with Wisdom and good Understanding: that they may be fitted to act aright in their respective Posts: and to serve GOD according to his Will in their Generations: That GREAT BRITAIN may be Defended from all intestine and forein Enemies, and her Peace and Tranquility lengthened out.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>For all those that are or may be immediately over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Authority;</HI> The Honourable GOVER∣NOUR, the Lieutenant GOVERNOUR, the Worshipful ASSISTANTS, the whole AS∣SEMBLY, and for all in <HI>Inferior Posts,</HI> that the Presence of GOD may be with them: Especially with the Assembly in their <HI>Present Session,</HI> that they may be assisted and directed by Him: that they may have right apprehension of our Troubles and Difficulties, and afford us Relief: that there may be Union among them, and an Healing Spirit, that they may as one man seek the Peace and Welfare of this People. I Conclude with the words following the Text; <HI>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</HI></P>
