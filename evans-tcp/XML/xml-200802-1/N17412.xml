<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PROVERBS, CHAP. 8, VERSE 16.</BIBL>
<Q>BY ME PRINCES RULE, AND NOBLES, EVEN ALL THE JUDGES OF THE EARTH.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN compliance with the laudable example of our pious Ancestors, on such joyful anniversary occasions as this day presents us with—we have assembled in the House of GOD, to offer our de∣vout praises to him for what he has done for them, and for us, their children; to seek his direction and blessing upon our Political Fathers here pre∣sent, in the discharge of the important trust re∣posed in them, and his smiles on this confederat∣ed rising Republic.</P>
<P>AND as it has fallen to one of the least of the Ambassadors of CHRIST, to perform so essential a part of the exercise of the day, it will not be ex∣pected that he turn Statesman in this sacred place, or wander into all the affairs of government: But, in compliance with his character as a Mini∣ster, make such observations from the sacred text,
<PB N="6" REF="022506_0005_0FB947A36ACF51F0"/>
as may be profitable for direction and encourage∣ment, that the men of GOD here present, may be furnished to every good work.</P>
<P>THIS book was pen'd by King Solomon—a man famed for wisdom and understanding through∣out all the East.</P>
<P>THAT BEING who has an easy access to the human mind, appeared to him in Gibeon, in a vision of the night; and GOD said, ask what I shall give thee? And his request, "give therefore thy servant an understanding heart," was so ac∣ceptable, that GOD gave him wisdom above all that were before him in Jerusalem; for the peo∣ple soon perceived "that the wisdom of GOD was in him to do judgment."</P>
<P>IN these Proverbs of the wise man, we have the comprehensive duties we owe to GOD, and the world, made plain and easy, and enforced with the most powerful motives. By folly, the Preacher would be understood to mean vice and wicked∣ness—and by wisdom, grace and CHRIST.</P>
<P>IN the text, the person speaking is doubtless JESUS CHRIST, who by the Apostle, is called "the wisdom of GOD, and the power of GOD." "By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth:" That is, by my Providence
<PB N="7" REF="022506_0006_0FB947A4E0E55B30"/>
and appointment, they are advanced to rule and govern; and their government is merciful and righteous, happy and prosperous, by my council and assistance.</P>
<P>EVER since the apostacy, the blessed GOD, has pursued an uniform plan of grace, and govern∣ment with the church, and the world. The merciful design of which, is to reduce to order, peace and happiness, his intelligent offspring.—To prosecute this design, he has sent into the world the "PRINCE of PEACE," and given him a commission for acts of ministry and grace—magistracy and government.</P>
<P>THE intervention of the new covenant, and the advent of JESUS its Mediator, gave birth to order and subordination in Heaven, and upon Earth.</P>
<P>IN Heaven there are thrones, dominions, princi∣palities and powers, angels and arch-angels; and upon earth, princes, nobles, and judges—and CHRIST is Head over them all.</P>
<P>THE text leads us to speak of civil government, as ordained of GOD, in the hands of the Mediator; of civil rulers, as holding their commission and authority under CHRIST; of their duty and dig∣nity as his Ministers, and of the duty and privi∣lege of the people under their administration.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="022506_0007_0FB947A6C7202C48"/>
I. THAT civil government is ordained of GOD in the hands of the Mediator, the absolute neces∣sity of order and government, for the existence and happiness of society, pleads its divine origi∣nal: For without it; the affairs of mankind would fall into the utmost confusion and disorder.</P>
<P>THE nature of man, as a sociable creature, would no doubt, have led him to some sort of go∣vernment, had sin never entered the world. But since sin has debased the noble nature of man, and spread itself through the whole world—both reason and revelation plead for government.</P>
<P>IT is not a matter of human prudence only, but of necessity and moral obligation: And being enjoined by him who rules in the kingdoms of mortal men, it is an important mean of delivering us from the evils of the apostacy; and designed to prepare us for the more encouraging restraints the gospel enjoins.</P>
<P>CIVIL government, then, is a branch of the tree of life, and founded in, and built upon that covenant, sealed in Heaven by the oath of GOD, and upon earth by the blood of CHRIST.</P>
<P>HE being commissioned by the Father to manage the great affairs of Empire, as well as of Zion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="022506_0008_0FB947A7F3DB6BD0"/>
"YET have I set my King upon my holy Hill of Zion."—"The government shall be upon his shoulders."</P>
<P>THE kingdom of CHRIST, where he rules by his word and spirit, is his Church, a spiritual kingdom. But his commission extends to the utmost ends of the earth.</P>
<P>"FOR the stone cut out of the mountain with∣out hands, is to break in pieces all other king∣doms, and fill the earth."</P>
<P>HIS kingdom will outlive all other kingdoms, and swallow them up; for he must reign till he hath "put down all rule and all authority and power."</P>
<P>THIS implies that rule and authority among men, or which is the same thing, civil govern∣ment, is a divine appointment, and that it is put into the hands of the Mediator to rule and go∣vern the world. For when the great and impor∣tant ends for which he received his mediatorial kingdom, shall be accomplished▪ he will put down both ministry and magistracy.</P>
<P>II. THAT civil rulers hold their commis∣sion and authority under CHRIST.</P>
<P>NOT that CHRIST has pointed out the form of government, or the persons to rule and go∣vern;
<PB N="10" REF="022506_0009_0FB947A95DAC0220"/>
in this sense his "kingdom is not of this world." But christianity enforces the law of na∣ture; and has confirmed the several constitutions of states and kingdoms, and called our obedience to the higher powers, as the gospel finds them.</P>
<P>THE mode of government, and persons to go∣vern, are submitted to the wisdom of men, in pursuance of a divine ordinance, that second causes might operate. It being the method of GOD to carry on the designs of his government in this world, by the instrumentality of subordinate Agents. When therefore, a people unite in a form of government, and choose persons to rule and govern them, and pledge their faith to be obe∣dient to, and support the government, "though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth or addeth thereunto▪"</P>
<P>THE Magistrate then, called to office by the voice of the people, and solemnly sworn, becomes an ordinance of GOD, and receives his authority from him, "by whom Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth."</P>
<P>AND the Apostle, when he enjoins obedience to civil rulers, "because the powers that be, are or∣dained of GOD," means to include in his idea, the methods by which they become possessed of their power, and likewise the use and improvement
<PB N="11" REF="022506_0010_0FB947AAE78821E8"/>
they make of it: If they rule for GOD, and for good to the people, they are to be subjected to, otherwise, "we ought to obey GOD, rather than men."</P>
<P>III. WE come to speak of the duty and digni∣ty of civil rulers, as the ministers of CHRIST.</P>
<P>1st. IT is their duty to uphold the kingdom of CHRIST, which consists in "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the HOLY GHOST."</P>
<P>RELIGION is, and ever has been, considered the glory of a people; as it insures the favour and protection of Heaven.</P>
<P>UNDER the former dispensation, the Ark of GOD, which contained his laws, was a token of his presence and defence. Governour Eli, whose heart trembled for it, sustained the tidings of the of the death of his two Sons with fortitude; but when it was told him that the Ark of GOD was taken, he fell and died, and his Daughter refused to be comforted, though a Son was born; because the glory was departed from Israel, and the Ark of GOD was taken.</P>
<P>UNDER this dispensation, the gospel and its ordinances, are our glory and defence. And as magistrates are honoured by CHRIST, and act under his banner, they should be careful to be his glory, and support his religion in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="022506_0011_0FB947AE2F298068"/>
ALL men should be possessed of a principle of piety and virtue; but none stand in greater need of it than those who are called to rule and govern.</P>
<P>RELIGION dignifies and enobles the mind—refines and purifies the heart—fits men to act worthily their part on the stage of life, and shines with a peculiar lustre in the christian magistrate▪ This will procure for them honour in the sight of all men; "for those that honour m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I will honour."</P>
<P>SAUL was destitute of this principle; but de∣sirous of its fruits and effects. Therefore he pressed the man of GOD, and laid hold on the skirt of his mantle, and it rent; saying "honour me now I pray thee, before the Elders of my people."</P>
<P>THIS is the way to have the presence, and blessing of GOD with them, and upon their ad∣ministration.</P>
<P>THE seat of the magistrate is called the throne of GOD; "and he was caught up unto GOD, and into his throne." As they have the image of GOD upon them as his Ministers, and act by his authority, it should be their care to have the image of GOD within them as men.</P>
<P>IT is an honourable account we have of Judah, in a time of general revolt, the ten tribes went
<PB N="13" REF="022506_0012_0FB947B29DEBAEE8"/>
after Jeroboam; "but Judah yet ruleth with GOD, and is faithful with the saints."</P>
<P>IF religion is not honoured and supported by men in places of public trust, the glory of the LORD will soon depart, and the fire of GOD be scattered over the city.</P>
<P>RULERS are called "the shields of the earth;" they are to protect the people from injuries among men, and likewise from the judgments of GOD. When GOD's wrath was kindled against Israel, for their idolatry at the foot of the mount, we find Moses, that pious ruler, pleading the cause of the people, and he founds his plea upon GOD's covenant, and reminds him of his oath. And David, that man after GOD's own heart, when he saw the Angel that smote the people, said, but these sheep, what have they done? "And the LORD said unto the Angel, it is enough, stay now thine hand."</P>
<P>THE attention christian rulers pay to religion in their hearts, and in their government, will be their support when they are called to lay down their commission, and their lives; it will brighten the scene before them, and embalm their memo∣ries when they are dead.</P>
<P>2d. IT is the duty of christian rulers, to pre∣serve and secure to the people, their liberties and properties.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="022506_0013_0FB947B5AF9F3920"/>
THE end and design of civil government is to secure the happiness of the whole community. For this, rulers are appointed; "he is the Minister of GOD to thee <HI>for good."</HI></P>
<P>THE liberties of mankind have ever been held dear, for they are given by GOD and nature. "With a great sum, obtained I this freedom," says the chief Captain to Paul, who replied, "but I was born free."</P>
<P>THIS has been and still is the voice of Ameri∣cans; and our attention to this voice, which is from Heaven, has brought us into possession of the liberties and privileges, we this day enjoy.</P>
<P>AN infringement on these, has ever awakened the fears, and kindled the resentment of an en∣lightened people!—It has overturned empires and kingdoms—caused the stars to fall from Hea∣ven, and princes to walk, as at this day, like ser∣vants on the earth!</P>
<P>IN order to secure the liberties and privileges of the people, righteous and equitable laws should be made, and preserved.—"That which is alto∣gether just shall ye follow," is an injunction from the First Magistrate in the universe.</P>
<P>WE plead for a government of laws, not of men. The law is a rule to try all causes be∣tween man and man by; and it is a rule between
<PB N="15" REF="022506_0014_0FB947B6E59C8A40"/>
the magistrate and subject—it teaches the one how to rule, and the other how to obey.</P>
<P>THEY are the pillars on which the Common∣wealth stands; to them we appeal for a redress of grievances, and into their hands we are willing to fall; but not into the hands of men. They are in scripture, called the foundations of the earth; and said to be out of course, when the magistrate is either ignorant of them, or neglects to support his authority in their execution.</P>
<P>3d. THE christian ruler will hear the com∣plaints, and redress the grievances of the people he governs.</P>
<P>HE will not with Rehoboam, reject the voice of the old men whose years have taught them wisdom, and apply to young men for coun∣sel; answer the people with grievous words, and cause them to say in the bitterness of their souls, "what portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse." But he will enlighten the ignorant; and those that are out of the way, he will reduce to order and obedience, with the cords of law and love. He will follow the example of him by whom he rules, whose work and glory it is, to make peace and bind up the wounds of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="022506_0015_0FB947B86592BA88"/>
CHRISTIAN rulers will consider the infancy of the people, and the burdens laid upon them, and be careful lest they over-drive, and so destroy the flock of GOD.</P>
<P>THEY will lessen the charges of government, and lighten every burden, as much as is consist∣ent with the honour and well-being of govern∣ment.</P>
<P>THE cause of the widow, the fatherless, the orphan, the soldier, and him that has loaned his money for the help of government, will come with peculiar grace before christian rulers; who will hold themselves Heaven's clients to vindi∣cate their righteous claims, and plead their cause.</P>
<P>THE credit of the Commonwealth, at home and abroad, is a matter that requires particular attention: In many instances its faith has been pledged. But christian rulers will remem∣ber, that our father Abraham, was not justified by faith only; and add energy to our faith, that we may as a people, be justified in the sight of GOD, and the world.</P>
<P>4th. WE come as proposed, to speak of the duty and privilege of the people under the ad∣ministration of christian rulers. And</P>
<P>1st. IT is their duty to pray for them.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT is an important trust, and though it be limitted by righteous and equitable
<PB N="17" REF="022506_0016_0FB947B9F1D5B4A8"/>
laws; yet such is the condition of human na∣ture in this world, that the greatest and best of men are liable to err, and are insufficient to ma∣nage the great affairs of state, without direction and influence from Heaven.</P>
<P>GOD is the blessed and only potentate—his essential perfections are his blessedness, and enable him to manage an universal Empire! He stands in no need of his creatures' wealth to maintain his crown, their power to effect his designs, or their wisdom to direct his counsels. But it is far otherwise with his vicegerents here on earth; though they are called Gods, and clothed with authority from CHRIST and the people—yet they are but men.</P>
<P>THE affairs of government are often intricate and perplexing, and dangers eminent and threat∣ning, so that rulers find occasion to adopt the lan∣guage of the pious king of Judah, "neither know we what to do."</P>
<P>WE are divinely bound to pray "for all in au∣thority," that government might be equal and righteous, and that we might "lead a peaceable and quiet life, in all godliness and honesty."</P>
<P>IT is the blessing of GOD, that makes government steady and effectual, and gives peace
<PB N="18" REF="022506_0017_0FB947BB5D139A80"/>
and quietness to the Commonwealth; and GOD will be saught unto, for such an inestimable blessing.</P>
<P>WHEN we pray for them, we pray for the advancement of peace, and godliness, this being the end for which government is instituted.</P>
<P>2d. IT is the duty of the people, to support their rulers.—That authority by which they govern; injoins obedience from the people to all their righteous laws.</P>
<P>AND as they have a painful pre-eminence above their fellow mortals, and an arduous and important trust committed to them by God, and the people; they should be freed from cares and troubles about the affairs of the world.—"For this cause, pay you tribute also; for they are GOD's Ministers, attending continually upon this very thing."—The advantages we enjoy under a righteous administration, intitle those who govern to large returns. Our persons and properties are secured, and we set under our own vine and fig-tree, being protected, by a govern∣ment merciful and righteous.</P>
<P>WHEN taxes are made for the support of government, there is a moral obligation on the people, to discharge them; for government which is an ordinance of GOD, could not sub∣sist without such support.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="022506_0018_0FB947BCDEF77D80"/>
OUR blessed LORD set us an example worthy of imitation, when he sent Peter to the mouth of the fish, that he might receive money to pay their tribute—And injoined upon us to "render to Caesar, the things that be Caesars."—A support, honor, love and obedience, are injoined through the whole book of GOD, upon the people, as a just tribute due to those who govern.</P>
<P>IT is the privilege of the people granted them by GOD and nature, to choose their own ru∣lers.</P>
<P>KINGLY government was never of divine ap∣pointment; but added, as the law was, "by rea∣son of transgression."</P>
<P>THE government, early established in the world among the ancient Hebrews, was a free republic like ours, the sovereignty resided in the body of the people.</P>
<P>THEY were to choose able men; and they were called to give their assent to the laws given from Heaven, before they were put into execu∣tion.</P>
<P>WHEN government is thus founded, according to the divine mind, and rulers chosen, they be∣come representatives of the power and majesty of GOD; and important instruments employed by
<PB N="20" REF="022506_0019_0FB947BE67C2D540"/>
his providence and grace, in the administration of affairs in this lower world.</P>
<P>THEY are intrusted with the lives, liberties and properties of the people, For them prayer should be continually made, and to them obedience given, as GOD's vicegerents, when they rule for him, and for good to the people.</P>
<P>PEOPLE should be careful of censuring them, and encreasing their burden and concern, lest they be reproved by him, who has forbid our "revil∣ing the Gods, or speaking evil of the rulers of the people."</P>
<P>BUT when rulers neglect the great affairs of government—when they break not every yoke—plead not the cause of the injured and innocent, the widow and fatherless, the poor and needy—when they do not support religion, liberty, the arts and literature; the pillars of government will fall, and society throw off its pleasing appa∣rel: "The sword shall be upon the arm, and upon the right eye of the magistrate"—he shall lose his discernment in public measures, and his authority shall be taken away.</P>
<P>ON the other hand when those in authority, move with dignity in their proper sphere, are GOD's ministers for good; and people are sub∣ject
<PB N="21" REF="022506_0020_0FB947C16EB9F5B8"/>
for conscience sake, what a pleasing ap∣pearance does the Commonwealth put on! such as once induced the prophet to exclaim "how goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy taber∣nacles O Israel!"</P>
<P>FROM what has been said we may infer.</P>
<P>1st. THAT GOD in the scheme of grace by CHRIST, provided for the happiness of mankind in this world, as well as for their immortality and glory in the next. And foreseeing to what endless confusion and irregularity the world would tumble, without order and subordination: has with one stroke wrote himself, religion and go∣vernment on the mind of man.—And has sent his SON from Heaven to explain, and enforce, what, at first, he wrote on the mind of man, and to reign and govern in righteousness.</P>
<P>CIVIL government is designed to subserve the grace of the gospel; and the happiness it deffuses through society in this world, should call forth our gratitude, and praise to GOD, its author.</P>
<P>IT smooths the rugged road of life, gives the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of every blessing, and raises in the mind, the most exalted concep∣tions of that blessed BEING, whose benevolent design, is to raise the virtuous among mankind, by small gradations, to happiness and perfection with himself.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="022506_0021_0FB947C457141C90"/>
GOVERNMENT is a link in the chain of ever∣lasting mercy; and those who are obedient "for the LORDS sake" who has appointed it, may expect that their path will shine more and more unto the perfect day.</P>
<P>2d. WE infer.—That days of greater peace and happiness, then have ever dawn'd upon the church and world, are before us in America—This we argue from the ability of CHRIST's person, the extent of his commission, his going forth of old with our fathers; and the deliverance he hath wrought for this generation.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of providence, and the king∣dom of grace are his; and he manages the affairs of the one in subserviency to the other.</P>
<P>IT has been the method of GOD from the be∣ginning, to reveal the designs of his grace and mercy to the world by degrees.</P>
<P>HE promised one, mighty to save, and able to govern soon after the apostacy in the garden; but four thousand years were numbered, before the desire of all nations came.</P>
<P>SINCE he appeared on the theatre of life, the church and world have pressed on for ages, thro' the fire of persecution: Deluges of blood, op∣pression and slaughter, but little benefited, to appearance, by his coming and death.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="022506_0022_0FB947C51DCE7288"/>
'TILL the Angel of the LORD pointed our fore-fathers to this Western World; a land where he determined to unfold the plan of redemption and government. Here they found a safe re∣treat from persecution and cruelty. Savage beasts and men vanished before them, like the dew be∣fore the rising sun.</P>
<P>HERE the church was founded upon the doctrines of CHRIST, and the Apostles—which put forth her branches like the palm-tree, and bid fair to eclipse the glory of the world.</P>
<P>THIS awakened the fears of the country from whence they came, who were grieved at our greatness and envious at our rising glory, and at∣tempted to take from us, our liberty, and this land GOD gave to our fathers; prepared chains to bind us to passive obedience, and drag us to perdition. The great charter was violated, and the laws that were to protect this infant world, infringed upon. "The foundations were all de∣stroyed, and what could the righteous do?"</P>
<P>IN that day of our distress, we appealed to the strength of JEHOVAH, and the justice of our cause: "And GOD came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran"—he stood and measured the earth, and drove asunder the nations, and confirmed us in the possession of this goodly land.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="022506_0023_0FB947C7AFAC6FF0"/>
UNDER the direction, and by the assistance of HIM, who administers on Heaven's eternal plan, we are delivered from the horrors of war, and en∣joy both civil and religious liberty!</P>
<P>WE have been led to frame and adopt a con∣stitution of government that is the wonder of the world; resembling that which GOD of old, gave the Israelites, the seed of Abraham his friend.</P>
<P>WE shouted with heart-felt joy, when the po∣litical ark was brought to its place. Sing O Heavens for the LORD hath redeemed New-England, and glorified himself in America!</P>
<P>WHEN we look over these great events, we are constrained to cry out with the Patriarch, "surely the LORD is in this place, and we know it not."</P>
<P>WE are respected abroad among the nations of the earth, and united at home. GOD has put this honour upon us, and spoke peace to our bor∣ders.</P>
<P>THE system of national government we have settled, we hope, will secure to us, and hand down to the generations to come, the liberties and pri∣vileges we have procured by our toil, treasures, and the blood of many of our virtuous sons.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="022506_0024_0FB947CE04AC9C08"/>
THE choicest blessings, religion, liberty and peace, were reserved in the counsels of GOD, for thee, O America!</P>
<P>AND what GOD has done for our fathers, and for us of this generation, are but intimations of our future happiness and glory; that he will have a light before him in this Jerusalem, 'till the se∣cond coming of HIM, who is the "light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Israel." Here the empire of JESUS is founded, and these are the halcyon days disclosed to the pious Pro∣phet, in a vision of the night—</P>
<P>"AND behold! one like the Son of Man came to the ancient of days, and there was given him dominion, glory and a kingdom; and his domi∣nion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and his kingdom, that, which shall not be destroyed."</P>
<P>FROM the rise and present exaltation of Ame∣rica, we conclude she is to be the theatre, where the latter day glory shall be displayed; and the medium through which religion, liberty and learning, shall be handed round creation.</P>
<P>3d. WE infer—That CHRIST will vindicate the sacred rights of his government, in the utter destruction of all that oppose his reign.</P>
<P>IT becomes rulers, ministers and people, to be willing subjects of this kingdom, that they may be the glory of CHRIST its King.</P>

THE impious and ungodly will be ensnared in their own plots and devises; and the Heavens will reveal their iniquity one day. "Kiss the Son, less he be angry, and ye perish from the way."</P>
<P>TRUE it is, GOD has done great things for us; he has delivered us from war, and invited us by the dawn of peace, to lay aside the dread artillery of death; he has given us a land that flows with milk and honey, and settled both church and state in peace.</P>
<P>BUT what is this to the sinners of my people, who live in intemperance, debauchery, pride and luxury, fraud and deceit; who violate GOD's holy laws, neglect the duties of the gospel co∣venant, cast off fear, and restrain prayer before GOD.</P>
<P>JESUS, who is exalted at the head of the universal polity of Angels and men, when his wrath is kindled but a little, will dash such characters to pieces like a potter's earthern vessel.</P>
<P>FROM the evil returns we have made to Hea∣ven for past mercies, we have reason to fear the divine rebukes: "You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will punish you for your iniquities."</P>
<P>GOD brought his people of old to the borders of the promised land; but they murmured against Moses and Aaron, and were for making a Cap∣tain
<PB N="27" REF="022506_0026_0FB947D066698AB8"/>
and returning into Egypt. This provoked HIM who had done great things for them, to say "your carcasses shall fall in the wilderness, and ye shall know my breach of promise: But your little ones, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have dispised."—So it will be with the wicked of this generation; with Balaam we behold the glory of America, but not nigh; we shall meet the grave, and the horrors of eternity; and our "sons will come to honor, and we know it not."</P>
<P>WE have solemn tidings this day from the mount of GOD:—The children of New-Eng∣land have forsaken my covenant: Do ye thus requite the LORD?—O foolish people and un∣wise!</P>
<P>HEAR with what irresistable eloquence the prophet Isaiah pleads against the impenitent of this age and country; "Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth, for I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me."</P>
<P>O THAT we may as a people, know in this our day, the things of our peace, repent, and do our first works; that GOD may heal us, and be∣stow those blessings, he has encouraged us to hope for, from past mercies. Then shall we find the grave in peace, and leave this inheritance to our children's children▪ who will read the history of
<PB N="28" REF="022506_0027_0FB947D1EE5B89D8"/>
our day, with amazement and veneration, and call us blessed, when we are sleeping in the dust!</P>
<P>BUT it is time that I close the subject with particular attention to the important political cha∣racters that compose so great a part of this re∣spectable assembly.</P>
<P>AND His Excellency the Governour and Com∣mander in Chief of this Commonwealth, claims our first attention.</P>
<P>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,</P>
<P>WE rejoice to find, venerable sir, that you are again, by the suffrages of a free and independent State, called to fill the first seat of government. You are the man on whom the eyes of this Israel are set, that you should rule over us.</P>
<P>YOUR former services for these States, <HI>in the day of small things,</HI>—and your administration of government in this Commonwealth, are engraven on our hearts, as with the point of a diamond.</P>
<P>IT was under your presidency and direction, that an ancient prophesy was literally accomplish∣ed, <HI>"a nation born in a day."</HI>—America declared free, sovereign and independent!</P>
<P>YOUR ardent love to your country, your inde∣fatigable labor on her behalf, and your alms which have been distributed to the poor and needy, ren∣der you dear to this, and will, to the generations to come.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="022506_0028_0FB947D3A27BA6E8"/>
TIME shall stop her course, and expire in eter∣nity, before you will be forgotten. While reli∣gion, liberty, justice and benevolence, are counted valuable upon earth, your Excellency will have a name and praise in it.</P>
<P>AN holy GOD has deprived you of a promising son to bear up your name, when you become weak like other men, and are called to sleep with your fathers, and by him, who for so many years, was your worthy and pious cotemporary in office:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Honour the late Lieutenant-Governour</NOTE>But he has left you a name better than that of many sons; one that will live in the breasts of virtuous Republicans, 'till our father Adam shall salute the arrival of his youngest son to the abodes of bliss.</P>
<P>WE have not only a grateful remembrance of your past services for America, and this Com∣mon wealth in particular, but we confide in your good disposition, and uncommon abilities, to fill with dignity, the seat of government, where Di∣vine Providence has placed you.</P>
<P>YOUR Excellency will please to remember, that your authority comes from CHRIST, tho' by the mediation of the people; whose religion you will imbibe in your heart, and support in your government, that the people may take know∣ledge of you, that you have been with HIM, by whom you rule.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="022506_0029_0FB947D4FA79D940"/>
THE ministers of CHRIST, who are commis∣sioned by the same authority that invests you, will meet your countenance and protection, though they act in another appartment in the house of CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE University, that has given birth to so many important characters, both in church and state, lean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forward, as it were, and whispers to you her son, to administer to her necessities.</P>
<P>WE wish you the presence and blessing of Hea∣ven, to enable you to act in your whole admini∣stration, under the influence of a principle of jus∣tice and mercy: This will intitle you to the love and esteem of a people you have made happy. This will yield you calmness of mind, under the bodily infirmaties, GOD is pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d to inflict you with, and the cares and troubles of government—this will brighten the gloom of death, and give you boldness in the day of CHRIST.</P>
<P>MAY you long live to serve your GOD and generation; and when you are called to put off this mortal form, may your soul wing her way to yonder bright and intellectual world; where, from the mouth of your Divine Master, may you hear that blessed euge, "well done good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy LORD."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="022506_0030_0FB947D6680AAFC8"/>
HIS Honor the Lieutenant-Governour, claims our next respects, to whom the discourse is now addressed:—</P>
<P>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOR,</P>
<P>IT has pleased GOD to spare your important life, to see the fruit of your labor and anxiety, in years past, and to awaken the attention of the peo∣ple to call upon you, to exert your talents and abilities for the good of this Commonwealth, at a time when the voice of men, whose years have taught them, is needed.</P>
<P>YOUR integrity, patriotism and devotedness to the cause of your country, has given you favor, and kindled in the minds of the people, esteem and veneration, that time will not obliterate.</P>
<P>THE Recording Angle will not silently pass by your labor and attention, when we came over Jordan with our staff.</P>
<P>THE laws of justice and gratitude, which are the laws of GOD, require that we accept it with thankfulness to you, and more especially to that GOD, who has made you so instrumental in deli∣vering us from tyranny and oppressive power.</P>
<P>WE have a recent remembrance of the critical day, when His Excellency and your Honor, were excluded a pardon, by those who were bound to ask pardon of GOD and America, for their insults and cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="022506_0031_0FB947D7DCEA0210"/>
YOU have lived to see your desires accomplish∣ed; the Temple of Liberty raised—and the glory of America, sounded through the world by the trump of Fame!—Now your eyes behold this, you are ready to adopt the words of Simeon, when he clasped the infant Saviour in his arms, "now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for I have seen thy salvation."</P>
<P>WE look to you, honoured sir, and expect that you conspire with your best endeavours, to make easy and happy, this great people: And may a grateful people, by their returns of honor and jus∣tice, equal your past, and their expectations of your future services.</P>
<P>MAY GOD have you in his holy keeping; make the remainder of your days comfortable and happy, and when he shall see fit to discharge you from further services below, may you shine forth with resplendent glory in the kingdom of the Redeemer above.</P>
<P>AND may the Honourable COUNCIL, so ne∣cessary and important a Branch in government, be counselled and directed of GOD; and in all matters that come before them, act with stability and firmness, being influenced by that wisdom which is from above.</P>
<P>MAY your piety and virtue, gentlemen, recom∣mend you to the favour and protection of Heaven;
<PB N="33" REF="022506_0032_0FB947DAE0A28DA0"/>
and your integrity and uprightness of conduct, render you more and more objects of the love and confidence of your brethren. But if your la∣bour and fidelity, should not meet the approba∣tion of the world, as it is often the case, you will have within you, conscious worth—before you, an animating prospect of the acceptance of GOD, and a reward in the world to come.</P>
<P>THE Honourable the SENATE, and the Ho∣nourable the HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES, claim the attention of the Preacher, and to whom he would now turn his discourse.</P>
<P>YOU are this day, respectable gentlemen, con∣stituted the ordinance of GOD, for good; and, having received authority from CHRIST, and the people, you have before you a very weighty con∣cern, to promote the best interest of the people, and see that the Commonwealth receive no detri∣ment.</P>
<P>THE miltitude of your brethren have put con∣fidence in you, and made you the keepers of their vineyard. You will regard, gentlemen, the sa∣cred inclosure of CHRIST, and be nursing fathers to his church, and people. We look to you for equal and righteous laws, and a pattern of every virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="022506_0033_0FB947DD2B5093C8"/>
You will remember, that government came into the world, on the same benevolent errand its Divine Author did, not to perplex and destroy men's lives, but to enlighten, reform and save them: And if there are any laws too sanguine in the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of life and death, you will adopt some other punishment than that of sending souls un∣prepared, to the tribunal of GOD.</P>
<P>BE not unmindful, sirs, that the eyes of GOD are upon you in your public capacity: He ob∣serves what attention you pay to the concerns of the public—to the widow and fatherless, the poor and needy, and the cause of virtue and religion. To him you are accountable, and before his awe∣ful tribunal you must soon stand, with the mean∣est of your brethren.</P>
<P>You are called Gods, let your compassion to the poor, resemble that of the Father of Mercies.</P>
<P>GUARD against pride, coveteousness, and a dis∣position to bind heavy burdens on the people.</P>
<P>LAY aside party considerations and private de∣signs, and do that which you can answer to GOD, and the people. Then you will be blessed—and the blessings of many, ready to perish, will come upon you. And in the last grand revolution, when all distinctions, but those of a religious na∣ture will be forever done away, you will meet the approbation of HIM, by whom you rule, and your
<PB N="35" REF="022506_0034_0FB947E059F752D8"/>
reward will be great. We wish you divine di∣rection, and a blessing, this day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of the house of GOD.</P>
<P>LET this great and attentive Assembly, call to mind the duties they owe to GOD, and the world, and the obligations they are under to the faithful discharge of them.</P>
<P>OF infinite importance is it to us, christian friends, that we are possessed of that faith in, and faithfulness to CHRIST, which the gospel consti∣tution makes necessary, in order for us to obtain eternal life. If we are the subjects of divine grace, and act worthily our part on the stage of life, we may meet adversity with fortitude, and death with comfort—for it will reach us to a world, where GOD will be the sun, in which he will run through our souls with a torrent of delight. On this pleasing hope and joyful expectation, I will dismiss you, until that day, in which may the Preacher find mercy, and meet you all amongst the redeemed of the LORD—and the glory shall be given to HIM, who sitteth upon the throne, and to the LAMB, forever and ever; and let all the people say</P>
