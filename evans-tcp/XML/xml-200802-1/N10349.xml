<Q>—<HI>And these are Ancient Things.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS this is the last day of the first Century, and compleats one hundred years since Wrentham was granted to be a town∣ship, I have been importuned by some to deliver a discourse on so observable a period.</P>
<P>I did at first decline it for several reasons; the principal of which is, my being but very slender∣ly furnished with matter for a work of this na∣ture, by reason of my being unacquainted, ei∣ther by private records, or particular traditional accounts, with the special circumstances of the original and progress of this town.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013136_0004_0F8EC48015440BC8"/>
From this is easily seen what a disadvantage I am under to preach on the present occasion. And tho' at the sollicitation of some of you, I make the attempt; yet I fear, I must unavoida∣bly fail your expectations: there being no more than a few brief hints I can possibly give you, relative to this settlement.</P>
<P>However, though we may not pretend so to trace the special circumstances of the original and progress of this town, as from these alone to collect suitable and sufficient matter for your re∣ligious and pious entertainment; yet we <HI>may</HI> from these, in connection with some of the ancient things of this country.</P>
<P>And indeed it may not be improper; but both pertinent and profitable, on the present oc∣casion, to reflect on those things which laid the foundation of our present establishment, and from whence have arisen <HI>this</HI> and all other towns and churches through the land.</P>
<P>It has been the practice of God's people in all ages to commemorate the ancient things God hath done for them, and to improve them to re∣ligious purposes.</P>
<P>That this was practised by the pious and god∣ly among the Jews is evident from the book of psalms, and divers other parts of sacred writ, and <HI>particularly</HI> from the words of my text—"These are ancient things."</P>
<P>And though we may not so clearly see, at this distance of time, what religious purposes the re∣collecting
<PB N="7" REF="013136_0005_0F8EC480DD653520"/>
and mentioning those ancient things, referred to in my text, might serve; yet we may be certain of <HI>this,</HI> that it was some how serviceable and is so still to the church of God,—for "all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,—<HI>for instruc∣tion in righteousness.</HI>"<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 3. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>So then without taking any special notice of those ancient things to which my text refers, I shall make use of the words to lead your tho'ts and meditations—to the original, or first settle∣ment of this country,—its rise and progress—and particularly of this town.</P>
<P>First, I shall lead your thoughts back to the original or first settlement of this country, and say something of the rise and occasion of it.</P>
<P>Now in order to know the occasion of our fore-fathers coming into this part of the world,—or the reason of their removing from the land of their nativity to settle on these American shores; let it be observed,—That at the begin∣ning of the reign of the popish Queen Mary in England, many of those who were sincerely en∣gaged in the reformation and in casting off all the superstitions of Rome, being much alarmed at the furious storm of persecution which they ap∣prehended coming on, fled abroad for safety. And, having opportunity there to observe the worship and discipline of foreign churches, ma∣ny of them thought that these churches had car∣ried the reformation to a greater degree of per∣fection, than had been done in England.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="013136_0006_0F8EC4816DA3CEB0"/>
Hence, upon their return home, at the happy accession of the protestant Queen Elizabeth to the crown, they became very zealous for a more perfect reformation in the church of England, agreable to what they had seen in the protestant churches abroad. This is the party who were at first distinguished by the name of <HI>Puritans,</HI> af∣terwards by that of <HI>Nonconformists</HI> or <HI>Disciplinari∣ans,</HI> and now usually of <HI>Presbyterians</HI> or <HI>Dissenters.</HI></P>
<P>These good and consciencious people, though far from being pleased with many things that were practised, and required of them, which ap∣peared to them unscriptural and rather the com∣mandments of men than the appointments of God; yet many of them thought it prudence for the present to continue in the communion of the established church, and wait for better days: hoping for a further reformation, and that their discipline and worship might in time be brought nearer to the purity and simplicity of the Gospel.</P>
<P>But after long and fruitless waiting, finding all attempts unsuccessful for obtaining that re∣formation they so earnestly desired and prayed for, and being very hardly treated in those un∣happy times because they could not submit to all things imposed on them, they were many of them hereby drove to a more open separation from the things that were by law established. And not being suffered peaceably to worship God according to the dictates of their own con∣sciences in their native country, they sought it a∣broad. Some removed into other parts▪ Eu∣rope, and found that comfort in foreign churches which was denied them at home. Others sought
<PB N="9" REF="013136_0007_0F8EC482E7E82408"/>
a refuge from the storm in some quiet recess of America, "Here," as one says, "they hoped still to enjoy the freedoms and privileges of Eng∣lish government and to enlarge the British do∣minions: Here they hoped to be the blessed in∣struments of spreading the gospel of Christ among the natives: here they hoped to prosecute the design of a spiritual reformation and entail pure religion, with liberty of conscience, as the good∣liest heritage, unto their children in succeeding generations."</P>
<P>Upon such excellent views as these our pious Ancestors transplanted themselves, families and estates into these remote regions of the earth. Late in the year 1620, arrived to America those good people who laid the foundation of the most ancient Church and Colony of Plimouth.</P>
<P>Sometime in June 1629 arrived at Salem,<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">The Indian name was Naumkeak, but now called Salem from that in Psalm 72. 2.</NOTE> that most ancient town of the Massachusetts, the original settlers of that part of the country.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1630 came over those who first imbodied into church order at Charlestown; but the greater part of these, not very well lik∣ing their situation, removed over to the other side of Charles-river and settled the town of Boston.</P>
<P>These first settlers were few in number—our Fathers were then in a wilderness-condition; seeing nothing round them but uncultivated wilds
<PB N="10" REF="013136_0008_0F8EC483C915F938"/>
and savage creatures; distant a thousand leagues from their native country; enduring various hardships, wants and straits.</P>
<P>But this pious people thought nothing too much to be done and suffered, for the procuring those happy gospel privileges and religious liber∣ties, which too many among us at this day make but little account of. And with great labour and fatigue, and no small expence to themselves (though none to the crown) was it that they sub∣dued and settled this land.</P>
<P>Thus we have seen the occasion and beginning of the settlement of this country by the English.—And these are ancient things.</P>
<P>We are in the next place to give some brief account of the growth and progress of it.</P>
<P>Now this country flourished under the smiles of heaven so remarkably, that it is thought scarce any history in the world affords a parallel. It has been remarked by those who have under∣taken to give us an account of the rise and pro∣gress of this country by the English, that several repeated attempts for the settlement of an Eng∣lish plantation in the bay of Massachusetts, upon worldly views, proved abortive; though under∣taken by gentlemen of considerable powers and estates, and attended with many servants. But it pleased God wonderfully to bless and distinguish those who came here upon a religious account, and crown their noble enterprize with glorious success. It was <HI>that</HI> God, who led the tribes of Israel through the sea and the wilderness, and
<PB N="11" REF="013136_0009_0F8EC48476F44C60"/>
whom the seas and the winds obey, that conduct∣ed our Fathers over the wide and hazardous At∣lantic ocean—that prepared a sanctuary for them in this obscure corner of the earth, and gave them the land of the heathen for an inheri∣tance. We have heard with our ears; our fa∣thers have told us these ancient things,—how God did drive out the heathen and plant them. They got not the land in possession by their own sword, nor did their own arm save them, but his right hand, his holy arm, and the light of his countenance, because he had a favor unto them. God's presence with our Fathers was their shield, their strength, and defence, and the source of all their prosperity, temporal and spiritual,—of their external and moral tranquility and happi∣ness. Through the influence of the Spirit of grace, they had not only the form but the power of religion among them: they were in general pious towards God and righteous towards men: And "godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. 4. 8.</NOTE> And "righteousness exalteth a nation,"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. 14. 34.</NOTE> God blessed and increased them greatly.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">For the above historical accounts, &amp;c. I have been oblig∣ed to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Prince'</HI>s chronology and the Rev. <HI>Tho∣mas Foxcroft'</HI>s historical and practical observations on the rise and primitive state of <HI>New-England;</HI> but chiefly to the latter: How free an use I have made of them may be seen by perusing them.</NOTE></P>
<P>And hence arose in so short a time so many settlements and plantations. The people broke forth on the right hand and on the left and dis∣persed
<PB N="12" REF="013136_0010_0F8EBA750624AD78"/>
themselves on all sides. The wilderness and solitary places became inhabited and the deserts blossomed as the rose. Towns were mul∣tiplied and where there were hideous woods, fields soon appeared white unto harvest.</P>
<P>And this leads us, as was proposed, to look back to the original plantation and settlement of <HI>this</HI> town and the churches in it;—to observe some of the steps of Divine Providence in <HI>our</HI> rise, growth, and establishment as at this day. I have been careful to obtain as succinct and just an ac∣count of these ancient things as I could, though not altogether such an one as I should have been glad to have done. However, what I have col∣lected is as follows:</P>
<P>This township was originally contained with∣in the limits of Dedham. We are told in the Rev. Mr. Dexter's century-sermon—"that the town of Dedham was the 16th or 18th settlement from the first beginning of the country—and that the first inhabitants of that town came from several parts of England; few of them known to one another before they came over." And they are said to have been a serious, godly peo∣ple: and I suppose removed from England into these parts upon the same religious principles that others before them had done.</P>
<P>From this place and people originated all, or most of the first settlers of this town.</P>
<P>This place, as was said before, being contain∣ed within the limits of Dedham, sundry of the inhabitants of that town, after they had been up
<PB N="13" REF="013136_0011_0F8EC485C740A8B0"/>
to take a view, obtained grants of land here. Several who had obtained such grants began soon to make improvements upon them: and at length they with others removed their families and settled here.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">The first English inhabitant in this place, according to our church records, was one Mr Shears.</NOTE></P>
<P>In a few years after this plantation was be∣gun, the proprietors applied to the town of Dedham to set them off; which they did March 27th, 1661. About twelve years after this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> October 15th, 1673, they petitioned the General Court to be e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected into a township by the name of Wrentham; which name, as I have been informed, was desired because some of them came from a town of that name in old England. And it appears from the ancient re∣cords of this town that their petition was grant∣ed and they made a township the very same day they applied to the Court for it:—and that their desire was gratified as to the name. This was done about 53 years after the arrival of the first Fathers of this country, and ONE HUNDRED YEARS from this day.</P>
<P>There were 16 families here when the town∣ship was granted.</P>
<P>That the first settlers of this place were in ge∣neral a religious sort of people, and that the truth and ways of God—mutual assistance and brotherly love were things regarded by them, some what appears from their petition to Court to be a township: but more especially from the
<PB N="14" REF="013136_0012_0F8EBA74E19503F0"/>
covenant of association which they entered into, in their infant state: and upon the signing of which, as I suppose, they admitted others to in∣corporate with them.</P>
<P>Accordingly, before ever they were erected into a township (tho' so few in number) they were careful to have the word of God regularly preach∣ed to them, and procured Mr. Samuel Man,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mr. Samuel Man, I am told, was born in Cambridge, and was graduated at Harvard College in the year 1665.</NOTE> a young candidate, for this purpose: not being willing to live like the heathen tho' they dwelt in the wilderness. This worthy and pious Gen∣tleman continued to dispense the word of God to them till March 30th, 1676; when the inha∣bitants were obliged to draw off by reason of an Indian war.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">This was Phillip's war, an Indian Sachem or King at Mount-Hope, now Bristol.</NOTE> This was a little more than two years and an half after they had been made a township.</P>
<P>Through the preventing goodness of God and their seasonable withdraw, no lives were cut off by the heathen. However, the enemy came up∣on the town after they were gone, and burnt all their dwellings except two,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">What saved these two dwellings from the flames was their being infected with the small-pox, of which the Indi∣ans by some means or other had gotten information.</NOTE> if my informati∣on has been good. We can none of us think but this must be very distressing to those new beginners, although the bitter cup was sweetned with the consideration that no life was lost.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013136_0013_0F8EC486644D22F8"/>
After the Indian war was over, or at least the heat of it abated, I find a number (I suppose the greater part) engaging themselves to return by a written instrument with their names affixed thereunto.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><P>This may be seen in the ancient records of this town. The names of the signers or subscribers are these, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

</LIST></NOTE> And because it seems to indicate something of their pious and good temper of mind, I shall take the liberty of transcribing a few words, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>—"We the subscribers—having formerly had our residence in Wrentham, but by those sad and solemn dispensations of God's providence were removed: yet desiring that a work for the honor of God and the good and comfort of ourselves and ours might be a∣gain engaged in, and promoted at that place: therefore our purpose is to return thither, God willing," &amp;c.</P>
<P>So great was their veneration for Mr. Man, and so acceptable had been his labors among them, that it was their earnest desire he should return with them. Accordingly they chose and sent a committee to treat with him about it. Mr. Man, as I have been informed, was then preaching at Milton, and already had a call to settle in the work of the ministry there, or Mil∣ton people were about to give him one. But so great was his affection for the people of Wren∣tham, and so desirous was he of that plantation's
<PB N="16" REF="013136_0014_0F8EC487452E6E68"/>
going on, that he complied with their request. Accordingly, he and divers of the inhabitants returned to Wrentham again,. Aug. 21st, 1680, four years and some months after they drew off on account of the Indian war.</P>
<P>In the year 1681, the inhabitants of this Town agreed to erect an house for the public worship of God, before the year 1684. And probably between these dates the first meeting-house was built.</P>
<P>Mr. Man continued dispensing the word to them, though not ordained over them, till the year 1692; in which year, on the 13th day of April, a Church was gathered here; consisting of ten members (including Mr. Man) who imbodi∣ed in church fellowship by solemn covenant. And Mr. Man was ordained over the church and congregation the same day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He preached his own ordination-sermon, from 1 Cor. IV. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whether it were the difficulties they had to conflict with in their infancy, or what was the reason that it was so long after their incorporati∣on, before a church was gathered and Mr. Man ordained, I am not able to say: but it was more than eighteen years.</P>
<P>In the year 1719, on May 22d, our church-re∣cords say, "that the Rev. Samuel Man gave up the ghost, in the 72d year of his age." And by a private record put into my hands by one of the parish,—he died in the 49th year of his
<PB N="17" REF="013136_0015_0F8EC4876416A5C0"/>
faithful ministry; so it is expressed. But this must be understood as including all the time he preached in this place before his ordination: for from <HI>that</HI> to his death was but about twenty∣seven years.</P>
<P>By what I have heard of him he was a man of good erudition and an accomplished preach∣er, pious and faithful.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the first men, if not the first, in this Province, and who was esteemed a good judge of the powers and a∣bilities of men, said of Mr. Man that "he was not only a very <HI>good,</HI> but a very <HI>great</HI> and <HI>learned</HI> man."</NOTE> He lived greatly be∣loved of his people and died greatly lamented by them. But christian charity obliges us to think that <HI>their</HI> loss was infinitely <HI>his</HI> gain.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He left a numerous Posterity, and many of his descen∣dants are now among us.</NOTE></P>
<P>After the death of Mr. Man the church and congregation here were destitute of a pastor a∣bout seven months; when this breach was made up in the happy settlement of the Rev. Henry Messinger, who was ordained to the pastoral office December 5th, 1719.</P>
<P>About two years after his ordination, in the year 1721, the second house for the public wor∣ship of God was built in this place, larger and more commodious than the former. Hither, to this second erected house did all the tribes of the Lord, or in other words all the people in the town repair to worship, 'till August 29th, 1737: when by the good hand of God upon them they were so multiplied, prospered and succeeded, that
<PB N="18" REF="013136_0016_0F8EC48AD980F610"/>
they became two bands; for the people of the west part of the town, at their request, were then set off into a distinct parish by themselves. The brethren being dismissed from this church here, were formed into a new church-body there, February 16th, 1738. And the Rev. Elias Ha∣ven was unanimously called to settle in the work of the sacred ministry among them on the 23d of March following: and was solemnly ordain∣ed over them on the 8th day of November, the same year.</P>
<P>Mr. Messinger continued in this first parish, greatly labouring in word and doctrine, till it pleased the Sovereign Lord of life and death to put a period to his life and work nearly toge∣ther.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">He was confined but a few days, and I think preached the sabbath, or the sabbath but one before his death.</NOTE> And when he was dismissed from his faith∣ful labours here below, we trust he was received to his glorious reward above; and that no in∣considerable number of his flock and others will be his joy and crown in the day of Christ's appearing.</P>
<P>He departed this life March 30th, 1750, in the 55th year of his age, and 32d year of his faithful ministry.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">He was a gentleman of unblemished reputation, and highly esteemed for his piety and virtue. He had the cha∣racter of a plain, faithful, affectionate, and profitable preach∣er. And though he was but of a slender, feeble constituti∣on, yet he was abundant in labours among the people of his charge, and spared no pains for promoting the interest of the Redeemer and the good of souls. It is no wonder then, that when all the congregation saw he was dead they mourned for <HI>him,</HI> as Israel did for Aaron.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="013136_0017_0F8EC48BEA669570"/>
After his decease, the church and congrega∣tion here were destitute near nine months, which brings down the time to the present settlement.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The present pastor was ordained December 5th, 1750.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Rev. Elias Haven, pastor of the west pa∣rish, was taken off from his ministerial labours by bodily weakness, contracting a consumptive habit, for several years, and was able to preach but very little during that time,<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">I think Mr. Haven preached but very seldom for five or six years or more before his death.—And I would re∣cord it to the honor of that people, that they procured preach∣ing most of that time at their own charge, or with but very little expence to their pastor, and allowed him the whole, or most of his annual stipend, till he removed to that world where we trust he is now reaping better than those carnal things.</NOTE> to the no small afflic∣tion of his parishioners who were thereby de∣prived of his excellent sermons and other per∣formances, which they were very passionately fond of.</P>
<P>After ineffectual endeavors for the recovery of his health by change of air, use of medicine, and an exact regimen, he fell a prey to that dis∣order, and departed this life August 10th, 1754, in the 41st year of his age and 16th of his mi∣nistry. He was esteemed a gentleman of good powers and abilities, happily gifted and well furnished and qualified, for the work of the gos∣pel ministry—A man of undissembled piety and virtue, and truly faithful in the trust com∣mitted to him by the great Head of the Church. During his long continued weakness he appeared to be far from an impatient spirit and temper,
<PB N="20" REF="013136_0018_0F8EC48CAB7A10E0"/>
and very much resigned to the all-disposing will of his heavenly Father. When the important hour of his departure drew near, he appeared calm and serene—Neither from his counte∣nance, nor from any word or action, could be dis∣covered the least perturbation or trouble of mind,—they rather indicated a divine tranquility and composure of soul. The king of terrors being thus disarmed of his sting, he seemed to welcome his approach, and to view him as a kind messen∣ger of peace, sent from Him who is the Lord of death to set his soul at liberty from a world of sin, cares, and sorrows, to go to a world of holi∣ness and everlasting rest.</P>
<P>Accordingly he chearfully resigned up his spirit into the gracious arms of his Redeemer, <HI>big</HI> with the hopes and expectations of entering into his Master's joy.—Nor have I ever found any that were disposed to think that these were but the hopes of a self-deceived hypocrite,—but all rather tho't them to be well founded, and that while he was lamented on earth, He in his better part was triumphing in the regions of bliss.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author was personally acquainted with Mr. Haven,—had intimate converse with him, and was with him not long before his death; therefore had opportunity to ob∣serve something of the flame and temper of his mind dur∣ing his long weakness and at the closing scene.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have said the more of these two gentlemen last mentioned that have been in the ministry a∣mong you, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Messi'rs Messinger and Haven, because many of you here present can testify to the truth of what I have declared about them.
<PB N="21" REF="013136_0019_0F8EC48D6ED1F258"/>
Ye yourselves can witness not only to the purity of their doctrine, but how holily and un∣blameably they walked before you in love. Their memory I know is still dear to you, even to this day,—Nor will some of you easily for∣get that they were your spiritual Fathers in Christ, and helpers of your faith and joy.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Both of these gentlemen left widows and issue, and each has a son in the ministry,—The Rev. James Messinger pastor of the first church at Ashford in Connecticut: And the Rev. Thomas Haven pastor of the second church at Reading in this province.</P><P>Mr. Messinger's widow sometime after his decease married Deacon Jonathan Simson of Boston, and after the decease of her last husband returned to Wrentham, and now remains a widow among us in an advanced age. Mr. Messinger also left several daughters, four of which were married to ministers:—of these, three are now living. Mr. Haven's widow not long after followed her deceased partner.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>After Mr. Haven's decease the west parish was vacant about six years, when the breach was made up in the happy settlement of the Rev. Caleb Barnum, who was ordained to the pastoral office June 4th, 1760. He carried on the work of the Lord there,—faithfully performing the work of the ministry, 'till unhappy difficulties arising and increasing among them so broke the harmony between him and a number of his parishioners, that he thought it his duty to ask a dismission from his pastoral relation to them. And (though with reluctance as to many if not as to the most of them) they yielded to his request and he was honourably dismissed March 6th, 1768.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. Barnum, soon after his dismission from his pastoral relation in the west parish, settled in the town of Taunton, and we trust is a blessing to that people—and hope they will long rejoice in his light and labours.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="013136_0020_0F8EC490C92F8060"/>
After the dismission of Mr. Barnum that pa∣rish was destitute about five years; when to their great joy we trust the vacancy was supplied with their present worthy pastor, the Rev. Nathaniel Emmons; who was ordained April 21st, 1773.</P>
<P>I might add, that besides those in the ministry, this town and the churches in it have been favor∣ed with many serious, godly, and useful persons who have their names and memories yet alive a∣mong us. But not to dwell upon these things.</P>
<P>How greatly hath God increased you! It has been observed to you that when this township was granted there were but 16 families in it: and it is computed that there are now at least 460 families, and 2600 souls. And it is thought that this first precinct contains more persons than were in the whole town when the west parish was set off, about 36 years ago.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Some among us are of the mind that there is a greater number of souls in the <HI>second</HI> parish than there was in the whole town when that parish was set off.</NOTE></P>
<P>I need not tell you that this is the third house, in which we are now worshipping, that has been built for God in this part of the town: nor yet that it is a much more elegant structure than ei∣ther of the former.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">This third meeting-house was finished in the year 1766, and is a very comely, decent house: but some gentlemen are disposed to think that there is one thing wanting in what is called the <HI>Belfry,</HI> which might give a greater propriety to that name, and be not only ornamental, but very convenient on many occasions.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="013136_0021_0F8EC49272209888"/>
As to the births that have been in this town from its first settlement I have collected about 3371.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">The first English person born in this town was Mehe∣tibel Shears, daughter of Samuel Shears.</NOTE></P>
<P>As to the admissions into church-fellowship and baptisms I cannot be exact by reason of the ancient church records being destroyed when the Rev. Mr. Man's house was providentially con∣sumed by fire. From what I have been able to collect, there have been baptized 1457 children,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let it be observed that it hath never been the practice of the churches in Wrentham to baptize any children but those whose parents, one or both, are in full communion.</NOTE> and 106 adults:—and admitted into church-fel∣lowship 331. These are exclusive of the bap∣tisms and admissions that have been in the other part of the town since they were set off to be a parish by themselves.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Since the above I have received from their pastor the following account of the admissions and baptisms of the west church.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>24 Members at first imbodied into a church state.</ITEM>
<ITEM>53 Received from other churches.</ITEM>
<ITEM>186 Received here. Which makes in the whole admit∣ted since Mr. Haven's ordination,</ITEM>
<ITEM>263 Including the 24 first formed into a church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>681 Baptized since Mr. Haven's ordination, including a few adults.</ITEM>
</LIST></NOTE></P>
<P>Of deaths since the first settlement of this town I have found upon record 766.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The first person that was buried in the town bury∣ing place was an Infant, the son of Mr. John Ware, Fe∣bruary 10th, 1673.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="013136_0022_0F8EC49360F0EC20"/>
But I would have it remembered, that I can∣not be any more exact as to the number of the births and deaths, than was pretended in exhibit∣ing the list of baptisms and admissions into the church: because many have neglected to get them recorded. It is probable there have been many more births and deaths than I have given an account of.</P>
<P>These are the principal ancient things relative to this settlement that I have been able to col∣lect, and that may with any tolerable degree of propriety be delivered in a discourse, the pro∣fessed design of which is to serve your spiritual interests.</P>
<P>Let us now endeavor to improve the ancient things we have been reflecting upon to the pur∣poses of religion and devotion. With such a view as this it was, that God's people of old so often called to mind and reflected on the anci∣ent things God had done for his church many years, and centuries of years, after those wonders were performed,—as their remarkable deliver∣ance from the Egyptian bondage—the miracu∣lous dividing of the red sea for the ransomed tribes to pass through—their miraculous preser∣vation in the wilderness forty years, when God fed them with manna and gave them of the corn of heaven, till their introduction and settlement in the land of Canaan, which prepared the way for their future establishment and prosperity. God's people commemorated these and such like ancient works of Divine Providence with a view to God's glory and their own spiritual advan∣tage. And I hope these are the ends we pro∣pose
<PB N="25" REF="013136_0023_0F8EC493805CF4E0"/>
to ourselves in assembling this day and on the present occasion at the house of God, and re∣flecting on those ancient things that have been hinted in this discourse. And indeed, if our hearts be rightly disposed, we may improve them in general to our spiritual advantage and benefit.—Let us then in the fear of God endeavor to do it. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let what has been said of the ancient things of this town and country serve to humble us, by considering the meanness of our begin∣ning as to externals, yet the glory thereof as to spirituals, which spiritual glory is now very much lost, as is thought, in the increase of our temporal comforts. Have we not great reason to humble ourselves under the decay of vital pie∣ty?—How is the gold become dim and the most fine gold changed! Where is the primitive faith, zeal, and purity of our Fathers! What will it avail us that we have, (or rather <HI>once</HI> had) a great name for religion, and have been spoken of as a people among whom sobriety, righteous∣ness, and godliness have flourished above ma∣ny others, if those dignifying excellencies have taken wing! If our present character falls short of our ancient one, and we have degenera∣ted from the virtues of our Ancestors, we have greater cause for <HI>shame</HI> than for glorying in what we have been. How many among us in this place and through the land have corrupted their ways and forsaken the Lord God of their Fathers! And how are we stained with the most odious vices, such as uncleanness, drunken∣ness, theft, violence, malice, strife, profaneness,
<PB N="26" REF="013136_0024_0F8EC4946AADD7A0"/>
and others! As to profane language, though the histories of this country will inform us, that in its first and purest times there was scarce a profane oath heard in the land, yet now how common, how <HI>very</HI> common is cursing and swearing among us! and this not only in our sea-port towns, where it was once very much confined, but in our inland towns, and parishes, and, this vice like a contagious distemper, spreads through the provinces; so that even children in age are heard to take the tremendous name of God in vain, and to speak the horrid and shock∣ing dialect or language of hell. Awful degene∣racy this!</P>
<P>It is granted that there are many sincerely pious and godly persons in this land, and we hope a considerable number in this town, who in despite of all temptations and evil ex∣amples hold fast their righteousness—maintain∣ing a life of devotion towards God, and justice towards men—shining thereby as lights in the world in the midst of a crooked and perverse na∣tion. This I say we acknowlege to the glory of God, and bless Him for it. But then if we compare ourselves in general with the first Fathers of this land (though we are far from pretending that <HI>they</HI> were perfect) how vastly short do we come of their bright example! Does it not appear that we want their ardent love to God, his truths and ways—their peaceable, healing, loving, friendly, benevolent spirit?</P>
<P>I am disposed to think that some of the aged in Wrentham, and who are present in this as∣sembly, can remember when there was more
<PB N="27" REF="013136_0025_0F8EC495151B2AF0"/>
peace, love, and friendship in this town than there is at this day—when the inhabitants ap∣peared to regard and treat one another more like brethren—and contentious law-suits were seldom known among them.</P>
<P>But to return. Do we not very much want their humility and self-denial—their generous contempt of this world—their strong faith and affecting views of the world to come! How many defects are there in the manner of our conduct—in the seriousness of our deportment—in our christian prudence, faithfulness, and diligence! Now all this should serve to hum∣ble us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let our reflections on the ancient things of this town and country excite us to give God the glory of his wonderful works in the days of our Fathers. It is certain God did great things and marvellous for them in their first plantation and settlement in this country, when it was a land not sown, and possessed by cruel savages. Our Fathers saw the hand and work of God and were glad, and they gave glory to Him. They spake often one to another of these things to the praise of God and their mutual edification and comfort. And it becomes <HI>us</HI> the posterity of those good people who bore the heat and bur∣den of the day, to speak of them to the glory of God as well as they. God was pleased to visit the natives of this land with a terrible sickness (of what nature or kind we are not able to say) which cut off multitudes of them; and with wasting wars among themselves, in which many perished before the arrival of the English into
<PB N="28" REF="013136_0026_0F8EC495C2E6E798"/>
these parts, whereby room was made for them. And it pleased God in a very extraordinary manner to introduce and settle this small num∣ber of people on this strange and distant shore—to preserve and establish them, by a se∣ries of kind and powerful providences, in the midst of a great variety of distressing difficulties and dangers—and enable them to do what may now appear surprising to us, considering their circumstances, in their infant state and settle∣ments. It is but reasonable therefore that we should give to God the glory of it.—These works belong to the history of Divine Provi∣dence, which God would have known and read of all men; and justly expects that we should praise him for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let our reflections on those ancient things that have been mentioned, serve to make us pa∣tient and resigned to the will of God, under all our straits and difficulties. The uncommon sufferings and hardships our Progenitors endur∣ed, in their wearisome pilgrimage in this wilder∣ness, in their going into the woods to make new settlements, should not only endear their memory to us, as we reap the fruits of their labours, but alleviate the pressure of our own troubles and prevent all murmurs and complaints. What are our straits and wants to what some of them had to encounter with! They were in perils by rob∣bers, in perils by their own country men, in perils by the heathen, in perils▪ in the wilderness, in perils in the sea—in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. It may be of ser∣vice to us, my hearers, to think sometimes of
<PB N="29" REF="013136_0027_0F8EC49672E484C8"/>
these things, especially when our commons seem short, and we think our fare course and hard, and begin to be impatient and uneasy. It might be of use to check such an ill temper at its first rising, to consider the straits and difficulties of our Fa∣thers, who sometimes had not a morsel of bread, but were obliged to dig up certain roots for their sustenance: &amp; when they could procure these, &amp; a few shell-fish,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ground-Nuts and Clams,</NOTE> they were contented and chear∣ful, giving God thanks. And indeed we have reason to think that the first settlers of this town were far from affluent circumstances. When they came up here, it was not with any hopes to enter into other men's labours and build on foun∣dations already laid. No, they came expecting neither houses prepared for their reception, nor gardens, fields, or orchards for their entertain∣ment;—but a wilderness, where they expected to get their bread not only with the sweat of their brows, but even with the peril of their lives on account of the heathen.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">I have been told they were obliged sometimes to car∣ry their fire-arms into the field when they went to works and to the house of God when they went to worship.</NOTE> We are not to ima∣gine that they had the comforts of life in such plenty as we have. They were obliged to rub very hard, as we say, to support themselves and families and procure what they left to you their children. So then if at any time you are dispo∣sed to murmur at your lot, and repine because you are not in so plentiful circumstances as some others—remember your Ancestors.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let our reflections on those ancient, me∣morable things God hath done for our Fathers,
<PB N="30" REF="013136_0028_0F8EC497834F8CA8"/>
serve to encourage our faith and hope in God, who is still the same powerful and gracious Be∣ing as ever, and ready to appear for all those who truly seek him.</P>
<P>Our Fathers were many times brought into pressing difficulties—sometimes thick and dark clouds rolled over them—the aspect of things appeared black and gloomy, but they trusted in God, and he soon dissipated the threatening ap∣pearances. In <HI>their</HI> affliction <HI>He</HI> was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them. There was a time something similar to the present, when our Fathers were threatened, more than threatened, to be deprived of their civil liberties and privileges: but they called upon God in their trouble and He delivered them. And he is the same God still, for he changeth not—as powerful, as good, and as kind as ever. Let us then seek and serve the God of our Fathers and trust in his mercy, and we may hope that he will appear for <HI>us</HI> as he did for them, and still secure to us our invaluable privileges.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let our reflections on the ancient things that have been mentioned remind us of the great errand of our Ancestors into this wilderness—the spiritual and noble ends of that great under∣taking which brought them over to America, and induced the first Fathers of <HI>this place</HI> to at∣tempt to settle it. It was the advancement of the glory of God and their own spiritual interest▪ in the unmolested enjoyment of the pure ordi∣nances and worship of God, that brought our An∣cestors into this quarter of the world. And you may remember it was observed that the first sett∣lers
<PB N="31" REF="013136_0029_0F8EC497EA9CFB38"/>
of this town professed that they had religion in their view, and that their desire to do a work for the honor of God was one principal thing that in∣duced them to remove here and plant this place. Now, we should pursue their glorious design and build on their foundation.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let our reflections upon the piety and virtue of the ancient settlers of this country and town excite in us a care of imitating their pious examples. We should be excited to this by a sense of peculiar obligations lying on us, as we are the descendants of such pious Ancestors, whose names will be a reproach to us if we do not also inherit their virtues: and we shall de∣serve such an upbraiding expostulation as that in Jer. 2. 21. "Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?" Many were the prayers our godly Predecessors put up for us—solemn the charges, and very amiable the examples they have left us: all which will rise up in judgment against us if we forsake the God of our Fathers.</P>
<P>But to apply what has been said more particu∣larly to ourselves the inhabitants of this town.</P>
<P>Your Fathers, where are they? They are gone, long ago gone to their long home. But, thro' the kind indulgence of heaven and the ten∣der mercies of our God, the children of his ser∣vants continue, and their seed is established be∣fore him: so that instead of the fathers are the children. And notwithstanding this town, as well as other places, hath been under a variety
<PB N="32" REF="013136_0030_0F8EC49999CFC9C0"/>
of dispensations, and God hath visited you seve∣ral times with moral sicknesses, whereby many, both old and young, have been taken from a∣mong you—and some very useful persons in town and church, and the mourners have gone about the streets; yet God hath bestowed innu∣merable kindnesses upon us; and of late we have not had any times of great mortality a∣mong us.</P>
<P>We see how God hath increased us. Can we then ever justify our conduct if we cast Him off? Shall we not be guilty of the greatest ingratitude if we thus requite our own and our fathers God? Instead of doing this, let us follow our Fathers wherein they followed Christ. And whatever appears to have been commendable and praise∣worthy in their characters, when held up to view, let us endeavor to copy and imitate.</P>
<P>They, we have heard, had such a taste and relish for the word of God preached, that they would not content themselves without having it publicly and regularly dispensed unto them, even when there were no more than sixteen families, and probably not so many.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Mr. Man preached with them a considerable time, if I mistake not one or two years or more, before they were erected into a township: and there being no more than sixteen families when they were incorporated, it makes it greatly probable that there were not so many when Mr. Man came first to preach among them.</NOTE> And now, al∣lowing that some who lived in Dedham and had rights of land here bore part of the charge that they were at in providing preaching among them, yet the weight of the expence must have
<PB N="33" REF="013136_0031_0F8EBA7402970E30"/>
been heavy, there being so few to bear it. How∣ever, by all I can collect from the town records, they bore it <HI>chearfully,</HI> and chose rather to pinch their bodies than starve their souls—and to put themselves to some temporal inconveniences than not to have the word of salvation preached unto them.</P>
<P>Let us then after their example highly esteem, give diligent attendance upon, and make con∣scientious improvement of all the means of grace.</P>
<P>They were careful to set up religion in their families, and offered up their morning and even∣ing-sacrifice of prayer and thanksgiving to God, with reading the holy scriptures. May we, all of us, follow them in this. And let there not be one prayerless family among us, nor one house wherein the written word of God is not daily read.</P>
<P>Like them may we instruct our children and servants in the things of God and Christ, and in the duties of religion;—and set pious ex∣amples before them.</P>
<P>And oh! that God would pour out his Spirit upon his servants and his blessing upon our off∣spring!—and by his Spirit and power turn the hearts, both of parents and children, unto the Lord God of our Fathers, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a peo∣ple prepared of the Lord!</P>
<P>I would address the young people and chil∣dren of this town in the solemn language of Da∣vid
<PB N="34" REF="013136_0032_0F8EC49A5B404D98"/>
in his dying charge to his son. "And thou Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind—if thou seek him he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for-ever."<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 28. 9</NOTE> You are, young people and children, <HI>particularly</HI> concerned in what has been delivered. It is agreable to the will of God that we should acquaint you with these ancient things: Not indeed to amuse you with ancient stories, but for your spiritual profit and advantage.</P>
<P>Thus we find God commanding his people Israel to transmit the knowledge of what He had done for them, down to all their generations—that "one generation might praise his works to another, and declare his mighty acts—that the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born: who should a∣rise and declare them to their children: that they might set their hope in God, and not for∣get the works of God; but keep his command∣ments."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm 145. 4. and 78. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>For these purposes and ends we declare to you the ancient things God hath done for your Fathers in their day. And as they, in the first settlement of this town, had a view to you their descendants,—had a care that extended to the latest posterity,—and sought a godly seed: may you be concerned that you be such a seed in reality!—such every way as they wished and prayed for! And let us your immediate parents have the comfort and joy of seeing you our chil∣dren
<PB N="35" REF="013136_0033_0F8EC49D19B75408"/>
walking in the truth;—and have this to refresh our spirits before we quit these mortal a∣bodes, that we shall leave those behind us, who will keep the ways of the Lord and not wickedly depart from our God.</P>
<P>To the aged of this town let me say; as your venerable years entitle you to that respect and reverence from the rising generation, which was paid to your Fathers by the younger sort in their day; so if you would be in favor with God and honored by the youth, you must, like your An∣cestors, be "sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience." And be <HI>shining</HI> examples of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>And as the first inhabitants of this town, by what I can collect from records and traditional accounts, studied union among themselves—liv∣ed in harmony, and like the builders of Jerusa∣lem, strengthened one anothers hands for the good work they came here upon: let us imitate them in this, and all of us "follow after the things which make for peace, and things where∣with one may edify another." May the God of peace unite us all in the bonds of truth, holiness and love! May He give us one heart and one way that we may fear him for ever; for the good of ourselves and our children after us!</P>
<P>In a word, let us begin our second Century with new and better frames, tempers, and reso∣lutions than we have ever had, and make it our constant and zealous endeavor, to express a grateful sense of divine favours in the virtues and praises of a life devoted to God. This let
<PB N="36" REF="013136_0034_0F8EC49D2C0495D0"/>
us do as a chosen generation, a peculiar people shewing forth the praises of him who hath called us out of darkness into the marvellous light and liberty of the gospel—commanding our chil∣dren, and housholds to keep the way of the Lord, that the Lord may abundantly bless us in all our generations.</P>
<P>To conclude, May every one of us in this Assembly be formed by the Spirit of holiness for the service of God here, while we remain in the body; and for the full and compleat enjoyment of him in the world of spirits! And when that great and mighty Angel, spoken of in the book of the Revelation, shall proclaim that time shall be no longer,—strike off the wheels of nature, and bid centuries and generations cease to roll; may our souls be reunited to our raised bodies <HI>gloriously</HI> formed, and we, in body and soul, pass into a state of undecaying felicity; where nei∣ther days, nor years, nor centuries of years, but <HI>eternity</HI> will be the measure of the duration of our happiness! Where, among other delightful exercises, we shall (very probably) with exalted strains of rapture and devotion, trace the history of Divine Providence, and call to mind the an∣cient things of the works of God for his church and people thro' all the generations of time—everlastingly celebrate the praises of him who is the Ancient of days for these his wonderful works to the children of men—and admire the sur∣prising displays of the wisdom, power, and good∣ness of the Godhead in them all!</P>
