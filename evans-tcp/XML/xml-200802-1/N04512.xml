<Q>—Then the Men of <HI>David</HI> sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to Battle, that thou quench act the Light of <HI>Israel.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Mutual good Affection between Prince and People, engaging them to their respective Duties, and shewing itself in the Expressions of a tender Con∣cern for the Safety and Comfort of each other, is always desireable, and perculiarly so in perilous Times. 'Tis (if I mistake not) exemplify'd in this historical Passage of sacred Scripture; and may, on the present Occasion, be seasonably recommended therefrom.</P>
<P>The great King <HI>David</HI> was Man of War, emi∣nently qualified, not only to sit on the Throne, and judge his Pople, but also to march at the Head of Armies into the Field, and fight their Battles. And
<PB N="2" REF="005602_0005_1026A91AC02E3808"/>
by his martial Skill and Atchievements, as well as by his consummate Policy, just and pious Admini∣stration, his Reign was glorious to himself, and happy to his Subjects. It seems to be in the latter End of it, when he was weaken'd with Age, that we here find him at War with the <HI>Philistines,</HI> in which he <HI>waxed saint. Ishhi-henob,</HI> which was of the Sons of the Giant, perceiving that <HI>David</HI>'s Strength fail'd him, set upon him with greater Fury, and thought to have slain the King,
and so defeated the Host of <HI>Israel.</HI> But <HI>Abishai,</HI> the Son <HI>Zeruiah,</HI> succoured him, and smote the <HI>Philistine,</HI> and killed him. Up∣on the King's escaping so great a Danger, his Men resolv'd in Council, and confirm'd it with an Oath, that he should go no more out with them to Battle, should never again so hazard his precious and impor∣tant Life, as he had often done, for the Safety of his People; left by his Death the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> should be <HI>quenched.</HI>—Some useful and pertinent Instructions may be gather'd from this Text: All that I shall offer may be comprized in this general Observation, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That People should be concern'd for the Preserva∣tion of a good Ruler, who is their Light, and does for their Sakes incur great Difficulties and Hazards.</P>
<P>The Character and Work of a good Ruler, and the Duty of an obliged People, will come under Consideration in this Discourse.</P>
<P>Prop. I. <HI>That a good Ruler is the Light of his People.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="005602_0006_1026A91C4A093E90"/>So the Men of <HI>David</HI> justly thought, and pro∣nouc'd him to be, <HI>the Light of</HI> Israel. And the Spirit of God spake by him in the same Stile of any other Man that ruleth as he ought. 2 Sam. 23. 3, 4. <HI>The God of</HI> Israel <HI>said, the Rock of</HI> Israel <HI>spake to me; He that ruleth over Men must be Just, ruling in the Fear of God. And be shall be as the Light the Morning, when the Sun riseth, even a Morning with∣out Clouds</HI>—.It is compared to the Light of the Sun, rising clear after a darksome and cold Night, and dis∣pensing all about, it's chearful Rays and kindly In∣fluences.</P>
<P>Light is an Emblem of Authority. It is the First∣born of Things visible: Hath the Pre-eminence a∣mong them, or Predominancy over them: Was ori∣ginally created and designed to bear Sway in the na∣tural World. God made two great Lights <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. I. I6.</NOTE>; the greater Light to rule the Day, and the lesser Light to rule the Night: He made the Stars also, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job. 38. 33.</NOTE> and set the Dominion of them in the Earth. He repre∣sents his own supreme and universal governing Au∣thority, by Light: Takes it for his Robe of Royalty.—<HI>O Lord, thou art very great, thou art clothed with Honour and Majesty. I'll be coverest thy self with Light, as with a Garment,</HI> Psal. 104. I, 2. And his blessed Son, to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is given, wears the same Character: And is called in <HI>Balain</HI>'s Prophecy of him, a <HI>Star,</HI> and a <HI>Sceptre</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Numb. 24. 17.</NOTE> And every Man, who, as God's Mini∣ster, and Christ's Representative, is vested with ru∣ling Power, of any Degree in the Scale of Govern∣ment,
<PB N="4" REF="005602_0007_1026A9209A368688"/>
and exercises it to the good End for which it is delegated to him, is the Light of a People.</P>
<P>He is so,</P>
<P N="1">I. As he is their <HI>Guide.</HI> The Use and Benefit of Light is to make us see, to direct us in our Way. Of such Advantage is a good Ruler unto his People, enlightning them with Knowledge of the Things, of their Peace, directing them in the Pursuit thereof, and pointing out to them the Way of their Duty and Safety. Job. 29. 25. <HI>I chose out their Way, and fat Chief, and dwelt as King in the Army.</HI> By a wise and understanding Heart, a penetrating Judgment, a provident descrying of Mischiefs or Advantanges, which may acrue to, or be averted from the Public, by a careful Inspection of the State and Manners of People, and strict Observance of their varying Circumstances: By a divine Sentence in his Lips, when his Mouth transgresseth not in Judgment; by pre∣scribing Rules of Justice and Equity for all Relations and Conditions of Men, and Kinds of Commerce, in humane Society; by resolving of Doubts, and de∣ciding of Controversies, and exhibiting a bright Example of Piety and Virtue, a Ruler is the direct∣ing Light of his People.</P>
<P N="2">2. A good Ruler is the <HI>Comfort</HI> and <HI>Joy,</HI> and so the Light of his People. <HI>Truly Light is sween, and a pleasant Thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun.</HI> It cheers the Heart, by working on the Spi∣rits, as well as pleases the Eyes: Warms and enli∣vens universal Nature, all sensitive and vegetable Creatures: It is benign in its Influence, and produc∣tive
<PB N="5" REF="005602_0008_1026A922F4567FA0"/>
of sweet Fruits : And so doth aptly set forth what a good Ruler is to his People, their Joy and Comfort. <HI>When the Righteous are in Authority, the People rejoice. The King by Judgment stablisheth the Land</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 29. 2, 4.</NOTE>: For then Justice is administred, Peace and good Order preserved, the Conveniences of humane Life are safely enjoy'd; Vice is corrected, and Ver∣tue encouraged. Innumerable are the Benefits which People receive from a good Government. The plea∣sant Fruits of it, the Fruits of Righteousness and Peace, are more to be rejoiced in, than the precious Fruits brought forth by the Sun, and the precious Things put forth by Moon; and the Influences of it are sweeter than the Influences of the Pleiades, and ex∣tend far and wide. A good Ruler, seeking the Wealth of his People, and speaking Peace to them, is accep∣ted of them, and is <HI>as he that comforteth the Mourners.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A good Ruler is the Light, for he is the <HI>Glory</HI> of his People. Light and Glory are equivalent Terms. The Light is bright and glistering, and makes other Things conspicuous and beautiful. A good Ruler is illustrious, bearing the Image of God's Authority, and shining with the Rays of his Majesty: He puts on Righteousness, and it cloaths him with Honour, and his Judgment is as a Robe of Light, and Diadem of Beauty. His Piety is a sparkling Gem in his Crown, and his Glory is reflected on his People. They are dignified and beautified with it. He scattereth away all Evil with his Eyes: Whatever is the Reproach and Obscurity of a People. He saveth them from
<PB N="6" REF="005602_0009_1026A9261ED34028"/>
those Things which would bring or keep them low. He procureth their Advancement, makes them high and honourable among the Nations; spreads a Lustre upon them, and renders them conspicuous and fa∣mous—is the Beauty of <HI>Israel</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. I. I9.</NOTE>. It is by a King's reigning in Righteousness, and gloriously, that the Common-wealth is not over-clouded with Adversity that the public State becomes serene, and the Face of Things becomes beautiful: "As when the Sun shineth brightly, there is a clear Day, and fair Weather over the World". In these Respects is a good Ru∣ler the Light of his People.</P>
<P>Prop. II. <HI>That a good Ruler, for the Sake of his People, incurreth many Difficulties and Hazards.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>David</HI> was spirited for, and often personally enagaged in the Toils and Perils of War, and the <HI>Light of Israel</HI> was sorely struck at, and near being quench'd, by the Sword of the Gigantic <HI>Philistine,</HI> who thought to have slain him, when he waxed faint in Battle, which occasion'd his Men to say to him, as in the Text. He usually, with his Soldiers, jeoparded his own Life in the high Places of the Field, in the Cause of God and <HI>Israel.</HI> He shewed there∣by his affectionate Care of his People, and Zeal to defend them. Every good Ruler, like <HI>David,</HI> is ready, for his People's sake, to engage in difficult and dangerous Enterprizes, when called thereto in Pro∣vidence. The Safety of the People is the End of his Office, and his End in undertaking it; which that he may procure, he more or less exposes their Light
<PB N="7" REF="005602_0010_1026A9287AE47250"/>
to be quenched. His Work is arduous, in Propor∣tion to the Degree of his Authority: Cannot be per∣formed with Ease, nor without Danger to himself. If he be not, for the Defence of his People, call'd to undergo the Fatigues and Perils of War, yet there are others, great and many, which he cannot be ex∣cus'd from. His whole Business is a Warfare, in respect of painful Exercises; the Toils he must sus∣tain; the Wacthfulness and Diligence he must use; Enemies he must encounter, and Opposition he has to grapple with. His Office is laborious and vexa∣tious, accompanied with Varieties of Care and Fear Trouble and Temptation, and is hard to be dischar∣ged well or wisely. He is God's Minister, <HI>attending continually upon this very Thing,</HI> Rom. I3. 6.</P>
<P>Close Application, Constancy and Patience are re∣quired to the Accomplishment of it. <HI>The Care of his People</HI> cometh on him daily; and is a Weight under which he is liable to sink and sometimes ready to complain, as <HI>Moses,</HI> Numb. 11.11, 12. <HI>Where∣fore hast thou afflicted thy Servant? And wherefore have I not found Favour in thy Sight, that thou layest the Burden of all this People upon me? Have I con∣ceived all this People? Have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy Bosom (as a nursing Father heareth the suckling Child.)</HI> More Burden proportionably must this needs be to the Flesh and Mind, than the private Man finds that hath only a Family to provide for and govern; which yet would seem intollerable, were it not for natural Affection, the Strength of parental Love.</P>
<P>Ignorant and inconsiderate must they be, who sup∣pose the Man that doth the Work of a Ruler faith∣fully, hath an easy Task; and can live in Idleness,
<PB N="8" REF="005602_0011_1026A92B02F00788"/>
Pleasure and Excess, The Trees in <HI>Jotham</HI>'s Para∣ble teach us better <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges 9.</NOTE> The Olive-Tree must leave her Fatness the Fig-Tree her Sweetness and good Fruit, and the Vine her Wine, to be promoted over the Trees. He denies himself that understandingly and uprightly accepts the Rule over Men. <HI>Men of high Degree are a Lye</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. 62.9.</NOTE> This he said to unde∣ceive us, who, by Experience of their State, knew what they were: That they are not what to vulgar Eyes they appear to be: Not so safe, comfortable and happy in their Exaltataion. Their outward glit∣tering Shew deceiveth their careless Spectators, who see not their real Condition. "Tho' the cloathing of Authority be splendid, the Substance thus covered is extraordinary Labour, and Duty, and Suffering". <HI>Much Study is a Weariness to the Flesh,</HI> says the wise King <HI>Solomon</HI>; who doubtless found it so in his Re∣searches not only into the Mysteries of Nature, but also into the Intricacies and Depths of Policy. It is apt, sooner than bodily Labour, to waste the Strength, to consume the Spirits, and put out the Lamp of Life. He that is to be a Light unto a People, hath great Occasion for it, to discern between Good and Bad, to search out all Matters involv'd in Darkness and Perplexity; to frame Laws which may answer the good Intention of them; the Sense of which may not easily be perverted, nor the Force evaded; to apply the general Rules of Justice to the great Variety of particular Cases; to devise Means for the Redress of public Grievances, and the Prevention of impend∣ing Mischiefs, and Emolument of the Republic; to manage with Discretion the Affairs of Governmen which are very important, and often embarrast.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005602_0012_1026A92D64A7BE48"/>A Ruler meets with Difficulty in his Work, from the perverse Spirits, and rebellious Lusts of Men, whence come Murmurings and Fightings against him, to the Grief and Disquietude of his Mind. It is not so hard for him to bear the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. 1.12.</NOTE> <HI>Cumbrance</HI> of the Peo∣ple, as their <HI>Strife.</HI></P>
<P>The Light of a People is wont to offend sore Eyes; and who can stand before <HI>Envy,</HI> that fixes upon him in a State of Eminence, and is seeking to undermine him? —Standing on higher Ground than others, a Rulers is more obnoxious to Storms of Adversity; to the bleak Winds of Temptation: Is in greater Dan∣ger form the World, and him that is in it, of falling into sudden Ruin, by Luxury and Prophaness, Pride and Injustice, and almost every Sort of evil Practices.</P>
<P>The malicious Spirit of Darkness assaults him with all the Strength and Fury which he is permitted to do. <HI>Satan standeth at his right Hand to resist him</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Zech. 3.1.</NOTE> The Light of <HI>Israel</HI> was more endanger'd, and suf∣fer'd more Damage, when Satan stood up, and pro∣voked <HI>David</HI> to Number the People <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 21.1.</NOTE>, than when <HI>Ishbi-benoh</HI> came against him with a huge Spear and Sword to slay him.</P>
<P>These brief and imperfect Hints may suggest to our Minds the Difficulties and Dangers to which he is objected, that is a <HI>Light</HI> in <HI>Israel</HI>; a Ruler of the People, the People of the God of <HI>Abraham</HI>: And he that considerately incurreth such, sheweth a predomi∣nant Regard to the Safety and Welfare of his People, as <HI>David,</HI> when he (as was usual) acted in Person, and risqu'd his own Life, in fighting the Battles of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005602_0013_1026A92FBAF29768"/>Prop. III. <HI>That People should be concern'd for the Preservation of a good Ruler, that their Light be not quenched.</HI></P>
<P>The Men of <HI>David</HI> were so for his, which made them sware unto him, saying, <HI>thou shalt go no more out with us to Battle, that thou quench not the Light of</HI> Israel. They had before manifested their Care of him, in refusing to let him go with them against <HI>Ab∣salom,</HI> alledging, <HI>that he was worth ten Thousand of them</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 18.2, 3.</NOTE>. How they were afterwards content that he should go forth to War, we are not inform'd. There might be some special Reason for his being with them at this Time: Or remembring the old Enmity of the <HI>Philistines</HI> against <HI>Israel</HI> perhaps he could not be perswaded by them to stay at home: But when they saw how greatly endanger'd the <HI>Light of</HI> Israel was, they became more resolute, and with the Solemnity of an Oath told him, that he should go no more out with them to Battle. It was not prudent in him so to expose himself, in whose Safety the Pub∣lic was so much interested; nor decent in them so peremptorily to declare against it; and neither the one, nor the other, is to be drawn into Precedent in ordinary Cases; yet the affectionate Concern express'd for each others Preservation is exemplary. A King sheweth a Regard to the Safety of his People, by going in Person to Battle. And they testify their Care of him, by their Unwillingness that he should. Whether it be adviseable, or not, in him, to put his Life to such Hazard for their Sakes, or in them to oppose it; yet it is commendable in both to have
<PB N="11" REF="005602_0014_1026A93149761A98"/>
such a tender Regard for one another, as is manifested thereby, exerting it self in all proper Ways of mu∣tual Defence. What these Ways are on the People's Part, besides this which we have in the Text an In∣stance of, may be shewn, after I have put them in Mind of the Obligations lying upon them, to seek the Preservation of a good Ruler, that their Light be not quenched; totally, nor partially: To seek his Preservation, as he is their Light—his Preserva∣tion, not only Life ard Being, but in his Splendor and Strength, Influence, Usefulness and Glory.</P>
<P>The first Commandment, with Promise, requires it. <HI>Honour thy Father. Honour the King</HI>; this we do not sufficiently, according to the Obligation of this Precept, by giving him high Titles, and loud Ap∣plauses, and the external Significations of Reverence, in unveiling and cringing to him; but by more substantial Demonstrations of Respect, and affectio∣nate Concern to preserve him, in his honourable State.</P>
<P>The Relation which there is between Ruler and People implies this Duty of their's towards him. It is constituted by the wise and good Governour of all, not for the Safety and Benefit of the People only, without Consideration of the Rulers; but to engage both in a mutual Assistance and Defence. It is found∣ed in the natural Right which Men have to each other's Love and Care, and is designed for the better Exercise of the same. Were it not for this Relation they could not so well be each one his Brother's Keeper. By Virtue of it, the Wisdom and Strength given Mankind, for the Preservation of the Species, may be improv'd to far greater Advantages. As the whole natural Body is the better secured, by having
<PB N="12" REF="005602_0015_1026A93425C41F10"/>
the Eyes in the Head, and the Strength in the Arms. The Ruler is to protect the People by his Wisdom and Authority, and they him by their Estates and Strength. Justice demands this of them: Yea, Gra∣titude constrains them to it. 'Tis plainly equitable that they should be concern'd for his Safety, who is so much for theirs, as a good Ruler is. They claim it as their undoubted Right, to be defended by him in their Persons, Names, Estates and Liberties; and he may claim it as his, to be aided and safe-guarded by them. This is the least that in Equity and In∣genuity they can render to him for the Benefits of his Protetion, and his generous Love toward them, in exposing himself to many Difficulties and Dan∣gers, for their Sakes. And their own Preservation calls for it. 'Tis their Light will be quenched, if a good Ruler be not preserv'd. "His Fall, like that of a tall Cedar, (to which the Scripture compares him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai 2.13</NOTE>) will shake the Earth, and discompose the State". Their Safety hath Dependance on his: And in his Peace, they have Peace. 'Tis their Glo∣ry for him to shine in Honour. All the Members rejoice if one, especially the Head, be honoured; and by having the chiefest Beauty and Ornaments of the whole Body placed there. If a Prince flou∣rishes in Wealth and Power, if he triumphs in Vic∣tory and Success, it makes, as well as argues, a People to be considerable; renders them terrible to their Enemies secure from Injuries and Invasions, &amp; great among the Nations. By his Prosperity they thrive; in his Adversity they share: If he be a shining Ex∣ample of Religion, his Influence on them is great, to
<PB N="13" REF="005602_0016_1026A9381442B8C8"/>
draw them to the Practice of it; as is also his Inte∣rest in Heaven, to derive down Blessings upon them, and their Posterity, even after such a Light is seen no more in this World. <HI>David</HI>'s Piety was for a Memorial before God in <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s Time, and was a Defence to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> against the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Host, Isai. 37.35. <HI>I will defend this City to save it, for mine own Sake, and for my Servant</HI> David's <HI>Sake.</HI> Since a People's Preservation in a happy State, is so inseperably connected with their Rulers, the Principle of Self-love urges them to seek it. To this they are obliged by all the Ties of Duty and Interest. And they shou'd express their Concern for his Preserva∣tion.</P>
<P N="1">1. By Prayer to God for him. Prayer should be made for him continually. To the almighty Pro∣tection, gracious Conduct and Blessing of the Preser∣ver of Men, who giveth Salvation to Kings, hath their Hearts and Breath and Ways in his Hands, should the Ruler of a People be devoutly commen∣ded by them. He is worse than a heathen Prince that makes no Account, and they deny the Faith who don't make Conscience of Prayer on his Behalf. The Persian King charg'd his Officers to furnish the Jewish Elders and Priests with Sacrifices Day by Day without fail, <HI>that</HI> (saith he <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezra 6.10.</NOTE>) <HI>they may offer Sacri∣fices of sweet Savour unto the God of Heaven, and pray for the Life of the King, and of his Sons. I exhort,</HI> saith the Apostle, 1 Tim. 2.1, 2, 3. <HI>that first of all Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and
<PB N="14" REF="005602_0017_1026A9399E45AA10"/>
peaceable Life in all Godliness and Honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By dutiful Behaviour toward him: Readily undertaking difficult Enterprizes, and hazarding their own Lives, when there is Occasion, in Defence of his Person and Government—Cheerfully rendring the Tribute that is due for his Labour and Care, supplying him with Means to support the Honour of his Station in the Eyes of Men, who are generally unable to discern the greatest Excellency, under a poor Garb of worldly Cirmcumstances, and apt to despise the highest Dignity, divested of splendid Orna∣ments—Strictly observing all his lawful Commands being put in Mind to be subject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magistrates, and be ready to every good Work, enjoyned by them—Accepting always with all Thankfulness the worthy Deeds done by his Providence, not unreasonably suspecting his Designs, nor boldly taxing his Actions; not speaking Evil of him, but commending his Vertues, and concealing his Infirmities; and yet not suffering Sin upon him, which may, at some Times, and in some Way, be fitly dispensed, without saying to a <HI>King,</HI> (in the Manner which <HI>Elihu</HI> Condemns<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job. 34.18.</NOTE>) <HI>Thou art wicked, and to Princes, Ye are Ungodly.</HI> When People are thus dutiful in their Carriage toward a Ruler, then are they his <HI>Strength</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Zech. 12.5.</NOTE> and contribute to the Preser∣vation of their Light, in its glorious Lustre and be∣nign Influence. Which they may further do.</P>
<P N="3">3. By serving the Lord, and keeping all his Com∣mandments. Religion, not only in those particular
<PB N="15" REF="005602_0018_1026A93BEF3F2F30"/>
Branches of it which have been mentioned, respect∣ing the Civil Ruler more immediately, but in its largerst Extent, and as comprizing all Duties, toward God, our Neighbour, and our Selves, must be sincere∣ly practiced by the People who would obtain the divine Protection and Blessing for their Ruler, and themselves, that their Light be not quenched. His Safety, as well as their's according to the Represen∣tation which the Scripture makes of it, depends upon their Piety—And by their Wickedness they destroy him, as well as themselves. When the People of <HI>Israel</HI> asked a King, and <HI>Soul</HI> was set over them, <HI>Samuel</HI> said unto them, <HI>Only fear the Lord, and serve him in Truth with all your Heart, for consider how great Things he hath done for you. But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your King</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 12.24, 25.</NOTE>. The Sin of a People often provokes a righ∣teous God to leave the Ruler of them to be misled by Temptations, and drawn away of his own Lusts, into Courses which prove destructive both to them and him. Many Instances of this occur in sacred History. Thro' the Anger of the Lord it came to pass in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> until he had cast them out from his Presence <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 24.29.</NOTE>, that <HI>Zedekiah</HI> rebelled a∣gainst the King of <HI>Babylon.</HI> And the Anger of the Lord was kindled against <HI>Judah,</HI> when good King <HI>Josiah</HI> was slain in the Battle with <HI>Pharaoh-neeho</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. 35.</NOTE> which he, contrary to sober Advice, engaged in. <HI>Moses</HI> spake unadvisedly with his Lips, when the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> provoked his Spririt, and it went ill with him for their Sakes, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106.32, 33.

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>This Discourse may be apply'd both to Rulers and People.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Rulers.</HI> May it not excite in them lau∣dable Emulation to hear the Character and Adven∣ture of the great and good King? <HI>David</HI>? The high Character which his Men gave him, <HI>the Light of</HI> Israel: And the heroic Enterprize for the Safety of <HI>Israel,</HI> in which he so extremely hazarded his Life, and so narrowly escaped Death, as made them sware he should go no more out with them to Battle, will they not aspire to be the Light of their People, and undertake Difficulties and expose themselves to Dan∣gers for the public Good and Welfare; and so en∣gage a reciprocal Concern of the People to preserve them in a high, splendid and useful Condition of Life? God is a Sun and Shield. Rulers, who are dignified with his Name, and do carry the Image of his Au∣thority in their Office, must endeavour, in their sub∣ordinate Place and Capacity, to be the Light and De∣fence of their People. <HI>The Light of</HI> Israel! Exalted, divinely glorious Character! What so worthy Object of Ambition, or humane Desire, can be proposed to the Men of Honour? Can they aim to rise higher, to shine brighter in this World, who (as other Men) are formed out of the Dust, are Children of Corrup∣tion, and Brethren of Worms? This lofty mid glit∣tering Title is not given them to lift them up with Pride, but to admonish them of their Duty; and it no farther belongs to, or adorns them, than they, in correspondent Properties and Acts, do make it good.</P>
<P>That they may answer their Character they must be endued with the resembling Qualities of Light in
<PB N="17" REF="005602_0020_102883718DA33DD0"/>
the Charity and Greatness of Understanding, and Depth of Penetration, the Pureness of Design, the Benignity of Temper, the Warmth of a public Spi∣rit, the Constancy and Activity of provident Care, Steadiness of Proceeding, and in the most diffusive Benevolence. They need be filled with the Spirit of Wisdom and Counsel, as the People's Light, to shine upon their Ways; and daily to shed down on them the Beams of a gentle and fair Administration, making them glad and resplendent: The guilding the Common-wealth, as the Sun-Beams do the Earth. Rulers should be <HI>Light in the Lord</HI>; endued with heavenly Wisdom, making their Faces to shine, and good Works appear before Men. So will they be the greater and more beneficial Light of the People; far more glorious in themselves, and advantageous to others: This transforming them into nearer and more happy Resemblance of the Father of Lights, even God, who is Light, and in whom there is no Darkness at all. It transfigures them in Manner; as Christ, their Lord and Master, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, was transfigur'd on Mount <HI>Ta∣bor,</HI> so that his Face did shine as the Sun, and his Raiment was white as the Light <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 17.7.</NOTE>. How are Peo∣ple cheer'd and transported with this Light in their Rulers, and apt to say as the Disciples of Jesus, <HI>Lord it is good for us to be here!</HI> In it they rejoice and glory; by it they are led and do live.</P>
<P>Such Rulers Will be more affectionately concern'd for the People's Safety and Welfare; and in order there to be more dispos'd, and better fitted, to do all that is incumbent on them, with Self-Denial, Pa∣tience
<PB N="18" REF="005602_0021_1026A940A4013578"/>
and Resolution, which the Grace of God teacheth. They will be more like to <HI>David</HI> in mar∣tial Courage, and a Readiness to defend their People, at the Expence of their Ease, and Hazard of their Lives. When God will pour out upon the House of <HI>David,</HI> the Spirit of Grace, according to his Pro∣mise, which refers to Times after <HI>David</HI>'s Family, according to the Flesh should be extinct, 'tis said, Zech. 12.8. <HI>In that Day shall the Lord defend the Inhabitants of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and he that is feeble among them at that Day shall be as</HI> David; <HI>and the House of</HI> David <HI>shall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord be∣fore them,</HI> i. e. as Christ Jesus, who is the Leader and Commander of his People, mighty to defend and save them from their Enemies: The Star, which he that saw the Vision of the Almighty, said, should come out of <HI>Jacob</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Numb. 24.17.</NOTE> the <HI>Sceptre</HI> that should file out of <HI>Israel,</HI> and smite the Corners of <HI>Moah,</HI> and destroy all the Children of <HI>Sheth.</HI></P>
<P>Let the Counsel of God be now acceptable to our honoured Rulers, who are come into his House, so∣lemnly to ask it of him.</P>
<P><HI>May it please your Excellency,</HI> to whom it is first address'd.</P>
<P>It is (<HI>Sir</HI>) a gloomy and difficult Day, in which you are set to be the ruling <HI>Light</HI> of this People, and made a <HI>polished Shaft,</HI> to defend them. The Province is in great Affliction on divers Accounts; more especially by the expensive War which it hath very feeble Sinews to support. A little Wisdom and Strength, paternal Affection and Care, Labour and
<PB N="19" REF="005602_0022_1026A942F79F7C98"/>
Patience and Courage in a Governour, would not suf∣fice in any Measure, to lighten our Darkness, to re∣lieve our Weakness, and protect our exposed State. There is great Occasion for the Improvement of all the shining Talents your Excellency is endow'd with, to direct the public Affairs, and to comfort and save a poor People. By the incessant Toil of the Brain, the unwearied Diligence of the Hand, the tender Concern of Heart, the unshaken Fortitude of Mind, and Steadiness of Conduct, which our Circumstances call for in a chief Ruler, your Administration hath merited our Praises, and keeps alive our Hopes. It is doubtless an Alleviation of the Burden lying upon you, to find your worthy Deeds are not only approv'd of by your royal Master, but well accepted by your loyal People, who are concern'd for your Preservation in Life and Health, in Honour and Authority. To their Power (I bear Record) yea, and beyond their Power they were willing to contribute their Endea∣vours, Estates and Arms toward your ruling prospe∣rously, to their Comfort and Joy, and your Enemies Terror and Confusion.</P>
<P>Your Excellency's Goodness forbids us to fear that you will not to your utmost serve this People with your Interest in the King and his Ministers, that we may be defended in our rightful Possessions, allow'd our happy, both civil and religious Privileges, and succour'd in our manifold Needs, lest the Province, curtail'd in its Bounds, impoverish'd with War, and sunk under a Load of Debt, should be quite discou∣raged from attempting any further Service for the Crown, beyond what plain Duty exacts, in Hopes of gaining Favour at Home, and that the King will hear us when we call. A heavy Yoke of Taxes seems
<PB N="20" REF="005602_0023_1026A9454FAEC158"/>
to be mostly dreaded—so far as it shall by any Means, consistent with Justice and the public Safety, be made lighter, complaining in our Streets will be prevented.</P>
<P>We hope your Excellency will always eat the <HI>Bread of the Governour,</HI> while we wish that none may be your Servants who eat the <HI>Bread of Idleness,</HI> make a Prey of the Calamity of the Times, feather their own Nests, and serve their vile Lusts. With public Spirit, may your Eyes be always turned upon the Faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with thee, and serve thee.</P>
<P>As the Worth of Religion and Learning is known to you, so you will be the Patron thereof, and of all Means requisite and suitable to advance the same.</P>
<P>Our Heart's Desire for your Excellency is, that by the Wisdom, Righteousness and Clemency of your Government, and the Lustre of your good Conver∣sation in Christ, you may continue to shine in your high Sphere, and in a long Course of unclouded Glory, attending your successful Endeavours to pro∣cure the Good and Safety of this People; that so when you must cease to be their Light, withdraw∣ing from this Hemisphere, and setting (as to your Body) in the Grave, (which you are wisely to consi∣der of—<HI>the Sun knoweth his going down)</HI> your Spirit may ascend above the starry Heavens, and be admit∣ted into the Realms of everlasting Light and Peace, with the Euge from the Mouth of your divine Master, <HI>Well done, good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faith∣ful over a few Things, I will make thee Ruler over many Things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And now my Fathers, the <HI>honourable Counsellors and Representatives,</HI> suffer the Word of Exhortation,
<PB N="21" REF="005602_0024_1026A94727D1AE08"/>
with Respect to the Work of the present Day, and of the ensuing Year.</P>
<P>Let the Exercise of your Election-Power this Day, be regulated according to the Word of God, which at an unexpected Call has been spoken by the un∣worthiest Minister of it.</P>
<P>Chuse for his <HI>Majesty's Council,</HI> Men that will an∣swer the Character here given of a good Ruler, and be ready to incur the Difficulties and Dangers which may be unavoidable, in pursuit of the public Safety and Welfare.—Such as, in their Sphere and Mea∣sure, may be the <HI>Light of our</HI> Israel—<HI>Able Men, who,</HI> like the <HI>Heads of</HI> Issachar, <HI>have Understanding of the Times, to know what</HI> Israel <HI>ought to do.</HI> Such are espe∣cially to be now sought out, in this Day of Trouble and War, of Darkness and Danger. What can be expected, but that the Common-wealth must suffer great Damage, if it escape Ship-wrack, in a tempes∣tuous Season, when the Waters roar and are troubled, the Waves swell and rage, unless the <HI>wise Men</HI> in her <HI>be her Pilots</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 37.8.</NOTE>? What Skill is requisite to steer the public Affairs thro' so many threatning Dangers as ours are attended with? From that Curse, good Lord deliver us, <HI>I will give Children to their Princes, and Babes shall rule over them</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isai. 3.4.</NOTE>! An ignorant, in∣judicious Counsellor, is as great a Solicism in the State, as a dark Light in the Sky.</P>
<P>Chuse Men that are stable in their Principles and Ways, like the Ordinances of Heaven; whose Judg∣ments are not to be corrupted with selfish Views, and Party-Defilements, and the greatest Temptations
<PB N="22" REF="005602_0025_1026A94A5717ED20"/>
they meet with, to give bad Advice, to consent to unrighteous Acts, and mistaken Nominations into Office, to fall in with ill-concerted Schemes, and make wrong Draughts out of the public Treasury, any more than the Light is contaminated by shining upon Dunghills.</P>
<P>Chuse Men that will forego their own Ease, and private Advantage, for the Sake of the public Weal; be ready to engage in difficult and hazardous Enter∣prizes for the Safety of their People; to risk, and (when call'd thereto in Providence) lay down their Lives for their Country.—Such Men are not com∣monly those who are most forward to get to the <HI>Council-Board.</HI> If any appear fond, and use little Arts, base and unworthy Means, to be chosen to that, or any other Place of Dignity and Government, they may reasonably be deem'd unfit for it.—If for Fa∣vour and Preferment, they will join themselves to a Party, deny or dissemble the Truth, contract their Minds, or stretch their Consciences to the Size of the Times, fawn and flatter, offer Gifts, and purchase Votes, they do not shew themselves Men worthy of it. If this were made the Rule of Election, perhaps the greatest Errors in them wou'd be avoided, a great deal of Wickedness in seeking after, and bringing in∣to honourable Seats, and Posts of Profit, might be prevented, and the Public be secur'd from the Mischiefs we always have to fear from the Advancement of ambitious and designing Men. Aspiring <HI>Absalom</HI> said, <HI>O that I were made Judge in the Land</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 15.</NOTE> He caress'd and kiss'd every one that came to Court, and stole away the Hearts of the Men of <HI>Israel.</HI> But in
<PB N="23" REF="005602_0026_1026A94CAED04C78"/>
Mercy to the People, his villainous Design Was frus∣trated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bramble</HI> (it seems) was fond of the Govern∣ment, which the <HI>Olive, Fig-tree</HI> and <HI>Vine</HI> refused, and said unto the Trees, <HI>If in Truth ye anoint me King over you, then come, and put your Trust in my Shadow</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judge 9.15.</NOTE>—pretending sure Defence, and much Com∣fort to be had in the <HI>Shadow</HI> of a <HI>Bramble,</HI> which is apt to scratch and tear every Thing that comes near it—yea, Fire cometh out of the Bramble, and de∣voureth the <HI>Cedars</HI> of <HI>Lebanon.</HI> This the Men of <HI>Shechem</HI> found true in <HI>Abimelech,</HI> whom they made King, upon his representing how much better it wou'd be for them to have him reign over them, than the rest, or any of the Sons of <HI>Gideon.</HI>—For Men to seek their own Glory, is not Glory, but contrary. When the Sons of <HI>Zebedee</HI> desired of our Lord, that they might set one on his right Hand, and the other on his left in his Kingdom, he said unto them, <HI>Ye know not what Ye ask</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mark 10. 38</NOTE>. When with eager Ambi∣tion Men hunt after Places of Honour and Autho∣rity, they know not what they are pursuing: what Difficulties and Dangers, Temptations and Snares, they wou'd run into. They may ordinarily least understand the Business of Ruling, who take them∣selves to be most sufficient for it—They are not like∣ly to prove faithful in it, who cannot patiently stay 'till God calls them unto it. They who seek their own Promotion least, give the most convincing Evi∣dence of real Worth: Which, wherever it is, will in due Time speak for it self.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005602_0027_1026A94F1D6AC6E8"/>"If Men (saith one) understood what Office and Authority is in Church or Common-wealth, and look'd after the Substance as well as the Ornaments; the Work as well as the Honour and Greatness; it wou'd be an eminent Piece of Self-denial for a Man to sub∣mit to the Call of God, to be a Prince, a Judge, a Justice—&amp;c. And Men would as hardly be drawn to take the Office, as they are now to do the Work of the Office in Faithfulness, and with Courage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Zeal for God; and that is almost as hard as an Of∣fender is drawn to the Stocks. Offices and high Places are not intended to accommodate the Fles;h; nor are they Things to be ambitiously desired and sought for, by such as understand the Ends and Use of them; but they are such labourious, hazardous Ways of serving God, which a wise Man knows, must cost him more than the Honour will repay; and which a good Man will not run away from when God calleth him thereto; but will so far deny him∣self as to submit to them; but not to thrust himself into them, as the Proud and Selfish do. He that seeketh an Office, or Honour for himself, must have another Heart before he will use it for God." Wherefore, that we may still have Counsellors as at the first, let the honourable Board be supply'd, not with Men who, urged on with Ambition or Avarice or any wrong Motives, wou'd thrust themselves, but with those whole known Merit, discovering it self in their Wisdom and Integrity, as the Light in its own shining, recommends to it. And this is agree∣able to the Apostle's Rule of Judgment propounded in 2 Cor. 10.18. <HI>Not be that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="005602_0028_1026A951B17B4068"/>When the Elections of this Day shall be happily finished, may the several Branches of the Legislature, each in its proper Sphere, he the <HI>Light</HI> of our <HI>Israel,</HI> in the succeeding annual Course of their Adminisra∣tions, and be carried thro' all the Difficulties and Dangers, which the arduous Business of the Year is like to be attended with. It will require all the Wisdom and Prudence, Tenderness and sollicitous Care, Vigilance, Courage and Labour of the most accomplish'd and faithful Rulers, to chuse out a right Way for this people in so dark a Time; to comfort and cheer them in their Afflictions; to ease them somewhat (if possible) of the Yoke which is grie∣vous to them; to redress the Wrongs that are suf∣fer'd, or, if that be impossible, to prevent in any Mea∣sure the greater thar are fear'd, from the continually sinking Credit of our Medium of Exchange, which is converted into an Instrument of Injustice; to open and keep free Channels of Trade which are in Manner shut up; to secure the People from instestine Broils and Factions; to protect them from foreign Invations and Enemies; to guard and promote their religious, as well as civil Interests; and preserve both State and Church from Ruin. How much Work, and how much Importance and Difficulty, lies before the Rulers of this Province, is easy to con∣ceive, but would be tedious to declare. They don't expect to live in Ease and Delicacy, Idlesness and Pleasure; but to watch Day and Night for our Good, and be very Slaves to Busines and if their should be Occasion therefor, to venture their own Lives in the Battle of the Warrior, to save their People's. Not only are our temporal Affairs perplex'd, but our Religion, and the Minstry thereof, and Means of
<PB N="26" REF="005602_0029_1026A954E2286E38"/>Education, are at present under a Cloud: And so far as they are so, our Glory is obscured—Will our Ru∣lers therefore, as our <HI>Light,</HI> shine upon them, and as far as their Authority and Influence will reach, pre∣sreve them from being corrupted with Errors, dark∣ned with Ignorance and Sin, aspers'd and blacken'd with foul Slanders, unjust Reproaches, and for Want of outward Means of Support, reduc'd to so low and despicable a State, as that it should be truly said of these exellent Things, the best we have, <HI>their Light is become Darkness.</HI> Far be it from our Rulers to espouse a Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in Religion; or to countenance a Mi∣nistry, which is not, in respect both of Doctrine and Conversation, a burning and shining Light. But let them own and promote the great and substantial Things in which pure and undefil'd Religion consists, and by their Example teach People to go in the Foot∣steps of the Flock, which follow'd Christ into the Wilderness and adhere to the Ministry which the Gospel ordains; that so if any should wander after uncertain Lights, it may not be said, <HI>the Leaders of this People cause them to err,</HI> Isai. 9. 16. So far as Religion and Learning shall decay, our Light must dwindle; even that which the Magistracy is unto us. "Despising the Ephod, was the Rot of <HI>Saul</HI>'s King∣dom".</P>
<P><HI>Honoured Fathers,</HI> There is one Consideration, ('tis suggested in the Text) which is proper and powerful to excite your utmost Care to answer the Character, and do the Work of a good Ruler: It is the Consideration of your latter End. Ye are the Light of our <HI>Israel,</HI> but incident to be quench'd by Death, He that saith, Ye are Gods, saith also, Ye shall die like Men, One fatal Moment extinguishes

all the Glory of a wicked Ruler: How great is his Fall, from the Firmament, in which he shineth a lit∣tle while, into the lowest Pit, where is <HI>Blackness of Darkness for ever!</HI> And the Insultation over a proud Monarch, who said in his Heart, I will exalt my Throne above the the Stars of God, is, HOW ART THOU FALLLEN FROM HEAVEN, O LUCIFER, SON OF THE MORNING! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai 14.12.</NOTE> — But they that are wise, and discharge the honourable Office of ruling well and faithfully, shall, as to their <HI>Spirits,</HI> upon their shining no more as Lights in this World, and their Bodies going down to rest in the Grave, be exalted above all visible Heavens, to a Place among those Morning Stars, the Sons of God, his glorious Angels; and when the Son of Man shall send forth his Angels, and gather out of his Kingdom all Things that offend, and them which do Iniquity, then shall the Righteous, and with distinguishing Lustre, the Just, who have ruled in the Fear of God, shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Fathter.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To the People,</HI> I am in the next Place to apply this Discourse.</P>
<P>Common Usage may seem to demand, and my Subject would warrant, a distinct Address to the Cler∣gy, exciting them to approve themselves in their Sphere, the <HI>Light</HI> of our <HI>Israel,</HI> to act as becometh those who are set for the Defence of the Gospel, and endure Hardness as good Soldiers of Jesus Christ, in a Day of Darkness and Danger: But since their Duty is on the Morrow to be set before them by a better Hand, I omit an Application to my Fathers and Brethren in the Ministry. Only as the Exhor∣tation

I bring the People, speaketh unto them, who should be Examples unto all others of the Duty I press, <HI>viz.</HI> A suitable Concern for the Preservation of a good Ruler, that our Light be not quenched.</P>
<P>We have Rulers worthy of this shining Character, whose Wisdom serves for our Direction, and whose just Administration is to our Comfort, Joy and Glory —Rulers that undergo Difficulties, and are expos'd to Dangers, in Pursuance of our Welfare: That count not their own Lives too dear to be risqued in War, for our Defence—We have a King, who like <HI>David,</HI> hath sometimes gone forth with his Men to Battle, and fought in the Heat of it, at the Peril of quenching the greatest Light of our <HI>Israel.</HI> His roy∣al Presence and magnanimous Behaviour, doubtless, contributed very much to the gaining of the Victory over a far more numerous Army than that which he was of late at the Head of, on the River <HI>Mayne</HI> in <HI>Germany. Armies slight the Danger they share in with their King: And if Generals don't act in Per∣son, they can never atchieve a glittering Reputation,</HI> was the Saying of the great King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI>
was stiled.</P>
<P>We cannot impute it to the Love of Ease, or Care of his own Health and Life, that the Governour, our <HI>Captain-General,</HI> is not gone out with his Men to Battle. He hath little spared himself in these calamitous Times. All must be sensible, that he hath taken indefatigable Pains, encounter'd and furmount∣ed great Difficulties, and been expos'd to no small Hazards, in conducting the arduous Affair of the War: And especially in his so wisely projecting, and vigorously carrying on the present necessary and im∣portant <HI>Expedition</HI> against our Enemies; for which,
<PB N="29" REF="005602_0032_1026A95A70022D28"/>
we hope, the Generations to come, will call him <HI>blessed.</HI></P>
<P>We have Ruler under him, that have left their honourable Seats in Court, and all the Comforts of their pleasant Habitations, to undergo the Inconve∣niences, Fatigues, and Perils of a military Expedition: Such as a brave General, and other principal Officers of our Army who, inspired with Courage, and gird∣ed with Strength, have carry'd the War into the E∣nemy's Land; have assaulted, and in Part smitten, the strong Hold, which has been tho't impregnable. May our Forces, thro' God, do valiantly, and return triumphing in his Praise, and we have Occasion to sing in the Words of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak, Judges</HI> 5. 2—9. Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of <HI>Israel,</HI> when the People willingly offered themselves—My Heart is toward the Governours of <HI>Israel,</HI> who offered themselves willingly among the People: Bless ye the Lord. <HI>The Stars in their Courses fought a∣gainst</HI> Sisera. These our Lights are ready in their's to fight against our Enemies.</P>
<P>And now, O ye People, will ye not be concern'd, and do your uttermost, for the Preservation of Ru∣ers, who are so vigilant, labourious, and ventrous for your Safety and Peace: To them, under God, are we indebted for the Light we have in our Darkness, now that there is Distress of Nations, with Perplexi∣ty; Men's Hearts failing them for Fear, and for looking after those Things which are coming on the Earth. As Heaven shineth upon the Government, and renders it so benign, joyous and glorious to us as it is, ingrateful shall we be, if we do not shew ourselvse well-affected to it, and desirous of the Pros∣perity of those of by whom we enjoy any Degree of
<PB N="30" REF="005602_0033_1026A95D9E294870"/>
Security, Liberty and Traquility, in an evil, very unsettled World.</P>
<P>Having Rulers that appear so concern'd for the public Safety, so willing to take any Pains, to run any Hazards to secure and from whose just Ad∣ministrations, and brave Adventures, we reap so many and great Blessings, we are in return therefor, of all People in the World, oblig'd to seek their Prosperity and Preservation,—Let us do this by constant and servent Prayer to almighty God for them: For our King; that his Glory may still be great in God's Salvation—that all his Enemies may be defeated, and cloathed with Shame, and he be as the Sun, when he goeth forth in his Might.—For our Governour, and all in Authority. Civil and Military, that they may be protected in their Person, assisted and suc∣ceeded in their Undertakings, so as to be the Light and Shield of our Earth.</P>
<P>Let us behave dutifully toward our Rulers: Obey∣ing them in all Things, wherein their Laws do not interfere with the Commands of God.</P>
<P>Let us not add to their Burden, and discourarge their Hearts, by any refractory Carriage, and un∣reasonable Complaints. Let not out Light be dim'd, their Reputation fullied with the Breath of Obloquy. Their Honour is necessary to the public Good, and we should be tender of it. They lay no Claim to Perfection: (The Sun hath its Spots) But we should not expose and aggravate their Faults. Let us not admit the Jealousies, which envious, self-designing Men are always ready to propagate, nor join in the Clamours of uneasy Male-contents.</P>
<P>"Most Men indeed, (as one observes) by their Condition of Life, are set at too great a Distance
<PB N="31" REF="005602_0034_1026A96000B7A7A0"/>
from the Springs of Government, to be rightly in∣structed in Facts Circumstances, and much less to enter into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of public Councils; and therefore for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Con∣duct of their Superious, is talking without Know∣ledge, and judging without Examination.

Hear the Preacher's Conclusion of the whole Mat∣ter; Fear God, and keep his Commandments: For this is the whole of Man—his whole Duty and Safe∣ty, consider'd both in his personal and political Ca∣pacity.</P>
<P>After all that can with Truth be said of an ex∣traordinary Reformation in the Land, it is plain, that we still greatly need to be reform'd: To the various Judgments, by which God testifies against our do∣ing wickedly, he might add this of quenching the <HI>Light</HI> of the good Government we are under. Just∣ly, for our Sins, might he desert our Rulers, that thy should be like those of whom we read, Psal. 2.5. <HI>They know not, neither will they understand; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey walk on in Darkness; All the Foundations of the Earth are out of Course.</HI> They may be left to fall into the worst of Errors and Sins, to the staining all

their Glory, and by their precipitate Counsels, ill∣advised Enterprizes, oppressive and tyranous Courses, to work their own and our Ruin. As therefore we tender their Preservation, and our Happiness depend∣ing on it, let us break off our Sins by Repentance, and follow after that Righteousness which exalteth a Nation. Let our Zeal be spent in the Pratice of that Religion, which is the Image of God, and Imi∣tat;ion of the blessed Jesus, in Holiness, Justice, Meek∣ness, Peaceableness and Love. So will our Light shine Our Righteousness may go forth as Bright∣ness, no more to be disputed than the shining of the Sun; and as little needing any <HI>extrinsic</HI> Evidence to prove it. Our Light will shine, and all that is called so be best secur'd from every Thing that would quench it.</P>
<P>When the People of <HI>Israel</HI> desired a King to judge them, and go out before them, and fight their Battles and <HI>Saul</HI> was anointed over them. <HI>Samuel</HI> said unto them, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 12.14.</NOTE> <HI>If ye fear the Lord, and serve him, and obey his Voice, and not rebel against the Commandment of the Lord, then shall both ye, and also the King that reigneth over you, continue following the Lord your God,</HI> i. e. be safe under the divine Conduct and Pro∣tection.—Let us do so: Then shall our Rulers, be∣ing just, ruling the Fear of God, be as the Light of the Morning, which is encreasing, when the Sun riseth, very pleasant, in a Morning without Clouds—In the growing Lustre of their good Government shall they shine more and more toward a perfect Day of Prosperity, <HI>Then</HI> (saith God as truly to us as he did to <HI>Israel</HI> of old) <HI>shall thy Light rise in Obscurity

and thy Darkness be as the Noon-Day. Thy Light shall break forth as the Morning, and thy Health shall spring forth speedily: Thy Righteousness shall go be∣fore thee, the Glory of the Lord shall be thy Rere-ward.—Happy art thou, O</HI> Israel, <HI>who is like unto thee, O People, saved by the Lord, the Shield of thy Help, and the Sword of thy Excellency; And thine Enemies shall be found Liars unto thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high Places—Iwill also make thy Officers Peace, and thine Exactors Righteousness—Violence shall no more be heard in thy Land, Wasting and Destruction within thy Borders: But thou shalt call thy Walls Salvation, and thy Gates Praise—Thy Sun shall go no more down, neither shall thy Morn withdraw itself: For the Lord shall be thine everlasting Light, and thy God thy Glory.</HI></P>
