<P><HI>THE author apprehended, that upon such an occasion, he should act most in character to confine himself to the moral grounds of the dis∣tresses and perplexities of the present day, and accordingly to point out the moral remedy: He willingly leaves the political consideration of them, to those who have had much more opportunity for knowing, and who are of mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e enlarged capacities. He trusts that his intentions in these discourses were good, they were hastily composed; and a critical eye will doubtless perc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive many inaccuracies He hopes however, that nothing will be perceived inconsistent with truth, either upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oundation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reason or scrip∣ture—He needs and he asks the candour of all who may vouchsafe to give them a reading. He has reason to think that the beloved people of his charge heard them with that candour, which he has o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a long sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on met with from them, respec∣ting his ministerial performances with all their defects and imperfections.

<BIBL>1 Epistle of PETER, CHAP. v. VERSE 6.</BIBL>
<Q>Humble yourselves therefore, under the mighty hand of <HI>GOD,</HI> that he may exalt you in due time.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITHOUT staying to consider these words in their primary reference, as pointed out in the context, I shall proceed to discourse upon them, agreable to the occasion of the present day, as I apprehend they will furnish suitable matter therefor.</P>
<P>GOD that created the universe, has set him∣self at the head of it, and undertaken to manage and controul it, as seemeth good in his sight. Universal empire and dominion of right belongs to him, and to none other: Nor is any other being at all equal to it, for the power of all other beings is finite, but the power of God is infinite, and such a power is absolutely necessary in order to universal government. This is a doc∣trine, which reason alone clearly dictates, and it is abundantly held forth in the sacred inspired writings.</P>
<P>As to this lower world, the divine majesty is to be considered as the prime efficient in all events that take place. What ever may be said
<PB N="6" REF="013388_0005_0F90EE5AAFDFC490"/>
of the undesireable operation of the lusts and corruptions of men, their pride, malice, envy, avarice, &amp;c. as productive of uncomfortable events; what ever may be said of instrumental and secondary causes, yet the mighty hand of God is firstly to be eyed and acknowledged. It is a clear dictate of reason and scripture that no∣thing happens, particularly in this lower world, to individuals, or to societies, greater or less; but it is by God's permission and providence, and the events that take place, are very various. And considering the moral obligations that man∣kind are under to God, it certainly becomes them to conduct towards him agreable to those dispen∣sations that he visits them with.</P>
<P>THE words of our text, leads us to the con∣sideration of an important duty under calamitous events.—<HI>Humble yourselves &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THEY lead us also to a consideration of the happy effect, and consequence of complying with this duty—<HI>That he may exalt</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>FIRST, We may consider the duty here en∣joined under calamitous events. <HI>Humble</HI> &amp;c. This phrase here. <HI>The mighty hand of God,</HI> under which men are called to <HI>humble themselves</HI> is ex∣pressive of dispensations and events, in divine providence, that are distressing, grievous and ca∣lamitous. Sometimes indeed it is expressive of Gods favourable dispensations, as when Moses tells the people of Israel, that the Lord their God brought them out of Egypt, <HI>through a mighty hand,</HI> and, <HI>by a stretched out arm.</HI> Deut. iv. 34. God kindly interposed for them, and displayed his
<PB N="7" REF="013388_0006_0F90F4A66ED188E0"/>
almighty power for their deliverance. And so other places might be mentioned: But here in our text, as I just said, <HI>the mighty hand of God,</HI> is expressive of calamitous events. Otherwise there would be no propriety in the apostles ex∣hortation, for men to <HI>humble themselves</HI> under it. Favourable dispensations of God, call rather for gladness and rejoicing before him, than humi∣liation.</P>
<P>I would therefore go on and say, that the great governor of the world is various in his dispensations, not only towards individuals, but towards communities. At times many great and public blessings are enjoyed, the same in kind which Moses speaks of to Israel, and encourages them to expect from the good providence of God, if they approved themselves an obedi∣ent people. <HI>Deut.</HI> xxviii, 3d. &amp;c. <HI>Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep. Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BUT tho' they are sometimes made to rejoice under the smiles of divine providence, yet by and by the scene is changed: Their situation and circumstances are quite the reverse. Wars, famines, pestilences succeed, or come in the room of peace health and plenty. And great fears, distresses and perplexities necessarily attend such calamitous events. And sometimes after long enjoyment of civil and religious liberties and privileges, a people are bro't into great embarass∣ments
<PB N="8" REF="013388_0007_0F90F4A7B88C3A10"/>
and distresses. And their public affairs, their civil and sacred privileges, their trade and business and occupations, wear a dark and gloomy aspect, so that they know not what to do, or how to extricate themselves. Such are the changes and alterations that are made in kingdoms, nations and provinces, in the course of Gods providen∣tial government. And in the language of our text, in all this is <HI>the mighty hand of God.</HI> His powerful hand it is that brings on these distresses and calamities. Thus as it is in the book of <HI>Job.</HI> xii. 23. <HI>He increaseth the nations and destroyeth them, he enlargeth the nations and straiteneth them again.</HI> That of the prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> may be ap∣plied here, chap. xxv. 30. &amp;c. <HI>The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation, he shall mightily roar upon his habita∣tion, he shall give a shout as they that tread the grapes against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In a word here. All good and evil, public as well as personal, is principally to be attributed to the governing providence of God most high, who performeth all things. This is the doctrine of the bible. <HI>I form the light,</HI> says God, <HI>and create darkness, I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all these things.</HI> Isai. xlv. 7.</P>
<P>AND in all public distresses and calamities, it is evident the Lord hath a controversy with that people among whom they happen. This is ex∣pressed in the passage I just mentioned from the prophet <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> So also is it in that of the pro∣phet <HI>Hosea,</HI> and the ground of his controversy is
<PB N="9" REF="013388_0008_0F90F4A82F6E3640"/>
therein mentioned, <HI>Hosea</HI> chap. 4. from the be∣ginning, <HI>Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel, for the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. By swearing and lying and killing and stealing and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</HI></P>
<P>Now when the scripture speaks of God's hav∣ing a controversy with a people; it naturally sup∣poses that he is displeased and angry with them. A controversy between man and man, supposes that they are at odds with each other, that there is some ground or cause of uneasiness and displea∣sure, and hence they are wont to take methods to decide it, each aiming to make his part good, or to gain the ascendancy, that so he may have it in his power to curb and chastise his antagonist. This is no ground for controversy, when an en∣tire harmony and good agreement subsists. So that, as I just said, God's having a controversy with a people, supposes his anger and displea∣sure against them. Accordingly when his mighty hand is lifted up, when he visits them with those evils and calamities we have mentioned at this time, it is an undoubted evidence that he is wroth with them, calamities are so many tokens of his anger. This is very frequently expressed in scripture. I shall only mention that of the prophet, <HI>Isaiah</HI> chap. ix. 11, 12. <HI>Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together. The</HI> Syrians <HI>before, and the</HI> Philistines <HI>behind, and they shall devour Israel
<PB N="10" REF="013388_0009_0F909502C92A92A8"/>
with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</HI></P>
<P>Now the question is, what is it that excites the anger of God, and causes him to manifest it in calamitous dispensations? I answer in general it is on account of their wickedness and rebellion against him. If a people were universally or very generally a virtuous, religious, obedient peo∣ple, it is not to be tho't that the righteous and holy God, who loves goodness and righteousness, would have any controversy with them, that he would bring any evils and calamities upon them, but would be their constant friend, guardian and protector. When therefore he contends with them and greatly distresses them, it must be be∣cause their iniquities and rebellions have provoked him to do so. All this may be fairly argued not only from the holy scripture, but from his cha∣racter as the moral governor of the world. Mankind in all ages even unto the present, must take to themselves the blame of all the evils, distresses and calamities that have befallen them.</P>
<P>THEY must do so besure, if they don't confine their views to instrumental and secondary causes, but regard almighty God, as the great first cause of all events. And no one who exercises a rational, sober tho't, but must be led thus to consider him. They must be led to acknowledge his hand in all calamities, and to consider the moral ground or reason of them; namely, their disobedience and rebellion against him.</P>
<P>AND in this view of things, arises the duty
<PB N="11" REF="013388_0010_0F90F4A99F704F30"/>
pointed out in our text, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to humble ourselves. <HI>Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.</HI></P>
<P>THIS may be considered as an exhortation to <HI>repentance</HI> when the dispensations of the great governor of the world are distressing and calami∣tous. We find God uttering that complaint con∣cerning the <HI>Jews,</HI> when his mighty hand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as lift∣ed up against them, yea, when he let it fall heavily upon them, &amp; they were bro't into sore distresses. <HI>Jer.</HI> viii. 5. <HI>Why then is this people of</HI> Jerusalem <HI>slidden back, by a perpetual backsliding, they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</HI> It is plain he expected this from them; and he waited to see how it would be with them, whether <HI>they</HI> altered their conduct, that so the way might be prepared for his altering <HI>his</HI> conduct towards them. Ac∣cordingly it follows in the next verse, <HI>I hearkned and heard.</HI> I took a particular, critical notice how it was with them, <HI>but they spake not aright, no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, what have I done?</HI> What hand have I had in procuring the Lord's controversy with this people, or in bringing on these evils and calamities? In∣stead of this they went on audaciously and reso∣lutely in their iniquities and rebellions, as tho' they could carry the day against him, and be an over match for him. <HI>Every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.</HI></P>
<P>Was this to comply with God's expectations concerning them? No verily, but quite the reverse. From the passage I just mentioned, it is plain that he expected that they would repent of all those evils and transgressions which had pro∣cured his frowns.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013388_0011_0F90F4AA2E15B6D8"/>
REPENTANCE don't consist merely in any external rites &amp; observances. The <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws</HI> were wont to lay great stress upon these, and imagined they were of great account with God, and what would undoubtedly conciliate his favourable regards and this at the same time that they were grossly and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ously culpable before him, as violaters of his holy and good law. This is set forth in very strong colours, in the 1<HI>st.</HI> chap. <HI>Isaiah.</HI> We therein find the holy God who was perfectly acquainted with all their henious immoralities, sharply and pungently expostulating with them, for their laying so much stress upon external ritu∣al observances, and sufficiently expressing the unavailableness of them to engage his favourable regards, while they went on in their iniquities. Yea, expressing his great detestation and abhor∣ence of them. It was in vain for them to think of substituting these in the room of real righteous∣ness goodness and virtue, 13<HI>th</HI> verse &amp;c. <HI>Bring no more vain oblations, incense is an abomination unto me, the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies I cannot away with, it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting Your new moons and your appointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, my soul hateth</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND then he goes on expressly to telll them, what was the main and principal thing he looked at and what would be most beneficial and ad∣vantages them, verse 16, 17. <HI>Wash ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="013388_0012_0F90950382312840"/>
THOSE things that go to constitute true re∣pentance, are here set forth in general terms, abstaining from every vice and immorality, and practising those things that are pious, virtuous, just and righteous.</P>
<P>REPENTANCE however, I would observe, is not to be considered, as consisting merely in an external reformation of manners, there must certainly in the first place be an inward good disposition. And indeed it is not likely that there will be an out∣ward reformation of manners, in the want of such an inward good disposition. It is not to be expected that there will be good fruit, unless the tree be good, to allude to our Saviours manner of expres∣sion, <HI>Matth.</HI> chap. vii.</P>
<P>AND accordingly, the terms and phrases made use of in scripture to express repentance, plainly show that there is something more in it than what is external; that it consists also in that which is inward. Accordingly, it is sometimes expressed by <HI>a broken and contrite heart,</HI> by <HI>sorrowing</HI> and mourning, which is internal, so also by men's <HI>humbling</HI> themselves, as in our text.</P>
<P>WE have observed that when the mighty hand of God is lifted up, or when distressing calamitous events come upon a people, through the over∣ruling providence of God, it is for the wickedness and rebellion of a people against his holy Majesty.</P>
<P>THE procuring cause, therefore, of such events is that which calls for repentance, and that from all orders, ranks and characters of persons. Public distresses and calamities are undoubtedly to be looked upon as tokens of the righteous anger of
<PB N="14" REF="013388_0013_0F9095044C52ADA8"/>
the Majesty of heaven: who is dishonoured, af∣fronted and vilely and shamefully treated by the impieties and wickednesses that are prevalent a∣mong them. And this is reason sufficient for universal mourning a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d humiliation before God.</P>
<P>THE Majesty of heaven most certainly deserves other sort of treatment than this. The excellen∣cies of his nature demand the highest esteem, veneration and subjection from his whole intelli∣gent offspring. And so does the paternal relation he stands in to them. When his being and per∣fections are struck at, when he is insulted and abused, as most certainly is the case, when many and heinous vices are rise in a community is it to be tho't strange, that his anger is excited, and that he manifests it by inflicting sore evils upon them, bringing on days of darkness perplexity and distress; especially when for a long time he has exercised his patience and forbearance towards them, and caused them to see much good and outward prosperity? Can it, I say, be tho't strange that his offended majesty should lift up his hand against them and make them know feeling∣ly, what an evil and bitter thing it is that they have departed from the Lord their God, and that his fear has not been with them?</P>
<P>Favourable dispensations of his providence, not having had a kindly effect, their becoming a willing, obedient people, he sees it fit to distress them in his anger—to lift up his mighty hand against them—to visit their transgressions with the rod and their iniquities with stripes. And yet such tokens of his anger are sometimes disregard∣ed, and fail of producing proper effects.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013388_0014_0F909505364E6F70"/>
THE prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> presents us with all this in one view, chap. xvi. 10. 11. <HI>Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righte∣ousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal un∣justly, and will not behold the majesty of the Lord. Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see.</HI></P>
<P>THEY receive many mercies (as one notes up∣on it) from God, he causeth his sun to shine &amp; his rain to fall upon them, nay, he prospers them, and into their hands he brings plentifully; they escape many of the strokes of God's judgments, which others less wicked then they, have been cut off by—and yet all is in vain, they will not learn righteousness, will not be led to repentance by the goodness of God. God lifts up his hand but they take no notice of it—<HI>they will not see,</HI> shut their eyes against the clearest conviction of guilt and wrath, ascribe that to chance, or com∣mon fate, which is manifestly a divine rebuke, who regard not the threatning symptoms of their own ruin, but cry peace to themselves, when the righteous God is waging war with them.</P>
<P>How unjust, how unreasonable a conduct was this under the dispensations of heaven?</P>
<P>MOST certainly it becomes a people to <HI>see,</HI> to take notice of the hand of God, when it is lifted up, to regard the work of the Lord, and the operation of his hand. And how are they to see and regard it? Why, by humbling themselves, and learning and practising righteousness. This is the end proposed by him, in lifting up his hand against them. This is what he justly expects on their part.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="013388_0015_0F90950BD1353660"/>
IT is certainly necessary in this day of darkness, perplexity and distress, thro' the mighty hand of God lifted up against us, that there be great searching of heart; a serious and thorough en∣into the grounds of God's controversy with us; what have been the evils and abominations that have incensed the divine anger against us. This certainly is the main thing, and not merely look∣ing at instruments and second causes. For let these be what they will, yet (as was said before) God Almighty, is the first cause, and ought to be regarded as such. It becomes us to be deeply humbled before him, for the many and heinous evils in the midst of us which have procured the tokens of his anger and displeasure. We can't be properly humbled under divine rebukes, un∣less we are humbled for the caurse of them, the moral cause I mean. And to be thus humbled, necessarily supposes that we have some just and right sense of the badness the vileness, and un∣reasonableness of the cause; or in other words, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we have a just sense of the vileness and ma∣lignity of sin or moral evil, as it is against God, as it counteracts his authority, as it is down-right rebellion against his crown and dignity, destruc∣tive of all regularity and order in the moral sys∣tem, naturally adapted to throw all things into confusion, to the dishonour of God, and thwart∣ing the designs of all his grand operations in the kingdom of providence and of grace. To be humbled before God under his mighty hand, supposes that we have a just and thorough sense, of all this. And so also the iniquity in all its
<PB N="17" REF="013388_0016_0F90F4AAEDFB1A58"/>
forms is most vile and base ingratitude against the divine being, who is the sourse of all good and felicity to communities as well as individuals, and upon whose powerful care and protection they absolutely are dependant for every future good. Such humiliation taking its rise from the considerations mentioned, carries in the idea of it, true genuine sorr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and mourning before God, grieved that we have acted so vile, so base, so irrational and unworthy a part: And at the same time solicitous to obtain forgiveness from him, applying earnestly, importunately and persevering∣ly to his throne of grace, for the obtainment of it, not for our sakes, but for his own name's sake, and for the sake of his Son Jesus, the great media∣tor and reconciler.</P>
<P>AND in close connexion with all this, and indeed as the natural result of all, there will be firm and hearty resolutions, through the divine aids, to abandon all those vicious practices that have been habitually indulged: That they will no more indulge to prophaneness, intemperance, unclean∣ness, stealing, making and propagating false re∣ports, wounding the character of their neighbours, over-reaching, defrauding, sabbath-breaking, dis∣obedience to parents, despising dignities, idling away their time to the neglecting their proper business, and making proper provision for their families and dependants, needlessly spending their time and money in public houses. And so I might mention other enormities. If we are hum∣ble under the mighty hand of God, we shall cease from all these evils, which have occasioned his
<PB N="18" REF="013388_0017_0F90950CDFDE9D78"/>
lifting it up against us. And we shall heartily be∣take ourselves to the practice of the opposite virtues. We shall practise upon the sacred rules laid down in the Bible: Be sober and temperate in all things, be chaste, be just, honest and righte∣ous; treat the characters and reputation of others with tenderness, and as true citizens of Zion, not take up a reproach against our neighbours. Children will obey their parents in the Lord, servants be obedient to their masters in all things, not purloining, but using all fidelity, regarding the holy sabbath and making a business of attend∣ing the sacred exercises thereof in God's sanctuary, maintaining family religion, statedly by offering up to God, morning and evening, the sacrifices of prayer and praise, rendering honor to whom honor is due. Submitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, as the apostle exhorts, and leading quiet and peaceable lives in all godli∣ness and honesty. If we are truely humbled under the mighty hand of God, such will be the re∣formation of manners among us, as the natural consequence of it. And if there is not such a reformation, we can't be said to be humbled un∣der God's mighty hand, nor may we expect to be exalted. This leads me to the 2<HI>d.</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad, but this, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h what remains I shall leave till the after∣noon.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1. Peter, v. 6.</BIBL>
<Q>We have considered <HI>the mighty hand of God,</HI> as intended of public distresses and calamitous events, brought on by his over-ruling provi∣dence. Also the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al, procuring cause here∣of, and the duty here exhorted to, <HI>Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.</HI></Q>

<P>I Go on now in the next place, to consider the probable happy consequence of complying with this duty. <HI>Humble yourselves &amp;c. that he may exalt you in due time.</HI> To be <HI>exalted</HI> here, may intend obtaining deliverance out of those evils and calamities, that God in his righteous anger has inflicted, and being restored to the state of ease and tranquility and outward prosperity and happi∣ness heretofore enjoyed.</P>
<P>It is natural to desire to be freed from evil and calamities, to be extricated out of public difficulties. And men are won't to be full of schemes and contrivances and most vigorous exer∣tions, that they may be so. But as there are such a variety of circumstances and events, that must concur in carrying them into execution, and as there are many circumstances unforeseen and un∣thought of, so they sometimes prove abortive. Men of the greatest penetration and sagacity have failed in their expectations and pursuits. In evil, and calamitous times, it is no doubt duty to con∣trive

and endeavour after deliverance, and plain incumbent duty ought to be done. But then, neither individuals nor collective bodies of men can command the event. This is beyond their power, it is very plain from the manner of expres∣sion in our text, that tho' it is our duty to humble ourselves under God's mighty hand, yet the event is wholly with God, and that he will take his own way and time in causing it to take place. That <HI>he</HI> may exalt you, when? You desire help and deliverance immediately, you think it best that it should be had without any delay. But if you are exalted or delivered, not only must God bring it about but he will take his own time for it. <HI>In due time,</HI> the time the infinite wisdom sees fittest and best.</P>
<P>AND now I would observe, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as God is infinite in goodness, and delighteth to do good to his creat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res, he never afflicts them willingly nor grieves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, so he is never backward to appear for their help and deliverance when they suitably and reverendly acknowledge him. As there is a moral cause for evils and calamities, which I have mentioned this day, even the sins and transgressions of a people, so upon the foundation of reason and scripture the removal of them may only be expected when this cause is removed. Or as we may thus express it. As the immoralities and vices of a people, causes God to lift up his mighty hand against them, and they are brought into great distress and perplexity, so as it is writ∣ten, <HI>righteousness exalteth a nation</HI> or people, repentance and reformation, and the practice of
<PB N="21" REF="013388_0020_0F90950ECD5521B8"/>
universal righteousness, is the most likely method to take in order to their being exalted, delivered from evils and restored to a state of ease, tranquili∣ty and public happiness. Yea, it is represented in scripture, that repentance and reformation, is the way to keep off divine calamities, such as a land lies exposed to, &amp; which seems to be hastening on, and to be continued in a prosperous &amp; happy state. And so on the other hand, the impenitence &amp; indulged moral evils, were preventive of the good &amp; felicity, which God thought to confer upon it. Hence we have that of the prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> xviii. 7, 8, 9, 10. <HI>At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it: If that nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil: I will repent of the evil I thought to do un∣to them. And at what instant I shall speak con∣cerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them.</HI></P>
<P>IF, when it seems as tho' God's mighty hand, was just ready to fall upon them, to distress them, &amp; ven ruin &amp; destroy them, if the nation or people take the alarm, (as one observes) &amp; repent of their sins, and reform their lives, turn every one from his evil way, and return to God, God will graci∣ously accept them, will not proceed in his con∣troversy, will return in mercy to them, and tho' he cannot change his mind, he will change his way, so as that it may be said, he repents him of the evil he said he would do to them. Thus of∣ten
<PB N="22" REF="013388_0021_0F90950F78AE6FE0"/>
in the time of the Judges, when the oppres∣sed people were penitent people, still God raised them up Saviours, and when they turned to God, their affairs presently took a new turn. And so if a nation or people whom God has loaded with benefits, do evil in his sight, and obey not his voice, if it lose its virtue, and become debauch'd and prophane, if religion grow into contempt, and vice get to be fashionable, and so be kept in countenance and reputation, and there be a gene∣ral decay of serious godliness among them, then God will turn his hand against them, will pluck up what he was planting, and pull down what he was building. What favours were further design∣ed shall be withheld. That God hurried Israel back into the wilderness, when he had brought them within sight of Canaan. Sin defeats Gods kind intentions concerning a people, baffles their pleasing expectations from him. It ruins their comforts, prolongs their grievances, brings them into straits, and retards their deliverance. <HI>Isaiah</HI> lix. 1, 2. <HI>Behold the Lord's hand is not shortned, that it cannot save: Neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN God was about destroying Nineveh, in which sin greatly abounded, when upon the warning given them of approaching d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>struction, they changed <HI>their</HI> way, God also changed <HI>his.</HI> They believed God, proclaimed a fast, put on all the external tokens of grief and penitence, and agreable to the exhortation of the King, no
<PB N="23" REF="013388_0022_0F909513469D8EC8"/>
doubt cried mightily to God, yea, turned every one from his evil way, and from the violence that was in his hand, and this upon a peradventure, not having an absolute certainty that God would appear for their deliverance. And accordingly it so happened <HI>God aw their works, that they turned rom their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto them, and he did it not.</HI> Jonah iii, last verse.</P>
<P>AND I would just observe here, that we shall find for the most part besu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, that the fasts that were observed under the old testament, were so on account of evils impending, or brought on, through the righteousanger of God for the abound∣ing wickednesses and immoralities in one place and in another.</P>
<P>THUS it was as to the fast at Nineveh, we just made mention of. And thus it was as to the fast observed in the days of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, <HI>Jeremiah</HI> 36, 9. <HI>And it came to pass in the fifth year of</HI> Jehoiakim <HI>&amp;c. That they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE occasion of that day of fasting we have in the 6, &amp; 7. verses. And so I might mention other in∣stances. It is plain from the instances mention'd, that they did not fast for strife or debate, or to smite with the fist of wickedness, they did not do so from any sinister views and designs, but they did so from the sense of the anger of God that was out a∣gainst them, for the evils and abominations they had committed in his sight. And this it is, such a sense of things as this, that only can give pro∣priety
<PB N="24" REF="013388_0023_0F909515C3604DB8"/>
to the observance of such days now as well as formerly. And when days of fasting are ob∣served after such a manner it is a token for good, that God has favours in store for the people.</P>
<P>WE have observed that God has sometimes averted impending evils, such as a sinful people have been imminently exposed to, and had the utmost reason to expect, when they have repented and returned to him, as was the case with Nine∣veh. And it may from hence be fairly argued, that he is ready to remove evils and calamities, which are already felt, when God beholds them humbled under his mighty hand, repenting and returning to him. The great end of public dis∣tresses and calamities, is the repentance and refor∣mation of the nation and land who are visited with them. And when this end is answered, may it not be expected that God will return to them in ways of favour and kindness, that he will de∣light to do them good with all his heart, to smile upon them in all their interests and concerns, and make them a prosperous happy people. As pub∣lic vices tend to draw down public calamities, so public vices and prevailing goodness tends to procure public blessings. So that to humble our∣selves under the mighty hand of God, is the most likely method to be exalted in due time, the time that infinite wisdom thinks best: The all-wise God knows better when to appear for the help of a humbled, penitent, reformed people, and to extricate them out of their troubles and perplexities, than they can prescribe to him. And when they have complied with his requirements
<PB N="25" REF="013388_0024_0F909516ECB25648"/>
it is their wisdom and their duty humbly to refer events to him, to order them out when and as he sees fittest and best. To be in the hands of in∣finite wisdom most certainly is to be in the best hands.</P>
<P>I shall only add here, what Moses in God's name says to the people of Israel, after pronounc∣ing a variety of blessings upon them, upon their approving themselves an obedient people. <HI>Deut.</HI> xxviii. from the 9th verse, to the 14. <HI>The Lord shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, if thou shall keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. And all the people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord, and they shall be afraid of thee. And the Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods. The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heavens to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: And thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow. And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I will no further enlarge here, but shall offer some things with plainness, and I trust with seri∣ousness, relative to the occasion of the day, and agreable to the subject I have been discoursing upon. It is I suppose universally acknowledged to be a day of great public distress and difficulty, so as that we know not well what to do, nor how to extricate ourselves.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="013388_0025_0F90951710DC5C48"/>
LET what will have been the instrumental or secondary causes, yet I trust, you have all of you this sense of things, that the great Governour of the world, in his over-ruling providence, has brought about such a state of things among us▪ Or why do we appear before God in his house this day, to spread our case before him, and to supplicate the kind interpositions of his providence towards us? Is not the language of this day's solemnity this, that we look upon it, that the mighty hand of God is lifted up against us? That he has a controversy with us? That we lie under his frowns and displeasure? If we have not such a sense of matters as this, it would be trifling with the di∣vine majesty, and indeed be a mockery of him, to come before him this day, in this manner. And as it is written, <HI>God will not be mocked.</HI> I should be loth to entertain an opinion of any one who has desired that such a day might be observed, that it was from a party-spirit, but would charitably hope, that it was to do honour to the great Governour of the world, religiously to acknowledge him as super-intend∣ing human affairs, and accordingly to supplicate the gracious and powerful interpositions of his pro∣vidence to relieve us from all our difficulties and distresses. And in this view of the case, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we are humbled under the mighty hand of God, and the solemnities of this day are followed with an universal repentance and reformation, we may hope that <HI>in due time</HI> God will exalt us, that he will relieve us of all our burdens and difficulties, and restore us to a state of prosperity and hap∣piness.
<PB N="27" REF="013388_0026_0F909517C77CD308"/>
Nor unless this is the case with us, may we upon any good and solid grounds, expect this. For as sin is a reproach to a people, so it has a tendency, both naturally, and morally, to destruc∣tion and ruin.</P>
<P>As to religion, that, which is pure and undefiled before God and the Father, perhaps there has been as great a proportion of this in New-England, as in any part of the christian world.</P>
<P>THE fathers of this land were actuated from this noble principle in forsaking their native country, and their many near and dear connexions and fair inheritances, and enterprising the settle∣ment of this howling wilderness. Religion ap∣peared in its true glory and lustre, in the early times of this country. There was a great regard to the holy scriptures, a great regard to the holy sabbaths and public worship: And they would go great distances willingly and chearfully, ra∣ther than be deprived of such precious advantages and privileges. There was a great regard to family worship, instruction and government, there was much of kindness, brotherly-love and charity in those puritanic times. And prophane cursing and swearing was a rare thing indeed, and many enormities and vicious practices, which have greatly obtained in modern times, were scarce∣ly known among them. I don't mean to represent that generation as absolutely perfect, for this is incompatible to the present state. Nevertheless they were very generally, a very excellent set of men. And their names and their memories, as they have been, so will be in future generations
<PB N="28" REF="013388_0027_0F9095188E41BFF0"/>
fragrant as the precious ointment. And the holy and righteous God own'd and honour'd them accordingly. That righteousness, which was so conspicuous among them, greatly exalted them. God was with them and for them, and who then could be against them? Verily none, and so it appeared, for by a variety of remarkable inter∣positions of his providence, God drove out the heathen before them, prepared room for them▪ and they prospered and increased under the smiles of heaven, and laid a broad foundation for those that come after them to build upon. And a grand and noble superstructure has been raised upon it, as we see at this day: And particularly since the conclusion of the last war, in which the country of <HI>Canada,</HI> that was so long a scourge to us, since, I say, that country has been subjected to the British empire, what a surprising spread and increase has there been to the English terri∣tories!</P>
<P>THE primitive, religious constitution of this country was very excellent, and under the smiles and blessing of the God of grace, has been abun∣dantly affectual to subserve the ends of vital piety, and godliness, and the purposes of redeeming grace. We have had excellent means of liberal education, through the pious care of our ancestors, our churches have greatly multiplied, and perhaps as great a proportion of able learned pious and faithful ministers of the gospel, as any part of the christian world can boast of. And such I doubt not they are at present, however lightly esteemed of by some, and however some may be disposed to distress
<PB N="29" REF="013388_0028_0F909519700A4760"/>
them and reduce them to penurious circumstances, to the great hindrance of the gospel, as well as damage to the common-wealth. For however regardless many may be of the gospel and the spiritual and everlasting blessings of it, yet it seems to be the general opinion that the christian minis∣try is an excellent institution, considered only in a civil and political light. And I would just say further here; that if it was wholly suppressed and banished the land, we should be in a situation not far superior to that of the aboriginal natives.</P>
<P>WE have had an excellent civil constitution, good and wholsome laws, the due execution of which, have produced the most salutary, and beneficial effects. At present, this people are thrown into great distress and perplexity thro' the operation of certain <HI>acts</HI> of the <HI>British</HI> legislature, imposing duties and taxes upon them, which, if the right it claims should be granted, yet must be looked upon by all, as contrary to the principles of sound policy, considering the intercourse be∣tween the Parent state and the Colonies, and the vast commercial interest maintained between them to their mutual benefit and advantage.</P>
<P>VERY sad is the present situation of our <HI>capital town,</HI> blocked up by a powerful squadron, to the cramping it's navigation and commerce, and to the impoverishment and distress of multitudes. And this distress that has befallen it, must have it's influence upon the whole community. If the <HI>head</HI> suffers, the <HI>members</HI> must in many respects suffer with it.—May God afford deliverance in due time, and give us occasion to rejoice in the
<PB N="30" REF="013388_0029_0F90951A00029FE0"/>
kind interpositions of his providence in removing this and every other difficulty and grievance! For we ought to bear this in mind, that our main de∣pendance in the case is upon his over-ruling pro∣vidence. We are not to trust in an arm of flesh, but in the Lord Jehovah, in whom is everlasting strength. Unto him are we to pray,—and unto him must we return,—that he may return in favour to us. <HI>Turn us again, O God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</HI> It is at present, as has been said, a time of great per∣plexity and distress. But are we to look altoge∣ther to the dark side of things? Is there no bright side to turn to? Yes verily, there is. Thus, it is a remarkable time of health throughout the land: We hear of no contagious, mortal sickness prevail∣ing any where: We have not this season been visited with scorching droughts, with devouring insects. We have had the refreshing rains and shines of heaven, and the fruits of the earth necessary for the support of man and beasts, were perhaps never in a more flourishing state, nor a better prospect of a plentiful increase.</P>
<P>WE yet enjoy our quiet sabbaths, and christian institutions, the day and the means of grace. And so I might mention many other favours and blessings of heaven. So that notwithstanding all our difficulties and grievances, yet our state is not absolutely forlorn and desperate. We have a bright side to look to, and ought to look to it; we have great reason for thankfulness to the great Governour of the world, at the same time that we have much cause for humiliation before him
<PB N="31" REF="013388_0030_0F90951E46326918"/>
considering the moral grounds and reasons of this controversy with us.</P>
<P>WE are desirous of being extricated out of all our difficulties, and enjoying public good and happiness of every kind. Now the subject I have been discoursing upon, directs us to the most effectual method to betake ourselves to, in order to this. The way to be exalted, is to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. All schemes and plans that may be laid, all endeavours that may be used, are not of that importance, nor will they be likely to be so efficacious, as secur∣ing the friendship, the guardian-ship and pro∣tection of the God of heaven, who has all events and all hearts in his hands, and who can in the most surprizing, unexpected manner, scatter dark clouds, change the face of things, bring good out of evil, and open a fair, bright and refresh∣ing scene, turn our mourning into dancing, put off our sackcloth and gird us with gladness. O! what a great thing is it, to have the omnipotent God engage on the side of a people! Every thing then must go well with them in spite of all ob∣structions and oppositions. For <HI>there is no wis∣dom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord.</HI> Prov 21, 30.</P>
<P>THERE is none that can avail any thing any more than for a worm to pretend to cope with a Lion.</P>
<P>BUT in order that we may enjoy the friendship of God and be under his smiles and blessings, we must on our part be in friendship with him. And then only are we so, when we are brought
<PB N="32" REF="013388_0031_0F9095209E54C928"/>
to that repentance and reformation that we have spoken of this day. This verily is of very great importance in regard of God's glory, and as we would consult our own good and prosperity even at present. O that there were such an heart in us all, and in this whole people, that we may humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt us in due time. If vice and wickedness, especially in all its grosser forms was suppressed, and piety and virtue, righteousness, temperance, charity &amp;c. were generally to pre∣vail in the midst of us, what a token for good would this be! We might then securely depend upon God's kind care and protection, and that his blessing would be upon us in all regards. But now, instead of the prevalence of these duties and virtues, is it not too evident, that we are <HI>a people laden'd with iniquity,</HI> notwithstanding all the goodness of God that he has manifested to us, and notwithstanding all his frowns and dis∣pleasure, which by our iniquities we have pro∣cured?</P>
<P>CAN it be said that the troubles, perplexities and difficulties of the present day have produced a general repentance and reformation of manners? May it not be truly said, that the lusts and cor∣ruptions of many have greatly and unhappily o∣perated, which instead of diminishing have very much increased our troubles! What jealousies and resentments have been entertained among old friends, neighbours and relatives? What hard and opprobrious names have been given to one another! What a disposition to raise
<PB N="33" REF="013388_0032_0F909520C1BD9268"/>
and propagate false reports without regarding the mischievous consequences of them! Yea, what wrath and malice, bitterness, clamour and evil∣speaking has there been! How much horrible prophaness and impiety has there been, to the dishonour of God, to the eating out the very vitals of religion, the religion of the blessed Jesus, which breaths a quite different spirit, and tending also to the destruction of the very form of it.</P>
<P>SUCH evils as these, alas! how greatly prevalent have they been in these days, in which the mighty hand of God has been lifted up against us! Nor is his anger turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. It is far from being agreable to me, in itself considered, to enumerate the evils of the times, but I should not be faithful if I did not. And all who are themselves conscientious, must approve of faithfulness in others.</P>
<P>I WOULD now offer a few things by way of counsel, hoping they will be received and prac∣tically regarded.</P>
<P>In the first place, let every one search and try his own heart and ways, humble himself before God, implore forgiveness through Christ, and grace for the future, to live in a holy, obedient manner. If it should be thus with every one, then reformation would be general And in this case we might hope to be highly exalted.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>LET it be the care of every one to get possessed of a spirit of charity and brotherly kindness. This is of very great importance to the comfort and well∣being of societies, both the greater and the less.
<PB N="34" REF="013388_0033_0F909521E0F9B238"/>
For where there is contention, there is confusion and every evil work. In almost all matters, civil, secular and religious, a diversity of sentiments takes place amongst mankind. It is in vain to expect, that in all things they will be of the same mind and of the same judgment. And therefore a great deal of forbearance, candour, condescension, meekness and charity is necessary. Persons may and ought to be good neighbours and friends, and to treat one another as brethren, however they may be of different opinions from one another in many matters.</P>
<P>BROTHERLY kindness and charity, as it is a great christian duty, so it is the beauty, strength and glory of societies. It tends greatly to alle∣viate burdens and to sweeten life. I shall only just add her, the fine and beautiful description of charity in the 1<HI>st</HI> epistle to the <HI>Corinth</HI> 13<HI>th</HI> chap. 4. 8. <HI>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth: Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER thing I would mention, relative to the observation of this day. Some may not see their way clear to observe it, it not being enjoin'd in the usual way.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>The observation of this day was not, as usual, by a pro∣clamation from the civil authority. It appears that the late House of Representatives applied to his Excellency Governor GAGE that a public fast might be appointed. But at his Excellency was not pleased to comply with said motion; it was voted in the house, that the Representatives upon their return home, apply to their respective Parish Ministers that such a day might be observed. Having been applied to according∣ly, and finding upon laying it before the congregation in this place, which I th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'t but a just respect to them notwithstanding said application, and perceiving that it was very generally de∣sired, the day was observed. And I have the pleasure to declare that there was not the least disorder upon said day. Many re∣spectable persons who did not see so clearly into the propriety of it, yet being unwilling to give offence to their neighbours and brethren, laid aside all their secular concerns, and with but few exceptions attended the public exercises. And I would fur∣ther declare, that so far as I had opportunity to observe among my people, the principle that seemed to govern them, was not an opposition to government, but from a sense they professed to have of the frowns of heaven upon us, and the propriety of imploring God's gracious and powerful interposition.</HI></NOTE> Now as no one is under
<PB N="35" REF="013388_0034_0F90952242BFB088"/>
any compulsion in the case, so I would earnestly advise that there may be no hard and severe re∣flections cast upon any, and that there be no uncivil, indecent conduct towards any upon the occasion. Let there be nothing inconsistent with the character of men and christians. This will doubtless be productive of the most salutary and comfortable effects. Again,</P>
<P>WITH respect to those that have been desirous of the observation of this day, (and this seems to be very general) I would say that you ought to regard it as unto the Lord. Do not you hereby profess to do honour to the great Governor of the world, to express your unworthiness before him, your dependance upon him, to acknowledge and bewail your sins which have occasioned him to lift up his mighty hand, and to bring us into difficulties and distresses, to implore his forgive∣ness and the return of his favour. Those that
<PB N="36" REF="013388_0035_0F9095230C55A378"/>
are sincere and hearty in all this, may upon good grounds hope and expect that God will accept them therein. You mean the solemnity of this day, bre∣thren! or the attendance upon it, as an act of re∣ligion. Now won't you all of you carry the religion of this day into your families? Won't you con∣sider it as your duty, besides joining in the pub∣lick prayers of the sanctuary, to offer up your prayers and supplications to the divine majesty in your houses, for those favours and blessings from him that are peculiarly needed in the present day, and which we have publickly spread before God? Or does this day's observance compleat the whole affair?</P>
<P>MAY it not justly be expected by God himself that a genuine repentance and reformation will follow this days solemnity? shall it be said that any after this go on in prophaness, intempe∣rance, unchastity, in fraud and oppression, in bit∣terness, wrath, malice, anger, dishonesty, un∣righteousness, sabbath breaking, neglecting the public worship of God? Shall it be said after this, that there are any more prayerless families, that live like heathens, not calling upon the name of the Lord? I must speak freely and faithfully here, that I fear that there are a great many pray∣erless families among you, and I must earnestly expostulate with you upon this head. Why will you thus live without God in the world? Are you afraid or ashamed to acknowledge your Maker and daily benefactor? Can you live with∣out him, live independant on him? You surely will not acknowledge this, unless your are pro∣fessed
<PB N="37" REF="013388_0036_0F909523C8BE9620"/>
Atheists. But I am well perswaded that none of you are of this abandoned class of mor∣tals. You acknowledge, all of you, I presume that there is a God, and that you are absolutely dependant upon him for public, personal and family blessings. And will you not then erect an altar for him in your houses, whereon to offer religious sacrifices daily, morning and evening? How can you expect the blessing of God upon your persons or families, if you neglect having any concern with him in the way I have now mentioned? I must earnestly exhort such as have hitherto neglected family worship, that they im∣mediately set it up, and not to make a bye business of it, but constantly to attend it. Consider what you owe to your children. They are committed to your care not only to provide for their outward welfare and comfort, but to train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. And is it likely that they will have any sense of God or religion if they see their parents live in the neglect of such a plain incumbent duty, as that of family-worship is? And will no religion, the most important thing in the world, be lost among the rising generation if you go on in such a neglect? I hope what I have now said upon this matter will be seriously laid to heart by those of you to whom it is especially applicable. And may it please God to render it effectual to bring about a reformation in this matter! And I would just add in a word, that it will ill become those to live in the neglect of family-worship, who have discovered a zeal, that this day of fasting
<PB N="38" REF="013388_0037_0F90F4ADEBCAD4A8"/>
and prayer be observed on account of our public difficulties.</P>
<P>I SHALL now close all with briefly saying. That while you are in such anxiety respecting your civil liberties, it infinitely concerns you, that you be in earnest that you may have a share in the glorious liberties and privileges of the children of God. Civil liberty it is acknowledged is a most valuable enjoyment. And what all are earnestly desirous of the enjoyment of. And as every one is desi∣rous of it for himself, so every one ought to be willing that his neighbour should enjoy it. But is it acting a consistent part to vilisy and reproach others, because they take that liberty which God and nature have given them to think and speak differently from them? No one can soberly pre∣tend this. No doubt all aim at the same thing, whatever difference there may be in opinion and conduct. Let us remember, Brethren! That the present scene will quickly be closed upon us. And we shall have no more any concern with the affairs, and transactions of the present state. And if we get to heaven, as God in his in∣finite mercy thro' Christ grant we all may, we shall there be all of one heart and soul There harmony, love and peace will universally take place. There we shall enjoy liberty of the right sort, be eternally free from the bondage of Satan and our own corruptions, and all the penal effects of them, and love God, and love one another en∣tirely and sincerely, and with the utmost freedom and chearfulness, serve and glorify God and the Lamb throughout eternal ages.</P>
