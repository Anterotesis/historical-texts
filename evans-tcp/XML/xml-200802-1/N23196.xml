<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN &amp; FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR assembling at this time, and place, speaks the occasion import∣ant—Among other designs of a more usual nature one principal object, is, to record the name of Jehovah in this House, which has lately, been erected for his praise. <HI>And now, for the first time,</HI> we are called upon to enkindle upon <HI>this Altar,</HI> through the aids of the holy Spirit, those holy and devout af∣fections towards GOD, which may reach his throne as sweet incense perfumed in the Blood of the Lamb. And how happy should we be, were these affections, we are now to offer, a prelude to our standing in the pre∣sence of GOD above, and joining with the heavenly hosts, and all the redeemed, in their more pure, and eternal effusions of love, adoration and praise. But while we present our sacrifice here, we are to offer to
<PB N="4" REF="030663_0003_0FE854F6AC179900"/>
GOD, our devout acknowledgments—as for all his other mercies, so in particular for this—the gift of so convenient an edifice, which of his own free bounty and provi∣dence he has enabled us to accomplish—And finally, We are here to leave our vows with GOD—that we avouch the Lord Jehovah for our GOD, confessing our entire dependence upon him, for all the present temporal and spiritual favors we enjoy—and all which we hope for, in the world to come.</P>
<P>That we may perform these exercises, in a becoming manner, may the Holy Spirit, who dwelt in the temple of old, descend in∣to every heart, <HI>enlighten, guide, and direct us,</HI> that at the close of this service, and the close of life, we may find to draw near to GOD is good, and that his loving kindness is better than life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</P>
<P>To assist in the duties before us—the words of the <HI>Psalmist: Psalm</HI> cxlv. <HI>at the</HI> 7<HI>th</HI>—are chosen.</P>
<P><HI>They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness.</HI></P>
<P>WE find that this inspired Penman, opens his most excellent Hymn, with the sense which he had of the divine Majesty, <HI>wond∣erous works, and greatness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030663_0004_0FE854FA93B08AE8"/><HI>I will extol thee, my</HI> GOD, <HI>O King, and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.—Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever, and ever.—Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.</HI>—He then gratified the feel∣ings of his heart, in contemplating the unceasing praises of his GOD, by after gen∣erations—<HI>One generation</HI> (said he) <HI>shall praise thy works unto another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.—They shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts.</HI>—And then he introduced the words of the text, <HI>They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy right∣eousness.</HI> He then proceeded to mention the subjects of gratitude which rushed into his mind, which in their number and extent, were almost boundless—But in the particular words which are selected for our present im∣provement, are noticeable the following things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the goodness of GOD is very great towards his people—<HI>Thy great goodness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the instances of GOD's goodness are treasured up in their memories—<HI>The memory of thy great goodness.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That the people of GOD feel an ardent disposition to dwell upon, and rehearse over
<PB N="6" REF="030663_0005_0FE85501DF3B5898" MS="y"/>
the instances of GOD's great mercy and kind∣ness—<HI>They shall abundantly utter the mem∣ory of thy great goodness</HI>—and</P>
<P N="4">4. This is according to the will of GOD—<HI>They shall</HI> do thus—The words im∣ply, not merely, a prediction of what would be, but the pleasure of GOD in it, that they should do thus, in a way of duty, and grate∣ful praise—agreeably to the close of the Psalm, <HI>My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord—and let all flesh, bless his holy name, forever, and ever.</HI></P>
<P>It appears therefore to be the duty of GOD's people, <HI>to utter abundantly</HI> the me∣mory of his great goodness towards them.</P>
<P>From these hints, it is proposed to com∣prise no more in the following discourse than may be included in this general Enqui∣ry in two parts (viz.)</P>
<P>Wherein is the great goodness of GOD manifested towards us, as a nation in gene∣ral, and an individual society—</P>
<P>From which, in the conclusion will be in∣duced the duties of this day.</P>
<P N="1">1st. Then, our subject leads us to en∣quire, in what instance the goodness of GOD is manifested to be great towards us as a nation—</P>
<P>IN a field so wide where can we with pro∣priety begin or end?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030663_0006_0FE855036D08E670"/>The blessings which we have experienced, and still enjoy, come nearer within the pow∣er of a speaker to enumerate, than illustrate.</P>
<P>Shall we in the</P>
<P N="1">1st. Place look back to the protection and blessings of GOD's hand which <HI>rested on the Fathers, the first settlers of this country?</HI> The page of history is <HI>here replete,</HI> in re∣counting the hardships—sufferings and death which many of them endured: but withal, recounting an overbalancing sum of almost miraculous divine interpositions and salva∣tions—from hunger—beasts of prey, and an host of men, more savage if possible, than the wolf of the wilderness—While the Eu∣ropean world persecuted the <HI>Woman,</HI> the pure church of Christ, and wasted its mem∣bers by cruelty—outrage and death.—A few of them sought an <HI>asylum</HI> on these shores— GOD was with them and gave them success— He established them as a people, and from them he has reared up his American Israel— Could we view the footsteps of divine provi∣dence in the gradual settlement and growth of this country up to the commencement of our independence, what an infinite variety of distinguishing blessings would arrest our attention? The good providence of GOD, has ordered the seasons—over-ruled and suc∣ceeded the exertions of every class of men, for the public prosperity of this people in a worldly view—Shall we again,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="030663_0007_0FE8550A22FED8D8"/>2dly. Take a glance at the great goodness of GOD in carrying this people through the struggles of a civil war with Britain—When oppressed and doomed to slavery, we assert∣ed our independence and GOD was pleased to establish it—But who can count the bles∣sings, and almost miraculous interpositions of GOD's hand in this affair—In the view of man our cause appeared gloomy—<HI>to many despe∣rate.</HI>—Without money, without warlike im∣plements—without disciplined troops we en∣gaged—On their side was power of every human kind.—But as an answer <HI>for all our weakness,</HI> and for <HI>all their strength,</HI> The Lord was on our side—The language of the people of GOD is put into our lips—<HI>If it had not been, the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say—Had it not been the Lord, who was on our side when men rose up against us—Then they had swallowed us up quick— when their wrath was kindled against us—then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul—Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth— Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the Fowler: the snare is broken, and we are escaped; Our help is in the name of the Lord who made Heaven and Earth.</HI>—His mighty acts—his terrible acts, were made known in the judgment inflicted on our foes, and <HI>his
<PB N="9" REF="030663_0008_0FE8550BB10D3870"/>
great goodness</HI> manifested towards us as a people—</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Shall we again take but a cursory view of GOD's goodness towards us since the conclu∣sion of peace—As a nation, how greatly blessed have we been in the formation, adoption, and establishment of a Federal Government—The good hand of GOD, formed men for council, and wisdom, brought them forward as the Fathers of the people, and guided them to unite the interest of individuals, with the good of the whole, in the formation of our general constitution.</P>
<P>Through the guidance of God's good pro∣vidence, this constitution, has gone into the most benign operation, without the loss of any man's life, and made us, in respect to our civil privileges, one of the happiest people on the Globe.</P>
<P>To awaken in us a sense of GOD's great goodness in this particular, we need only turn our eyes, across the Atlantic, and be∣hold the anarchy, rage of party, and flowing blood of an allied nation: What could have rescued us, from the horrors they experience, but that same good providence which has <HI>nourished and brought us up as children</HI>—But whose heart is not smitten, and whose eyes do not <HI>gush with tears,</HI> to hear of the scenes
<PB N="10" REF="030663_0009_0FE855119D72C9B0"/>
of woe and blood, transacted in the capital of France, and her other great cities, through means of civil discord. These scenes by contrast may ever teach us, the distinguishing goodness of GOD towards us, and make us prize our liberties and civil blessings.</P>
<P>As to our increase in population and wealth, what nation has exceeded us? In the year 1783, at the conclusion of peace, the number of inhabitants in the United States were computed at 2, 389, 300—The last year they were computed upon a pretty accurate scale of calculation, taken from the Census of 1791, and the number was found to be 4, 784, 983—which makes an increase since the war, of 2, 395, 683—which is some thou∣sands more than double. Our internal wealth likewise has had a rapid increase— Our shores are lined with ships—Our com∣merce is large and extensive—and for this two years, been greatly enriching to the country. Our Lands yield their increase by handfuls, through the blessings of GOD on the labors of the husbandman. Our country <HI>does much</HI> in feeding the Islands of the sea, and even many on the eastern continent. Our granaries are full; affording all manner of store. The present year in a special man∣ner, the earth has afforded us, rich and liber∣al supplies of every necessary and valuable
<PB N="11" REF="030663_0010_0FE85514753DB708"/>
fruit—<HI>The ways of</HI> God <HI>drop marrow and fatness to us</HI>—Although in some instances loss has been experienced, still the blessings of GOD have been so abundant in general, that even the appearance of complaint would be criminal.</P>
<P>In addition to these instances of GOD's great goodness towards us, as a people, we have to notice the continuation of the im∣portant life of our chief Magistrate, The President of the United States—Many things in the peace, order, and happiness of our country have seemed to depend much upon his wise and energetic management—And none can foresee, what a righteous provi∣dence may suffer to take place when he falls. Our confidence ought to be in GOD, who is able to form another of equal wisdom to fill his place—<HI>The lives</HI> also of most of our chief Rulers have been continued.</P>
<P>We are to notice likewise the continuation of general health. Although some places have been visited with sickness, the people in general have had occasion to rejoice in GOD, <HI>their Preserver.</HI> We might still go on to e∣numerate mercies, such as the peace with the natives on our frontiers—The suppression of tumults—The peace likewise with the regent of Algiers—The treaty with Great-Bri∣tain—The blessings of GOD in societies and families: but where would the growing
<PB N="12" REF="030663_0011_0FE8551B79D9DC38"/>
numbers end? These hints must suffice to bring into view GOD's great goodness to∣wards us, as a nation, in a <HI>temporal view.</HI></P>
<P>And shall we in the</P>
<P>4th And last place, hint at our religious privileges—their nature, and importance? But who can speak of the instances of GOD's goodness in these?—A theme like this would be exposed in the hands of an angel—How much more in the hands of a potters vessel! —<HI>But</HI> let us just observe; the word of the ever blessed GOD, <HI>is in our hands.</HI> It is giv∣en in our own language, and we have abun∣dant time, and opportunity to peruse it—No religious tyranny pretends to interfere, to deprive us of any part of this inestimable treasure—No inquisition usurps the authority, of giving <HI>law</HI> to conscience; or disturbs our religious exercises—<HI>more still,</HI> we have no religion established by civil Iaw, or one man permitted to domineer over the conscience of another—But every one is protected in his devotion by the civil arm, and not per∣mitted to disturb his neighbor.</P>
<P>One day in seven is immediately assigned for the worship of GOD. This day, as yet, is reverenced more generally, by the people of these States, than in any other country— though in many cases as a christian people, we ought to feel the depth of shame, <HI>yea, horror,</HI> at our profanation of it—Still, the
<PB N="13" REF="030663_0012_0FE8551D0CD45510"/>
Lord is good—He makes it a day beyond conception better, than is enjoyed in most countries. In addition to this, how highly favored are we, in the enjoyment of religious information. The Sun of righteousness has blessed us with the richest supply of his cheering beams. How full is our land of the judicious labors of pious men. The truths of GOD's word, <HI>the law and gospel,</HI> are made to shine all around us. No time perhaps can be pointed out, when a people have enjoyed a set of teachers more sincere, enlightened, and evangelical than the present.—We have line upon line given us, and are urged to duty and happiness, by infinite motives from rea∣son and the word of GOD—These privileges shew <HI>the great</HI> and distinguishing goodness of GOD towards us: But when we come to view properly, the nature and importance of the law and gospel of GOD, as they respect our ru∣ined race—and the blessings to be enjoyed in the kingdom of the Redeemer; <HI>we are</HI> com∣pletely swallowed up with the prospect.</P>
<P><HI>Man by nature is a rebel against his</HI> GOD— By turning enemy to him, he has imbibed the Spirit; and has the black character of his Se∣ducer. By this revolt, the whole race of men are sentenced, by the holy, just, and good law of GOD, to death temporal, spiritual, and e∣ternal—They all lie under this just and aw∣ful sentence—But in the infinite compassion
<PB N="14" REF="030663_0013_0FE855241AE7A260"/>
of GOD, he sent his only begotten Son, that whosoever should believe in him should not perish, but should have eternal life. The gospel is this good news of life to a perishing world—Christ Jesus has actually come, ful∣filled the law—died on the cross—lay in the tomb—and rose again the third day—as∣cended to Heaven, <HI>and sent down gifts for men, even for the rebellious, that</HI> GOD <HI>might dwell among them.</HI>—The <HI>plan</HI> of the gospel is such, that while it pro∣vides the way, it invites, intreats, and beseeches perishing mortals, to repent and live—It is the voice of the ever blessed GOD to men, <HI>Turn ye, turn ye,</HI> for why <HI>will ye die;</HI> O miserable sinners▪ <HI>Ho every one that thirsteth, come ye to the wa∣ters—and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</HI> How great, how infinite is God's goodness towards us in these offers of grace!—When it is consid∣ered what is our moral character by nature —When it is realized, we have immortal <HI>souls</HI> of vast capacity—and of inestimable value, which if they continue as they are, must be cast into Hell, <HI>where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched</HI>—and when it is considered, what GOD has done for our Salvation, and now is offering us freely the gift of eternal life—the mind is lost in ad∣miration!
<PB N="15" REF="030663_0014_0FE85525AAE55A90"/>
<HI>No wonder the Angels desire to look into these misteries</HI> of GOD's goodness. Realize further, that it is the whole business of the Heralds of Salvation, to persuade us to be reconciled to GOD—and to set forth all the arguments which an eternal paradise can furnish, to sweeten the persuasion—and on the other hand, all the terrors of eternal perdition, to enforce the reconciliation: and when it is considered, that GOD sends these for our own benefit—how great is his good∣ness? But we cannot enlarge here, eternity only will be sufficient, fully to contemplate this grace.</P>
<P>Again—GOD is infinitely good to us, in a spiritual view—not only in offering mercy, but in absolutely giving power to his blessed gospel, and saving a multitude of precious souls from destruction. The church of Christ is spread through our land—There are a multitude, we have reason to think, of vital christians in the midst of us, who are born of GOD—who have eternal life begun in their souls—and who have publicly and sincerely, dedicated themselves to Christ, We have reason to think there are more of this description in these States, than on any spot of equal extent on the globe—The Lord's people are here scattered among the multitude, as the salt of the earth—
<PB N="16" REF="030663_0015_0FE8552CE1BE0020"/>
the church is as a city set on an hill—and is the moral light of our land, and nation.</P>
<P>In this blessed kingdom of the Redeemer, how many and rich are our privileges? time and eternity will not exhaust their illustra∣tion—We cannot forbear to mention a few.</P>
<P>Here GOD himself dwells in this spiri∣tual house, and holds communion with all who are his people—Says the Apostle to his brethren, <HI>Ye are no more strangers, and foreigners, but are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the house-hold of</HI> GOD—<HI>and are built upon the foundation, of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord—In whom ye also, are build∣ed together for an habitation of</HI> GOD, <HI>through the Spirit</HI>—Here, GOD himself dwells in his habitation—Here <HI>Christ walks amidst his gold∣en candlesticks, and holds his stars in his right hand</HI>—and says in the language of his own Spirit, <HI>This is my rest forever, here will I dwell for I have desired it: and he loveth the gates of</HI> (this) <HI>Zion, more than all the dwel∣lings of Jacob</HI>—Now, the privilege of meeting Christ and enjoying the manifesta∣tations which he makes of himself to his dis∣ciples, are esteemed by them, of infinitely greater value than all things beside. Here, all the people of GOD, <HI>see him;</HI> and to behold
<PB N="17" REF="030663_0016_0FE8552E6F8FBC48"/>
<HI>the King of Glory in his beauty,</HI> is pleasant be∣yond description—Said the Psalmist, <HI>O</HI> GOD <HI>my soul thirsteth for thee—my flesh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirsty land where no water is—to see thy power, and thy glory, so as I have seen them in the sanctuary</HI>—A sight of the glory and power of GOD, in his spiritual hab∣itation, is so ravishing to the hearts of GOD's people, as hides the lustre of all o∣ther objects—The communion also; which they hold with their GOD, is pleasant—<HI>Thy loving kindness</HI> says one, <HI>is better than life.</HI> To pour out the heart before him, and re∣ceive the communications of his grace, makes the communion blessed.</P>
<P><HI>Out of this Zion</HI> also, <HI>the perfection of beauty,</HI> GOD <HI>shines</HI> by his truth, and illuminates every pious soul: <HI>Here</HI> the wonders of redeeming love, refresh them continually, and cause their souls to burn within them, as the disciples go∣ing to Emmaus. Here likewise, they find ev∣ery needful word, of instruction and comfort. Says the Holy Ghost, speaking of the church, <HI>I will abundantly bless her provision, and I will fill her poor with bread: I will also clothe her priests with Salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy</HI>—How great is this privi∣lege of divine light, instruction, and comfort?</P>
<P>Here also, in this household of GOD, Christ seals his covenant with his people, by
<PB N="18" REF="030663_0017_0FE85536536ACB70"/>
his sacraments. By these outward solemn transactions, between GOD and their souls, they grow confirmed in the precious bles∣sings of the gospel, and live upon the <HI>hidden manna.</HI> They nourish their spiritual life, by that bread, which came down from Heaven; which gives life to all who partake of it. Indeed the divine satisfaction, of sup∣ping with Christ, and he with them, is a most glorious anticipation of the Heavenly felici∣ty—those who have never tasted this com∣munion cannot judge of its privilege.</P>
<P>In the light of this dwelling of GOD, souls are also, <HI>created anew,</HI> in the image of him that created them—Says the Holy Spirit—<HI>Of Zion it shall be said, that this and that man, were born in her—and when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there</HI>— How unspeakable is this privilege, as a glo∣rious mean, of bringing lost souls to life, and the eternal enjoyment of their GOD and Sa∣viour? In view of these spiritual privileges, en∣joyed in the blessed kingdom of the Redeem∣er, we cannot but see, that here is the place where the people of GOD on earth, hold the greatest communion, with the saints a∣bove. In these sacred ordinances, Heaven and Earth are united. Christ and his peo∣ple are united, and the latter are here made <HI>meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light</HI>—This doubtless made the
<PB N="19" REF="030663_0018_0FE85537E14044A0"/>
Psalmist express himself with exultation and say—<HI>Blessed are they that dwell in thy house— Blessed is the man, whose strength is in thee, they go from strength to strength, every one in Zion appeareth before thee—A day spent in thy house, is better than a thousand—I had rather be a door-keeper, in the house of my</HI> GOD, <HI>than to dwell in the tents of wicked∣ness</HI>—Now, of these divine blessings, <HI>all</HI> who are the people of GOD, partake in great perfection—and multitudes of our fathers, mothers, brethren and sisters, friends and relatives, are doubtless preparing for eter∣nal felicity in Heayen. But it is likewise ob∣vious that the perfection of these social bles∣sings, in the kingdom of Christ, could not be enjoyed, without the accommodation, of external temples made with hands: In dif∣ferent ages of the church therefore, GOD has directed his people, <HI>To build him Sanctu∣aries, that he might dwell among them,</HI> and confer upon them these infinite blessings. He has promised <HI>that in every place</HI> (or tem∣ple) <HI>where I record my name, I will come un∣to thee and bless thee.</HI> In this respect finally, as a christian people, we are al∣most universally accommodated and bles∣sed—<HI>How manifold are</HI> GOD's <HI>mercies?</HI> But as this external accommodation, has been provided for us particularly, the present year, and as the good providence
<PB N="20" REF="030663_0019_0FE8553D177EA218"/>
of GOD, has assembled us here, in his <HI>sanc∣tary which is now dedicated to his worship,</HI> on this anniversary festival—With great propriety as we hinted in the beginning, we may contemplate GOD's great goodness to∣wards us, as a society <HI>in this single particular.</HI></P>
<P>But at what period shall we begin? Our minds are naturally carried back, to that desolating scene in which our former house was laid in ruins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Nov. 26 1793—A fire broke out in a store in this city, owned by Messrs. Hubbards &amp; Greene, about six in the evening— and burnt with much fury. It continued to encrease, baffling all efforts to suppress it, till it had con∣sumed fifteen buildings, among which was the Meeting House—Through a kind Providence, the wind suddenly shifting carried the flames back from its first course—and by the vigorous exertions of the citizens, were suppressed. No lives were lost. The loss of property in the whole was estimated from eight to ten thousand pounds.</NOTE>—The frown of GOD, lay upon us for that moment; many of us have felt the rebuke, till this hour—the judg∣ment was terrible, though mingled with mer∣cy. Our feelings as a society, received a sensible check, in respect to our worldly prospects—but did not sink. The Lord was kinder to us than we deserved, and spared the most of our dwellings from the flames. Soon the cloud of GOD's displeasure, began to <HI>dissipate,</HI> the first meeting which was cal∣led, for the purpose of rebuilding an house of worship, evidenced the good hand of
<PB N="21" REF="030663_0020_0FE85541252E3428"/>
GOD towards us. The union, prudence, and mutual kindness, which appeared was singular. All as one, expressed their wishes to attempt the execution of so important a design; and leave to the decisions of provi∣dence, whether <HI>means</HI> could be obtained by gratuity, for the accomplishment of it. As is was the Lord who put it into the hearts of the people of old, to give for the building of the temple; subscriptions for this purpose, far surpassed our expectations. The attempt likewise to raise supplies from our neigh∣boring friends by lot, succeeded <HI>perfectly</HI>—beyond what might justly be expected, especially in the case of those donations which were generously given <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These were by Thomas Shaw Esq. of New-London, 262 Dollars, and Col. Joseph Williams of Norwich, 131 Dollars. Being their shares in the highest Prize in the Lottery.</NOTE> and every successive attempt has been prosperous.</P>
<P>We are next to notice that the goodness of GOD has appeared great—in the procuring the materials—the location of the house— the hazard of rearing of it up, and the labo∣rious task of finishing. These have been ac∣complished with dispatch—without any ca∣lamitous events, such as wounds—divisions or unfriendly feelings on any side, which events frequently happen, as a sore evil, and
<PB N="22" REF="030663_0021_0FE85548E8061418"/>
greatly to be lamented. And now, the bles∣sing of GOD, has crowned our wishes, in the complete enjoyment of this convenient and pleasant sanctuary.</P>
<P>You will suffer me therefore in the con∣clusion of this discourse just to hint, the du∣ties to which we are called this day—and</P>
<P N="1">1st. It becomes us to treasure up in our memories, these various instances of GOD's goodness towards us, as <HI>a people,</HI> and as a so∣ciety—To forget the loving kindnesses of GOD, as soon as experienced is ungrateful— it argues the basest unchristian temper—one which a grateful people must abhor.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. As the people of GOD, we are called upon this day to express the grateful feel∣ings of our hearts, in <HI>uttering</HI> abundantly the memory of his great goodness towards us. We are to acknowledge GOD in all his kindnesses—we are to speak and rehearse over his mercies, which our memories have treasured up—We are to meditate and talk of his mighty acts, which he hath done for our fathers and country in general—and show forth his praise in public, and private. Particularly we are to praise GOD for his goodness towards us the current year, in our temporal interests—that he has blessed us in general, in our basket and store—that he has so far preserved our health, and dwellings from destructive judgments: But

especially we are to praise GOD this day for his goodness in blessing our exertions to∣wards his kingdom and cause, and for giving us this his temple—that he has given to the people of this place, such union, and harmo∣ny from the first to the present—that he has given so much wisdom and prudence in all our deliberations from time to time, as to create no discord—we are to praise him likewise for all his goodness in the various steps, by which it has been accomplished, even from the foundation. And in praising GOD for his mercies in this respect, we are to thank those public servants who have given their time and attention to the oversight and direction of the work; and those also who have deserved well in the manual performance of it. <HI>But</HI> above all we are to praise GOD, for those divine and bles∣sed privileges to which by this <HI>sacred altar</HI> we are admitted—Here my Friends, do we not hope to meet in an humble, devout, and joyful manner, the Great GOD himself, and yield up our souls to him? Do we not hope to hold communion with the Father and with his son Jesus Christ upon our soul's eternal concerns? Do we not hope to receive the blessed light of the gospel, and be sanctified by the truth—and the divine influences of the holy spirit? Do we not hope to sit around the sacred board, and seal our covenant with

GOD, by eating and drinking the cymbals of the death of our Divine Jesus? Do we not expect to be refreshed with the bread, which wisdom has prepared, and the wine she hath mingled?—And finally do we not expect in the use of these privileges, to hold intercourse with the heavenly word? Nay, do we not hope to be prepared for death; and to stand before GOD in his temple above, and sing his praises eternally?—<HI>O, then,</HI> if you entertain these hopes <HI>as the people of</HI> GOD, <HI>then rehearse his mercies now;</HI> utter the memory of re∣deeming love, and sovereign grace. Fur∣ther—Be not partial in these hopes and prai∣ses; think not attendance here once, is suffi∣cient, but <HI>be constant</HI>—be persuaded to be constant in your sacrifices before GOD—Said the Psalmist, <HI>One thing have I desired of the Lord—that will I seek after, that, I may dwell in the house of the Lord, all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and enquire in his Temple.</HI> Let it <HI>be real</HI> that you de∣light in the service, and delight in draw∣ing near to GOD: then shall you not be disappointed: Then my dear friends, <HI>let us now,</HI> dedicate ourselves to GOD through the blood of the Lamb, and offer our bo∣dies as living sacrifices of praise to his name, <HI>in this place,</HI> which is now conse∣crated to him—Let us here live in mutual love and peace, and the GOD of peace will be

with us—and finally we shall meet in his presence, <HI>where is fulness of joy,</HI> and join in the seraphic anthems of redeeming love— and now while we view the great goodness of GOD on every side: Let us join in the language of the Psalmist. <HI>Thy mercy O Lord is great unto the Heavens, and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds—I will extol thee my</HI> GOD, <HI>O King: I will bless thy name for∣ever and ever—I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wonderous works—All thy works shall praise thee, and thy Saints shall bless thee—they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy pow∣er—Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion, declare among the people his doings. Sing unto the Lord O ye saints of his, give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness— sing unto the Lord a new song—play skillfully with a loud noise—Praise ye the Lord from the Heavens: Praise ye him in the heights — Praise ye him all his angels—Praise ye him all his hosts—Praise ye him Sun and moon— Praise him all ye stars of light—Praise him ye Heavens of Heavens, let them praise the name of the Lord—for he commanded and they were created—He hath also established them forever and ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Praise ye the Lord from the earth—Kings of the earth and all people, princes, and all

judges—Both Young men and maidens, old men and children—Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is excellent, his glory is above the earth and Heavens—He also exalteth the horn of his people, the Praise of all his saints.</HI></P>
<P>Finally—<HI>Praise</HI> GOD <HI>in his sanctuary—Praise him for his mighty acts—Praise him accord∣ing to his excellent greatness—Praise him with the sound of the trumpet—Praise him with the Psaltery and harp—Praise him upon the loud cymbals—let every thing that hath breath, Praise ye the Lord.</HI></P>
