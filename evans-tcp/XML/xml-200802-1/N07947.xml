<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the various Treatises that have been published for the Improvement and Assistance of Christians of different Classes, I have often lamented the want of some truly evangelical Manuel to put into the Hands of the Lambs of the Flock; who, as they are the Purchase of EMANUEL's Blood, and as their tender Minds stand in the greatest need of Cultivation, are certainly entituled to all the Helps we can furnish them with — As one (and I esteem it an essential) Part of my Duty, requires me to spend some Time, every Week, with Children of different Ages and Capacities; I have had great Opportunities of observing in what Manner, and by what Methods, divine Truths may be conveyed to their Minds so as to give them some Concern about their eternal State: The Reader will please to observe that I speak here of human Methods only, which it is our Duty to use looking to the Fountain of Life for a Blessing.</P>
<P>I am convinced from my own Observation, that those Methods under GOD, are the most likely to answer the salutary Purposes above mentioned, which aim not only at informing and settling the Judgment of young Persons, but also at affecting their Hearts, and infusing into them a Desire of experiencing those Comforts, their Judgment is informed true Religion will produce. In this main Point, viz. The affecting the Hearts of Children, all the Pieces calculated for their Instruction, I have hitherto met with, are very defective. The many Catechitical Tracts
<PB N="iv" REF="010142_0002_0F7D1C4661E92ED0"/>
published by Divines of our own Church, however useful to those of riper Years, and maturer Judgments, are but very few of them suited to the Capacities of Children; which all who have the Care of Youth must observe, can∣not be otherwise instructed than by <HI>Precept upon Precept, and Line upon Line, here a little and there a little.</HI> The few that are professedly wrote for the Edification of Young Ones, if they succeed in the first Part, viz. in storing the Mind with a Set of Principles, are very deficient in the latter, viz. in affecting their Hearts. For, however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trange it may seem to some, yet Experience shews us, that grown Persons, as well as Children, may have very ortho∣dox Principles or Notions in their Heads, and yet at the same Time be destitute of the least Spark of Grace in their Hearts. To kindle this divine Flame in young Breasts, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Work of the Spirit of GOD. But as in his ordinary Operations he makes use of Means, those Methods of In∣struction, which, at the same Time they inform the Judg∣ment are levelled at the Heart, seem to hid the fairest f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> being Instrumental in the Hands of this divine Agent.</P>
<P>As I have met with nothing of this Sort from any Wri∣ters of our own Church, neither have I, as yet, obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Satisfaction I wanted in this Particular, from any on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our dissenting Brethren.</P>
<P>The seraphick Dr. <HI>WATTS,</HI> indeed, has succeeded th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> best of any I have ever seen. His short Catechisms▪ Part fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and second, contain in them, a Fund of useful Instruction wrote in a plain familiar Stile and Manner, and ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the meanest Capacities. The Principles of the Christia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Religion are proposed, and clearly represented to the Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But then (it must be owned) that even Dr. <HI>WATTS,</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> failed in the main Point, I mean the applicatory Part whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is much to be lamented, that great Man never attempte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> since no one seemed so fitted for such a Task as himself.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="010142_0002_0F7D1C4661E92ED0"/>Mr. <HI>JANEWAY's Token for Children</HI> is indeed a very rich Treasure for Christian Jewels; but I humbly ap∣prehend it would have been still more useful, had an <HI>Ad∣dress to Children,</HI> been prefixed to it, or an <HI>Observa∣tion</HI> added at the End of each History (like the Moral in <HI>Aesop's</HI> Fables) tending to convince them that they likewise must be Partakers of the inestimable Blessings there descri∣bed, as ever they would see the Face of GOD.</P>
<P>I say nothing of our excellent <HI>Church Catechism,</HI> nor of that published by the <HI>Assembly,</HI> (both of them excellent Bodies of Divinity) as the generality will agree with me, that they are not so properly <HI>Milk for Babes,</HI> as <HI>Meat for Men.</HI></P>
<P>Such a Method of Instruction as I have described, having been so long wanting, I cannot but congratulate my Christian Brethren, on the Publication of the following <HI>DISCOURSE.</HI> I have perused it carefully, and think it admirably suited to the great Ends I have mentioned. The Author (whom I am proud to call my Friend) has happily discovered the Art of conveying the most interesting and important Truth in the easiest plainest and most engaging manner. His Stile is familiar, yet affecting; his Descriptions just and lively, his Instructions weighty, yet so pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asive, as to be the best suited for those to whom he offers them. He seems to find his Way to their tender Passions in the most pathetic Manner, and plays round their Hearts, as though deter∣mined not to leave the Pursuit till they are united to the Redeemer, of whom he speaks. He writes not for Criticks, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or to win the Praise of Men; but as one who has tasted that the Lord is gracious; the Language of his Heart is, <HI>Come ye Children, hearken unto me, and I will tell you what the Lord hath done for my Soul;</HI> and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eady to do for your's also.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="010142_0003_0F7D1C495CEC1938"/>The Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> of <HI>Justification by Faith,</HI> of <HI>imputed Righteousness,</HI> and of <HI>Sanctifica∣tion by the Holy Spirit;</HI> which distinguish the <HI>Church of England,</HI> from that of <HI>Rome,</HI> are fully, yet plainly deliveered in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is little <HI>TRACT.</HI></P>
<P>The Author's whole Soul seems engaged in this Work, and so warmly and affectionately does he press these Points upon young Consciences, that we haeve Reason to hope they will be signally blessed of GOD.</P>
<P>For my Part, I think it my Duty to recommend the fol∣lowing <HI>DISCOURSE,</HI> (as I hereby do to all Parents and Governours of Youth, as the most valuable Present they can possibly make their respective Charges. I look upon it as a proper Supplement to Dr. <HI>WATTS's</HI> shorter Catechisms. The Design of this being to carry home to the Heart what that venerable Man of God makes clear to their Under∣standings.</P>
<P>I would beg Leave in particular, to recommend it to the Parishioners of <HI>St Saviour's Southwark,</HI> earnestly entreating them to take especial Care of those tender Plants the Lord hath committed to their Trust: Which, that they may be watered by Divine Grace, preserved by the Holy Spirit in every Blast of Temptation, and at last be safely housed in the grand Paradise of GOD, is the sincere and fervent Prayer of their</P>

<P><PB N="9" REF="010142_0004_0F7D1C496507FEE8"/>But it may be, dear Children, you do not know who Jesus Christ is: Tho' you read of Jesus Christ in your Testaments, perhaps you have not considered, or thought much about Jesus Christ: Therefore you do not know him. You do nor love him: You never go to him. You never call upon him: You never ask Je∣sus Christ to bless you; nor you never thank him, though he loves you so much, so very much; yes indeed, he does.</P>
<P>O 'tis a sad Thing for little Children not to know, not to love Jesus Christ. Don't you remember what the Apolste tells you in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> Chap. 16. ver. 22. <HI>If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be accursed.</HI> O 'tis a thou∣sand Pities but that you should be told who Je∣sus Christ is, and how much he loves little Chil∣dren, what he has done for them, and how many good Things he every Day gives them. Surely if we considered this, you would love him. Are you w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ling then to hear of Jesus Christ? Do you desire to be told who he is, and what great Things Jesus Christ hath done for little Children? Should you not be glad to know how you must go to him? For he says, <HI>Suffer little Children to come unto me.</HI></P>
<P>Why then, for the Sake of dear little Chil∣dren, and because I love them, and would wish them to know and love Jesus Christ, that they may be happy: I have made this little Discourse
<PB N="10" REF="010142_0005_0F7D1C4A2B114C90"/>
on purpose to tell de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Children, who Jesus Christ i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and also what he has done for them; and likewise, how they are to go to Jesus Christ: Which if you do, I will also tell you what good Things, what great Blessings Jesus Christ will give you; for he says, <HI>Come unto me.</HI></P>
<P>But least I should write, and you dear Chil∣dren should read in vain, let us pray our dear Lord and Saviour, to send his Blessing upon this Work.</P>
<P><HI>O thou kind and loving Lord Jesus, who dost not despise the Day of small-Things; thou dear Saviour, who in the Days of thy Flesh, didst take little Chil∣dren into thine Arms and blessedst them; O do thou now seal Instruction upon their dear Hearts by thy blessed Spirit; impress their tender Minds with a sweet Sense of thy Love, and make even this lit∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Work, a blessed Means in thy powerful Hands of revealing thy Love, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to Babes!

he was, until that wicked One, the Devil, who is full of Spite and Malice against Man, came to him, and bid him not believe God, nor be obedient to do what God had told him; and how he hearkened to the Voice of the Devil, and so became proud; and instead of loving and fearing the Lord, and brok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God's Com∣mand; he did what God had told h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should not do; he eat the Fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Tree which God told him he sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not and so Man was changed in a Moment into the Shape of the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cked One.</P>

<P>For when <HI>Adam</HI> sinned against God, and lost the Heaven of God's Love and Favour, all his Children sinned in him; so that you and I, dear Children, are become Fellow-Sinners and Fel∣low Sufferers, by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall and Disobedience, so you read by the Offence of One, we are all made Sinners, and Death entered into the

World by Sin as God's Apostle tells you in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Chap of <HI>Romans,</HI> ver. 12.</P>
<P>So that, instead of being along with your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oving Saviour, in his holy happy Place of Glory, where there is no Darkness, no Sorrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Pain, no S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckness; you are forced to live here in a wicked, cruel, unkind World where you find a great deal of Trouble and Sorrow, and are sometimes Sick, and in Pain, and often cry for many Things you want, and are never truly happy, and are very seldom easy in your Minds.</P>
<P>O what a sad Thing it was for <HI>Adam</HI> to Sin against God! O what a miserable Thing it is that dear little Children are now become Sin∣ners! that they should Quarrel and Fight with one another; be Angry, and tell lies, and take God's Name in vain, and not love God, nor fear God, nor pray to God. O dear! What a sad, what an affecting Thing is this to think of!</P>
<P>But then, when you come to die: For my dear Children you are to live but a little, little while longer here. O, alas! this is very dread∣ful! to shut your Eyes never, never to open them any more! And that dear little Body must be put into the cold, dark Grave, &amp; Dirt thrown upon it, and the Worms will eat it up.</P>
<P>But then, O more dreadful still! You have, dear Children, Souls that can never die, but will live forever and ever. These after your Bodies
<PB N="14" REF="010142_0007_0F7D1C4BAC420C30"/>
die, must appear before the great God the Judge of all men, who will then tell you of, and will judge you for all your Sins, for every Idle wick∣ed Word, and every evil, sinful Thought; and then if you have no Friend to take your Part, no dear Saviour to beg for you! O most dread∣ful of all!</P>
<P>O! methinks I tremble to tell you what Je∣sus Christ says will bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of you! Read <HI>Mat.</HI> chap. 14. ver. 41. Oh! are not they terrible Words. <HI>Depart from me, ye cursed, into the everlasting Fire of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll, prepared for the Devil and his Angels: Where there is weeping and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailing, and gnashing of Teeth; Where their tor∣menting Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of Conscience never dies, nor the burning Fire of Pain, never goes out; and never never to come out of this Place of Torment!</HI> O surely, this is very affrighting!</P>
<P>O, but now, if I was to tell you of any good Person, who could save you, and keep you from all these terrible Things, would you not be very glad? Should you not be vastly delighted to know who it is? Would you not go to him, and pray to him, Night and Day, to do these Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or you? Would you not love him dearly, most dearly of all? Should you not? Now tell me, my dear Children?</P>
<P>O, yes, I think you say: O if any Body would save me from being naughty, and from being the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vil's Child, save me from going to
<PB N="15" REF="010142_0007_0F7D1C4BAC420C30"/>
Hell, I would, indeed I would love him. Would you so?</P>
<P>O, but suppose I was to tell you of one, who would do a great deal more than all this, even make you God Almighty's Child, and open the Door of Heaven to you, that when you come to die, you might be comfortable and glad, yes, and before you die, you might live holy, happy and joyful; and after Death find all Joy and Pleasure, and Comfort and Delight, for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Now would not this make your dear little Hearts glad within you? Now would it not? Yes, surely, it would. But O, where shall we find any one so full of Love and Goodness! No one is, but Jesus Christ: None but he is able to do this. And be glad, little Children, to hear what our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Saviour has done and suf∣fered, for all that come unto him, which was the next Thing I promised to tell little Children of</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>You are told how Jesus Christ loved the Children of Men, and pitied poor Sinners, and became their Saviour; and what Pains and Sorrows our dear Saviour went through, to save his dear Children from Hell, and to bring them to Heaven.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>O Methinks, you long to know. You are eager to hear what Jesus Christ did, and
<PB N="16" REF="010142_0008_0F7D1C4C65F02C68"/>
what Way he takes to save and make happy his dear Children.</P>
<P>You know I told you before, that we are all, of us become so unlike God, by Reason of Sin, that we are unfit to go to God and Heaven. Well then, Jesus Christ came down from Hea∣ven to Earth, to fetch us from the Earth to Heaven.</P>
<P>O, what Love is this! as we read in God's Book, 2 Epist. Cor. chap. 8. ver. 9. of <HI>the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, tho' he was rich, yet for your Sake became poor, that ye through his Poverty might be made rich.</HI> How poor did Jesus become? Why he that was Lord of all became a poor despised out-cast Babe. He took our Nature upon him, and was born into this World.</P>
<P>O he looked down from the Heaven of his Glory; he saw how Sin and Wickedness had ruined the dear Children of Men, and his loving Heart was set upon them, and he would come to save them; therefore he was born into this World, under all the Meanness, Poverty &amp; Dis∣grace which our Sins had deserved. His Pa∣rents were poor and mean: His Birth, instead of a Palace was a Stable: For a Cradle, a Man∣ger, where Oxen fed, was the Place where the Lord of Life and Glory was first laid. O what Love, what Humility is this!</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010142_0008_0F7D1C4C65F02C68"/>Now all this is to shew us what shame is due to Sin. Think of this dear little Children. See the Shame of Sin. See how low our Savi∣our stoop'd, how poor he became. Have you any Reason to be proud, and to love, and de∣sire the great and grand Things of this World? O learn of your Saviour to despise them.</P>
<P>Well, thus our dear Lord appeared in the Flesh, in our Nature, in our Stead. Thus he became a Child for the Sake of dear little Chil∣dren, that he might be their dear Brother and loving Saviour.</P>
<P>For your Sakes your Saviour begins his Life with Poverty and Disgrace; and as he grows up, his Sorrows and Sufferings increase with his Years. He had very few Friends that loved him. A great many Enemies that hated him. Few, very few, believed on him: He always went about doing Good: And yet he was al∣ways suffering Evil from the Children of Men.</P>
<P>He indeed was a Man of Sorrows, and ac∣quainted with Griefs, all his Life for your Sakes: All that he bore, all that he suffered, was in Love to his dear Children. His Life was a Life of Holiness and Love; and yet wicked Men agreed to take away his dear Life, to spill his precious Blood, and to murder this dear Savi∣our of ours.</P>
<P>O you may read how he is preparing for the Hour, the dismal Hour of his Death and Suffer∣ings,
<PB N="18" REF="010142_0009_0F7D1C4D8DB64100"/>
in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> chap. 22. ver. 44. see him in the Garden of <HI>Gethsemane,</HI> there in great Pain and Sorrow, he prayed to his Father; and what think you, my dear Children, was the Cause of all his Distress? O he feels the Load, he bears the Weight of all his dear Children's Sins upon him. He had no Sin of his own; but he un∣dertook our Cause, and all our Sins were laid upon his dear and innocent Head.</P>
<P>O this makes him groan, this makes him pray in the greatest Agony; they caused him to sweat and groan, and bleed; yea to sweat Drops, great Drops of precious Blood out of his inno∣cent Veins.</P>
<P>O dear little Children, think of this; consider what your loving Saviour once suffered for your Sins, for your Sakes, for your Souls; and this was on a dark Winter's Night, when the Air was sharp, frosty and cold.</P>
<P>O what great pains must your Sins put your dear Saviour to, to make him thus sweat, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were, great Drops of Blood falling from his Body to the Ground. O what an Agony, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a grievous Agony of Sorrow and Grief doth he feel! O how well did our Saviour love little Children.</P>
<P>But this is not all; no sooner were his Pray¦ers ended, but greater Sorrows, and more grie¦vous Pains are coming upon him; tho' he had gone up and down for near thirty Years, doin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="19" REF="010142_0009_0F7D1C4D8DB64100"/>
Good, and was always loving &amp; tender-hearted to all that came unto him: Yet O how barba∣rously is he used? for a great Multitude of rude, wicked Men come with Lanthorns and Staves, to take him.</P>
<P>O the dear, innocent Lamb! How is he de∣livered up to the Anger and Fury of Men, who like Lions and Bears, drag him away to the Governor of the City, and they tied those dear Hands behind him, which had been so often put forth to give Sight to the Blind, to cure the Sick, to give Life to the Dead, and had em∣braced little Children, when he blessed them, and also been very often lifted up in Prayer to his Father, for his Enemies.</P>
<P>Thus bound he stood before his Judge silent, tho' they laid many Things to his Charge, of which he was innocent, he said nothing; O, no: He knew he appeared in our Stead; we were guilty, and for our Sins he suffered.</P>
<P>But his Sufferings are not at an End yet; O no: Our Sins were laid upon him; for them he must bleed; for them he is willing to shed every Drop of his precious Blood. We were sold, all of us, my dear little Children, as Slaves to Sin and Satan; and nothing but Blood, the Blood of Jesus, the Blood of God, could buy our Liberty.</P>
<P>Christ freely gave himself for us: he hath bought us with his own Blood, and redeemed
<PB N="20" REF="010142_0010_0F7D1C4DEC189AD0"/>
us from being Enemies to God, and Slaves to Wickedness.</P>
<P>O then see, mark the Account, which is gi∣ven of our dear Saviour after he was condemn∣ed to die.</P>
<P>His cruel Enemies led him away, and they scourged him with Cords, till they cut deep Gashes on his naked Body.</P>
<P>Then they made a Crown of Thorns, which were sharp pointed like a Sword. This they put on his dear sacred Head, and smote upon it, till they forced the Points into the Temples of his Head; and the Blood trickled down his innocent Face.</P>
<P>Thus he was wounded from Head to Foot. And why was this done? but on Account of our sad State and miserable Condition, as God's Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> sets it forth, chap. 1. ver. 6. our whole Head is sick, our whole Heart is faint; from the Sole of the Foot, even unto the Head, there is no sound Part in us; but we are all fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of Wounds and Bruises &amp; putrifying Sores.</P>
<P>So our dear Jesus was wounded from Head to Foot; that by his S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ripes and Blood, we might be healed of all the Sicknesses of our Souls.</P>
<P>Thus the Blood trickled down from every Part of his innocent Body; and yet this doth not satisfy the cruel Rage of his Enemies; for they spit upon him, they mocked him, and made Game of him.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="010142_0010_0F7D1C4DEC189AD0"/>O how easy could our dear Saviour have look∣ed them dead, and frowned them into Hell in a Moment; but no, we see he is patient &amp; meek; he opens not his Mouth, neither doth he cry nor complain.</P>
<P>O what Love, what Patience is this! never was the like seen before! But yet more &amp; more of his Love for Sinners is to be seen, and more of his Sufferings is still to come.</P>
<P>Die he must. He is condemned: And there∣fore they drag him away. They lay his heavy Cross upon his naked, wounded Body, which he carries till he is faint and tired. All about him were his Enemies laughing, and mocking him, until he comes in Sight of mount Calvary. Thither he goes up, and his Cross being laid on the Ground, they stretch out his dear Arms wide. Thro' the Palms of his holy, tender Hands▪ and thro' his sacred Feet, they drive large Nails, and so fasten him to the Cross; and then lifted it up from the Ground. Thus the dear Lord Jesus hangs on the accursed Tree.</P>
<P>Is not this enough to make your dear little Hearts ake, and cause you to weep and cry, to think of his Pains and Agonies? And yet, O how cruel and hard hearted are Men! They see him and they wag their Heads. They look on him thus, in the greatest Pain; and they had no Pity, no Mercy on him; but they still mocked, still laughed at him. O the Racks
<PB N="22" REF="010142_0011_0F7D1C4EA0BDCE30"/>
and Tortures of his Body! O the Pains and Sorrows of his Soul, which was now made a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Offering for his dear Children's Sins.</P>
<P>Hark! he Groans! Listen to his Prayer. O what doth the dear and suffering Lamb say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Doth he open his Mouth in Anger, and call for Punishment on his Enemies! O no: But <HI>Fa∣ther forgive them, for they know not what they do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></P>
<P>O what heavenly Love! what a sweet for∣giving Temper was our dear Saviour of! He seems to forget all his own most distressing Pains; and is more concerned for his very Murderers, than for himself.</P>
<P>O what Pain must it be to hang but a few Minutes on the Cross. But Jesus hung thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the greatest Pain and Agony, for full three Hours! No Eye pitied him; no one off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red him any Comfort; no, even God his dear Fa∣ther, who said, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,</HI> now pours forth the Fury of his Wrath, and fiercest Anger upon him. For in his well beloved Son, he punished our Sins most severely.</P>
<P>At last, behold a Soldier stabs a sharp-pointed Spear into his precious Side, so that he shed his dearest Heart's Blood for our Sins.</P>
<P>Thus wearied out with Pain and Sorrow, and Agony, such as Man never felt before, just be∣fore he gave up the Ghost and died, he bowed his Head to the Earth, as much as to say to us
<PB N="23" REF="010142_0011_0F7D1C4EA0BDCE30"/>
Sinners, behold and see how much I love you! O was there ever Sorrow, ever Pain, ever Love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike mine! And with a loud Voice Jesus cried, IT IS FINISHED! as much as tho' he had said, My Sufferings are now at an End, and the Re∣demption of Sinners, of all my dear Children, whom I so love, is now finished and made an End of—and Jesus died.</P>
<P>And now my dear Children, you have heard of the Kindness and Love of our dear Saviour. Now don't you think he loves you? And are you not very glad to hear of the great Love of your only Lord and Saviour? And are you not sorry and grieved to know how much Pain, and Agony and Sorrow Jesus suffered for you, and for your Sins.</P>
<P>O but if I was to tell you no more of Jesus, you would still have the greatest Reason, to mourn and weep, to think that your only Sa∣viour is dead; because you could never go to him, nor receive any Blessings or Comforts from him.</P>
<P>But I tell you glad Tidings of great Joy; for tho' Jesus was dead, he is now alive again. He only lay three Days in the Grave, and then raised himself from the Dead, and appeared a∣gain to comfort his sorrowful Friends and Dis∣ciples; and staid upon Earth forty Days. Then he went up to Glory, where he lives forever more
<PB N="24" REF="010142_0012_0F7D1C53169163B8"/>
to receive and pray for all dear Children, that come unto God by him, and in his Name.</P>
<P>And now, whatever Blessings you want, if you go to Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Christ, and tell him, he will he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r you, and he will give you: For no good Thing will God wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h-hold from those Children that go to him.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A very pretty Story of a dear little Child, who loved her Saviour; in which you are told, how good she was, how holy and happy she lived, and how comfortably she died.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUt first, let me tell you of your dear School-Fellow: O how soon was she took sick and died! she came from School on Saturday, well as you be now; the next Day the Fever seiz'd her; before the Week was ended, Death had laid his cold Hand upon, and made her a pale, breathless Corpse.</P>
<P>Now you know her Father had a great deal of Money to have given her, and many fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cloaths, but none of these could save her from dying▪ O but it was happy for her, she loved her Savi∣our better than a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l these, and she always took more Delight &amp; Pleasure in going to her Saviour, and praying to him than in any Thing else in all the World: And you would do the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, if you did but love our Saviour, and knew that he loved you. As soon as she got up in the Morn∣ing, the first Thing she did, was to go and pray to her dear Saviour, after this Manner:</P>
<P><HI>O my dear and only Saviour, my Lord and my God; what Care dost thou take of thy dear little Child? Lord, I thank thee for all thy Love, and for all thy Goodness to me Dear Jesus give me to know more and more of thy Love! O shed thy
<PB N="28" REF="010142_0014_0F7D1C556AC92BB8" MS="y"/>
Love abroad in my Heart! O be my Saviour! Save me this Day from my own naughty wicked Heart. Save me from this evil World. Dear Saviour, save me from my great Enemy the Devil. O that I may bate Sin, and love and serve thee all my Days, till Death comes; and then dear Jesus, after I have thus come unto thee, and loved thee on Earth, O take my Soul up to thy Self in Glory, to praise thee for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>And when she came from School, when other Children are only minding their Play; O she was glad to get by herself, and to go to her dear Sa∣viour, and pray to him; and he always heard her and gave her every Thing that she wanted.</P>
<P>O how glad was he when the Lord's Day came that she might go and pray with God's People, and hear God's Ministers preach about Jesus Christ, and his Love to poor Sinners! Whenever she saw any poor People in the Streets, that wanted Victuals and Cloaths, her Heart pitied them; and she was glad if she had any Thing to give them.</P>
<P>She was very dutiful to her Parents, very lov∣ing to all her Brothers and Sisters; yea, she lived in Love with every Body.</P>
<P>Thus she lived happy, for she knew her Savi∣our loved her; she knew he died for her Sins; she knew she was God almighty's Child, and that he had forgiven all her Sins; for he had given her to know this by his blessed Spirit
<PB N="29" REF="010142_0014_0F7D1C556AC92BB8"/>
in her Heart, which made her hate Sin, and fear to offend God.</P>
<P>But O when she was sick, and when she came to die, had you, dear Children, seen how sweet she looked, how she smiled, and was glad to think she was going to die, that she might go to her dear Saviour, and live with him for ever and ever.</P>
<P>O I think you would have wished to have been in her Place! Just before Death closed her dear eyes, never, never to open them in this World any more, she called her Papa &amp; Mama to her Bedside, and said' "Don't you, pray don't you cry, nor grieve your selves for me; I am only going a little before you: My dear Saviour loves me; I know he does: I feel he does. I shall soon be with him; he will soon take my dear Soul to himself in Glory."</P>
<P>Then she called to her dear little Brothers and Sisters, &amp; said to them, O, I charge you to go to my dear Saviour, &amp; pray to him to save you. O he has been a dear &amp; loving Saviour to me all my Life! and now I am so del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hted, so glad I am going to live with him for ever and ever. She lifted up her dying Eyes, and as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she was able, she said, "Lord Jesus, receive my Spirit:" and with a smiling Face she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell asleep in the arms of her dear Saviour.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="010142_0015_0F7D1C566537B5C0"/>O now would you not desire to live and di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> like her?

<P>O what a Comfort is this! Would you not, dear Children, think it a very great Thing to be the Children of an earthly King. O but how much greater is it to be Sons &amp; Daughters of the King of Kings, the Lord God Almighty! What, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have God for your Father, to take you and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn you, &amp; love you as his own dear Children! O surely, this is the greatest of all Blessings in∣deed! What! Children that are born Children of Wrath, deserving God's Anger and Punish∣ment, to be taken into God's Love and Favour;
<PB N="34" REF="010142_0017_0F7D1C57B1CF30B0"/>
to be owned and loved by him as his dear Chil∣dren! O tell me, is not this enough to encou∣rage you gladly to come unto Jesus Christ? O it is our dear Saviour that obtained this Blessing for all his dear Children! tho' they were Ene∣mies and Strangers to God, yet by his Blood he hath reconciled, and made Peace, and brought them back to God, so that they receive a New Birth; they are born again of the Spirit of God and become the Children of God by Faith in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>Indeed, dear Children, without this New Birth, without being made the Children of God, your Saviour himself assures, <HI>You cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> Joh. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>Ye must be born again,</HI> saith our Saviour.</P>
<P>O, I pray you, consider the many and great Blessings and Comforts that are yours, if you are the Children of God, by Faith in Christ Jesus; why God tells you, by the Mouth of his be∣loved Apostle, <HI>All Thing are yours.</HI> God is yours; he is your heavenly Father. Christ is yours; he is your loving Brother and Saviour. The Holy Ghost is yours; to comfort and make you holy. Heaven is yours; the Place so your everlasting Happiness and Joy. And till you get to Glory the Earth is yours. All Things that you want, that are for your good, your heavenly Father will give you. So saith our Saviour. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness, and all
<PB N="35" REF="010142_0017_0F7D1C57B1CF30B0"/>
other Things shall be given unto you, Mat.</HI> 6.33.</P>
<P>O dear how rich, how vastly rich are God's Children; the richest King upon Earth is not half so rich as they are. O this is to be truly rich, truly great and noble indeed! These are the <HI>true Riches,</HI> which our Saviour bids all his dear Children covet and pray for: For indeed without this Kind of Riches, the richest Man upon Earth is as poor as a Beggar, and as mise∣rable as a Slave.</P>
<P>For if any one, be he who he will, Rich or Poor, Young or Old Man, or Woman, or Child, <HI>If any one hath not the Spirit of Christ,</HI> in his Heart, <HI>be is none of his,</HI> saith the Word of Truth, <HI>Rom. Chap.</HI> 8. <HI>ver.</HI> 19. he doth not belong to Christ, nor doth God own him as his Child. O then, with∣out Doubt, they are the Children of the Wicked One; they are led by his Spirit, his Servants and Children they are. For ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Saviour saith to all such <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and his Works ye will do.</HI> Joh. chap. 8. ver. 49.</P>
<P>So that such Men and Women, and Children, who Curse and Swear, get Drunk, Steal, tell Lies, break God's Sabbaths, and do any such like, Wickedness, it is because they don't know our Saviour, nor pray to him nor believe on him; nor have they got the Spirit of Christ in their Hearts.</P>
<P>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is not so with God's Children; for their Jesus delivers them out of their fallen sinful State and brings them into a new State of Holiness.
<PB N="36" REF="010142_0018_0F7D1C58734774E8"/>
Christ unites them to himself by Faith. and he sends his Holy Spirit into their Hearts.</P>
<P>Yes, you may be sure of this, for Gods Word which is the Word of Truth, tells you so in Gal. 4.6. <HI>Because we are Children of God, God hath sent forth his Spirit into our Hearts, whereby we call God Father,</HI> Our Father. <HI>His Spirit bears Witness with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, dear Children, you shall know this in your own Hearts, if you come to our Saviour, and believe on him; and this blessed Spirit will tell you, that you are God's dear Children; and assure you of God's Love to you; and now he has forgiven you all your Sins; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very Thing you have done amiss; and will also make you good Children. You will hate all Lying, &amp; Wick∣edness, &amp; you shall be happy and comfortable; for God will give you to see and enjoy all these great and unspeakable Blessing which are yours, as bought for you, by your dear Saviour, even all those good Things which are written in that best of Books, the Bible.</P>
<P>So that if o her Children beast and brag what fine Cloaths they have got, how very rich their Fathers are, what grand Houses they live in, and how much Pleasure they take, and what fine Sights they see; O do you be glad, do you be delighted and rejoice every Day to read in your Bibles, what Treasures, what vast &amp; never fad∣ing Treasures of heavenly Riches are yours.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="010142_0018_0F7D1C58734774E8" MS="y"/>O the dear Children of God are all Heirs or a Kingdom. Shortly they shall wear Crown of pure Gold upon their Hearts, and stand be∣fore God, their Father, in long white Robes in that <HI>glorious Gity, which is of pure Gold,</HI> (Rev. chap. 21. ver. 18. &amp; 21.) <HI>and where all the Street are of pure Gold.</HI></P>
<P>For yet a little while, <HI>and the Day of the Lord shall come, in the which the Heaven shall pass away with a great Noise, and the Elements shall melt with fervent Heat, and the Earth also, and all the Works that are therein shall be burnt up.</HI></P>
<P>Then shall your Saviour, your King and your God, appear in his Glory, with all the heavenly Hosts of Angels and Archangels with him, and every Eye shall see him.</P>
<P>O but the Wicked, such as never sought him, such as were never delivered from their sinful State; nor believed on him, nor loved him, when they were upon Earth; O they will strive to hide themselves from him, but in vain; they will be ashamed to look on him, when they think how they slighted him, how they pierced him with their Sins. O it will be a dreadful, terri∣ble Day indeed to all such.</P>
<P>But all God's dear Children, O they will lift up their Heads with Joy; they will look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with gladness; and their dear Saviour will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mile upon them; he wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l own them, and will embrace hem, and fill their happy Souls as full of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="38" REF="010142_0019_0F7D1C596CAD0300"/>
Love and glory, and comfort as ever they can h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld. He will take them up unto himself, and they shall live and praise, and reign wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their God and Saviour for ever and ever.</P>
<P>O, surely dear Children, nothing, no nothing should hinder you from coming to such a good▪ such a loving Saviour as our Jesus is!</P>
<P>O then do not say, I am not old enough, nor big enough to seek Jesus, and to know thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Things, O dear Children, none of you are to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> young, nor too little to know and love our Sa¦viour; you cannot seek him too soon: If yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can but read this little Discourse, and desir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jesus to bless you: indeed it is fit yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should go to Jesus.
