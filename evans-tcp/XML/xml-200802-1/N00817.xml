<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>MAny Readers no sooner take a Book in hand, but they look for the Authors Name, and according as they believe or have received Reports of the Author, so they Judge of the matter in the Book, even before they read it. Therefore as the <HI>Quakers</HI> oft use to do, I have only put the two first Letters of my name, that if thereby you know me not, you may read before you Judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>This small piece had not come forth now had not the <HI>Quakers</HI> called for it in their last Book printed in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> they want, it seems, to have unclean Persons among them made publick; for they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>They have none such;</HI> therefore I have in the following <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made a troop of them as publick; I think as they can desire, and I here let them know that I could have named <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> more of their Ministers guilty of Whoring and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, only they have acted i more privately that these; for which reason I omit them; yet if they call for these, they shall have their names and their facts too at large 'tis but ask and have.</P>
<P>Yet th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I say nevertheless, if the <HI>Quaker</HI> Humility would suffer them to come down to the common Rank, of other Mortals, if they would acknowledge themselves to be fail∣able and deceiveable, like other men, and that they may put Darkness for Light &amp; Light for Darkness as well as others, &amp; are no surer of their Inspirations than we are of ours; if they would freely own t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, then shall they be admitted to the common Priviledges of Mankind; and in such case, it would be highly Uncharitable and a great sin to expose the private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anings of any.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000982_0004_0FAE8F8AF16E3490"/>
But if they will stand upon the Pinacle above the level of all the rest of Mankind, or of all who call themselves <HI>Christians,</HI> then must they expect to have their sailings exposed, and not to be spared; for there is no other way to humble them; And if they understood themselves, they would desire, and not complain to be brought to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st; our Saviour provoked the Jews to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Which of you [said he convin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth me of sin?</HI> and if the <HI>Quakers</HI> had an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing portion of the same Spirit, as they pretend and were free from sin, they would be further Justified by the stricte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t search that could be made into their Lives and Actions; but for them to complain of this, as hard usage and claim all that <HI>Charitable covering</HI> of faults, which is necessary for frail sinners, is a bewraying of their false pre∣tence to Innocency and Perfection.</P>
<P>And yet they will keep up their pretence, tho every one of them should fall after one another; for they hold for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir <HI>London</HI> Yearly Meeting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>stle for 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>This th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r prin∣ciples are the same as ever they were;</HI> and for confirmation hereof, I find that in their answer to those h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ps of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fusion that Mr. Leeds quotes out of their Books, they do not own one error no, not one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailing in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Books. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> must not in the least give way. But observe, if any of them fall, the rest say, <HI>it was because he kept not to his Light within,</HI> so of a second, a third, a fourth, &amp;c. How then are they kept more secure from falling then others? how was their friend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kept more secure who hanged himself, and several others of them about <HI>Delaware,</HI> that have been distracted, and attempted to put an end to their own Lives? How are these distinguished or kept more secure than others? And tho' this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> lived as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/> and removed from <HI>Long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> near to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> that he might have in the heavenly M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>azeen of their Preachers and Meetings, as many others has done, yet all this keeps them
<PB N="5" REF="000982_0005_0FAE8F8D783465B0"/>
more secure from the snares of the Devil than other <HI>Christians,</HI> whom the <HI>Quakers</HI> have damned as worse than Infidels.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> I have account that the <HI>Quakers</HI> Justices of the <HI>Burlington</HI> at ther first Court after they had re-ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d the saddle of Govern∣ment, preferred two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the grand Jury against Mr. Leeds for something he had printed against them; but it happened that the Sheriff had been so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, than he had put some on the Jury that were not of that Tribe, who would not suffer the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be found against him, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturned them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> so that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hopes of Revenge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I note <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because I perceive Mr. Leeds knowing how easie 'tis for them, it God give them leave to exercise their power, against him, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of himself and family, is willing to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> till the wheel has its proper motion.</P>
<P>But will the Quakers seek revenge? No, They will not do that for a world for they say in their Catachism by W. S. <HI>p. 79 'Tis the disposition of our nature not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Revenge, tho' we do suffer wrong; for the Revenging Nature is on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but it is not so with us whom God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> redeemed</HI> &amp;c. But this passage so gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly gives the lye to their Natures that it needs no other Remark. Therefore I now come to the matter.</P>

<P>I shall now open the Cage and take out the Birds one by one, and open their wings and spread their Feathers, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> view them, and note their Features and observe their Natures. But first, take notice that <HI>G. Fox</HI> [as in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pistle to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Churches] uses to call the Professors and church of England <HI>A CA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E of unclean Birds,</HI> and the more he made them sing was <HI>No perfection Here, No Per∣fection Here.</HI> Therefore the note the <HI>Quakers</HI> sing is, Perfection as Here, Perfection Here; &amp; my present business is to shew how far the <HI>Quakers</HI> have attained Perfection here beyond others, that they themselves may, if possible, see the danger of their self-righteous, self-confident state And first,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Samuel Jennings</HI> is the most aspiring bird in the CAGE, in that his intollerable Pride has led him to assume a far higher station then Lord Bishop of <HI>Delaware,</HI> he talking as if himself were the Almighty, saying to some se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erate <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uakers, If I draw forth my hand against you. I WILL Not pull it in again till I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> compare this speech with Deut. 32 40. Again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said he need not the help of Gods Spirit, to do our business as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> These Arrogant speeches [as I remember] he owns in print.</P>
<P>But one crim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this lofty Bird is that he has led the way to set the <HI>Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans</HI> to mischief the Inhabitants, in that he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d about 12 years since take up &amp; survey some of the <HI>Indians</HI> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, and by his example, others have since done the like, of which 50 or 60 <HI>Indians</HI> have lately drawn up a complaint in writing by two Interpreters, wherein they threaten to call other <HI>Indians</HI> to their Aid, to make war on the Inhabitants, unless they have Justice done. Whereupon Jennings had no way to save his <HI>Quaker</HI> Principle of a sinless Perfection, but to pretend Thy virtue of a cheat put upon the <HI>Indians</HI> by A R one of his Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dom Brother preachers too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said Land was pur∣chased of the Indians. And yet in contradiction to himself,
<PB N="8" REF="000982_0008_0FAE8F8F74011C40"/>
he and his followers do acknowledge the said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for they condition with those that settle they Land, privately to buy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the said <HI>Indians;</HI> But this not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> be∣cause some keep the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> land unsettled, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore they have [since M. Hamliton has re-install'd them in the Government] bountifully treated all the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Province, and gave the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great Gifts; but place it as a debt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to pay, [Asses being made to bear Burthens] but no matter who pays it hereafter, the <HI>Indians</HI> have got it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hoped are qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted at present.</P>
<P>Nay, this B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d must be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apital tradiction singer in <HI>West-Jarsey,</HI> for he lately wrote a Book herein he shews [from an <HI>English</HI> law made chiefly against <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>] that the people are disloyal to the King, if they submit to any Governour that has not the Royal approbation, and yet no sooner was his said Book made publick, but he himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eads the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t example of disloyalty, and submits to Mr. <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ton a Scotch m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> as Governour, who has not the said approbation; doubtless he was guided by his Light within in both there.</P>

Shin</HI> married about the same time, who was one of their womens Meeting, and a good woman, as themselves say, yet they could not for religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake, be at that Marriage; no, not so much as her Father <HI>John Shin</HI> a grave antient <HI>Quaker</HI> durst appear at this his Daughters Wedding, tho' forsooth! he could be at his Friend <HI>Williams</HI> his house, at this big bell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Damsels, We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding, and the reason was, The man whom this <HI>M. S.</HI> married could not agree to <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Tradition of their M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and Womens Mee∣tings in the case of Marriage, which the said big belly'd Damsel punctually observed. So short are these <HI>Quakers</HI> of true Re∣ligion that they prefer the Tradition of their great <HI>Fox</HI> before Honesty and Piety, of which take one more Example to establish the truth hereof.</P>
<P><HI>Daniel Wills</HI> one of the most eminent elders of <HI>Burlington</HI> Meeting, his daughter married the aforesaid <HI>R. Ewer,</HI> who at the time of his marriage was known to be guilty as aforesaid, also this Daughter of <HI>D. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> the bride, was then with Child, and has since owned condemnation for the same, and got into the Church again by a Paper-Key but they proceeding in their Marriage in all the formalities of <HI>G. Fox</HI> this Wedding was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the attendance of their Father <HI>D. W.</HI> and the rest of the Friends, Preachers and others.</P>
<P>But a little before, when a Son of this <HI>D. W.</HI> married, tho' they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lay no evil to the charge of him or the Woman he married, being both <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet the Religion of this <HI>D. W.</HI> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Father, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>Fox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> an Tribe, would not suffer them to be at this marriage, and the reason is, this Son of <HI>D. W</HI> also rejects the Authority of their Men and Womens Meetings in the case of marriage, believing it rather
<PB N="19" REF="000982_0019_0FAE8F99F0318258"/>
belongs to the Civil Magistrates. Thus you see how these blind Idolitors worship their Image of Men and Womens Meetings [which <HI>Fox</HI> carved cut and set up instead of Bap∣tism and the Lord Supper] without regard to honesty.</P>
<P>I remember <HI>D. W.</HI> has more then once related a story of <HI>Wm. Green</HI> and <HI>The West</HI> two of their <HI>Northampton Preach∣ers,</HI> of their naughtiness with Women, <HI>Green</HI> being twice found guilty before they quite silenced his preaching; But <HI>T. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> preaching at a Meeting soon after he had lain with another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wife, <HI>D. W.</HI> opposed his preaching from a spiritual discerning that he said he had of this preachers state, without any outward knowledge of it. But pray what's become of his discerning in the case of <HI>Robert Ewer?</HI> there he has either left it, or never had it; for he did not discern R. E. he never opposed his preaching.</P>
<P>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give one instance more, to shew that these <HI>Quakers</HI> are all under the like Judgment of Darkness, and want of Discerning. They did in the year 1696 build a great Cathe∣dral Meeting place at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and in order to lay such a Foundation Practice as they were like to continue, the very first Marriage [as am credibly informed] they passed there, the woman (<HI>Magdalen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> by name) brought a Child in her belly, when she came thither to publish her Intentions of Marriage, and not one of the infallible Friends could discern it; but on the contrary, congratulated her present happy condition, her former husband being a seperate <HI>Quaker!</HI></P>
<P>But on the account of such, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abominated actions of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I must be careful to keep from <HI>Pennsilvania</HI> shore, left I write a volumn, &amp;c besides, the <HI>Quakers</HI> and reflect on me far this little, and say, 'tis a taking up dirt: But let me tell them, that <HI>West-Jarsey Quakers,</HI> found it need∣full of late to rake up such dirt in order to make heir Teacher S. J. clean; that is, the sent Certificates to the said <HI>Jenings</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="000982_0020_0FAE8F9AD86842B0"/>
for him to print when last in <HI>England,</HI> to clear him of the charges proved against him in the tryal of P. B. which being printed in <HI>England</HI> some of the Books came back to <HI>Delaware,</HI> in which Certificates, the way they take to clear [<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is to rake up dirt Rediculous stuff] against the witnesses to make their evidence seem false. One when he was a ser∣vant boy, they accuse for stealing of his masters Powder, shot, Oits, and nobody knows what. Another, eat up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>risses Eggs. Other two of the witnesses, they say, that dis∣credit stands on their Court book for getting young women with Child. This they slanderously put down, for they should only have blamed them for their wives seeming in less then nine months after marriage, but this is the art they use to make people think their evidence against S J. was false.</P>
<P>But mark how God confounds them in the Devices they have used to Just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves and defame others; for no sooner was the said Certificate Book arrived at <HI>Delaware,</HI> but it fell to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lot of <HI>John W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsford,</HI> one of the signers of those Certificates, to be taken in the same snare, and all the Country round taking such notice of his wife bringing a Child to soon after Marriage, he, for grief or shame, or both, because it could not be kept hid [as was Judged] he fell sick and died there∣upon.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> As to the Birds in the Cage, least <HI>Peter Fretwell</HI> should grudge that his crimes are not so great as some of his fellows, I here let him know, that he stands presented by the grand Jury at <HI>Burlington</HI> for his disobedience to Government, and if ever you beheld a Swine led by the Bars, or a Beast by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and saw how they stubbornly set their feet as shores against the ground, because they will not come for∣ward, but as forced by great strength, just so for all the world did this <HI>Fretwell</HI> [when the Sheriff and his assistants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him before Authority] and that in such a brutish man∣ner
<PB N="21" REF="000982_0021_0FAE8F9DCC4B4338"/>
as all the sober beholders were a shamed to see. Nor could he any other ways be prevailed with to come to give account what he had done with the County <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the former grand Jury had raised and put into his hands as Treasurer; for that was all that the Magistrates wanted to know of him, being appointed by the grand Jury to examine him; and where he was thus brought, he would neither give any account to them, nor give bayl to answer next Court, but a Prison he would rather endure, and to prison he went, to the shame of his Profession be it spoken.</P>
<P>Also in the year 1697. When <HI>D. Bacon</HI> a seperate <HI>Quaker</HI> refused to serve on a Jury, pleading the English Law for his defence, this <HI>Fretwell</HI> being Justice, told him in open Court, <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f be pleaded matter of conscience, he should be excused, but if he pleaded the English Law, they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him;</HI> which ac∣cordingly they did. Where note, there were two gentlemen of the Governou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Council sitting in that Court with the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> who dissented from them in this Arbitrary procedure, and being over voted by the <HI>Quaker</HI> Justices, they desired their dissent in that case might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>red by the Clerk.</P>

<P>THE last instance of P. F. has occasioned a few more such instances of the <HI>Quakers</HI> actions in their Gover∣ment.

may as by one glass of Liquor know the relish of the whole Cark.</P>
<P>The first then is, of one <HI>John Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bold,</HI> who was no <HI>Quaker,</HI> he had by the appointment of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in Authority taken up, possessed and occupyed a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice of Land near <HI>Delaware</HI> hills, by the right of his Father then in <HI>England:</HI> and this Land lying very desirable and commodious for his Neighbour <HI>John Lambert,</HI> who knowing the said <HI>Newbold</HI> had not Power to dispose thereof, resolves to take it from him by force, and takes this course to do it <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> At seed time he takes witness with him, and scatters some Corn on the ground: and the said <HI>Newbold</HI> plowing and sowing as he used to do, at harvest when he and his <HI>Reapers</HI> were reaping their Corn. <HI>Lambert</HI> comes with his Brother <HI>Th. Lambert</HI> and <HI>Mahlon Stacy,</HI> two Justices, with their Servants, and takes the said <HI>Newbold</HI> and his Reapers, and carries them away Prisone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and <HI>Newbold</HI> not having Friends nor Power to oppose, was forced to yeild up the said Land, and <HI>Lambert</HI> got it in spite of Justice, which never could since be regained. <HI>Mr. Revell,</HI> who was then their Clerk, can relate the circumstances of this un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st action at large. Note, this was the beginning when the <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>akers</HI> had newly imbraced their beloved Government, when they were so extream covetous of Land, that they could not afford a piece of ground at <HI>Burlington</HI> to bury their dead, but buryed in the publick street or high way, where usually Malefactors are buryed; which irreligious practice, an eminent person observing, together with some other Ignoble Passages in the foundation of <HI>Burlington,</HI> made this Achrostick poem thereon</P>

<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> But as they began, so they proceeded on; for tho' they that inhabited there had Land in every street in <HI>Burlington,</HI> yet none of them could afford a piece where on to build their Meeting house, but they built on <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Rudyards</HI> Land, who then dwelt i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>London;</HI> and this they did without his leave or knowledge; Tho' indeed at the said <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dyards</HI> arrival there they proposed to buy it of him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them a price of fifteen Pounds, which was moderate, but they thought it too much, and would not give it.

Thus you may perceive the <HI>Quakers</HI> have need to strive hard to keep the Government, for it they loose the Government, they loose their Meeting House, if Law and Justice take peace.</P>

3<HI>dly, Walther Reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> a poor man finding it hard living at his first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tling, he got sum pine Trees off from unsurveyed Land, and cut them into Boards to sell to sustain his necessity, but he being no <HI>Quaker,</HI> the <HI>Quakers</HI> to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k the said Boards from him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> allowing him any thing for his labour, which was Partial and Unjust, nay, wicked, to wrong the poor man of his labour; I say, partial because several Quakers about <HI>Burlington</HI> have done the like, and suffered nothing; also <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and his Brother, and others about <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> have well advanced their Estates by Board and Shingles so gotten, &amp; never had a penny∣worth taken from them.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th,</HI> They have a law in <HI>West Jarsey </HI> to punish breakers of the Sabbath by a forfeiture of six shillings to be taken of the offenders goods, if they refuse to pay; and <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hn O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>borne,</HI> who was no <HI>Quaker</HI> having brought home his Horse or Mare on a Sabbath day morning, that had st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayed from him fettered, for which they demanded the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forfeiture for breach of Sabbath, but <HI>Ogborne</HI> refused to pay, alledging he had not broke the Sabbath, having done no more then as helping an Ox or an Ass out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, whereupon they without regard to their Law, imprisoned <HI>Ogborne,</HI> and prosecute him next Court. This, I say, was Arbitrary, and also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> partial, because most of their <HI>Quaker</HI> Justices of that Court had been really guilty of breaking the said Law, as could be proved, and yet suffered nothing &amp; especially <HI>Fra D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>venport,</HI> who about the same time had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sisted with his Team on a Sabbath day, to draw a Boat on the Road from <HI>Burlington</HI> toward <HI>West-Jarsey,</HI> who was President or Judge in that Court, and yet had the confidence to Prosecute <HI>Ogborne</HI> contrary to their own Law too.</P>

<PB N="25" REF="000982_0025_0FAE8FA177D75190"/>
and there was no proof but the girls affirmation, they released the girl out of his service [which some thought to be the end for which she so accused him] and whipt the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/><HI>Oldale</HI> for his first punishment, and, made him pay a twenty pound Fine for his second, no less then two punishments for one offence; &amp; that but a supposed offence neither, because never any thing after appeared to prove it. But on the other hand, when the aforesaid <HI>Williams</HI> had got his daughter-in-law with Child, which was a real crime, obvious and evident, yet they could easily let him escape without any punishment at all for why? <HI>Williams</HI> was a zealous <HI>Quaker,</HI> but <HI>Oldale</HI> was no <HI>Quaker,</HI> but one of the worlds People.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> The <HI>Quaker</HI> Juryes are very zealous [forsooth] to present men for fornication, whose wives bring Children in less then 9 months after Marriage, &amp; then the Justices of the Court fine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for it; but by what Law they do this, would fain be known, seeing our English Law makes such Children lawfully begotten. But on the other hand, this real of theirs has not appeared against their own Brethren in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> case, for I can name them two at once, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>W L</HI> and <HI>W D.</HI> who published their Marriage at their Meeting at <HI>Burlington</HI> whose wives brought Children in two months after Marriage, yet th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se were never presented; nor was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. presented who had a Child before Marriage, the Woman he Married being the daughter of a Preacher and Justice in <HI>Burlington.</HI></P>
<P>The like Justice have the <HI>Quakers</HI> observed in the prosecution of their Law that forbids selling or giving strong liquor to the <HI>Indians;</HI> they have made many poor man [or any but their own people] pay a fine of five Pounds and Court charges for selling strong drink to the <HI>Indians;</HI> But themselves having the power in their own hands, have sold and given them whole casks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at a time, in buying their Land, and making them treats, and the like, but never suffered any thing for it. And
<PB N="26" REF="000982_0026_0FAE8FA22F3B7610"/>
thus runs the currant of the <HI>Quaker</HI> Justice, these are some of the effects of the priviledges they boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of and cry out for, and are afraid of losing <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> The ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing one another for Justices, and crowding Offices upon one another. And if they have a design to bring to pals '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is But to get a <HI>Quaker</HI> Jury, and their business is done. But on the other hand, if they have any drudgery to do, as trying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or the like, then they'l take a Jury of the worlds people to do it, that they may throw the blame on them, and off of them∣selves, if any thing be done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the case, and this has been their practice at <HI>Burlington.</HI></P>
<P>And at the day of Election, when they have before hand enjoyned their followers who they shall chuse for Assembly men, they cry out to the People, <HI>Stand up for your Priviledges,</HI> That is, to chuse us for Assembly men, for if you chuse the worlds people, you will soon have a Militia to maintain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and you may have Priests to maintain too, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> hurt our cause and draw the People from Truth that is, from us and our cause. And these are same of the Art<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that those who would be thought Loyal Subjects to the King, use to freight and force the poor ignorant people to gratifie their ambition to rule, and for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeding and maintaining this ambition of theirs, they pay them back again by enslaving them with prodigious Taxes, but this [I am told] begins now so to open the eyes of the poor people, as to make them shut their purses, for they now perceive that the Priviledges of <HI>West-Jarsey</HI> that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have so long stood up for and boasted of, is for them to lord it over their neighbours, and command their Purses. But in this road I must travel no further.</P>
