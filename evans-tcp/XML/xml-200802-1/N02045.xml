<HEAD>THE DOCTRINE OF Absolute <HI>REPROBATION</HI> REFUTED.</HEAD>
<P>SEEING there is a Sect of Men, which (I charitably hope) for Want of duly reflecting upon, judiciously weighing, and reve∣rently considering the injurious Conse∣quences and absurd Inferences of the Doctrine of <HI>absolute Reprobation,</HI> accord∣ing to the <HI>Westminster Confession of Faith,</HI> hath entertained the same for Truth, which implies thus much, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That God by an eternal and immutable Decree, hath predestinated to eternal Damna∣tion the far greater Part of Mankind, not considered as made, much less as
<PB N="4" REF="002430_0003_0FDB426D75D7C870"/>
fallen, without any Respect had to their Disobedience or Sin, but only for the demonstrating the Glory of his Ju∣stice; and for the bringing this about, he hath appointed these miserable Souls necessarily to walk in their wick∣ed Ways, that so his Justice may lay hold on them; and that God doth therefore not only suffer them to be liable to this Misery in many Parts of the World, by with-holding from them the, preaching of the Gospel, and Knowledge of Christ, but even in those Places where the Gospel is preached, and Salvation by Christ, is offered; whom, tho' he publickly invite them, yet he justly condemns for Disobedi∣ence, albeit he hath with-held from them all Grace, by which they could have laid hold on the Gospel, <HI>viz.</HI> Because he hath by a secret Will un∣known to all Men, ordain'd and de∣cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, (without any Respect had to their Disobedience or Sin) that they shall not obey, and that the Offer of the Gospel shall never prove affectual
<PB N="5" REF="002430_0004_0FDB426F86D1F4D8"/>
for their Salvation, but only serve to aggravate and occasion their greater Condemnation.</Q> The which Doctrine, when I had seriously pondered, and in the Fear of the Lord solidly weighed and considered it: understanding it to be received for Truth, and boldly promul∣gated by the <HI>Preslyterious,</HI> in this Pro∣vince of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> as also by the <HI>Bap∣tists</HI> in a Catechism printed in <HI>Philadel∣phia</HI>; which briefly comprehends the whole, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That God for a Purpose of his own Glory, hath fore-ordain∣ed whatsoever comes to pass;</Q> I found it incumbent open me to reply to it, both as it is inconsistent with the Truth, and derogatory to the Justice and Mercy of God: As also, if any simple Hearts have received Hurt by it, they may be undeceived.</P>
<P>Something of this Kind has indeed of late been pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>singly touched upon, but (in my Opinion) considering the Tendency and Import of that Doctrine, it is there∣in too easily passed over; and the Absur∣dity and Injuriousness thereof not rendred
<PB N="6" REF="002430_0005_0FDB4272960CAB28"/>
obvious enough, or at least not so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llustrated as it might be, (and I hope profitably) to its poor deluded Believers. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is an amazing Thing to think, how any Men that render to God the Epithets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Just, Righteous, Merciful, Gracious, Long-suffering, Loving, Pitiful, Tender</HI> and <HI>True,</HI> could ever conceive an Opi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion so blasphemous, so injurious, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o opposite to them all; the natural Con∣sequences of which are such as these that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It makes God the Author of Sin, which is of all Things the most disagree∣able to his Nature; it being antipathe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> to his Holiness and Righteousness. And that this is a natural Consequence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Doctrine, is easily proved. For if God (as the <HI>Westminster Confession of Faith, Chap.</HI> 3. saith) "has ordain'd such as are not elected, for Dishonour and Wrath, to the Praise of his glorious Ju∣stice": And again, in the same Chapter, <Q>Nothing future, or what was to come, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as foreseen by God, was the Cause
<PB N="7" REF="002430_0006_0FDB4274383A41B0"/>
of God's Decree:</Q> And if it be only of his own Pleasure that he hath so de∣creed; and if to the End that his Justice may lay hold on them, he hath decreed long before they were in Being, or in a Capacity to do Good or Evil, that they should walk in those wicked Ways, by which Means they should justly be led to that End: Then, they in committing Sin and Wickedness, are fulfilling and ac∣complishing the Will and Decree of God, which then he must be the Author of, seeing it is undeniable, that he is the Au∣thor of all his own Decrees.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is injurious to God, in that it makes him a meer Hypocrite and Dis∣sembler, (<HI>abfit Blasphemia</HI>) when he ut∣ters his Mind in so many seeming seri∣ous and strong Asseverations, Com∣plaints, Commands, and compassionate Compellations; and makes him only to deceive People, and belie himself, when he says,</P>
<Q><P>I have no Pleasure in the Death of
<PB N="8" REF="002430_0007_0FDB4277A162F388"/>
him that dieth. Wherefore turn your selves and live.</P>
<P>As I live, I have no Pleasure in the Death of the wicked; but that the wic∣ked turn from his Way and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil Ways, for why will ye die?</P>
<P>Look unto me, and be ye saved, all ye Ends of the Earth.</P>
<P>Behold my Servant; I have given him a Light to the Nations, to be my Salvation to the Ends of the Earth.</P>
<P>Hearken unto me, and let your Souls delight in Fatness; hear and your Souls shall live.</P>
<P>The Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and let him that is a thirst come; and whosoever will, let him come, and take of the Water of Life freely.</P>
<P>Ho! every one that thirsteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, come; yea come, and buy Wine and Milk, without Money and without Price.</P>
<P>The Son of Man is come to seek out and to save that which is lost.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002430_0008_0FDB42797750B888"/>I am come, that they might have Life abundantly.</P>
<P>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</P>
<P>He hath laid Help upon one that is mighty, who is able to save to the utmost, all that come to God by him.</P>
<P>Him that cometh unto me, will I in no wise cast out.</P>
<P>In the Lord is Compassion, and with him is plenteous Redemption.</P>
<P>Let the wicked forsake his Way, and the unrighteous his Thoughts; and turn to the Lord, for he is gracious; and to our God, for he will abundant∣ly pardon.</P>
<P>He is long suffering; not willing any should perish; but that all should come to Repentance.</P>
<P>Wills that all should be saved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</P>
<P>His tender Mercies are over all his Works.</P>
<P>God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who∣soever
<PB N="10" REF="002430_0009_0FDB427B099D1710"/>
believeth in him, may not pe∣rish, but have everlasting Life.</P>
<P>For he sent not his Son into the World to condemn the World; but that the World through him might be saved.</P>
<P>He that believeth not, makes God a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iar, because he believeth not the Testimony God gives of his Son.</P>
<P>In him is Life, and his Life is the Light of Men: And the Light shineth in Darkness, but the Darkness com∣prehends it not.</P>
<P>He came a Light into the World, but the World knew him not.</P>
<P>This is the true Light which en∣lightens every Man that cometh into the World.</P>
<P>He would have all Men to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, and be saved.</P>
<P>Glory be to God on high, on Earth Peace, and Good Will towards Men,</P>
<P>Glad Tidings of great Joy, which shall be to ALL People.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002430_0010_0FDB427B90B08D70"/>He shall save his People from their Sins.</P>
<P>To you is born a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord, the one Mediator between God and Man,</P>
<P>JESUS who gave himself a Ran∣som for ALL.</P>
<P>Who died for ALL and by the Grace of God tasted Death for every Man.</P>
<P>God commendeth his Love to us, in that when we were Sinners, Christ di∣ed for us.</P>
<P>"Died for the ungodly.</P>
<P>"The Saviour of the World.</P>
<P>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee, as a Hen gathers her Chickens under her Wings, but thou wouldst not.</P>
<P>And the Wisdom of God cries out, How long ye Scorners, will ye de∣light in Scorning, and simple ones love Simplicity, and Fools hate Knowledge?</P>
<P>Turn at my Reproof, I will pour out my Spirit upon you, make known my Words to you. Because I call,
<PB N="12" REF="002430_0011_0FDB427E64188250"/>
and ye refuse; and stretch out my Hands to a rebellious and gainsaying People; and no Man regardeth; but ye set at nought all my Counsel, and will none of my Reproofs; I also will laugh at your Calamity, and mock when your Fear cometh; when your Fear cometh as Desolation, and your Destruction as a Whirlwind, when Distress and Anguish cometh upon you; because ye hated Know∣ledge, and did not chuse the Fear of the Lord. For the turning away of the Simple slays him; but whoso heark∣neth to me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from Fear of Evil.</P></Q>
<P>And a Number more like to these, of solemn Compellations, Complaints, Counsels, Consolations, Compassions, Wishings and Wouldings, Adjurati∣ons, Corrections, Condemnation, In∣treaties, Threatnings, Perswasions, o∣penly poured out to all Men; which yet according to the aforesaid Doctrine (tho' tendred by a true and merciful
<PB N="13" REF="002430_0012_0FDB427F80B82888"/>
God) is only Deceit and Hypocrisy to Millions of miserable Sinners, to whom its never intended, that they ever must be shall come within the Bounds of so much as a Possibility of it; nor have to much as a Liberty allowed them to take or refuse, but be kept down under a cer∣tain Necessity of perishing, contracted to them (as is supposed) from one sin∣gle Sin of one whom they never chose to be their Proxy or Representative of their Persons to God; so as that they should live or die, as he should stand or fall; from whose Loins is derived ine∣vitable Damnation upon all Individuals, that for Want of a sufficient Light and Grace vouchsafed them to lead out of it, to escape it, the most must necessarily, unavoidably, unalterably (as by God's particular private Decree, without Refe∣rence to their final Rejection of God first) Sin from the Womb to the Tomb; that they may, by filling up their Mea∣sure, become Vessels of Wrath sit so Destruction; and upon Account of the personal Decree still concerning them
<PB N="14" REF="002430_0013_0FDB42835E8658A8"/>
not so much as possibly escape the Con∣demnation of Hell.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This makes God a most un∣just and merciless Tyrant, like to, or worse than <HI>Pharaoh</HI> himself, whom he plagued for the self-same Cruelty and Tyranny; even a rigorous Requirer of Men, with many and sore Stripes, yea, on pain of his eternal Wrath and Ven¦geance, to make Bricks without any Allowance at all of Straw, fit for such a purpose; an austere Man, a hard Ma∣ster, a tyrannical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack-Master, (as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ille unprofitable Servant falsly repre∣sented him) that expects to reap where he never sowed, and to gather where he hath not strawed; that calls on Pe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l of for ever perishing, for a Crop of good Works, from those in whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ts he never sowed the good Send o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Word; Fruits of the Spirit, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Souls into whom he never sent his Spirit; from whence only they can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up; and commandeth all Men e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery where to repeat; and yet he
<PB N="15" REF="002430_0014_0FDB428577599228"/>
knows, without him and his Grace, they can do nothing; all their Suffi∣ciency to will and to do, must come from him; This is utterly contrary to the Wisdom of God in Scripture, which justifies him still, as accepting every Man according to what he hath, or hath had; not expecting (much less with Rigour exacting) of any Man ac∣cording to what from him he neither hath, nor ever had; as requiring from Men no otherwise than according to what is committed to them, and re∣quires no more of any Man than Im∣provement of his own Money he com∣mits to him to trade with; which Mo∣ney, if every one put into the Bank, that the Lord at his coming may receive but his own with the Use thereof, and In∣crease in the same Kind of Grace that he freely gives, he will never enter into Judgment with them to Condemnation.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> It renders the Coming, Death and Suffering of Christ ineffec∣tual▪ For if the far greater Part of
<PB N="16" REF="002430_0015_0FDB42870F4539B8"/>
Mankind be by an irrevocable Decree preordinated to eternal Damnation, without any Respect had to any fore∣seen Sin to be committed in Time by them how can the Death and Suffering of Christ be to them beneficial, seeing they are not thereby put into a Capa∣city of Salvation▪ Little Reason then had the Angel to sing (<HI>Gloria in excelsis</HI>) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to God on high, on the Earth Peace, and good Will to Men,</HI> or to say, <HI>I bring you good Tydings of great Joy, which shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be to all People,</HI> if so great a Num∣ber were excluded from any Share or Interest therein; this would make the Message of God by the Angel to all People to be a salacious Lie; seeing he neither intended ALL nor half of them to be in the least Measure benefitted by it; but rather to leave them in the more fore Condemnation. For, tho' he by his Son call and invite ALL, yet ALL can't come, nay not one, except God who calls give them his special, saving and electing Grace; and most, accord∣ing to this Doctrine can never come, be∣cause
<PB N="17" REF="002430_0016_0FDB4287E970D748"/>
God never did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to vouchsafe it to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hath a Reserve in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tain secret Will within himself, not known to Man which runs otherwise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his revealed Will in the Holy Scripture does; even a secret Purpose (which yet, as se∣cret as it is, it seems the Propogators of this Doctrine, as if they had been upon the secret Council of the Almighty, pretend to know it, and must be babling about it, to the shaming and contradic∣ting themselves in the other) to give this Salvation but to a certain small Number, in Comparison of the rest, whom from Eternity he hath reprobated, and purposed personally upon <HI>Adam</HI>'s Score shall go without it; which Sin of that single Person shall so remain on the Score with him for ever, that upon the Account thereof the greatest Part of Mankind, his Posterity, tho' yet he would (in Words) shew himself more rich in Mercy to them all, than severe, to take Advantage against any, so as
<PB N="18" REF="002430_0017_0FDB428B2D95CCC0"/>
to have it told thus in universal Terms, THAT HIS SON DIED FOR THEM ALL, for EVERY Man, the WHOLE World, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) should be left without any Interest or Share in it, or any Potential Title thereunto. And howbeit he will have them all called to come, and lay hold on it, and Promises of Life made to them on Condition they come, and believe in his Son, and his Love to them in him; yet, he so hates them (perso∣nally) before ever born, or doing Good, or Evil, that they shall never from him be sufficiently impowered to come, or believe; nor by him be put into any Capacity to chuse the Life, tho' set before them, as well as the Death; with a CHUSE LIFE THAT YE MAY LIVE; but be left, for Want of a Will set at Liberty, under a Neces∣sity of having the Evil, but cannot chuse the Good; and must therefore either chuse the Evil, or none: And yet if they do not chuse the Good too, that Ad∣vantage shall be taken the more against
<PB N="19" REF="002430_0018_0FDB428C3647A910"/>
them, to double Vengeance on their Heads, for that helpless, unavoidable Fault of refusing the Good; and a Quar∣rel pick'd against them (upon the Ac∣count of the old intended Praeterition) and so double Execution be done upon them, now, as rebellious against the Gospel of God's Grace; whereby he would (in Words, <HI>alias</HI> seemingly, tho' secretly he never would, nor intended it) have saved them: And for not believing in his Son as theirs, when yet he left them locked up (when he call'd to them to believe,) so fast, that he knew they could not answer, and would not so much as unloose them neither, to see if they would accept his Love, believe, repent, and make Use of the Remedy, <HI>Yea</HI> or <HI>Nay</HI>; in whom also, if they had all believed, most of them had (as the Case stood) been deceived, and belie∣ved but a Lie; a Matter that was no such Matter, <HI>viz. That Christ died for every Individual of them,</HI> if they would believe it; and so his Wrath shall abide on them the more heavily for ever; even
<PB N="20" REF="002430_0019_0FDB429000D5BEC0"/>
because they believed not the Testimo∣ny God gave by his Ministers, openly of his Son, that he died for them; whom yet he died not for, but only for a few Elect ones, according to this Doctrine; and so, whereas God says, <HI>He that believeth not the Testimony that God gives of his Son,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> that he gives eternal Life by him to every Man that believeth in him) <HI>makes God a Liar,</HI> if every Man should believe in him, (as they are all bid) and take the Testi∣mony of the Life by him to themselves to be true: Either some must believe a Lie. (since he died not for every Man, but for some only, <HI>as they say</HI>) else their Testimony is a Lie, and they ALL lie, (which is indeed the Truth) who testify that God gave his Son intentionally but for a few, when God's own Testimony of him, is, <HI>That he gave him a Ransom for ALL.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> It is injurious to Christ, in that it renders his Mediation ineffectual, and his Intercession vain: For, if by an
<PB N="21" REF="002430_0020_0FDB4291E6E0F8F0"/>
eternal and immutable Decree a certain Number be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ated to eternal Dam¦nation, what can the Mediation and Intercession of Christ avast them, seeing the Decree is unalterable, and that they must necessarily Sin, and therefore pe∣rish? How consistent this is with the Testimony of the Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, let the Reader judge, <HI>viz. If my Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we have an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te with the Father; Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pi∣tiation for our Sons, and not for ours on∣ly, but also for the Sins of the whole World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> It renders the Preaching of the Gospel a meer Mock and Illusion: For if many of these to whom it is preached be by an irrevocable Decree excluded from being at all priviledged by it, it wholly makes useless the Preaching of Faith and Repentance; and the whole Tenor of the Gospel-Pro∣mises and Threatnings, Wrestlings a∣gainst Sin and Corruption, Fasting, Pray∣er and Humiliation, and all other pious
<PB N="22" REF="002430_0021_0FDB4292F665ACA8"/>
and religious Exercises whatsoever. For they that are under the Decree of Electi∣on, can never miss of Salvation; let their Omissions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Commissions be what they will; All Works to them are use∣less; they need do nothing but wait for that irresistable Juncture which will come, tho' at the last Moment of their Lives: But if they are under the Decree of Reprobation, let their Labours be what they will, they must inevitably undergo eternal Damnation.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> It is injurious to Mankind. For it puts them in a worse Condition than the Devils in Hell. For these were sometimes in a Capacity to have stood; and do only suffer for their own Guilt. But according to this damning and dam∣nable Doctrine, Millions of Men suffer and are for ever tormented for <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, which they were never accessary to, nor in a Capacity to prevent, nor ever knew of. This puts them into the Condition of a Man fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t chain'd, and setter'd in a Dungeon; to whom when
<PB N="23" REF="002430_0022_0FDB4296454E2B68"/>
he is almost starved, one comes near to him with a Dish of Meat in his Left Hand, and a Club in his Right Hand; and standing aloof off from him, says, <Q>;Why wilt thou starve, thou self-mur∣dering Man? come to me, and here is Meat for thee; I am freely willing thou shouldst have it, and not perish, (never coming near to loose him all this while, nor bringing the Meat within his Reach) but if thou wilt not come, I will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t out thy Brains;</Q> and so be∣cause he comes not, when yet he knows he cannot, he runs on him pretending to do just Vengeance on him, for his wil∣ful refusing his own Help, when he might (<HI>alias</HI> never might) have had it; and like a mocking merciless Tyrant, beats out his Brains indeed: which is just the Measure God metes to Men, according to this blasphemous Doctrine. For he that on Pain of Puni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hment, Death and Condemnation if the Terms be not per∣formed, tenders Life and Salvation, on Terms and Conditions utterly impossible to be, or ever to have been performed,
<PB N="24" REF="002430_0023_0FDB429780991B50"/>
by the Person to whom the Tender is, unless a Grace be given him, which ne∣ver shall be, is an arrant Hypocrite, and a merciless Tyrant. And such an one this Doctrine makes God; who yet is no such, (but that it belies him) but just, righteous, merciful, gracious, com∣passionate, long-suffering, pitiful, tender and true; and no Mocker of poor Man∣kind, but truly means and intends as he says, and doth not unjustly and unmer∣cifully tyrannize over them.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> It makes the Publishers of the Gospel to be meet mock Ministers, not worthy of hearing, (seeing they cannot profit the Hearers) much less of feeding, and so richly rewarding; yea, such as thereby make themselves the most hateful Extortioners; and might be ashamed to force Maintenance from Men, for running on such a sleeveless Errand as this is to all Men; for if this Doctrine be true, the Elect shall be sa∣ved without either their Preaching, or any Endeavours of their own▪ But the

Well might God hate such a profane Wretch, that instead of mourning for the Loss of a pious Father, was for killing his Brother, who, (tho' a plain Man) a much better than himself.

<P>And so, next we n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> note, how it came to pass, that <HI>Isaac</HI>'s Prophecy was full lied on the Children of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Esau. Jacob</HI> has allotted to him, and his Seed, <HI>the Dew of Heaven</HI> first, and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of the Earth</HI> afterwards, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.28, 29. but <HI>Esau</HI> the <HI>Fatness of the Earth</HI> first, and <HI>the Dew of Heaven</HI> last, <HI>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 39, 40. This is worth our while to take some special Notice of, because it seems to predict the Conversion of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and breaking of the Yoke of the Ceremonial, or Shadowy Part of the Law. Now the Lord and his Divine Goodness was with <HI>Jacob,</HI> and his Seed; and powerfully wrought for them, in bringing them out of <HI>E∣gypt,</HI> and thro' the Red-Sea, and feed∣ing of them with Angel's Food, or with Manna from Heaven, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.21. du∣ring all which Time, they had but little of the Fatness of the Earth, but the mighty God of <HI>Jacob</HI> was wonderfully with them. While on the other Hand,
<PB N="51" REF="002430_0049_0FDB42CC0E6F01E0"/>
<HI>Esau</HI> was rich and flourishing, and had (as his Father predicted) the Fatness of the Earth, in great Plenty; having di∣vers Kingdoms, and many Dukedoms, <HI>Gen.</HI> 36. about thirteen Kings, and thir∣ty odd Dukes; but we read nothing of their Righteousness, or true worshipping of the God of good <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI>; so that they had the <HI>Fatness of the Earth,</HI> and seem to have prized it above the <HI>Dew of Heaven,</HI> which <HI>Jacob</HI> had first: But that Expression is of great Signification to the Heathen <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that were of the Stock of <HI>Esau,</HI> and points to the Gospel-Day, and Coming of Christ, <HI>viz. When thou shalt have the Dominion, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> break his Yoke from off thy Neck,</HI> Gen. 27.40. which shews forth the Power of the Gos∣pel, and Dominion of Christ, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on∣version of the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; for <HI>Esau</HI>'s S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock according to the Flesh, is some Part of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> are of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s. And now is Salvation offered freely thro' Christ to those <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that are of the Stock of <HI>Esau,</HI> and to all others,
<PB N="52" REF="002430_0050_0FDB42CD814159A0"/>
both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that truly be∣lieve in him, <HI>Acts</HI> 10.34, 35. through∣out all Nations; which caused the <HI>Angel</HI> to sing, <HI>Glory to God on high, Peace on Earth▪ and good Will towards Men,</HI> Luke 2.14. Happy would it be if Men had good Will one towards another, then would they joyn in the High Praises of God, in and thro' the blessed Visita∣tion of his dear Son. And now is the latter Part of that Blessing to <HI>Jacob</HI> ful∣filling, <HI>viz.</HI> the Enjoyment of <HI>the Fat∣ness of the Earth</HI>; for the <HI>Jews</HI> are gene∣rally a rich People, and have great A∣bundance of the Fatness of the Earth; as is evident in all Parts where they are allowed to live and traffick. But the <HI>Dew of Heaven,</HI> the immediate Power and Manifestation of the Presence of God, is much lost as to them, which we have Cause to believe, is for the Hard∣ness of their Hearts, and Unbelief in Christ the Lord, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.20. So that the Blessing of Faith by <HI>Isaac</HI> to his two Sons, and their Posterity, is come to pass, as may plainly be seen with an
<PB N="53" REF="002430_0051_0FDB42CF07882190"/>
Eye of Faith; the which, may our good and gracious Lord open more and more in the Hearts of all People. And may every one that seeth this, truly lay, <HI>A∣men, even so come holy Lord Jesus, come quickly.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, these dark Divines, the Propagators of the aforesaid Doctrine would also grant, if they would once come to the Light of Christ that they might see, that 'tis one Thing to be denominated afore-hand by God (who foreseeing future Events, oft calls those Things which are not, as if they were) loved or hated respectively; before ei∣ther Good or Evil be actually done, or the Doers born, with Reference to the Good and Evil he foresaw would be done in Time; and another to be absolutely and actually loved and hated, not on∣ly without any Reference or Respect to Good and Evil foreseen that it would be done: But also before the Subjects and Doers thereof are as yet in so much as any actual Being: And that these
<PB N="54" REF="002430_0052_0FDB42D0854EA480"/>
two Persons were Types of the two See<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; that (and not Persons, but so) as they are Children of the one or the other, are the only, absolute, everlast∣ing, unchangeable Subjects of God's peremptory, unalterable and eternal Decrees of <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation, viz.</HI> the Seed of the Woman and that of the Serpent; which, the Seed of the Righteous who are ever blessed, and the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of evil Doers who are never to be renowned, are respectively born of, and adhering to. And tho' they will needs misunderstand it as spoken of those Per∣sons only, yet it is not so, but of the two Nations that strove in the Womb of <HI>Rebecca,</HI> Gen. 25.23. and the two Man∣ner of People that were to go forth of her Bowels; <HI>viz. Israel</HI> and <HI>Edom,</HI> which two Nations, (but that what is most right, is mostly a Riddle to them) they might read (as born after the Flesh) were Types yet of a more mystical and Spiritual <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Edom</HI> than they are yet well acquainted with; and that
<PB N="55" REF="002430_0053_0FDB42D336E31A08"/>
God's loving the one, and hating the other of these, was (as is most evident in <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.2, 3, 4.) not without, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Respect to Evil; and not any foreseen Evil already done neither, but on Ac∣count of the wicke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Works and Re∣bellion of <HI>Esau</HI> and his Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terity that walked in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays, (as <HI>Jacob</HI>'s were not) they became the Objects of God's Hatred, and (whilst they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emain in their Rebellion) a People against whom God hath Indignation for ever.</P>
<P>But there was no such Thing as <HI>Ja∣cob have I loved, Esau have I hated,</HI> said of these two single Persons before they were born; for the Text says, that <HI>Be∣fore they had done Good or Evil,</HI> (or were born either) it was said to her, <HI>the elder shall serve the younger,</HI> Rom. 9.11, 12. And it's certainly true, that he did so, both in the single Type and the foresaid double Anti Type. And this is witnessed in the Saints, whom the World knows not, to be Truth at this Day, that the Elder doth serve the younger, which hath been kept under a great
<PB N="56" REF="002430_0054_0FDB42D441994D40"/>
while; but of the other, it's said thus, (not as it was said to her, but) as it is written, <HI>Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated,</HI> ver. 13. And when was this written? Was it before the two Per∣sons of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Esau</HI> were born, or had done either Good or Evil? I trow not, but by <HI>Malachi</HI> the last Prophet, <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.2, 3. whose Time was long af∣ter they had done all the Good and E∣vil they ever did in the Body; yea, Hundreds of Years after both their Dissolutions.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The next under Considera∣tion, is, that <HI>the Lord hardened the Heart of Pharaoh,</HI> Exod. 7.13. (who first harden'd his own Heart against God and his People, and then God harden∣ed him yet harder to shew his great Power to Mortals,) which is true, that he did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter Day of his Visita∣tion was over, and that <HI>Pharaoh</HI> had first hardened his own Heart; so that God was clear of that evil Heart of Unbelief in him; and it is but just,
<PB N="57" REF="002430_0055_0FDB42D6470299F8"/>
and also reasonable, that when Man having been often visited, refuseth the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fers of God's Love, that God visits him in his just and righteous Judgment, when he hath slighted his Mercy, and Grace; and then according to Holy Scripture, his <HI>Destruction is of himself, but his Help is in the Lord,</HI> Hos. 13.9. So that God is true, and every Man (contradicting him) a Lyar, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.4. Wherefore, let all and every Body have a Care of hardning their Heart as <HI>Pha∣raoh</HI> did, for that is provoking to the Almighty; and then he justly gives them over to an evil Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Unbelief, or to a Reprobate Mind, and they depart from the Living God. The Lord said to <HI>Pharaoh, Let my People go,</HI> (over and over) and it was the Mind of God, he should have done it, and he might also have done it if he would, bur he refu∣sed, saying, <HI>Who is the Lord that I should obey his Voice, to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Is∣rael go,</HI> (Exod. 5.2.) and so continued to harden himself against God and his
<PB N="58" REF="002430_0056_0FDB42D8EAB1D710"/>
People, cruelly persecuting and forcing them to make Brick without Straw, un∣til God hardned him yet more. Also, may all hard-hearted and unbelieving People take Warning by him, in Time, before it be too late.</P>
<P>Thus, it's clear, he might have let the People go, because God by <HI>Moses</HI> com∣manded him so to do. It is absurd to think, that God spake one Thing and intended another, therefore it was pos∣sible for him to have done what God required of him, and he was not pre∣destinated to that Obduration, until he hardened his own Heart, and then he was given up to a Reprobate Mind, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.28.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The following Scripture is falsly made Use of, <HI>viz.</HI> Isa 27.11. <HI>He that made them, will not have Mercy on them, and he that formed them, will shew them no Favour.</HI> This Text has been met with in the Writings of some of those that espouse the aforesaid Doc∣trine, adduced to vindicate that Prin∣ciple
<PB N="59" REF="002430_0057_0FDB131C62A5D7B0"/>
of Pre-ordination to Destruction: But it is therein grosly perverted; for in the same Verse, the Cause thereof is fairly stated, and the Reason clearly shewn, <HI>Isa.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.11. <HI>viz.</HI> because they <HI>were withered Branches, and a People of no Understanding, therefore he that made them, would not have Mercy on them; and he that formed them, would shew them no Favour.</HI> So that it's clear they might have been fruitful, but would not, and had been green, but were wi∣ther'd from their Greenness, much like those whom Christ expostulates with, when he says, <HI>How often would I have gather'd you, as a Hen gathers her Chick∣ens under her Wings, but you would not,</HI> (Mat. 23.37. Luke 19.42.) <HI>O that thou had<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t known in this thy Day, the Things that belong to thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes:</HI> Which shews the great and fervent Desire of Christ, and his tender Love to poor Mortals, far from ordaining them to Destruction; so that God and Christ is fully clear
<PB N="60" REF="002430_0058_0FDB42DC737293F8"/>
of the Blood of all Men, and their De∣struction is of themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> They argue from the Words of the Apostle, <HI>Hath not the Potter Power over the Clay, to make of the same Lump one Vessel to Honour, and another to Dishonour</HI>? (Rom. 9.21.) Yes, doubt∣less, he hath; but the Potter doth not make Vessels designedly to break them to Pieces, or to destroy them, but for the Use and Service of his House; and it is an Honour to be the meanest Ves∣sel in the House of God, tho' some Vessels are more honourable than others; and if the Vessel mar in the Hand of the Potter, it is not the Fault of the Pot∣ter, but of the Clay, as we have it in the Instance of the Prophet, concern∣ing <HI>Israel, Jer.</HI> 18.4. And the Lord in his Wisdom, and to shew his Power, doth make Souls more or less honoura∣ble, as he pleaseth; but 'tis plain, he makes none with Design to destroy them, both from Scripture and right Reason.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="002430_0059_0FDB42E04A3119B0"/><HI>Fifthly,</HI> They urge the Apostle's Words, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.18. but to as little Pur∣pose as the former, <HI>He will have Mer∣cy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will be hardeneth.</HI> 'Tis true; God hath abandantly shewn us in the Ho∣ly Scriptures on whom he will have Mercy, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><L>He hath Mercy on the Poor.</L>
<L>The humble he teacheth of his Ways.</L>
<L>Guides the Meek in Judgment.</L>
<L>Cloaths the Meek with Salvation.</L>
<L>Hath the Righteous in everlasting Remembrance.</L>
<L>Loves them which loves him.</L>
<L>Saves them who loves his Son, and be∣lieves in him; <HI>and</HI> gives to them ever∣lasting Life.</L></Q>
<P>And Christ loves them, and manifests himself unto them; and wills not to harden any but the Wicked and ungod∣ly, and such who slight their own Mer∣cy, and neglect their own Salvation;
<PB N="62" REF="002430_0060_0FDB42E1BB8B35B8"/>
and are malicious and uncharitable, per∣securing and unmerciful; but the <HI>mer∣ciful shall obtain Mercy,</HI> as saith Christ, in his most excellent Sermon which he preached upon the Mount, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.7. well worth the often reading and peru∣sing of all professing the Name of Jesus Christ. There was never any Sermon in all the World, preached by any Man since the Creation, like that of Christ's. And now, all who make a Profession of the holy Name of Jesus, are desir'd and entreated to take a View of the Lives and Conversations of People, for with those who walk most consonant to the Doctrine of our blessed Saviour, they may most safely joyn in Communion and Fellowship, and in the Worship of the Father and the Son with them. But 'tis of dangerous Consequence to join with those that walk, and talk, and be∣lieve contrary thereto.</P>
<P>Thus it was in my Mind, and hath been for some Years, to shew to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> People, the Weakness of some of their own Proofs, (as they ima∣gine
<PB N="63" REF="002430_0061_0FDB42E584FB7B70"/>
them) and strongest Arguments for this corrupt Doctrine of theirs; and their Misapplication of those Texts of Scripture, which they advance, to main∣tain their absurd Notion of particular and personal Election and Reprobation of Souls to eternal Destruction and Damnation, before they were born, or having done either Good or Evil, that they might come to true Repentance, add lay hold on eternal Life, thro' Je∣sus Christ our Lord, and dwell in the Sense of the universal Love of God and Christ to all Mankind; in the tender Bowels thereof, to all those of the <HI>Pres∣byterian, Independent or Baptist</HI> Perswa∣sion, or any other who hold the afore∣said gross Error, are those Lines writ∣ten; and in great Love and Tenderness, they are invited to search the Scriptures, and see whether the whole Scope of them do not shew the contrary, and wonderfully and excellently set forth the Love and Goodness, Grace and Mer∣cy of God and Christ to poor Mortals.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="002430_0062_0FDB42E627F3C0B0"/>Oh that People might lay hold of it, and come to Christ, that they might have Life; for tho' it is Good to search the Scriptures, 'tis better to come to Christ. A Man may search the Scrip∣tures, and not come to Christ as the <HI>Jews</HI> did, <HI>John</HI> 5.39.40. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a Man come rightly to Christ, he will not be negligent in searching the Scriptures, for they contain rich Treasure to the seeking Soul. And <HI>they are able thro' Faith</HI> in Christ Jesus, <HI>to make the Man of God wise to Salvation,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.15. And what is therein clear to the Un∣derstanding, <HI>That</HI> lay hold of, embrace, and put in Practice: But be careful not to meddle with what is obscure to thy Understanding; for there is enough there∣in which is plain and apt to most States and Conditions. And if thou wantest any Thing for thy Soul, which thou canst not readily find Satisfaction about in the Scriptures; then I advise thee, in the Love of Christ, to seek to him, who is near every true seeking Soul. <HI>He is not far away from every one of you,</HI> saith
<PB N="65" REF="002430_0063_0FDB42E79B67DA98"/>
the Apostle, <HI>Acts,</HI> 17.27. He is in the true Believers <HI>the Hope of Glory,</HI> as saith the Scriptures.</P>
<P>Wherefore, O tender Soul, come to Christ, pour out thy Soul to him, make thy Complaint to him; He being the <HI>Good Samaritan,</HI> the great Physician of Value, will in his own Time (if thou continue in well doing) help and heal thee. Do not let in that dangerous Principle, that thou art predestinated to De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>truction; for that is a dangerous Snare of the Enemy; and many Souls have been lost thro' that deceitful, dark Doctrine, being thereby doubting and fearful of Damnation, and ready thus to express themselves; <Q>It is in vain for me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rive, to seek or to pray; for I fear I am a Vessel of Wrath and predestinated to Damnation; for I have no Heart to any good Thing, and am so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely buffeted by Satan.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="002430_0064_0FDB42E9A691A840"/>Oh Soul! In Order that thou mayest be disentangled from this Snare and Stratagem of Satan, is the foregoing written, in Christian and tender Love to thy Soul.</P>
