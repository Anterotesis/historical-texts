<P>SENSIBLE that every attempt at improve∣ment in any of the useful arts, ever has, and probably ever will meet with opposition, either from interested or <HI>certain</HI> other motives, which in a greater or less degree in∣fluence the generality of mankind,—the subscriber takes the liberty to cite a few among very many cases in which his method of removing pains, inflammations, and spas∣modic affections from the human body, has been attend∣ed with success. The novelty and apparent simplicity of this practice, may possibly induce some, before they have attended with candor to the subject, to treat it with ridi∣cule. That the public may be more satisfactorily infor∣med as to its utility and importance, he publishes the fol∣lowing certificates, as received from several respectable characters.</P>

<HEAD>GEN. TYLER, AND MR. LORD.</HEAD>
<P>I JOHN TYLER, of Preston, in the country of New-London and State of Connecticut, hereby certify, that on or about the 17th day of June last, I was con∣fined by a <HI>Wound,</HI> which I had before that time receiv∣ed, by <HI>cutting my right leg transversely,</HI> in which I had taken cold; and at that time the sore was in a high state of inflammation, and gave me great pain, to such a de∣gree that I had been obliged to keep my leg in a hori∣zontal position, in a chair, the most of that day,—when Doct. <HI>Elisha Perkins,</HI> of Plainfield, called on me, and having operated on me a few minutes with his patent metallic instruments, the pain in my leg wholly ceased, and the redness and inflammation of the wound entirely disappeared. I was free from pain that night, and indeed the pain and inflammation both ceased from that opera∣tion, and never returned again.</P>
<P>And I further certify, that my wife at that time was sorely afflicted with rheumatic pains in her hip, which had been upon her a number of years, and had affected her to such a degree as to render that side shorter than the other, and to make her unable at that time to raise herself from her chair without the greatest difficulty, or to walk across the room without learning on her staff, and with that support, not without the greatest inconvenience; and Doct. <HI>Perkins</HI> operated upon her a few minutes, when she declared herself free from pain, and immediately rose from her chair, without any assistance or apparent difficul∣ty, and walked several times across the room without her

<P>I NATHAN GLOVER, of Plainfield, in the county of Windham and state of Connecticut, certify, that for seven years past, I have been frequently visited with severe turns of the <HI>Quinsey,</HI> which (notwithstanding the application of internal and external means, adminis∣tered by the most skilful neighboring physicians) have never lest me within eight or ten days.</P>
<P>About the first of July, 1796, I was again severely at∣tacked by this disease, and in about twenty-four hours, my throat became very much swelled and inflamed, and extremely painful. I was at this time visited by Doct. <HI>Perkins,</HI> who operated on the diseased part, with his pa∣tent metallic instruments.</P>
<P>The pains after two or three operations, wholly left me, and the inflammation entirely disappeared; the swelling did not maturate and break as it had usually done,—but in about twenty-four hours wholly subsided, and my throat became perfectly well.</P>

<P>I CERTIFY, that in the course of my practice, a few months past, I have made frequent experiments with Doctor <HI>Perkins's</HI> patent instruments, and have with but very few exceptions, succeeded to my great aston∣ishment, removing <HI>rheumatic pains, head-achs, agues in the face, cramp-convulsions, and inflamatory swellings of the throat.</HI></P>
<P>The pains after being once eased, have in but few in∣stances returned; and then by a repetition of the oper∣ation, have been wholly removed.</P>
<P>From my own practice, and from what I know of the practice of others, I esteem Doctor <HI>Perkins's</HI> method of removing pains, a very important and useful improve∣ment in the <HI>healing art;</HI> and wish that his instruments may be generally dispersed, that mankind at large may have it in their power by these simple means, to ease themselves of most of the bodily pains which so many experience.</P>

<P>I THE subscriber was called on the 4th instant, to attend a patient, by the name of <HI>James Crawson,</HI> who for the term of nearly five years, has been frequently
<PB N="8" REF="032669_0008_0FF401CBCC2B6AE0"/>
trouble with a <HI>species of epileptic fits.</HI>—When I first saw him, he had experienced in the course of the day, about twelve, each of which usually held him nearly fifteen mi∣nutes. At the commencement of one of them, I took from him about fourteen ounces of blood; but discov∣ering no happy effect, I applied Doctor <HI>Perkins'</HI> patent metallic instruments to his right leg, in which he usually experienced the first attack of his fits. The whole leg immediately became limber and free from spsams, and he soon revived without suffering a general convulsion. About twenty minutes after, I being out of his room, was informed that the symptoms of another fit appear∣ed, and before I could operate on him, he was universally convulsed with an entire loss of reason. I then applied the instrument to his right leg, six or eight strokes, when the spasms immediately ceased, and he recovered his rea∣son. In a short time, he was seized with another, which was removed very much in the manner of the last, the in∣struments not being applied until a general convulsion had taken place. I then seated myself on his bed, that I might be enabled to apply the means more seasonably. Here I very soon discovered the symptoms again, but by applying the instruments, the symptoms immediately disappeared. Several others at intervals, commenced with their usual symptoms, by so contracting and cramp∣ing the right leg, that the utmost exertions of two men were scarcely able to straighten it, each of which were, in less then a minute removed by five or six strokes of the instruments, before they had extended to the other parts of the body, the leg almost instantaneously be coming perfectly lax.</P>
<P>By the request of a number of gentlemen, who were then present, when the symptoms of one appeared, I ceased to operate, that we might determine whether the above operations had prevented the general convulsions, which before the applications of the instruments, had always succeeded the first attack in his leg. Immedi∣ately he fell into a severe fit, which appeared in one uni∣versal spasm. In this situation, I suffered him to conti∣nue a few minutes, when by applying the instruments to
<PB N="9" REF="032669_0009_0FF401CEC87A1310"/>
his leg again, in less than one minute he was entirely free from any kind of spasm, and imme∣diately recovered his reason. I still continued by his side, and prevented several other general attacks by opera∣ting with the instruments at the beginning of the symp∣toms. About one hour and a half after the first opera∣tion, the fits entirely subsided. He became easy and ex∣perienced none of those disagreeable sensations, which he ever had after former attacks of this kind. He informs that he had usually been afflicted with these fits except at a few intervals, about twenty four hours from the time they first commenced, and it is presumed the application of the metallic instruments, not only shortened the fits, but lessened their number, as at this time they continued not more than nine or ten hours from their first com∣mencement, and about an hour and a half after the first application of the instruments. He further observes, that he has discovered none of that debility which had universally succeeded his former attacks, and continues to this day enjoying better health than usual.</P>

For the two last years it has gradu∣ally increased till it became very distressing, and has been attended with a stiffness, to such a degree that I could not raise my hand to the top of my head without great difficulty.

one John Patterson. He had been in this Poor House for six months with the Rheumatism—Two months of which he was confined to his bed—Four months he had hobbled about with crutches, when Dr. Perkins per∣formed the operation; since which he has thrown aside his crutches, and walks only with a staff, which he uses, not for the Rheumatism, for he has none, but merely for a support, as his thigh bone was then and still re∣mains dislocated.</P>
<P>Nancy Blake was also cured, by the Doctor, of the Rheumatism in the small of her back, which had con∣stantly afflicted her for more than three years. It has not returned yet.</P>
<P>Benjamin Ross I cured myself of the Rheumatism in the small of his back and hip. This was ten days ago; it has not returned.</P>
<P>Lewis Dumeth, a Frenchman, was operated upon by the Doctor, for the Rheumatism in his lower extremi∣ties, which had confined him to his bed and crutches for months: but no sooner was he operated upon than he threw aside his crutches—walked about the house—has walked about the town since, and has had no return of the Rheumatism in either leg.</P>
