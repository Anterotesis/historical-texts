<HEAD>A Letter from a Gentle∣man in <HI>Mount Hope,</HI> to his Friend in <HI>Treamount.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot easily Express the Great Joy, and Uni∣versal Satisfaction the People in our Parts ma∣nifested, when they heard some Gentlemen of <HI>Boston,</HI> purposed to Meet, Advise, and Con∣sult of proper Ways and Means, to Extricate you and us, out of our almost Insupportable Difficul∣ties and Oppressions, daily and insensibly, increasing upon us, for want of a Sufficient Medium of Trade and Commerce. — And I freely confess, I was pleased at it, and almost perswaded to believe, that some Good would come of it: But our hopes (being built on a sandy Foundation) soon fell away; our Rejoycing ceased, and we were reduced to our former Melancholy Views: and upon the arrival of your Last Weeks Gazette, we were (<HI>Even to a Man,</HI>) wonderfully surprized, and filled with just Indigna∣tion and Scorn, upon the first Reading an <HI>Infamous Advertisement,</HI> cramm'd into that Gazette, <HI>Pub∣lished by Authority</HI>; in which the Shameless Author, takes upon him an uncommon freedom (not to call it impudence,) to Ill-Treat Villify, a Reverend and Worthy Gentleman, whom we ever deemed a true and faithful Friend to his Country, and who shew'd
<PB N="2" REF="002228_0002_0FDB18FDBA448CB8"/>
himself to be such an One, some Years past, when many Others (considering their Stations in Govern∣ment,) were under stricter Obligations to appear, were afraid to be Gap-men, and protest against the Gross Injuries, Arbitrary and Illegal Actions of the then Go∣vernment: and because he stood up for the Laws and Rights of his Country, he was sent to Goal, and Sus∣pended from his Ministry, fined <HI>Fifty Pounds,</HI> paid Cost, and gave l. 1000. Security for his Good Behavi∣our, for one Year: &amp; we still conceive the same thoughts of him; &amp; by what we have Read in his late Well Digested Treatise, we presume, he endeavour'd after the Ad∣vancement of the Publick Weal and Prosperity of his Native Country, notwithstanding all the Disingenious Flurts, and Invidious Scoffs, of the <HI>Castle-William Writer, who</HI> (<HI>no doubt of it,</HI>) rais'd and mustered, all the Force and Strength he could Command, at that <HI>Fortress,</HI> (tho' to worse than no purpose,) to batter down, and raze the well-grounded Arguments, and reasonable Propositions, so well laid down, and properly Displayed by that Worthy Person, that his Thundering Cannon made no Impression thereon: yet he Conceits in his own brains, that for his Under∣taking so desperate an Affair, he is highly worthy of some Extraordinary Reward; and remarkable Distinction, to be put upon him: having fully demon∣strated his <HI>high Ambition,</HI> as all well Disciplin'd Sol∣diers do, to Serve his <HI>Superior Officer,</HI> to the ut∣most of his Valour and Conduct: and if his Strong Efforts have not attained those Noble Ends, they were so secretly Contrived for, it is a Misfortune that sometimes attends the best of Designs, and there∣fore he is satisfying himself, that his Good Will may meet with some Kind Acceptance.</P>
<P>But, if Men for Projecting Schemes, and finding out Expedients for the Ease of the People, must be brought on the Stage, Maligned, and all that is
<PB N="3" REF="002228_0003_0FDB18FF4642FF30"/>
naught laid o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, and they know not by whom▪ I fear our Circumstances will mend, like Sowre Ale in Summer; so that if any of your Town should argue and say, Surely if there were such a want of a further Supply, or Medium in the Country-Towns, as some Men give out there is, there would have been several from thence, to have made Known their Wants, at the <HI>Late Convention of Gentlemen</HI> in Or∣der for Redress: but none appearing at the time and place, is next to a Mathematical Demonstration, that they have a sufficiency.</P>
<P>Sir, If you find such Arguments like to prevail, you may assure all you Converse with, from me, that the main, if not the only reason, why you had not a considerable Number of Men from, and about our parts, to attend <HI>Last Tuesday Evening,</HI> fur∣nished with Draughts, such as we were capable of framing, was, least their weak Essays, if they did not please <HI>some few among you,</HI> and got into their hands, (as Unavoidably they would,) that then, their plain, honest, well-meaning Attempts would serve to <HI>fill up the next Gazette,</HI> with Opprobrious In∣vectives against them: If not their Names and Per∣sons handled, with the same Scurrillity the late Gen∣tleman was entertained with, upon the like Occasion: for how can we Expect to fare better than he? When the most we are able to offer, must needs come far short of what he put forth on that head.</P>
<P>Verily, should we <HI>Honest Rusticks</HI> be Condemned, and hung up without any <HI>Tryal,</HI> in such an Indecent, and Unmanly Way; I am prone to think Our <HI>Eng∣lish Stomachs,</HI> would not Digest such Filthy Trash. And what very much aggravates this matter, and car∣ries with it Deep Resentments, is, (If we are rightly Inform'd) that every one that belongs to, and resides at the Place where this NOBLE atchievement took its Birth, are maintain'd at the Charge of this Province;
<PB N="4" REF="002228_0004_0FDB1900C27CC3B8"/>
daily receive, and Eat their Bread; and Twice a Year at Least, send in their <HI>Muster Rolls,</HI> and Each Man paid his full Due, and some very <HI>Extravagant Mus∣ter Rolls</HI> (to say no worse of them) from thence were found out and Detected by the House of Re∣presentatives in the Last Session; as appears by their Votes and Just Representation thereof. Now Good Sir, had you &amp; I, and the Generality of the Inhabitants within this Government, the same Opportunities and Ways, (and would improve them,) of being furnish∣ed with <HI>Province Bills</HI> as the Officers and Soldiers at <HI>Castle William</HI> have, we might then se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bly say, and truly Affirm, that for our parts we have enough. But alas! you know, we nor the Generality of the Good People, have no Salleries, Gratuities, or Wages to receive from Mr. Treasurer, but are Oblig'd an∣nually to pay into the Treasury, very Considerable Rates and Taxes, to Support the Government: all which <HI>hitherto</HI> we have cheerfully comported with; and no small part of what we pay in, goes out for the Sole Use and Benefit of the <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> in the Governments pay: So that for any of <HI>that Or∣der of Men,</HI> to think to bring into Contempt any, for their Free and Voluntary Enterprizes, and Con∣trivances to find out proper Expedients, to enable the Prudent and Laborious, the better to pay their Publick Dues, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their necessary Affairs, for the Subsistance of their Wives, and Children, is hard∣ly tollerable: who instead of acknowledging the <HI>Generosity</HI> of the People towards them, start up to pull down and ruin their <HI>Benefactors</HI>; the Law of Gratitude is one of the Laws of Nature: <HI>The Ox knows his Owner, and the Ass his Masters Crib.</HI> But these things we cannot account for: nor ought they to be Countenanced in any Civilized Govern∣ment, and are a Reflection <HI>New-England</HI> was never Tainted with before.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002228_0005_0FDB1903ADBC2528"/>However, Let us amidst our heavy Pressures and Perplexities, Keep up our <HI>true English Spirits</HI> and Fortitude, laying fast hold on our <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Liber∣ties,</HI> as being our <HI>best Refuge,</HI> and most effectual way, in due time to bring us to rights again; for tho' some loss and damage may accrue to our Estates, by reason of the decay of Business and Traffick, yet that may and will revive; but if we once come to be depressed in our Spirits, it will prove far more fatal; and tend to the ruin of our Country, and the loss of our Native Rights. And should our Inconveniences continue growing still more and more upon us, and so far get the Mastery over us, as to bring us into Dispondences, we should soon Groan under the fatal Consequences of such a Calamity.</P>
<P>Let us therefore in <HI>no Wise,</HI> cherish or harbour such <HI>Pussill-animity</HI> within our Breasts; but put far from us, all such despicable thoughts. And if there be <HI>any</HI> among us, who would <HI>rejoyce</HI> to see such days here, I hope they will be <HI>Disappointed,</HI> and know of a Truth, that <HI>New-England-Men,</HI> cannot abide to be drove; or long led by the Nose: and (methinks) if we but look back and Recapitulate the many hardships (almost coming up to the Egypti∣an Bondage,) which this People <HI>not many Years since</HI> were Grovelling under: and the Province put under the Administration of a <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Coun∣cil,</HI> who sought out so many Intentions to plague and hamper the Inhabitants withal; raise upon us Taxes without an Assembly, Declare our Good and Wholsom Laws, to be but a <HI>Nose of Wax,</HI> to serve their Unrighteous turns: and the then <HI>Governour</HI> being abetted, and assisted by the artful Contrivances, and Wicked Insinuations of <HI>some</HI> of his Council, (and <HI>they this Country Men born too,</HI>) to fill his and their Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers by <HI>Filthy Lucre,</HI> gave out, that forsooth, we had no manner of Right or Pretence to our Lands
<PB N="6" REF="002228_0006_0FDB10D7D084C668"/>
and Houses, for that they all belonged to the Crown; but yet in <HI>Pitty</HI> and <HI>Compassion,</HI> if they would take Pattents from <HI>Him,</HI> (which were not attainable with∣out considerable Sums of Money,) <HI>be</HI> would secure them, in their Possessions; and the more plausibly to draw Men into this Gainful (tho' sordid) Projecti∣on, <HI>some of our own Country Men,</HI> and <HI>Councellors,</HI> were the <HI>First</HI> that took up of his Patents; which proved a great Snare to several, and prevailed upon them to part with their Money, rather than have Writts of Intrusion brought against them; which they were continually threatned with, and had just reason to Conclude, if they lost not their Lands, they would be <HI>Sadled</HI> with heavy Bills of Cost, which they must discharge or go to Goal.</P>
<P>The Oppressions, and Grievances that our Fathers lay under, during that Government are too many and too Gross really (some of them,) to recount now: and yet they held out, and surmounted those In∣numerable Calamities: And shall <HI>We</HI> of <HI>their Race</HI> and <HI>Posterity</HI> (even before some of them, have their Heads laid in the Grave,) especially under such a happy <HI>Constitution</HI> as we now Live and Breath in; shall <HI>we</HI> seem in the least to be dismayed for our petty Troubles compared with theirs? Surely no. Have not the People, by our <HI>present Constitution,</HI> the Sole Power and Liberty to Choose <HI>only such,</HI> to represent them, as will on all fit Occasions, boldly assert, and maintain their <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Immunities</HI>; and at all Times sincerely promote the Publick Weal and Tranquility of their <HI>Constituants</HI>? And may they not avoid all, who for the sake of <HI>Perferments,</HI> or fear of loosing a <HI>Place</HI> or <HI>Pension,</HI> will Change their former Notes, and <HI>turn</HI> Courtiers? And if Publick Spirited Men are Chosen to represent the People, will it not be their principal Aim and Bent, that the <HI>Council-Board</HI> be filled up with <HI>such</HI> Gen∣tlemen,
<PB N="7" REF="002228_0007_0FDB190A31F8C538"/>
who laying aside all <HI>Private Gain</HI> in their Publick Stations, and Administration, will joyn hand in hand with the Representative Body, in serving and advancing the Good, and Prosperity of this People? Tho' perhaps some of the Methods to attain that End, should not <HI>Immediately</HI> advance their <HI>Private Inte∣rest,</HI> but in some measure rather Impede and Obstruct it. Upon the whole, If this Province is brought un∣der such Streights and Difficulties, which if not quick∣ly Removed will prove pernicious to it, we must thank our selves, if an effectual Remedy be not found out and applyed, for the Removal of them.</P>
<P>Cannot we <HI>yet</HI> see, what <HI>Obstructions</HI> and <HI>Blocks</HI> are laid in our Way? Who are the Actors and Mana∣gers of the Scene? They appear in as full, and Open view to us, as the Stars in a clear Frosty Night, not∣withstanding the Various and Changeable <HI>Masks</HI> they Cover their Faces with, and pretty fashionable, plausi∣ble <HI>Attire</HI> they appear <HI>of Late</HI> in: Therefore our Way is short and plain; and if we <HI>Now</HI> set out in the right path; I hope before <HI>May next be wholly Expired,</HI> we shall have got almost to our Journey's End, and shall then <HI>Once more</HI> have this Province disengaged from its <HI>present Incumberances,</HI> and the Industrious well minded Man freed from the Jaws of the <HI>Oppress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI> I shall add no more at present, but Subscribe my self as really I am;</P>
