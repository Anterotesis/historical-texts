The Visiting Governors, Physicians, and Surgeons, are allowed to take out Books, at the Hours of their Attendance, on Tues∣days and Fridays, and at the customary Hours on other Days.</P>
<P>VIth. The Librarian is not authorized to let out Books to any Person, save the Governors, Physicians, Surgeons, Apothecary, and House-Surgeon of the Hospital, and to such Students of Medicine as are regularly admitted, agree∣able to the Rules of the Honse, to see the Practice thereof, (except as herein after provided.)</P>
<P>VIIth. The Governors, Physicians, and Surgeons, may take out a complete Work, even if it consist of several Volumes,—but are not allowed this Liberty in respect to voluminous Collections of distinct Papers, such as the Medical Commentaries, &amp;c. of which they can take but a single Volume at a Time.</P>
<P>VIIIth. No Student of Medicine can take out more than one Volume of any Work at a Time.</P>
<P>IXth. Folios may be kept our four Weeks, Quartos three, and Duodecimos two Weeks.</P>
<P>Xth. No Person can take out a Work, or a single Volume of a Work, without leaving with the Librarian a Deposit (to be specified in the Catalogue, for each Work) of not less than one Third more than the actual Value of the Work. This Rule does not extend to certain Medical Collections, hereafter enumerated, in respect to which the Deposit shall have Relation only to the Volume taken out.</P>
<P>XIth. The Librarian shall make a regular Entry, at the Time of loaning any Work, of its Title, Volume, Borrower, and of the Deposit made. He shall also make a like regular Entry of the Time when it is returned, and at the Time of its being returned.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="027406_0025_0FD5CC9BC0C89B78"/>
XIIth. A Shilling a Week shall be paid for every Volume kept beyond the Time herein specified. If the Volume be not returned within three Months, it is to be considered as lost, and the Deposit is forfeited to the Library.</P>
<P>XIIIth. If any Person shall lose a Volume or Volumes of any Set of Books, the Remains of the Set shall be delivered to him, on his substituting a new Set. In Case this be not done, his Deposit is forfeited, and the mutilated Set is also retained in the Library.</P>
<P>XIVth. Damages of Books are of four Degrees,—
<LIST>
<ITEM>[<HI>a</HI>] The defacing the external Appearance of the Book;</ITEM>
<ITEM>[<HI>b</HI>] The destruction or considerable Injury of the Covering;</ITEM>
<ITEM>[<HI>c</HI>] Blots, Spots, and small Rents, &amp;c.—so as to deface, but not destroy, the Contents of the Book;</ITEM>
<ITEM>[<HI>d</HI>] And, the tearing, so as to endanger or occasion the Loss of some Part of the Contents.—</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>When any Damage, short of destroying its Value, happens to a Book, the Librarian is to notice and report it to the Visiting Governors, who are to determine the Fine to be paid by the Borrower—according to the Degree and Nature of the Injury and the Cost of the Book.—The Deposit is to be retained till the Fine is paid. If the Borrower refuses to pay the Fine, the Deposit is forfeited.</P>
<P>XVth. All Fines and Forfeitures are to be appropriated to the Use of the Library. The Librarian is to keep an exact Account of the same, which he is to render Monthly to the Visiting Governors, and pay the Sums so collected to their Order.</P>
<P>XVIth. The Librarian is responsible for the Library, agreeable to the Ca∣talogue, and shall render a semi-annual (or, if it be required, more frequent) Account thereof, to the Governors.</P>
<P>XVIIth. In all Cases where Doubts arise respecting a Violation of the foregoing Rules, they shall be submitted to the Visiting Governors, or the
<PB N="28" REF="027406_0026_0FD5D2B09A8ED7E8"/>
attending Physicians, and Surgeons, whose Determination shall be final: but no such Governors, Physicians, and Surgeons, shall judge in his own Case.</P>
<P>XVIIIth. Any Person making a Donation of Twenty-five Dollars, for the Benefit of the Library, or of Books, connected with Medicine, to that Amount, shall be entitled, during Life, to the Use of the whole Collection, agreeable to the foregoing Rules.</P>
