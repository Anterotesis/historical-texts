<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO publish a Work with the Title borne by this, may, per∣haps, by some, be thought presump∣tion, when it is recollected that Madame de Genlis has already oc∣cupied the Dramatic line, in a man∣ner to be imitated by few, and, probably, to be equalled by none.—But a comparison of this work with the Theatre of Education, of that great Author, would be un∣fair as to execution, and unjust as to design.—The Writer of this Work does not, like Madame de Genlis, intend her Dramatic Dia∣logues to be performed; well a∣ware that the length of the Scenes, in some places, and the simplicity of the Plot in all, would render them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lat and heavy in representa∣tion. The motives by which she was induced to throw her Stories
<PB REF="034381_0003_0FFF0B15524D4998"/>
into Dialogue, were a belief that young people are easily captivated and interested by this manner of writing, and the convenience of a∣voiding the <HI>"said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,"</HI> and <HI>"re∣plied she,"</HI> which becomes so fa∣tiguing in a narration of any length, and which she was so often obli∣ged to break in her last work.</P>
<P>This short explanation the Au∣thoress thought due to herself, lest she should be suspected of endeav∣ouring to imitate one of the first Authors the Age has produces.</P>
<P>If these simple Dialogues should be considered as an additional bar∣rier against the encroachments of Error, and an additional support to the efforts of Virtue, the Writer will be most happy; and she trusts them, tho' not without fear, yet not without hope, to the candour of a generous Public, who at least will give her credit for purity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>

<P>I left her here at her tambour frame—She said she would work while I read to her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Miss, but some∣thing has gone wrong since that.—Here I found the frame, and there lay the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks—Truly, I'm glad I was not here, they'd have been thrown at my head.</P>

<P>Perhaps she is gone to her own room, I'll seek her; if she comes here in the mean time, Mary tell her I am up stairs.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Miss, to be sure I will.—(<HI>Paulina goes out.</HI>)—Ah! by my truth, there's some pleasure in doing any thing for you, one does not get pinched and called names!—So here's the Governess, yawning as usual, but just up.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, Ma'am, not I, she is in one of her passions to-day; every thing goes wrong with her; she was ready to fight with the looking-glass, while I dressed her this morning, and I don't know how many pinches I got for not being quick enough to please her.</P>

<P>Well, Mary, go and tell her to come to me, I want her to read.</P>

<P>Yes, I'm a going, so miss asked me to play wi' she, for she said his honour was gone out and Madam Selwyn wa'nt up, and Master Charles was gone to school, and Miss Paulina was up stairs, and she did not know what to do wi' herself.</P>

all that, you are greatly to be piti∣ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you are the only person (except my father) who e∣ver speaks to me as if I had com∣mon sense!—Mary shrugs up her shoulders and leaves me as soon as she can.—Mrs. Selwyn laughs at me and treats me like a baby.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly Mrs. Sel∣wyn does not treat you properly, but that does not justify you. You are now, my dear, more than twelve years old; at that age, though children, we are no longer babies, but you do not seek to improve yourself. You read, indeed, be∣cause you love reading, but not
<PB N="19" REF="034381_0013_0FFF0A4627F77DB8"/>
with a steady view to your own improvement, and almost all the remainder of your time is spent in dressing your doll and playing with Fanny Wood, who is too ignorant to be a proper companion for you; thus you tempt others to treat you like a baby.—I do not offend you?</P>

<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Juliet, I wish you a better example;—if you were with us, mama would soon teach you to be all your friends could wish.—But Juliet, with the understanding nature has given you, you may do much for yourself. In the words of a very great author I will tell you that
<Q><PB N="20" REF="034381_0014_0FFF0B2A026C5C80"/>
<L>—"There is no soul</L>

<L>Or but allay the Fire of Passion!"—</L></Q></P>
</SP>
<P>Read more, and reflect.—When∣ever you find yourself getting an∣gry leave the cause of your dis∣pleasure, take a book which amu∣ses you, and read till you find your∣self calm and easy. Struggle with your violent passions, and think to what dreadful consequences they will lead if you indulge them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequences!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear cousin, I know not to what an excess they may transport you in time, if they are not now opposed.—My mother told me, the other day, she had just read the history of a man, who, when a boy, squeezed his squirrel to death
<PB N="21" REF="034381_0014_0FFF0B2A026C5C80"/>
as you did your bird, and when he grew up, after various crimes, be∣ing angry with his wife, his child, who was in her arms, happened to cry while he was speaking and, in a fit of passion, he laid his hand on it, and strangled it in a moment!</P>
</SP>

<P>Oh! Heaven, how shocking; do you think it <HI>possible,</HI> Paulina, do you think it <HI>possible</HI> I should ever do so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible to say to what extravagance passion may lead!—But yesterday you would have detested the idea of injuring your bird—and are we not told i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Bible, that when the Prophet foretold to Hazael<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 8th Chapter of the 2d Book of Kings.</NOTE> the miseries he would bring on his country, and the cruelties of which he would be

guilty, he exclaimed, "Is thy ser∣vant a <HI>dog</HI> that he should do this <HI>great</HI> thing?"—And yet when he gave way to his passions, he exactly verified the Prophet's words.</P>

<P>I cannot help loving her, though she is sometimes so much out of the way. She was a sweet child before she grew so passionate, and she has a great deal of good about her still.

<P>Had it pleased Hea∣ven to spare Mrs. Beecher, Juliet would probably have been a very

<P>I see it with pain. She has no command over my cou∣sin, because she puts herself on a le∣vel with her by mean teazing and raillery;—a passionate temper was never mended by irritation.—By the way, I don't much like this scheme of playing with Charles; Juliet and he always quarrel, and I am afraid he will overthrow all her good resolutions.

<P>This is a pretty room, mama.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very much so, I see it again with great pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is some time, I think, since you were here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs, Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, near two years. Mrs. Melville has been gone so long on business of her late husband's to an estate he had in Jamaica.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How glad you will be to see her again! What a delight∣ful day we shall spend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will indeed give me great pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her daughter!—Oh, mama, what joy to her to see her mother again after an absence of two years!—I should envy her, if I had not passed those two years with the best of mothers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has indeed
<PB N="5" REF="034381_0028_0FFF0B49E41E0860"/>
probably lost much by so long an absence from her who is so well a∣ble to instruct her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly!—Ah, whose instructions can teach the heart so soon as those of a mother, whose reproofs proceed from affec∣tion, whose praises are the greatest glory of a child!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true,—a child must be obstinate indeed, who refuses to listen to the instructions of a fond mother.—Mrs. Melville is entitled to her daughter's best affections, not only by the good∣ness of her heart and understanding, but by the sacrifices she has made for her sake.—When Mr. Melville died, he left his large estate in Jamaica to his little girl: on in∣quiry, her mother found that the estate had been, and still was, ill managed by the steward; in short,
<PB N="6" REF="034381_0029_0FFF0B4B6A6D9280"/>
that nothing but the presence of some person interested in its im∣provement could render it half so valuable as it had been supposed.—She determined, therefore, to over∣come her dread of the sea, which all her life had been extreme; to leave her friends, her sister, even her child, in England, and under∣take the voyage herself.—This she has done; has restored the estate to the most flourishing condition, and is now returned to enjoy the re∣ward of her labours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a charming cha∣racter!—<HI>(A short pause.)</HI> I like this room very much, 'tis so pleasant and quiet—(<HI>She rises and walks a∣bout</HI>)—Mama, may I look at this book?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is lying open to every-one's in∣spection, it cannot be improper, but
<PB N="7" REF="034381_0029_0FFF0B4B6A6D9280"/>
it is impertinent and ill-bred to look even into <HI>printed</HI> books, which are placed out of immediate view.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>"The Beauties of Sterne!"—It has Miss Melville's name in it.—I do not know this book, Mama.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear, tho' it has great merit in point of writing and sentiment, it is not ex∣actly the book I should chuse for you at present. In my opinion it recommends too much the enervat∣ing mind of Sensibility, to which I so greatly object.—But here come Mrs. Melville and Isabella.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. Melville and Isabella.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, how much I rejoice to see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>The pleasure is mutual, believe me!—It is so long since we met, I began to fear we should meet no more!—This is, I
<PB N="8" REF="034381_0030_0FFF0B4E89BA3C00"/>
believe, Miss Melville, but so grown I should hardly have known her!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not more than Miss Rivers.—I must have the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> young people acquainted.</P>
<STAGE>(Mrs. Melville introduces Cecilia and Isabella to each other, they curtsy, and seem to talk apart.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope they will be so, nothing can give me more pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I forget to beg your pardon for keeping you waiting, I had strolled beyond the garden into the field, and Mar∣tha could not find me.—She has shown you into a litter'd room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>No apology is necessary, I have long known and loved this room.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is my daugh∣ter's now, I gave it up to her the day after my return, and she has already brought hither her books and work—so that she has the confusion to answer for—</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>smiling.</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a becoming confusion, I like to see books and work about in a young person's a∣partment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine would have been in better order, mama, if you had not called me away suddenly.—Besides I hardly know where I am, or what I do at present.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say, my dear, you have hardly yet recover∣ed, if I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o express myself, the happiness of seeing your mother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, Ma'am!—The extreme joy almost over∣come me. It may well be called <HI>recovery,</HI> for such delight is really

<STAGE>(<HI>Mrs. Rivers looks at her wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h some surprise.</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine was, and still is, exquisite!—To return once more to my friends, to my sister, to my daughter, is happiness so great as wholly to repay me all I have suffered in my absence from them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, every sacrifice we make of pleasure to duty will, sooner or later, be re∣paid; even the conviction of hav∣ing done so carries with it a com∣fort to the heart superior to all the advantages to be derived from a deviation from virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say true. It was with extreme regret that I prepared to quit England, and to leave my daughter; but the assurance that my departure was necessary to her future welfare, the
<PB N="11" REF="034381_0031_0FFF0B516EB3AC58"/>
dread of endangering her health, then extremely delicate, by take∣ing her with me, and the convic∣tion that I left her in proper care, conspired to determine me, and I am now repaid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, mama, I should have been <HI>so</HI> afraid of the sea and storms!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, you are a silly child, to form such a terrible idea of dangers, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> princi∣pally imaginary.—But, my dear Mrs. Rivers, will you go with me to my greenhouse?—I have some curious West-India plants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart.—Children, will you stay here, or go with us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mother I am sure will be happy in my forming an intimacy with you, she has so high an opinion of Mrs. Melville!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will give me infi∣nite pleasure.—Suffer me to say I already feel I shall love you ex∣tremely, I am already attached to you.—Dear Cecilia, may I believe the impression is mutual!</P>

<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no doubt, on a farther acquaintance, my gratitude for your kindness will ripen into real regard.</P>

<P>You alarm and dis∣tress me.—What at your age can have happened to make you so un∣easy?</P>

<P>Alas, my dear Cecilia, amidst all my joy for the return of my mother, I endure severe regret, <HI>bitter anguish</HI> I might call it.</P>

<P>I do indeed, but sure∣ly
<PB N="14" REF="034381_0033_0FFF0B5491437AB8"/>

<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my <HI>sweet friend.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inflated and strong language Isabella uses, is one symptom of False Sensibility.—To apply violent terms on common occasions is equally absurd and unnatural</NOTE>—From your tenderness I expect the only consolation of which my situation is capable.—How will your kind and gentle nature pity me when you hear the loss I have sustained!</P>

<P>What can it be, when your mother is still with you?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the seat of my aunt, where I have been during my mother's absence, I contracted a <HI>strong</HI> and <HI>ardent</HI> attachment to a young lady about your age.—I even think you resemble her,—
<PB N="15" REF="034381_0033_0FFF0B5491437AB8"/>
you have the same softness of com∣plexion, the same sweet smile!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(embracing her.)</STAGE>
<P>Ah, my dear Isabella, I will spare you the relation.—I guess too easily what you have suffered!—It is true I have never formed any friendship out of my own family, but I can conceive what its feelings must be.—And have you really lost, for e∣ver, a tie so tender?</P>

<P>Not, I hope, <HI>for ever.</HI></P>

<P>How!—I have mis∣understood you.—I believe you meant to have said she was dead.</P>

<P>Oh no!—I should hardly be able to survive so great a misfortune.—Is it not enough to be separated from her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>You fear you shall, perhaps, meet her no more!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.—She is to spend the greatest part of the summer with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="034381_0034_0FFF0B5798EA4008"/>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not understand—what then do you lament?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>What?—Surely her absence at present!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the absence of a few months do you regret so deeply!—I profess you surprise me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella,</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(a little disconcerted.)</STAGE>
<P>But I have been so accustomed to see her every day, she is so charm∣ing—and my misfortune is too great sensibility!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can sensibility become a misfortune and a torment?—I have been taught to consider it as the source of goodness and delight—True, indeed, we may be some∣times severely pained by the im∣possibility of relieving those whom we pity, by the illness of friends, and various other circumstances, but at the same time an active wish

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>But unfortunately I feel so much. I can do very little to relieve the pain of those I love; my presence of mind forsakes me, and I become unable to assist them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pardon me for say∣ing that it is a sort of weakness a∣gainst which we ought to struggle, our feeling becomes useless, worse than useless; it <HI>disables</HI> us if it does does not <HI>prompt</HI> us to action. We might as well not feel for the unhappy, as not seek to relieve them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sympathise with them, but my spirits are so weak I can do little more.</P>

<P>I once hardly could have believed I should wish a child of mine to want Sensibility; but I see in Isabella how much it tends to increase the unavoidable distresses of human life, even to <HI>create</HI> them where they are not; so that I really think had I ano∣ther child to educate, I should la∣bour as much as possible to suppress this pleasing, but unhappy quality.</P>

<L>And Heav'n's own impress stamp on Nature's gold;</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you fully, my dear friend, as to the <HI>graces</HI> and <HI>charms</HI> of Sensibility; but allow me to differ from you a moment. Was not <HI>Cato</HI> a great character, yet had he sensibility, who did not shed a tear over the bo∣dy of his son, just slain in battle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly yes.—First we ought to consider the education which was given to the Romans.—We ought to re∣collect that their country was the chief object of their love, and that they were taught to despise all considerations which interfered
<PB N="26" REF="034381_0039_0FFF0B63F8C69B60"/>
with their duty to that.—Thus when Cato saw the dead body of his son, he did not weep, because <HI>true</HI> Sensibility exalted his mind to the height of patriotism, which made him willingly yield his son a victim to Rome.—He wished also to encourage the sinking Romans, by making their lives less valuable in their eyes, when he, to whom they looked for example, could so chearfully par with that life which was dearer to him than his own.—What but Sensibility could have awakened this high sense of duty, and heroic resolution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is ex∣actly what I complain of, Sensibili∣ty, at least the sensibility I am used to see, <HI>enervates</HI> and <HI>weakens</HI> the mind; it destroys this heroic resolution, this preference of duty to indulgence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="034381_0039_0FFF0B63F8C69B60"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>"The Sensibility you are used to see," these words explain to me your meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think then there are two kinds of Sensi∣bility?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly.—Or rather I should say that which is commonly dignified with that charming name, is unworthy of it; and if you will allow me to say so, by what I have seen of Miss Melville's, that is the Sensi∣bility she possesses, though perhaps mixed and blended with the true mind. Let us refer again to the delightful Authoress I have al∣ready quoted, whose every line contains meaning and reason.
<Q><L>Tis not to mourn because a Sparrow dies,</L>
<L>To rave in artificial extasi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s!</L></Q>
I would have Sensibility a <HI>spring</HI> of
<PB N="28" REF="034381_0040_0FFF0B6580810740"/>
<HI>Action.</HI> I would have it directed to a generous, firm line of Conduct. In short, it should be <HI>Principle re∣fined and pointed.</HI> I would have young people taught to treat every creature with mercy and kindness, but I would not have them waste their tenderness and affection on a set of Animals. I would have them anxious to relieve every thing in distress, but I would not have them
<Q><L>Boast quick rapture trembling in their eye,</L>
<L>If from the Spider's web they save a Fly.</L></Q>
Far would I be from wishing them to have the word <HI>Sensibility</HI> contin∣ually in their mouths, tho' I would never for an instant have it quit their hearts. It ought to <HI>animate,</HI> not <HI>deject</HI> them; to <HI>strengthen,</HI> not <HI>enervate</HI> their minds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are per∣fectly
<PB N="29" REF="034381_0040_0FFF0B6580810740"/>
right, my dear friend but how shall we teach young people to draw the line?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>By not suffering them to pass it, without reprehen∣sion; by not praising them for <HI>feeling,</HI> by not allowing them to exaggerate their <HI>language,</HI> which leads to that hateful exaggeration of Sentiment I so much dislike.—Accustomed to express themselves strongly, to say they <HI>"love,"</HI> they <HI>"detest"</HI>—they are in <HI>"anguish,"</HI> in <HI>"extasy,"</HI> they strive to make their feelings correspond with their words: if they succeed, their im∣aginations become inflamed and de∣lusive; if they do not, they are perpetually affected and unnatural.—Let them ask themselves, whe∣ther they really <HI>feel</HI> what they <HI>ex∣press,</HI> when they say they <HI>love</HI> or <HI>hate</HI> any-thing; let them first con∣sider
<PB N="30" REF="034381_0041_0FFF0B681ABDF668"/>
whether it is worth <HI>loving</HI> or <HI>hating,</HI> and then whether they really <HI>do</HI> love or hate it: they will then not be so easily deceived <HI>them∣selves,</HI> which, I believe, generally is the case before they seek to de∣ceive <HI>others.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Melville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure you are right, and I shall earnestly press this knowledge of <HI>herself</HI> on Isa∣bella.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs Rivers.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have always done so with Cecilia; and I wish young people would consider how much more amiable, simple unaf∣fected manners are, than that pom∣pous prentence of feeling and ten∣derness of which some are so fond.</P>

<P>Pardon me.—There are cases in which we must <HI>feel</HI> unhap∣py, whether we struggle against it or not: but do you not think much of our unhappiness depends on our indulging melancholy, or striving against it?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="034381_0044_0FFF0B6F8D37D9A0"/>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be very much grieved!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of course—but should you attend to them yourself, or how should you act?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should wish to at∣tend them, but I fear I should be too unhappy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you were yourself ill, how should you expect your mother to act?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh I know very well she would attend me constantly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, do you not be∣lieve she would feel a great deal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, I am sure of it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should you not be very much distress'd, if, instead of at∣tending you, she disturbed you by continual sighs and tears, and rendered herself so incapable of assisting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be obliged to leave you to the care of servants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="37" REF="034381_0044_0FFF0B6F8D37D9A0"/>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>The inference is so obvious, I will leave you to draw it for your self.—Only let me hint, if every-body felt as you say <HI>you</HI> do, and acted in consequence, what would become of those who are sick, or in danger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are certainly right—but how am I to conquer this excessive feeling?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simply by not indulging it—Perhaps your mind will some∣times turn itself from a suffering object; but do not heed it.—<HI>Force it to act.</HI>—Do not say "I <HI>cannot</HI>"—but <HI>try.</HI>—<HI>Think</HI> you can, and you will be able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am even sure of it.—I will give you an instance; I am myself extremely afraid of <HI>Fire!</HI> and used to tell my mama I believed
<PB N="38" REF="034381_0045_0FFF0B720D98C620"/>
if my bed were on fire, I should be burnt for want of resolution to move. She took a great deal of pains to reason me out of this be∣lief, which she foresaw might be so dangerous.—Last summer, when we were at my aunt's, I was one evening in my own room, which joins the nursery, where her little girl was sleeping, the nursery maid was just gone down stairs, I smelt fire, and running into the nursery, saw that the cat had jumped on a table where the maid had placed a candle, and had beat the candle into the cradle where the baby was—the quilt was in a blaze!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh mercy!—what did you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My first impulse was to run for help, but struck with the idea that the infant would be burnt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stifled before help could arrive,
<PB N="39" REF="034381_0045_0FFF0B720D98C620"/>
I said to myself "Oh mama, let me now remember your lessons!"—I flew to the cradle, snatched up a small carpet, and threw into the cradle; it extinguished the flame: I then seized the child, and ran with her down stairs.—You may suppose that my mother and aunt thought me distracted; but when I explained to them what had happened, I thought my aunt would never cease thanking and praising me.—She told me I had saved her from despair and distrac∣tion; that her child should be taught to love me as a second mo∣ther.—I short I cannot repeat to you half she said, or describe the painful delight I felt in her grati∣tude and joy.</P>
</SP>

<P>I hope so!—Never let me again incur a pang so severe as that I felt when my mother spoke of the sweetness of being assisted by her child, when I had
<PB N="49" REF="034381_0050_0FFF0B7E73388898"/>
not been of the least service to her.—And again, when she said "You and Cecilia will assist me"—as if I were not there! as if, alas, but too justly, I were a useless, help∣less being!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cecilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us drop these un∣pleasant ideas, and hope that the consequence will be a fixed resolu∣tion on your part to encourage for∣titude and activity, and to repress enervating and excessive feeling.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shall indeed; and still, dear Cecilia, counsel and ad∣vise me. Be as sincere as I have hitherto found you; be my moni∣tor, my adviser, and my <HI>advocate.</HI>—Dear girl, (embracing her) how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I ever enough thank you for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se generous tears you shed, when pleading for me to my mother!—My heart, at least, has for once e∣lected a real friend!</P>

<P>I hope so, but the same facility with which I was exalted to that character, might expose you to much deceit and treachery.—You see I use the privilege you give me.</P>

<P>Do so always, and assist me if you can, to root up my idle prejudices altogether, and to renounce, for ever, the exaggerated expressions and unnatural sentiments of that which you have convinced me is false SENSIBILITY.</P>

<STAGE>Enter Mrs. Cecil, Sophia, and Eudocia.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I FEEL so chearful this fine morning, that I hope I shall get through my employments comfortably before we go for our ride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the sun is so enlivening, we shall enjoy our air∣ing of all things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>To do that, you must all of you perform your tasks well.—As to Miss Mildmay, I need not remind her, she is always ready.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="4" REF="034381_0053_0FFF0A51C5A9D828"/>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are always too good to me, my dear governess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not better than you deserve, Sophia, we are all ready to allow that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, the praise of candour and affection be∣longs to you equally.—But we lose time.—Where is Miss Laura?—Idling, I dare say. I never shall succeed in my endeavours to teach that child the value of those minutes she wastes so abominably!—Nothing but a concurrence of circumstances will make her aware of the necessity there is, if we would go through our duties properly, of being punctual. 'Tis past nine, she must know it, and yet she is not here.—Do, Miss Eudocia, ring the bell. <HI>(Eudocia rings the bell, they draw a small table, and sit down to work.)</HI></P>

<P>Sally, pray tell Miss Laura 'tis past nine; I want her here.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, ma'am.</P>
<STAGE>(She goes out.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think Sal∣ly a very good girl ma'am?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do indeed. Your mama has had her in her ser∣vice six years, all that time she has behaved unexceptionably. She was very young when she came hither, and had before been tole∣rably educated; therefore I do not object to your talking to her some∣times, though I strictly forbid your doing so to the other servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are perfectly con∣vinced of the propriety of that. Indeed I cannot conceive how any one can wish it, their language is
<PB N="6" REF="034381_0054_0FFF0B80407E7ED0"/>
so unpleasant; and can one expect either pleasure or improvement from those who have had no edu∣cation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those must have a very bad taste who do.</P>
<STAGE>Laura runs in.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear ma'am, is it nine o'clock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a full quarter after; what have you been doing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why ma'am, I asked after breakfast what it was o'clock, and they said it wanted a quarter of nine, so I thought I would set one of my drawers in order, but I did not begin directly, and I fancy that made me so late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, most likely—your drawers generally require more than a quarter of an hour to set them to rights, and even of that quarter it seems you trifled a∣way
<PB N="7" REF="034381_0054_0FFF0B80407E7ED0"/>
part. If you would but con∣sider whether it is possible to do what you undertake in the time you can spare to it, you would not be so often behind your time.—And how have you left your cloaths now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh ma'am, when Sally called me, I <HI>push'd</HI> them all into the drawer as well as I could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(laughing.) Push'd</HI> them—yes, your things are generally pretty well <HI>push'd,</HI> as you call it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have nothing to do with that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, leave off talking, and get to work—but remember I <HI>will</HI> have your drawer set to rights before you go out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh I shall have plen∣ty of time to do that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye!—that is exact∣ly
<PB N="8" REF="034381_0055_0FFF0B849A722FF8"/>
your way!—You always have plenty of time in <HI>idea,</HI> and none in <HI>reality;</HI> of course you are always <HI>unpunctual.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I am, it is not a <HI>great</HI> fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fye Laura!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not a great fault?—There I differ from you.—It leads to very unpleasant conse∣quences at least—often to very bad ones. In the first place, you trifle away a great deal of time: for in∣stance, your sisters have been at work some minutes; of course their tasks will be done sooner, and they will have the more time for other employments.—It is a chance if you are ready to go out with your mama: you have all your work to do; to read French, and to put your drawers in order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="034381_0055_0FFF0B849A722FF8"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your accent and manner are a little impertinent, but I will pass that over, as I wish if possible, to convince you by reasoning.—Suppose then, when you are older, you should appoint a friend to meet you at any place, and because you forget, or over stay your time, she is disappointed and has her trouble for nothing—That will be <HI>her</HI> loss, I think!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but it would not be of much consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very slow to be convinced!—Suppose her business is of consequence, and can∣not be delayed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh but I should know that, and should be sure to be there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! if you can all at once break thro' a set∣tled habit, you have greater com∣mand
<PB N="10" REF="034381_0056_0FFF0B861F989B98"/>
of yourself than I give you credit for.—You will see, and we shall learn, if you do not regret the many moments you have lost in idle trifling.—When do you mean to begin work?</P>
<STAGE>(Laura takes several pieces of work out of her bag.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you take out so much at once? you cannot do it all!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which should I do ma'am?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is what you left on Saturday, on promise to do it to-day; and this is your task for this morning, which I <HI>will</HI> have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there is so much!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so much as I have given your sisters!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they are older!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and somewhat
<PB N="11" REF="034381_0056_0FFF0B861F989B98"/>
more industrious: there is not too much for you; so no more dispu∣ting, but begin.</P>
<STAGE>(Laura sits down by Sophia. Af∣ter a short pause, she yawns; then leans on Sophia's chair, and whispers to her, Sophia makes no answer.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(in a low voice.)</HI> Now <HI>pray</HI> do, Sophia!—You cannot think how much I shall be obliged to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush, don't speak so loud!</P>

<P>I do not chuse to whis∣per!</P>

<P>Pray what are you doing, Miss Laura? Attend to your work, I beg of you; you are like all idle people, fond of distur∣bing others.</P>
<STAGE><PB N="12" REF="034381_0057_0FFF0B87A3B10238"/>
<HI>(A short pause, during which they work. When Mrs. Cecil is not observing her, Laura wraps her work round her thread pa∣pers like a doll, and jogs Eudo∣cia.)</HI></STAGE>

<P>Eudocia, look, look, I say, is not it droll?</P>

<P>Asking me, ma'am, to tell her something I have refused to let her know twenty times al∣ready.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vastly well, ma'am except a little—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Laura, I sup∣pose—you are conscious, I see!—I too have a complaint to make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear mama!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have indeed, but sit down to your works.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should I sit, mama while you are speaking to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear, I shall excuse as much of your work as you would have done in the time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>As much as she <HI>might</HI> have done, my dear Mrs. Cecil; what she <HI>would</HI> have done is, I fancy, rather doubtful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(sits down; Laura stands before her.)</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>You look a little alarm'd, Lau∣ra, but I am not very angry with
<PB N="16" REF="034381_0059_0FFF0B8C3647A140"/>
you, since I believe your fault pro∣ceeded as usual from want of thought.—Yesterday, at church my dear, you behaved very ill.—In the first place, while we stood up, I saw your eyes wandering all over the church: in the next place, while we were sitting, you whis∣per'd to Eudocia, jogged her el∣bow, and tried to make her laugh.—Now, my dear, I beg you to consider how very improper all this is.—Do you know for what pur∣pose we go to church?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, mama, surely, to pray to God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, can you think such behaviour proper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it was not during the prayers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, but part was during the psalms, which are intended as immediate addresses to
<PB N="17" REF="034381_0059_0FFF0B8C3647A140"/>
our Creator, of both praise and prayer; therefore we <HI>stand</HI> to show our reverence and attention.—When we were sitting it was to hear the lessons read; that is, selected parts of the holy scripture, the immediate word of God, and the the rule by which we are to direct our life.—Even if the service had not been begun, or had been ended, to talk and laugh would have been highly improper.—It unfits the mind for serious duties, and implies a lightness and thoughtlessness, which ought not to be indulged or allowed in a place sacred to our maker.—Our Saviour showed his disapprobation of any thing which might disturb the tranquillity and decency of the holy place, by driv∣ing from the Temple (the place of worship) at Jerusalem those whom human laws allowed to transact
<PB N="18" REF="034381_0060_0FFF0B8E93703628"/>
business there, saying, "It is writ∣ten, my house shall be called the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves."—I am sure if you were in the President's presence, you would not be so ill-bred as to laugh and whisper, when he was speaking to you, or allowing a∣nother to do so; how much less then, when God speaks to you by his scriptures, ought you to behave irreverently?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am fully convinced, mama, I am much obliged to you for taking the trouble of instruct∣ing me▪ and, I assure you, I will never behave so aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you also, mama, for I never saw this matter so clearly before.—I knew it was wrong to talk at church, but some∣times I have forgotten it; now I think nothing will ever tempt me to do so again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="034381_0060_0FFF0B8E93703628"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am always happy, my children, to be of service to you, and while I see you will∣ing to be convinced and to amend, I am over paid for any trouble I can be at in instructing yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.—Laura, return to your work.—At one o'clock, you will all be ready to go out; I shall not wait a min∣ute for any-body, unless Mrs. Ce∣cil can give me a good reason for the delay. Sophia, your brother will take you in his phae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on; our cold provisions are all packed up.—I hope to hear a good account of you all: remember, that if you would enjoy the ride, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of the gardens we are to visit, you must behave well.—Good-bye.—Mrs. Cecil, a good morning to you.—I hope you will like our ride.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, ma'am, I

<P>Now, Mrs. Cecil, how much will you allow me, to leave of my work?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is Laura's first concern?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it would be yours, if you had as much to do as I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>had</HI> as much at first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>But mama has not been talking to you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, because I behav∣ed better yesterday than you did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eudocia, when my mother is satisfied with the atone∣ment for a fault, it does not be∣come us to mention it reproachful∣ly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank ye, Sophia, you seldom take my part, and Eudocia
<PB N="21" REF="034381_0061_0FFF0B90CFAD59F8"/>
deserves a <HI>good lecture</HI> this time—however!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think I do not <HI>often</HI> deserve one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>However that may be, you certainly <HI>de</HI> now.—Have done disputing, Eudocia, that is your principal fault; you have been wrong all the way now you had, as your sister observed, no right, nor was it kind, to resume a subject your mama had done with; and to answer so sharply and so of∣ten, shews an inclination to quar∣rel, very unpleasant and improper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(after a short pause.)</HI> It is very true, I have been wrong. Laura, I beg your pardon.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, I am pleased with Eudocia!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, nothing affects me like hearing any one say in that honest way, "I was wrong, I beg your pardon."—I never can help crying, and I feel so sorry and so humble, and so pleased with them—But in spite of all that, I never can prevail on myself to ask par∣don; I feel so ashamed, and so afraid of being laughed at!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is <HI>false</HI> shame.—No shame is just, but the shame of a bad or improper action; and as to being laughed at, the person who <HI>can</HI> laugh at another for doing as she ought, must be un∣able to taste the sweetness of vir∣tue, and the <HI>exaltation</HI> of <HI>humility.</HI>—But go on with your work, Laura: I shall allow you to leave off, when you have done so much,

<P>Yes, ma'am.—<HI>(She sits down by Mrs. Cecil; takes a small book, and reads.)</HI> "Come ye who love to see what is beautiful—come who wish to enjoy what is sublime—come and I will di∣rect your eyes to the bright Moon, which rides triumphantly on the bosom of heaven.

with my misfortunes, and he spoke to me with a confidence which the Gods inspired, to save me from imminent danger.—Telemachus, said he to me, I neither do nor can doubt that which you tell me. The softness and virtue painted on your countenance will not suffer me to supect you; I even feel that the Gods whom I have always served love you, and decree that I shall regard you as my son. I will give you salutary con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els, and in return I only demand that you shall be secret.—Fear not, said I to him, that I shall find any difficul∣ty in concealing those things which you confide to me. Though young, I am old in the habit of never re∣vealing my own secrets, and still less the secrets of others. How have you been able, said he, in such extreme youth, to accustom your∣self

to secrecy: I shall be delight∣ed to know by what means you have acquired that quality, which is the foundation of the wisest con∣duct, and without which all tal∣ents are useless? When Ulysses, I replied, departed for the siege of Troy, he took me on his knees, holding me in his arms, (as I have been told) and after he had kissed me tenderly, he used these words, tho' I could not understand them. Oh! my son, may the Gods never suffer me to see thee again; rather let the fatal scissars cut the thread of thy days ere it be half formed, as the reaper cuts down with his sickle a tender flower as it be∣gins to open; may my enemies dash thee in pieces before the eyes of thy mother and myself, if thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doomed one day to be corrupt∣ed and to abandon virtue!—Oh'

my friends, continued he, I leave to you a son so dear: take care of his infancy. If you love me, banish from him pernicious flatter∣ry; teach him how to conquer his passions, that he may be like a tender plant which men often bend in order to make it grow upright: above all, forget nothing which may render him just; benevolent, sincere, and faithful in keeping a secret: whoever is capable of ly∣ing, does not deserve to live; and whoever knows not how to be si∣lent, is unworthy to govern.

<P>Why, I'll tell you. About a month ago, mama gave Sophia two guineas, and told her to buy whatever she liked best with it. She gave one to Eudocia and one to me. Eudocia bought a small writing desk; and I bought a squirrel's cage, and some flower seeds for my garden: but Sophia said she would wait awhile and consider before she bought. Well, yesterday it came into my head that she had not bought any thing; and I asked her what she should purchase with her two guineas.—
<PB N="45" REF="034381_0073_0FFF0F3880F19B90"/>

<P>Alas aday, my young

lady, I am grievous poor; I am a widow, with three children, the eldest of 'em is out at service, but the two little ones are too young to go out: my old mother lives with us; she is helpless, and you may think, miss, I find it hard to keep so many with the work of my own hands.—In the summer, I work in the fields: in the win∣ter, I spin; and my children help me as well as they can. For two years, that my husband has been dead, we have done pretty well, 'till this last winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>What happened then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ruth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, miss! in the au∣tumn, I was so unhappy as to get an ague, which hindered my working a great deal; my children could do but little; they began to get dirty and ragged; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut me to the heart to see them so,
<PB N="51" REF="034381_0076_0FFF0F40F85E34D0"/>
and not be able to help them!—To complete my misfortune, a dog got into my little garden, and killed my two hens, whose eggs used to furnish us with a sure penny. Things went from bad to worse; I was fain to run in debt to my landlord, and tho' now the summer is coming on, and I am better, I hope I should be able to pay him; the cruel man de∣clares he will seize for rent to-mor∣row morning.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>

<P>Ah, miss, you are

very good!—but don't think I came here to beg my lady to pay for me; no, indeed, miss I only thought if she would speak to my landlord, he would may-be wait a little; and indeed I hope I shall pay him every farthing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ruth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you a thousand times, good young lady; we shall all pray for, and bless you. I have often seen your two sisters walking with Madam Cecil, and I have thought when Miss Mild∣may looked so kindly on my poor little girls, while they opened the gate for her, and said with her sweet voice, "Poor children, there's a penny for you."—I have
<PB N="54" REF="034381_0078_0FFF0F444A485AD0"/>
thought if she did but know how wretched we were, she would speak to my lady for us; but I had not the heart to tell her, 'till now; things getting so bad, I thought I would try at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did very right.—Call again at six o'clock; I will see you, and before that I will speak to mama, you may depend on it.—In the mean time, I will give you this half crown; I have no more.</P>

<P>So I hear—but why I wonder did she never come hither before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, miss! 'tis very hard to beg; people who have been u∣sed to keep themselves by their own industry, are ashamed and afraid to ask relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ashamed, perhaps; but why <HI>afraid?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, miss, so many gentlefolks are cross and hard∣hearted; and one says—"Where did you learn all that history," and another says, "Ah, a sad sto∣ry, if it is true!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is abominable if we don't chuse to give, we need not <HI>insult</HI> the poor creature who begs from us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="034381_0079_0FFF0F45D56DB3D8"/>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, miss, but too many don't think of that; they forget that a beggar has any feel∣ing. I once saw a poor man col∣our like scarlet, and his eyes spar∣kle with anger, at a gentleman, who said he was an impostor; but, poor wretch, he recollected him∣self, put his hand on his bosom, sighed and passed on.—I gave him a trifle; he bowed, and I saw the tears in his eyes; he did not speak.—Poor creature, truly he was cut to the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a good girl, Sally—but tell me what you know of this poor woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, miss, she lives in a little cottage just at the end of the village, and keeps it very neat when she is well; she has two pretty children, and her mother (a good old woman) lives with her▪
<PB N="58" REF="034381_0080_0FFF0F4829A35128"/>
the old woman is lame, but has all her senses, and when dame Saun∣ders was so ill, the poor old woman used to cry, and the little girls, thinking to comfort her, said, "Don't cry grandmother, I will feed you, and put on your clean cap for you."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor little dears!—how did you know this, Sally?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh I heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem one day, miss; when I was walking by the house, I saw the poor wo∣man standing at the door; she look'd sickly, so I asked her a few questions, and found the ague was off that day, and she had crept to the door for a little air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when was this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>About a month ago, miss.</P>

<P>And why did you not t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll mama?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, miss, and my
<PB N="59" REF="034381_0080_0FFF0F4829A35128"/>
mistress ordered the cook to send her some broth twice or three times, and Miss Sophia sent her a shilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, miss, because Miss Sophia never tells the good she does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is right, but I wonder I don't hear of it.—Indeed I never see any poor people; they don't come here, I fancy?</P>

<P>No, miss, your gover∣ness and sisters find them out when they walk of a morning before breakfast.</P>

<P>I believe so too.—We will ask her presently, if Laura has been questioning her.—But why did you so much object to Laura's knowing it, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="034381_0083_0FFF0F51758C9E40"/>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because mama, Laura can no more keep a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, than she can let any one else keep it in peace, and I know she would have told every-body she had met with; which, for many reasons, I wish'd to avoid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, that those who are extremely cu∣rious, are generally unable to keep a secret, because it gratifies their self-importance, to shew that <HI>they</HI> know more than <HI>others,</HI> and be∣cause they hope to obtain new se∣crets, in return for those they tell: not considering, that a wise person will never place confidence in one who has abused the same trust from another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing, I think, on which young people ought to be more scrupulous than on the subject of Confidence.—Let
<PB N="66" REF="034381_0084_0FFF0F530199CA40"/>
them not be over-fond of seeking a trust, which generally brings with it anxiety and care; but if by any accident, or any necessity, they find themselves in possession of a secret, they ought, with ex∣treme delicacy and caution, to preserve a trust so sacred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most surely.—And the limits of Confidence are very strict.—It is not <HI>only</HI> what our friends say, prefaced by "I <HI>beg you will not tell this,"</HI> which we ought to consider as <HI>confided</HI> to us. Every thing which we can suppose they would not <HI>wish</HI> re∣vealed, we ought to consider as told in confidence. Having once confi∣ded in a person, we do not say eve∣ry minute, <HI>"don't mention that."</HI>—We suppose their own prudence will teach them what ought to be kept secret; and <HI>every thing</HI> is told
<PB N="67" REF="034381_0084_0FFF0F530199CA40"/>
in confidence which passes between friends, either relating to their situations, sentiments, or opinions; often, indeed, when referring to these circumstances in others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mama, I have heard people say, that we ought not to tell to one friend what another has told us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not. The person who confides in <HI>you</HI> may not have an equally good opinion of your friend, or circumstances may render it very improper to entrust <HI>her. You</HI> may not be able to judge of these circumstances; therefore you ought to be as reser∣ved to her as to the rest of the world: besides, <HI>she</HI> also might have a <HI>friend,</HI> to whom she might not scruple to tell the secret; that friend another, and so on without any bound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="68" REF="034381_0085_0FFF0F55F08DF268"/>
<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see that very clear∣ly.—But suppose I should, know the person who entrusts me is also very intimate with my friend, and loves her, might I not then talk about the affair with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not with∣out leave from the person who en∣trusts you; if she chuses to tell this third person, she <HI>can;</HI> if not, you may be sure she has some reason against it. I lately read a story exactly in point.—When Gen. Monk projected the Restoration of Charles the IId. he maintained the strictest reserve on the subject, e∣ven to his friends.—He sent, how∣ever, for his brother, Dr. Monk, intending to confide his plan to him, and even giving him some hints respecting it.—When Dr. Monk arrived, while waiting for admis∣sion to the General, he entered in∣to
<PB N="69" REF="034381_0085_0FFF0F55F08DF268"/>
conversation with the General's Chaplain, in whom he knew he confided and talked with him on the plan.—When he was admitted to his brother, the General asked him if he had mentioned the subject to any one?—"To nobody," said the Doctor, "but to your Chap∣lain, whom I know you trust."—The General immediately changed countenance, dropped the discourse and soon after sent his brother a∣way; not chusing to trust a man who had talked on a subject of so much consequence to another, even tho' he would himself have trusted him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s History of England.</NOTE>. A proof of his wisdom; for surely Dr. Monk had evident∣ly shewed a want of delicacy in his se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ments, which rendered
<PB N="70" REF="034381_0086_0FFF0F5779555670"/>
him u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it to have the care of a plan so important!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire the General's conduct extremely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was undoubt∣edly right. The faculty of keep∣ing a secret is highly necessary, yet rarely possessed. I made Laura remark that admirable pas∣sage in Telemachus to-day, because I remember the effect it had on myself.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is absolutely fact, of a child well known to the Author.</NOTE> Always fond of read∣ing, Telemachus fell early into my hands: I was not above eight years old when that passage struck me; I reflected on it, and it has in∣fluenced my conduct ever since. Such indeed has been the constant advantage I have derived from books.—My mother died <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ung:
<PB N="71" REF="034381_0086_0FFF0F5779555670"/>
and my father, encumbered with the care of a family, left us in great measure to educate ourselves. I was naturally very passionate, very idle, fond of beginning every thing, and ending nothing; but with a constant fondness for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d∣ing, which in the end supplied to me the place of an instructor.—The same author, I have always loved so much, says in another place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Happy those who are amused by Instruction, and take delight in cultiva∣ting their minds by Science.

<P>An admira∣ble example, and well worthy of being followed by those young people whose parents are either dead, or so engaged in business, as not to be able to attend to them: such young people would do well to observe the convictions of their own heart, and reason, and follow them, not refuse to listen to them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eudocia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often heard people say, it is of no use to <HI>read</HI> without <HI>reflection;</HI> but I never quite understood what was meant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reflection, before. However, we are very happy in having a mother and governess so well able to instruct us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, you have great advantages; but, that does not render reflection less necessary to you: without it, our
<PB N="74" REF="034381_0088_0FFF0F5C1976D450"/>
precepts will be soon forgotten; and when you come to act for yourself, you will look round for those rules by which indeed you have been guided, but which you have neglected to implant in your heart; and missing them, you will no more know how to act in the world, than a man to find his way thro' a wood, which he had often seen at a distance, but whose particular situation he had neglect∣ed to mark.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ma'am, there is a poor woman below, who came while you were out: she saw Miss Lau∣ra,

<P>She is down stairs, ma'am. It is Dame Saunders.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cecil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shameful for Laura to have neglected an appoint∣ment; on which, probably, the peace and happiness of this poor woman depended!—And to have been surpassed by her servant in faithfulness and secresy!—All her faults proceed from carless∣ness, inattention, and want of punctuality.—Great vices, as well as great virtues, are rare; but it is those errors, which seem at first trifling, but which grow upon us by degrees, of which we ought principally to beware.</P>

<P>Oh, Mrs. Cecil, mama has rendered this poor woman <HI>so</HI> happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—She has been in the greatest distress about her rent: mama has given her money to pay it, and money to buy food and cloaths.

<P>My dear, I should be happy to do so; but I wish very much you would be kind enough to stay in this room.

<P>Very well—I will call with you, then, to-morrow.</P>

<P>If you please; you o∣blige me extremely by this compli∣ance.—Only think, Laura had promised Ruth Saunders to repre∣sent her situation to mama, and to give her the answer at six o'clock.
<PB N="79" REF="034381_0090_0FFF0F60A28A77E0"/>
She forgot all that!—but she gave her all the money she had; and Ruth said, behaved so kindly to her, as to make her quite happy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, Eudocia!—Where are mama and Mrs. Cecil; and Sophia, I don't see her either!—We have had a charming ride! My brother was very good to take me out, and he has been telling

<P>You must know then, that, during the winter, I observed two pretty little girls, in the vil∣lage, almost without cloaths: I pitied them very much, and wished I could relieve them. I began by saving all I could out of my allow∣ance,

and had already some shil∣lings in advance, when mama gave me the two guineas: with her leave, I laid it out entirely in cloaths for the two little girls, and their mother, of whose distress I heard sad accounts.—Mrs. Cecil, Sally and I, have been hard at work in making these cloaths, whenever we could find time, and all is now finished.</P>

<P>What would you say?—Why this extreme a∣gitation?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh mama, while you were gone, a poor woman came hither: she wanted relief from you; I saw her, I promised to in∣tercede for her, and give her the answer at six o'clock.—Her land∣lord has threaten'd to take all her goods for rent to-morrow morn∣ing. She hopes I shall prevail on you to plead for her to him. Dear∣est mama, will you grant me this

favour? Indeed she deserves your goodness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you know that?</P>

<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, mama, she told me all her story: she has been sick; she has two children, and an old mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Laura, it is easy to say all that; nay, it may be true, and yet she may be idle and undeserving. You know I never exert myself but in favour of worthy objects. I have now no time to inquire, 'tis past seven, and very near dark; can I learn the truth of this story to-night?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, mama, I have been sadly to blame indeed, but I assure you this shall be the last time.

<PB N="92" REF="034381_0097_0FFF0F71B50B5880"/>
all the sad consequences I have de∣scribed to you would be realized, and even all I can do will hardly efface from the mind of this poor woman the anguish she suffered when told you were gone out, and had not mentioned her to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, mama, you will be good enough to assist her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly I will; your breach of promise can be no reason why I should fail in my duty: but if. I had waited till I heard the story from you, it would really have been too late for me to do any thing in it, as I could not have learned all I wanted to know at this time.</P>

<SPEAKER>Laura.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you then heard it before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; Sally, not finding you, came to me. I saw the poor woman; heard her

story, and having had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason before to believe it, I relieved her. So∣phia has given her a box of cloaths, and she is gone home perfectly hap∣py.</P>
</SP>

<P>Mama, do you forgive me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mildmay.</SPEAKER>
<P>I forgive you, hoping you will correct yourself, and that you now see the fault, you thought so trifling, is really of se∣rious consequence: but altho' I am no longer <HI>displeased,</HI> I shall inflict a punishment in addition to that which you have already suffered.

<STAGE>SCENE, a Garden—Parlour.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Mrs. Montfort and Maria, at work.—Matilda and Harriot at a win∣dow; one dressing a doll, the other playing with a bandalore.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>HARRIOT, don't you think my doll looks very pretty in this bon∣net?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I wish you would make me such a one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, to be sure!—No indeed!—Why don't you make yourself one?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I don't know how.—Well, if you won't, Maria will; won't you Maria?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make my doll a bon∣net, like Matilda's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Perhaps—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, only <HI>perhaps</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Miss Har∣riot, it must depend on whether you behave properly, and whether your mama chuses it to be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but I will behave properly, and then mama will chuse it to be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall see that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall make my doll so many things this summer; we shall have so much time in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so much time truly!</P>

<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we shall!—The days will be very long, and we shall get up early.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but then we shall run in the garden, and plant flowers, and that will take up our time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall we plant flowers?—We don't know how, nor when to water them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, James will tell us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I wish Miss Rosetta would come. I suppose she is pretty stupid!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, and so awkward!—I dare say she hangs down her head, and won't speak, like those little girls we saw when we were in Worcester.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda,</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(laughing.)</STAGE>
<P>Oh dear!—How droll they used to be. They used to curtsey, just so, <HI>(mimicking)</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="034381_0102_0FFF0A55D4DE1638"/>
and say, yes, miss; if you please, <HI>miss!—</HI>and they were so <HI>ignorant</HI> too!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, yes!—They did not know how to dance, nor to draw, nor to do fine work.—What stupid children!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you have made me think of them, I shall laugh if Miss Rosetta should be like them.—Harriot, don't make me laugh when she comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't <HI>you</HI> make me laugh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>But—Miss Harriot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort, (to her.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush—let them alone—this will be a lesson for them—they think I don't hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mama, did you speak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes to Maria.</P>
<STAGE>(A short pause.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>When will this girl
<PB N="7" REF="034381_0102_0FFF0A55D4DE1638"/>
come?—I dare say she is afraid—she thinks she shall look awkward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy she is not much mistaken!</P>
<STAGE>(They laugh.)</STAGE>
<STAGE>(A rap is heard at the parlour door.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray come in.—Matilda open the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear mama, <HI>(laughs.)</HI>—Harriot, have done laughing.</P>
<STAGE>(Rosetta comes in, she curtsies mo∣destly. Her dress and manner should be plain, but not awk∣ward. Matilda and Harriot stare at her, and stifle a laugh.)</STAGE>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come in, my dear. I am very glad to see you, How do your father and mother?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta:</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, thank you, ma'am; they desired their respects to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very

much obliged to them.—Matilda, come and speak to Miss Rosetta, and take her bonnet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside to Harriot.)</STAGE>
<P>To wait upon her indeed.</P>
<STAGE>(She advances affectedly and proudly towards Rosetta.)</STAGE>
<P>How do you do, ma'am? I am glad to see you.—Give me leave to take your cloak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, ma'am; pray don't trouble yourself.</P>
<STAGE>(Matilda takes away her cloak, &amp;c. laughing aside at Harriot.—Rosetta sees them, blushes, and looks uneasy.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a fine day, Miss Rosetta.—The country be∣gins to look very pleasant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, ma'am.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort, (to Matilda.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Why don't you go and talk to Miss Rosetta.—I am ashamed of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda, (in a low voice.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear mama, what should I say to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fye, you silly child!—Maria come with me, I am going to dress; and by the time I return, I hope young people you will be better acquainted. Matilda, do all you can to amuse Miss Rosetta. Harriot, be sure you behave properly.</P>
<STAGE>(Mrs. Montfort, Maria go out.)</STAGE>
<STAGE>(A long pause, during which all the children look confused.)</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Harriot, (to Matilda.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Why don't you speak?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Matilda, (aloud.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Be quiet, Har∣riot, you are the most provoking child!</P>

<SP>

<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Child!—to be sure!</P>

<P>What, you think yourself a woman, I suppose, at nine years old!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, as well as you at ten?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such nonsense!—Miss Rosetta, will you like to look at my books?</P>

<P>If you please, ma'am.</P>

<STAGE>(shewing Rosetta the bandalore.)</STAGE>
<P>Is not this a very pretty thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you play with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know how.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot,</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(shewing her.)</STAGE>
<P>There you must let it fall, and then jerk the string a little—you see it winds up; there, you must keep it up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta,</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(trying.)</STAGE>
<P>Is that right▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="034381_0104_0FFF0F7B109C4DD8"/>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, very right; you will soon do it. O, but you must not jerk it so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you call it, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bandalore; some call them, Prince of Wales's toys.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, don't you know?—They are all the fashion. The Prince of Wales brought them in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are pretty, but there is no great ingenuity in play∣ing with them, I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, it is all a knack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like better a play, thing which requires more skill, or else is an exercise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you said, ma'am, you would shew me your books.</P>

<P>Yes, she does not seem stupid.</P>

<P>Oh, here is the Friend of Youth, and the Tales of the Castle.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, but my father says it is not proper for me.</P>

<P>Do you learn to dance?</P>

<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, ma'am.</P>

<P>Dear, not to dance!—oh, that is best of all; I love dancing. Harriot, let us dance Mr. Duport's Cadrille. Shall you like to see us?</P>

<P>Mrs. Barbauld's Hymns.</P>

<P>There is something in that to be sure. I suppose, if you learn how to make butter, and sell eggs, your father is satisfied?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harriot, that is a great fault, but it is a greater to be so eager to accuse your sister. My children, learn, that if you fail to conceal and excuse the errors of each other, the world will still more eagerly publish, and still more bitterly condemn them.—Where, alas! shall those who are faulty, look for pity and forgiveness, if not to those kindred bosoms who, knowing their failings, know also their virtues.—If we ourselves point the arrows of satire and re∣proach, at our sisters and our friends, who will hold before them the

<P>Oh, but you know sometimes we went to the State-House.</P>

<P>Oh dear how sad!—I should hate that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, it is fright∣ful indeed.—Sometimes we went to Harrow gate-gardens, which are charming, but not often.—Well, now we are in the country, we shall walk a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have charming walks.—If Mrs. Montfort will give me leave, I will shew them to you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, thank you, we shall like that vastly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps too you know how to plant flowers, and manage them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a large piece of garden, which I keep in order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, all yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, the man digs it, and puts it in order; I sow the feeds, water them, tie up the flow∣ers

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>How very agreeable!—What flowers have you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honeysuckles, roses, carnations, stocks, and a great va∣riety of others, and also a large bed of thyme for my bees.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your bees!—Have you bees also?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, three hives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, charming!—You are not afraid of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear no!—I never dis∣turb them, and they do not hurt me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they troublesome to keep?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. I have only to give them a little honey in the winter, to observe when they are going to swarm, and to provide a hive.</P>

<PB N="24" REF="034381_0111_0FFF0F8C11070628"/>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>To <HI>swarm</HI>—what is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>When the hive becomes too full, a great number of young bees go out of it, to find another place, where they make their comb and put the honey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where do they get the honey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the flowers. They suck it out with a sort of trunk; in passing through their bags it becomes honey. They also roll themselves in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> yellow dust of flowers, which makes the wax.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very curious!—You know all that!—We do not know any thing of the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, it is soon learned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should like to keep bees.</P>

<P>Yes, surely.</P>

<P>Oh, delightful!—Ro∣setta, what flower is this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>A larkspur—Here is another, of a different colour.—They are various in colour, and some are double.—They are annu∣als.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by annuals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>They last but one year.—the seed must be saved, and sow∣ed again. Most of our common flowers are annuals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but you forget

roses, honeysuckles, lilacs, and jas∣mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those are called flow∣ering shrubs.</P>

<P>How much you know!—We know nothing of all this!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, there is nothing more easy, when one lives in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have been taught all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all; I need on∣ly observe.—I do not need telling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>And we know nothing but what we are taught.—And yet we fancy ourselves very wise!—No wonder your time is employed!—What else do you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>I work a great deal.—I read whenever I can: I make cakes, and pastry: I help to gather the fruit in season, and to cull flowers and herbs for distilling: I
<PB N="27" REF="034381_0112_0FFF0F8F162FF650"/>
manage the poultry-yard, and over∣look the dairy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, how clever you are!—I wish I could do so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing clev∣er in that; I only do my duty.—You are differently situated, you have no need of these things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all that, they are more useful.—But if we did what mama wishes us, that would be enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure it is.—You do, I dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.—Mama wishes us to read more; not to be conceited; to spend less time idly; to talk less ourselves, and attend more to other people.—Not to be imperti∣nent; and above all not to quarrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, you obey such reasonable, and kind com∣mands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="034381_0113_0FFF0F90BA6BA488"/>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—when we re∣member!—But to-day—I see now how foolishly I have behaved!—How ignorant, I fancied you were, because you could not dance and sing!—How I chattered to you without attending to what you said!—Then I was very impertinent to you, and quarrelled with Harriot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Miss Matil∣da, how I love you for owning your faults!—You will soon mend them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah!—I fear not!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, since you know them so well!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>You allow, then, I have faults; I love you for that: every body else, except Mama, my Governess, and Maria flatter me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>To flatter!—Oh, how vile!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do they not flatter you?—</P>
</SP>

<P>No, surely; I should

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you are right; I shall be more cautious in future.—Rosetta promise to tell me when I am wrong.</P>

<P>Ah! have you not a mother, much more capable than I am of telling you?</P>

<P>Yes, certainly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> often as she can make it conve∣nient to come to you.—At all yours, my dear Rosetta; if the chil∣dren are taking their lessons, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all not disturb themselves; you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill not perhaps be sorry to be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e party.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, indeed, mama!—She knows so much; she understands flowers, and how to keep bees, and to make cakes, and many other things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not all.—She helps her mother
<PB N="32" REF="034381_0115_0FFF0F95AA413AF0"/>
to instruct her sisters, in working reading, and writing.—Besides the assistance she gives in houshold af∣fairs, she works excellently we at her needle.—She is fond of read∣ing, and has greatly improved by it.—I beg your pardon, Rosetta for commending you to your face but I wish to give my children lesson, who fancied this morning, because you had not the same ad∣vantages with themselves; you must be ignorant and awk ward. They now see you are neither; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> begin to know how much mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> valuable and useful are your em∣ployments than theirs.</P>

<P>Indeed, ma'am, the young ladies were not mistaken; am <HI>very</HI> ignorant.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very modest; which will, I hope, be another lesson to them.—Beside
<PB N="33" REF="034381_0115_0FFF0F95AA413AF0"/>
Matilda, Miss Rosetta is not de∣ficient in those lighter accomplish∣ments which you admire so much.—She has taught herself to design landscapes, and to paint flowers, charmingly well, and she also sings very agreeably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Rosetta, can you sing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>But—very little indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did not say so this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>You only asked me, if I had <HI>learn'd;</HI> and, I said, I had not; which is true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mama, I am quite convinced of what you have so of∣ten told me, that by chatting so much, attending so much to my∣self, and so little to other people, I lose a great deal of pleasure and instruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.—If you
<PB N="34" REF="034381_0116_0FFF0F999CB2D128"/>
had not chosen to display what you fancied your superiority, in danc∣ing and singing, to Miss Rosetta, you would earlier have learnt her merit, and the power she has of teaching you many useful and a∣greeable things.—You would have saved yourself the pain of being impertinent to her, and me the mortification of seeing you rude, saucy, and conceited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mama—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, you were all these!—But, hence for∣ward, Matilda, I hope you will reflect, that the light frivolous ac∣complishments you have boasted of so much, are in reality of no essen∣tial import, since they neither make us more wise, more humble, or more pleasing in our behaviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>But mama, do you not
<PB N="35" REF="034381_0116_0FFF0F999CB2D128"/>
then wish us to learn singing and dancing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.—It is a duty incumbent on you to learn them, because I wish it, and be∣cause they are ornamental parts of education, suited to the place you are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill in life.—But I would not have you fancy they make you at all superior to those whose situ∣ation excludes them from such in∣formation.—You will do very wrong not to learn them, but you have no merit in possessing them, as every other person would do the same, if they had the same oppor∣tunity.—And I would have you always consider, that one precept which teaches you to improve your behaviour, or regulate your temper, is of more value than the finest singing, or most graceful dancing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="034381_0117_0FFF0F9B300E3348"/>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure you are right, mama.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even superior acquirements ought not to render you proud or conceited.—If you read more, or write better, than o∣ther children of your age; if you know better how to behave, or have better qualities, you ought to reflect that all have not equal advantages with yourself.—Every child has not a father, who can or will be at the expence of having her well in∣structed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, mama, nor has every child a mother who takes such pains in teaching her!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true,—Learn then to make allowances for differences of natural capacity, which we have no merit in posses∣sing, as we did not give it to our∣selves; and for difference of edu∣cation,
<PB N="37" REF="034381_0117_0FFF0F9B300E3348"/>
which depends on those a∣bout us,—When these allowances are made, we shall seldom, if ever, find any thing to ridicule or des∣pise; pity, and a wish to amend, will be our only sentiments.—And when we consider how many oppor∣tunities we have ourselves lost, how much more we might have learned, than we have learned, we may easily allow for those who have even lost more time than ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, mama, I feel how much you are in the right; and I promise you henceforth to be more attentive, and less presuming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I also, indeed, mama.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rosetta.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, ma'ma, let me too thank you for these valuable in∣structions; which, I hope, will be also profitable to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Montfort.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a very
<PB N="38" REF="034381_0118_0FFF0F9CEA54AB80"/>

<P>Sir, while I was able by the work of my hands, to pro∣cure for my wife and children the means of life, I had no right to

encroach upon the goodness of others, or on that relief which poorer wtetches had a better right to.—But when my strength failed me; when I saw myself on the point of being deprived of work, and my children of bread, it became time to ask, and God has been pleas∣ed that I should not ask in vain.</P>

my father died; soon after, I married that dear woman you have seen.—She was of good family, but had no fortune; mine was sufficient for us both, but fond as I was of my Agnes, desiring to pro∣cure for her every indulgence, I lived to the extent of my income, and far beyond her wishes: for five years we lived happily, when a distant relation of the person from whom my father had bought the estate, pretending a fault in the title, laid claim to it; the cause was tried, and by an artifice my chief witness kept out of court. I lost my cause, and was left desti∣tute; my relations excusing them∣selves on account of my marrying, as they called it, imprudently, and my living expensively, refused me any assistance, and with the rest of my friends, turned their back<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon me.</P>

<P>One friend alone was left, who received us into his house, and would have procured a re-hear∣ing of our cause, but he died, and we were sent forth to wander through the world. I hired this cottage, where, by the labour of my hands, I have supported my wife, that dear consoling angel, who has never once reproached me for the misery I have brought upon her, and our children; till her sickness drove me almost to dis∣traction and despair, from which Heaven sent you this day to relieve me.</P>

Happily, as I have married my daughter

<HEAD>THE Mocking Bird's Nest.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>IT being the season when the Spring Vacation took place at school, which interval Mrs. <HI>Wood∣field</HI> embraced for enjoying with her little family the delights of a rural retreat. The beauty of the country daily increased; the spring was mild and forward. Her little boys William and Thomas had left school about ten days.</P>
<P>Their sisters and their little fe∣male kinsfolk were now employed for some hours every morning in assisting to repair the children's
<PB N="2" REF="034381_0154_0FFF0FF5B83BFF00"/>
linen, or making up new against their return to school, after the vacation.</P>
<P>The first day after their arrival, the boys amused themselves by walking through the woods, which were already in leaf. The reluct∣ant oak and the timid ash, no lon∣ger resisting the warmth of the sun, were rapidly unfolding their fresh leaves. The hedges and under∣wood were every where green and afforded concealment and shelter to an infinite number of birds, now busy in building their nests.</P>
<P>In the course of their walk, little Thomas, who had wandered on be∣fore, came running back out of breath, without his hat, which he held in his hand, and in which, with delight sparkling in his eyes, he showed his brother a nest of young unfledged birds.</P>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="034381_0154_0FFF0FF5B83BFF00"/>
<SPEAKER>Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, William! see my dear William, what a nest of birds! The boys there, that have taken them, say they are mocking-birds. Mamma, tell me if I may buy them? They ask only twenty-five cents for them. I will give half of them to William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mamma, are they mocking birds? May we have them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I am afraid they <HI>are</HI> mocking birds: and they <HI>are</HI> so tender, that you will never be able to raise them, so that to take them seems to be wanton cruelty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>But mamma, these <HI>are</HI> taken already; and I am sure, if they are the tenderest little things in the world, my sister Matilda will nurse them up. Don't you remember how she nursed the young
<PB N="4" REF="034381_0155_0FFF0FF7443992D0"/>
yellow-birds, which the cat threw down from the peach tree in the garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor, little, unfortunate creatures! see how they pant! I have no other objection to your buying them, my dear Wil∣liam, than as I think it encourages idle boys to continue their cruel robberies on the birds. But, how∣ever, as these poor mocking birds <HI>are</HI> prisoners, I believe we may rescue them out of worse hands, by taking them into ours. Can the boys there tell you where they took them from; perhaps, after they are out of sight, we may be able to put them back into the tree where they were hatched.</P>

<SPEAKER>Thomas.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(returning to his mo∣ther.)</HI> Mamma, the boys say they got this nest out of a cherry-tree, quite in the very middle of the wood, almost a mile off; and they don't believe they can find the place for ever so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my loves, then pay for your purchase, and we will do the best we can with it. Your luckless little captives will soon be hungry, and we shall find nothing to give them here; there∣fore, I would have you Jane, with your two uncles, go home, and find a secure cage for your mocking birds, which must still, however, remain in the nest; and let your maid Rachael, assist you in feed∣ing them, as she is fond of such things, and understands something of them. Matilda, Eliza, and I, shall continue our walk, as I have
<PB N="6" REF="034381_0156_0FFF0FF97B115298"/>

<P>He will be an excellent nurse to them, and so will William, as far as their judg∣ment goes; but these unfortunate objects of childish tenderness are not unfrequently killed by kind∣ness. Neither of my little fellows have that disposition to cruelty which is said to be inherent in hu∣man nature, and which I have sometimes thought really is so, however degrading the idea may be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure I have thought so, very often, when I have seen how cruel some people are to animals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed, not
<PB N="7" REF="034381_0156_0FFF0FF97B115298"/>
only humiliating, but it is to my feelings so distressing, that I seldom have passed through any great towns, without seeing some in∣stance of human cruelty and animal suffering that has dwelt upon my mind, and affected my spirits for the rest of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it <HI>impossible</HI> to punish such horrid monsters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sufferings of these miserable victims of human barbarity have not been, and there∣fore, I suppose, cannot be suffici∣ently attended to by the legislature. An hackney-coach-man may whip his galled and tired horse with im∣punity, though the exhausted ani∣mal has not strength to execute the task his brutal driver demands of him; for what positive law is there against a man's whipping his horses? or how shall his manage∣ment
<PB N="8" REF="034381_0157_0FFF0FFBEF4574A8"/>
of them be regulated. Were I a man, I am persuaded I should turn knight-errant in defence of the mere animal, against what are im∣properly called reasonable beings. How beautifully does the inimitable COWPER treat this subject! Speak∣ing of the domestic animal depend∣ant on man, he says,—
<Q><L>They prove too often at how dear a rate</L>
<L>He fells protection. Witness at his foot</L>
<L>The Spaniel dying for some venial fault,</L>
<L>Under dissection of the knotted scourge:</L>
<L>Witness the patient ox, with stripes and yells</L>
<L>Driven to the slaughter, goaded, as he runs,</L>
<L>To madness; while the savage at his heels</L>
<L>Laughs at the frantic sufferer's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury spent</L>
<L>Upon the guiltless passenger o'erthrown.</L>
<L>He, too, is witness, noblest of the train</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="034381_0157_0FFF0FFBEF4574A8"/>
That wait on man, the fleet performing horse</L>
<L>With unsuspecting readiness he takes</L>
<L>His murderer on his back; and push'd all day,</L>
<L>With bleeding sides, and flanks that heave for life,</L>
<L>To the far distant goal arrives—and dies.</L>
<L>Does LAW, so jealous in the cause of man,</L>
<L>Denounce no loom on the delinquent?—<HI>None.</HI></L></Q>
And alas! this is one of those evils that satire, excellent and just even as this is, can do but little to cor∣rect; for, as some periodical work, (I think the World,) in one of its essays, observes, coachmen, dray∣men, cartmen, and drovers, do not read essays; yet I have often fancied that something might be done to soften the cruel hearts of the lower classes of people, if any person of abilities would adopt re∣monstrances to their comprehension,
<PB N="10" REF="034381_0158_0FFF0FFE59850908"/>
and teach them to fear hereafter such punishments as they now in∣flict, in dreadful retaliation.</P>
<P>They were by this time arrived at the village, whose few strag∣gling houses edged the extensive wood, and in a neat cottage found a decently dressed woman, whose husband was a farmer, and who was employed by Mrs. Woodfield to spin for her. She desired the woman to bring out some flax in its raw state; described the pro∣cess of making it into tow, fit for spinning, and then made each of the girls spin a thread. Not far from thence, in the same village, was a loom; they there saw it woven into sheeting and other coarse linen. Their walk home was designedly varied. Mrs. Wood∣field led them across a rustic bridge, and along the banks of a rapid stream that turned a paper-mill,
<PB N="11" REF="034381_0158_0FFF0FFE59850908"/>
into which they entered, and saw the whole operation of making se∣veral kinds of paper. She then ex∣plained to them the materials and means by which it was made; and bade them carry their imagination back, from the stalk of the flax they had seen, bearing a blue and simple flower trembling on its slen∣der summit, through all its changes and modifications till it contributes to make a sheet of paper.</P>
<P>This speculation amused them for the rest of their walk. On their arrival at home, Matilda and Eliza, were agreeably surprised by a card they found upon their table, from a gentleman of their acquaint∣ance, inviting the whole family to one of Mr. Duport's much admired Fancy Balls.</P>
<P>Pleasure danced in the eyes of Matilda, when she found Mrs.
<PB N="12" REF="034381_0159_0FFF100093039D60"/>
Woodfield intended to return an answer that they would accept this invitation. Nor was Eliza much less delighted. An immediate con∣sultation was held as to the arrange∣ment necessary; and Mrs. Wood∣field, leaving them to enjoy this antepast of pleasure, (all that life's deception frequently allow as to taste, and which is at their ages so keenly tasted,) went to inspect the little menagerie of the three young∣er children, lately increased by their mocking birds, about which they were anxiously employed. It was more necessary to repress their ill-judged solicitude, than to reprove them for carelessness of their little charge. But desirous of teaching them to reflect, she made use of the present opportunity; when the eldest of the two boys said, "Mamma, I do not believe
<PB N="13" REF="034381_0159_0FFF100093039D60"/>
these little birds would be more comfortable if they were with their own mother."</P>

<P>Just so must the birds' mother feel, when she re∣turns and finds the vacant bough from which her nest has been torn. But, to impress this more forcibly on your memory, <HI>William,</HI> you shall learn by rote, and write these lines in your copy-book:
<Q><L>Oft when returning with her loaded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>Th' astonished mother finds a vacant nest,</L>

<L>Her pinions ruffle, and, low drooping, scarce</L>
<L>Can bear the mourner to the poplar shade.</L></Q></P>

<P><HI>(with tears starting in his eyes.)</HI> Mamma, if I had thought about what the old bird must feel,
<PB N="15" REF="034381_0160_0FFF10046B3FF5E0"/>
I would have made the boys I bought them of, put the nest back again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had done so, my dear little boy, it would hardly, in this case, have answer∣ed your humane intention; for those idle boys, as soon as you are out of sight, would have taken the nest again, and have sold the poor birds to some other person. What I mean is, not only to induce you to take care of them, since they now depend on you, but to engage you, in every case, to put yourself in the place of whatever creature you are about to injure or oppress; that you may acquire a habit of saying to yourself, How should I like to be treated thus? What should I suffer, if I were in the place of the cat we are wantonly hunting with our terriers? of the robbins which
<PB N="16" REF="034381_0161_0FFF100612B40A48"/>
we are wounding with our arrows? of the ducks we are setting the spaniels at? Whoever learns early in life to make these reflexions, will never have a reproach to make himself on the score of humanity, either towards the animal, or the human species.</P>

<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, mamma, grown people hunt, and shoot, and fish, and do not seem to think there is any cruelty in it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far as it be∣comes necessary to kill for our sup∣port, the animals Providence has allotted for us, there is nothing criminal in it; but to prolong their tortures is highly so, or want only to destroy any living creatures that are innoxious. For to-morrow's task, Thomas shall write out for me these lines, on the subject of inferior animals, and even reptiles and insects:
<Q><PB N="17" REF="034381_0161_0FFF100612B40A48"/>
<L>—If man's convenience, health.</L>
<L>Or safety interfere, his rights and claims</L>
<L>Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs;</L>
<L>Else they are all, the meanest things that are,</L>
<L>As free to live and to enjoy that life,</L>
<L>As God was free to form them at the first,</L>
<L>Who in his sovereign wisdom made them all▪</L>
<L>Ye, therefore, who love mercy, teach your sons to love it too.—</L></Q>
And now, my dear boys, you must release your niece Jane, for she is going out to-morrow evening, and I fancy has some little preparation to make. My dear Jane, follow me.</P>

<P>That are not twaddles and quizzes, and grubs and goodies, and half an hundred other odd names, that you give to the folks you usually meet with in the country. Tell me now, Ma∣tilda, if it would not have afforded you great pleasure, had you known
<PB N="19" REF="034381_0162_0FFF100874876728"/>
of this ball soon enough, to have written s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily to your fashionable friend, Miss Freemantle, to have sent you some very whimsical dress, with a new name, such as you ima∣gine, having never been seen in this country, would make people stare?</P>

<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should not have ven∣tured to have done it without your leave.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, however, it would have given you pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; I should not like to appear any where but properly dressed, if I could help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>And after all, what is so proper for a young per∣son of your age, as perfect simplicity and neatness? You are still in mourning, and would not, I hope▪ have thrown it off an hour sooner on account of this public ball.</P>

<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>But all I am afraid of is, that if one is not a little fashion∣able, one looks vulgar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is infinitely more vulgar to appear at such an assembly over-drest. Believe me, my dear, mere dress contributes nothing to that look of elegance, or, if you will, of superiority, that you seem so jealous of. You will be convinced of this, if you should see to-morrow evening, as you probably will, a lady, named Scarfton, who is the first and finest at all our public balls; she is the wife of a man in trade of conside∣rable credit, who is often to Great Britain, as he is engaged in business there. This woman, who is ex∣tremely homely, is the greatest adept in fashions I ever saw. She runs about for a week before the commencement of the public assem∣blies,
<PB N="21" REF="034381_0163_0FFF100ADC24F8A8"/>
from milliner to milliner, to see other ladies' cloaths, and then imagines something like the most remarkable, with which to induce some attention towards her. Her cloaths are made up in every vari∣ety of extravagant fashion, and each habiliment has some out-land∣ish name that she cannot even pro∣nounce. Without the least regard to proportion or propriety, she dressess out her unfortunate person in the wildest mode of the wildest girl of fashion, and the effect is, that she creates envy in the weak, and pity in the wise; and, while she thinks herself on the very pin∣nacle of politeness and elegance, I see some look upon her as a mad woman, and all consider her as bordering on insanity. Have you any ambition, Matilda, to share, with such a woman as Mrs. Scarf∣ton,
<PB N="22" REF="034381_0164_0FFF100EB80965E0"/>
the state of public amazement?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Woodfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hear no more, then of wishes to know what <HI>they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear.</HI> My mantua-ma∣ker, who makes cloaths for such as are esteemed fashionable, often forces me to smile, by advising me to have my gown made so and so, assuring me <HI>they wear</HI> them so: and when I ask <HI>who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> she simper∣ingly informs me, that Miss K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty Doeskin, daughter of Mr. Doe∣skin, an eminent leather dresser, and Miss Clutterbucks, daughter of Mr. Clutterbucks, green-grocer and dealer, have had new dresses from London, <HI>"quite in taste,"</HI> which they have given me leave to look at.</P>
</SP>
<P>Such are the histories of <HI>fashions.</HI> The belles, who derive their in∣formation
<PB N="23" REF="034381_0164_0FFF100EB80965E0"/>
from the Miss Doeskins and the Miss Clutterbucks, will take the lead in elegance, till Mrs. Scarfton's husband arrives next from London, then the ton of articles a la Does<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins and Clutterbucks, will be entirely superseded by the know∣ledge acquired by the happier few, who, are admitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> contem∣pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the superior elegance of the lady's of that house.</P>
<P>Do you think, Matilda, such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemeron triumphs as these, are worth a moment's thought? I am far, however, from wishing you entirely to decline appearing in what is called in the fashion; such affection would be as ridiculous on one hand, as running into its wildest excesses is on the other. A young woman should dress as the persons of her age dress, but with∣out sacrificing decency, common
<PB N="24" REF="034381_0165_0FFF10104F31A600"/>
sense, or proportion. Nothing, perhaps, is a more glaring absur∣dity, among all the weaknesses women are charged with, than the undistinguishing avidity with which women of all ranks, ages and fi∣gures, run into modes of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss that neither suits the person or pockets of all, and probably disfigures five out of six. Some slender girl of fashion imagines, in the caprice of imputed perfections, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manner of dressing which shall show every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne of those perfections. It succeeds; the men compliment, the Misses envy, and the mob wonder. In a few days, the fat red-faced matron of fifty; the dwarfish Miss, who has owed her little consequence to her heels and her head; the round snug damsel, as thick as she is long; and the <HI>genteel young lady,</HI> that has lived on vinegar till she is reduced
<PB N="25" REF="034381_0165_0FFF10104F31A600"/>
to a study for an anatomist: all follow the fashion: but hardly are they established in it, before some other, more preposterous succeeds; and the former,
<Q><L>Like the baseless fabric of a vision,</L>
<L>Leaves not a wreck behind;</L></Q>
unless it be in that description of persons who, in Shakespeare's time were called,</P>
<P>The velvet guards, and Sunday citizens.</P>
<P>I have often thought, that if were possible to have a set of dolls dressed in the fashions of the last two hundred years, it would be an amusing spectacle, and not without its use, as a lesson to human vanity. The modes are now forgotten, and the names of the triflers who in∣vented them are forgotten too; the only memorial that remains of ei∣ther exists, perhaps, in some book,
<PB N="26" REF="034381_0166_0FFF1011D80A9E08"/>
where they are accidentally alluded to, and which the commentary of the antiquarian and the critic may have explained.</P>
<P>It should be a lesson to the span∣gled butterfly of the passing day, and it should teach her the superi∣ority of Intellect over Beauty, when she reflects, that the charms of so many lovely women live now only in the memory of mankind by the poets who have celebrated their names. Even the beautiful Lady Coventry is obliged to Mason for telling us what she was. "The liquid lustre of her eyes," is thought of but faintly by those who read of the incomparably fascinating charms that graced her person. There is a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnet of Drayton's ad∣dressed to a lady, whose merit he glories in being able to rescue from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which is apposite to this
<PB N="27" REF="034381_0166_0FFF1011D80A9E08"/>
topic. It is not so polished as mo∣dern poetry; but is highly ex∣pressive of his opinion of the power of poesy, and of those objects of transient admiration, of whom it has been said, THEY had no POET and THEY died.</P>
