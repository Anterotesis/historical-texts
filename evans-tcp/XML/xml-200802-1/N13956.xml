<P>THE imperfection of human nature, and the mutability of worldly things, have given birth to frequent changes, and revolutions, in kingdoms and empires. These revolutions, are necessarily attended with striking scenes and events, that command the at∣tention, and frequently excite the wonder of the world. They also necessarily exhibit to public view, a variety of characters, especially of such persons as were formed by nature for heroic atchievements; the final issue best determines, to whom the good or evil principally belongs.</P>
<P>No doubt the providence of GOD has wise and good purposes to answer, by these things; and his hand that guides and directs them, in their most secret causes and operations, will be
<PB N="6" REF="017655_0004_0FA212DE8B3E1128"/>
devoutly acknowledged, by the thoughtful and the wise.</P>
<P>SENTIMENTS of this kind are naturally sug∣gested, from the glorious American Revolution, which in the course of nature, and by the will of Heaven, has opened in our day.</P>
<P>WE have seen great events produced from causes but small in human view: we have pla∣ces in various parts of the continent famed as theatres of bloody battles: we have a large num∣ber of names recorded for patriots and heroes; and the important scene, yet open on the Ame∣rican stage, commands the attention and wonder of the world.</P>
<P>THIS day, and the public appearances of it, impress our minds with an affecting remem∣brance of a signal event, a most tragical scene that opened in this place, from which the alarm of war was founded thro' the land.</P>
<P>THE battle of Lexington, will not only mark a distinguished page in the history of this war, but be remembered, and mentioned, with in∣dignation to British cruelty, and with reproach to the man that ordered, and the officers that executed the bloody orders, so long as proper feelings of humanity, shall possess the human heart. We well remember our feelings on that
<PB N="7" REF="017655_0005_0FA212DF45284C18"/>
day; nor shall we ever forget them: the inha∣bitants of this town must have undergone more than can be well expressed; and the friends of those who fell victims to British cruelty and murder, must still have aching hearts.</P>
<P>THE religious observance of this anniversary, with martial appearances on the day, do honor to the town, and the cause of our country,—"For this day shall be unto you for a memorial."</P>
<P>THOUGH it is our duty to impress our minds with a proper recollection of the day, and its transactions, which gave birth to this anniversary, and devoutly acknowledge the hand of Provi∣dence, in restraining the wrath and rage of our enemies, and disappointing their base designs: yet it may not be necessary for me, at this time, to go over the particular transactions of that day, or attempt a description of its horrors and distres∣ses, which fell so heavily on the people of this place. In judgment, GOD remembered mercy: and among other favours in Providence, you had your faithful pastor to advise and comfort you, and lead in your devotions to GOD; and on eve∣ry return of the anniversary, have devoutly ac∣knowledged the hand of GOD. A religious ac∣knowledgment of GOD and his Providence, is certainly the duty of a christian people, under all changes and events: and to possess a frame of mind that corresponds with the measures of Pro∣vidence, is a noble attainment in religion.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017655_0006_0FA212E00043DB18"/>
THE day and its events we are commemora∣ting, lead to, and are interwoven with a series of wonders, involving our highest interests and concerns; and also those of posterity.</P>
<P>THE finger of GOD has indeed been so conspicu∣ous in every stage of our glorious struggle, that it seems as if the wonders and miracles performed for Israel of old, were repeated over anew for the American Israel, in our day. The hardness that possessed the heart of Pharaoh of old, seems to have calloussed the heart of the British King; and the madness that drove that antient tyrant and his hosts into the sea, appears to have pos∣sessed the British court and councils, and to have driven them and their forces to measures, that, in human view, must terminate in their own confusion and ruin: and this in spite of the council and advice of the prudent and wise; and the repeated prayers and intreaties of the poor and oppressed Americans.</P>
<P>AS the powers of nature, under the command of GOD, operated in favour of Israel of old; the stars in their courses fought against their enemies; the sun stopped in its course, that Israel might com∣pleat their victory, kings and armies were con∣quered and subdued before them: So a most astonishing concurrence of causes, under the di∣rection of the same unerring wisdom, have con∣spired to bring about the American revolution,
<PB N="9" REF="017655_0007_0FA212E0DCE4E190"/>
Canaan was for a long time, a land of rest and liberty for GOD'S people of old: so we have our raised hopes and expectations this day, that our land will soon become a quiet habitation, an assylum to the oppressed throughout the world, and the joy of the whole earth.</P>
<P>IN miraculous productions, we see and own the hand of GOD, but are apt to disregard it, in common events; forgetting that the providence of GOD ought as much to be owned and ac∣knowledged by us in events which we can trace from their natural causes, as in prodigies, or mi∣raculous productions, that appear to be the im∣mediate effect of the almighty power of GOD. And as this, we generally say, is not the age of miracles, there is somehow, a strange and sinful insensibility to the interposition and agency of GOD, which too generally possesses our minds. We stop at second causes, but forget GOD, the great and first cause of all: we admire the he∣roism of the general; we praise the valour and bravery of the soldier;—but forget that salva∣tion is of the LORD.</P>
<P>THE whole of our arduous struggle, is indeed but a scene of wonder and amazement; exhibit∣ing the most striking marks of the interposition and agency of GOD. However politicians have been employed, the ambition and anger of men been raised, and the greatest exertions of hu∣man
<PB N="10" REF="017655_0008_0FA212E18B998738"/>
power put forth; yet as sober men and christians, it becomes us to look above all these things, and acknowledge and adore the hand of Providence.</P>
<P>THE time, it seems, was come, the full pe∣riod commenced, appointed by the councils of Heaven, in the course of nature, when a new Empire should arise in the world, and a nation be born in a day; that wisdom which governs the world, determines events, and driveth asun∣der the nations, prepared the causes in the natu∣ral, the moral, and political world to unite their forces and accomplish the great event. Hence a spirit of liberty must stimulate this large peo∣ple, and like a spreading torrent flow over the land: the passions of men must be aroused: the sword, which is never wantonly used but by ty∣rants, robbers and madmen, must be drawn; and to the reproach of humanity, scenes of blood and carnage must ensue:—Alliances must be formed, and battles fought, that the foundation of the new Empire, like most others in the world, might be laid in blood;—a foundation sadly ominous of its future overthrow and ruin, which, in their turn and order, will be the fate of all the kingdoms and empires of the world.</P>
<P>IT is certainly a memorable Providence, that in the beginning of the controversy, such a spirit of liberty should so generally fill the land. The
<PB N="11" REF="017655_0009_0FA212E24007A508"/>
nations of Europe, it seems, for a long time, have been much lost to a sense of liberty. As to many of them, the body of the people are but lit∣tle better than slaves to their princes and kings: long inured to oppression, they have become in∣sensible to their yoke, as the stupid ass to the burthen it carries. But the sons of America had not yet lost the noble spirit of their ancestors, and therefore disdained to be the slaves of Bri∣tain. Not dismayed by threatenings, or dangers, they engaged in the arduous work, determined to be free; and have exhibited examples of uni∣on, virtue, perseverance and heroism, that are mentioned with admiration throughout the world. In following the steps of Providence, our duty has been pointed out from time to time; and favourable events succeeding one another, we are at length conducted, by the hand of a kind Providence, within fight of the great object of our toils.</P>
<P>As the original source of the American revo∣lution, under Providence, was that sense of li∣berty, which was so universally impressed on the minds of this people, it ought in reason to be viewed as a special interposition of Providence, from whose dominions the hearts of men are not exempted.</P>
<P>THIS great principle of liberty formed a u∣nion, which neither the power nor policy of Bri∣tain
<PB N="12" REF="017655_0010_0FA212E31A5CA070"/>
have been able to break: a union, which has been constantly strengthening and increasing, e∣ven from those very measures that were design∣ed by our enemies to confound and destroy it. Not only our own dangers and distresses, but e∣ven the successes and cruelties of our enemies, have conspired, under Providence, to cement this people in a band of union, which at this day may defy the rage and power of tyrants; "for it is now consolidated by a confederation happi∣ly compleated." Thus united and bound, these American States, in a collective view, form a large empire, which bids fair, in the course of nature, to exceed all the empires of the world; they spread over an amazing extent of country, that by rapid population is daily filling with in∣habitants. It is not improbable but the exten∣sive countries of Canada and Nova Scotia will ere long be joined in the union: nor is it impos∣sible but the West-India islands, from their local situation, may, in some future period, become the property of these American States. Alas! what surprising productions, what extensive prospects, has this great spirit of liberty, under Providence produced?</P>
<P>VERY observable have been the interpositions of Providence, in raising up, for us, numerous and powerful friends. Even in Britain, and in the British court, persons of the highest reputa∣tion for virtue and knowledge, have owned the
<PB N="13" REF="017655_0011_0FA212E3C53AB308"/>
justice of our cause, and done much to assist and support it: by their friendly aid, we re∣ceived from time to time, notice of the designs and plans of our enemy, a circumstance of high importance and utility.</P>
<P>BUT our greatest human friend and supporter is, His Most Christian Majesty the King of France, whom that GOD who has the hearts of kings in his hands, disposed to enter into a most generous alliance with these States; and he has given us the strongest evidences of his sincerity and friendship. From such a power∣ful ally we have indulged raised hopes and ex∣pectations, and have experienced eminent and important services, that have even exceeded our expectations. We well know our absolute need of this foreign aid, and the many ways in which we have felt the benefit of it; but I fear we are not in general so mindful of the hand of Divine Providence, in this particular, as we ought in justice to be.</P>
<P>THAT a nation of different manners, different language and religion, and with minds barred against us, by national prejudices, which, like national habits, are stubborn and incurable by human art and address, should at once form so open, friendly, and generous an alliance, with these poor and oppressed States; that their armies and forces should harmonize with ours, like bre∣thren
<PB N="14" REF="017655_0012_0FA212E482FC9A48"/>
in a common cause; and all ranks of men among them, so highly interest themselves in our concerns, and so freely shed their blood in our cause, discovers the hand of Providence, the kind influence of heaven; and it is much too great a compliment to human wisdom and abi∣lities, to consider them as the sole causes of such great events.</P>
<P>FROM education and prejudice, we have ge∣nerally been trained up from our cradles, to con∣ceive unfavourably of the French nation. We viewed them as a kind of natural enemy, and such were our feelings towards them: and hence it is not so much to be wondered at, that some among us appeared to be so insensible to the vast importance of our alliance with France. However, a number of real facts abundantly convince us of our error and mistake, and prove our prejudices to be ill founded. And from the best authority and information, as well as from our own experience, we are now induced to view and esteem the French by far the most polished, humane, and generous people in the world. Their naval force, which from time to time has been sent to America, has undoubt∣edly prevented our enemies from burning our seat-port towns: and their troops, united with the American arms, under the command of our illustrious General the last year, effected the greatest and most happy event of the war; a
<PB N="15" REF="017655_0013_0FA212E541FFDF10"/>
victory that will make as brilliant a figure in his∣tory as any to be met with, either in ancient or modern wars.</P>
<P>A FRIEND in need, is a friend in deed. At this day we both see our need of this friendly aid, and feel the happy effects of it; greater foreign assistance we could not expect; that to be insensible of their kindness, must expose us to be reproached with base ingratitude; and not to acknowledge the hand of Providence in this alliance, must bring upon us the guilt of great impiety.</P>
<P>MEMORABLE have been the interpositions of Providence, in blasting and counteracting the designs of our enemy, and in discovering and de∣tecting their mean and wicked plots and in∣treagues. We have often seen their councils turned into foolishness, and their secret machi∣nations detected. When their open violence has proved abortive, they have frequently at∣tempted to effect their purpose by fraud and de∣ceit. As if despairing of success from their troops, they have had recourse to traitors among ourselves. Nay, so great is their malice and rancour, they would undoubtedly, with wicked Saul of old, in the hour of despair, readily go to the witch of Endor, if they might but ob∣tain their point; but there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination
<PB N="16" REF="017655_0014_0FA212E7B5CDED00"/>
against Israel, according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, what hath GOD wrought? The same overruling Providence that blasted their open force, has detected their secret fraud.</P>
<P>THERE have been, also, signal appearances of Providence in our favour, in times of our greatest distress and danger. When our ene∣mies have had their greatest triumphs, and we of consequence our darkest hours, some of our greatest deliverances and victories have been sent. So signal have been the measures of divine pro∣vidence, that the greatest prosperity and succes∣ses of our enemy, seem to have been ordered, to prepare them for a greater overthrow; this is the doing of the Lord, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</P>
<P>EVERY prop our enemy seem to have de∣pended upon, has failed them in its turn. They have sent their secret emisaries among us, to bribe and deceive, but it did not avail. They some∣times hoped for factions among ourselves, and did all in their power to foment them, but have been happily disappointed. They much ex∣pected our money would fail us, but have the mortification to see their own money supporting our cause. They once thought we could do no∣thing at fighting, for the want of arms, but now find from woful experience, that we fight them, and beat them, with their own arms.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="017655_0015_0FA212E840501FB8"/>
IT not their last, yet their greatest hopes and dependence appear to have been placed upon a General, differently distinguished in Britain and America; there by his high birth and fame; here by his shocking inhumanity and cruelty, who was permitted for a time, greatly to annoy and distress our brethren in the southern states: but blessed be God, that General, with his whole army, are now prisoners in our hands. Verily the Lord has done great things for us, the Lord has triumphed gloriously.</P>
<P>FROM a series of favourable events, and the present aspects of providence; from the succes∣ses of our arms; the completion of our union; the favourable change of our currency; the fee∣ble state of our enemy; and the despair of those mistaken and wretched men, that are denomi∣nated tories, we cannot but entertain raised hopes that our deliverance is just at hand, and the blessings of peace will soon be restored, and our independence secured; when this land of liberty will become a quiet habitation; the wilderness blossom like a rose; commerce and agriculture flourish; the arts and sciences be cultivated; and generations yet unborn shall rejoice in the happy purchases of our treasure and blood.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding the great things which God has done, and is doing for us, and the plea∣sing prospect before us, we hear from some few
<PB N="18" REF="017655_0016_0FA212E9020DF0A0"/>
the voice of complaint and the growls of avarice; and the general subject is, the burden of taxes. Alas! my christian friends, what is money, to the great blessings of liberty? to be freed from the jaws of tyranny, to live in freedom ourselves, and leave our posterity after us free, are bles∣sings of infinitely more value than all the wealth of the world. The kindness of heaven, and the bounties of providence bestowed upon us, are enough to hush and suppress every uneasy senti∣ment of this kind, where there is the least spark of ingenuity or public spirit. Had we lost all our wealth, but preserved our liberty, we should have been great gainers; but by the kindness of heaven, we may preserve them both.</P>
<P>IT is true, our taxes are heavy, and demands for our exertions are pressing, and what else in reason could we possibly expect? But let me tell you, that great spirit which first led us to disdain British tyranny, that has enabled us to brave every danger, and surmount the greatest obstacles; that spirit which has conquered whole armies of our enemies, one after another, and humbled the pride of Britain, will easily prevail with us, to part with a little of our money to compleat the glorious work.</P>
<P>INDEED, I by no means think, that we shall find our public charges to be such mighty diffi∣culties as some avaricious and unfriendly minds
<PB N="19" REF="017655_0017_0FA212EB31E8FE28"/>
would feign suggest. Should the infatuation of Britain continue, and it seems likely at present it will, it will help us to money to pay our debts, as it has furnished us with arms to fight our battles. The immense sums Great Britain is constantly sending over to America, to defray the expences of her wicked war, will in the issue, chiefly centre in the Americans pockets. By impoverishing themselves, to gratify their lust of power and revenge, they will in fine greatly en∣rich these States.</P>
<P>A LITTLE exertion, and public spirit, I doubt not, will easily carry us through all our expen∣ces. Lessons of prudence, oeconomy and indus∣try, are naturally inculcated upon us, when mo∣ney is scarce, and taxes are high: and these are profitable lessons for a people at all times.</P>
<P>WE chearfully part with our money when we think we have a good bargain; and certainly there cannot in nature be a better bargain ob∣tained with money, than liberty for our land, and freedom for ourselves and our posterity.</P>
<P>BUT, should Great Britain gain their point, we may absolutely depend upon losing our pos∣sessions and our necks together. For there is not the least scruple in the matter, but the sub∣jugation of these States would be followed with the most shocking scenes of hanging and gib∣betting,
<PB N="20" REF="017655_0018_0FA212EB8DF7E998"/>
from one end of the continent to the other, that was ever known, in any country or age of the world; all promises, covenants, hosta∣ges and acts of parliament to the contrary not∣withstanding.</P>
<P>LET us therefore steadily follow the guidance of providence, and chearfully do our duty, and I doubt not we shall yet see the salvation of God, and our posterity will long rejoice in the happy fruits of our toils and wars.</P>
<P>THE militia of this town merit a particular address at this time.—</P>
<P>TO you, gentlemen, as long as life shall last, this day will be for a memorial. You first felt the shock of the tyrant's arms, and endured the bloody scene. You saw your brethren and friends fall victims to the lawless power and sword of Britain, exerted in a most foolish, wan∣ton and wicked manner. From that hour to the present moment, you have heard the cry of their innocent blood sounding in your ears, and calling aloud for vengeance. Your spirit and ex∣ertion on that day, evidence a martial zeal and ardor in your country's cause: and we trust you will always be ready to defend your country, at the hazard of your lives.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="017655_0019_0FA212EE05B4C8F0"/>
YOU never can want for motives for exerti∣on, as you never can forget the murder of your friends. You and your country will always re∣member with marks of distinguished respect and honour, those persons that first fell sacrifices to our glorious cause: their surviving friends have the pity of their country, and we heartily wish them the consolation of God.</P>
<P>As your names are recorded, and your fame extensive, you will distinguish yourselves, by every exertion and virtue, of patriotism and pub∣lic spirit. It is needless to say any thing to quick∣en your feelings of indignation and abhorrence of British tyranny, or to perpetuate an indignant remembrance of British troops; but must urge you to remember with gratitude to God, his kind appearance for us, in that hour of danger and rage.</P>
<P>As that memorable day, which opened the great scene of the American war, and forever dissolved our union with Britain, has been fol∣lowed with surprising appearances of providence in our favour, so in celebrating this anniversary, it becomes us to bless and praise God for his manifold mercies to our land.</P>
<P>A CHRISTIAN soldier is a noble character indeed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to your martial address, you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to add the ornaments of our
<PB N="22" REF="017655_0020_0FA212EE3A10DA58"/>
holy religion, and take to yourselves the whole armour of God. To a zeal for your country you will add a zeal for God. To a desire to con∣quer your temporal enemies, you will add a de∣sire to conquer satan and sin, and obtain a victory over every sinful lust and passion. And to your struggles for liberty, you will add your unceasing endeavours and prayers, to be made free from sin, and become the servants of God, that your fruit may be unto holiness, and your end ever∣lasting life.</P>
<P>GOD, who has done, and is doing such great things for us, justly expects, that we improve to the glory of his name. His ears have been open to our cries in the hours of our distresses; and his powerful arm has hitherto protected and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us: therefore let our hearts be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and our whole lives but one continued <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of praise unto GOD.</P>
<P>NOR let us cease to pray that God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> di∣rect our counsels; prosper our arms; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> illustrious ally; and always keep our comman∣der in chief under his holy protection; and soon restore and establish an honorable peace, that we may have none to molest us, or make us afraid.</P>
<P>WE still hear the alarm of war in our land, and the calls of our country for our most strenu∣ous
<PB N="23" REF="017655_0021_0FA212F01D1BC458"/>
exertions. We have not as yet put off the harness, nor does <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> become us to boast; but we have constantly new and nobler motives, to ani∣mate and encourage us. Our foreign aid and friendship, we perceive, is daily increasing; and our prospects are enlarging, and brightening in our view. More than this, we have what we no ways deserve, the blessing of Heaven, and the smiles of Providence, in the agreeable and promising opening of the spring. I am sure such things as these, must be animating to the feelings of every ingenuous mind. The path of duty, is our path to safety; and in serving GOD, we in the best manner serve ourselves, our country and posterity. Let us hearken to the united voice of these motives and calls, and present ourselves living sacrifices unto GOD. We have the bles∣sed gospel in our hands, which contains the calls and invitations of our glorious redeemer, and the great promise of eternal life.</P>
<P>IN late years, we have past surprising changes; but we have all, an infinitely greater change to pass, our change by death. We have had strik∣ing scenes, one after another, open to our view; but they are not to be compared to those invisi∣ble scenes that will open upon us in the eternal world.</P>
<P>WE have felt much from the terrors and a∣larms of war; but what are these to the terrors
<PB N="24" REF="017655_0022_0FA212F1B18A6750"/>
of a judgment to come, and to the trump of GOD, that shall one day pierce our ears, and raise the dead. Seeing we look for such things as these, what manner of persons ought we to be, in all holy conversation and godliness.</P>
<P>We have also experienced the joys of victory and triumph over our enemies; pleasing sensa∣tions to mankind in general: but they are mere trifles, to that victory and triumph over sin, death and hell, that shall crown the solemnity of the last day.</P>
<P>To be superior to the fear of our enemies, is indeed a pleasing sensation; but by far a nobler one, to be superior to the fears of death, from a lively faith in him, who has conquered death, and scattered so much light into the gloomy man∣sion of the grave.</P>
<P>WE are all wishing and praying for the bles∣sings of peace, that we may enjoy quiet and rest; but the peace of Heaven, the rest which remains for GOD's people above, is infinitely more deserv∣ing of our labor, wishes and prayers.</P>
<P>LET us then, never forget, that we are candi∣dates for immortal felicity, and shall soon have done with all worldly things, and enter upon the invisible world; and therefore be soberly concerned, to approve ourselves, to our conscien∣ces, to our country, and to our GOD, and then unspeakably great shall be our reward in Heaven.</P>
