</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN it pleased the eternal Son of GOD to tabernacle among us, and come preaching the glad Tidings of Salvation to a fallen World, different Opinions were entertained by differ∣ent Parties concerning him.—As to his Person, some said he was <HI>Moses;</HI> others that he was <HI>Elias, Jeremias,</HI> or one of the ancient Prophets; few acknowledged him to be what he really was, GOD blessed for ever∣more.—And as to his Doctrine, tho' the common People, being free from Prejudice, were persuaded of the heavenly Tendency of his going about to do Good, for the Generality heard him gladly, and said he was a good Man; yet the envious, worldly-minded, self-righteous Governors and Teachers of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church, being grieved at his Success, on the one Hand, and unable (having never been taught of GOD) to understand the Purity of his Doctrine, on the other; notwithstanding our LORD spake as ne∣ver
<PB N="6" REF="004861_0003_100E05F96D5299A0"/>
Man spake, and did such Miracles which no Man could possibly do, unless GOD was with him; yet they not only were so infatuated, as to say, that he deceived the People, but also were so blasphe∣mous as to affirm, that he was in league with the De∣vil himself, and cast out Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils.—Nay, our LORD's own Bre∣thren and Kinsmen, according to the Flesh, were so blinded by Prejudice and Unbelief, that on a certain Day, when he went out to teach the Multitudes in the Fields the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent to take hold on him, urging this as a Reason for their Conduct, <ABBR>viz,</ABBR> <HI>That he was besides himself.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was the King and Lord of Glory judged by Man's Judgment, when made manifest in the Flesh: Far be it from any of his Ministers to expect any better Treatment.—No, if we come in the Spirit and Power of our Master, in this, as in every other Part of his Sufferings, we must follow his Steps.—The like Reproaches which were cast on him, will be thrown on us also.—Those that received our Lord and his Doctrine, will receive and hear us for his Name-sake.—The Poor, blessed be GOD, as our present Meeting abundantly testifies, receive the Gospel, and the common People hear us gladly; whilst those that are sitting in <HI>Moses</HI> his Chair, and love to wear long Robes, being ignorant of the Righ∣teousness which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, and having never felt the Power of GOD upon their Hearts, will be continually crying out against us, as Mad-men, Deceivers of the People, and as acting under the Influences of evil Spirits.</P>
<P>But he is unworthy the Name of a Minister of the Gospel of Peace, who is unwilling, not only to have his Name cast out as evil, but also to die for the Truths of the Lord JESUS.—It is the Character
<PB N="7" REF="004861_0004_100E05FB9B06DE78"/>
of <HI>Hirelings</HI> and <HI>False Prophets,</HI> who care not for the Sheep, to have all Men speak well of them.—<HI>Blessed are you,</HI> says our LORD to his first Apostles, and in them to all succeeding Ministers, <HI>when Men speak all Manner of Evil against you falsely for my Name sake.</HI>—And indeed it is impossible but such Offences must come: For Men will always judge of others according to the Principles from which they act them∣selves.—And if they care not to yield Obedience to the Doctrines which we deliver, they must neces∣sarily, in Self-defence, speak against the Preachers, lest they should be ask'd that Question, which the <HI>Pharisees</HI> of old feared to have retorted on them, if they confes∣sed that <HI>John</HI> was a Prophet, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Why then did you not believe on him?</HI> In all such Cases, we have nothing to do but to search our own Hearts, and if we can as∣sure our Consciences, before GOD, that we act with a single Eye to his Glory, we are chearfully to go on in our Work, and not in the least to regard what Men or Devils can say against, or do unto us.</P>
<P>But to return. You have heard what various Thoughts were handed about concerning JESUS CHRIST whilst here on Earth: Nor is he other∣wise treated, even now he is exalted to sit down at the Right Hand of his Father in Heaven.—A Stran∣ger to Christianity, was he to hear we all profess to hold one LORD, would naturally infer, that we all thought and spoke one and the same Thing about him. But alas! to our Shame be it mentioned, tho' CHRIST be not divided in himself, yet Profossors are sadly divided in their Thoughts about him; and that not only as to the Circumstances of his Religion, but also of those essential Truths which must necessarily be believed and received by us, if ever we hope to be Heirs of eternal Salvation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004861_0005_100E05FD212A8A20"/>
Some, and that I fear a Multitude which no Man can easily number, there are amongst us, who call themselves Christians, and yet seldom or never seri∣ously think of JESUS CHRIST at all. They can think of their Shops, and their Farms, their Plays, their Balls, their Assemblies, and Horse-races, Entertainments, which directly tend to exclude Religion out of the World (but as for CHRIST, the Author and Finisher of Faith, the LORD who has bought poor Sinners with his precious Blood, and who is the only Thing worth their thinking of, alas! he is not in all, at most in very few, of their Thoughts. But believe me, O ye earthly, sensual, carnally minded Professors, how∣ever little you may think of CHRIST now, or how∣ever industriously you may strive to keep him out of your Thoughts, by pursuing the Lust of the Eye, the Lust of the Flesh, and the Pride of Life, yet there is a Time coming, when you will wish you had thought of CHRIST more, and of your Profits and Pleasures less.—For the Gay, the Polite, the Rich also must die as well as others, and leave their Pomps, their Vanities, and all their Wealth behind them.—And oh! what Thoughts will you enter∣tain concerning JESUS CHRIST, in that Hour.</P>
<P>But I must not pursue these Reflections: They would carry me too far from the main Design of this Discourse, which is to shew what those that are truly desirous to know how to worship GOD in Spirit and in Truth, ought to think concerning JESUS CHRIST, whom GOD hath sent to be the End of the Law for Righteousness to all them that shall believe.</P>
<P>I trust, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> you are more noble than to think me too strict or scrupulous, in thus attempting to regulate even your Tho'ts about JESUS CHRIST: For by our Thoughts as well as our Words and Ac∣tions, are we to be judged at the Great Day. And
<PB N="9" REF="004861_0006_100E05FF51A00620"/>
in vain do we hope to believe in, or worship CHRIST aright, unless our Principles on which our Faith and Practice is founded, are agreeable to the Form of sound Words deliver'd to us in the Scriptures of Truth.</P>
<P>Besides, many Deceivers are gone abroad into the World. Mere <HI>Heathen Morality,</HI> and not JESUS CHRIST, is preached in most of our Churches. And how should People think rightly of CHRIST, of whom they have scarcely heard? Do bear with me a little then, whilst, to inform your Consciences, I ask you a few Questions concerning JESUS CHRIST: For there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby we can be saved, but his.</P>
<P>And <HI>First, What think you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Person of</HI> CHRIST? <HI>Whose Son is he?</HI> This is the Question our LORD put to the <HI>Pharisees</HI> in the Words fol∣lowing the Text; and never was it more necessary to repeat this Question than in these last Days. For Numbers that are called after the Name of CHRIST, and I fear, many that pretend to preach him, are so far advanced in the blasphemous Chair, as openly to deny his being really, truly and properly GOD. But no one that ever was Partaker of his Spirit, will speak thus lightly of him. No; if they are asked, as <HI>Peter</HI> and his Brethren were, <HI>but whom say ye that I am?</HI> they will reply without Hesitation, <HI>Thou art</HI> CHRIST <HI>the Son of the everliving GOD.</HI> For the Confession of our Lord's Divinity, is the Rock upon which be builds his Church. Was it possible to take this away, the Gates of Hell would quickly pre∣vail against it.—<HI>My Brethren,</HI> if JESUS CHRIST be not very GOD of very GOD, I would never preach the Gospel again. For it would not be Gos∣pel; it would be only a System of moral Ethicks: <HI>Seneca, Cicero,</HI> or any of the Gentile Philosophers would be as good a Saviour as JESUS of <HI>Nazareth.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="004861_0007_100E06017B488B50"/>
It is the Divinity of our LORD that gives a Sancti∣on on to his Death, and makes him such a High-Priest as became us, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> One who by the infinite Merits of his Suffering could make a full, perfect, sufficient Sacrifice, Satisfaction and Oblation to an infinitely offended Justice. And whatever Minister of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> makes use of her Forms, and eats of her Bread, and yet holds not this Doctrine (as I fear too many such are crept in amongst us) such a one belongs only to the <HI>Synagogue of Satan.</HI>—He is not a Child or Minister of GOD: No; he is a Wolf in Sheep's Cloathing, he is a Child and Minister of that Wicked One the Devil.</P>
<P>Many will think these hard Sayings: But I think it no Breach of Charity to affirm, that an <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> cannot be a Christian.—The one would make us believe JESUS CHRIST <HI>is only a Created God,</HI> which is a Self-Contradiction. And the other would have us look on him only as <HI>a Good Man,</HI> and instead of owning his Death to be an Atonement for the Sins of the World, would persuade us, <HI>that</HI> CHRIST <HI>died only to seal the Truth of his Doctrine with his Blood.</HI> But if JESUS CHRIST be no more than a mere Man, if he be not truly GOD, he was the vilest Sinner that ever appeared in the World.—For he accepted of Divine Adoration from the Man who had been born blind, as we read <HI>John</HI> ix. 38. <HI>And he said, LORD I believe, and worshipped him.</HI> Besides, if CHRIST be not properly GOD, our Faith is vain, we are yet in our Sins:—For no created Being, tho' of the highest Order, could possibly merit any thing at GOD's Hands: No, it was our LORD's Divinity, that alone qualified him to take away the Sins of the World; and therefore we hear St. <HI>John</HI> pronouncing so positively, that <HI>the Word,</HI> i. e. JESUS CHRIST, <HI>was not only with GOD; but was GOD.</HI>—
<PB N="11" REF="004861_0008_100E0603DF0ECE40"/>
For the like Reason, St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, that <HI>he was in the Form of GOD.</HI>—<HI>That in him dwelt all the Fulness of the Godhead bodily.</HI>—Nay, JESUS CHRIST himself assumes the Title which GOD gave to himself, when he sent <HI>Moses</HI> to deliver his People <HI>Israel. Before Abraham, was,</HI> says he, <HI>I am.</HI>—And again, <HI>I and my Father are one.</HI> Which last Words, tho' our modern Infidels would evade and wrest, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own Damnation; yet it is evident, that the <HI>Jews</HI> understood our LORD, when he spake thus, as tho' he made himself equal with GOD; otherwise why did they stone him as a Blasphemer?—And now, why should it be thought a Breach of Charity, to affirm, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that deny the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST, in the strictest Sense of the Word, cannot be Christians? For they are greater Infidels than the Devils themselves.—They confessed that they knew who he was, <HI>even the holy One of GOD.</HI>—They not only believe, but which is more than the Unbelievers of this Generation do, they tremble.—And was it possible for <HI>Arius</HI> or <HI>Soci∣nus,</HI> those Arch-Hereticks, to be released from their Chains of Darkness, under which (unless they altered their Principles before they died) they are now reser∣ved to the Judgment of the great Day, I am persuaded they would inform us, how Hell had convinced them of the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST, and that they would advise their Followers to abhor their Princi∣ples, lest they should come into the same Place, and thereby increase each others Torments.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly, What think you of the Manhood or Incarnation of</HI> JESUS CHRIST? For CHRIST was not only GOD, but he was GOD and Man in one Person. ....Thus runs the Text and Context. ....<HI>When the</HI> Pharisees <HI>were gathered together,</HI> JESUS <HI>asked them, saying, What think ye of</HI> CHRIST? <HI>Whose
<PB N="12" REF="004861_0009_100E06058BBD7670"/>
Son is he?</HI> They say unto him, <HI>the Son of</HI> David.—<HI>How then,</HI> says our Divine Master, <HI>does David in Spirit call him LORD?</HI> From which Passage it is evident, that we do not think rightly of the Person of JESUS CHRIST, unless we believe him to be per∣fect GOD and perfect Man, of a reasonable Soul and human Flesh subsisting.</P>
<P>For it is on this Account that he is called CHRIST, or the <HI>anointed, i. e.</HI> one who through his own vo∣luntary Offer was set apart by the Father, &amp; strength∣ened and qualified by the Anointing or Communica∣tion of the Holy Ghost, to be a Mediator between him and offending Man.</P>
<P>The Reason or first Cause why the Son of GOD took upon him our Nature, was, the Fall of our first Parents.—I hope there is no one present so athe∣istical, as to think that Man made himself: No, it was GOD that made us, and not we ourselves.—And I would willingly think, that no one would be so blasphemous as to suppose, that if GOD did make us, he made us such Creatures as we now find our∣selves to be. For this would be giving GOD's Word the lie, which tells us, that <HI>in the Image of GOD,</HI> not in the Image which we now bear on our Souls, <HI>made he Man.</HI> For as GOD made Man, so GOD made him perfect. He placed him in the Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> and condescended to enter into a Covenant with him, promising him eternal Life, upon Condition of an unsinning Obedience; and threatning eternal Death, if he broke his Law, and eat the forbidden Fruit.</P>
<P>Man did eat; and herein acting as our Repre∣sentative, thereby involved both himself and us in that Curse, which GOD, the righteous Judge, had said should be the Consequence of his Disobedience.—But here begins that Mystery of Godliness, GOD manifested in the Flesh. For (sing, O Heavens, and
<PB N="13" REF="004861_0010_100E0607C355A728"/>
rejoice, O Earth!) the eternal Father, foreseeing how <HI>Satan</HI> would bruise the Heel of Man, had in his eternal Counsel, provided a Means whereby he might bruise that accursed Serpent's Head. Man is permitted to fall, and become subject to Death; but JESUS the only begotten Son of GOD, begotten of the Father before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, offers to die to make an Attonement for his Transgression, and to fulfil all Righteousness in his stead. And because it was im∣possible for him to do this as he was GOD, and yet since Man had offended, it was necessary it should be done in the Person of Man, rather than we should perish; this <HI>Everlasting GOD,</HI> this <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> this <HI>Antient of Days,</HI> in the Fulness of Time, had a Body prepared for him by the Holy Ghost, and be∣came an Infant of a Span long.—In this Body he performed a compleat Obedience to the Law of GOD, whereby he, in our stead, fulfilled the Cove∣nant of Works, and at last became subject to Death, even the Death upon the Cross; that as GOD he might satisfy, as Man he might obey and suffer; and being GOD and Man in one Person, might once more procure a Union between GOD and our Souls.</P>
<P>And now, What think you of this Love of CHRIST? Do not you think it was wondrous great? Especially when you consider that we were CHRIST's bitter Enemies, and that he would have been infinitely happy in himself, notwithstanding we had perished for ever.—Whatever you may think of it, I know the blessed Angels, who are not so much concerned in this Mystery of Godliness as we, think most highly of it.—They do, they will desire to look into and admire it, thro' all Eternity.—Why, Oh why, ye Sinners, will you not think of this Love of CHRIST?—Surely it must melt down the most harden'd
<PB N="14" REF="004861_0011_100E0609ED4A6FC8"/>
Heart.—Whilst I am speaking, the Thoughts of this infinite and condescending Love, fires and warms my Soul.—I could dwell on it forever.—But it is expedient for you, that I should ask you another Question concerning JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, What think you about being justified by</HI> CHRIST?—I believe I can answer for some of you.—For many, I fear, think to be justified or looked upon as righteous in GOD's Sight, without JESUS CHRIST.—But such will find themselves dreadfully mistaken: For <HI>out of</HI> CHRIST <HI>GOD is a consuming Fire.</HI>—Others satisfy themselves with believing that CHRIST was GOD and Man, and that he came into the World to save Sinners in general. Whereas their chief Thoughts ought to be, how they may be assu∣red that JESUS CHRIST came into the World to save them in particular.—<HI>The Life that I now live in the Flesh,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>is by Faith of the Son of GOD, who loved me and gave himself for me.</HI>—Observe, <HI>for me.</HI> For it is this immediate Application of JESUS CHRIST to our own Hearts, that renders his Merits effectual to our eternal Salvation. An unapplied CHRIST will do us no Service at all.—Others there are that go still further: For they think that JESUS CHRIST is GOD-MAN, that he is to be applied to their Hearts, and that they can be justified in GOD's Sight only in or thro' him; but then they make him only in Part a Saviour.—They are for doing what they can themselves, and then JESUS CHRIST is to make up the Deficiencies of their Righteousness. This is the Sum and Substance of of our modern Divinity: And was it possible for me to know the Thoughts of most that hear me this Day, I believe they would tell me, this was the Scheme they had laid, &amp; perhaps depended on for some Years, for their eternal Salvation. Is it not then high Time
<PB N="15" REF="004861_0012_100E060C354E9758"/>
<HI>my Brethren,</HI> for you to entertain quite different Tho'ts concerning Justification by JESUS CHRIST? For if you think thus, you are in the Case of those unhappy <HI>Jews,</HI> who went about establishing their own Righteousness, and would not submit to, and consequently missed of that Righteousness which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS our LORD. What think you then, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> if I tell you, that you are to be justified freely thro' Faith in JESUS CHRIST, without any Regard to any Work, or Fitness, foreseen in us, at all? For Salvation is the free Gift of GOD. I know no Fitness in Man, but a Fitness to be cast into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone forever. Our Righteousnesses in GOD's Sight are but as filthy Rags. He cannot away with them. Our Holiness, if we have any, is not the Cause, but the Effect of our Justification in GOD's Sight.—We love GOD, because he first loved us. We must not come to GOD as the proud <HI>Pharisee</HI> did, bringing in as it were a Reckoning of our Ser∣vices. We must come in the Temper and Language of the poor <HI>Publican,</HI> smiting upon our Breasts and saying, <HI>GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI> For JESUS CHRIST justifies us whilst we are ungodly.—He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repen∣tance. The poor in Spirit, they who are willing to go out of themselves, and rely wholly on the Righteous∣ness of another, are only so blessed as to be Members of his Kingdom. The Righteousness, the whole Righteousness of JESUS CHRIST, is to be imputed to us, instead of our own. For we are not under the Law, but under Grace: And as many as walk after this Rule, Peace be on them; for they, and they only are the true <HI>Israel</HI> of GOD. In the great Work of Man's Redemption, Boasting is intirely excluded; which could not be if only one of our
<PB N="16" REF="004861_0013_100E060E196392A0"/>
Works was to be joined with the Merits of CHRIST. Our Salvation is all of GOD from the Beginning to the End. <HI>It is not of Works, lest any Man should boast.</HI> Man has no hand in it: It is CHRIST who is to be made to us of GOD the Father, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and eternal Redemp∣tion.—His active as well as his passive Obedience, is to be applied to poor Sinners. He has fulfilled all Righteousness in our stead, that we might become the Righteousness of GOD in him.—All we have to do, is to lay hold on this Righteousness by Faith: And that very Moment we do apprehend it by a lively Faith, that very Moment we may be assured that the Blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed us from all Sin.—For the Promise is to us and to our Chil∣dren, and to as many as the LORD our GOD shall call. If we and our whole Houses believe, we shall be saved as well as the Jaylor and his House: For the Righteousness of Jesus Christ is an everlasting as well as a perfect Righteousness.—It is as effectual to all them that believe in him now, as formerly; and so it will be, till Time shall be no more. Search the Scriptures as the <HI>Bereans</HI> did, and see whether these Things are not so. Search St <HI>Paul'</HI>s Epistles to the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Galatians,</HI> and there you will find this Doctrine so plainly taught you, that unless you have Eyes and see not, he that runs may read. Search the Eleventh Article of our Church, <Q>We are ac∣counted righteous before GOD, only for the Merits of our LORD and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deserving.</Q></P>
<P>This Doctrine of our free Justification by Faith in Christ Jesus, however censured and evil spoken of by our present Masters of <HI>Israel,</HI> was highly esteemed by our wise Fore-Fathers: For in the subsequent Words of the fore mentioned Article, it is called <HI>a
<PB N="17" REF="004861_0014_100E0610ED8E9130"/>
most wholesome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort;</HI> and so it is to all that are weary and heavy laden, and are truly willing to find Rest in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>This is Gospel, this is glad Tidings of great Joy to all that feel themselves poor, lost and undone damned Sinners. <HI>Ho every one that thirsteth, come unto the Waters of Life and drink freely; come and buy without Money and without Price.</HI>—Behold a Fountain opened in your Saviour's Side, for Sin and for all Uncleanness. Look unto him whom you have pierced. Look unto him by Faith, and verily you shall be saved, tho' you came here only to ridicule and blaspheme, and never thought of GOD or of Christ before.</P>
<P>Not that you must think GOD will save you be∣cause, or on Account of your Faith: For Faith is a Work, and then you would be justified for your Works. But when I tell you, we are to be justified by Faith, I mean that Faith is the Instrument where∣by the Sinner applies or brings home the Redemp∣tion of Jesus Christ to his Heart. And to whom∣soever GOD gives such a Faith (for it is the free Gift of GOD) he may lift up his Head with Bold∣ness, he need not fear, he is a spiritual Son of our spiritual <HI>David,</HI> he has passed from Death to Life, he shall never come into Condemnation.—This is the Gospel which we preach. If any Man or Angel preach any other Gospel, than this of our being free∣ly justified thro' Faith in Christ Jesus, we have the Authority of the greatest Apostle to pronounce him accursed.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> What think you of this Foolishness of Preaching? To you that have tasted the good Word of Life, and been enlightned to see the Riches of GOD's free Grace in Christ Jesus, I am persuaded it is precious, and has distilled
<PB N="18" REF="004861_0015_100E061273BBCE10"/>
like the Dew into your Souls.—And Oh! that all were like minded!—But I am afraid Numbers are ready to go away contradicting and blaspheming. Tell me, are there not many of you saying within your∣selves, <Q>This is a licentious Doctrine; this Preacher is opening a Door for Encouragement in Sin.</Q> But this does not surprize me at all; it is a stale antiquated Objection, as old as the Doctrine of Justification it∣self; and (which by the Way is not much to the Credit of those who urge it now) it was made by an Infidel. St. <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> after he had in the first five Chapters demonstrably proved the Doctrine of Justification by Faith alone; in the sixth, brings in an Unbeliever saying, <HI>shall we conti∣nue in Sin then that Grace may abound?</HI> But as he rejected such an Inference with a <HI>God forbid,</HI> so do I: For the Faith which we preach is not a dead speculative Faith, <HI>an assenting to Things credible as credible,</HI> as it is commonly defined. It is not a Faith of the Head only: but a Faith of the Heart. It is a living Principle wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of the Ever-living GOD, whereby the Sinner being convinced of his lost and undone Con∣dition by Nature, is enabled to apply or lay hold on the perfect Righteousness of JESUS CHRIST freely offered in the Gospel, and whereby out of a Principle of Love and Gratitude, he is afterwards continually excited to abound in every good Word and Work. This is the Sum and Substance of the Doctrine that has been delivered.—And if this be a licentious Doctrine judge ye.—No, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> this is not destroying, but teaching you how to do good Works, from a proper Principle.—For to use the Words of our Church in another of her Articles, <Q>Works done before the Grace of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Inspiration of the Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they
<PB N="19" REF="004861_0016_100E0613FB6EF358"/>
spring not of Faith in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>—rather for that they are not done as God has willed and command∣ed them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</Q> So that they who bid you do, and then live, are just as wise as those who would per∣suade you to build a beautiful magnificent House, without laying a Foundation.</P>
<P>It's true, the Doctrine of our free Justification by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, like other Gospel Truths, may and will be abused by Men of corrupt Minds, Reprobates concerning the Faith: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y who receive the Truth of GOD in the Love of it, will al∣ways be shewing their Faith by their Works. For this Reason, St. <HI>Paul</HI> after he had been telling the <HI>Ephe∣sians, That by Grace they were saved thro' Faith, not of Works, lest any Man should boast,</HI> immediately adds, <HI>For we are his Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus nnto good Works.</HI> And in his Epistle to <HI>Titus,</HI> having given him Directions, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>Ver.</HI> 7. to tell Peo∣ple they were justified by Grace, directly subjoins, <HI>Ver.</HI> 8. <HI>I will that you affirm constanly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good Works.</HI> Agreeable to this we are told in our 12th Article, <Q>That albeit good Works, which are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification, can∣not put away our Sins, and endure the Severity of God's Judgment; yet are they pleasing and accep∣table to God in Christ; and do spring necessarily out of a true and lively Faith, insomuch that a lively Faith may be as evidently known by them as a Tree discerned by the Fruit.</Q></P>
<P>Oh what would I give, that this Article was duly understood and preached by all that have subscribed to it! The Ark of the Lord would not then be driven into the Wilderness, nor so many dissent from the <HI>Church of England.</HI>—For I am fully persuaded, that
<PB N="20" REF="004861_0017_100E06170F62F700"/>
it's not so much on account of Rites and Ceremonies, as our not Preaching the Truth as it is in JESUS, that so many have been obliged to go and seek for Food elsewhere. Did not we fall from our establish∣ed Doctrines, few, comparatively speaking, would fall from the establish'd Church. Where <HI>Christ</HI> is preached, tho' it be in a Church or Common, Dissen∣ters of all Denominations have and do most freely come. But if our Clergy will preach only the Law, and not shew the Way of Salvation by Faith in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> the Charge of Schism at the Day of Judgment, I fear, will chiefly lie at their Door. The true Sheep of <HI>Christ</HI> know the Voice of <HI>Christ'</HI>s true Shepherds, <HI>Strangers they will not hear.</HI></P>
<P>Observe, <HI>my dear Brethren,</HI> the Words of the Ar∣ticle, <HI>good Works are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification.</HI></P>
<P>How then can they precede or be any ways the Cause of it? No; our Persons must be justified be∣fore our Performances can be accepted. God had respect to <HI>Abel</HI> before he had respect to his Offering: And therefore the Righteousness of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> must be freely imputed to, and apprehended by us thro' Faith, before we can offer an acceptable Sa∣crifice to God: For out of <HI>Christ,</HI> as I hinted before, God is a consuming Fire; and whatsoever is not of Faith in Christ, is Sin.</P>
<P>People's mistaking the Doctrine of free Justifica∣tion, I believe, is partly owing to their not rightly considering the different Persons St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>James</HI> wrote to in their Epistles, as also the different Kind of Justification each of them writes about: The former asserts in Line upon Line, Argument upon Argument, <HI>that we are justified by Faith alone.</HI>—The latter puts this Question, <HI>Was not</HI> Abraham <HI>justified by Works?</HI> From whence many, not consi∣dering
<PB N="21" REF="004861_0018_100E061895193EC0"/>
the different Views of these Holy Men, and the different Persons they wrote to, have blended and joined Faith and Works in order to justifie us in the Sight of God. But this is a Mistake all over: For St. <HI>Paul</HI> was writing to the Jewish Proselites, who sought Righteousness by the Works, not of the Ceremonial only, but of the Moral Law.—In Con∣tradistinction to that, he tells them they were to look for Justification in God's Sight, only by the perfect Righteousness of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> apprehended by Faith.—St. <HI>James</HI> had a different Set of People to deal with, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> such who abused the Doctrines of free Justification, and thought they should be saved (as Numbers among us do now) upon their barely pro∣fessing to believe on <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI>—These the holy Apostle endeavours wisely to convince, that such a Faith was only a dead and false Faith, and therefore it behoved all who would be blessed with faithful <HI>Abraham,</HI> to shew forth their Faith by their Works as he did:—<HI>For was not</HI> Abraham <HI>justified by Works,</HI> says he? <HI>i. e.</HI> Did he not prove that his Faith was a true justifying Faith by its being productive of good Works? From whence it is plain that St. <HI>James</HI> is talking of a declarative Justification before Men: <HI>Shew me,</HI> demonstrate, evidence to me, that thou hast a true Faith, by thy Works. Whereas St. <HI>Paul</HI> is talking only of our being justified in the Sight of God; and thus he proves that <HI>Abraham,</HI> as we also are to be, was justified before ever the Moral or Ceremonial Law was given to the Jews: For it is written, <HI>Abraham believed in the Lord, and it was ac∣counted to him for Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Take the Substance of what has been said on this Head, in the few following Words.—Every Man that is saved, is justified three Ways. <HI>First,</HI> meri∣toriously, <HI>i. e.</HI> by the Death of <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> It is
<PB N="22" REF="004861_0019_100E061AC1B9D560"/>
the Blood of <HI>Jesus Christ alone that cleanses us from all Sin. Secondly,</HI> instrumentally, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> By Faith; Faith is the Means or Instrument whereby the Merits of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> are applied to the Sinner's Heart: <HI>Ye are all the Children of God by Faith in</HI> Christ Jesus. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> we are justified declaratively; namely, by good Works, <HI>i. e.</HI> good Works declare and prove to the World, that our Faith is a true saving Faith.—<HI>Was not</HI> Abraham <HI>justified by Works?</HI> and Again, <HI>Shew me thy Faith by thy Works?</HI>—</P>
<P>It may not be improper to illustrate this Doctrine by an Example or two. I suppose no one will pre∣tend to say, that there was any Fitness for Salvation in <HI>Zacheus</HI> the Publican, when he came to see <HI>Jesus</HI> out of no better Principle, than that whereby perhaps Thousands are led to hear me preach, I mean Curi∣osity; but <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> prevented and called him by his free Grace, and sweetly, but irresistibly inclined him to obey that Call, as I pray God he may influ∣ence all you that come only to see who the Preacher is. <HI>Zacheus</HI> received our Lord joyfully into his House, and at the same Time by Faith receiv'd him into his Heart. <HI>Zacheus</HI> was then freely justified in the Sight of God.—But behold the immediate Fruits of that Justification! He stands forth in the Midst, and as before he had believed in his Heart, he now makes Confession with his Mouth to Salvation.—<HI>Behold, Lord, the Half of my Goods I give unto the Poor, and if I have taken any Thing from any Man by false Accusation, I restore him Four-fold.</HI>—And thus it will be with thee, O Believer, as soon as ever God's dear Son is revealed in thee by a living Faith, thou wilt have no Rest in thy Spirit, till out of Love and Gra∣titude for what God has done for thy Soul, thou she west forth thy Faith by thy Works.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004861_0020_100E061C4AB09280"/>
Again, I suppose every Body will grant there was no Fitness for Salvation in the Persecutor <HI>Saul,</HI> no more than there is in those persecuting Zealots of these last Days, who are already breathing out Threat∣nings, and, if in their Power, would breath out Slaugh∣ter also, against the Disciples of the LORD.</P>
<P>Now our Lord, we know, freely prevented him by his Grace (and, O that he would thus effectually call the Persecutors of this Generation) and by a Light from Heaven struck him to the Ground.—At the same Time, by his Spirit, he pricked him to the Heart, convinced him of Sin, and caused him to cry out, <HI>Who art thou, Lord?</HI> Christ replies, <HI>I am</HI> JESUS <HI>whom thou persecute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Faith then was in∣stantaneously given him, and behold, immediately <HI>Saul</HI> cries out, <HI>Lord what wouldst thou have me to do?</HI> And so will every poor Soul that believes on the Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> with his whole Heart. He will be al∣ways asking, <HI>Lord what shall I do for thee? Lord what wouldst thou have me to do?</HI> Not to justify him∣self, but only to evidence the Sincerity of his Love and Thankfulness to his all-merciful High-Priest, for plucking him as a Firebrand out of the Fire.</P>
<P>Perhaps, many Self-righteous Persons amongst you, may flatter yourselves, that you are not so wicked as either <HI>Zacheus</HI> or <HI>Saul</HI> was, and consequently there is a greater Fitness for Salvation in you than in them. But if you think thus, indeed you think more highly of yourselves than you ought to think: For by Na∣ture we are all alike, all equally fallen short of the Glory of God, all equally dead in Trespasses and Sins, and there needs the same Almighty Power to be exerted in converting any one of the most sober, good natured Moral Persons here present, as there was in converting the Publican <HI>Zacheus,</HI> or that no∣torious Persecutor <HI>Saul.</HI>—And was it possible for you
<PB N="24" REF="004861_0021_100E061EC6F714C0"/>
to ascend into the highest Heavens, and to enquire of the Spirits of just Men made perfect, I am persuad∣ed they would tell you this Doctrine is from God. But we have a more sure Word of Prophecy, to which we would do well to give heed, as unto a Light shining in a dark Place. <HI>My Brethren,</HI> the Word is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh you; search the Scripture; beg of God to make you willing to be saved in this the Day of his Power. For it is not Flesh and Blood, but the Spirit of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> that alone can reveal these Things unto you.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> and lastly, <HI>What think you of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>being formed within you?</HI> For whom <HI>Christ</HI> justifies, them he also sanctifies. Altho' he finds, yet he does not leave us unholy.—A true Christian may not so properly be said to live, as JESUS CHRIST to live in him. For they only that are led by the Spirit of CHRIST, who is GOD, are the true Sons of GOD.</P>
<P>As I observed before, so I tell you again, the Faith which we preach is not a dead, but a lively active Faith wrought in the Soul and working a thorough Change, by the Power of the Holy Ghost, in the whole Man—And unless CHRIST be thus in you, not∣withstanding you may be orthodox as to the forego∣ing Principles, notwithstanding you may have good Desires, and attend constantly on the Means of Grace; yet, in St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Opinion, you are out of a State of Salvation. <HI>Know you not,</HI> says that Apostle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> a Church famous for its Gifts above any Church under Heaven, <HI>that</HI> CHRIST <HI>is in you,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by his Spirit, <HI>unless you are Reprobates?</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Christ</HI> came not only to save us from the Guilt, but the Power of our Sins: Till he has done this, however he may be a Saviour to others, we can have no Assurance, or well-grounded Hope, that he has saved us: For it is by receiving his blessed Spirit into our Hearts, and feeling him witnessing with
<PB N="25" REF="004861_0022_100E06219D5844A0"/>
our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God, that we can be certified of our being sealed to the Day of Redemption.</P>
<P>This is a great Mystery, but I speak of <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>New Birth.</HI>—Marvel not at my asking you, what you think about <HI>Christ</HI> being formed within you? For either GOD must change his Nature, or we ours. For as in <HI>Adam</HI> we all have spiritually died, so all that are effectually saved by <HI>Christ,</HI> must in <HI>Christ</HI> be spiritually made alive. His only End in dying and rising again, and interceding for us now in Heaven, is to redeem us from the Misery of our fal∣len Nature, and, by the Operation of his blessed Spirit, to make us meet to be Partakers of the Heaven∣ly Inheritance with the Saints in Light. None but those that thus are changed by his Grace here, shall appear with him in Glory hereafter.</P>
<P>Examine yourselves therefore, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> whe∣ther you are in the Faith; prove yourselves; &amp; think it not sufficient to say in your Creed, <HI>I believe in Je∣sus Christ:</HI> For you do not believe, you are Liars, you are Reprobates, you are yet in a State of Death. You take God's Name in vain when you call him Father. Your Prayers are turned into Sin, unless you believe into <HI>Christ,</HI> so as to have your Life hid with him in God, and to receive Life and Nourishment from Him, as the Branches do from the Vine.</P>
<P>I know, indeed, the Men of this Generation deny there is any such Thing as Feeling CHRIST within them; but alas! to what a dreadful Condition would such reduce us, even to the State of the abandoned Heathens, who St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us were <HI>past Feeling.</HI>—The <HI>Apostle</HI> prays that the <HI>Ephesians</HI> may abound in all Knowledge &amp; <HI>Spiritual Understanding,</HI> or as it might be rendered, <HI>Spiritual Sensation.</HI>—And in the Office for the Visitation of the Sick, the Minister prays, that
<PB N="26" REF="004861_0023_100E062322EDD560"/>
the Lord may make the sick Person know and <HI>feel,</HI> that there is no other <HI>Name</HI> under Heaven given unto Men, in whom and thro' whom they may receive Health and Salvation, but only the Name of our Lord JESUS.—For there is a spiritual, as well as a corporeal Feeling, and tho' this is not communicated to us in a sensible Manner, as outward Objects affect our out∣ward Senses, yet it is as real, as any sensible or visible Sensation, and may be as truly felt and discerned by the Soul, as any Impression from without can be felt by the Body.—All that are born again of God, know that I lie not.</P>
<P>What think you, Sirs, did <HI>Naaman</HI> feel when he was cured of his Leprosy? Did the Woman feel Virtue coming out of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> when she touch∣ed the Hem of his Garment, and was cured of her bloody Issue? So surely mayest thou feel, O Believer, when <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> dwelleth in thy Heart. I pray God make you all know and feel this, e'er you de∣part hence.</P>
<P>Oh, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> my Heart is enlarged towards you. I trust I feel something of that hidden, but powerful Presence of CHRIST, whilst I am preaching to you. Indeed it is sweet, indeed it is exceeding comfortable. All the Harm I wish you, that with∣out Cause are my Enemies, is, that you felt the like. Believe me, tho' it would be Hell to my Soul, to return to a natural State again, yet I would wil∣lingly change States with you for a little while, that you might know what it is to have <HI>Christ</HI> dwelling in your Hearts by Faith. Oh! Do not turn your Backs. Do not let the Devil hurry you away. Be not afraid of Convictions. Do not think worse of the Doctrine, because preached without the Church Walls.—Our Lord in the Days of his Flesh, preach∣ed on a Mount, a Ship, a Field; and I am persuad∣ed
<PB N="27" REF="004861_0024_100E0624A873ED30"/>
many have felt his gracious Presence here.—In∣deed we speak what we know.—Oh do not reject the Kingdom of God against yourselves. Be so wise as to receive our Witness.—I cannot, I will not let you go. Stay a little, let us reason together.—However lightly you may esteem your Souls, I know our Lord has set an unspeakable Value on them. He thought them worthy of his most precious Blood.—I beseech you therefore, O Sinners, be ye reconciled to God. I hope you do not fear being accepted in the Beloved.—Behold he calleth you. Behold he pre∣vents and follows you with his Mercy, and hath sent forth his Servants into the High-ways and Hed∣ges, to compel you to come in. Remember then, that at such an Hour, of such a Day, in such a Year, in this Place, you were all told what you ought to think concerning <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI>—If you now perish, it will not be for lack of Knowledge.—I am free from the Blood of you all.—You cannot say I have been preaching Damnation to you.—You can∣not say I have, like legal Preachers, been requiring you to make Brick without Straw. I have not bid you make yourselves Saints, and then come to God.—But I have offer'd you Salvation on as cheap Terms as you can desire.—I have offered you <HI>Christ'</HI>s whole Wisdom, <HI>Christ'</HI>s whole Righteousness, <HI>Christ'</HI>s whole Sanctification and Eternal Redemption, if you will but believe on him.—If you say you cannot believe, you say right; for Faith as well as every other Bles∣sing is the Gift of God: But then wait upon God and who knows but he may have Mercy on thee. Why do we not entertain more loving Thoughts of CHRIST? Or do you think he will have Mercy on o∣thers, and not on you? But are you not Sinners? And did not JESUS CHRIST come into the World to save Sinners?—If you say you are the chief of Sinners; I
<PB N="28" REF="004861_0025_100E0626DB828AA0"/>
answer, that will be no Hindrance to your Salvation, indeed it will not, if you lay hold on him by Faith. Read the Evangelists, and see how kindly he behaved to his Disciples who fled from and denied him. <HI>Go tell my Brethren,</HI> says he.—He does not say, Go tell those Traitors; but, Go tell my <HI>Brethren; And Peter;</HI> as tho' he had said, <Q>go tell my Brethren in general, and poor <HI>Peter</HI> in particular, <HI>that I am risen.</HI> Oh, comfort his poor drooping Heart, tell him I am reconciled to him. Bid him weep no more so bitterly. For though with Oaths and Curses he has thrice deny'd me, yet I have died for his Sins, I am risen again for his Justifi∣cation, I freely forgive him all.</Q>—Thus slow to Anger, and of great Kindness, was our all-merciful High-Priest. And do you think he has changed his Nature, and forgets poor Sinners now he is exalted to the Right-Hand of God? No, he is the same Ye∣sterday, to Day and forever, and sitteth there only to make Intercession for us. ..... Come then, ye Har∣lots, come ye Publicans, come ye most abandoned Sinners, come and believe on <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Tho' the whole World despise you and cast you out, yet he will not disdain to take you up. Oh! amazing, Oh! infinitely condescending Love, even you he will not be ashamed to call his Brethren. And Oh! how will you escape if you neglect such a glorious Offer of Salvation? What would the damned Spirits now in the Prison of Hell give, if <HI>Christ</HI> was so freely offered to their Souls? And why are not we lifting up our Eyes in Torment? Does any one out this great Multitude dare say, he does not deserve Damnation? If not, why are we left and others taken away by Death? What is this but an Instance of God's free Grace, and a Sign of his good Will towards us? Oh then, let God's Goodness lead us to Repentance!
<PB N="29" REF="004861_0026_100E06290C8F4560"/>
Oh let there be Joy in Heaven over some of you repenting! Tho' we are in a Field, I am persuaded the blessed Angels are hovering now around us, and long, <HI>as the Hart panteth after the Water Brooks,</HI> to sing an Anthem at your Conversion. Blessed be God I hope their Joy will be fulfilled. An awful Silence appears amongst us. I have good Hope that the Words that the Lord has enabled me to speak in your Ears this Day, have not altogether fallen to the Ground. Your Tears and deep Attention are an Evidence, that the Lord God is amongst us of a Truth. Come ye <HI>Pharisees,</HI> come and see, in spight of your Satanical Rage and Fury, the Lord JESUS is getting himself the Victory. And Brethren, I speak the Truth in CHRIST, I lie not, if one Soul of you, by the Blessing of God, be brought to think savingly of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> this Day, I care not if my Enemies were permitted to carry me to Prison and put my Feet fast in the Stocks, as soon as I have deliver'd this Sermon. Brethren, my Heart's Desire and Prayer to God is, that you may be saved. For this Cause I follow my Master without the Camp. I care not how much of his sacred Reproach I bear, so that some of you be converted from the Error of your Ways. I rejoice, yea and I will rejoice. Ye Men, ye Devils do your worst. The LORD who sent will support me. And when CHRIST, who is our Life, and whom I have now been preaching, shall appear, I also, together with his despised little Ones, shall appear with him in Glory.—And then, what will you think of CHRIST?—I know what you will think of him. You will then think him to be <HI>the Fairest among ten Thousand.</HI> You will then think and <HI>feel</HI> him to be a just and Sin-avenging Judge. Oh then be ye persuaded to kiss him lest he be angry, and so you be banished forever from the Presence of the Lord. Behold I
<PB N="30" REF="004861_0027_100E062B348F1BD0"/>
come to you, as the Angel did to <HI>Lot.</HI> My dear <HI>Brethren,</HI> flee, flee for your Lives, haste, linger no longer in your spiritual <HI>Sodom;</HI> for otherwise you will be eternally destroyed. Numbers, no Doubt, there are amongst you, that may regard me no more than <HI>Lot'</HI>s Sons-in-law regarded him. I am persuaded I seem to some of you as one that mocks.—But I speak the Truth in CHRIST, I lie not, as sure as Fire and Brimstone rained from the Lord out of Heaven, to destroy <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> so surely at the great Day shall the Vials of God's Wrath be pour∣ed on you, if you do not think seriously of and act a∣greeable to the Gospel of the Lord's CHRIST. Be∣hold I have told you before,—I pray GOD, all you that forget him may seriously think of what has been said, before he pluck you away and there be none to deliver you.</P>
