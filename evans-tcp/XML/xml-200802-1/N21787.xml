<BIBL>PSALM xlv. 16.</BIBL>
<Q>INSTEAD OF THY FATHERS SHALL BE THY CHILDREN, WHOM THOU MAYEST MAKE PRINCES IN ALL THE EARTH.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS psalm is an illustration of many other prophe∣cies which relate to the Messiah, the Prince, and points him out more expressly than any other chapter or psalm in the Old Testament. It speaks of the royalty and ex∣cellency of his person; the extensiveness of his victories; the righteousness of his government, of which there would be no end: for his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion ruleth over all.</P>
<P>And, that though in this world his subjects would be continually moving off the stage, increasing the number of the dead; yet, that they would be succeeded by rising generations, who should come in their room; who, by making greater improvements in knowledge and virtue, under better advantages for light, truth and grace, may rise to honour in the present, and arrive to the dignity of kings, and the sanctity of priests, in the future world; so, in the sense of our text, be made princes in all the earth. So, we may consider our text as a prophecy, containing a promise which ascertains the increasing glory of the king∣dom of the Redeemer among men; for it implies, that, by improving clearer light and richer privileges of grace, and the blessings of the gospel, the succeeding generations of men may arive to greater purity of morals, and dignity of character, and be made princes in all the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028687_0004_0FDA526F8C85AC58"/>
Our text also implies, that there will be a succession of men, who shall restore the wastes of mortality; that the earth shall not want inhabitants: but the various depar∣tments, both in civil and social life, shall be filled with hon∣our and fidelity; and not only so, but that there shall be a succession of good men; for both the prophecy and pro∣mise of our text respect the future happy reign of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> when he shall have, as the reward of his sufferings, a seed to serve him, who shall be accounted unto the Lord for a generation of the righteous; and opens to the eye of faith, an extensive spread of religion to unborn nations; when the sublime maxims of piety and morality shall be generally received, and operate as universal principles of true virtue, which shall raise the dignity of human nature; that, in however high or low offices they may be called to act, they will fill their stations with honour; that, in the language of our text, they may be princes in all the earth; that it may be said of all the earth, as it was of Tyre, "Her merchants shall be princes and her traffickers or me∣chanicks shall be the honourable of the earth, <HI>Isaiah</HI> xxiii. 8.</P>
<P>When we reflect upon the time, the manner and the views, with which our pious ancestors left the land of their nativity, and sought a retreat from the iron hand of tyran∣ny and oppression in these wilds of America, which, from time immemorial, had been overspread with moral dark∣ness, heathen barbarity, and Indian idolatry; and as they brought the gospel and the means of knowledge with them, and were influenced by its sacred maxims, the knowledge of God and Jesus Christ was soon spread—the worship of God established—schools were erected—semi∣naries planted—colleges founded by them; but as they were not allowed to "continue by reason of death," in the room of these pious fathers were their children, who pious∣ly maintained these institutions: being nursed in those seminar<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> they became "plants of renown," who being transplanted into the church and state, where they shone with honor; some in the higher and more public offices of life; and others, being instructed in the lower and more common branches of literature, have been bred to agricul∣ture
<PB N="5" REF="028687_0005_0FDA527370ED11F8"/>
navigation, and the mechanical arts, and moving in a humbler yet not less useful sphere; but whenever either the higher or the lower departments have been uniformly influenced, directed and restrained by the nobler principles of true virtue, they have appeared princely in all the earth: so that at the distance of more than two thousand years from the publication of this prophecy and promise, we have seen them fulfilling, down to the present day; so that we are living witnesses of their truth and importance; for we are in the room of our fathers, and here we see our children forming, and by the various grades of education rising into respectability, and will soon take our places, and we must leave them our room, and descend to the bed of dust—"when our sons may rise to honour, and we shall know it not; or they may be brought low, and we shall not perceive it of them." But if we are not wanting to ourselves, to our children, or to society, we may hope that this scripture will be more completely fulfilled, and the kingdom of the Redeemer will soon have a more extensive spread than it ever yet has had; and that in the room of the fathers there will be children, who may successively arise and declare his righteousness unto those who may be born of them.</P>
<P>But prophecies and promises do not prevent or supersede human endeavours; but they are designed to encourage duty, to stimulate noble exertions, and support and brighten future hopes. Therefore, animated by the pro∣phecy and promise, that God will have a seed to serve him, and that in the room of the fathers shall be the children, who, by the improvement of clearer light and more distin∣guished priveleges, may appear in their several stations to advantage, <HI>princes in all the earth,</HI> let us do what we can to promote the education of our children. Particular at∣tention should be paid to youth, the rising generation, that they be well instructed, religiously educated, and stea∣dily and wisely governed. The education of children was always the first thing our pious forefathers attended to; after they had got a settlement in this land, they, like Abram, first built an altar, fixed on a place for public
<PB N="6" REF="028687_0006_0FDA5276434C7B80"/>
worship, and then erected schools for the education of their children.</P>
<P>So long ago as in 1633, the first settlers of this town consecrated a house for public worship, and soon after made provision for a school, as being in their view of importance to society, next to that of worshipping God in a public and social manner, placing the duty we owe to our chil∣dren next to that we owe to our God: therefore, when new townships were laid out or incorporated, care was taken that lands were sequestrated first for the encouragement and benefit of the gospel ministry, and then school lots for the benefit and support of free schools:—so also particular care was taken that all instructors of schools were men of capacity, piety, and good morals. Thus it is evident that the idea that our forefathers had of a school education, was that it should be <HI>religious.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed without the heart is well established on the principles of religion, the most enlightened head will be of little use to society, and of less advantage to the persons themselves; they will not be princes in the earth, will not fill the stations they are called to occupy with honour;—men of learning, without the balance of virtuous principles, will be likely to prove pests to society, and accumulate to themselves infamy and ruin. Suffer me then, on this oc∣casion, to recommend it to all whose business it is, or may be, to provide instructors and governors of schools, that they employ none but those who are equal to the trust, and of sober lives and conversation; men of principle, and who in the judgment of charity are good men. And I would recommend to all masters and instructors of schools, that they pay particular attention to the morals of the schools, over which they preside; that they inform the understand∣ing and impress the heart; for though without know∣ledge the heart cannot be good, yet the most extensive knowledge, without the regulating principles of religion, will not make the heart better, nor reform the life. It is of the last importance then, that a religious cast should be given to all school education; and this importance a∣rises out of the nature and reason of things, and it is sug∣gested
<PB N="7" REF="028687_0007_0FD9BBD4A8CC6988"/>
to us from the words of our text; for the children are to come in the room of their fathers, and to act a no∣ble part—<HI>princes in all the earth;</HI> adopt a line of conduct in whatever department they shall be called to act in, that may be an honour to themselves, support the dignity of the human character, be, and appear to be, the sons of God, the disciples of Jesus Christ, and friends to all man∣kind; and so, in the sense of our text, be made princes in all the earth.</P>
<P>Give me leave to add—it is of importance that youth be religiously instructed; for it is through them that reli∣gion and good morals are to be transmitted to posterity: they are our hopes, and we expect to live in them. Now to support these pleasing hopes, it is necessary that they should come upon the stage with their minds well informed in all the various branches of useful knowledge, and their hearts well established by the operation of the principles of true virtue.</P>
<P>We all love to have our children wise and good. Those who are vicious themselves, love to have their children ap∣pear in the world under every advantage, and to act an ho∣nourable part in the sphere where Providence shall place them, and ever approve themselves wise, virtuous and good; good members of the society to which they may belong.</P>
<P>And I do not think that any one of us can relish the thought with pleasure, that religion, good order and liber∣ty, both civil and religious, shall die in the hands of our children; that the cause for which our ancestors left their native country, and for which our late fathers and breth∣ren have fought, bled and died, should be lost in the hands of the next generation: and without they are well instruct∣ed, well governed, their heads well furnished with useful knowledge, and their hearts under the regulating princi∣ples of piety and morality, we shall have no security of the cause in their hands. No one can well conceive how much, under God, depends upon the character of our children, both with respect to themselves and to society at large: and we can scarcely realize the refined pleasure it
<PB N="8" REF="028687_0008_0FDA527C2B47B640"/>
must afford a tender and well disposed parent, when they can look forward, and on good grounds hope, that their children will rise up and take their places and fill them with honour, and, in the style of our text, be made princes in all the earth. With such a prospect the parental heart leaps for joy, for they have no "greater joy than that of seeing their children walk in the truth." When they see them formed to this amiable temper, to this honourable and useful character, they can leave the world in peace; or like that pious father of old, who called his children round about his dying pillow, and said, behold I die; but God shall be with you, and make you princes in all the earth, ornaments to society, an honour to themselves, and the glory of future generations.</P>
<P>I think we may, in the faithful discharge of the duties incumbent upon us to the present generation, safely con∣fide in the prophecy and promise of God, that in our room shall be our children, who, by a better improvement of the privileges and advantages they do, or they may enjoy, in this day of science and land of liberty, may, under the transforming hand of knowledge and grace, be made, in the sense of our text, princes in all the earth.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You have done well in the attention you have paid to, and the provision you have made for, the education of your children; and, agreeable to the votes of the respective bodies you represent, have erected houses so respectable
<PB N="9" REF="028687_0009_0FDA527F356D0850"/>
and convenient, for that purpose: and I will assure you, that it gives me pleasure to find that you have connected the idea of religion with the purposes for which you built those houses, therefore invited me to assist you in dedicat∣ing them to God. It was at the desire of the trustees of the Proprietors' School, that we opened their house with a dedicatory prayer and a short address to the school.</P>
<P>We have this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fifth of March, 1795, and the order of procession was as follows:—The Schools begun the procession from the Meeting House—first the Proprietors' School walked in classical order two and two, and their preceptor, Mr. Thomas Saunders, brought up their rear; next to him the Town Grammar School, in the same order; these were followed by their preceptor, Mr. Obadiah Parsons; who was follow∣ed by the gentlemen of the town—then the Trustees of the Proprie∣tors' School—the Committee of Inspection next—after them the Se∣lectmen; last of all the Clergy of the town. In this order the whole body moved on to the newly erected School House, which was now finished, ready to be improved. When the front of the Proprietors' School reached the door, the whole stopped, and, opening to the right and left, the Clergy moved on through the ranks, followed by the Selectmen, and so on, till the whole were placed in the most decent order in the School House—then a dedicatory prayer was addressed to the Father of Lights—then all returned in the same order to the House of God, where each one occupied the seat assigned him by mutual and previous agreement, exhibiting one of the most pleasing scenes the mind of man can well imagine, and a very striking contrast with that dismal day, the 5th of March, 1770, when Boston streets reeked with the blood and carnage of our fellow citizens, when every heart was pain∣ed, and every face gathered blackness—now every heart was elate with joy, and every countenance teemed with hope.</NOTE> met, and in solemn procession went to the Town Grammar School House, newly erected for the beneficent design of the religious education of our children, and in a solemn and religious manner consecra∣ted it to God, imploring the divine acceptance of it, invi∣ting the divine presence into it, and humbly asked the di∣vine blessing upon it; that it may become a seminary of virtue as well as of the most useful learning; that plants of renown may be transplanted from hence, both into the Church and State, and be a seed who may serve the Lord, and continue to bring forth fruit even to old age, and be accounted unto the Lord for the generation of the righte∣ous.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen and Christian Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Let us go on, that we may be workers together with God in forming a people for his praise. Let us all unite, and do what we can, to encourage, support and inspect the education of the rising generation.</P>
<P>We see of what importance it is to them; how essen∣tial to the good of society: on this, under God, rests the peace, the honour, and the prosperity, of these United States of America; <HI>without it,</HI> in the very next generation, the cause of truth, the rights of men, civil and religious liber∣ty, can neither be defined or defended, when anarchy with fell discord on one hand, despotism, with vice and su∣perstition on the other, will, like an overwhelming scourge deluge this whole land. What, then, our hands find to do, let us do it with all diligence; for our text suggests that we are moving off—these our children are coming in our room; in the room of the fathers shall be the children—we must soon give place to them—And what part would we have them act in our places when we are gone?—When we look abroad, and see how many chil∣dren are neglected by their parents, and left the sport of native corruptions, exposed to every snare the enemy of man and the contagion of evil examples are daily spread∣ing before them; when we consider how many, especially among the lower class, who are growing up in ignorance, early learn to profane the name of God, to waste in idle∣ness and sloth the sacred day of rest, and to consume their learning age in vain amusements and idle dissipation, our hearts may well tremble for the ark of God, and we feel a solicitude for the cause that those who are coming into our room must support. While we confide in the divine pro∣mise, let us extend the arm of benevolence, and gather the lambs of the flock; and the fairer, the weaker and
<PB N="11" REF="028687_0011_0FDA528538521F10"/>
more delicate, but not less amiable, part of the flock, must not be forgot; I mean the female children, whose educa∣tion has been too much neglected: let us place them all under the nurturing hand of a religious education, that they may be made princes and princesses in all the earth where the future events of Providence shall place them, that we may leave them friends to God, to themselves, and to mankind, ornaments to society, and blessings in the world.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You are engaged in an arduous and important work. It is not without its honours and its pleasures; it is pleas∣ing "to bend the twig, and to teach the shoot how to grow;" it is the highest honour to be the most extensively useful.</P>
<P>This town, confiding in you, have committed to your charge and care their most precious treasure; their future hopes, which respect the honour of their families, the ben∣efit of society, and the public interest; these dear children are committed to your care, that you may make them princes in all the earth, i. e, that you may form them to knowledge, virtue and usefulness;—make them good men and good members of society.</P>
<P>If you are faithful, how far the happy influence of your instructions may extend, no one can tell. There is at least a high probability, that you will succeed: for there is a divine proverb which implies a divine promise, "Train up a child in the way that he should go, and when he is old he shall not depart from it."</P>
<P>It is evident that the propagation of religion, virtue and good order will depend, under God, very much upon the influence which your instructions will have upon the minds of youth, who are, or may be, under your care. It will in general form their future conduct, and give a cast to their whole deportment through life, wherever they may be spread through all the earth:—not only so, but they will carry your principles of conduct into social and domes∣tic

life. When they form families of their own, they will, most likely, make it their principal aim to form their families upon the same model; that a thousand descend∣ents, who never saw your faces, nor heard of your names, may owe their honour, their religion, and their happiness, to the influence of your instructions, your counsels, your government and prayers;—God may succeed your honest and faithful endeavours, and by you transmit useful knowledge, and religion in its native purity, to the latest posterity. But if, on the other hand, you should be un∣faithful to your trust, and these dear children, or others who may succeed them, should be neglected, and grow up in ignorance and vice, not subject to government and order, destitute of the principles of virtue; when they form social connections, and enter upon the stage of do∣mestic or civil life, they will be likely to form upon the same model, that, instead of being princes in all the earth, they will be pests to society, and disseminate the seeds of infidelity and irreligion as far as their influence may ex∣tend: and the ill consequences, how far soever they may reach, may, in part, at least, be charged to your account, for we are to be "rewarded according to the fruit of our doings." That your reward may be great, and your honest, prudent and faithful labours may be crowned with success, suffer me, in the last place, to recommend it to you, that you pray with and for your schools; not only because all success depends upon the blessing of God, which is to be drawn down by serious, frequent and fer∣vent prayer, especially where we have to do with the heart, but also because prayer is one very important and essential branch of religious education, and which, therefore, never should be omitted, either in families, where there are children and servants, or in schools, where there must be line upon line, and precept upon precept. When your children see and hear you in a serious and solemn manner address their great Creator, as the supreme and moral go∣vernor of the world, and the fountain of goodness, they will learn to form right apprehensions of his moral and rec∣toral character; their dependence upon him, and obliga∣tions
<PB N="13" REF="028687_0013_0FDA528A699E5BA0"/>
to him; and will be taught the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom: when they hear you humbly confess sin, and implore pardon, they will feel themselves sinners, discover something of the nature of sin, and the need they stand in of the pardoning mercy of God, and be led to repentance: when they hear you present your petitions, in the name and through the atonement and intercession of Jesus Christ, they will insensibly be taught to form some correct apprehensions of this media∣torial character, which lies in the foundation of the christian faith: when they hear you offer up intercessions for others, especially for the afflicted, their susceptible hearts will naturally glow with benevolence to all mankind, and with compassion and sympathy for the distressed, which is a leading trait of that wisdom which is from above; which is first pure and then peaceable—full of love and good fruits: so when they hear themselves, particularly mentioned (as they always should be) they will esteem and love you, and this will give weight to your instruc∣tions, render your paternal government easy, and it will open the young mind to imbibe the sentiments you incul∣cate, and follow the example you set them; and if these are in conformity to him who is the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, they will appear princely in all the earth.</P>

<P>Most of you have been publicly dedicated to God, and these hands of mine have administered the sacred rite to you. I feel tenderly interested in your happiness, as I have, I trust, sincerely consecrated you to God under the form of his initiating ordinance, under which your parents also engaged to bring you up for him. In the discharge of those engagements they have erected houses with every ac∣commodation, and have placed you under instructors who
<PB N="14" REF="028687_0014_0FDA528CBA0086A8"/>
may form you to knowledge and virtue, and make you princes in all the earth. You have now a price put into your hands, to get wisdom; therefore get wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding. If you do not im∣prove the advantage you now enjoy, you will offend God, injure your parents, and wrong your own souls. You have heard that you are our hopes—that you are rising up in our stead; for we are moving off the stage, and must soon make our bed in the dust; for behold we die, but God will be with you if ye be with him; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. You must fear God, love and serve him, and cry unto God, and say, "My Father thou art the guide of my youth." He has said, "I love those who love me, and they who seek me early shall find me." Seek the Lord then while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near. You must love too the Lord Jesus Christ, who first loved us, and died for us, and rose again from the dead, and is gone to heaven, and ever lives, praying for us. And will you not love him in return for the great love wherewith he has loved us? And will you not accept of him for your Saviour, trust in him that you may be saved by him? He was once here on the earth; and though he was the Son of God, the brightness of his Father's glory, and had all power both in heaven and in earth, yet he condescended to take particular notice of youth, of little children, and kindly took them into his arms, and blessed them, and said, "<HI>Of such is the kingdom of heaven.</HI>" Come then to him, and lodge the salvation of your souls in his hands. He has said, Whoso∣ever will come unto me, I will in no wise cast him out. The blessed Redeemer now stands with open arms to re∣ceive you, and to make you the children of God, and the heirs of glory. You must ask of God, in the name of Christ, to give you his holy spirit, to change your hearts, and sanctify your natures, and to adorn your souls with the christian graces, that you may shine as lights in this dark world, and be made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light. And God is as ready to give his holy spi∣rit to them who ask him, as we your parents are ready to
<PB N="15" REF="028687_0015_0FDA528F05F22BC8"/>
give you bread, or any thing else that is good for you. But if you should forget your God, neglect your Saviour, and misimprove your time, and run heedless on, with the thoughtless, vain and vicious youth, in the paths of dissi∣pation and folly, you will make bitter work for repentance, and wound the hearts of your parents and bring down their grey hairs with sorrow to the grave.</P>
<P>But if you should now improve your time, and the advan∣tages you have in your hand, you will rise into honour; and when you shall enter upon the stage of life, you will appear to advantage, as princes in all the earth, the sons of God, without rebuke. And having served God and your generation, according to the will of God, you will meet the approbation of your Lord and Master, and re∣ceive the rewards of his grace in the kingdom of glory.</P>
