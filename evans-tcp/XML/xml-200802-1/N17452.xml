<Q>OF ZEBULUN SUCH AS WENT FORTH TO BATTLE, EX∣PERT IN WAR, WITH ALL INSTRUMENTS OF WAR, FIFTY THOUSAND, WHICH COULD KEEP RANK: THEY WERE NOT OF DOUBLE HEART.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE people of <HI>Israel</HI> were so impressed with the virtues and exploits of <HI>David,</HI> that they gene∣rally united, upon the death of <HI>Saul,</HI> and the defeat of his rivals, to raise him to the throne. They ac∣cordingly sent to him at <HI>Hebron</HI> a chosen band out of each tribe, to testify their readiness to support him against any attempt to hinder his exaltation. Their country had long smarted under foreign and civil wars, and they anxiously expected more happy days under the administration of a Monarch wise, pious, and brave.</P>
<P>THE zeal of the tribe of <HI>Zebulun</HI> was conspicuous on the occasion. <HI>Fifty thousand</HI> of its citizens, with arms in their hands, marched to the capital. These appear to have been the flower of the militia. They were "<HI>such as went forth to battle, expert in war.</HI>" Either they had been actually tried in the season of danger, and
<PB N="4" REF="022576_0003_0FB984A66DBBAC10"/>
their courage and discipline had been proved in bat∣tle; or they had paid such attention to the art mili∣tary, that they were sufficiently trained to contend with the foes of their country. They were accord∣ingly prepared to fight, should events require it.</P>
<P>THEY were properly skilled in the duties of the soldier, and were expert in those evolutions, which were necessary for the successful conduct of war. Though the civil wars appeared to cease by the con∣sent of all parties to acknowledge <HI>David</HI> King, and no public enemy appeared in the land, some foreign power, or domestic usurper, might take advantage of a state of general security, and attempt to strike a fatal blow. They went, therefore, prepared for the worst.</P>
<P>THEY were completely armed, and did not suffer themselves to be deficient in a single article. They marched "<HI>with all instruments of war.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE shield, the helmet, the bow, the sling, the spear, and the sword, were the arms of their age and nation. These were naturally preserved in bright and excel∣lent order by a people of such military taste. They would not allow rust to canker them, or dust to tar∣nish their beauty. Yet, while they took a due care of the appearance of their arms, they would be more attentive to have them fit for use, than for shew. The vain soldier, who preferred ornament to bravery and discipline, would have been an object of their just and

universal contempt.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>—"AMPHIMACUS the vain,</L>

<L>There, whelm'd with waves, the gaudy warrior lies,</L>

</LG>
<BIBL><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></BIBL></NOTE> When the Persians became e∣nervated with pleasure, and relaxed in discipline, they were strangers to that martial spirit, which inspired the people of <HI>Zebulun.</HI> They despised the plain but useful armour of their brave ancestors, and adorned themselves before battle with gold and jewels. These served only to convince the rough Grecians of their loss of their manly feelings, and to urge them more forcibly, to an irresistible and gainful attack.</P>
<P>THE troops of <HI>Zebulun</HI> not only possessed "<HI>all instru∣ments of war,</HI>" but they knew how to use them to the best advantage. They were skilled in the various branches of military discipline. They marched in regular array, and "<HI>could keep rank</HI>" in the field. They felt the importance of order and uniformity in their movements, and of attacking or maintaining the shock of an enemy, with a steady, unbroken front. Each soldier carefully kept the station assigned him, and marched, or countermarched, charged, or retreat∣ed, with a firm and regular step, according to the word of command.</P>
<P>THE sacred <HI>Chronicle</HI> closes the account with a con∣cise and expressive delineation of their character: "<HI>They were not of double heart.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="022576_0005_0FB984B057DD0628"/>
THEY were sincerely and conscientiously attached to the cause in which they were engaged. The He∣brew phrase, literally translated, is, they had "<HI>not a heart and a heart.</HI>" They had not one heart, warm and loud in its loyal, patriotic expressions, and ano∣ther heart, more concealed, selfish, inconstant, and de∣ceitful. They were attached, by a principle of ho∣nour and love, to the late revolution in government, which placed the brave and pious <HI>David</HI> on the throne. They were not mercenary soldiers, follow∣ing the standard of ambitious leaders, for plunder or pay. They were the freemen, the citizens of the state, who viewed their religion, their wives, their children, their property, involved in the liberty, the safety, and the regular government of their country.</P>
<P>THEY had not forgotten the example of their brave ancestors, who, though a small band, ranged themselves under the standard of the gallant <HI>Barak,</HI> wrested <HI>Ju∣dea</HI> from the iron yoke of oppression, and totally de∣feated the numerous regular troops of their tyrant, the King of <HI>Canaan.</HI> They recollected the panegyric strains of the Jewish Prophetess and Heroine,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the context.</NOTE> "<HI>Ze∣bulun</HI> and <HI>Naphtali</HI> were a people, that jeoparded their lives unto the death, in the high places of the field." They wished to emulate their patriotism and military virtues, and welcomed fatigue and danger, if they might but perpetuate the felicity of the nation. Their generous souls spurned the idea of duplicity,
<PB N="7" REF="022576_0006_0FB984B5803C2A58"/>
and they were willing to seal their attachment to the cause, which they had espoused, with their blood.</P>
<P>How happy then must these loyal and virtuous ci∣tizens be, to find their brethren flocking into <HI>Hebron,</HI> from the other tribes, upon the same design! How pleasing to observe discord withdraw herself from the scene, and every eye sparkling with joy, at the close of their civil wars, and the establishment of a <HI>first Magistrate,</HI> who possessed the happy talent of ruling in the hearts of the people!—</P>
<P>THE intire unanimity in this vast military body, and the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Song of <HI>Deborah.</HI></NOTE> "<HI>oneness of heart in all the rest of Israel,</HI>" without exception, "<HI>to make</HI> David <HI>King,</HI>" exhibited him as evidently designated by Heaven to his high office.</P>
<P>THEY could not forbear mutual congratulations on their present prospects. Men, who were <HI>not of double heart,</HI> who sincerely sought the public honour and prosperity, could not but felicitate themselves on the peaceable establishment of their new Monarch. He became the common centre of their affections. Party∣spirit was consequently banished, and they viewed themselves as brethren of one great family, whose duty and glory it was, to imitate the virtues of their royal Sire.</P>
<P>IT was natural for them, therefore, to keep a joyful festival on the occasion—"<HI>Bread and milk, cakes of
<PB N="8" REF="022576_0007_0FB984B6EF1F4F08"/>
figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep,</HI>" were prepared "<HI>abundantly,</HI>" for the whole multitude: "<HI>For there was joy in Israel.</HI> Neither need we be surprised, that <HI>"David," their late gene∣ral,</HI> notwithstanding the difficulties with which he had struggled, and the dark clouds which so oft ob∣scured his horizon, "<HI>waxed greater and greater; for the Lord of hosts was with him.</HI>"</P>
<P>OUR text holds up to view the duties and virtues, which claim the attention of the military character.</P>
<P>HAPPY would it be, my brethren, if reason or reli∣gion laid such restraints upon the passions of men, that it would be unnecessary to have any knowledge of the use of arms! But, as the present degenerate condition of human nature renders this knowledge absolutely requisite, to protect a country against bands of public robbers and murderers, who consi∣der themselves legally authorized by their employers, to deal destruction around them, and to wrest the property and immunities of the citizens from their possession; it is not unsuitable, to devote an anni∣versary to the serious consideration of the character, and duties of a patriot soldier.</P>
<P>AND when a minister of the gospel reflects, on such an anniversary, that he is not addressing a band of mercenaries, who make war their trade, but a select body of independent citizens, who are chiefly con∣versant with the duties of civil life, and who are in∣corporated to defend the land of their nativity against
<PB N="9" REF="022576_0008_0FB984BA46AA5C20"/>
lawless invasions, to seek its <HI>true glory,</HI> and to ce∣ment the ties of friendship among themselves; he may consider the occasion, not wholly foreign to the business of his station.</P>
<P>IF the primitive christians faithfully followed the standard of their <HI>Heathen Emperors,</HI> and assiduously cultivated the profession of arms, that they might tes∣tify their loyalty at the hazard of life; much more may we pay a temporary attention to military science to enable us to maintain the <HI>civil and religious rights</HI> of a <HI>free christian republic.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>patriot, christian soldier</HI> will cordially comply with those laws of the Commonwealth, which mark out the line of his profession. He will be careful, to provide himself with a complete military apparatus, and to be expert in the use of his arms, that he may "<HI>not be ashamed to speak with his enemies in the gate.</HI>" He will be diligent to make proficiency in discipline. He will <HI>keep rank,</HI> while peace allows him securely to practice military evolutions, that he may maintain good order, and a better countenance, when the trump of war summons him to battle. True courage enables him to adhere to that discipline, in the day of trial, which he has learnt in a season of calmness and leisure.</P>
<P>THE simplicity and purity, that reign in his breast, teach him to despise those selfish arguments, which urge the sacrifice of the public good to personal safety or interest. He shudders at the idea of a double heart, influencing his designs or conduct. He sincerely
<PB N="10" REF="022576_0009_0FB984BF76A666F8"/>
and ardently loves the cause and country, to which he has devouted himself. He knows, that his station exposes him to danger in the season of war. But he remembers, that life was given, to aid him in deeds of patriotism and virtue. If he has military talents, he believes, that it would be sinful <HI>to bury them in a napkin,</HI> and that he is accountable for the neglect of them, when the public honor and safety require their improvement. He knows, that he must quit this stage, at the moment decreed by the sovereign Ar∣biter of human life; and he is desirous of acting his part well, till he is called to other climes and scenes.—He is more anxious to merit the esteem of the virtuous and the brave, and to make a suitable appli∣cation of his powers for the promotion of the general good, than to protract the period of his present exist∣ence. "<HI>Save my country,</HI>" is his first and last request to Heaven.</P>
<P>THE <HI>christian soldier</HI> affects not to derive any plea∣sure from the sacking of towns, the desolation of king∣doms, or the shrieks of wounded and dying men. His humane heart sighs at these scenes, and he would rejoice in an honorable opportunity for his sword to sleep for ever in its scabbard.</P>
<P>WHEN he thinks of an agonizing parent deploring the loss of a gallant son, who can never more share his affectionate smiles—of the pale virgin, sighing in vain for the return of her faithful lover, whom the fatal ball or piercing steel forbid to realize past fond
<PB N="11" REF="022576_0010_0FB984C4700AA520"/>
dreams of conjugal felicity, under the roof of peace—of the helpless widow bewailing her slain husband, and her tender offspring asking, with weeping eyes, for a father who once gave them bread;—he can drop a tear, even over a <HI>fallen foe.</HI></P>
<P>HIS own private glory or emolument are not suffi∣cient, in his view, to induce him to harbour a single wish for war. He is reluctant at the thought of draw∣ing his sword, unless the liberty and safety of his country urge.</P>
<P>BUT when these call him to the field, he cheerfully complies with the summons. He is willing to com∣mand, or obey, as his duty and station prompt. Con∣fident of the goodness of a cause, which he has ma∣turely weighed, and committing it, and himself to the patronage of the GOD <HI>of armies,</HI> the <HI>Fautor</HI> of jus∣tice, he directs his unwearied efforts, to promote the great object. He is ready to encounter fatigue, wounds, and death, with a cool determined courage, to repel the bold invader, and to establish, on a per∣manent basis, the rights and privileges of the re∣public.</P>
<P>SHOULD the <HI>christian soldier</HI> fall in his attempts to serve his country, he believes, that he falls not, un∣noticed, by the Father of spirits. He has made him the object of his trust and love. He has often adopt∣ed the language of the Jewish Hero.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalms XXVII. 1.</NOTE><Q><HI>The Lord is my
<PB N="12" REF="022576_0011_0FB984C7589964D0"/>
light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?</HI></Q>—He is willing to be discharged from his earthly labours, as the wisdom and goodness of Heaven may determine. He remembers the animating promise of his divine Captain,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. II. 10.</NOTE> <Q><HI>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI></Q>—Cheerful, at his call, his spirit wings its way to those purer climes, where all the citizens live in perfect harmony, where, instead of the rude din of arms, <Q><HI>joy and gladness shall be found, thanksgiving and the voice of</HI> perpetual <HI>melody.</HI></Q></P>
<P>How necessary then is the aid of revealed religion, to render the military character complete!—While it reprobates the <Q><HI>double minded man, as unstable in all his ways,</HI></Q> it teaches that purity, sincerity, and disinterestedness of soul, which are requisite to a faith∣ful discharge of duty in every station. While it leads us to a careful eradication of those <Q><HI>lusts, from which</HI> unjust <HI>wars and fightings arise,</HI></Q> it affords the best motives to courage and fidelity, in crushing the at∣tempts of men, in whom these lusts predominate.</P>
<P>IT exhibits a bright catalogue of military worthies, who in different ages, <Q><HI>played the men for their God, and the cities of their God.</HI></Q> It animates with the example of an <HI>Abraham,</HI> a <HI>Joshua,</HI> a <HI>Caleh,</HI> a <HI>Jonathan,</HI> a <HI>David,</HI> a <HI>Jehosaphat,</HI> a <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> in whom piety and bravery shone illustrious. It shews us, how a
<PB N="13" REF="022576_0012_0FB984CA1426C0A0"/>
stripling, unskilled in arms, but reposing his trust in <HI>Jehovah,</HI> can meet undaunted the gigantic warrior, at whose presence a whole camp trembles, and calm∣ly reply to his haughty air and menaces,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. XVII. 45.</NOTE> <Q>Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear; but I come to thee in the name of the <HI>Lord of Hosts.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT teaches us, that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. XIV. 7.</NOTE> <Q><HI>no man should live to himself or die to himself,</HI></Q> and that we should<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">II. Cor. XII. 15.</NOTE> <Q><HI>spend and be spent</HI></Q> for the general good, even though we meet with <HI>ungrateful returns.</HI></P>
<P>THE soldier, therefore, who acts under the eye of his divine Commander, and is influenced by the exam∣ples of patriotism and fortitude, which the sacred scriptures contain, will not fail to discharge the du∣ties of his post. His exertions will be the result of firm unshaken virtue, not of mechanical or mercena∣ry principles. His country's good will be, in his es∣teem, the noblest reward of these exertions.</P>
<P>THE subject will be closed with a few reflections, and an address to the military gentlemen, at whose request we are convened.</P>
<P>How natural is it on such an occasion, to lament that depravity of human nature, which has rendered this globe a theatre of desolation in every age, and necessitates the peaceful citizen to cultivate an ac∣quaintance with the use of arms, left he fall a prey to tyranny, ambition or avarice! How oft does the be∣nevolent
<PB N="14" REF="022576_0013_0FB984CD4D9708D0"/>
mind turn abhorrent from the history of na∣tions, while its pages appear stained with the blood of millions, and recount little more than a continued and awful succession of wars and battles!</P>
<P><Q>IT is agreed, says Mr. Rollin, that wars, under∣taken solely from views of interest or ambition, are real robberies.</Q></P>
<P>BUT an impartial spectator will generally perceive nations actuated by these views in their contentions. To enlarge the boundaries of an empire, already of suf∣ficient extent for the maintenance of a peaceable and regular government—to gain some favorite point of honor, which, when gained, is but an empty name, or to resent some affront, which is always more tolerable than the calamities of war, and which is often too in∣significant to engage the serious attention of chil∣dren; desolation is commissioned to spread wide her ravages, and torrents of human blood must be delibe∣rately shed.</P>
<P>How fallen, then, is man, selfish, destroying man, from his original perfection! "<HI>God made him upright,</HI>" and gave him the law of love for his guide. "<HI>But he hath sought out many</HI>" wanton "<HI>inventions,</HI>" foreign to the purity and benevolence of religion.</P>
<P>THE gospel explicitly requires us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. XII, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> "to follow peace with all men—<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. IV, 31.</NOTE> to put away bitterness, wrath, clam∣our and malice—to<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Phil. II. 4.</NOTE> look not every man on his own,
<PB N="15" REF="022576_0014_0FB984CFF220DED8"/>
but every man also on the things of others." How re∣pugnant then is <HI>"the spirit, which is of the world" to "the spirit, which is of God!"</HI></P>
<P>WHILE unbridled selfishness presides in human councils, and nations confine their regards <HI>solely</HI> to themselves, vain will be all human schemes, however benevolent in their orign, to banish war from our globe. A divine influence, powerfully impressed on the hearts of mankind, will alone effectually teach them genuine philanthropy, and induce them to live and love as brethren.</P>
<P>How soothing then, how transporting the idea, to the humane, the christian bosom, that the period ra∣pidly rolls on, when this influence, with concurring providential events, shall establish the golden age of the world,—when "the nations shall not learn war any more"—when "Ephraim shall not envy Judah, nor Judah vex Ephraim"—when "<HI>the righteous,</HI>" ru∣lers and their subjects, jointly under the influence of religion, "<HI>shall flourish, and abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth.</HI>"</P>
<P>BUT I hasten to close the subject by a particular ad∣dress to the worthy gentlemen, who compose the mili∣tary body before us.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>AT the request of your ANCIENT AND HONORABLE SOCIETY, I have attempted to address you on the du∣ties, and objects of your profession. A century and a
<PB N="16" REF="022576_0015_0FB984D10D948060"/>
half of years have revolved since the first establishment of your company by our brave and venerable ances∣tors. The purest patriotism induced the measure of incorporating a society of respectable citizens, who should be viewed as the flower of the militia, and a school for the diffusion of military knowledge in New-England.</P>
<P>To defend their country against the ravages of her enemies; to protect the civil and religious rights of the people, was their leading motive.</P>
<P>THEY were too much under the influence of a just and benevolent religion, to indulge a wish for an occa∣sion to display their skill and courage in the rough bu∣siness of war. But they believed it their duty, to use the best means in their power, for the protection of a country, in the settlement of which the providence of the <HI>Almighty</HI> had so visibly interposed, and where they enjoyed those immunities, that were dearer than life.</P>
<P>UUINFLUENCED by ambition or injustice, and inspir∣ed with a zeal for the public good, they established a military institution, the beneficial effects of which might be felt in subsequent years, and ages.</P>
<P>POSTERITY approved the plan, and the children have risen up successively in the room of their fathers, to prosecute it.</P>
<P>THE fairest names in New-England have graced your military rolls. Each succeeding generation has seen, in your number, men, inspired with the purest
<PB N="17" REF="022576_0016_0FB984D4CD07E830"/>
principles of philanthropy, men, who derived their courage from a sincere confidence in the <HI>Lord of hosts,</HI> and who esteemed it their highest honor to approve themselves "<HI>good soldiers of Jesus Christ.</HI>" Each ge∣neration has had occasion to admire the pure republi∣canism of your institution, while officers of the first distinction have condescended to enter the ranks, and discharge the duties of a private centinel, to stamp a dignity on the station of a <HI>patriot soldier.</HI></P>
<P>WITH pleasure we observe the present respectability of your company, and men of worth, in the various departments of life, uniting in the friendly discharge of the military office.</P>
<P>YOUR appearance, on this anniversary of your elec∣tion, exhibits an agreeable epitome, and illustration of our text. The state of your arms and discipline gives you an honorable resemblance to the warlike and patriotic tribe, depicted by the sacred historian.</P>
<P>LIKE the military citizens of Zebulun, you profess to despise <HI>a double heart,</HI> to be actuated by the purest love of your country.</P>
<P>WE rejoice to behold among you men, who "have jeoparded their lives in the high places of the field," whose courage, coolness, and discipline have been con∣spicuous on eminent occasions, and who have contribut∣ed largely to the establishment of our national military character, and the independence of the <HI>United States of America.</HI> Your company has discovered the most un∣equivocal
<PB N="18" REF="022576_0017_0FB984DA81885198"/>
attachment to those tried worthies, who fought our battles, and by their valour and discipline, under God, have wrought out our political salvation. If these have been forgotten, <HI>after the hour of danger,</HI> by some, who once eyed, and invocated them as the sa∣viours of the land, you have evidenced that you are <HI>not of double heart,</HI> by the fullest tokens of your esteem and gratitude. While it must give you a generous plea∣sure, to testify your veneration, by adding some of their names to the bright catalogue of your leaders, they must be inspired with the warmest affection for the society: And your proficiency in discipline, un∣der their eye, must reflect mutual honor, and satisfac∣tion.</P>
<P>IT is a pleasing circumstance, that it is unne∣cessary, to point you to the numerous worthies of an∣tient Rome, or to bring to your view the distinguish∣ing talents and virtues of a CAMILLUS, a CINCINNA∣TUS, a FABIUS, a REGULUS, the DECII, the SCIPIOS, and other eminent characters in your line. Your own history will furnish you with heroes, who deserve your imitation.</P>
<P>EMULATE then the civil and religious virtues of your honorable fathers, who have trodden in the steps, in which you are called to follow them. Let <HI>your more noble, enlarged object</HI> stimulate you to preserve, to in∣crease the respectability, the usefulness of a company, which was first instituted to defend a part of <HI>the de∣pendent territories of Britain,</HI> but is now invited and engaged to extend its assisting arm in behalf of <HI>a rising,
<PB N="19" REF="022576_0018_0FB984DFA217C880"/>
independent, and extensive empire.</HI> But, while you re∣member, with admiration, your valiant ancestors, and the heroes, who have trodden the stage in the late war; while you cease not to revere your exalted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Excellency <HI>John Hancock.</HI> Esq.</NOTE> <HI>Commander in Chief,</HI> whose illustrious qualities, and engaging be∣neficent virtues, as a <HI>Patriot,</HI> a <HI>Magistrate,</HI> and a <HI>Citi∣zen,</HI> are too well known, to need a distinct enumera∣tion;—your bosom should beat gratitude to that <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI> which has allowed you to contemplate the brightest military pattern, which, perhaps, was ever exhibited to human view. A WASHINGTON, like David of ancient days, has been placed by the unanimous voice of his country at the head of her <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>military</HI> go∣vernment. Our General in war, is our Leader in peace.</P>
<P>EAGERLY catch that military spirit, which sired his early youth, and has not yet ceased to glow in his bosom. Ponder those <HI>christian virtues,</HI> which reflect the bright∣est splendor on his character, and qualify him for that <HI>"crown of righteousness," which alone can pay, and more than pay,</HI> the debt due from his country. Think of his piety and patriotism, which have been invariably combined with his exalted talents to bless it, and to ex∣hibit an instructive example for the imitation of heroes in every nation and age.</P>
<P>WHILE then, by your sedulous improvements in discipline, you, with your other worthy brethren of the militia, testify your attention to his important obser∣vation: "The Militia of this country must be consi∣dered
<PB N="20" REF="022576_0019_0FB984E75C86C3D0"/>
as the palladium of our security, and the first effectual resort in case of hostility:" May you not for∣get your near concern in his devout prayer for you, for all the inhabitants of the United States;—"That we may demean ourselves with that charity, humility and pacific temper, which were the characteristics of <HI>the divine Author of our Religion,</HI> and WITHOUT AN HUM∣BLE IMITATION OF WHOSE EXAMPLE, WE CAN NEVER HOPE TO BE A HAPPY NATION"!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. Washington's circular Letter.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN this prayer is effectually heard by that gra∣cious Being who "<HI>has all hearts in his hand,</HI>" AME∣RICA will be adorned with a new glory, reflected from the inspiring example of her Chief; and the FATHER <HI>of these States</HI> shall live, when dead, in the resembling lineaments of his children.</P>
<P>LONG, long may he survive to bless us by his exam∣ple, his prayers, and the continued efforts of his wis∣dom and goodness! Long, long may we feel the most ardent gratitude to a compassionate God, who, again and again, has snatched him, <HI>for our sake,</HI> from im∣pending death, and restored him to the embraces of an affectionate people! May he live to see still brighter days dawn on his country, to see LIBERTY and PEACE, accompanied by PURE RELIGION, go forth from these favored climes, to bless a WORLD!</P>
<P>THEN, <HI>at least,</HI> AMERICA will deeply feel the exhila∣rating address of one her warlike and poetic SONS:</P>

<L>Arise, and spread thy virgin charms abroad,</L>
<L>Thou last, thou fairest offspring of a God;</L>
<L>Extend thy view, where future blessings lie,</L>
<L>And ope new prospects to th' enraptur'd eye!</L>
<L>See a NEW ERA on this globe begun,</L>
<L>And circling years in brighter orbits run!</L>
<L>See the <HI>fair down of universal peace,</HI></L>
<L>When hell-born discord thro' the world shall cease!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"AND thou SUPREME, whose hand sustains this ball,</L>
<L>Before whose nod the nations rise, and fall;</L>
<L>Propituous smile, and shed diviner charms,</L>
<L>On this blest land, the queen of arts and arms:</L>
<L>Make the great empire rise on wisdom's plan,</L>
<L>The seat of bliss, and last retreat of man."</L>
