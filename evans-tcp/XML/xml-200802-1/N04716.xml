<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>EN, Brethren and Fathers, and all ye to whom I am about to preach the Kingdom of GOD, —I suppose you need not be informed, that being indispensa∣bly obliged to be absent on your late THANKSGIVING-DAY, I could not shew my Obedience to the Governor's Proclamation, as my own Inclination led me, or as might just∣ly be expected from, and demanded of me—But as the Occasion of that Day's <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> is yet, and I trust ever will be, fresh in our Memory, I cannot think that a Discourse on that Subject can even now be altogether unseasonable.—I take it for granted further, that you need not be informed, that among the various Motives which are generally urged to enforce Obedience to the divine Commands, that of <HI>Love</HI> is the most powerful and cogent.—The <HI>Terrors</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> may afright and awe, but <HI>Love</HI> dissolves
<PB N="4" REF="005883_0003_102759B8B1C086C8"/>
and melts the Heart.—The <HI>Love</HI> of CHRIST, says the great Apostle of the Gentiles, <HI>constrain∣eth</HI> us.—Nay, <HI>Love</HI> is so absolutely necessary for those that name the Name of CHRIST, that without it, their <HI>Obedience</HI> cannot truly be stiled <HI>Evangelical,</HI> or be acceptable in the Sight of God—<HI>Although,</HI> says the same Apostle, <HI>I bestow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and though I give my Body to be burnt,</HI> and <HI>have not</HI> CHARITY, (<HI>i. e.</HI> un∣less unfeigned Love to GOD, and to Mankind for His great Name's sake, be the Principle of such Actions) howsoever it may benefit others, <HI>it profiteth</HI> ME <HI>nothing</HI>—This is the constant Language of the lively Oracles of GOD—And, from them it is equally plain, that nothing has a greater Tendency to beget and excite such an <HI>obediential Love</HI> in us, than a serious and fre∣quent Consideration of the manifold Mercies we receive Time after Time from the Hands of our heavenly Father—The Royal <HI>Psalmist,</HI> who had the Honour of being stiled, <HI>the Man after GOD's own Heart,</HI> had an abundant Experi∣ence of this.—Hence it is, that whilst he is musing on the divine Goodness, the Fire of di∣vine Love kindles in his Soul; and, <HI>out of the Abundance of his Heart, his Mouth speaketh</HI> such grateful and extatick Language as this—<Q>What shall I render unto the Lord for all His Mer∣cies? Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me bless his holy Name.</Q>—And why?
<PB N="5" REF="005883_0004_102759BB386364F0"/>
<Q>;Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities, who healeth all thy Diseases, who redeemeth thy Life from Destruction, who crowneth thee with loving Kindness and tender Mercies.</Q> And when the same Holy Man of GOD had a Mind to stir up the People of the <HI>Jews</HI> to set about a <HI>national Reformation,</HI> as the most weighty and prevailing Argument he could make use of for that pur∣pose, he lays before them, as it were, in a Draught, many national Mercies, and distin∣guishing Deliverances, which had been confer∣ed upon, and wrought out for them, by the most high GOD.—The <HI>Psalm</HI> to which the Words of our Text belong, is a pregnant Proof of this; it being a kind of Epitome or Com∣pendium of the whole <HI>Jewish</HI> History: At least it contains an Enumeration of many signal and extraordinary Blessings the <HI>Israelites</HI> had received from GOD, and also the Improvement they were in Duty bound to make of them, viz. <HI>to observe his Statutes and keep his Laws.</HI>—</P>
<P>To run through all the Particulars of the <HI>Psalm,</HI> or draw a Parallel (which might with great ease and justice be done) between God's dealings with us and the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old—To e∣numerate all the national Mercies bestow'd upon, and remarkable Deliverances wrought out for the Kingdoms of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> from the Infant State of WILLIAM the Con∣queror, to their present Manhood, and more than <HI>Augustan</HI> Maturity, under the auspicious
<PB N="6" REF="005883_0005_102759C0963512E8"/>
Reign of our dread and rightful Sovereign KING GEORGE the Second; howsoever pleasing and profitable it might be at any other time, would, at this Juncture, prove, if not an irksome, yet an unseasonable Undertaking.——</P>
<P>The Occasion of the late Solemnity, I mean the Suppression of a most horrid and <HI>unnatural Rebel∣lion,</HI> will afford more than sufficient Matter for a Discourse of this Nature, and furnish us with abundant Motives to love and obey that glori∣ous <HI>Jehovah, who giveth</HI> SALVATION <HI>unto</HI> KINGS, <HI>and delivers His People from the hurtful Sword.</HI></P>
<P>Need I make an Apology, before this Audi∣tory, if, in order to see the Greatness of our late Deliverance, I should remind you of the many unspeakable Blessings which we have for a Course of Years enjoy'd, during the Reign of His pre∣sent MAJESTY, and the gentle mild Admini∣stration under which we live?—Without justly incurring the Censure of <HI>giving flattering Titles</HI> I believe all who have Eyes to see, and Ears to hear, and are but a little acquainted with our publick Affairs, must acknowledge, that we have one of the best of KINGS.—It is now above <HI>Nineteen Years</HI> since he began to reign o∣ver Us—And yet, was he to be seated on a Royal Throne, and were all his Subjects placed before him. Was he to address them as <HI>Samuel</HI> once addressed the <HI>Israelites,</HI> <Q>Behold here I am, <HI>Old and Greyheaded,</HI> witness against me before the Lord, whose Ox have I taken? Or whose
<PB N="7" REF="005883_0006_102759C21D6F6A68"/>
Ass have I taken? Or whom have I defraud∣ed? Whom have I oppressed?</Q> They must, if they would do him Justice, make the same Answer as was given to <HI>Samuel,</HI> <Q>Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us.</Q> What <HI>Tertullus,</HI> by way of Flattery, said to <HI>Felix,</HI> may with the strictest Justice be applied to our Sovereign, <Q>By thee we enjoy great Quietness, and very worthy Deeds have been done unto our Nation by thy Providence.</Q>—He has been indeed <HI>Pater Patriae,</HI> a Father to our Country, and, tho' old and greyheaded, has jeoparded his precious Life for us in the High Places of the Field.—Nor has he less deserved that great and glorious Title which the Lord promises KINGS should sustain in the latter Days, I mean, <HI>a nursing Father of the Church.</HI>—For not only the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as by Law established, but <HI>Christians</HI> of every Denomination whatsoever have enjoyed their re∣ligious, as well as civil, Liberties.—As there has been no <HI>authorized</HI> Oppression in the State, so there has been no <HI>publickly allowed</HI> Persecuti∣on in the Church—We breathe indeed in a free Air; as free (if not freer) both as to temporals and spirituals, as any Nation under Heaven.—Nor is the Prospect likely to terminate in his MAJES∣TY's Death, which I pray GOD long to defer. —Our Princesses are disposed of to Protestant Powers—And we have great Reason to be <HI>assur∣ed</HI> that the present <HI>Heir Apparent,</HI> and <HI>His Con∣sort,</HI> are like minded with their Royal Father.—
<PB N="8" REF="005883_0007_102759C6ADA5AF28"/>
And I cannot help thinking, that it is a peculiar Blessing vouchsafed us by the KING of KINGS, that his present MAJESTY has been continued so long among us—For now His <HI>immediate Successor</HI> (though his present Situa∣tion obliges him, as it were, to lie <HI>dormant</HI>) has great and glorious. Opportunities, which we have Reason to think he daily improves, of ob∣serving and weighing the national Affairs, con∣sidering the various Steps and Turns of Go∣vernment, and consequently of laying in a large Fund of Experience to make him a wise and great Prince, if ever GOD should call him to sway the <HI>British</HI> Sceptre—Happy art thou, O <HI>England!</HI> Happy art thou, O <HI>America,</HI> who on every side are thus highly favoured!</P>
<P>But, alas! how soon would this happy Scene have shifted, and a melancholly gloomy Prospect have succeeded in its room, had the Rebels gained their Point, and a Popish abjured Pretender been forced upon the <HI>British</HI> Throne!—For, suppo∣sing his Birth not to be <HI>spurious,</HI> (as we have great Reason to think it really was) what could we expect from one, descended from a Fa∣ther, who, when <HI>Duke of York,</HI> put all <HI>Scotland</HI> into Confusion, and afterwards, when crowned KING of <HI>England,</HI> for his Arbitrary and tyran∣nical Government both in Church and State, was justly obliged to abdicate the Throne, by the Assertors of <HI>British</HI> Liberty? Or, suppos∣ing the horrid Plot first hatched in Hell, and
<PB N="9" REF="005883_0008_102759CAF04E3218"/>
afterwards nursed at <HI>Rome,</HI> had taken Place; supposing, I say, the old Pretender should have exchanged his <HI>Cardinal's Cap</HI> for a <HI>Triple Crown,</HI> and have transferred his pretended Title (as it is reported he has done) to his <HI>Eldest Son,</HI> what was all this for, but that, by being advanc∣ed to the <HI>Popedom,</HI> he might rule both Son and Subjects with less controul, and, by their united Interest, keep the three Kingdoms of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> in greater Vassalage to the See of <HI>Rome?</HI> Ever since this <HI>unnatural Rebellion</HI> broke out, I have looked up∣on the young Pretender as the <HI>Phaeton</HI> of the pre∣sent Age.—He is ambitiously and presumptuous∣ly aiming to seat himself in the Throne of our rightful Sovereign KING GEORGE, which he is no more capable of <HI>maintaining</HI> than PHAETON was to guide the <HI>Chariot of the Sun</HI>; and had he succeeded in his Attempt, like him, would only have set the World on Fire.—It is true, to do him Justice, he has deserved well of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and, in all probability, will hereafter be canonized amongst the <HI>noble Order</HI> of their <HI>fictitious Saints</HI>—But, with what an I∣ron Rod we might expect to have been bruized, had his Troops been Victorious, may easily be imagin'd from those <HI>cruel</HI> Orders, found in the Pockets of some of his Officers, <HI>"Give no Quarter to the Elector</HI>'s <HI>Troops.</HI>"—Add to this, that there was great Reason to suspect, that, upon the first News of the Success of the Re∣bels,
<PB N="10" REF="005883_0009_102759CC79BD3C18"/>
a <HI>general Massacre</HI> was intended—So that if the Lord had not been on our side, <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> not to say <HI>America,</HI> would, in a few Weeks, or Months, have been an <HI>Accidama,</HI> a <HI>Field of Blood.</HI>—Besides, was a <HI>Popish Pretender</HI> to rule over us, instead of being represented by a <HI>free Parliament,</HI> and governed by Laws made <HI>by their Consent,</HI> as we now are, we should shortly have had only the <HI>Shadow</HI> of one, and, it may be, no Parliament at all.—This is the na∣tive Product of a <HI>Popish Government,</HI> and what the unhappy Family, from which this YOUNG ADVENTURER pretends to be descended, has al∣ways aimed at.—Arbitrary Principles he has sucked in with his Mother's Milk; and if he had been so honest, instead of that immature Motto upon his Standard, <HI>Tandem triumphans,</HI> only to have put, <HI>Stet pro Ratione Voluntas,</HI> he had given us a short, but true, Portraiture of the Na∣ture of his intended, but, blessed be GOD, now defeated Reign.—And, why should I mention, that the Loss of the <HI>national Debt,</HI> and the Dis∣solution of the present <HI>happy Union</HI> between the two Kingdoms, would have been the imme∣diate Consequences of his Success, as he himself declares in his second Manifesto, dated from <HI>Holy∣rood House</HI>? These are Evils, and great ones too; but then they are only Evils of a tempo∣rary Nature—They chiefly concern the Body, and must necessarily terminate in the Grave— But, alas! What an Inundation of spiritual
<PB N="11" REF="005883_0010_102759D11FE43AF8"/>
Mischiefs would soon have overflowed the <HI>Church,</HI> and what unspeakable Danger should we and our Posterity have been reduced to in respect to our <HI>better Parts,</HI> our precious and immortal Souls? How soon would whole swarms of <HI>Monks, Dominicans</HI> and <HI>Friars,</HI> like so many <HI>Locusts,</HI> have overspread and plagued the Nati∣on?—With what winged speed would foreign <HI>titular Bishops</HI> have posted over in order to take Possession of their respective Sees?—How quickly would our <HI>Universities</HI> have been filled with Youths who have been sent abroad by their <HI>Popish Parents,</HI> in order to drink in all the Superstitions of the <HI>Church of Rome</HI>?—What a speedy Period would have been put to Socie∣ties of <HI>all</HI> Kinds, for <HI>promoting Christian Know∣ledge,</HI> and <HI>propagating the Gospel in foreign Parts?</HI> How soon would our Pulpits have every where been filled with those old antichristian Doctrines, <HI>Freewill, Meriting by Works, Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Works of Supererogation, Passive Obedience, Non-resistance,</HI> and all the other A∣bominations of the <HI>Whore of Babylon</HI>?—How soon would our <HI>Protestant Charity-Schools</HI> in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> have been pulled down, our BIBLES forcibly taken from us, and <HI>Ignorance</HI> every where set up as the <HI>Mother of Devotion</HI>?—How soon should we have been de∣priv'd of that invaluable Blessing, LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE, and been obliged to com∣mence (what they falsely call) <HI>Catholicks,</HI> or
<PB N="12" REF="005883_0011_102759D430F9DF50"/>
submit to all the Tortures which a <HI>biggotted Zeal,</HI> guided by the most <HI>cruel Principles,</HI> could possibly invent?—How soon would that <HI>Mother of Harlots</HI> have made herself once more drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and the whole Tribe even of <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> them∣selves, been brought to this <HI>Dilemma,</HI> either to die Martyrs for, (tho' I never yet heard of one that did so) or, contrary to all their most avow∣ed Principles, renounce their great <HI>Diana,</HI> un∣assisted, unenlightened Reason?—But I must have done,—lest while I am speaking against <HI>Antichrist,</HI> I should unawares fall myself, and lead my Hearers into an <HI>antichristian</HI> Spirit.— True and undefiled Religion will <HI>regulate</HI> our Zeal, and teach us to treat even the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> with no harsher Language than that which the Angel gave his grand employer Satan, <HI>The Lord rebuke thee.</HI></P>
<P>Glory be to His great NAME, the LORD has rebuked him, and that too at a Time when we had little reason to expect such a BLESSING at GOD's Hands.—My <HI>dear Hearers,</HI> neither the present Frame of my Heart, nor the Occasion of your late solemn Meeting, lead me to give you a Detail of our <HI>Publick Vices</HI>—Tho' alas! they are so many, so notorious, and withal of such a Crimson-dye, that a Gospel Minister would not be altogether <HI>inexcusable,</HI> was he, even on such a joyful Occasion, <HI>to lift up his Voice like a Trumpet, to shew the</HI> British Nation
<PB N="13" REF="005883_0012_102759D6E568C070"/>
<HI>their Transgression, and the People of</HI> America <HI>their Sin.</HI>—However, tho' I would not cast a dismal Shade upon the pleasing Picture the Cause of our late rejoycings set before us; yet thus much <HI>may,</HI> and <HI>ought</HI> to be said, <HI>viz.</HI> that, as GOD has not dealt so <HI>bountifully</HI> with any People as with us, so no Nation under Heaven has dealt more <HI>ungratefully</HI> with Him.—We have been, like <HI>Capernaum,</HI> lifted up to Hea∣ven in Priviledges, and, for the Abuse of them, like her, have deserved to be thrust down into Hell.—How well soever it may be with us, in respect to our civil and ecclesiastick Constituti∣on, yet, in regard to our Morals, <HI>Isaiah</HI>'s De∣scription of the Jewish Polity is too too ap∣plicable, <Q>The whole Head is sick, the whole Heart is faint, from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of our Feet, we are full of Wounds and Bruises, and putrifying Sores.</Q> We have, <HI>Jeshurun</HI> like, <HI>waxed fat and kicked.</HI>—We have played the Harlot against GOD, both in regard to Principles and Practice.—<HI>Our Gold is become dim, and our fine Gold changed.</HI>—We have crucified the Son of GOD afresh, and put him to an open shame—Nay, CHRIST has been wounded in the House of his Friends—And every thing long ago seemed to threaten an im∣mediate Storm.—But, Oh the Long-suffering and Goodness of GOD to-us-ward! When all Things seemed ripe for Destruction, and Mat∣ters were come to such a Crisis, that GOD's
<PB N="14" REF="005883_0013_102759DE54DD81C8"/>
praying People began to think, that tho' <HI>Noah, Daniel</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> were living, they would only deliver their own Souls; yet then, <HI>in the midst of Judgment, the most High remembred Mercy,</HI> and when a Popish Enemy was breaking in upon us like a <HI>Flood,</HI> the Lord himself graciously lifted up a <HI>Standard.</HI></P>
<P>This to me does not seem to be one of the most unfavourable Circumstances, which have attended this MIGHTY DELIVERANCE; nor do I think you will look upon it as altogether unworthy <HI>Your</HI> Observation— Had this <HI>Cockatrice</HI> indeed been crushed in the Egg, and the <HI>Young Pretender</HI> driven back up∣on his first Arrival, it would undoubtedly have been a great Blessing.—But not so great as <HI>that</HI> for which you lately assembled to give GOD THANKS: For then His MAJESTY would not have had so good an Opportunity of know∣ing his Enemies, or trying his Friends.—The <HI>British</HI> Subjects would, in a Manner, have lost the fairest Occasion that ever offered to express their Loyalty and Gratitude to their RIGHTFUL SOVEREIGN.—<HI>France</HI> would not have been so greatly <HI>humbled</HI>; nor such an effectual Stop have been put, as we trust there now is, to any such further <HI>Popish Plot,</HI> to rob us of all that is near and dear to us.—<HI>Out of the Eater</HI> therefore <HI>hath come forth Meat, and out of the Strong hath come forth Sweetness.</HI>—The <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Eldest Son is suffered not only to land in the <HI>North-West
<PB N="15" REF="005883_0014_102759E0D99170D0"/>
Highlands</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but in a little while to become a <HI>great Band.</HI>—This for a Time is not believed, but treated as a Thing altogether in∣credible.—The Friends of the Government in those Parts, not for want of <HI>Loyalty,</HI> but of <HI>sufficient Authority</HI> to take up Arms, could not resist him—He is permitted to pass on with his terrible Banditti, and, like the <HI>Comet</HI> that was lately seen (a Presage it may be of this ve∣ry Thing) spreads his <HI>baleful Influences</HI> all a∣round him.—He is likewise permitted to gain a <HI>short liv'd Triumph</HI> by a Victory over a Bo∣dy of our Troops at <HI>Preston-Pans,</HI> and to take a <HI>temporary</HI> Possession of the Metropolis of <HI>Scotland.</HI>—Of this he makes his Boast, and in∣forms the Publick (they are his own Words) that <Q>Providence had hitherto favoured him with <HI>wonderful Success,</HI> led him in the Way to <HI>Victory,</HI> and to the Capital of the <HI>ancient</HI> Kingdom, though he came without foreign Aid.</Q> —Nay he is further permitted to press into the very Heart of <HI>England.</HI>—But now the <HI>Almighty</HI> interposes,—<HI>Hitherto he was to go, and no further.</HI> —Here were his malicious Designs to be staid— His Troops of a sudden are driven back—Away they post to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> and there they are suffered not only to increase, but also to collect themselves into a large Body, that having, as it were, what <HI>Caligula</HI> once wish'd <HI>Rome</HI> had, <HI>but one Neck, they might be cut off with one Blow.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="005883_0015_102759E2904D2C08"/>The <HI>Time, Nature,</HI> and <HI>Instrument</HI> of this Victory deserve our Notice.—It was on a gene∣ral FAST-DAY, when the Clergy and good Peo-of <HI>Scotland</HI> were lamenting the <HI>Disloyalty</HI> of their <HI>perfidious</HI> Countrymen, and like <HI>Moses</HI> lifting up their Hands, that <HI>Amaleck</HI> might not prevail—The Victory was total and decisive— Little Blood was spilt on the Side of the Roy∣alists—And to crown all, DUKE WILLIAM, His MAJESTY's YOUNGEST SON, has the Ho∣nour of first driving back, and then defeating the Rebel Army—A PRINCE, who in his In∣fancy and Nonage, gave early Proofs of an <HI>un∣common Bravery,</HI> and <HI>Nobleness</HI> of Mind.—A PRINCE, whose Courage has encreased with his Years; who returned Wounded from the Battle of <HI>Dettingen,</HI> behav'd with surprizing Bravery at <HI>Fontenoy,</HI> and now, by a Conduct and Mag∣nanimity becoming the high Office he sustains, like his glorious Predecessor the <HI>Prince of O∣range,</HI> has once more delivered three Kingdoms from the Dread of <HI>Popish</HI> Cruelty, and arbitra∣ry Power—What renders it still more remarka∣ble is this—The Day on which His Highness gained this Victory was the Day after his BIRTH-DAY, when he was entering on the <HI>Twenty Sixth</HI> Year of his Age;—And when <HI>Sullivan,</HI> one of the Pretender's Privy Council, like another <HI>Ahitophel,</HI> advised the Rebels to give our Soldiers Battle, presuming they were surfeited and overcharged with their Yesterday's
<PB N="17" REF="005883_0016_102759EAEE5A5158"/>
Rejoycings, and consequently unfit to make any great Stand against them—But Glory be to GOD, who catches the Wise in their own Craftiness! His <HI>Counsel,</HI> like <HI>Ahitophel</HI>'s, proves abortive—Both General and Soldiers were prepared to meet them—God <HI>taught their Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight,</HI> and brought the DUKE, after a <HI>bloody</HI> and <HI>deserved</HI> Slaughter of some thousands of the Rebels, with most of his brave Soldiers, victorious from the field.</P>
<P>Were we to take a distinct view of this nota∣ble Transaction, and trace it in all the particu∣lar Circumstances that have attended it, I believe we must with one Heart and Voice con∣fess, that if it be a <HI>Mercy</HI> for a State to be delivered from a worse than a <HI>Catiline</HI>'s Con∣spiracy; or a Church to be rescued from a hotter than a <HI>Dioclesian</HI> Persecution—If it be a <HI>Mercy</HI> to be delivered from a Religion that turns Plow-shares into Swords and Pruning-Hooks into Spears, and makes it <HI>meritorious</HI> to shed Protestant Blood—If it be a <HI>Mercy</HI> to have all our present invaluable Priviledges, both in Church and State, secured to us more than ever—If it be a <HI>Mercy</HI> to have these GREAT THINGS done for us at a Season when, for our crying Sins both Church and State justly deserved to be overturned;—And if it be a <HI>Mercy</HI> to have all this brought about for us, under GOD, by one of the BLOOD

ROYAL, a <HI>Prince</HI> acting with an Experience far above his Years.—If any or all of these are <HI>Mercies,</HI> then have you lately commemorated one of the greatest Mercies that ever the glo∣rious GOD vouchsaf'd the <HI>British</HI> Nation.—</P>
<P>And shall we not REJOYCE and give THANKS? Should we refuse, would not the Stones cry out against us?—<HI>Rejoyce</HI> then we may and ought: But, Oh! let our <HI>Rejoicing</HI> be in the LORD, and run in a religious Channel. This we find has been the Practice of GOD's People in all Ages.—When he was pleased, with a mighty Hand and outstretched Arm to lead the <HI>Israelites</HI> through the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> as on dry Ground. <Q>Then sang <HI>Moses</HI> and the Children of <HI>Israel;</HI> and <HI>Mi∣riam</HI> the Prophetess, the Sister of <HI>Aaron,</HI> took a Timbrel in her Hand, and all the Women went out after her. And <HI>Miriam</HI> answered them, sing ye to the LORD; for he hath triumphed gloriously.</Q> When GOD subdued <HI>Jabin</HI> the King of <HI>Canaan</HI> before the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> <Q>Then sang <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak</HI> on that Day, saying, Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of <HI>Israel.</HI></Q> When the Ark was brought back out of the Hands of the <HI>Philistines, David,</HI> tho' a King, <HI>danced</HI> before it.—<HI>And, to mention but one Instance more, which may serve as a general Directory to us on</HI> this <HI>and such like Oc∣casions; When the great Head of the Church, had rescued his People from the general Mas∣sacre intended to be executed upon them by a

cruel and ambitious</HI> Haman, <HI>Mordecai</HI> sent <Q>Let∣ters unto all the <HI>Jews</HI> that were in all the Pro∣vinces of the King <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> both nigh and far, to establish among them, that they should keep the Fourteenth Day of the Month <HI>Adar,</HI> and the <HI>Fifteenth</HI> Day of the same yearly, as the Days wherein the <HI>Jews</HI> rested from their Enemies, and the Month which was turned un∣to them from <HI>Sorrow</HI> unto <HI>Joy,</HI> and from <HI>Mourning</HI> into a good Day: That they should make them Days of Feasting and Joy, <HI>and of</HI> sending Portions one to another, and Gifts to the Poor?</Q> And why should not <HI>we</HI> go and do likewise?</P>
<P>And shall we forget, on such an Occasion, to express our Gratitude to, and make honourable mention of, those <HI>Worthies,</HI> who have signaliz'd themselves, and been ready to sacrifice both Lives and Fortunes at this critical Juncture?— This would be to act the Part of those un∣grateful <HI>Israelites,</HI> who are branded in the Book of GOD, for not shewing Kindness <Q><HI>to the House of</HI> Jerubbaal, <HI>a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ely</HI> Gideon, <HI>according to all the Goodness which he shewed unto</HI> Israel.</Q> Even a <HI>Pharoah</HI> could prefer a deserving <HI>Joseph, Ahasuerus</HI> a <HI>Mordecai,</HI> and <HI>Nebuchadnezar</HI> a <HI>Daniel,</HI> when made Instruments of signal Ser∣vice to themselves and People.—<Q>My Heart, <HI>says Deborah,</HI> is towards (i. e. <HI>I have a particular Veneration and Regard for)</HI> the Governors of <HI>Israel,</HI> that offered themselves willingly.—And

Blessed, <HI>adds she,</HI> above Women shall <HI>Jael</HI> the Wife of <HI>Heber</HI> the Kenite be: For she put her Hand to the Nail, and her right Hand to the Workman's Hammer, and with the Ham∣mer she smote <HI>Sisera,</HI> she smote off his Head, when she had pierced and stricken thro' his Temples.</Q> And shall not we say, "Blessed, above Men, let His Royal Highness the DUKE OF CUMBERLAND be: For, thro' his instrumen∣tality, the great and glorious JEHOVAH hath brought <HI>mighty Things</HI> to pass?"—Should not our Hearts be towards the worthy <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> the <HI>Royal Hunters,</HI> and those other <HI>Eng∣lish Heroes,</HI> who <HI>offered themselves so willingly?</HI> —Let the Names of BLAKENEY, BLAND and REA, and all those who waxed valiant in Fight, on this important Occasion, live for ever in the <HI>British</HI> Annals. —Let that worthy Clergy∣man who endured <HI>Five hundred</HI> Lashes from the cruel Enemy, (every one of which the gene∣rous DUKE said, he <HI>felt himself</HI>) be never for∣gotten by the Ministers of CHRIST in parti∣cular......And let the Name of that great that incomparably brave Soldier of the KING, and good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, Colonel GARDINER, (excuse me if I here vent a Sigh, —He was my intimate Friend) let his Name, I say, be had in everlasting Remembrance— His Majesty has led us an Example of Grati∣tude Acting like himself, upon the first News of this brave Man's Death, he sent immediate

Orders that his Family should be taken Care of.—The noble DUKE gave a Commission im∣mediately to his eldest Son.—And the sympa∣thizing <HI>Prince of Hesse</HI> paid a Visit of Condo∣lance to his sorrowful elect and worthy Lady— The <HI>British</HI> Parliament have made a publick Acknowledgement of the Obligation the Na∣tion lies under to His Royal Highness.—And surely the least we can do, is to make a pub∣lick and grateful Mention of their Names, to whom under God, we owe so much <HI>Gratitude</HI> and <HI>Thanks.</HI> —</P>
<P>But, after all, is there not an infinitely greater Debt of <HI>Gratitude</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI> due from <HI>us,</HI> on this <HI>Occasion,</HI> to him that is Higher than the Highest, even the KING of KINGS and LORD of LORDS, the Blessed and only PO∣TENTATE?

<P>But shall we put off our good and gracious Be∣nefactor, with a mere Lip-Service? GOD forbid.

—Your <HI>worthy</HI> GOVERNOR has honoured GOD in his late <HI>excellent Proclamation,</HI> and GOD will honour him—But shall our <HI>Thanks</HI> ter∣minate with the Day?—No, in no wise—Our Text reminds us of a <HI>more noble Sacrifice,</HI> and points out to us the great End the Almighty JEHOVAH proposes, in bestowing such sig∣nal Favours upon a People, viz. <HI>That they should observe his Statutes and keep his Laws.</HI>.....</P>
<P>This is the Return we are all taught to pray that we may make to the most High GOD, the Father of Mercies, in the daily Office of our Church, viz. <Q>That our Hearts may be unfeign∣edly Thankful, and that we may shew forth his Praise, not only with our Lips but in our <HI>Lives,</HI> by giving up our selves to his Service, and by walking before him in Holiness and Righteous∣ness all our Days.</Q>—Oh that these Words were the real Language of all that use them! Oh that there was in us such a Mind!—How soon would our Enemies then flee before us, and GOD, even our own GOD, yet give us more abundant Blessings!—</P>
<P>And, why should we not <HI>observe GOD's Sta∣tutes and keep his Laws?</HI>—Dare any say that any of his Commands are grievous?—Is not CHRIST's Yoak, to a renewed Soul, as far as renewed, <HI>easy</HI>; and his Burden comparatively <HI>light?</HI>—May I not appeal to the most <HI>refined Reasoner,</HI> whether the Religion of JESUS CHRIST be not a social Religion?—Whether

From what Fountain do all those Evils, which the present and past Ages have groaned under, flow, but from a Neglect of the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Statutes</HI> of our great and all-wise Law-giver JESUS of <HI>Nazareth?</HI>—Tell me, ye Men of Letters, whether <HI>Lycurgus</HI> or <HI>Solon, Pythagoras</HI> or <HI>Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, Cicero,</HI> or all the ancient Law-givers and <HI>Heathen</HI> Moralists, put them alltoge∣ther, ever published a System of <HI>Ethicks,</HI> any way worthy to be compared with the glorious System laid down in that much despised Book, (to use Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI>'s Expression) <HI>emphati∣cally</HI> called <HI>the Scriptures?</HI> Is not the Divine Image, and Superscription written upon every Precept of the Gospel? Do they not shine with a native intrinsick Lustre? And, tho' many Things in them are <HI>above,</HI> yet, is there any thing <HI>contrary</HI> to the strictest Laws of right Reason?—Is not JESUS CHRIST, in Scrip∣ture, stiled the Word, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the Reason? And is not his Service justly stiled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a <HI>rea∣sonable Service</HI>?—What if there be <HI>Mysteries</HI> in his Religion?—Are they not without all Controversy great and glorious?—Are they not Mysteries of

Godliness, and worthy <HI>that</HI> GOD who reveals them?—Nay, is it not the greatest Mystery that Men who pretend to Reason, and call them∣selves <HI>Philosophers,</HI> who search into the <HI>Arcana Naturae,</HI> and consequently find a Mystery in every Blade of Grass, should yet be so irratio∣nal as to decry all Mysteries in Religion?— Where is the <HI>Scribe</HI>? Where is the <HI>Wise</HI>? Where is the <HI>Disputer</HI> against the <HI>Christian Re∣velation?</HI>—Does not every thing without and within us conspire to prove its divine Original? And would not Self-Interest, if there was no other Motive, excite us to <HI>observe</HI> GOD's <HI>Statutes and keep his Laws?</HI></P>
<P>Besides, considered as a Protestant People, do we not lie under the greatest Obligations of any Nation under Heaven, to pay a <HI>chearful, unanimous, universal, persevering</HI> OBEDIENCE to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ine Commands?</HI></P>
<P>The wonderful and surprizing Manner of GOD's bringing about a Reformation, in the Reign of King HENRY the <HI>Eighth</HI>—His car∣rying it on in the blessed Reign of King ED∣WARD the <HI>Sixth</HI>— His delivering us out of the Bloody Hands of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and de∣stroying the <HI>Spanish invincible Armada,</HI> under her immediate Protestant Successor Queen ELIZABETH—His Discovery of the <HI>Popish Plot</HI> under King JAMES—The <HI>glorious Revolution</HI> by King WILLIAM—And, to come nearer to our own Times, His driving away <HI>four Thousand

<P>Need I remind you further, in order to <HI>excite</HI> in you a greater <HI>Diligence</HI> to <HI>comply</HI> with the Intent of the Text, that tho' the Storm, in a great Measure is <HI>abated</HI> by his <HI>Royal High∣ness's</HI> late <HI>Success,</HI> yet we dare not say, <HI>it is altogether blown over?</HI></P>
<P>The Clouds may again return after the Rain; and the few surviving Rebels (which I pray God avert) may yet be suffered to make Head against <HI>us</HI>—We are still engaged in a <HI>bloody,</HI> and in all probability, a <HI>tedious</HI> War, with two of the most <HI>inveterate Enemies</HI> to the Interests of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>—And, tho' I cannot help thinking, that their present <HI>Intentions</HI> are so <HI>Iniquitous,</HI> their Conduct so <HI>perfidious,</HI> and their

However this is <HI>certain,</HI> the Rod is yet hanging over us;— And, I believe it will be granted, on all sides, that if such various Dispensations of Mercy and Judgment, do not <HI>teach the Inhabitants of any Land to learn Righteousness,</HI> they will only ripen them for a greater Ruin— Give me leave, therefore, to dismiss you at this Time with that solemn <HI>awful</HI> Warning and Exhortati∣on
