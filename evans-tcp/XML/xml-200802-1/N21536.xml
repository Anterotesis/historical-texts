<HEAD>TO THE PROFESSORS OF THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF MEDICAL SCIENCE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LONG have you been my <HI>fathers</HI> and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my attentive <HI>pre∣ceptors,</HI> in the interesting science of medicine. You justly hold on me, therefore, a twofold claim for the twofold duty of a pupil and a son. In respectful acknowledge∣ment of this undeniable claim, I now step forward and thus publicly solicit your acceptance of the <HI>first fruits</HI> of that medical education, which you yourselves were pleased
<PB N="vi" REF="028310_0004_0FD8800C811311F8"/>
to patronize and direct with such ability and care.</P>
<P>Avowedly to solicit an extension of your immediate patronage and protection to the following trans∣lation, would be to offer you an indignity little short of actual in∣sult. Such a solicitation would falsely represent you as men un∣willing to become the spontaneous guardians and friends of silent, unassuming truth and merit, but standing with open arms for the reception even of intrusive error itself, when ushered to your notice by a brazen front and a blanditious tongue.</P>
<P>The original work of Professor Blumenbach has been already sanc∣tioned
<PB N="vii" REF="028310_0005_0FD896327B91ADF8"/>
by the applauding voice of the learned and the ingenious in almost every part of the globe to which physical science has hitherto found its way. On the solitary basis of its own intrinsic merit let my <HI>translation</HI> also stand; or if, indeed, it be destitute of such basis, with disgrace let it sink into that sea of oblivion which so justly awaits its final reception.</P>
<P>From you, Gentlemen, it is se∣cure of at least, a patient, and, I flatter myself, an impartial exami∣nation. Should the execution of the work fortunately meet with your approbation and applause, you will be its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uspicious announ∣cers to the medical public: but should it appear to you faulty and
<PB N="viii" REF="028310_0006_0FD89634D253AE50"/>
even wholly unworthy of further attention or regard, you will not, I am sure, lose sight of that fa∣vourite maxim of the humane and generous bosom, "<HI>primum pecca∣tum veniandum est."</HI></P>
<P>Impressed with the most pro∣found sentiments of esteem and gratitude for your favours of a public nature, as well as for your attentive acts of private friendship, I have the honour to be,</P>

<HEAD>Preface by the Translator.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a fashionable letter of in∣troduction is to its bearer, a fashionable pre∣face is to the literary performance which it openly announces to the world. The former procures, for the most part, admission, and, at least, a dinner; the latter most commonly an attentive perusal. For their future conti∣nuance, however, in favour and esteem, both the visitant and the volume must depend on something more substantial, and of more un∣equivocal utility, than either the light eti∣quette of a letter, or the specious proposals of a recommendatory preface.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="028310_0008_0FD89637BA9D6EA0"/>The reader is requested to view the pre∣sent prefatory address as a mere peace-offering, made by the translator to ancient and invete∣rate custom, and not as a solemn appeal to the public designed to enhance either the <HI>merit</HI> of the following <HI>performance,</HI> or the <HI>uprightness</HI> of the <HI>motives</HI> which led to its execution. For with regard to the <HI>merit</HI> of the work, I flatter myself that no character of literature and ta∣lents will ever resign his right of judging for himself; and as to the <HI>motives</HI> by which I was induced to engage in its translation, they are indeed at present nothing better than ab∣solute non-entities, and will in no way effect its utility to man.</P>
<P>The want of a new and complete system of physiology has been long and very sensi∣bly experienced and regretted by all medical students on this side the Atlantic. As to myself, I am sure I was led most devoutly to
<PB N="xi" REF="028310_0009_0FD8963951C15D48"/>
regret such a want, throughout every stage of my medical studies. In order to acquire a knowledge of the improvements which had lately taken place in this important branch of physical science, I was obliged to range with an infinitude of labour and attention, through daily accumulating volumes, which it was sometimes extremely difficult to pro∣cure. This difficulty was augmented even to impossibility itself with those unfor∣tunately living out of the sphere of public libraries.</P>
<P>The mutilated abridgment of Haller's physiology, published in the English lan∣guage, is (to use a common mode of expres∣sion) certainly nothing more than a <HI>bare apo∣logy</HI> for a system. It is imperfect, erro∣neous, and, in many places, to me wholly unintelligible. In some parts, therefore, it no doubt inculcates truth, in others implants
<PB N="xii" REF="028310_0010_0FD8963AB8E94E30"/>
the seeds of error, and in other places again leaves the young mind at liberty to indulge itself in all the wildness and revelry of con∣jecture.</P>
<P>For these deficiencies and faults. I am sure that at least some compensation is made, and some degree of remedy provided in the fol∣lowing sheets, which I am about to usher forth to the world. But on this subject let decision be awarded, and judgment pro∣nounced, by the candid and intelligent rea∣der, and not by</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. OF THE LIVING HUMAN BODY IN GENERAL.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 1.</HEAD>
<P>IN the living human body, the healthy functions of which constitute the exclusive object of the science of Physiology, there occur three things worthy of our immediate attention and regard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In an ancient volume commonly ranked among the wri∣tings of Hippocrates, <HI>Epidemic.</HI> VI. Sect. 8. § 19, we find the following remarkable clause:
<Q>Quae continent corpora, aut intus continentur, aut in nobis cum impetu moventur contemplanda sunt.</Q>
This celebrated clause furnished Abr. Kaau Boerhaave with the first hints and suggestions on the subject of his inestimable work entitled,
<Q>Impetum faciens dictum Hippocrati per corpus consentiens.</Q>
L. B. 1745-8.</NOTE>; namely,</P>
<P>The <HI>Solids,</HI> or parts containing;</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="028310_0016_0FD896453B4BAC18"/>The <HI>Fluids,</HI> or parts contained within the solids;</P>
<P>And lastly, the <HI>Vital Energies,</HI> which in the consideration of the science of physiology, consti∣tute the most interesting and important object of our regard. It is in consequence of these energies that the solids are rendered alive to the impulse of the fluids, endued with a power to propel the same, and also to perform a variety of other motions. It must however be observed, that these energies are not incommunicably excluded even from some of the fluids themselves: on the whole, they ap∣pear to constitute the essence or supreme charac∣teristic of an organised body.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 2.</HEAD>
<P>But although these three <HI>objects</HI> have been with propriety considered as distinct from each other, and may therefore be separately enumerated on the present occasion, they are notwithstanding in the living body, which is alone the exclusive sub∣ject of physiology, so intimately connected toge∣ther, that it is scarcely possible to form even a conception of one without at the same time em∣bracing the others.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="028310_0017_0FD89646B8CDA810"/>The most pure and limpid fluids of our body abound with animal earth: on the other hand, though our solids may appear to us completely destitute of liquid matter, yet, besides the circum∣stance of their originating from the fluids as their <HI>matrix</HI> or primary source, they contain in their composition an evident quantity of moisture▪ lastly, if we be not deceived, it is certainly true that there exists scarcely a fibril in the living body which does not possess, in a higher or lower degree, a vital energy inherent in itself.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 3.</HEAD>
<P>We now proceed to treat of each of those three objects separately and in order: and fir st of the fluids; as constituting by far the <HI>greatest,</HI> and what may be emphatically called the <HI>first-born</HI> part of our bodies.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II. OF THE FLUIDS OF THE HUMAN BODY IN GENERAL, AND OF THE BLOOD IN PARTICULAR.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 4.</HEAD>
<P>All the different fluids of our body, may with propriety be thrown into three leading classes.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028310_0018_0FD896485079B278"/>These are, I. The <HI>Crude</HI> or unassimilised fluid, consisting chiefly of the chyle contained in the primae viae, and destined for conversion into blood; to which may also be added, <HI>that fluid</HI> received by absorption from the external superficies of the body, and conveyed to the same receptacle with the former.</P>
<P N="2">II. The blood itself;</P>
<P>And Lastly, the <HI>secreted fluid,</HI> or that formed from the volume of blood by the animal process, called secretion: the fluids prepared by this pro∣cess are destined, some of them, to be retained in our body, to serve further purposes in the animal economy; and others, to be eliminated from our system, as wholly excrementitious.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 5.</HEAD>
<P>Of the first and third of those classes we will speak on a future occasion, when we come to treat of chylification, and of secretion, together with the other functions to which those fluids are respec∣tively related. Let us now proceed to the consi∣deration of the blood, that most important, that primary, and truly vital liquid, which may with the greatest propriety be called, the living fountain of all the other fluids; as being that <HI>into</HI> which the crude fluid is converted; and <HI>from</HI> which all
<PB N="5" REF="028310_0019_0FD8964A94CC3030"/>
the secreted fluids derive their origin; and which (a few parts of the body excepted, such as the epidermis, the <HI>tunica arachnoidea,</HI> the amnion, the vitreous substance, or enamel, of the teeth, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws uniformly through every even the most minute and fine span parts of the inexplicable texture of our system.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 6.</HEAD>
<P>The blood is a liquid <HI>sui generis,</HI> of a well known colour, more or less intense: it is glutin∣ous and warm to the touch: the formation of this liquid has hitherto been ranked among the <HI>arcana</HI> of nature, as it has never been successfully imi∣tated by any process of art.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 7.</HEAD>
<P>This vital liquid when recently drawn from a living subject, and received into a vessel, exhibits in a very obvious manner the following remark∣able phenomena:</P>
<P>In the first place, while it is yet warm, a subtle halitus ascends from it, which being collected in a receiver, forms small pellucid globules, similar in appearance to drops of dew; it is of an aqueous nature, resembling not a little common fountain water, except that it emits a peculiar nidorous smell, (still more considerable in the blood of car∣nivorous
<PB N="6" REF="028310_0020_0FD8964C05AFF690"/>
animals) and which may be aptly called the <HI>animal odour;</HI> such, for example, as arises from fresh urine, or from the thoracic and abdo∣minal cavities of a dead subject recently opened. Of this aqueous liquor a considerable quantity re∣mains in a state of mixture with the other consti∣tuent parts of the blood, which shall be hereafter mentioned.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 8.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean while, as the blood contained in the vessel suffers a gradual reduction of tempera∣ture, it begins to separate into two parts. A coagulum is first formed, from the superficies and sides of which, there presently exsudes a liquor of an intermediate shade between pale yellow, and evanescent red, which they call the <HI>serum</HI> of the blood; in proportion as this liquor accumu∣lates by exsu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, a corresponding diminution is observable in the volume of the coagulum itself; the coagulum thus reduced in size has been dis∣tinguished by the name of <HI>crassamentum,</HI> as also by those of the <HI>liver,</HI> and <HI>placenta</HI> of the blood, from a resemblance, in point of colour and fran∣gibility of texture supposed to exist between it and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese two bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s; it has been likewise called <HI>the island,</HI> from the circumstance of its being held in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tant or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing state in the surrounding serum.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="part">
<PB N="7" REF="028310_0021_0FD8964D9A929CC0"/>
<HEAD>§ 9.</HEAD>
<P>This crassamentum itself, by a delicate treatment, such as gentle agitation or frequent ablutions in water, may be again separated into two constituent parts, viz. the <HI>cruor,</HI> which imparts the red co∣lour to the whole mass of blood, and which by ablution is carried off from the <HI>lymph,</HI> the other and more substantial part, and which, therefore, is called the basis of the crassamentum; that the cruor retains for this basis a much stronger af∣finity than the serum possesses, is sufficiently ob∣vious from this circumstance, that the cruor and basis cannot be disparted unless by the interpo∣sition of a certain degree of force. The lymph itself being robbed of the cruor, becomes more and more pale until it finally assumes the appearance of a white and considerably tenaceous coagulum.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 10.</HEAD>
<P>Such then appears to be the four principal con∣stituent parts of the blood,—viz. the watery <HI>halitus;</HI> the <HI>serum;</HI> the <HI>cruor,</HI> or red globules; and the coagulable <HI>lymph;</HI> which several parts, as long as they retain their native degree of viral temperature, continue in a state of the most equable mixture, constituting an uniform and homogeneous fluid.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="028310_0022_0FD8964EFB604970"/>It will now be proper to enter into a more mi∣nute consideration of those three portions of the blood which stand last in the above enumeration: As to the aqueous exhalation which we have men∣tioned, it does not appear of sufficient importance to claim any further attention; indeed as it is also discovered in other parts of the body, it cannot be considered as proper to the blood alone, any more than the air which this vital fluid contains, and on which we will state a few observations in a subsequent part of this section.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 11.</HEAD>
<P>The serum is a liquid of such a gelatinous nature as to impart to the whole mass of the blood the chief part of its viscosity or gluey consistence: it very much resembles, in all its properties, the al∣bumen or white of eggs; when subjected to the action of a temperature equal to the 150th degree on the scale of Fahrenheit's thermometer, it pas∣ses into a coagulum, white and easily broken down, analogous to the white of eggs in a boiled state; it also suffers a similar change, according to the experiments of the celebrated Moscati, if it be mixed with a quantity of quick lime, though in this case the coagulation proceeds much more slowly, and is not completed till after the twen∣tieth hour. But if the serum be dried with a gentle heat, and left wholly undisturbed, it is
<PB N="9" REF="028310_0023_0FD896514D56B410"/>
converted into a firm pellucid mass, similar in its external appearance to gum arabic, which in a gradual manner, like the dried white of eggs, cracks and forms over its surface numerous <HI>sulci</HI> or fissures running in a somewhat spiral direction, and exhibiting a very singular appearance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="12" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 12.</HEAD>
<P>Besides those other properties of the serum already mentioned, there is one highly worthy our consideration, to which my attention was first called by the experiments of the illustrious Priestley <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philos. Transact. vol. LXVI. P. I. pag. 244, seq.</NOTE>; but my belief of which has since been fully confirmed by repeated observations of my own, viz. the facility with which the air, sur∣rounding a vessel filled with blood, is able to act through the medium of the serum or the crassa∣mentum, though deeply covered by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormer, in such a manner as to produce a very remarkable change in the colour of the latter, whereas, on the other hand, the same action of the air would be very much impeded, if not entirely prevented, if instead of the serum, the crassamentum were covered with any foreign liquid, such as water, or oil, &amp;c. or even with any other fluid of the human body itself, as the saliva or urine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="13" TYPE="part">
<PB N="10" REF="028310_0024_0FD89652FABD23D0"/>
<HEAD>§ 13.</HEAD>
<P>The cruor constitutes another very striking and important part of the blood, and is a source of many singularities, whether we consider the colour and figure of its particles, or the elemen∣tary parts into which it is resolved when subjected to the action of and intense heat. It appears to deserve a place among the most elaborate juices of the body, as it seldom appears in the tender foetus previously to the fourth week after concep∣tion, nor in the nascent young of gallinaceous fowls till the fortieth hour of incubation. After profuse hemorrhages it likewise appears to be re∣placed by the powers of the system, with much more difficulty than the other constituent portions of the blood.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="14" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 14.</HEAD>
<P>It consists of globules, first observed by Leeu∣wenhoek. In blood recently drawn they are al∣ways present, of a constant, uniform figure, and of an equable magnitude; which circumstances, added to the further consideration, that in no other fluid (milk alone excepted, the particles of which are somewhat analogous), are similar bodies to be met with, leave not a shadow of doubt, but that those globules form a part very obviously and essentially different from the other constituent portions of the blood, though at the
<PB N="11" REF="028310_0025_0FD8965439DD6A60"/>
same time the formation of those globular bodies themselves appears in reality to be much more simple than some celebrated characters would in∣duce us to believe. For to pass over in silence the complexity of the sixfold form fictitiously be∣stowed on them by Leeuwenhoek, neither the an∣nular figure attributed to them by the illustrious de la Torre, nor the form of vesicles enclosing an opaque nucleous, such as Hewson apprehended he discovered in them, have appeared to me to be well founded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philos. Trans. Vol. LXIII. P. II. p. 303. seq. tab. XII.</NOTE>. In my observations, indeed, I have been able to detect nothing more than bodies of a simple spherical appearance, and, if I am not deceived, of a solid gelatinous confidence. I have not, indeed, absolutely denied the lenticular figure bestowed on them by some observers: I dare not, however, venture to assert, that I have been so fortunate as to observe it.</P>
<P>It has been a subject of controversy whether or not they can alter their figure when it becomes necessary for them to pass through a vessel of a very narrow diameter. I am inclined to believe, in conformity to the opinion of that accurate observer Reichel that under the above circum∣stances, they do actually change their spherical for an oval figure, and again resume their former

globular shape, when they advance into vessels sufficiently capacious; though I must confess, I never had the happiness to be a spectator of this interesting phenomenon.</P>
<P>This spherical figure of the globules is never perceived unless in the blood circulating in the vessels of a living animal, or in that which is re∣cently drawn; they lose all regularity of form in process of time, and appear to dissolve, as it were, and again unite with each other into one uniform shapeless mass.</P>

<P>Their colour is red, and therefore the beautiful crimson cast of the whole mass of blood appears to be evidently derived from them. The intensity of this colour changes with a multiplicity of vary∣ing circumstances; it is more pale in animals which are too sparingly nourished, or in such as have suffered profuse hemorrhages. The blood con∣tained

in the arteries is more florid, together with that which has been subjected to the action of <HI>atmospheric,</HI> but more especially, that which has been exposed to <HI>dephlogisticated</HI> air; while venous blood is more obscure, as well as that which has been acted on by fixed or inflammable air.</P>

<DIV3 N="17" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 17.</HEAD>
<P>Upon the whole, the causes, which augment the quantity of the red globules in general, and also heighten the intensity of their colour, are sufficiently evident: but to discover from what secret source their disposition to this crimson dye is originally derived, is a matter of Herculean difficulty indeed. Haller ascribed it to the pre∣sence of <HI>crocus martis,</HI> because the blood abounds more with iron than the bones, or other parts of the body, although the quantity contained, even in the blood itself, is very small; and although authors differ astonishingly in their attempts to ascertain it. Thus, for instance, Menghinus esti∣mated its relative proportion to the whole mass of the blood, to be as 1 to 110; whereas, the illus∣trious Rhades calculated it to be only as 1 to 427; and again, in some future experiments, to be no more than as 1 to 503, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the present subject it seems proper to make the following observation; viz. that no iron can
<PB N="14" REF="028310_0028_0FD89658B8B27B08"/>
be discovered in the cruor of the blood unless it be previously calcined; whereas, on the other hand, when it was dried with a gentle heat, and reduced to the most impalpable powder, I could not observe a single particle of it attracted by the magnet, whether the experiment was made in water, or in that most fluid of all vehicles, quick∣silver.</P>

<P>We now come to the consideration of that con∣stituent part of the mass of blood, which stands last in our order of enumeration, viz. the <HI>Lymph;</HI> which is by some called the basis of the crassamen∣tum, by others, the mucous or glutinous part, and by others, the fibrous portion of the blood.</P>
<P>This, in former times, was very erroneously confounded with the serum, from which it is not∣withstanding very widely different, in all its essen∣tial properties. When the lymph is exposed to the action of air, especially of such as is of a low tem∣perature, it is immediately coagulated; but by the admixture of quicklime, (which has been already said (§ 11.) to have the power of coagulating serum), it is preserved in a fluid state; or, even though it be already coagulated, yet, by the addition of this substance, it is again immediately resolved.</P>

<DIV3 N="19" TYPE="part">

<P>We have already touched on the methods, by which this part of the blood may be separated from the cruor (§ 9.). It is also by other artifi∣cial methods, such as whipping or agitating the blood with small twigs, induced to assume the appearance of a membrane, which has been named after Ruysch its celebrated discoverer.</P>
<P>The similitude which prevails between the mem∣brane thus formed by art, and certain remarkable phenomena in diseases, especially in those of an inflammatory nature, reduces it to a certainty, that such phenomena are to be entirely referred to the coagulation of the lymph, of which we are now treating.</P>
<P>It may be proper on the present occasion to mention a few of those numerous phenomena al∣luded to, which evidently derive their origin from this property of the lymph; thus we may instance in particular, the <HI>pleuritic crust,</HI> which is formed on the surface of the crassamentum of blood re∣ceived into a vessel and suffered to remain some∣time at rest; the <HI>membrane-like</HI> appearances which usually transude from, and completely invest the surfaces of the several viscera when in a state of inflammation; and also the <HI>membrana caduca</HI>

of Hunter, which exsudes from the cavity of the uterus, when impregnated, and still under the gentle glow of the venereal orgasm. From the same source originates likewise, that production of cellular membrane by which we see frequently the lungs connected to the pleura in cases of peripneu∣mony; as also the preternatural portions of the same substance often found in the cavity of the abdomen after profuse hemorrhages; and finally, to no other source can we rationally refer those membrane-like productions, which, in that singular species of disease, vulgarly denominated Lithopoedion, firmly attach to the contiguous viscera such parts as are irritated to inflamation by the too long re∣tention of the calculus or stone in the abdominal cavity. It seems to be also an opinion founded at least on probability, that polypi, and such like preternatural coagulated excrescences, owe their existence to the same cause.</P>

<P>Those phenomena just enumerated, together with a variety of others which every where occur, demonstrate, in a most striking manner, the superior importance of this lymphatic portion, in which the vital principle of the blood appears immedi∣ately to reside, if indeed the blood possess any such principle, an opinion which I think both ingeni∣ous and highly probable.</P>

<P>Besides those general portions of the blood al∣ready enumerated, we have on a former occasion observed that this fluid contains also, in a state of mixture, other elementary principles. (§ 10.)</P>
<P>What I principally advert to at present is <HI>air,</HI> which is commonly believed to constitute 1/11 part of the whole mass of blood, but which in the blood of a living and healthy subject does not exist in a free and perfectly elastic state, but is so intimately united and involved, and so permanent∣ly fixed, as to be with difficulty extricated and restored to its native aeriform state. Indeed I have learned from actual experiments, that even a very small quantity of the most pure air injected through an artificial opening into the jugular vein of a dog, has excited symptoms of a very formida∣ble nature, such as palpitations of the heart, drowsi∣ness, convulsions, and, when the quantity was slight∣ly increased, even death itself quickly succeeded.</P>

<P>THE solids of the body are originally derived from the fluids themselves; thus in the first rudiments of the embryo, while yet in a gela∣tinous state, the solids, each in its own appropriate situation, begin in a very gradual manner to as∣sume their proper form and texture, infinitely dif∣ferent from each other in point of cohesion, from the most tender and almost pultaceous consistence, such as the medullary substance of the brain, to the most firm and durable, as the vitreous cortex, or enamel of the teeth.</P>

<P>A great portion of the solids of our body very evidently exhibits a fibrous texture, composed of small filaments running more or less parallel to each other.

<P>In various <HI>other parts</HI> of the animal body, the texture is so widely different from that of which we have just spoken, that in them it is scarcely possible to trace the appearance of a single fibre; their structure is indeed of a very singular and spe∣cific nature, distinguished in Greek by the name <HI>parenchyma.</HI> This parenchymatous substance is almost exclusively confined to some of the secreting

<P>Through all those varieties of composition and texture, whether of a fibrous or parenchymatous appearance, there is interwoven, in common, more or less of a certain web like substance, which is called <HI>cellular membrane,</HI> and which deserves a place among the primary, the most important and essential, constituent parts of our system.</P>

<P>For, in the first place, there are several of the solid parts of the human body, which appear to consist of little else than cellular membrane, in a constipated or compacted state; of this description are most of the membranes and cartilages; which, by long maceration, may be again resolved into a cellular web, of more or less laxity. It is, again, so intimately and minutely interwoven in the com∣position of other parts, as to serve the important purposes of a receptacle and basis to the other portions of substance which assist in their formation. Thus, for instance, the hardest bones made their first appearance in the tenderer state of cartilage, which, as already observed, is nothing more than condensed cellular membrane: this cellular mem∣brane, yet in a lax condition, became afterwards
<PB N="22" REF="028310_0036_0FD89665D7D67E48"/>
distended, and at length completely saturated, as it were, by the constant accession of osseous matter, till it finally assumed the nature and appearance of perfect bone. Indeed it would appear, that none of the solids of our body exist, without containing more or less of this web-like substance in their composition, if we except the enamel of the teeth, in which I was not able to discover the smallest por∣tion of cellular substance, even when the enamel was subjected to the action of one of the stronger acids.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="30" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 30.</HEAD>
<P>This cellular substance, which serves the great purpose of a boundary, or partition-wall, to adja∣cent parts, is especially interwoven in, as well as spread between, muscles and membranes. To other parts, again, particularly to vessels and nerves, it answers as a bed or basis of support. Finally, it constitutes one common and general bond of union, which connects the neighbouring individual parts to each other, and establishes between the whole an extensive medium of communication.</P>

<DIV3 N="31" TYPE="part">

<P>From what has been already said, two conclu∣sions naturally present themselves.</P>
<P>First, in as much as it appears, that the cel∣lular membrane certainly constitutes the ground∣work
<PB N="23" REF="028310_0037_0FD89666F98ECD60"/>
of the structure of the whole body, if we figure to ourselves the entire removal of every other substance which enters into, and assists in completing, the composition of the system, the cellular membrane, still remaining in its proper situation, unmolested and alone, will nevertheless preserve and exhibit the complete figure of the whole and every part of the body.</P>
<P>Secondly, as by means of this cellular founda∣tion, a certain connection and medium of commu∣nication are formed, between all the parts of the body, however widely different from each other they may be, in nature, or remote, in situation; the knowledge of this fact serves an important end, not only in deciding controversies which respect the continuation of membranes, but also in explain∣ing many phenomena of diseases which daily pre∣sent themselves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="32" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 32.</HEAD>
<P>As the cellular membrane appears thus to afford origin and foundation to most of the solid parts of the body, so it appears itself to owe its own exis∣tence to the lymphatic part of the blood, of which we have already spoken. I am induced to enter∣tain this opinion from having seen the lymph, after transuding from the lungs of pleuritic patients, converted by the powers of the animal economy
<PB N="24" REF="028310_0038_0FD8966879803AE8"/>
into real cellular substance, which afterwards assuming the appearance of more compacted mem∣branes, oftentimes attaches those viscera to the surrounding pleura.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="33" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 33.</HEAD>
<P>What has been already advanced on the subject, may be sufficient to show the general nature, and establish the importance, of the cellular membrane. We will now proceed to consider some of its varieties.</P>
<P>And, in the first place, its firmness is not always uniform.</P>
<P>For, in general, other circumstances being alike, the cellular membrane of the human body is very tender indeed, when compared with that of other animals. If I am not deceived, this very softness and pliancy of the cellular substance in the human system, deserves to be ranked among the leading prerogatives of man; because, in consequence of it, his susceptibility of impressions from the more refined and subtle stimuli is greatly increased, as well as his capacity to perform motions and vari∣ous functions, with facility and perfection.</P>
<P>But with regard to the more lax or firm texture of the cellular membrane, even among mankind
<PB N="25" REF="028310_0039_0FD89669F8A08178"/>
themselves, a very great variety occurs, depend∣ing on age, sex, mode of life, climate, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Finally, the condition of this membrane as to density and firmness, is various, as it is found existing in different parts of the same body: thus, it is more lax on the eye-lids and prepuce, more compact and firm about the ears, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="34" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 34.</HEAD>
<P>We now proceed to consider another use or office of the cellular membrane, besides that which we have already said it performs to the body in general, (§ 29, 30); namely, that by means of its numerous small cells, it affords con∣venient temporary receptacles for fluids of different kinds.</P>
<P>That fluid, which those minute cells are more particularly destined to receive, is a fine halitus of a serous nature, or a very subtle water, by which almost all parts of the body are moistened, and lubricated, and which this cellular web appears to absorb, after the manner of a sponge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it be admissible to designate by the name of <HI>vessels,</HI> those <HI>minute interstices</HI> of the cellular membrane, by which it absorbs fluids after the manner of a sponge, I readily acquiesce in the opinion of William Hunter, (see Medic. Obs. and Inquiries, vol. ii. p. 27. seq.) that this web-like expansion, now under immediate consideration, is composed of a congeries of vessels, in like manner with the other parts of the body. But if he entertained a belief, that this mem∣brane consists of small <HI>cylindrical veins,</HI> which anatomists commonly mean to represent by the term <HI>vessels,</HI> I must acknowledge, that microscopical observations, conducted with the utmost degree of minuteness, and the most cautious circumspection, have not been sufficient to furnish me with any unequivocal testimony that such vessels actually exist, but have rather induced me to embrace a contrary opinion.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="26" REF="028310_0040_0FD8966D7363AF78"/>
<HEAD>§ 35.</HEAD>
<P>But, besides this, the cellular membrane, in certain parts of the body, serves as a reservoir to humours of a different and somewhat specific na∣ture. Thus, that portion of it which constitutes the vitreous substance of the eye, is charged with a fluid of the same name:</P>
<P>That which forms the meddullary membrane of the bones (commonly, though improperly, cal∣led the internal periosteum) contains the medulla: and,</P>
<P>Finally, A large portion interwoven through the soft parts of the body, furnishes a convenient receptacle for the other portions of oily substance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="36" TYPE="part">
<PB N="27" REF="028310_0041_0FD8966E79805E10"/>
<HEAD>§ 36.</HEAD>
<P>And here indeed a threefold variety presents itself to our consideration:</P>
<P>There are, in the first place, certain parts of the body, the cellular substance of which, though of a very soft and extremely flaccid nature, is notwithstanding, never filled with fat in a healthy subject; such, for instance is that which lines the eyelids, and that spread on the genital organs of the male, &amp;c. But further, in numerous parts throughout the body, there are not unfrequently found irregular and transient collections of fat, which appear to reside in the same kind of cells, which at other times act as reservoirs to the atte∣nuated serous fluid already mentioned.</P>
<P>But finally, in certain parts of the body, and, unless I am deceived, in cells of a peculiar nature, and given description, fat is found constantly en∣closed, designed to subserve stated, uniform, and specific uses in the animal economy, such, for ex∣ample, is that which, in the female system, forms the <HI>mons veneris,</HI> which appears to me to consti∣tute a very peculiar and completely circumscribed protuberance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This circumstance I had an opportunity of ascertaining in a much more satisfactory manner in the dead body of a female ape. After having for some time subjected the corpse to the action of cold, I was able, by removing the skin, to expose entire the circumscribed globe of fat situated beneath the pubes.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="28" REF="028310_0042_0FD8966FFB452438"/>
<HEAD>§ 37.</HEAD>
<P>On the subject of the fat itself we will now pro∣ceed to make a few observations, the being so very proper a place for entering on the considera∣tion of it.</P>
<P>It is an oil, not unlike the unctuous oils of ve∣getables; bland, inodorous, and lighter than water, consisting of phlogiston, united to phlegm by means of an acid of a peculiar nature.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="38" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 38.</HEAD>
<P>It is formed at so late a period in the foetus, that scarcely an indubitable vestage of it can be discovered earlier than the fifth month after con∣ception.</P>
<P>Its consistence is various in different parts of the body. That for instance which lines the in∣side of the orbit of the eye, is more fluid, whilst that on the contrary which surrounds the kidneys approaches to the firmness and appearance of suet.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="39" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 39.</HEAD>
<P>A controversy has existed with respect to the <HI>secretion</HI> of the substance, namely, whether it is performed by a peculiar set of glandular bodies,
<PB N="29" REF="028310_0043_0FD896717A3DE598"/>
agreeably to the opinion of William Hunter, or whether it merely transudes, by simple diapedesis, through the patulous mouths of arteries? The latter of these opinions, besides other arguments which might be advanced in its favour, appears the most probable from hence, that not unfre∣quently preternatural collections of fat have been discovered in other parts than those commonly oc∣cupied by this substance: this circumstance can be much more aptly and rationally explained by at∣tributing such unusual collections of fat to an <HI>error∣loci,</HI> arising from a morbid state or disposition of the vessels, than by referring it to an unnatural and recently formed system of glands: thus for example, in the very ball of the eye itself, fat has been sometimes found; and a substance of a na∣ture like suet, usually fills up the cavity from which a testicle has been extracted; indeed there scarcely exists a cavity in the body in which stea∣tomatous collections have not made their appear∣ance.</P>
<P>But to conclude; those small glands to which certain celebrated characters have been solicitous to attribute the secretion of fat, appear as yet to be in reality nothing more than mere creatures of analogy.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="028310_0044_0FD89672F9369758"/>But however this may be determined, it is in the mean time very certain, that both the secre∣tion and absorption of this substance can be per∣formed with the utmost dispatch.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="40" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 40.</HEAD>
<P>The uses of the fat are numerous. It lubri∣cates the solids, and thus facilitates motion. It obviates and prevents a morbid excess of sensibi∣lity. It acts as a defence against cold: and, finally, by its uniform distention of the skin, con∣tributes to comeliness and beauty. Not to men∣tion the peculiar uses of the fatty matter con∣stantly bestowed on certain parts of the body, as the medulla of the bones, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. OF THE VITAL ENERGIES IN GENERAL, BUT PARTICULARLY OF CONTRACTILITY.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="41" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 41.</HEAD>
<P>WE enter now on the consideration of a difficult subject, namely, <HI>the living solid,</HI> and shall attempt a full account of the vital energies, by which the different parts of our body appear to be animated and fitted, as well to receive the impulse of stimuli, as to perform the various mo∣tions which are necessary in the economy of the living system.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="42" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 42.</HEAD>
<P>But with respect to the <HI>living solid,</HI> it will first be necessary to ascertain its exact limits, and to define it with precision and accuracy; whence it will evidently appear, that it is not our intention, on the present occasion, to treat either of <HI>those properties,</HI> which the human body possesses in common with numerous other bodies in nature, such as <HI>elasticity</HI> (the powers of which, however, are notwithstanding exhibited in various motions and functions of the animal economy), nor yet of <HI>those</HI> which reside exclusively in the <HI>mind</HI>; tho' we flatter ourselves no one will deny the powerful influence of these latter over the energies possess∣ed
<PB N="32" REF="028310_0046_0FD89676BAA08B80"/>
by the living solid itself, considered as a mate∣rial body. We will confine ourselves solely to the consideration of those energies which reside in our body as a system of organised matter, and which appear to be related to each other in the following order.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="43" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 43.</HEAD>
<P>The first and most universal species of those vi∣tal energies, and which may indeed be regarded as an inferior degree of the others, or rather as the threshold leading to them, is simple <HI>contractility,</HI> i. e. a propensity in a part to contract itself. As this property appears in reality to reside in every part of the cellular membrane, it must be equally exten∣sive with that membrane itself, and therefore may be said to pervade almost the whole body. Hence this may be called, with perhaps sufficient propri∣ety, the <HI>vis cellulosa.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="44" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 44.</HEAD>
<P>Another of the vital energies is, the <HI>irritability of Haller,</HI> which resides in muscular fibres only, and may therefore be called the <HI>vis muscularis.</HI> It manifests itself by a very singular, oscillatory and tremulous motion, easily distinguished from simple contraction, by its being more readily ex∣cited to action on the application of any acrid sti∣mulus.</P>

<DIV3 N="45" TYPE="part">
<PB N="33" REF="028310_0047_0FD8967838B60160"/>
<HEAD>§ 45.</HEAD>
<P>The third is <HI>sensibility,</HI> which resides solely in the nervous medulla, communicating with the sen∣sorium, called therefore <HI>vis nervea;</HI> when any part endowed with this property is acted on by irritating stimuli, an impression is immediately made on the sensorium.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="46" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 46.</HEAD>
<P>The three foregoing may be, with propriety, considered as <HI>common</HI> or <HI>general</HI> vital energies; because they exist, more or less, in almost all, or at least in a great many, parts of the body, which the ancients called therefore <HI>similares, i. e.</HI> parts of a similar nature.</P>

<DIV3 N="47" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 47.</HEAD>
<P>But besides the foregoing, there exists also a fourth energy worthy of our consideration, namely, the <HI>vita propria,</HI> or <HI>specific life;</HI> under which deno∣mination I mean to arrange such powers as belong to certain particular parts of the body, destined for the performance of peculiar functions, and which cannot with any propriety be referred to either of the classes of <HI>common energies,</HI> formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>Inferring synthetically, or <HI>a priori,</HI> as it is termed, it is not repugnant to sound induction to conclude, that parts differing from all others in

<P>But reasoning analytically, or <HI>a posteriori,</HI> we are likewise taught by accurate observations made on nature herself, that there are certain parts of the body, particularly some of the viscera, which perform motions so very singular, as cannot by any means be supposed to arise from either one or other of the common energies, of which we have already spoken, but must be referred to a <HI>vita propria,</HI> or specific energies of their own.</P>
<P>Instances of such sigularity of action we have in the motions of the iris; the erection of the papilla in the breasts of females; the motions of the fim∣bria; of the fallopian tubes; the action of the placenta; the action of the uterus in parturition; the descent of the testes in the male foetus; and, if I am not deceived, in a great part, if not in the whole of the process of secretion.</P>

<P><PB N="36" REF="028310_0050_0FD8967B3A2DF390"/>But with respect to <HI>contractility</HI> the present is a very suitable place to offer on it a few addi∣tional and particular observations.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="50" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 50.</HEAD>
<P>I have already said th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this energy pervades almost the whole body, at least, that its extent is commensurate with the extent of the cellular membrane.</P>
<P>In the first place, therefore, it resides in all such parts as consist of compared cellular sub∣stance, of which the different membranes of the body serve as examples. That these possess con∣tractility will not be denied by any one who re∣flects on the constriction of the <HI>dartos tunic,</HI> or who calls to mind the spasms of the skin, or of the peritoneum, which alone appears sometimes to incar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and strangle the intestines in cases of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Further, It also exists in such viscera as are composed chiefly of this kind of membrane; of this description are the lungs, the external super∣ficies of which is highly contractile, as I have lately learned from frequently puncturing and irri∣tating them in a living state; but I have not found them possessed of any real irritability, as has been lately asserted by Varnier.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="028310_0051_0FD8967CD7503F18"/>Even the bones themselves do not appear to be entirely destitute of contractility, as we learn, not only from the alveoli, which are well known to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>come narrower after the extraction or lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth, but also from the morbid affection term∣ed <HI>necrosis (i. e.</HI> mortification), from which it ap∣pears, that after a lifeless part of bone is quite re∣moved, the new production of bone, by which the vitiated part was before surrounded, contracts itself very gradually, almost to the natural thick∣ness and former figure of the part.</P>
<P>But as we observed on a former occasion, that the vitreous substance of the teeth was quite destitute of cellular membrane, so it appears to me probable, that it is entirely destitute of con∣tractility also, because when a part of it is either consumed by a caries, or broken off by accident, the remaining portions or sides are not approxi∣mated to each other, as we have already said takes place in the alveoli, but an irreparable hiatus or chasm continues without a shadow of diminution.</P>

<P>There further exists in the living system a won∣derful consent of parts, even the most remote; this consent is derived not from one, but seems to owe its origin to different sources.</P>

<P>Another source of this wonderful consent must be referred to the different vessels of the system, as well the sanguiferous as the lymphatic.</P>
<P>Another, again, arises from a certain similitude of structure, giving origin to what may be called a native sympathy.</P>
<P>The cellular membrane, which, as has been al∣ready observed, appears to constitute a common bond of union to the whole body, may be readily conceived to possess a very striking and powerful influence in promoting the consent of distant parts.</P>

<P>Finally, to this head belongs what is justly es∣teemed one of the greatest mysteries of nature, namely, the connection of the mind with the body, and the diversified and astonishing power of the one over the other.

the body, even without the concurrence or aid of the will.</P>
<P>Of this discription are those blind and purely animal instincts of our nature; such, for example, as that which excites to the gratification of vene∣real enjoyments.</P>
<P>Further, the body is greatly under the influence of the <HI>internal senses,</HI> more especially of the <HI>ima∣gination,</HI> and those passions of the mind which it contributes to excite.</P>

<P>The varieties in point of <HI>health</HI> are no less nu∣merous and considerable: there is indeed a cer∣tain state of health which may be said to be pecu∣liar to each individual. Such persons as we sup∣pose
<PB N="43" REF="028310_0057_0FD896867958EC68"/>
to be in the enjoyment of the most complete health, differ, notwithstanding surprisingly from each other, as well in consequence of a difference in the constitution of the blood, as of a diversity of tone, and of the other vital energies; hence different individuals are so differently affected by the same stimuli acting on their bodies. Perhaps each individual may possess peculiar idiosyncra∣sies, though so very inconsiderable as to be scarce∣ly observable: the influence of custom is so pow∣erful, as to create, in different subjects, an intole∣rance of different impressions, though in them∣selves quite innocent; it also produces a facility of bearing, and finally creates a desire for, such things as appeared at first both unnatural and dis∣agreeable.</P>

<P>This appears to be the very hinge on which re∣volves the nature and variety of <HI>temperaments,</HI> so frequently the subjects of physiological discusion. The constitution of the temperaments depends, not only on the proportion and mixture of the consti∣tuent parts of the blood (§ 22.), but also on the peculiar vigour of the vital energies already treat∣ed of; and likewise on the consequent variety in the mode of the reciprocal action and re-action of the body and mind on each other.

<P>Hence the varieties of temperaments are lite∣rally infinite, and can never be reduced to any certain and definite classes.

<P>For although Galen erected this division on an absurd foundation, falsely supposed to be derived from the nature and constituent parts of the blood, yet if this erroneous foundation be kept entirely out of view, the division appears in other respects so consonant to nature, that the different temperaments of all men generally, and of every individual in the different periods of life, may be with propriety referred to one or other of these four leading classes. Thus, in the tender age of infancy the <HI>phlegmatic</HI> temperament chiefly pre∣vails. This in youth is exchanged for the <HI>san∣guineous.</HI>

The <HI>choleric</HI> marks the period of man∣hood. And the <HI>melancholic</HI> is the temperament of old age.</P>
<P>But, as has been already observed, the variety in the existing degrees of the same, and in the mixtures of different temperaments, is so un∣bounded, as to afford an open and a very exten∣sive field of speculation to such as would wish to amuse themselves with tracing out, and establish∣ing, on this subject, more minute combinations, or divisions and orders.</P>

<P>This whole collective assemblage of all the fa∣culties and laws hitherto mentioned, by which the functions of the human body are performed and regulated from the opening, to the closing pulse of life, are called <HI>human nature,</HI> or the <HI>nature of man;</HI> from whence arose the name of <HI>physiology,</HI> the <HI>science</HI> now under our immediate consideration.</P>

<P>Those functions of the body may be themselves properly enough divided into four classes; which division, although not entirely free from exception, nor perfectly conformable to nature, may never∣theless be aptly enough retained as a useful assist∣ant to the memory.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="46" REF="028310_0060_0FD8968D756DD370"/>I.

I am sorry that neither the object nor extent of an elementary work permitted him to descend to a more minute specification of those characteristics, in which the difference between animals and vegetables more immediately consists. <HI>Few</HI> points of investigation can be proposed which have given rise to a greater diversity of opi∣nion, than that which respects the difference between these two classes of natural bodies; and <HI>fewer</HI> still perhaps can be advanced, with regard to which philosophers, even in the pre∣sent imperfect state of physical science, should more unani∣mously agree. Be this later position, however, true or false, I have always been led to consider the strangely diversified, and even contradictory opinions, entertained by naturalists respecting the difference between animals and vegetables, as so many unanswerable testimonies of the equivocality of the whole. The discovery therefore of an exclusive line of dis∣tinction between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, (if in∣deed the supreme author and arbiter of nature permits such a line to exist) must still be considered as a peculiar <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sideratum</HI> in the science of natural history.</P>
<P>From all my speculations on this interesting subject (and it is with me a favourite object of pursuit) I am firmly of opinion, that there exists no incommunicable characteristic, and I will venture to add, no congregation of characteristics, which serve to constitute a complete partition-veil between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. The numerous and highly diversified subjects of these two important kingdoms of life, appear to be nothing else than different individuals of one extensive family, descended from a common parent, and exhibiting the most unequivocal testimonies of their kindred nature. Like the delicate tints of light and shade in a well fin∣ished picture, they so gradually intermingle, and run into each other so insensibly, that it is literally impossible to say with definitude, where the one terminates and the other begins</P>
<P>All researches therefore after an exclusively distinctive cha∣racteristic between vegetables and animals, appear to me equal∣ly irrational and visionary with the late enthusiastic pursuits of the deluded alchemists, after the philosopher's stone, or their more chimerical researches after their flattering <HI>panacea.</HI> Why then should man, presumptuous man! attempt the es∣tablishment of an essential distinction between physical bodies, where wiser <HI>nature</HI> acknowledges none!</P></NOTE>. This class in man includes the connection

<P>It may not be improper on the present occasion to advert to a re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able clause in the writings of Servetus, contained in a phy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al dissertation, which he included in his cele∣brated and very scarce work, that occasioned the death of its illustrious author.

<P>What should be esteemed the definite standard of the celerity of this motion, in a healthy human subject, we are not well able to determine. In this respect there is not only a difference between one subject and another, but there also occurs a great variety relating to this point, arising from the difference of ages: there indeed exists a dif∣ference in the celerity of the blood's motion, even in the different parts of the same body.</P>
<P>Finally, the venous blood appears to glide on more slowly than the arterial; and when flowing through the <HI>trunks</HI> of vessels, its motion is more rapid than when passing their smaller ramifica∣tions. Former physiologists, however, have not∣withstanding exaggerated these several diversities, in the celerity of the blood's motion, beyond their natural magnitude.</P>
<P>The common conclusion, however, on this sub∣ject is, that the blood, flowing through the aorta with its mean velocity, passes over a distance of about eight inches during the space of one pulsa∣tion;

<P>The globules of the cruor appear to revolve on their axes or centres of motion; and it is said that the same are propelled forward with greater velo∣city than the other constituent parts of the blood.

<P>I am fully persuaded, that those globules only glide forward, suspended or swimming in the fluid formed by the other constituent parts of the blood, but that they do not at the same time rotate on their own axes at all. To conclude, it is not
<PB N="53" REF="028310_0067_0FD89698AF25EA70"/>
fully and clearly ascertained, that the blood, be∣sides its <HI>progressive</HI> motion, of which we are now speaking, is also subjected to one of a different kind, called an <HI>intestine</HI> motion; although there can be no doubt, but that the elementary parts of the blood may be occasionally affected to their arrangement and combination, when, they are tumultuously agitated in consequence of the im∣mensely varied directions, the minute divisions and numerous anastomoses of the vessels through which they pass.</P>

<P>All the arterial branches in the human body take their origin from either one or the other of two leading trunks.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> of these trunks is the <HI>pulmonary</HI> artery, which, rising from the anterior ventricle of the heart, passes into the lungs.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="028310_0070_0FD8969DB9F5AD50"/>The <HI>second</HI> is the <HI>aorta,</HI> which rises from the posterior ventricle of the heart, and shoots its ramifications into every part of the system.</P>

<P>An opinion has been conceived and propa∣gated as an established truth, that, throughout the whole sanguiferous system, the <HI>aggregate capa∣city</HI> of all the branches, taken together, is superior to that of the trunk from which such branches directly originate. I fear, however, that the au∣thors of this opinion have expressed themselves on this subject in terms by far too general, and have sometimes even confounded the measure of the diameter of vessels, with that of their area. In my investigations and inquiries on this subject, I did not trust to the result of a single experiment, nor did I confine my experiments to vessels filled with wax, which, however improper, were the only kind used by some celebrated physiologists, in their attempts to ascertain the matter now under consideration; but, as the nature and importance of the subject evidently demanded, I made my experiments and observations on the sound and unaltered vessels of subjects recently dead. I took,
<PB N="57" REF="028310_0071_0FD8969F3B9A9738"/>
for example, that nameless trunk from which the right carotid and subclavian arteries diverge as branches, and also the brachial trunk, together with its branches, the radial and cubital arteries, and having formed a rectangular triangle, from the diameter of the trunk and the diameters of its appended ramifications, I found, from the well known theorem of Pythagoras, that the square of the hypothenuse was equal to the sum of the squares of the base and perpendicular.</P>
<P>Indeed, in arteries of the smallest orders, Haller himself acknowledged that the capacity of the trunks is greater than that of their ramifications; so that, at least, the common calculation does not apply universally, but, (if it be indeed ever admis∣sible), must be restricted to a very few orders of vessels.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="75" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 75.</HEAD>
<P>Each trunk and ramification, separately consi∣dered, have been commonly believed to possess a conical figure, the base, or that part next to the heart, being supposed more capacious than the opposite extremity. This opinion appears however to be hypothetical: for, whoever will take the trouble of examining the arteries with accuracy and attention, will find their figure to be perfectly cylindrical: indeed, on the other hand,
<PB N="58" REF="028310_0072_0FD896A0C76F9468"/>
there are not wanting instances of some arteries which in their progress rather widen and expand, such, for example, are the mammariae internae, or internal mammaries, and even the arch of the aorta itself is more contracted at its base than at its apex or top. All arteries, especially those of the larger orders, appear to be a little dilated and enlarged, just before their division into branches.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="76" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 76.</HEAD>
<P>The number of orders, formed by the divisions of the main arterial trunk into the progressive series of uniformly decreasing ramifications, from its first origin at the heart, to its final termination in the extreme capillaries, cannot possibly be uni∣versally ascertained and established as a general and unvarying result. The truth of this position will be obvious to any one who considers, that in the different parts of the body, especially in the viscera, the arteries are subject to great variety with respect to their divisions; and that, on this account, they sometimes form more, sometimes fewer orders of vessels, previously to their sepa∣ration into evanescent capillaries.</P>
<P>Hence the disagreement of authors who have attempted to amuse themselves with calculations of this kind. Thus, for example, Keil estimated the number of the orders of arteries at fifty, while
<PB N="59" REF="028310_0073_0FD896A2435005C0"/>
Haller contended that they amount to no more than twenty.</P>

<DIV3 N="77" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 77.</HEAD>
<P>After numerous divisions of this kind, and va∣rious anastomoses, by which the neighbouring branches of arteries communicate with each other, they at length arrive at their final terminations, which are completely continuous with, or which fairly open into, the origins of <HI>veins;</HI> so that, their route being uninterrupted, they are reflected from extremities that can scarcely be discerned, and thus converted into those returning vessels, by which the blood, lately arterial, but now become venous, is conveyed back again to the heart.</P>

<HEAD>§ 78.</HEAD>
<P>But although this complete continuity of the arteries and veins be so extremely evident in nu∣merous parts of the body, as to be obvious even to the naked eye, yet it still remains a matter of doubt, whether this be the only and exclusive mode, in which arteries communicate with veins, or whether there may not be, at least in certain parts of the system, an intermediate and parenchy∣matous substance, which receives the blood from the terminations of the arteries, and again depo∣sits it in the incipient mouths of the veins?</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="028310_0074_0FD896A3B8860FF0"/>There occur certain phenomena, such for ex∣ample, as erections of the penis, and the common phenomenon of blushing, which render the ex∣istence of such a connecting medium between those two kinds of vessels, at least not improbable.</P>

<P>There are, again, vessels of a nature evidently different from those already spoken of, which ap∣pear to arise every where from the smaller arte∣rial branches; these vessels consist chiefly of two kinds, namely, <HI>the serous,</HI> which are so narrow as not to be able in a healthy subject to admit the globules of the cruor, but only to receive the thinner fluid or vehicle in which those globules swim (§ 69.); and the <HI>secretory,</HI> which do not appear to attract any thing from the mass of arte∣rial blood, but such specific fluids as are destined for secretion (§ 4.)</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="80" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 80.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the former kind of vessels, which we denominated <HI>serous,</HI> it is necessary to observe, that we do not mean by them the imagi∣nary orders of yellow and of white vessels, spoken of by Boerhaave, which appear to have been fan∣cifully conceived, in conformity to the account given by Leeuwenhoek of his equally imaginary sixfold conformation of the globules of the blood:
<PB N="61" REF="028310_0075_0FD896A539850D48"/>
neither do we mean the neuro-lymphatic vessels of Vieussen and Ferrein, of which those gentle∣men supposed the viscera to be in a great measure composed; but which do not indeed appear to be any better founded than the preceding conjectures of Boerhaave and Leeuwenhoek.</P>
<P>By the <HI>serous</HI> we mean those colourless vessels which are never visible, unless in certain cases of violent inflammation, where the impetus of the blood is very powerful; and indeed in some parts of the body, even this energetic process of nature is not of itself sufficiently powerful to bring them into view, unless they be still farther dilated by means of an anatomical syphon or injector: of this latter description are, for example, the vessels of the cornea, which can scarcely e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be filled with wax, unless in the dead bodies of such subjects as have died while labouring under a violent inflam∣mation of the eyes.</P>

<P>The <HI>secretory</HI> vessels, on the other hand, appear to be different from those, and belong chiefly to the secreting viscera and conglomerate glands; they can also be traced by means of a very subtle injection, which, for instance, when thrown with force into the artery of the parotid gland, flows out and escapes through the duct of Stenonius.

<P>In by far the greater number of the larger veins, such, for example, as exceed in their dia∣meter the twelfth part of an inch, this internal membrane forms, by its foldings, an immense num∣ber of valves of the most beautiful structure, ex∣ceedingly pliant or moveable, and exhibiting the appearance of small sacks: they are, for the most part, simple and alone, frequently however, ar∣ranged

<P>This active organ, by its alternate dilatation and contraction, first receives and again ejects the blood in the following manner. Into the anterior venous sinus, and its appendage, the anterior auri∣cle

of the heart, the blood is conveyed from the whole body, by means of the two <HI>venae cavae,</HI> viz. the superior and inferior, and likewise from the substance of the heart itself, by means of the coro∣nary veins, the common orifice of which is fur∣nished with a valve of a peculiar structure; and from this auricle, it is again conducted into the corresponding ventricle of the same side.</P>

<P>From this anterior ventricle (formerly called the <HI>right</HI> ventricle, in conformity to the situation of the heart in brutes) the blood is thrown into the lungs through the pulmonary artery, which was called by the ancients <HI>vena arteriosa;</HI> from thence, by the four pulmonary veins, called in former times <HI>arteriae venosae,</HI> it is conducted into a common sinus, formed by their conflux, and thence again into the corresponding auricle; these were once called the <HI>left,</HI> but are now more pro∣perly named the <HI>posterior,</HI> sinus and auricle.</P>

<P>From the posterior auricle it passes on to the ventricle of the same side, from whence it is distri∣buted, by means of the aorta, through the whole arterial system appropriated to the other parts of the body, and by the coronary arteries, through the substance of the heart itself.</P>

<DIV3 N="95" TYPE="part">

<P>This circular and regularly progressive motion of the blood through the cavities of the heart, is powerfully directed, and the regurgitations of that fluid are completely prevented, by means of small valves, which surround and serve as portals to the principal avenues which lead to the heart.

<P>Thus a small venous ring or tendon, which forms a partition between the anterior sinus and ventricle, descending into the cavity of the latter, separates into three small valves of a tendinous appearance, each one of which was formerly be∣lieved to divide again into three apices or points,
<PB N="69" REF="028310_0083_0FD896B1F84C8578"/>

But as it does sometimes notwithstand∣ing happen, that the passage of the blood from the right side of the heart into the lungs is by some means obstructed, we then learn from the preternatural pulsation observable in the superior cava, that the blood is repelled in a retrograde di∣rection from the right sinus into the two adjoining great venous trunks.</P>

<P>Observations made on frogs, and even on the minute heart of the nascent chick, prove that in those animals the heart is indeed completely eva∣cuated; but whether or not the same thing takes place in man himself, when in a found state of health, is not yet clearly ascertained; if, however, it be admissible, in physiological discussions to spe∣culate and draw conclusions from the structure and mechanism of those valves themselves, as they ap∣pear on the dissection of the heart, the contrary opinion appears the most probable.</P>

<P>In whatever manner this point may be deter∣mined, one thing we learn from experience, the surest guide to truth, viz. that in a healthy sub∣ject, what is called the pulse of the arteries, is precisely synchronous with, and perfectly corres∣pondent to, the motions of the heart; and like∣wise in a morbid intermission of the pulse, the
<PB N="77" REF="028310_0091_0FD896BE08C65A68"/>
heart and arteries still harmonize in their action, by ceasing from, and again commencing, motion at precisely the same moments.</P>

<P>The frequency of the pulsations of the human heart in a healthy state, is extremely different in different subjects. This diversity arises principally from diversity in point of age, but partially also from other conditions of the system, which at any and every period of life constitute the health pro∣per to each individual; so that it is not possible to ascertain and establish, on this subject, any cer∣tain and definite rule. It may nevertheless be pro∣per to mention the general result of my observa∣tions (made in our own climate) on the frequency of the pulse in the different periods of human life.</P>
<P>In the first days after birth I have generally found the pulsations of the heart of the tender in∣fant, while sound asleep, amount to about 140 in the space of a minute.</P>
<P>At the expiration of the first year, they amount to 124 in a minute.</P>
<P>At the end of the second year to about 110.</P>
<P>At the end of the third year to about 96, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="028310_0092_0FD87FF0228FC740"/>At that period in which the first set of teeth, usually called the milk-teeth, drop out, the pulsa∣tions of the heart amount to 86 in a minute.</P>
<P>At the age of puberty to about 80.</P>
<P>In the prime of life, or at the period of man∣hood, to about 75.</P>
<P>And to about 60 at the sixtieth year of human life.</P>
<P>In subjects still farther advanced in years, I have scarcely found two in whom the number of pulsa∣tions were the same, at the same period of old age.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="110" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 110.</HEAD>
<P>All other circumstances being alike, the pulsa∣tions of the heart are more frequent in females than in males.</P>
<P>If proper and necessary allowance be made for the habit of body, they are less frequent in men uncommonly tall, than in such as are rather low. This circumstance I have ascertained to be a truth by comparative observations made on the pulses of <HI>dwarfs,</HI> and <HI>giants</HI> or men remarkably large.</P>

<P>On the subject of those varieties in the pulse, occasioned by <HI>extraneous circumstances,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>non-naturals,</HI> it is necessary to observe, that a cold climate produces a slow pulse; thus, for instance, the heart of a Greenlander when in perfect health, does not pulsate oftner than from thirty to forty times in a minute.</P>
<P>But it is an observation as common as it is true, that the pulse becomes more frequent after the taking in of aliment, and after an emission of semen. The same effect is also produced on the pulse by a want of sleep, by bodily exercise, or by passions of the mind.</P>

<P>The foregoing observations relate to the na∣tural or healthy pulse, in the consideration of which it seems more consistent, and agreeable to nature, to direct our views to the <HI>heart,</HI> as its ex∣clusive source, than to the arteries, on which physiologists have usually fixed their attention when engaged in the investigation of this subject.</P>
<P>In this incessant routine, the heart continues its pulsations, down to the extreme glimmerings of life's perishable flame; and even <HI>then,</HI> all its parts do not cease from action at the same moment,
<PB N="80" REF="028310_0094_0FD896C339CD60E8"/>
but it is the prerogative of the right ventricle with its appendices, the right auricle and sinous, survive the left ventricle, and its appendices.</P>
<P>This may be sufficiently illustrated in the fol∣lowing manner: After the last act of expiration, the lungs now in a collapsed state, can no longer admit the blood to flow through them in its cus∣tomary channel, while at the same time that wave of blood which they have just returned to the left side of the heart, is from thence forceably expel∣led through the aorta, and thus urges forward by a <HI>vis a tergo</HI> the advancing column of venous blood: from this combination and concurrence of circumstances, the blood returning with preci∣pitation and impetuosity, rushes violently into the appendices and ventricle on the right side of the heart, in consequence of which the parietes of those cavities are thrown into convulsive efforts, and thus continue to be agitated, for some time, after the left side of that organ is completely de∣prived of all vital motion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="113" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 113.</HEAD>
<P>From a knowledge of this <HI>fact,</HI> viz. that during the last vital efforts of declining nature, the blood is propelled into the cavities on the right side of the heart, we deduce, with the ut∣most ease, the <HI>cause</HI> of that state of depletion in
<PB N="81" REF="028310_0095_0FD896C4C0538EA0"/>
which the larger arteries are found after death. To the same cause also Weiss, and after him the illustrious Sabatier, were desirous of attributing the superior size of the cavities on the right, to that of those on the left, side of the heart, espe∣cially in the corpse of an adult subject.</P>

<DIV3 N="114" TYPE="part">

<P>The whole of this motion of the heart, which has been the subject of the preceding observa∣tions, is to a very considerable degree limited and directed by the <HI>pericardium,</HI> in which the heart loosely hangs, and by which it is completely en∣closed as in the walls of a prison.</P>
<P>The pericardium is a membranous sac, consid∣erably capa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious, and accommodated to the figure of the heart which it encloses. It takes its origin from the membranes constituting the mediastinum, and although, from its fineness, it may appear some∣what tender, yet we learn from the experiments of Wintringham, that it is so very tenacious and firm, as far to exceed in strength all other mem∣branes of a similar nature in the human body.</P>
<P>That the pericardium is a part of the first importance in the animal economy, we safely infer from this single circumstance, namely, that throughout all classes of animals possessing red
<PB N="82" REF="028310_0096_0FD896C63AD372C0"/>
blood, it is found as constantly and uniformly ex∣isting as the heart itself; and records do not fur∣nish more than one or two examples of the human heart having been found completely destitute of a pericardium. These singular examples of such an unnatural state of the heart are recorded in the writings of Dinkler.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="115" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 115.</HEAD>
<P>The internal surface of the pericardium is kept constantly humid by a dew-like serous effusion, which appears to exhale from the small arteries of the heart itself.</P>
<P>In like manner a fluid, of a similar nature, ap∣pears to transude into the very cavities of the heart, and to moisten and lubricate their surround∣ing <HI>parietes</HI> or walls.</P>
<P>In either case the effusion during the healthy state of the part is of a serous nature, and not ac∣companied by any real <HI>lymph,</HI> unless the heart be labouring under inflammation; but when this or∣gan becomes the seat of an inflammatory affection, then genuine lymph transudes, giving rise, on the external superficies of the heart, to fiue filaments of a hair-like appearance, together with those preternatural portions of cellular membrane, which in such cases connect the heart to the

<P>HAVING thus completed the consid∣eration of the organs in which the blood is con∣tained, we now pass on to take a view of the powers, by which those organs are qualified and fully prepared to keep that vital fluid in motion.</P>
<P>Let us, in the first place, take an attentive and accurate survey of those powers which reside in the heart itself, and which ought, without doubt, to be considered as by far the most active and es∣sential in the great business of circulation: we will then proceed to consider what may be called the secondary and assistant powers, which we will also find of high importance in the animal econo∣my, from the concurrent and effective aid which they afford to the action of the heart.</P>

<P>It will at first view appear obvious to even the most superficial observer, that it is a matter of Herculean difficulty indeed, either to ascertain by accurate calculation the force of action exerted by the heart, or to determine with precision the quantity of blood thrown into the aorta by that organ at each pulsation; neither will the specula∣tive physiologist find himself beset with difficulties of less moment, when he attempts to ascertain and establish with definitude, either the distance to which each projected wave of blood is carried by the impetus it receives from the heart alone, or yet the celerity with which such wave rolls for∣ward; but he will be surrounded with difficulties, still encreasing at each advancing step, in his at∣tempts to render a just statement and accurate ac∣count of all such obstacles as oppose, and thus greatly diminish the effects of the force exerted by the heart, in its action on the circulating mass of fluids.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="118" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 118.</HEAD>
<P>A certain estimation may nevertheless be formed of the power of the heart, by collecting and com∣paring the most probable conjectures which have appeared on the above points of physiological spe∣culation. Thus for instance, if we suppose the whole mass of blood to amount at a mean rate to
<PB N="85" REF="028310_0099_0FD88257EA5FEA68"/>
33 pounds, <HI>i. e.</HI> 396 ounces (§ 23), and estimate the number of pulsations at 75 in a minute, <HI>i. e.</HI> 4500 every hour (§ 109); and further, if we adopt the opinion that at each systole the left ven∣tricle ejects two ounces of blood, it will then fol∣low, that during the course of every hour the weight of the whole volume of blood makes 22¾ complete transitions through the heart. We may also form a tolerable conception and estimation of the impetus with which the circulating blood is propelled from the left ventricle of the heart, by observing with what astonishing violence, and to what a considerable height, the blood spouts from one of the larger arteries when wounded in the neighbourhood of the heart. Thus, from the wounded carotid of an adult subject, I have seen the blood, during a few of the first contrac∣tions of the heart after the accident, mount in jets to the height of at least five feet.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="119" TYPE="part">

<P>But when we institute an enquiry for the dis∣covery of those unfailing fountains or springs, which supply the heart with a force so powerful, and at the same time so uninterrupted and lasting, that which first attracts our attention, as being foremost both in point of time and importance is its <HI>irritability,</HI> (§ 44). This vital energy, as has been already evinced (§ 90), is much longer pos∣sessed
<PB N="86" REF="028310_0100_0FD8828667C6EC20"/>
by the heart, than by any other muscular part in the whole human body.</P>
<P>That the parietes, or walls themseves of the cavities, are irritated and excited to contract by reiterated impressions from the circulating waves of blood, is manifest from a well known experiment of the illustrious Haller. From this celebrated experiment, of that indefatigable physiologist and acute philosopher, it app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that he could at pleasure grant, either to the right or left side of the heart, the prerogative of a more protracted vital motion, (<HI>i.e.</HI> of longer life) accordingly as he first deprived the one side or the other of its peculiar stimulus, the blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Haller "De motu cordis a stimulo nato," in Commentar.

<P>When the proportional quantity of the blood is well adjusted to the size of the containing vessels, and its quality uncontaminated by any morbid change, its action on the heart, and the re-action of that organ again on the blood, proceed with such an equable, regular and happy facility, that, when in a state of rest, we are scarcely sensible of the circulation of this vital fluid, which is the kind and constant dispenser of life and vigour to every part of our bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="028310_0101_0FD8828CA6DC8838"/>But if the circulating volume of blood be either too abundant, or preternaturally scanty, but espe∣cially if this vital fluid be contaminated by the admixture of any foreign substance, as noxious miasmata, ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in an elastic state, or poisons in∣jected into the veins, &amp;c. the heart, either roused immediately into excessive action, or depressed to the opposite extreme of prostration and debility, continues no longer fit for the salutary discharge of its important function, but falls into motions convulsive, irregular, and very widely different from the equable tenor of its healthy action.

<P>It has been a point of controversy, even in very modern times, whether this extreme irritability of the heart be essentially inherent in its own sub∣stance, or if it be nor rather adventitious, and de∣rived, as some celebrated characters would induce the world to believe, from the mysterious influence of the nerves? We will hereafter have a fit oppor∣tunity of declaring our sentiments respecting the whole of this controversy, when we come to con∣sider the doctrine of <HI>muscular irritability,</HI> under which head, this subject of inquiry most naturally
<PB N="88" REF="028310_0102_0FD88244C6692CA0"/>
falls. On the present occasion it may suffice to observe, that I am daily more and more convince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that irritability is a species of vital energy altoge∣ther peculiar in its nature, belonging exclusively to muscular fibres, and completely distinct from the <HI>vis nervea</HI> (§ 34, 45.) But, on the other hand, it is no less evident and incontrovertible, that the nerves do also possess a very powerful in∣fluence and command over the action of the heart: this we learn, as well from the peculiar habit and appearance of the cardiac nerves, from their soft∣ness, their defect of covering, and their singular disposition and arrangement, as from the astonish∣ing consent of the heart with by far the greater number of the functions of the human body, even with those of the most opposite nature. In testi∣mony of the reality of this consent, it may be sufficient barely to mention, the sudden and tran∣sient sympathy which, even in a healthy subject, exists between all the passions of the mind and the heart, together with that, which, in a great many species of disease, manifests itself between this organ and the <HI>primae viae.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="122" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 122.</HEAD>
<P>But, besides those vital energies of the heart, it possesses also another power, arising out of its mechanical structure, which appears to contribute not a little towards carrying on the circulation of
<PB N="89" REF="028310_0103_0FD8828DEA2E62B8"/>
the blood. The cavities of this organ being closely contracted, in the time of its systole, and the blood by this means completely expelled, a vacuum is thus produced, into which, on the prin∣ciples of the well known law of <HI>derivation,</HI> the neighbouring blood must of necessity flow; for, as the valves prevent the regurgitation of the wave just ejected, it follows of course, that the cavities of the heart must then drink in, and swallow down, with rapidity, the blood advancing in the trunks of the veins.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="123" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 123.</HEAD>
<P>We proceed now to enquire, whether or not, any of the other organs through which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood passes, besides the heart itself, are furnished with powers contributary to the continuance of the circulation of that fluid. Judging from first prin∣ciples, or <HI>a priori,</HI> as it is termed, we are led to suspect that such powers do exist; for it appears hardly probable, that the wisdom of nature has entrusted so important a function, on which the life of sanguiferous animals immediately depends, to one organ only, the faults and defects of which might, in such case, with too much facility, be attended with fatal consequences. But, reasoning <HI>a posteriori,</HI> as they term it, <HI>i. e.</HI> from actual ob∣servations, made on the animal economy, we are furnished with numerous facts sufficient to establish,
<PB N="90" REF="028310_0104_0FD8828F69D1B428"/>
beyond a doubt, the existence of such powers, which we may therefore term <HI>secondary powers,</HI> and which are able, not only to aid the action of the heart, but, in some cases, to compensate for almost the complete absence of the influence of that important organ. A striking instance of this nature, is the continued <HI>motion</HI> of the <HI>blood,</HI> in certain parts of the body, on which the power of the heart can have but very little effect, if indeed it can extend to them at all: this phenomenon is observable, as well in the venous system of the liver, as in the placenta of the uterus; not to mention numerous instances of foetuses having been born, without the smallest vestige of a heart.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="124" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 124.</HEAD>
<P>Of these <HI>secondary powers,</HI> the first to be men∣tioned is, the <HI>functions of the arteries,</HI> the influ∣ence of which, in promoting and continuing the circulation of the blood, appears to be, indeed, very considerable; although the true principles and mode of their action, on this fluid, have not yet been fully developed and established.</P>
<P>Speaking in general terms, there exists a very considerable resemblance between the arteries and the heart itself: that the arteries, for example, have a <HI>muscular coat,</HI> is a fact of the utmost pub∣licity (§ 72.)</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="028310_0105_0FD882946AC8C628"/>That they also possess irritability, has been very generally known, since the famous experiments of the illustrious Verschuir.</P>
<P>And, further, as the aspect or disposition of the cardiac nerves on the heart itself is truly singular, thus also the larger branches of the arteries are, here and there, surrounded with astonishing reti∣cular intertextures of soft nerves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="125" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 125.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, It is well known to every one that the arteries pulsate, and that indeed with such vehe∣mence and force, that if we suffer one of our legs to lie over the other knee, the pulsations of the popliteal artery are sufficient to elevate in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ub∣sultory manner, the superincumbent leg not only alone, but even with a very considerable weight appended to it. Indeed for a long time past, both a systolic contraction and diastolic relaxation have been attributed to the arteries, which motions have been said to correspond and harmonize with the alternate contractions and dilatations of the ventircles of the heart.</P>
<P>Though the truth of this last proposition is generally believed to be established and confirmed by the simple testimony of the senses themselves, the subject is nevertheless still embarrassed with
<PB N="92" REF="028310_0106_0FD882956A555378"/>
various doubts and difficulties: these difficulties immediately rise to view, when it is asked, whether this vibrating or pulsatory motion, which is felt on examination by the finger, is to be attributed to the inherent energy of the ar∣teries, or to the impulse of the heart; and whether the whole motion of the arteries does not depend solely on the impetus with which the blood is projected into the aorta, and thus im∣pinges against the sides of that tube, and its rami∣fications?</P>
<P>Dissections of living animals have not been suf∣ficient to decide this controversy. For it some∣times happens that during the live-dissections of warm blooded animals you may discover the lar∣ger arteries pulsating, while at other times again they appear in a state of complete rest. In man himself, while in the enjoyment of vitality, I had once an occasional opportunity of observing the neighbouring trunks of the aorta and pulmonary artery, to be perfectly destitute of all motion; but it should not be forgotten, that this phenome∣non appeared in a case of monstrous or preterna∣tural formation of the parts. There are also ar∣teries which we sometimes feel in a state of violent pulsation, and which we nevertheless know, from anatomy, are, in consequence of their situation, almost immoveable; of this we have an example
<PB N="93" REF="028310_0107_0FD88299F0B3D1B8"/>
in the cerebral carotid, where it passes through the canal of the <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> petrosum.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="126" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 126.</HEAD>
<P>When all circumstances relative to this subject are impartially weighed and dispassionately consi∣dered, this appears to be the result, viz. that the <HI>diastole</HI> of the larger arteries takes place in conse∣quence of their peculiar nature, and is to be attri∣buted to the impetus of the blood rushing for∣cibly into them, and expanding their coats or tu∣nics, which, by means of their elasticity, imme∣diately return again to their natural dimensions. To the same impulse also should be attributed that lateral or curving motion of their axes, which may frequently be observed in the larger arteries when they run in a serpentine direction, and lie embedded in soft cellular membrane.</P>
<P>But in a sound state of the system, we contend that the arteries scarcely exhibit any unequivocal proofs of a <HI>true systole,</HI> i. e. they do not by a ge∣nuine contraction recede from their <HI>natural,</HI> to <HI>smaller</HI> dimensions, as long as the heart is adequate to the due performance of its momentous func∣tion; but although it be certain, that the arteries do not always, yet we acknowledge that they do sometimes, exhibit and exercise a power of real contraction: thus for instance, when the heart is
<PB N="94" REF="028310_0108_0FD8829CB2963DB8"/>
deficient in its action in consequence of labouring under either a morbid ossification, or some other species of disease, it is probable that then the duties of this important organ devolve on, and are discharged by, the arteries, and that the blood is thus kept in motion by the vital energy of those animated tubes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="127" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 127.</HEAD>
<P>As it has been the decided opinion of several celebrated physiologists, especially the famous Whytt, that the powers of the heart cannot pos∣sibly extend their influence to blood-vessels of the smallest order, as, for example, to the extreme terminations of the arteries, and to the incipient radicles of the veins; they have therefore attri∣buted the motion of the blood, in that part of the system, to a certain oscillatory action of those mi∣nute vessels themselves, by the help of which their contents are propelled forward: and this same vi∣bratory motion they have also applied, with a great deal of ingenuity, to explain and demon∣strate the nature of inflammation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are indeed a variety of phenomena, as well <HI>physiological,</HI> which shall be mentioned when on the subject of animal heat, as <HI>pathological,</HI> par∣ticularly observable in spasmodie affections, ac∣companied with fever, which seem to favour the
<PB N="95" REF="028310_0109_0FD8829DAA863B00"/>
existence of such a power of oscillatory motion, although no such motion has ever been actually observed, even with the assistance of glasses, in the dissections of living animals.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="128" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 128.</HEAD>
<P>It yet remains to enquire also after those assist∣ant powers, by which the other parts of the veins, besides their radicles or incipient roots, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itted to complete finally the return of the blood to the heart. It appears, indeed, at the first view of the subject, that the veins possess and exert a much smaller portion of the active vital energies than the other parts of the sanguiferous system, because the return of the vital fluid, contained in those vessels, towards the heart, seems to be owing to the impetus of the arterial blood urging it on by a <HI>vis a tergo,</HI> as well as to the valvular structure of the veins themselves, which effectually prevents the blood from regurgitating. That these minute valves are of the utmost importance in promoting and continuing the regular and free circulation of the blood, is satisfactorily demonstrated by the fre∣quent congestions and infarctions, which happen in those veins that originate in the inferior parts of the abdominal cavity, and which are entirely de∣stitute of such valves.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="028310_0110_0FD8829F50AB8460"/>But there are nevertheless a variety of argu∣ments which render it probable, that the trunks of the veins do possess, and actually exert, certain degrees of the vital energies; as is well exempli∣fied in the veins of the liver, and of the uterine placenta (§ 123.), &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is also well known to every one, that the ex∣periments first instituted by the illustrious Ver∣schuir, are highly in favour of the existence of a vital energy in the veins.</P>
<P>And, that the two leading and extreme venom trunks have a stratum of a true muscular nature, we have briefly hinted on a former occasion (§ 84).</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="129" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 129.</HEAD>
<P>These are indeed the leading powers which are active in promoting the circulation of the blood, and which derive their origin from the very structure of the vessels in which this fluid is con∣tained.

<P>I also pass over in silence the more remote and inconsiderable aids, which, in a human subject after

<P>THE <HI>lungs,</HI> which are very intimately connected with the heart, as well from the vicinity of their situation, as from their uniform intercourse in the performance of their important function, are two viscera, large in the human subject after birth, but of such specific lightness, as to float on the surface of water.

During these progressive and multiplex divisions into inferior orders, both the small carti∣laginous rings, and their muscular coat gradually disappear, till the evanescent extremities of the tubes finally terminate in those minute cells, which constitute by far the greater and more im∣portant part of the substance of the lungs, as their office is to receive, and again discharge the vivify∣ing aerial element, in the process of respiration.</P>

<P>Those small air cells do not appear to possess uniformly, either the same <HI>figure</HI> or <HI>dimensions.</HI> With respect to the former of these, (viz. their figure), it is in general that of a polyhedron. The latter, (<HI>i. e.</HI> their dimensions), as far as their super∣ficial extent is embraced in the consideration, can∣not without the utmost difficulty, be ascertained; but, if we consider only their <HI>aggregate capacity,</HI> this, in the lungs of an adult subject, whose inspi∣rations are full and strong, is sufficient to admit and contain about 60 cubic inches of air. We do not here speak of the immense size, to which the lungs may be expanded by inflation, after the tho∣rax is opened, but only of the quantity and volume of air which they do actually admit in the living subject, when the process of respiration is per∣formed with ease and vigour.</P>

<P>These vesicles or cells, destined for the reception of air, are every where surrounded and bound together by that common, but extremely tender, cellular membrane, which, as we have already learned, constitutes a general <HI>vinculum</HI> or bond of union to the whole body. But it is necessary to distinguish clearly and accurately between the two kinds of cells which exist in the pulmonic system. I have seen the air cells so separate and distinct,
<PB N="100" REF="028310_0114_0FD882A574475CA0"/>
in the lungs of a healthy human subject, that a per∣son's breath, gently and cautiously blown through a very minute and tender ramification of the bron∣chiae, would elevate only a single circumscribed cluster of vessels or cells, and would neither pass into the neighbouring cells of the same kind, nor yet into the common cellular membrane, which is every where interposed between those cells in∣tended for the reception of air. But, if the breath be urged with considerable force, the air cells will be lacerated, and such a communication form∣ed with the surrounding cellular membrane, as to give free passage to the subtle elastic fluid, and thus the whole and every part, of the pulmonary lobe, will appear to be inflated.</P>

<P>This exceedingly tender cellular membrans, which encloses and lies between the air vesicles of the lungs, is every where interspersed with innu∣merable small ramifications of both kinds of pul∣monary vessels, viz. of the pulmonary artery, and of the four pulmonary veins, the branches of which accompany the branches of the bronchiae, and afterwards, form in their course, by an im∣mense number of divisions and subsequent anasto∣moses, reticular intertextures, and expansions of ex∣treme fineness and subtilty. This truly astonishing reticular tissue, running in all directions through
<PB N="101" REF="028310_0115_0FD882A767B4A088"/>
the cellular membrane, so completely surrounds, and closely embraces, the cells destined for the reception of air, that the whole volume of blood, which passes in an incessant round through the pulmonic system, is separated from the air taken in at each inspiration, by nothing else than mem∣branes so amazingly fine and subtle, as scarcely to be equal in thickness, (according to the observa∣tions and calculations of Hales), to the one thou∣sandth part of an inch.</P>

<P>As we have already observed, that each indivi∣dual ramification of the bronchiae has appended to it its own peculiar cluster of air vesicles (§ 135), so likewise it appears, that to every individual vesicle of each cluster is peculiarly appropriated its own system of small blood vessels, the minute rami∣fications of which communicate very frequently with one another, forming those surprising reticu∣lar tissues aleady spoken of, but scarcely appear to anastomose, in any degree, with the small blood-vessels of the adjacent clusters. That this is a truth we are taught, if I am not deceived, as well from microscopical observations made on the lungs of living frogs and serpents, as from more minute and successful injections of the lungs of human subjects: the same thing is also further evidenced by certain pathological phenomena which may be

<P>It is necessary to mention also, in the last place, that singular and striking apparatus of lymphatic vessels, which spreads and appears, in a more parti∣cular manner, on the external membrane by which the lungs are invested. To this apparatus of ves∣sels belongs that numerous assemblage of lympha∣tic or conglobate glands, which, though of a quite different and distinct order, are nevertheless com∣monly confounded, through mistake, with those glands in their neighbourhood, which are called <HI>bronchiales.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>thorax,</HI> in which the lungs are securely enclosed, has for its foundation or skeleton, bones and cartilages, arranged and disposed somewhat like the walls or sides of a cave. Though this bony cavity, taken together as an entire whole, be to a considerable degree firm and steady, yet most of its parts are so pliant and moveable, as to be well adapted for the performance of those mo∣tions which the business of respiration requires.</P>
<P>This pliability, or facility of motion is particu∣larly observable in six pairs of the true ribs, which
<PB N="103" REF="028310_0117_0FD882491E33E348"/>
being placed beneath the superior and first pair, are more moveable in proportion as their situation is lower; or their aptitude for motion is com∣mensurate with the superior length of their bodies, and cartilaginous appendices, which connect them to the margins on each side of the sternum, by a species of articulation called <HI>amphiarthrosis.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="140" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 140.</HEAD>
<P>Between the edges of those ribs lie two strata of intercostal muscles, the fibres of which assume indeed and pursue different directions, but which, nevertheless, co-operate in their action in pro∣ducing the same motion in the parts to which they are attached.</P>
<P>Across the basis or inferior part of the whole of this cavity the <HI>diaphragm</HI> is stretched, somewhat in the form and direction of an arch. This is a muscle worthy of particular attention, and, to use the words of Haller, next in importance to the heart itself; its parts appear to depend chiefly on the phrenic nerve for their fitness to co-operate in the function of respiration, as was long since de∣monstrated by the celebrated live-dissections of the immortal Galen.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="028310_0118_0FD882AD75931298"/>The diaphragm alternates for the most part, by an antagonizing motion, with the muscles of the abdomen, especially with the <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal oblique,</HI> and the <HI>transverse</HI> muscles.</P>

<P>The thorax thus formed and finished is, in the living human subject after birth, alternately dilat∣ed at the time of each inspiration, and contracted again to its former dimensions in every subsequent act of expiration.</P>
<P>In inspiration, the enlargement of the tho∣racic cavity extends, in a more especial manner, <HI>laterally</HI> and <HI>downwards,</HI> so that the bodies of those ribs of which we have particularly spoken (§ 139) are elevated, and their inferior margins or edges turned in some degree outwards; while, at the same time, the arch of the diaphragm is somewhat depressed, and brought nearer to the position of a <HI>plain,</HI> or level surface.</P>
<P>But as to what is boldly asserted of the sternum, viz. that its inferior end is at the same time pro∣truded forward, this is a phenomenon which I must confess, I have never been able to observe in the tranquil and unmolested respiration of a healthy person.</P>

<P>This alternate motion of the thorax, which in a healthy subject is indeed performed spontane∣ously and without effort, is uniformly continued from the moment of birth to the extinction of life, for the following necessary and important pur∣poses, namely, that the lungs themselves may, by a similar vicissitude of motion, be expanded for the free admission and convenient reception of the air we inspire, and again contracted in order that the same may be forthwith expelled.</P>

<P>For man, together with all other warm blooded animals, is prevented, by absolute necessity, from a lengthy retention of the air which he inspires; he is obliged, after a very short period to discharge it again, and exchange it for a fresh supply of this <HI>vital pabulum</HI> or <HI>food,</HI> as the air has been termed, even from the most remote ages. It appears in∣deed from the most common observation, that the air which is inspired and retained any time in the lungs, however great may have been its original purity, suffers, in a very short time, such remark∣able changes as affect it with the most obvious contamination, and, unless it be speedily renewed, render it wholly unfit to be any farther employed in the important process of respiration.</P>

<PB N="106" REF="028310_0120_0FD882AF233AFB60"/>
<HEAD>§ 144.</HEAD>
<P>Enquiries have been instituted for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of those changes which the air we inspire undergoes in our lungs. Such changes certainly do not arise, as was formerly believed, from the loss of any mysterious principle of elasticity, which resides in the air, but are evi∣dently produced by a decomposition of its elemen∣tary parts. For the atmospheric air which we breathe is truly an astonishing mixture of elemen∣tary substances, very widely different from each other in their natures. Not to mention the va∣rious heterogenous matters which this necessary fluid contains; such, for example, as the aerial seeds of the smallest and most simple plants, the odorous effluvia arising from numerous bodies, volumes of dust, and a thousand other similar sub∣stances, which for the most part float in the at∣mosphere. Not to mention, I say, these hetero∣genous bodies at all, the air which we breathe always contains aqueous exhalations in larger or smaller quantities, and is also more or less charged with the matters of electricity and magnetism. But finally, though the whole of the foregoing substances be left entirely out of view, yet even then the air of our atmosphere does not consist of one simple aeriform fluid, but is composed of de∣phlogisticated, phlogisticated, and fixed airs.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="028310_0121_0FD882B30E793340"/>The proportion of those elementary matters, especially of such as are organic, is varied ex∣tremely from diversity of places, and by the nature of the bodies which exist in these places. It is in the mean time, however, the common estimation, that the air of our atmosphere consists of about ¼th, part of dephlogisticated, 11/16ths of phlogisti∣cated, and 1/6th of fixed air.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="145" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 145.</HEAD>
<P>It appears, that at each inspiration, (in which an adult subject, breathing in a quiet and tranquil manner, draws in about 30 cubic inches of air,) a fourth part of the dephlogisticated air is decom∣posed, and, in a great measure, exchanged for phlogisticated and fixed airs; so that the expired fluid, being received into a proper vessel, extin∣guishes flame or coals when immersed into it, pre∣cipitates lime from the water which suspends it, and far exceeds atmospheric air in its specific gra∣vity, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="146" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 146.</HEAD>
<P>It is probable that the igneous parts of the de∣phlogisticated air, <HI>i. e.</HI> those parts suited to favour the process of combustion, being set at liberty by the decomposition which takes place in the lungs, enters the arterial blood, and is thus distributed throughout the whole body; while, on the other
<PB N="108" REF="028310_0122_0FD882B5CCBD90F0"/>
hand, the basis of fixed air is carried back, along with the phlogisticated and venous blood, to the right side of the heart, and thence (as the an∣cients were pleased to express themselves) ex∣creted through the lungs like foot.</P>
<P>The more florid dye of the arterial blood, the more obscure colour of the venous, and the simili∣tude of colours imparted to both kinds of blood, when exposed to the action of those species of air now under our consideration (§ 16), are circum∣stances very much in favour of the preceding opinions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="147" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 147.</HEAD>
<P>In a foetus which has never yet re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eived vital air into its own pulmonic system, there is in general less difference between the arterial and venom blood, than in an adult subject, in whom the pro∣cess of respiration has already taken place.</P>
<P>After the infant is born, the new sensation, ex∣cited by the contact of an unusual element, in an animal which had hitherto led an aquatic life, and the application of various other stimuli altogether new, appear to afford us a happy clue for explain∣ing the new motions which at that period take place in the body, more especially the dilatation of the thorax and the first act of inspiration.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="028310_0123_0FD8824D8F20CD80"/>When the lungs are dilated by this first complete act of inspiration, a new passage is thus opened through them for the blood, so that this fluid is ever after diverted from the umbilical vessels to the thorax.</P>
<P>But when this inspired air is, by that decompo∣sition of its elementary parts, of which we have already spoken, rendered both noxious and trou∣blesome to the lungs, I ascribe to the most simple preservative efforts of nature, the immediately sub∣sequent motion, by which this poisonous mephitis is exspired, and profitably exchanged for a fresh supply of the fostering pabulum of life.</P>
<P>From all the foregoing circumstances, taken collectively, (especially if we attend to the great influence of respiration on the circulation of the blood, as demonstrated by the well known experi∣ment of Hooke), we are furnished with a much better explanation of the celebrated problem of Harvey, than has yet been given by most of the other reiterated labours of physiologists, who have attempted to solve that difficulty.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XII. OF VOICE AND SPEECH.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="148" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 148.</HEAD>
<P>THE leading function of respiration has been already the subject of our consideration. We will speak, in another place, of the part which this sublime process acts, in blending and intimately uniting the chyle with the blood, and also of the services which it renders, in a variety of ways, to almost the whole class of <HI>natural functions,</HI> (§ 63.112.) We now proceed to consider its other uses in the animal economy.</P>
<P>The first object or phenomenon which attracts our attention, in this investigation, is the Voice, which belongs to the human subject after birth, and evidently proceeds from the lungs, as was long since very justly observed by Aristotle, who said, that no animals are vocal, <HI>i. e.</HI> possess the power of emitting sound, but such as breathe through lungs. For, by the denomination of <HI>voice,</HI> we properly designate that sound formed, by means of the exspired air, in the <HI>larynx,</HI> which is a small apparatus or machine of the most exquisite struc∣ture, placed on the top of the wind-pipe or <HI>aspera
<PB N="111" REF="028310_0125_0FD882BD5EF99890"/>
arteria,</HI> somewhat like a capital on the summit of a column.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="149" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 149.</HEAD>
<P>This small machine is composed of various car∣tilages joined together somewhat after the form of a capsula or casket. These cartilages are furnished with a great and truly admirable apparatus of mus∣cles, in consequence of which, not only the whole are rendered fit for motion collectively, but some of them are also enabled to move individually and alone, according to the different variations about to be produced in the voice.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="150" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 150.</HEAD>
<P>That part which is more particularly engaged in the immediate generation of the voice is the <HI>glottis,</HI> a very narrow passage leading into the wind-pipe from above, to which is prefixed, or applied as a lid, a minute cartilage called the <HI>epiglottis.</HI> That sound is produced by the air expelled from the lungs, striking, in a proper direction and with due force, against the edges of this strait passage, is a matter too plain to admit of a doubt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="151" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 151.</HEAD>
<P>Controversies have existed on the subject of those changes that take place in the glottis, by which the modulations of the voice are produced,
<PB N="112" REF="028310_0126_0FD882BEAC0AEED0"/>
namely, Whether this cartilaginous part be alter∣nately expanded and contracted, as was the opi∣nion of Galen, and afterwards of Dodart? or, Whether the variations of the voice do not rather depend on the tension and relaxation of its liga∣ments, as was held by Ferrein?</P>
<P>The latter of those, therefore, compared the primary organ of the voice to a <HI>violin,</HI> the former to a <HI>flute</HI>—i. e. the one set of disputants conceived it to emit sound on the principles of a <HI>corded,</HI> the other on those of a <HI>wind, instrument</HI> of music.</P>
<P>From a faithful collection, and impartial consi∣deration, of all the arguments which have been advanced on this contested point, we are of opi∣nion, that both kinds of changes do actually take place in the glottis when employed in the emission of sound; but we, nevertheless, believe, that the principal and most important of those changes de∣pend on and arise from the tension of the liga∣ments, more especially of the <HI>thyreo-arytonoidel inferiores</HI> (which appear to have been the vocal cords of Ferrein.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="152" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 152.</HEAD>
<P>That all this mobility of the glottis, of whatever kind it may be, is influenced and wholly direct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by the numerous muscles which belong, and are
<PB N="113" REF="028310_0127_0FD8824FC9831EA0"/>
attached, to the larynx, may be fully established by the following beautiful experiment, viz. If the recurrent or wandering nerves (as they are termed) be either secured in light ligatures, or completely cut asunder, the voice of the animals subjected to such experiments, will be in the former case, ren∣dered extremely weak and low, and in the latter, entirely destroyed.</P>

<P>The faculty of <HI>whistling</HI> belongs in common both to the human species, and to small birds of note. To qualify them for this, singing birds are furnished with a bifurcated <HI>larynx</HI> at each extre∣mity of the <HI>aspera arteria.</HI> But though human subjects be supplied with only one plain and simple larynx, yet they learn to imitate those small ani∣mals, as appears to me, by a co-arction or pucker∣ing up of their lips.</P>

<P>But <HI>song,</HI> which is composed of speech and a harmonious modulation of the voice, I would con∣sider as peculiar to man alone, and as constituting the leading prerogative of his vocal organs. The faculty of whistling is, as already observed, a part of the birth-right of birds: a numerous train of the feathered race, and sometimes even dogs them∣selves, have also been taught to pronounce a va∣riety
<PB N="114" REF="028310_0128_0FD882C0295538F8"/>
of words. But I doubt extremely indeed, whether any brute animals have ever yet possessed a faculty of true and genuine song; whereas, on the other hand, I believe there scarcely exists a a nation so barbarous, where song does not very generally prevail.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="155" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 155.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Speech</HI> itself is a peculiar modification of the voice, chiefly by the aid of the tongue, but par∣tially also by that of the lips, the teeth, the palate, and by the further assistance of the nose, combined into the formation of words.</P>
<P>Hence the difference between <HI>voice</HI> and <HI>speech</HI> appears very obvious and plain: the first is evi∣dently formed in the larynx itself; whereas the latter is effected by the singular mechanism of the other organs already mentioned. It is but just and proper, however, to observe, that this last position is not capable of universal application, as there are a few nations (of which the Sinensians may serve as an example), among whom their al∣most <HI>homonymous</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A word is said to be homonymous, when it is highly equivocal, or used indiscriminately to represent a discordant variety of objects or things.</NOTE> words are distinguished only by a varied modulation of the <HI>voice</HI> itself.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="028310_0129_0FD88252BAD3B140"/>But further, voice belongs in common to brutes as well as to man; it is possessed also by the new-born babe, nor is it wholly denied to such unhap∣py infants as have passed their lives amidst the haunts, and in the gloomy society, of wild beasts, nor even to those that have been born without the sense of hearing. But speech is not acquired till after the cultivation and exercise of <HI>reason;</HI> it constitutes, therefore, no less than that operation of the mind itself, a characteristic privilege, and distinctive prerogative between man and the rest of the animal kingdom. To serve all the pur∣poses, and answer all the demands of brutes, that instinct with which nature has beneficently supplied them, is completely adequate; of this instinct, however, man is destitute, as also of such other aids and individual powers as might enable him to preserve and sustain life by his own solitary exer∣tions; he is therefore kindly furnished with the prerogatives of <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>speech,</HI> by means of which, embracing the advantages, and discharg∣ing the duties, annexed to a social state, he is able both to disclose his own wants, and relieve those of his fellow creatures.</P>

<P>That truly admirable mechanism, by means of which speech and the pronunciation of letters are

effected, has, since the celebrated researches of that paradoxical character, Franc. Mercur. Hel∣mont, been very much illustrated and explained by further and later enquiries, especially those of Jo. Wallis and Conr. Ammanus.</P>
<P>That <HI>division</HI> of the letters by Ammanus into I. Vowels, II. Semivowels, and III. Consonants, is, of all others, by far the most simple and na∣tural.</P>

<P>Finally, It yet remains to mention certain other modifications of the human voice, which usually occur as symptoms, or signs of either particular passions of the mind, or more violent affections of the organs of respiration.

<P>Most of the modifications which immediately follow, are connected together by such a powerful kindred alliance, that one of them is not unfre∣quently observed to pass into another. It must be also further observed, that the greater part of them do not always assume and exhibit the same uniform appearance, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To speak, however, in general terms, in the act of <HI>laughing,</HI> exspirations short, interrupted, and in some measure broken, follow each other in quick succession.</P>
<P><HI>Crying</HI> produces deep inspirations, which sud∣denly alternate with lengthy exspirations fre∣quently interrupted and broken.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="028310_0132_0FD882C92C3DC288"/><HI>Sighing</HI> consists in a lengthy, full, and strong in∣spiration, and a subsequent flow exspiration, which is not unfrequently accompanied with somewhat of a <HI>groan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coughing</HI> is produced by quick and sonorous exspirations succeeding a deep inspiration.</P>
<P><HI>Sneezing</HI> is a more violent and somewhat con∣vulsive exspiration, which had been preceeded by a short and forcible inspiration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hickup</HI> on the other hand consists entirely of a single inspiration, <HI>sonorous,</HI> extremely <HI>sudden,</HI> and at the same time of a <HI>convulsive</HI> nature.</P>
<P>The present seems a very suitable occasion to speak of the phenomenon of yawning, which con∣sists in a full, slow, and lengthy inspiration, suc∣ceeded again by a similar exspiration, while, at the same time, the jaws are drawn so very widely asunder, that the air which is received into the expanded fauces can enter with ease the <HI>Eusta∣chean tubes.</HI> One thing peculiar to this pheno∣menon is, its being extremely contagious, i. e. it very readily excites to imitation: the cause of this is, without doubt, to be sought for in the remem∣brance of the agreeable sensatious produced at a former time, by the languid operation of yawning.</P>

<HEAD>§ 159.</HEAD>
<P>IT is worthy of observation, that man in a living state, together with the other subjects be∣longing to the class Mammalia, as well as the whole feathered race, are distinguished from the rest of the animal kingdom by this peculiarity, that the native heat of their bodies far exceeds, in degrees of temperature, the usual heat of the medium or element in which they live. With respect to man himself, it is however to be remembered, that he appears to be inferior, in the heat of his system, to those other kinds of animals we have just men∣tioned. Thus, in our climate, the heat of the human body generally stands at about the 96th degree of Fahrenheit's scale, whereas, in other animals belonging to the class Mammalia, the vital temperature very considerably exceeds this point, while it ascends still higher in individuals of the feathered tribes.</P>

general, (provided we make allowance for the state of health peculiar to each individual), its range will include but a very few degrees of the thermometer, whether the subject be exposed to the inclemencies of the most rigorous climate, or placed beneath the fervors of a tropical sky.

Ellis, been refuted by a great number of characters learned in the science of physiology, and the reverse completely demon∣strated and est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>blished by experiments well adapted to the nature of the subject. In this particular, indeed, appears to consist one of the great prero∣gatives of man, that imprisoned and confined to no one climate or zone of the earth, he is able to pass his life in any section of the immense globe we inhabit, and is free to fix his habitation either beneath the rigors of Hudson's stormy channel, where the quicksilver passes spontaneously to a state of complete congelation, amidst the tempests of Nova Zembla, or in the bosom of those glaring solar fires, which scorch the glowing shores of the Senegal.</P>

<P>We proceed now to enquire into the origin and source of that astonishing fire, which minutely pervades our bodies, and uniformly supplies them with their necessary degrees of warmth. To pass in silence over the visionary conjectures of the ancients on this subject, some of the moderns have attempted to derive animal heat, with all its phe∣nomena, from the matter of electricity and the nerves, others from the attrition generated by the circulation of the blood, others from the recipro∣cal friction between the solid elementary parts of living animals, while others, again, have embraced and defended different opinions.</P>

<P>But all those hypotheses are embarrassed with insurmountable difficulties, whereas, on the other hand, the utmost simplicity, and an entire cor∣respondence to the phenomena of nature, combine in recommending and confirming that doctrine, in which the lungs are considered as the <HI>focus</HI> or <HI>fire-place</HI> where animal heat is generated, and the de∣phlogisticated part of the air which we breathe, as the <HI>fuel</HI> that supports the vital flame. That justly celebrated character, Jo. Mayow, sketched out, formerly, the leading traces and first great outlines of this doctrine, which, in our times, has been greatly improved, extended, and farther

elucidated, by the labours of the illustrious Craw∣ford.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="163" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 163.</HEAD>
<P>The whole drift and tenor of Crawford's theory obviously results in this, that <HI>respiration,</HI> no less than <HI>combustion,</HI> belongs to such processes as are called phlogistic; in which the phlogiston residing in, and constituting a part of, our bodies, is ex∣pelled by the accession of <HI>free</HI> or <HI>sensible</HI> heat, (which ought to be carefully distinguished from heat existing in a <HI>fixed</HI> or <HI>latent</HI> state.)</P>
<P>For phlogiston and the matter of heat are ele∣ments of such contrary and opposite natures, that the greater quantity of the one our bodies at any time contain, the less, at the same time, is their proportion of the other; thus, fixed air, for ex∣ample, is not supposed to contain more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th part of the quantity of the matter of heat, which belongs to an equal weight of atmospheric air, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But it appears, from experiments, that atmo∣spheric air has a stronger affinity to phlogiston than to the matter of heat, so that it unites itself with the greatest readiness to the former, while, at the same time, it sets at liberty the latter, which had been hitherto held in a fixed and latent state.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="164" TYPE="part">
<PB N="123" REF="028310_0137_0FD88255E120F118"/>
<HEAD>§ 164.</HEAD>
<P>When we come to apply the foregoing posi∣tions and principles to the phenomena of respira∣tion, it appears highly probable, that animal heat is generated by a process of a similar nature.</P>
<P>For, as we have already had occasion to ob∣serve, the air which we exspire differs, in a very remarkable degree, from what we had immediately before inspired; being deprived of its igneous portion, or of that part fit for contributing to the support of flame, it is returned highly impreg∣nated, on the contrary, with phlogiston and the base of fixed air. (§ 146.)</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="165" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 165.</HEAD>
<P>It appears, therefore, extremely probable, that the igneous portion of the air we breathe enters those minute blood-vessels, which are every where dispersed throughout the substance of the lungs, and separated from the air-vesicles themselves by nothing more than subtle partitions of the most filmy texture (§ 136); that from the lungs it is conveyed through the pulmonary veins to the aorta, from whence it is again, by means of the arterial system, distributed throughout every part of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="028310_0138_0FD882D1B73099E0"/>During the whole course of this minute distri∣bution, more especially while in the extreme ra∣mifications of the vessels, it appears to be ex∣changed for phlogiston, which it every where meets with in considerable quantities. This phlo∣gistic principle, being thus mixed with the blood, and occupying the place just evacuated by the matter of heat, is conveyed back, by means of the venous system to the right side of the heart, and from thence by the pulmonary artery, into the lungs, where, agreeably to those laws of affinity which we just now hinted at, it is immediately received and taken up by the volume of air recently inspired. In consequence of the accession of this quantity of phlogiston, and its union with the air contained in the lungs, a fresh portion of the element of fire or heat is set at liberty, which instantly enters the blood and is thus incessantly distributed throughout the system in the manner already described.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="166" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 166.</HEAD>
<P>The truth of this theory is evidenced by those diversities between arterial and venous blood, to which we have every where adverted. It is also farther evidenced by the difference between the specific heat of arterial, and that of venous blood; thus the specific heat of the blood con∣tained in the arteries is to that of the blood con∣tained
<PB N="125" REF="028310_0139_0FD88263870397E0"/>
in the veins, as 11½ to 10. Finally, as an additional evidence of the same thing, we might mention, in the last place, that oscillatory action exerted by the smallest order of blood vessels, which was the subject of our attention on a former occasion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="167" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 167.</HEAD>
<P>For it seems altogether probable, that those extremely minute ramifications of the sanguiferous system, are parts of such utility and importance, that in proportion as their action is stronger or weaker, a correspondent increase or diminution takes place in that exchange of the element of fire for the matter of phlogiston, which goes constantly forward in the body, and also in the heat of the animal uniformly generated by such exchange.</P>
<P>Those memorable and striking phenomena, from which it appears, that animal heat (if indeed the matter be determined by a thermometer, and not trusted to the fallacious test of sensation), remains in general at very nearly the same precise point of temperature, little augmented by the summer's blaze, little diminished by the winter's blast; and further, that on certain occasions the heat of our bodies is even increased in consequence of an im∣mersion in cold water—Those phenomena, I say, seem to demonstrate, and reduce it to a certainty,
<PB N="126" REF="028310_0140_0FD88284EA666A78"/>
that according to the variations that take place in the <HI>temperature</HI> of the medium in which we live, corresponding diversities immediately follow in the <HI>action</HI> of the smallest vascular ramifications of our bodies. From this singularly accommodating power, resident in the minute extremities of our vascular system, it follows, that on being exposed to cold (which appears to act by increasing their tone), they are immediately enabled to exchange a <HI>larger quantity</HI> of the principle of phlogiston for the igneous pabulum, and thus generate a higher degree of heat; whereas, on the other hand, they are obliged to exchange a much <HI>smaller quan∣tity,</HI> as often as they are rendered inactive by be∣ing subjected to the influence of a relaxing and debilitating medium.</P>

<P>SO various, and extremely diversified, are the functions of the <HI>cutis,</HI> with which the hu∣man body is invested, that an enumeration and complete account of the whole of them can scarcely be comprehended with propriety under

one and the same head; they would appear to be more fitly arranged for consideration, each one under that <HI>class</HI> of <HI>actions</HI> to which, from its nature it belongs.</P>
<P>For, in the first place, the cutis is the organ of touch, of which we will speak when treating of the <HI>animal functions.</HI></P>
<P>It is again the medium or instrument of <HI>inhala∣tion,</HI> by which office it makes a part of the absorbing system of lymphatics; this shall be a subject of further consideration, when we come to take a view of the <HI>natural functions.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, It is the laboratory or organ of <HI>perspi∣ration</HI> also. This function agrees in a great variety of respects with the process of <HI>respiration,</HI> and appears therefore to be introduced with sufficient propriety as the subject of the present section.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="169" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 169.</HEAD>
<P>The cutis is said to consist of a threefold mem∣brane, or of a membrane composed of three laminae. These laminae or layers are the <HI>corium</HI> or true skin, lying on the interior side, the <HI>cuticula</HI> or cuticle making the exterior covering, and the <HI>reticulum</HI> (i. e. the <HI>rete mucosum</HI>), which is spread
<PB N="128" REF="028310_0142_0FD882D476ED2458"/>
between the two laminae just mentioned. Of each of these we will treat severally and in order.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="170" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 170.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>cuticle,</HI> or epidermis, forms, as just ob∣served, the external covering to the whole body: It is thus, from its situation, exposed to a free ac∣cession of the air, the immediate contact of which element, scarcely any other part of the body can bear with impunity, even in a sound state, except the enamel of the teeth, the tubes of respiration, and the alimentary canal.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="171" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 171.</HEAD>
<P>The texture of the epidermis is simple to the utmost degree, being entirely destitute of vessels, of nerves and of pores. This texture, though on the whole scarcely organic, is nevertheless highly singular and striking; notwithstanding its semipel∣lucid and tender appearance, its tenacity is yet so very considerable as to resist effectually, for a great length of time, not only maceration, but various other modes of generating putrefaction.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="172" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 172.</HEAD>
<P>The origin of this filmy expansion is as yet in∣volved in doubts and difficulties. It is in the mean time, however, probable that it springs, along with the small bulbs surrounding the roots
<PB N="129" REF="028310_0143_0FD882D6A29BC590"/>
of the hairs, from the <HI>corium</HI> or true skin expanded beneath it: that this is the case, we are led to in∣fer, from the myriads of minute and extremely tender fibrils, by which it and the skin are con∣nected together.</P>
<P>When by any means destroyed, it is re-pro∣duced again with greater facility, than any of the other solid parts of the human body.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="173" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 173.</HEAD>
<P>That this membranous lamina is of the utmost importance in the economy of organized bodies, is incontestibly evinced by its universal prevalence throughout both the animal and vegetable king∣doms. It may be observed already formed even in the tender embryo itself, at so early a period as the third month after the time of conception.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="174" TYPE="part">

<P>Underneath the cuticle is expanded a thin mu∣cous membrane, which, from an opinion entertained respecting it, by its celebrated discoverer, is called <HI>reticulum Malpighianum.</HI></P>
<P>This reticulum or subtle net-like expansion, ex∣hibits the habit and appearance of mucus, ex∣tremely easy of solution: it can scarcely in any part, except in the scrotum of Aethiopians, be sepa∣rated

<DIV3 N="175" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 175.</HEAD>
<P>The part now under consideration, constitutes the primary and principal seat of colour in the human race. In all men the true skin is fair and shining; the cuticle also is semipellucid and whitish in all nations, except the inhabitants of Aethiopia, in whom it is more duskish and obscure. But in the human subject after birth, the colour of the <HI>reticulum mucosum</HI> is varied, in correspondence to the diversities of age, mode of life, climate, and also in proportion as the constitution is more or less sound.</P>
<P>Thus, for example, of the five <HI>varieties,</HI> into which the human race appears to me, to be with much propriety divided, the <HI>first</HI> has the reticu∣lum more or less whitish. This description in∣cludes, besides Europeans, those who inhabit the west of Asia, and the north of Africa, together with the natives of Greenland and Esquimaux.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> In the second variety, which includes the inhabitants of all the other parts of Asia, the reti∣culum somewhat tawny, inclining to an olive east.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="131" REF="028310_0145_0FD882DC3B3EF248"/>3<HI>dly,</HI> In the third, which embraces the inhabi∣tants of Aethiopia, it is blackish.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> In the fourth, which consists of the ab∣origines of America, it is to a certain degree cop∣per-coloured.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> Finally, in the fifth, which comprehends the inhabitants of all the South Sea islands, it is more or less tawny or brown.</P>
<P>But all, and each one of those varieties of co∣lour, as well as all other varieties, by which man differs from man, and nation from nation, appear to be so intimately blended together, and are dis∣posed to run into each other with so much facility, that it seems scarcely possible to establish any divi∣sions or classes of them, but such as are plainly arbitrary.</P>

<HEAD>§ 176.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Corium</HI> or <HI>true skin</HI> itself, to which the <HI>reticulum</HI> and epidermis serve as a covering, is a membrane of a peculiar nature; it is porous, te∣nacious, capable of vast dilatation, varied in its de∣grees of thickness, consisting chiefly of condensed cellular membrane, and extremely close and com∣pact on its external superficies; it is more lax on the internal surface, which, (if you except a few
<PB N="132" REF="028310_0146_0FD882DD8AAC3938"/>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="177" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 177.</HEAD>
<P>Besides <HI>nerves</HI> and <HI>absorbents,</HI> of which we will speak particularly on a future occasion, the <HI>corium</HI> or true skin is also plentifully supplied with innu∣merable <HI>small blood-vessels,</HI> which run on its exte∣rior surface, and, as we learn from a successful injection, invest the same with reticular expansion of the most close and subtile texture.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="178" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 178.</HEAD>
<P>Over the same exterior surface is also inter∣spersed an immense assemblage of small <HI>sebace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> follicles,</HI> which thoroughly anoint the whole cutis with a very subtle and limpid oil, of such a nature as not to be easily evaporated and dried up.

<DIV3 N="179" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 179.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, almost the whole of the true skin is planted with <HI>hairs</HI> of various kinds. The most numerous and abundant of these are very short and tender, inclining more or less to the nature of down; of hairs which fall under this description,
<PB N="133" REF="028310_0147_0FD882E0476B1FC8"/>
scarcely any part of the body is destitute, except the eye-lids, the male penis, the palms of the hands, and the soles of the feet. But, on certain parts of the body, the hairs, being destined for particular uses, grow to much greater lengths; examples of this we have in the hair of the head, in the eye-brows, in the eye-lashes, the hairs in the nostrils, the whiskers, the beard, together with such hairs as grow in the arm-pits, and about the anus and parts of generation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="180" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 180.</HEAD>
<P>In general, man is indeed less hairy than most other animals belonging to the class <HI>mammalia.</HI> A difference exists, however, in this respect, be∣tween the inhabitants of different countries. For, to pass in silence over those nations who are in the daily practice of plucking out, as well the beard, as the hairs which appear on other parts of the body, there are not wanting certain tribes, who are naturally destitute of hair; of this descrip∣tion appear to be the Tungusae and the Buratae. On the other hand, we are informed by travellers of the highest reputation in point of veracity, that the inhabitants of Nadigsda, one of the northern Kurilikian islands, are remarkable for the unusual quantities of hair with which their bodies are pro∣tected.</P>

<PB N="134" REF="028310_0148_0FD882E16C024BE0"/>
<HEAD>§ 181.</HEAD>
<P>Neither are the varieties fewer, which are ex∣hibited by the hair, in regard to length, flexility, curliness, and, more especially, in point of colour: this last property depends, in general, on the power of climate, on age, and other causes, which exert their influence in perfect conformity to the esta∣blished laws of nature; but it sometimes also de∣pends on a morbid and misplaced temperament, as appears to be the case in the white natives of Aethiopia. The colour of the hair corresponds, for the most part, to that of the eyes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="182" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 182.</HEAD>
<P>There is also a further peculiarity in the <HI>direc∣tion</HI> of the hairs, on certain parts of the body; thus, for example, on the <HI>vertex</HI> or crown of the head, they pursue a spiral direction; on the pubes, they diverge and point upwards; on the posterior side of the arm, they look, (as on the ape, and contrary to their direction on the satyr), towards the elbow, (that is, they point from the shoulder downwards, and from the wrist upwards): of the directions pursued by the eye-brows and eye-lashes, it seems unnecessary to say any thing on the pre∣sent occasion.</P>

<P>The hairs originate from the interior surface of the true skin, which contains a quantity of face they are fixed with considerable firmness in each of the small bulbs, which are composed of <HI>two in∣volucra</HI>; the external involucrum is vascular, and oval; the internal is cylindrical, appears continu∣ous with the epidermis, and serves as an immedi∣ate covering to those elastic filaments of which each individual hair is itself composed, and which are from five to ten in number.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="184" TYPE="part">

<P>The hairs are always completely besmeared with an oily halitus, and are almost incorruptible. They appear to possess more of the nature of original electrics (or of <HI>electra per se,</HI> as they are called), than any of the other parts of the body. Their nutrition is extremely simple and easy, as is also their re-production after having fallen off, unless the cutis itself be labouring under some morbid affection.</P>

<P>Besides other important purposes which these common integuments of the body serve, they are, in a particular manner, to be reckoned among the number of the <HI>excretory organs</HI> of the system; by
<PB N="136" REF="028310_0150_0FD882E6EB5907D8"/>
their assistance, in this point of view, certain foreign matters, which would from retention prove highly noxious, are hourly eliminated and totally removed from the general volume of our fluids.</P>
<P>The truth of the above position is fully demon∣strated and established, by the well-known circum∣stance of miasmata being completely removed from the system, under the appearance of <HI>exanthemata</HI> or <HI>eruptions;</HI> it is also proved by the odours of garlic, musk, and other substances taken into the body, passing by the skin; it is still further demon∣strated and confirmed by the process of sweating, and by other phenomena of a similar nature.</P>

<P>But above all, those excretory passages convey of a certain fluid, which is called the <HI>perspirable matter</HI> of <HI>Sanctorius,</HI> in honour of that most acute and ingenious philosopher, who instituted the first series of rational inquiries for the express purpose of ascertaining its utility and importance.</P>
<P>It is necessary, however, to observe, that under this appellation, physiologists commonly designate excrementitious matters, which, if not <HI>opposite,</HI> are at least exceedingly <HI>different,</HI> in their natures, and which ought, therefore, to be distinguished from each other with the utmost accuracy and care; as

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> excretion of <HI>sweat,</HI> for instance, from the genuine matter of <HI>perspiration.</HI></P>
<P>The former (<HI>i. e.</HI> the sweaty excretion) is a liquid of an aqueous nature, faltish to the taste, and which scarcely ever issues spontaneously from the healthy body when in a state of tranquility and rest.</P>
<P>But the latter, (viz. the genuine matter of per∣spiration), of which alone we intend to treat on the present occasion, is an aeriform fluid, perman∣ently elastic, and bearing a very striking resem∣blance to that which we exspire by the lungs.</P>

<P>The quantity of this fluid that exhales from the whole <HI>superficies</HI> of the body (which, in an adult human subject of the middle size, amounts by measurement to about fifteen square feet) can scarcely be reduced to accurate calculation.</P>

<P>It was long since discovered, that the nature and quantity of perspiration vary extremely, not only in different persons, but even in the same persons, at different times.

It will appear that there exists between the cutis and lungs a reciprocal consent; so that the one may be supposed capable of assisting and some∣what relieving the other, and even of supplying its place, at least to a certain degree, in case of any accident or derang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt.</P>

<P>In support of this opinion we can adduce the concurrent testimonies of a variety of phenomena, observable not only in a <HI>sound,</HI> but also in a <HI>diseased,</HI> state of the system.</P>
<P>Some of these phenomena are, for example, those leading points, in which the human foetus, as well as that of the other animals belonging to the class mammalia, differ from the incubated chick, or the young of the feathered tribes, while yet enclosed in the <HI>parietes</HI> of the egg.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="028310_0154_0FD882F0E96FC5D8"/>A further evidence in favour of the same opinion, is that singular coldness of certain parts of the body, even in warm blooded animals, (as in the noses of dogs, &amp;c.) which appears to be referred with sufficient propriety, to a less ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gistic action of the small vessels, with which these parts abound.</P>
<P>On the contrary, from an encreased action of the minute vessels in certain parts of the body, we explain, with the utmost fairness and facility, a variety of morbid symptoms, such, for instance, as that singular heat and flushing in the palms of the hands, which occur so frequently, and are so strikingly observable in patients labouring under a hectic fever.</P>
<P>With regard to that <HI>vicarious action</HI> of which we formerly spoke, and by which we said it ap∣peared probable, that the functions of the lungs and cutis lend mutual aid and assistance to each other; that such an action does unequivocally exist, we derive some force of testimony from those phenomena in pathology, where human subjects, after birth, and even after advancing to an adult age, having their lungs almost totally destroyed by a consumption, or highly vitiated by some other contamination, have nevertheless survived such melancholy misfortunes, for a long time, and in

<P>Finally, It does not appear improbable, but that the interior surface of the <HI>alimentary canal,</HI> may also, besides its other primary functions, be perpetually engaged in the performance of a phlo∣gistic process, not unlike that conducted by the <HI>skin</HI> and <HI>pulmonary system.</HI></P>
<P>This canal or tube appears, indeed, to be the only interior part of the body, except the lungs themselves, to which the atmospheric air has free access; but that the air has really free access to the <HI>prima viae,</HI> or <HI>first passages,</HI> as they are called, and that we swallow that elastic fluid in con∣siderable quantities, are matters, much too plain, to stand in need of any proof.</P>

<P>WE come now to treat of another <HI>class</HI> of the functions of the human body, which embraces what we denominated the <HI>animal func∣tions</HI> (§ 63): by means of these, an uninterrupted commerce and intercourse are kept up between the body and the various faculties of the mind. They belong therefore exclusively, (as indeed the name itself plainly imports,) to organised and ani∣mated bodies; but as they pervade the whole animal kingdom more universally than the vital functions, they appear to have an exceedingly just and well founded claim to the epithet, <HI>animal.</HI></P>

<P>The organs which are principally subservient to the exercise of these functions are, the <HI>cerebrum,</HI> the <HI>cerebellum,</HI> and their appendage the <HI>medulla spinalis,</HI> together with the nerves that originate from these three sources. The whole of these organs may, with sufficient propriety, be ar∣ranged under two leading classes, namely, the <HI>Sen∣sorium</HI> and <HI>Nerves.</HI> The former of these em∣braces (if we except the nerves themselves, and those parts which constitute their more immediate origins) all the remainder of that whole system, which forms, more particularly, the <HI>vinculum</HI> or medium of connection, that exists between the offices or functions of the nerves and our nobler part, the faculties of the mind.</P>

<P>On this division is founded that beautiful obser∣vation of the illustrious Sommering, in which he alledges, that the relative magnitude which the two preceding classes of organs bear to one another, corresponds so accurately with the fa∣culties of the mind, that the smaller and less bulky the nerves of animals are, when compared to the size of the other organs or parts which we have comprehended under the denomination of <HI>Sen∣sorium,</HI> the more vigorous and active are the fa∣culties or their minds. In this respect he observes,
<PB N="144" REF="028310_0158_0FD882F7F2025670"/>
that man may be said to possess the largest cere∣brum or brain, if its bulk be compared to the small size of the nerves that originate and proceed from it, but not if its weight be compared with the relative weight of the whole body.</P>

<P>Besides the bony cranium or skull, in which the cerebrum itself is enclosed, it is still farther invested with three involucra or coverings; these are the <HI>dura</HI> and <HI>pia matres,</HI> between which is expanded the third, viz. the <HI>tunica arachnoidea.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="196" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 196.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>dura mater,</HI> which lines, as a periosteum, the cavity of the encephalon, is lengthened out into a variety of partitions or processes. By its falciform process, which is the most prominent and remarkable, it separates from each other, the two hemispheres of the brain; while, by means of that process called the <HI>tentorium,</HI> it forms a partition between the <HI>cerebellum</HI> and the parts situated above it, and thus, by giving support to the posterior lobes of the brain, prevents them from making an undue pressure on the subjacent cerebellum.</P>
<P>Further, the dura mater, by various duplicatures or doublings of its own membrane, forms what are called the <HI>venous sinuses,</HI> while it gives them at
<PB N="145" REF="028310_0159_0FD882F93689C6D8"/>
the same time firmness and support, and prevents them from being unduly compressed. Through these sinuses the blood of the encephalon, or parts contained within the cranium, glides back towards the heart: this blood is said, by physiologists, to possess properties peculiar to itself, and appears, from actual calculation, to be so considerable in quantity as to amount, at least, to one tenth part of the whole mass of blood contained in the human body.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="197" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 197.</HEAD>
<P>Next to the dura mater lies the <HI>tunica arachnoi∣dea,</HI> so called from its extreme tenderness and filmy texture. It is destitute of blood-vessels, (§ 5.), and does not, any more than the dura mater, enter the various <HI>sulci</HI> or furrows, and receive the dif∣ferent eminences or ridges, which mark the sur∣face of the cerebrum, but only expands, with uni∣formity, over the whole volume of that important viscus.</P>

<P>Very different from this is the state and situa∣tion of the internal <HI>involucrum</HI> or covering of the brain, on which the ancients bestowed the name of <HI>pia mater.</HI> This membrane every where ac∣companies the cortical part of the cerebrum so closely, that the innumerable small blood-vessels,

with which it is profusely supplied, enter, and even perforate the cortex itself, with their infini∣tude of minute ramifications; hence, when the <HI>pia mater</HI> is separated by force from the cerebrum, its external surface presents a smooth and exquisitely beautiful polish, while its internal surface, on the contrary, is considerably villous, and resembles, not a little, those delicate radicles by which the mosses adhere to their native soil, or places of growth.</P>

<P>Both the cerebrum and cerebellum are compos∣ed of a variety of parts, different from each other both in texture and figure, the uses of which have been hitherto generally unknown: these parts are particularly distinguished by the four <HI>ventricles,</HI> as they are called, the communication between which has been of late traced and developed, with the utmost accuracy, by the illustrious Monro: of these ventricles, the two anterior and the four<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> contain what are denominated the <HI>plexus choroidei,</HI> the uses and functions of which are also involved, as yet, in intricacy and doubt.</P>

<P>In all parts, of both the cerebrum and cerebel∣lum, there exist two kinds of substance, one of a cincritious or ash-colour, which is called the <HI>corti∣cal</HI> part, although it does not always form the
<PB N="147" REF="028310_0161_0FD882FAA74C7490"/>
exterior stratum, the other white and shining, and therefore called the <HI>medullary</HI> portion. Agree∣ably to the observations of the illustrious Som∣mering, there is interposed between the two fore∣going substances, still a third, of a colour border∣ing on white; this body is most conspicuously ob∣servable in the <HI>arbor vitae</HI> of the cerebellum, and in the posterior lobes of the cerebrum.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="201" TYPE="part">

<P>The proportion, which the cineritious substance bears to the medullary, decreases as life advances; thus, in infants it is greater, in adults less. Almost the whole of this cineritious substance, is com∣posed of an immense assemblage and contexture of the smallest sized blood-vessels, together with vessels of an order still inferior, even so minute as to be incapable of admitting any thing except a white or colourless fluid of the most exquisite tenuity, (§ 79.): a small number of these vessels passes into the medullary portion, which appears to con∣tain in its own composition, (besides these minute vessels and a quantity of very tender cellular mem∣brane), a soft pultaceous parenchyma, in which physiologists, even when armed and aided by the most powerful glasses, have not yet been able to discover any uniform and definite texture.</P>

<P>The primary or nascent origins of the nerves, emerging from the sensorium itself, have, as yet, eluded the most zealous researches of the subtle knife and prying eye of the anatomist: it there∣fore still remains a matter of controversy and doubt, whether the nerves on each side of the body derive their origins from the <HI>corresponding,</HI> or from the <HI>opposite</HI> side of the sensorium?

<P>A certain continuation of the pia mater accom∣panies the medullary part of the nerves in their course, in such a manner, as to form for them a vascular cortex, or covering, of extreme tender∣ness. No sooner, however, do these cords emerge from the cerebrum, or the spinal marrow, than they assume a very singular habit and appearance, by which they may be readily distinguished from almost all the other similar parts of the body. This peculiarity of appearance is produced by small plicae or folds, which they exhibit, running in angular directions, more or less oblique. These folds were formerly described by P. P. Molinel, who compared them, not inconsistently with pro∣priety and fitness, to the rugae of the <HI>lumbricus,</HI> or round worm, or to the small rings of the aspera arteria.</P>

We are, however, in the mean time, most inclined to adopt the opinion formerly entertained respecting these sub∣stances by the ingenious Zinn. That acute phy∣siologist believed the ganglia to consist entirely of mazy complications and intertextures of minute nervous filaments originating from di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ferent sources. In consequence of this intricate and uninvestigated texture of these bodies, he conjectured, that each nervous filament, or thread proceeding from them, participates, or contains in its composition, a part of every filament that enters into their structure, however numerous those filaments may be, or however different the sources from which they originate.</P>

<P>Neither does there appear to exist any very material difference between the nature of ganglia, as just described, and of what are called <HI>plexus nervosi.</HI> These latter are also indebted, for their existence and form, to a similar concurrence and anastomosing intertexture of nerves that originate from different sources. The composition of such nervous filaments as ramify and proceed from these
<PB N="153" REF="028310_0167_0FD8830722DFE6F8"/>

<P>But as the <HI>nascent origins</HI> of the nerves, so like∣wise (with a few exceptions), the <HI>final termina∣tions</HI> of their <HI>extreme ramuli,</HI> or remote filamentary branches, are as yet involved in the depth of ob∣scurity.

<P>Various circumstances and phenomena combine in rendering it probable, that the mind is indeed attached and closely connected to the brain itself.

<P>With respect to that connection of which we have just hinted, I would further observe, that certain physiologists, wantonly sporting in the de∣lusive fields of imagination, have suffered them∣selves to be so far influenced by the form and situation of particular parts of the encephalon, that they have considered, and even endeavoured to prove, sometimes one, sometimes another of these parts, to be indeed the very seat, and royal court, (as it were) of the mind. This honorary and sublime privilege, of affording a sacred seat to our nobler and <HI>immortal part,</HI> some meta∣physical physiologists have been solicitous to bestow on the pineal gland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In favour of the Cartesian hypothesis, some degree of testimony appeared to be derived from the dissections of certain <HI>maniacs,</HI> in whom the pineal gland was found in∣vested with calculous concretions.

<P>We are not by any means to suppose, that the whole energy of the nervous system depends on the encephalon alone; it is also derived in part from the spinal marrow, and even the nerves themselves possess such a degree of inherent or native energy, as is sufficient of itself to throw the muscles into a state of convulsion. This native or exclusive energy of the nerves, appears to be principally supported and preserved by that vas∣cular cortex or covering of those organs, of which we briefly spoke on a former occasion (§ 205). It is, however, a truth which ought not to be for∣gotten, that this inherent power of the nerves themselves is <HI>less,</HI> and that energy, on the con∣trary, which is derived immediately from the encephalon, <HI>greater,</HI> in man, than in other animals, especially such as are supplied with cold blood.</P>

<P>The office of the nervous system appears, in a particular manner, to be two-fold. <HI>First,</HI> by means

of this system, other parts of the body, especially such muscles as are subjected to the influence of the will, are excited to motion; of this function, however, we will treat more fully in another place. But, secondly, the nerves are peculiarly subservient to sensation; whatever sensible impres∣sions are made on the body, they, like active he∣ralds, convey and announce immediately to the sensorium, and there give rise to perception.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="216" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 216.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, the sensorium is evidently possessed of the following very singular faculty or power, viz. that, having received sensible impressions through the medium and agency of certain nerves, it is able to re-act again in its turn, not only on the same nerves, but also on such as are completely different. In testimony of the truth and authen∣ticity of this position, it will be sufficient to men∣tion the action of the retina, when affected by light, on the sensorium, and the re-action of this latter, again, in either constricting or dilating the iris.</P>

<P>When we view the subject in a general light, the various opinions, which have at different times been advanced on this contested point, may be all referred to two leading classes: one of these alleges the action of the nervous system, to de∣pend on a certain oscillatory motion; while the other supposes it to be produced by the motion of a peculiar fluid, respecting the nature of which physiologists, again, hold different opinions. Thus, while some believe this fluid to be animal spirits,
<PB N="159" REF="028310_0173_0FD88312D47CF6F0"/>

<P>Although I am disposed to adopt neither of the above opinions as my own, yet it is proper to observe, that most of the arguments, by which the advocates of either <HI>hypothesis</HI> have endeavoured to invalidate the other, appear to me to be as crude and inconclusive, as they ought to be subtle, inge∣nious and forcible.

<DIV3 N="221" TYPE="part">

<P>If, indeed, our views of the subject be not erro∣neous, the two foregoing opinions may, without impropriety, be united, and thus a third one formed, more plausible, at least, than either of the originals, namely, that a certain nervous fluid does actually exist, and that this fluid is also capa∣ble of motion, and of being thrown into oscillatory vibrations, when subjected to the action and influ∣ence of stimuli.</P>

<P>Not to mention various other evidences, which might be obviously deduced, from the different phenomena of the nervous system, the <HI>structure</HI> of the brain itself, which bears a striking resemblance to <HI>that</HI> of certain secreting viscera, appears indeed to be highly in favour of the existence of a nervous fluid. It is surely a matter too obvious to admit of controversy, that there is no more need of any direct tubes and canals, for the distribution of such a fluid through the nerves, than there is, for the conveyance of a liquid through brown paper, or any other filtre.</P>
<P>The nugatory calculations, respecting the asto∣nishing rapidity, with which the animal spirits have been supposed to hurry through their nervous canals, in all parts of the system, are subjects too hypothetical and visionary to merit our time, or command our attention.</P>

<P>That an oscillation of the nerves does indeed exist, is a position, powerfully supported by a great variety of very striking and pointed physiological phenomena. This oscillation must not, however, be supposed to bear any resemblance to the rude vibrations of tense chords, but is such a subtle, tremulous motion, as may be readily conceived to
<PB N="161" REF="028310_0175_0FD8831B4C233D20"/>
take place in the tender, pulpy substance of the brain. That hearing is excited by an oscillation of a liquid, has been reduced to satisfactory de∣monstration. That an oscillatory motion somewhat similar takes place also, in the act of vision, is (though we should not be willing to repose impli∣cit confidence in the opinions of Leon. Euler) a position founded, at least, on strong probabilities. That the action of the other senses depends also on an oscillatory motion of a similar nature, is an opinion, which was not only embraced by the illustrious Newton <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide ejus Quaestiones ad calcem optices.

<PB N="163" REF="028310_0177_0FD88273D7D7CA50"/>
constitutes the subject of our present consideration. This infinite diversity, which exists between these senses in different individuals, is either natural or acquired, and relates to their greater or less acu∣men or sharpness, their subtlety, or to the manner in which they are affected by similar applications of the same stimuli.</P>

<P>In giving an entire and complete account of the external senses, it appears most proper to begin with <HI>the touch,</HI> this being the one which manifests itself at the earliest period in the human subject after birth. The organ of the sense of touch is expanded over the whole superficies of the body, and is so constituted and formed as to be affected by much the greatest number of the properties of external objects.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="227" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 227.</HEAD>
<P>For we are not only made sensible of certain qualities of substances by means of the touch alone, as of heat, hardness, weight, &amp;c. but there also exist other qualities, such, for instance, as figure, distance, &amp;c. of which we acquire, a much more certain and accurate knowledge by the aid of the touch, though it must be acknowledged that these qualities are at the same time subject to the cognizance of some of the rest of our senses.</P>

<P>The touch is less liable to deception than the other senses; and is capable of becoming, by cul∣tivation and attention, so exquisitely perfect and refined, as to be able to compensate, in a certain degree, for any deficiency in its sister senses, more especially in that of vision.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="229" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 229.</HEAD>
<P>The organ of this sense is indeed the skin in general, concerning the fabric and texture of which we spoke formerly; but those parts that are more immediately subservient to the touch, are the papillae of the <HI>corium</HI> or <HI>cutis vera;</HI> these papillae exhibit various figures in different parts of the body; they are indeed, for the most part, <HI>ver∣rucose,</HI> in other places they are <HI>fungous,</HI> in others <HI>filamentous</HI> or thread-like, &amp;c. under all which ap∣pearances, the extremities of the cutaneous nerves terminate after the manner of small pulpy pencils.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="230" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 230.</HEAD>
<P>But by far the most important and distinguished instruments of the touch are, in particular, <HI>the hands,</HI> the skin of which is impressed with a great number of striking peculiarities. Thus, for ex∣ample, the skin on the palms of the hands, and on each side of the joints of the fingers, is sulcated and completely destitute of hair, for the purpose of
<PB N="165" REF="028310_0179_0FD88322F5E16560"/>
facilitating the folding or doubling up of those parts. The extremities of the singers, on their <HI>internal,</HI> and of the toes, on their <HI>inferior,</HI> sur∣faces, are furrowed with slight and very elegant grooves running in directions more or less spiral: but the former, on the exterior, and the latter on the superior, sides, of their terminations, are pro∣tected from injury by nails.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="231" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 231.</HEAD>
<P>These scutiform <HI>nails</HI> are possessed only by man, and a few other animals, (belonging to the class <HI>mammalia</HI>), which are also furnished with hands, and excel in the acuteness of their sense of touch. These nails appear to be designed for the purpose of making a gentle resistance to the pressure of the fingers when examining substances, and thus aiding their action.</P>
<P>The nails, though of a horny nature, must nevertheless be considered, on the whole, as pro∣ductions or continuations of the epidermis: for immediately under them lies the reticulum muco∣sum, which in Aethiopians is black; and finally, beneath this again is expanded the corium or true skin, which is firmly attached to the periostium of the extreme phalanx of the fingers. Also these constituent parts of the nails are striated in a lon∣gitudinal direction. At their posterior margins
<PB N="166" REF="028310_0180_0FD882788E345E28"/>
(which are distinguished by small semilunar seg∣ments, of a shining or somewhat brilliant ap∣pearance) they are securely fixed in a groove formed by a reflection of the cutis, from whence by a daily, but very moderate, increase, they are gradually protruded forward, in such a manner, as to be completely renovated in every term of about six months.</P>

<P><HI>TASTES</HI> are certain impressions made on, and perceived by, the tongue, and also, in some measure, by the adjoining cutaneous parts of the <HI>os internum (i. e.</HI> the inside of the mouth); these parts are, in particular, the <HI>medium palati,</HI> the fauces, the cheeks, and even the lips themselves; with respect, however, to the whole of these auxiliary parts, it is proper to observe, that they have no perception of any tastes except such as are acrid or intensely bitter.</P>

<P>The principal instrument of taste is <HI>the tongue,</HI> an organ capable of the utmost agility in motion, very pliable, and exceedingly changeable in point of form: it consists of a fleshy texture, which ex∣hibits a striking appearance, somewhat resembling the texture of the heart.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="234" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 234.</HEAD>
<P>It is invested with involucra or coverings, which bear a similitude to the different strata of the cutis: these are, the epithelion, which corresponds to the cuticle, the reticulum Malpighianum, and lastly, a papillary membrane, that differs but little in its structure from the corium or true skin.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="235" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 235.</HEAD>
<P>The principal difference consists in this, that the epithelion, instead of a fine cutaneous oil, is lubricated and moistened by mucus, which exsudes from that imperceptible orifice, named after Mei∣bomius, and also from the rest of that glandular expansion, discovered by Morgagni: another point of difference is, the conformation of the papillae, which are divided into the <HI>pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iolated,</HI> the <HI>obtuse,</HI> and the <HI>conical;</HI> of these, the former, being very few in number, are placed in a lunated arrange∣ment, at the root of the tongue, while the others, being of various sizes, are crouded promiscuously
<PB N="168" REF="028310_0182_0FD883262E8A8530"/>
and without order, on the back of the tongue, but more especially on its edges and tip, where the sense of taste is most acute and exquisite.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="236" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 236.</HEAD>
<P>To these papillae pass the extreme filaments of the lingual branch of the fifth pair of nerves, by the offices and aid of which it appears probable, that the sense of taste is proximately generated and preserved.</P>
<P>For the ninth pair of nerves, and also that branch of the eighth, which is distributed through∣out the ton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue, appear to be subservient to the various motions performed by that organ in chew∣ing, swallowing, speaking, &amp;c. rather than to its function as the immediate instrument of taste.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="237" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 237.</HEAD>
<P>That the tongue may exercise the sense of taste in perfection, it is necessary for it to be kept in a state of complete humidity; the substance to be tasted should also be a liquid, and ought to abound with salts in a state of solution: for if either the tongue itself, or the substances applied to it be dry, it may then indeed examine them by the touch, which it generally possesses in an exquisite degree, but cannot with strictness and propriety be said to taste them.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="028310_0183_0FD88327BA75AED8"/>When the tongue discharges the office of tasting with most perfection and acuteness, the papillae situated on its apex and edges, appear to be brought into a state of genuine, though slight, erection.</P>

<P>BY means of the sense of smelling we perceive impressions made by the odorous effluvia of substances, which being inhaled in inspiration, come in contact with that part, in particular, of the Schneiderian membrane, which invests each side of the septum narium, and lines the convex surfaces of the concha.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="239" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 239.</HEAD>
<P>For although the whole of the internal nares, together with the adjoining sinuses, which open into them, be lined with a humid membrane, similar in appearance to the Schneiderian, it nevertheless appears to be diversied in its nature in different places.</P>
<P>That part of the membrane, which is situated near the opening of the external nares themselves,
<PB N="170" REF="028310_0184_0FD883292D74B800"/>
bearing a stronger resemblance to the other parts of the real cutis, is overspread with sebaceous fol∣licles, which are completely mantled in clusters of hair.</P>
<P>But that part which lines the <HI>septum narium,</HI> and <HI>conchae,</HI> is of a fungous nature, and abounds with small muciferous cryptae or cells.</P>
<P>Finally, Those portions which invest the <HI>parietes</HI> of the frontal, the sphenoidal, the eth∣moidal, and the maxillary sinuses, are by far the most tender and delicate of all, and are completely overspread with an infinitude of minute blood-vessels, which constantly exhale from their ex∣tremities a subtle dew-like fluid of an aqueous nature.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="240" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 240.</HEAD>
<P>The principal, if not, indeed, the only use of those <HI>sinuses</HI> appears, therefore, to be, to furnish a watery liquid, of such a nature, as has been just described, which being first conveyed into the three passages or avenues of the nares, may be from thence communicated to those adjacent parts, which, we have already said, constitute the imme∣diate instruments of the sense of smelling. By thus supplying, with a due degree of humidity, the parts which proximately form the olfactory
<PB N="171" REF="028310_0185_0FD8827B51ABAE80"/>
organs, those sinuses contribute, not a little, to preserve the acuteness and perfection of this in∣teresting sense.</P>
<P>For the attainment of this end, such a wise pro∣vision is made by the very situation of those several sinuses, that in whatever position the head be suffered to rest, one or other of them may still discharge and deposit a quantity of this subtle dew, on the immediate seat of the sense of smelling.</P>

<P>In new-born infants, the chamber destined for the immediate reception of odours is narrow, and as yet extremely imperfect.

<P>The remaining portion of the internal cavity of the eye, is filled up by an exceedingly limpid <HI>aqueous humour,</HI> and, by the expanded orbicular curtain of the iris, is divided into two <HI>chambers:</HI> these are, the anterior, or more capacious cham∣ber, which separates the cornea from the iris, and the posterior one, of smaller dimensions, extending from the uvea to the <HI>corpus ciliare.</HI></P>

called the eyes, are securely protected from ex∣ternal injuries, as well by their recluse situations in their orbits, as by their valviform coverings, the <HI>palpebrae.</HI></P>
<P>Between the folds of the <HI>palpebrae</HI> are planted, in immense profusion, the crouded sebaceous fol∣licles of Meibomius; their <HI>extreme</HI> or <HI>lower</HI> edges, fringed with three or four phalanges of <HI>cilia</HI> or lashes, are kept in an expanded state by certain cartilages called <HI>tarsi,</HI> which are also of further service in facilitating the motion of the palpebrae on the eye-balls.</P>
<P>But (to adopt the language of the eloquent Cicero) the parts situated immediately above the palbebrae, being closely mantled in the <HI>supercilia</HI> or <HI>eye-brows</HI> intercept and turn aside the sweat flowing down in streamlets from the head and face, and also serve to moderate, in a certain degree, the excessive effulgence of light.</P>

<P>For the purposes of lubricating the eyes, of preserving their splendor, and of washing out he∣terogeneous substances, <HI>the tears</HI> are provided: the principal source of this fluid is a small conglo∣merate gland, deeply situated in a depression to∣wards the external part of the circumference of
<PB N="185" REF="028310_0199_0FD88332A8216060"/>
the orbit. The excretory ducts belonging to this gland are numerous, but extremely tender; they are supposed to convey, from both eyes, in the course of twenty-four hours, about two ounces of tears; After having been excreted, the tears are again absorbed by the <HI>puncta lacrymalia,</HI> from whence they are conducted through what are called the <HI>cornua limacum,</HI> or <HI>snail's horns,</HI> to the lachrymal sac, and from thence finally discharged into the lowermost passage of the nares.</P>

<P>Thus much it was necessary to premise respect∣ing the admirable structure of the visual organ. We come now to treat of the functions of this organ, or, in other words, to consider the <HI>doctrine</HI> of vision.</P>
<P>All the rays of light which fall on the convex surface of the cornea pass through it, provided their angle of incidence be less than that of 48 degrees. In consequence, not only of the den∣sity, but also the figure of the aqueous humour, the rays are refracted in that medium, and turned a little nearer to the real axis.</P>
<P>As many of the rays as, having passed through the pupil, enter the crystalline lens, must neces∣sarily,
<PB N="186" REF="028310_0200_0FD8835641F28518"/>
in this more dense medium, be subjected to a still higher degree of refraction.</P>
<P>But by means of the more attenuated and less refractive vitreous medium, wise provision is made to prevent these rays from uniting in a focal point at too short a distance: this point, being thus farther removed from the convex surface of the cornea, falls on the <HI>retina,</HI> and there exhibits, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an inverted position, the images of all objects presented, and that in perfect correspondence to the nature of surrounding and attendant circum∣stances.</P>

<P>This difference in the density of the refracting media of the eye, exhibits a very striking instance of the exquisite and inimitable workmanship of the divine creator. By means of this diversity, such a complete remedy is provided against the two-fold separation or divergency of the rays of light, (the one arising from the different refrangibility of the different coloured rays, the other from the very figure of the lenses), that they are all finally collected and united in the same focal point.</P>

<P>The celebrated problem, in which the cause is demanded, wherefore we see those objects erect,

the images of which are nevertheless exhibited in an inverted position on the retina? appears to admit of an easy solution, when we consider, that objects are said to be inverted, only from the relation they bear to others, which are exhibited in an erect position.</P>
<P>In as much then as the images, not of a few, but of all objects, even of our own bodies, are received by the retina in the same relative position, the situations and relations of the whole of them harmonize and correspond to one another, equally as well, as they could possibly have done, had their positions been truly erect: in consequence of this, the mind, (which does not attend to the image itself, but to the sensation excited by its impression), is sufficiently guarded against embar∣rassment and mistake.</P>

<P>In as much as the conditions, essentially neces∣sary for the purposes of acute and distinct vision, are extremely numerous and varied, the creator of man has made the wisest provision for these, by endowing the part, subservient to this sublime sense, with a great variety of functions.</P>
<P>As a certain <HI>adequate,</HI> but yet <HI>definite,</HI> quantity, and not too potent a <HI>glare,</HI> of light, is essential
<PB N="188" REF="028310_0202_0FD8835929EA9F10"/>
to the existence of clear and per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fold caution is thus taken; first, to admit, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cording as the light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger or weaker) a greater or less column of rays to fall on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and secondly, that all superfluous rays which enter the eye, and tend only to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zzle by the intensity of their splendour, be absorbed and rendered inactive.</P>
<P>The former of these purposes is effectually ac∣complished by the motion of the iris; the latter, by means of the black pigment.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="271" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 271.</HEAD>
<P>The iris possesses an astonishing mobility, by which it accommodates itself so perfectly to the quantity of light acting on it, that when exposed to a more intense glare, it is immediately expanded, and thus diminishes the size of the pupil, but wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subjected to the action of a weaker light, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again retracted, and the pupil consequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦larged.</P>
<P>Physiologists have attempted a satisfactory ex∣planation of this motion, in a variety of mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, founded on different principles; by some it has been derived from diversified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lses of the blood on the tender vessels of the moving part, while others have figured to themselves the existence of
<PB N="189" REF="028310_0203_0FD8846AE911AC00"/>
certain imaginary muscles in the <HI>iris,</HI> and have committed to them the whole of the phenomenon in question, &amp;c. But I have lately made it appear in a separate paper, that neither of these modes of explanation is well founded, but that it is much more agreeable to evidence, and correspondent to the phenomena of nature, to derive the immediate cause of the motion of the iris from its <HI>vita pro∣pria,</HI> or <HI>specific life.</HI> (§ 47.) The more remote cause of this motion, as we observed on a former occasion (§ 250), cannot be referred to any other source, than the re-action of the sensorium itself.</P>

<P>The function of this dusky pigment, of which we have already so repeatedly spoken (§ 256, 259 261,) to wit, that it is destined to absorb the superfluous rays of light, and is hence of the utmost importance in the business of perfect vision, may, besides other arguments, be safely inferred from dissections of the eyes of various animals; but is more completely demonstrated and estab∣lished, by the morbid constitution of the white Aethiopians, or <HI>Albinos,</HI> as they are called, in whom, from a deficiency of this pigment, the organs of vision are painfully tender, and the im∣pulse of light consequently too powerful to be borne.</P>

<PB N="190" REF="028310_0204_0FD8835AA726B480"/>

<P>It is further requisite, that the focus of re∣fracted rays be perfectly formed on the retina, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that it may strike the very <HI>point</HI> of vision, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> neither so far extended as to fall behind it, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much contracted as to terminate before it, in the vitreous substance.</P>
<P>The latter of these deviations from perfect vision is what takes place in those individuals called <HI>myopes,</HI> in whom the lucid cornea is rather too convex and gibbous.</P>
<P>But the former deviation is that under which the <HI>presbytae</HI> labour, as the conformation of the anterior parts of the eyes is directly the reverse.</P>

<P>But as an eye perfectly sound is able to discern, with equal distinctness, bodies, whether at a greater or less distance, it must, without doubt, be furnished with peculiar faculties or powers of accommodating itself to the various distances of objects. That these internal and accommodating changes of the eye, are in a great measure pro∣duced by the pressure of the <HI>recti</HI> muscles on the ball which they embrace, is a position so clear, and apparently well founded, as scarcely to admit of a doubt. Besides other arguments which might
<PB N="191" REF="028310_0205_0FD8835C286C4C10"/>
be advanced in favour of this opinion, I am induced to adopt it in consideration of the very singular structure, and extreme flexility, of the <HI>sclerotica,</HI> in the eye of the Greenland phoca, or sea-calf. By this peculiarity of fabrication and arrangement, nature has made the most exquisite provision to enable this amphibious animal to enjoy at all times, the advantages of vision, though passing its life alternately in media of very different densities.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="275" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 275.</HEAD>
<P>By means of these same muscles, our eyes, whilst we are awake, are perpetually agitated, although with an almost insensible motion, and so directed as to have their visual axes arranged in right lines with the objects viewed. For although the whole of the retina be possessed of sensibility, yet it is not in every part equally well adapted to receive the images of objects.</P>
<P>For at the genuine axis of the eye-ball, in the place, for example, where the optic nerve enters, it appears, from the well-known and celebrated experiment of Mariotte, that the human eye is destitute of the power of vision.</P>
<P>But the <HI>principal focus</HI> of the retina, and that which ought to be considered as the leading and
<PB N="192" REF="028310_0206_0FD88334CCD4DDC8"/>
immediate instrument of distinct vision, is situated in an imaginary axis of the eye-ball, which is sup∣posed to pass through the centre of the cornea, and to be thus continued through the centre of the whole orb. It is not, however, (as was lately observed by the celebrated Kaestner in his com∣ments on certain works of Boerhaave), to be from hence understood, that we are unable to set cle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly and distinctly, more than one single point of an object while the eye remains perfectly at rest, and that we are obliged to shift or alter its axis in order to distinguish any other point. The case is quite otherwise, because the sensation pro∣duced by one entire object, is also itself, like its original, or exciting cause, one and entire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="276" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 276.</HEAD>
<P>The habit of directing the axis of the eye with dispatch and facility towards the object of vision, is finally acquired only by use and daily exercise. That this is a position founded in truth, is demon∣strated not only by the example of such individuals as, having been born blind, acquired afterwards the power of vision in adult age, but also by that of tender infants, who seldom attain to this happy facility of moving their eyes previously to the third month after birth.</P>

<PB N="193" REF="028310_0207_0FD88352699E4FE8"/>
<HEAD>§ 277.</HEAD>
<P>To the same power of custom and habit, must we also attribute the remarkable circumstance of our seeing objects only single, though our eyes be two in number. New-born infants appear to see objects double, and double vision, which fre∣quently continues sometime after certain diseases of the eyes, may be at length overcome and re∣moved by use and exercise.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="278" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 278.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>joint power</HI> of both eyes, with regard to the <HI>acumen</HI> and strength of vision, does not, according to the calculation of Jurin, exceed that of one eye, more than a thirteenth part.</P>
<P>And, agreeably to an observation, long since made by that celebrated painter Leon. da Vinci, it is much best in judging of the distances of objects to make use of one eye only.</P>

<DIV3 N="279" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 279.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, In treating of the strength and per∣fection of the eye, our former illustrious country∣man, Tob. Mayer, demonstrated, by a series of very elegant and ingenious experiments, that the angle of vision ought to exceed, in dimensions, at least 34 <HI>seconds</HI> of a degree. From hence he at the same time illustrated and proved the extreme
<PB N="194" REF="028310_0208_0FD8835DA8336D78"/>
perfection of the human eye, because this extent of the angle of vision may continue nearly the same, under any light whatever, whether that of the meridian sun, or that of a weak lamp, so that though the window or pupil of the eye be greatly contracted and diminished, yet the clearness of vision can, from that source, be scarcely in any degree affected.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="280" TYPE="part">

<P>From hence we may infer, the inconceivable smallness of the images of objects which are thrown and delineated on the retina, and which are never∣theless impressed with so much force, that, under certain circumstances, vestiges of them remain a considerable time, even after the objects them∣selves have been entirely removed from the eye.</P>

<P>THROUGH the medium of those ex∣ternal senses, of which we have hitherto treated, ideas are conveyed to our nobler part, <HI>the mind;</HI> for, agreeably to the tenor and spirit of a well-known theorem, nothing can enter the under∣standing save by the route or avenue of the senses.</P>

<P>For the purposes of receiving and preserv∣ing the ideas thus acquired, by the aid of the senses, and also for making the best use and im∣provement of the intellectual stock received, va∣rious faculties of the mind contribute their united exertions. Though these faculties be, (as we have already had occasion to observe, § 42.), widely different from the vital energies which reside in the body, nevertheless, by means of the nervous system, they are so closely connected with those corporeal energies, that an astonishing in∣tercourse is thus established and supported between the body and mind, (§ 211.)</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="283" TYPE="part">
<PB N="196" REF="028310_0210_0FD8835F2DAE7158"/>
<HEAD>§ 283.</HEAD>
<P>The first of those powers, possessing indeed, apparently, the lowest grade, is the faculty of <HI>perception,</HI> by means of which the mind is ren∣dered conscious of impressions made on the dif∣ferent organs of sense.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="284" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 284.</HEAD>
<P>This faculty is aided by another, of better rank and higher dignity, namely, <HI>attention,</HI> which so directs and determines the mind towards any idea when once excited, as to rivet its thoughts to that object alone.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="285" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 285.</HEAD>
<P>For the important purposes of preserving ideas, which have been already perceived, of re-exciting them, and associating them into more lively and picturesque species of imagery, two other faculties, called <HI>internal senses,</HI> are brought into action: these are <HI>memory</HI> and <HI>imagination,</HI> two powers, which, though nearly allied to each other, may, notwithstanding, be readily distinguished by the following characters: <HI>memory</HI> appears to be more subservient to, and engaged in, the reception and retention of <HI>arbitrary signs</HI> of things; whereas, <HI>imagination,</HI> on the contrary, wakes up rather the <HI>very images</HI> of things, bestows on them form and colouring, and marshals them under the view of
<PB N="197" REF="028310_0211_0FD88360A7048E50"/>
the mind, as if the objects themselves were again actually present: this faculty is more particularly and powerfully exercised on such objects as are calculated to excite sensations of pleasure or disgust.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="286" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 286.</HEAD>
<P>Upon the whole, the <HI>faculty</HI> of <HI>choosing</HI> and <HI>refusing,</HI> and, (when we consider the matter a little more minutely), even the foundation of the whole <HI>will</HI> itself, appear to rest and depend en∣tirely on certain agreeable and disagreeable varie∣ties of sensation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="287" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 287.</HEAD>
<P>From the same prolific source, namely, the <HI>imagination,</HI> are also to be derived the <HI>affections</HI> or <HI>commotions</HI> of the mind, to which we see dif∣ferent individuals variously subjected, in confor∣mity to the countless diversities of existing tempe∣raments (§ 59.) The very intimate and instan∣taneous consent of these affections with certain functions of the body, appears strikingly evident in an infinitude of examples; thus, for instance, there is scarcely a single passion of the mind, which does not possess considerable influence over the <HI>motion</HI> of the heart, the <HI>appetite</HI> for food, and the powers of <HI>digestion,</HI>—not to descend to a minute specification of particular effects, such, for exam∣ple, as the action of shame in giving rise to
<PB N="198" REF="028310_0212_0FD8836261FA74B0"/>
<HI>blushing,</HI> the action of love or hatred on the <HI>organs</HI> which serve to distinguish the sexes, the action of anger on the <HI>secretion</HI> of bile, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>While speaking of the effects produced in the economy of the human body, by the commotions of the mind, it is proper to observe, that they may be divided into <HI>stimulant</HI> and <HI>sedative,</HI> or into those which <HI>excite,</HI> and those which <HI>depress.</HI></P>
<P>Of the former description are joy, love, hope, anger, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Of the latter, fear, sorrow, nostalgia, and other species of permanent desire or longing, terror, envy, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="288" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 288.</HEAD>
<P>Those faculties of the mind hitherto enume∣rated, are observed to exist in brutes as well as man, though the latter undoubtedly possesses them in by far the highest degrees of strength and per∣fection: thus, for example, in none of the interior animals do we discover a memory so extensive in its range, and so powerful in its tenacity; in none do we discover such a splendid brilliancy, and glowing warmth of imagination; in none do we discover such an unbounded, and sometimes fatal, vehemence of mental passions, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The leading prerogative of the human mind, consists in this, that it alone possesses the exclusive power of <HI>reason,</HI> by means of which it is able to judge, to form abstract ideas, &amp;c. and which exerts also the greatest influence over most of the other faculties of the mind. In place of this divine power, other animals are endowed with various <HI>instincts,</HI> or blind and involuntary <HI>impulses,</HI> which lead them to the performance of such actions, as are suitable to their several economies and modes of life. Of these instinctive impulses man, on the other hand, is furnished with scarcely any, save that which prompts him to participate in venereal gratifications.</P>

<P>The immense and striking difference between <HI>animal instinct</HI> and <HI>human reason,</HI> will appear glaring as the noon-day light to him who considers:</P>
<P>That instincts are faculties co-eval with birth, whereas, on the other hand, the use of reason is acquired only by culture and education:</P>
<P>That instincts remain stationary, and admit of no improvement, whereas the expansive improve∣ment and exercise of reason, are literally free from circumscription:</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="028310_0214_0FD8837DE70E4A80"/>That instincts are suited only to the destined mode of life, to the climate, &amp;c. of each species of animals, and, on this account, are not adequate to the exigencies of man, who, confined to no climate, exclusively restricted to no mode of life, is destined to be an inhabitant of the world at large: from which boundless and splendid prero∣gative, an inconceivable diversity of wants arise, which simple instinct is too weak!—far too weak to supply! b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, the powers of reason, from resources equally diversified as the emergencies themselves, are able to satisfy, in the most ample and complete manner.</P>
<P>Lastly, another high prerogative of man, de∣pending on the powers and exercise of his reason, is the use of speech, of which we have briefly spoken on a former occasion (§ 154.)

<HEAD>§ 291.</HEAD>
<P>THE nerves, as we have already seen, are so constituted as to perform two different functions (§ 215), namely, <HI>sensation</HI> and <HI>motion.</HI> The doctrine of the former we have already con∣sidered. It yet remains to add a few observations on the subject of the latter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="292" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 292.</HEAD>
<P>The motions in general of the several parts of the human body, are usually divided into two classes, one of which is excited and governed by the <HI>power</HI> of the <HI>will,</HI> while the other is not in any measure subject to its <HI>influence,</HI> or controul.</P>
<P>For examples of the latter class, physiologists commonly refer to the harmonious action of the heart, and likewise to the peristaltic motion of the intestines and certain other viscera, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="028310_0216_0FD8837F67A2ED48"/>Instances of the former class we have in the motions of by far the greater part of the other muscles of the body.</P>
<P>Doubts are still entertained, with respect to the real nature of certain motions which take place in the human system; such as the motions in respira∣tion, in sneezing, in the tension of the <HI>membrana tympani,</HI> &amp;c. These are by some classed with the voluntary, by others with the involuntary, while others again refer them to a third class, called <HI>mixed motions.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="293" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 293.</HEAD>
<P>When this division, however, is considered with a little more steadiness and attention, it is easily perceived to be embarrassed with such momen∣tous difficulties, that it is scarcely possible to ascertain, and mark, with definitude, the precise limits between the classes.</P>
<P>For, on the one hand, a few of the functions of our bodies, over which the will, unassisted by other powers, may be said to possess no command at all, may notwithstanding be excited and brought into action, when the imagination and passions of the mind act in concert with the will.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="028310_0217_0FD88380E7017D28"/>On the other hand there are not wanting instances of muscular functions, which, though naturally subject to the immediate command of the will, have, notwithstanding, been rendered in a great measure <HI>involuntary,</HI> by the plastic power of <HI>custom,</HI> (the influence and energetic agency of which, on animal motions, are indeed of the utmost moment and importance.)</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="294" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 294.</HEAD>
<P>Of this latter description are those kinds of muscular motion, which, although at other times subject to the controul of the will, yet, under certain circumstances, take place not only without the consciousness, but even contrary to the incli∣nation of the mind.</P>
<P>Thus, for example, we wink <HI>contrary</HI> to our determination, when the finger of a friend is hastily approached towards our eye, although it does not touch it; and in most persons, the flexion of the little finger is usually attended with a syn∣chronous flexion of the ring finger, though a de∣termination had been formed to preserve the latter entirely unbent.</P>
<P>Without the <HI>consciousness</HI> of the mind we fre∣quently move our limbs, even when wrapt in the most prosound sleep.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="028310_0218_0FD8838279CFD1E8"/>There are, on the other hand, examples of muscles, which, although for the most part per∣fectly obedient to the will, yet in certain cases refuse to obey its commands. To this head we may refer the difficulty of describing, by syn∣chronous movements, circles in contrary directions, with the hand and foot of the same side, together with other motions of a similar nature, which, although truly voluntary, and extremely easy when practised alone, are, notwithstanding, per∣formed with the utmost difficulty, if an attempt be made to associate them with certain other motions.</P>

<P>With respect to the pulsation of the heart, a very remarkable account stands on record of a British colonel, who possessed a power of sus∣pending, at pleasure, the motion of both the heart and arteries. In confirmation of the truth of this, we have the public testimony of Baynard and Cheyne, two physicians of the highest reputation
<PB N="205" REF="028310_0219_0FD88385E12AB518"/>
and veracity, who were themselves witnesses to the astonishing phenomenon.</P>
<P>That the motion of the stomach may be volun∣tary, (as indeed the process of rumination in general seems to evince), I had once an oppor∣tunity of ascertaining, to my entire satisfaction, in a ruminating human subject, in whom this retrogade or reverted motion of the stomach, was under the most perfect subjection to the command of the will.</P>
<P>Although the motion of the iris be involuntary, in by far the greater part of the human race, I have, notwithstanding, been favoured with an account, sufficiently authenticated, of a man, who possessed a power of voluntary command over this membrane, in such a manner, as to be able, by a very singular effort, to contract the pupil of the eye even in a weak and dull light.</P>
<P>There are indeed a great variety of motions, which, though generally performed without the influence of the mind, are nevertheless voluntary in certain individuals, especially if a high degree of attention, and a vigorous effort of imagination be excited. Thus, I have known men, who were able at any moment, to produce and exhibit on themselves a spasmodi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipilation of the skin,
<PB N="206" REF="028310_0220_0FD88386E7DCD198"/>
and also to renew and completely revive i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves the ideas or perception of certain disa∣greeable sensations.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="296" TYPE="part">

<P>Perhaps those phenomena may be satisfactorily explained from the <HI>re-action</HI> of the <HI>sensorium,</HI> which appears to be indeed as powerfully excited by means of the imagination waking up and exhibiting before it, the <HI>image</HI> of an active stimulus, as by the <HI>stimulus itself,</HI> when impressing it by its actual presence. There are indeed an infinitude of phenomena of the animal economy, which admirably correspond to this explanation; as the various causes, for example, which excite erections of the male penis, &amp;c.</P>

<P>With regard to voluntary motions in general, it may be proper finally to observe, that they are among the primary and leading characteristics which serve to distinguish the animal from the vegetable kingdom; for, as on the one hand, a <HI>power</HI> of <HI>voluntary</HI> motion is never observed to be possessed by any plant, so on the other, such a power constitutes an essential attribute of even the most simple and imperfect genera of animals.</P>

<P>In our own systems, the voluntary motions fur∣nish the most full and striking evidence, of that intimate and truly astonishing harmony, which subsists between the mind and the body. Of the existence of this harmony every one will be con∣vinced, who considers with attention, the amazing celerity with which such diversied motions succeed each other, in the fingers of an able and skillful performer on the violin, or in our organs of speech, while we are engaged in conversation.</P>

<DIV3 N="299" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 299.</HEAD>
<P>THE immediate organs of by far the greater number of the motions of our bodies, are the muscles, which constitute the principal portion and bulk of what are called <HI>partes similares.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="300" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 300.</HEAD>
<P>The muscles are, however, distinguished, in a particular manner, from the rest of the similar parts, by a two-fold characteristic; <HI>one</HI> depending
<PB N="208" REF="028310_0222_0FD88388AC0B1DB0"/>
on their texture; and the <HI>other</HI> of a very singular nature, derived from their vital energy.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="301" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 301.</HEAD>
<P>Their texture is fleshy, composed of a peculiar set of fibres, of a very pale red colour: they are so joined together, that every muscle consists, in the first place, of fibrous cords, these cords again, of smaller bundles of fibres, which bundles, by a still further progressive division, may be finally separated and resolved into fleshy fibres and fibrils of inconceivable minuteness.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="302" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 302.</HEAD>
<P>Each muscle is inclosed in a cellular sheath or covering, which, passing into the very substance of the muscle, appears to be interwoven through∣out the whole of its volume, and thus forms par∣titions, first between the larger <HI>lacerti,</HI> then be∣tween the smaller fasciculi or bundles, and lastly, between the fibres and more minute fibrils them∣selves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="303" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 303.</HEAD>
<P>Besides this cellular expansion, the whole tex∣ture of the muscles is also interspersed with an infinitude of blood-vessels and nervous filaments; of these, the <HI>latter</HI> appear to deliquate into an inscrutable pulp, and to be thus very intimately
<PB N="209" REF="028310_0223_0FD88389E79DC110"/>
blended along with the muscular fibres; but the <HI>former</HI> are so extensively and minutely interwoven among those very tender fibres, as to paint the whole of the fleshy parts with that beautiful crim∣son dye, by which they are uniformly characterised. When these are thoroughly washed, they are again restored to their native colour, which, as already observed (§ 301.), is somewhat pale.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="304" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 304.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, a circumstance common to most of the muscles is, that they terminate in <HI>tendons</HI>—parts, which, though likewise of a fibrous texture, are notwithstanding so extremely different, with respect to colour, structure, elasticity, &amp;c. that their entire disagreement from both the preceding kinds of fibres, is very easily ascertained and demonstrated. Hence, therefore, we are enabled successfully to refute the opinion of those physiologists, who have erroneously supposed, that the <HI>tendinous,</HI> are no∣thing more than mere continuations of the <HI>muscu∣lar</HI> fibres. To the adoption of this opinion, they have been inadvertently led by attending to the following phenomenon, observable in the muscles of infants; namely, if we compare the <HI>muscular parts,</HI> of these tender subjects, with <HI>those</HI> of adults, we will find the proportion of flesh, to that of tendon, greater in the former than in the latter.</P>

<HEAD>§ 305.</HEAD>
<P>The other exclusive characteristic of muscles, which we have mentioned (§ 300.) is, the <HI>irrita∣bility</HI> of Haller. Although we endeavoured, on a former occasion, to give a general view of this vital energy, and to ascertain the difference be∣tween it and <HI>contractility,</HI> (§ 44.), yet it may not be improper, at present, to pursue the inquiry a little further.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="306" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 306.</HEAD>
<P>This irritability, otherwise called <HI>vis muscularis, vis insita,</HI> or <HI>vis propria,</HI> is indeed common to all the muscular parts of our bodies, but does not reside in all of them in the same degree, some parts being observed to possess a much higher propor∣tion of it than others.</P>
<P>The principal seat of this energy, where it most plentifully abounds, is the hollow muscles, sub∣fervient to the vital and natural functions: of these muscles, the heart, as was observed formerly (§ 119.), possesses the highest degree of the <HI>cha∣racteristic</HI> now under consideration: of this last mentioned organ, the internal surface, in parti∣cular, is endowed with the most exalted degree of life, and is by far the most tenacious of irrita∣bility.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="028310_0225_0FD88341946E4920"/>Next to the heart, in point of this prerogative, is the intestinal canal, more especially that portion of it which constitutes what are called the <HI>small intestines:</HI> in warm-blooded animals, this part of the tube sometimes contracts on being irritated, even after the heart itself has become incapable of motion.</P>
<P>Next in degree is the stomach,—next, the uri∣nary bladder, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Among the remaining muscles of the system, irritability resides, again, in a very striking degree, in those actively concerned in the function of respiration, as the diaphragm, the intercostals, and the <HI>triangularis sterni.</HI></P>
<P>Next in order to these are the various other muscles of the body.</P>
<P>The arteries doubtless possess irritability, though in a degree far inferior to what exists in the parts just mentioned (§ 123.)</P>
<P>This vital energy resides also in the trunks of veins contained in the thorax, (§ 84.)</P>
<P>In a degree <HI>still lower,</HI> does it exist, in the other parts of the sanguiferous veins, if, indeed, those
<PB N="212" REF="028310_0226_0FD883CFA7A300D0"/>
parts can be said to possess any <HI>genuine irritability</HI> at all (§ 128.)</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="307" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 307.</HEAD>
<P>Haller himself, that illustrious defender of the doctrine now under consideration, appears to me to have, without sufficient foundation, attributed irritability to <HI>certain parts</HI> of the body, which are found, indeed, on experiment, to be endowed with <HI>contractility</HI> (§ 50 seq.), but in which I have never been able to discover any indubitable testi∣monies of genuine <HI>irritability.</HI></P>
<P>Among these parts may be reckoned the lacteal veins, the small glands, the gall-bladder, the uterus, the <HI>dartos</HI> covering, and the male penis.</P>
<P>On no better foundation, in my opinion, is irri∣tability attributed, by others, to the iris, to the external surface of the lungs, &amp;c. in all which parts (if, indeed, I be capable of judging rightly), there exists no more of this vital energy, than there does in the common cellular membrane, and parts composed of it, such, for instance, as the common integuments, the meninges, the pleura, the peritoneum, the periosteum, the medullary membrane, the tendons, the aponeuroses, &amp;c.; or than there does in those viscera composed of genuine <HI>parenchyma,</HI> (§ 27.), such as the liver,
<PB N="213" REF="028310_0227_0FD883D224440EC0"/>
the spleen, the kidneys, the secundines, the brain, with the rest of the nervous system, &amp;c. all which parts, as they are throughout, completely destitute of muscular fibres, so are they likewise destitute of irritability, which resides in muscular fibres alone.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="308" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 308.</HEAD>
<P>As we have, thus, on the one hand, seen muscular <HI>irritability</HI> now and then confounded with cellular <HI>contractility,</HI> so on the other, certain celebrated characters have lately been desirous of ascertaining and establishing an identity between <HI>irritability</HI> and the <HI>vis nervea.</HI></P>
<P>For although we can neither deny the power∣ful influence of the nerves on <HI>muscular motion,</HI> (of which we will speak a few words presently), nor exhibit the smallest fibril of muscular flesh, per∣fectly destitute of the pulp of evanescent nerves, yet these circumstances are not sufficiently mo∣mentuous to compel us to a dereliction of the opinion, that irritability is, in its own nature, as widely and essentially different from the <HI>vis nervea</HI> as it is from <HI>contractility.</HI> On the one hand, this energy is wanting in all parts not muscular, although they be supplied with the utmost profu∣sion of nerves, as the skin, all the nervous viscera, &amp;c.; whereas, on the other, we are not able to produce any portion of true muscular flesh, where
<PB N="214" REF="028310_0228_0FD883476FECC0C8"/>
the genuine and obvious phenomena of irritability do not exhibit themselves. From a close and impartial consideration of the foregoing argu∣ments, besides a great number of others which might be advanced, it appears more consonant to reason and sound induction, to attribute the singular <HI>phenomena</HI> of irritability to the equally singular texture of muscular fibres, than to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them to the nerves, which, in so many other pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the body, are as minutely distributed as they are through the muscles, and yet do not generate and exhibit, in those parts, the faintest shadow of real irritability. I say nothing of the weighty argu∣ments which might be drawn from the following well-founded position, viz. that no steady propor∣tional relation is observed to exist, between the degree of irritability in any part of the body, and the quantity of nerves with which it is supplied.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="309" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 309.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the extreme terminations of the nerves, which are well known to exert an influence over the muscles, the following appears to be the most rational conclusion, viz. that they may be considered as <HI>remote</HI> or <HI>exciting</HI> causes of mus∣cular motion, but should not be confounded with the <HI>proximate</HI> or <HI>efficient</HI> cause, which is indeed <HI>irritability</HI> alone, and that residing exclusively in the muscular fibres.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="028310_0229_0FD883D3F372CAA8"/>The passions of the mind, for example, act on the sensorium, this again re-acts on the nerves of the heart, in such a manner, as to excite its irrita∣bility, and thus produce palpitations and other irregular motions of this organ.</P>
<P>The will acts on the sensorium, this re-acts again on the nerves of the arm, these nerves in like manner operate immediately as remote causes in exciting muscular motion, which, notwith∣standing, depends ultimately for its existence on irritability itself.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="310" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 310.</HEAD>
<P>This distinction, of the two kinds of causes which concur in the production of muscular motion, is indeed fully authorised and sanctioned by actual experiments: from a variety of these it appears, that certain parts of the animal system have been oftentimes rendered paralytic, by cutting, or inclosing in ligatures, the nerves leading to them, while they have, notwithstanding, still continued to retain their <HI>irritability</HI> for a long time afterwards.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="311" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 311.</HEAD>
<P>In what degree the blood, with which the muscles are very abundantly supplied, contributes to their action, is not yet clearly and satisfactorily ascertained.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="028310_0230_0FD883D4EE8A71A8"/>It appears, however, from an experiment of Steno, that a paralysis of the lower extremities may be generally produced, by passing a ligature round the aorta in its descent behind the abdo∣minal cavity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="312" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 312.</HEAD>
<P>Besides these common inherent energies of the muscles, which have hitherto been the subjects of our consideration, they possess also certain specific and adventitious peculiarities, arising from varieties in their figures, situations, &amp;c. by these peculia∣rities they are adapted, and rendered completely adequate, to the nice performance of their several functions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="313" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 313.</HEAD>
<P>From the contemplation of this circumstance, muscles are usually divided into hollow and solid: the former of these, as we have already seen, not being in immediate subjection to the command of the will, are particularly destined to the perfor∣mance of the <HI>vital</HI> and <HI>natural functions,</HI> and cannot, therefore, be further treated of in this place, where we are considering what are called <HI>voluntary</HI> muscles, which are more especially sub∣servient to that order denominated the <HI>animal functions.</HI></P>

<HEAD>§ 314.</HEAD>
<P>Between these last-mentioned muscles them∣selves, there occur again very striking diversities. For to say nothing of the varieties in their relative magnitudes, they differ extremely from each other in the disposition of their <HI>lacerti</HI> and <HI>fasciculi,</HI> in the direction of their fibres, but more especially in the habit and proportional relation of their fleshy and tendinous parts, and, finally in their courses, their insertions, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="315" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 315.</HEAD>
<P>Nevertheless, in by far the greater part of the <HI>fusiform</HI> or tapering muscles, their figures are more or less oblong, so that their fleshy bellies terminate at each end in tendinous cords. These cords, which are inert and perfectly destitute of irritability, being attached to, and inserted in, bones, serve the necessary purpose of moving them after the manner of levers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="316" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 316.</HEAD>
<P>As there are, however, a few muscles in the body entirely destitute of tendons, such as the <HI>latissimus colli;</HI> so there are, in like manner, a few not attached to bones, namely, the muscle last mentioned, the <HI>cremaster muscle,</HI> as it is generally called, the <HI>azygos uvulae,</HI> and most of those which move the ball of the eye.</P>

<P>By the co-operation and combined aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all those energies, (as well the common, § 305, as the proper, § 312), with which the muscles are furnished these instruments of motion are fitted and completely qualified for the performance of their several actions, which may, in like manner, be also divided into <HI>common</HI> and <HI>proper.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="318" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 318.</HEAD>
<P>During their common action, which arises immediately from irritability, and occurs in all muscles, their fleshy portions become shorter, more rigid, and, for the most part, unevenly and somewhat angular. It also appears from the celebrated experiment of Glisson, that they suffer at the same time a slight diminution in point of magnitude.</P>
<P>We are indeed prevented from joining Jo. and Dan. Bernouille, and other mathematical physicians, in an attempt to reduce the measure of this diminution to common calculation, <HI>first,</HI> by the immense difference in this respect, which is observable between the hollow and solid muscles, and <HI>secondly,</HI> by the diversity which also occurs, on the same point, between these latter muscles themselves;—not to mention various other diffi∣culties, which obstruct the road to success.</P>

<PB N="219" REF="028310_0233_0FD883D996EACA70"/>
<HEAD>§ 319.</HEAD>
<P>The proper or specific actions of the muscles, (§ 317.), correspond precisely to their specific energies; from whence it naturally and sponta∣neously follows, that these actions are marked with such an infinitude of varieties, as to render it literally impossible to reduce them to any general laws, or to arrange them under any well-defined <HI>orders</HI> and <HI>genera.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the general principle, commonly taught and adopted on this subject, viz. that every muscle while in action, draws the more moveable part to which it is attached, towards that which is more permanent, it ought to be considered, (as has been very justly observed by the sagacious Winslow) in a relative point of view, and is indeed subject to a variety of limitations. Thus, for example, the two parts to which a muscle is attached, may be rendered, each more moveable than the other, in alternate vicissitudes, accordingly as the one or the other is fixed and rendered stationary, by the joint action of other co-operating muscles.</P>
<P>As to the action of the flexor muscles, it ought to be estimated on contrary principles, and a dif∣ferent opinion formed respecting it. Although these muscles, for the most part, predominate so much over their antagonists, the <HI>extensors,</HI> that
<PB N="220" REF="028310_0234_0FD883DAE83E0080"/>
when the body is in a state of perfect quietude and rest, the arms, fingers, &amp;c. are under a gentle degree of flexion, yet these parts do not appear to be drawn into this state and position by any actual force, but rather in consequence of a voluntary relaxation of their extensor muscles, by means of which, those muscles, subservient to the flexion of the parts, are left at liberty to act without oppo∣sition or resistance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="320" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 320.</HEAD>
<P>To all the foregoing considerations, it appears proper to add, in the last place, that each muscle possesses a peculiar and specific mechanism, by means of which it is adapted, in the most complete manner, to the performance of the various motions of its immediate destination.</P>
<P>Besides the peculiar advantages which the muscles severally derive from their determinate figures, their actions are also promoted by a variety of other concomitant aids, such, for instance, as the annular ligaments by which they are surrounded; the fat, in which a great number of them are imbedded; the lymphatic dew with which they all abound; and, what ought to have been men∣tioned in the very first instance, the conformation of the skeleton itself, especially as far as the same relates to the structure of the apophyses, and the
<PB N="221" REF="028310_0235_0FD883DCF1930270"/>
articulation of the joints: under the same head of auxiliaries to the muscles, may be also arranged certain entire bones, as the <HI>paetellae,</HI> and ossa sesimoidea, of similar structures and uses, which nature appears to have very wisely adapted and destined to facilitate the motions of particular muscles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="321" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>321.</HEAD>
<P>By these diversified and numerous aids, has nature made compensation for, or at least very considerably diminished, that inevitable loss of power, which necessarily arises from the confor∣mation and statute of the whole body. The acuteness of the angles formed by the insertions of a great many muscles, and the vicinity of these insertions to the centres of motion, may be brought forward as incontrovertible testimonies in favour of such a loss of power, which would not have been sustained, had the tendinous cords been in∣serted at greater distances from the centres of motion, or in such directions, as to have formed more obtuse angles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="322" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 322.</HEAD>
<P>To our bodies, thus furnished with about four hundred and fifty muscles, together with a few occasional supernumeraries, (arising from sexual and individual varieties), two advantages of the utmost magnitude and importance are very obvi∣ously
<PB N="222" REF="028310_0236_0FD883DDE9AF7E58"/>
derived. First, in consequence of this beau∣tiful and complicated system of organs, not only our individual members, but also our whole bo∣dies, are rendered capable of the most astonishing agility, in point of motion; and <HI>secondly,</HI> from the same source, we derive such remarkable de∣grees of strength, as qualify us to bear, without injury, the most arduous species of labour and fatigue. These two momentous advantages de∣pend, indeed, in part, on a perfect state of the muscles, to which, no less than to a perfect state of the bones, we arrive by degrees, as youth advances towards maturity; but they are also, in part acquired by a frequency of use and exercise. The powerful influence which those two latter circumstances possess and exert over the muscles, in strengthening them and rendering them capable of the utmost agility of motion, is strikingly de∣monstrated by numerous examples of rope-walkers, of dancers, of runners, of wrestlers, of boxers, and of those robust barbarians, who constituted the glory and boast of former ages.</P>

<P>THOSE two species of nervous action, (the history of which we have now completed) that have for their ultimate ends <HI>sensation</HI> and <HI>motion,</HI> are so reduced and debilitated by the diversified exercises of the day, that repose by night becomes absolutely necessary, for the purpose of refreshing their declining vigour and energy, which <HI>sleep</HI> alone, the image, or <HI>sem∣blance</HI> of gelid death, is able completely to restore.</P>

<P>Sleep is a function perfectly periodical, which suspends, as it were, for a time, all intercourse and communication between the mind and body. The various phenomena of this function, some of which shall be immediately enumerated, appear to declare, with no small force of evidence, in favour of the existence of a nervous fluid.</P>

<P>Besides a variety of other circumstances, we may here enumerate as precursors and harbingers
<PB N="224" REF="028310_0238_0FD883DF67824200"/>
of sleep, a sluggishness and gradually increasing dullness of the external senses, together with a relaxation of most of the voluntary muscles, especially such as are of considerable length. To these may be added a congestion of the venous blood in, and near, the heart, and an effort to remove the uneasiness thence arising, by the aid of yawning. Finally, the only additional pre∣cursor to be mentioned at present, which appears to constitute the very <HI>isthmus,</HI> as it were, between the waking and sleeping states, and the immediate transition of the former into the latter, is a pecu∣liar species of transient delirium.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="326" TYPE="part">

<P>The following are what constitute the principal phenomena of sleep, when that state has actually occurred: the <HI>animal</HI> functions are wholly sus∣pended from action, while almost all the <HI>others</HI> are at the same time performed in a more sluggish and torpid manner; thus, in subjects buried in sleep, all other circumstances being alike, the pulse is slower, and the heat of the body somewhat diminished; perspiration is also less plentiful; digestion less powerful; and (if the occasional discharge of the semen masculinum be excepted) all the excretions are suppressed, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The <HI>remote causes</HI> which induce sleep are very plain and obvious. For to say nothing of narcotic substances themselves, we may consider as very energetic causes in the production of this state, all <HI>waste</HI> of the <HI>animal powers</HI> by means of preceding <HI>fatigue,</HI> by <HI>watching,</HI> &amp;c. To these we may sub∣join the influence of custom, together with dark∣ness, silence, rest, &amp;c. which appear indeed to derive their somniferous powers from the same source; we may also further add, gentle, uniform, and constant impressions acting on any of the senses, such, for instance, as the soft murmurings of the rill, or the appearance of a harvest field, agitated and thrown into wavy undulations, by the mild fannings of the western breeze, &amp;c. Under the same head of remote causes we may also con∣sider, full meals, and intense cold acting on the body, together with a variety of other circum∣stances, tending to derive the blood from the encephalon, as pediluvia, clysters, and profuse hemorrhages, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="328" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 327.</HEAD>
<P>Those remote causes which we have mentioned in the latter part of the preceding paragraph, are, of themselves, sufficient to conduct us to the <HI>proxi∣mate cause,</HI> which appears, from the best evidence
<PB N="226" REF="028310_0240_0FD8834CA66193A8"/>
that can be collected on the subject, to consist in a diminution of the column of blood that goes to supply the encephalon.</P>
<P>That this is indeed the proximate cause of sleep, is powerfully illustrated and confirmed, by a very singular and striking phenomenon, which I had once an opportunity of observing in a living human subject, whose case has been already men∣tioned on another occasion. As often, and as long, as this person indulged himself in sleep, his brain subsided and continued in a state of consi∣derable collapse, but during his waking hours throughout the day, this organ became again turgid and distended in consequence of a more copious afflux of blood.</P>
<P>As an additional argument in support of the same <HI>cause,</HI> we may observe, that <HI>morbid watch∣fulness,</HI> on the other hand, usually arises from congestions of blood in the region of the brain.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="329" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 329.</HEAD>
<P>The quantity of sleep necessary, depends in a great measure on varieties in age, habit of body, temperament, &amp;c. The general result, however, of all the existing evidences on this subject, appears to be, that a longer indulgence in sleep is either a concomitant of imbecility (as is the case
<PB N="227" REF="028310_0241_0FD883E267AF0AD8"/>
in tender infants. and subjects far advanced in years), or a very exuberant source of fatuity and dullness.</P>

<P>We rise from sleep with renovated powers, and our return into the living, and completely waking state, is accompanied with symptoms and pheno∣mena very similar to those which attended our transition from this state into that of sleep: we are attacked, for instance, by a yawning, accom∣panied for the most part with more or less of a stretching, we are also affected by a certain dull∣ness and torpidity of the senses, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The causes which rouse into wakefulness, ap∣pear to correspond exactly with those productive of sleep.</P>
<P>The proximate cause will be the return of a more copious column of blood into the ence∣phalon.</P>
<P>The remote causes, besides the power of custom, which is confessedly very great, consist of an immense variety of stimuli, that may be divided into <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal.</HI> The external are calculated to excite the slumbering senses, while

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="332" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 332.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Dreams</HI> are light sportings of the imagination, in which it recalls the images of things formerly perceived, and appears to exercise and busy itself in arranging and combining them into the most fantastical representations.</P>
<P>I have never been able to discover the slightest vestige of this faculty in new-born infants pre∣viously to the third month after birth.</P>
<P>There are also various examples of adults who explicitly declare, that they have no knowledge of dreams, having never been troubled by them.</P>
<P>Those visions of the night are, for the most part, indeed, confused and irre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ular; but they are, notwithstanding, sometimes marked with astonishing vestiges of reason.</P>

ideas; the stimulus of an excessive plethora calls up images of a frightful and terrifying nature, &amp;c. We have even received a well confirmed account of a man, to whom, while asleep, his friends could sug∣gest whatever visions they pleased, by communi∣cating to him the subject and matter of the dream in a soft and gentle tone of voice. This appears however, to belong rather to a preternatural state, consisting of somnolency and wakefulness, of which that truly m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbid affection of the <HI>somnam∣bulantes.</HI> or those who walk in their sleep, constitutes also another variety.</P>
<P>It is necessary previously to the final conclusion of this subject to observe, that Locke and others have thought proper to consider all dreams as belonging to this mixed or compound state.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVI. OF FOOD, AND THE APPETITE FOR IT.</HEAD>

<HEAD>§ 332.</HEAD>
<P>AS the waste of the animal powers is again restored by sleep, so in like manner the in∣cestant loss of the natural powers, and even of the very elementary parts of the body, is repaired by fresh and repeated supplies of food.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="333" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 333.</HEAD>
<P>To the acquisition and use of this food we are forcibly led by the frequent and irresistable calls of <HI>nature.</HI> These calls, though widely different from each other in their natures, tend notwith∣standing to the final accomplishment of the same end: they consist, on one hand, of the insupport∣able
<PB N="2" REF="028310_0346_0FDAB4E11219E170"/>
torments of <HI>hunger</HI> and <HI>thirst;</HI> and on the other, of the very pleasing, but no less powerful, allurements of <HI>appetite.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="334" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 334.</HEAD>
<P>The stimulus of <HI>hunger,</HI> some physiologists have sought for in the mutual friction between the rugae of the stomach when empty; others in that which appears, indeed, to be of primary importance in giving birth to this potent sensation, namely, not only in a more copious secretion and afflux of the humours discharged into the first passages, more especially of the saliva, the pancreatic juice, and the bile, but also in a certain degree of morbid acrimony, with which these same humours are apt to be contaminated, unless such a state be guarded against by regular supplies of nourishment.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="335" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 335.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Thirst</HI> is a distressing sensation, arising princi∣pally from a very troublesome dryness of the fau∣ces and esophagus; and also from a peculiar im∣pression produced by taking in acrid, but more especially saline, substances.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="336" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 336.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the absolute <HI>necessity</HI> of satisfy∣ing and removing these stimuli, no fixed and posi∣tive rule can with propriety be laid down, as such
<PB N="3" REF="028310_0347_0FDAB66065B778C8"/>
necessity is doubtless rendered more or less urgent by varieties in age, habit of body, and more espe∣cially by the power of custom. From a general consideration of this subject, however, the result appears to be, that an adult and healthy person, who is under no undue impressions or influence, (in whom, for instance, those assuasive calls of na∣ture are neither silenced by the louder ravings of enthusiastic fanaticism, nor by other preternatural causes) cannot refrain from the use of food, for even one whole day, without a very great prostra∣tion of strength; and can seldom fast for more than eight days without incurring the utmost hazard of life.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="337" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 337.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to <HI>drink,</HI> although a desire for this appears to urge with the greater vehemence and intensity of the two, it is, notwithstanding, much less necessary to life and health than the ar∣ticle of <HI>food.</HI> This we infer, with apparently strict propriety and truth, not only from numerous species of warm-blooded animals, as mice, quails, &amp;c. that are never impelled by necessity to the use of drink, but also from actual examples of certain individuals of the human race, who have conti∣nued, through a long series of time, in the enjoy∣ment of life, health, and spirits, without recourse to the use of drinks of any kind.</P>

<HEAD>§ 338.</HEAD>
<P>As to <HI>food,</HI> controversies have existed respecting the kind most proper to satisfy the internal calls of our nature: whether, for example, the struc∣ture and constitution of the human body corres∣pond most perfectly with food taken from the ani∣mal, or with that derived from the vegetable, kingdom; and which of these two kinds of sub∣stances nature, therefore, designed to constitute the aliment of man?</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="339" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 339.</HEAD>
<P>That man is by nature an herbivorous animal, Rousseau attempted, with a great degree of acute∣ness, to prove, not only by arguments taken from the figure of his teeth, and the length of his in∣testines, but by the further consideration, that wo∣man is naturally uniparous, and furnished with two mammae, &amp;c.; to all which might be added, actual examples of rumination having been per∣formed by human subjects, a process well known to belong exclusively to herbivorous animals.</P>
<P>Those, on the contrary, who, with Helvetius, consider man as a carnivorous animal, attempt to support their opinion by the shortness of his <HI>intes∣tinum caecum,</HI> and other arguments of a similar nature.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="340" TYPE="part">
<PB N="5" REF="028310_0349_0FDAB66A5B494A60"/>
<HEAD>§ 340.</HEAD>
<P>But from more accurate observation, and a more minute investigation of the subject, it ap∣pears, that nature did not intend to restrict man to the exclusive use of either the one or the other of those kinds of <HI>aliment,</HI> but more indulgently destined him to a free participation of both. That this is indeed the kind destination of man with re∣spect to the nature of his food, we very naturally infer from his teeth, especially the <HI>molares,</HI> and the conformation of his intestines, briefly mentioned above, possessing a middle state between the same parts, as they exist in carnivorous and in herbivo∣rous animals. This prerogative of man is, how∣ever, still more forcibly demonstrated, by the na∣ture of the articulation which connects the con∣dyles of the lower jaw to the <HI>ossa temporum</HI> in hu∣man subjects.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="341" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 341.</HEAD>
<P>If the observations be true (and they surely cannot be doubted) which we stated on a former occasion, respecting the high privilege of man, in being by far better calculated than other animals for traversing an extensive range of climate on the globe we inhabit, it from thence spontane∣ously follows, that he would have been indeed very illy accommodated, in being solely restricted either to the one or the other of the above kinds
<PB N="6" REF="028310_0350_0FDAB66C62B75C10"/>
of food: for as some regions of the globe afford <HI>animal,</HI> and others <HI>vegetable</HI> food alone, the ob∣vious and unhappy result of such an exclusive re∣striction would have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, that man, though cal∣culated and destined to reside in all latitudes of the earth, must, notwithstanding, in some of them, be denied the use of such aliments as nature had rendered essentially necessary to the continuatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his existence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="342" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 342.</HEAD>
<P>Of all animals, with which we are in any mea∣sure acquainted, man may, with the strictest pro∣priety and truth, be said to be <HI>omniverous.</HI> As on the one hand he is calculated to banquet in luxury, amidst the most profuse variety of delica∣cies that art can prepare from the immense re∣sources of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, so, on the contrary, he is able to retain his health and vigour when subsisting on the most simple and frugal fare.</P>
<P>Thus, to produce only a very few examples, a great many men even at the present day subsist solely on a vegetable diet, such as potatoes, ches∣nuts, dates, &amp;c. which constituted also the food of the first progenitors of the human race: for it ap∣pears highly probable, that those simple and hardy sons of nature, supported life first by the fruits and
<PB N="7" REF="028310_0351_0FDAB670E8573D70"/>
roots of plants, and afterwards, by the more sub∣stantial and durable fare of grains and pulse.</P>
<P>Some of the Moorish tribes in Africa live almost entirely on the gum senegal.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Kamschatka and of a great many other maritime situations subsist on fish.</P>
<P>In Europe itself, the <HI>Morlachi</HI> are supported al∣most entirely on a diet of flesh.</P>
<P>Some nations of Barbarians subsist even on raw flesh, a circumstance which is undoubtedly true, with respect to the Samoids, the Esquimaux, and certain tribes of people inhabiting South America.</P>
<P>Neither are the liquids made use of as drinks, in certain nations, less singular and striking.</P>
<P>Thus the inhabitants of several islands, which lie between the tropics, more especially those situ∣ated in the Pacific Ocean, are entirely destitute of sweet and pleasant water, and therefore, as a sub∣stitute for this fluid, use the delicious juice of the <HI>lactescent cocoa.</HI></P>
<P>Others again drink the waters of the briny ocean;—from all which facts and circumstances,
<PB N="8" REF="028310_0352_0FDAB6726326EE90"/>
taken collectively, together with an infinitude of others that might be adduced, we need not hesitate a moment to pronounce, that man is literally an <HI>omnivorous animal.</HI></P>

<P>FOR the purpose of masticating the more solid species of food, both our under, and upper jaws, are armed with <HI>three</HI> different kinds of teeth.</P>
<P>These are <HI>first,</HI> the <HI>incisores,</HI> which, in most men, are chisel-formed, and well calculated to bite off morsels of food.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> the <HI>canini,</HI> strong, conical and com∣pletely adapted for breaking substances of greater firmness.</P>
<P>And <HI>lastly,</HI> the <HI>molares,</HI> of different sizes, exqui∣sitely fitted for the process of grinding.</P>
</DIV3>

<PB N="9" REF="028310_0353_0FDAB6769BA42048"/>
<HEAD>§ 344.</HEAD>
<P>The mandible or lower jaw is connected to the other parts of the head, by means of a very singu∣lar variety of articulation, which appears to be of a middle nature between <HI>arthroida</HI> and <HI>ganglimus.</HI> Being furnished with a pair of double concave car∣tilages, it thus unites, to a sufficient degree of strength and firmness, a capacity of being easily and very considerably moved in all directions.</P>
<P>The under jaw is drawn back, in opening the mouth, chiefly by means of the <HI>musculus biventer,</HI> but in part also by the geniohyoidei and the my∣lohyoidei.</P>
<P>It is brought back again, when we attempt to cut any thing through with the dentes incisores, and pressed with astonishing force against the opposite jaw, during our efforts to crush any hard substances, by the masseter and temporal muscles.</P>
<P>It is moved laterally in chewing, by the action of the internal and external pterygoid muscles; the latter of which have also the power of moving it in a forward direction.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="345" TYPE="part">
<PB N="10" REF="028310_0354_0FDAB677BB7E4D08"/>
<HEAD>§ 345.</HEAD>
<P>Substances taken into the mouth for the pur∣pose of being chewed, are retained, placed in a proper situation, and thus effectually subjected to the action of the teeth, by means of the <HI>musculus buccinator,</HI> and the tongue, an organ of extreme flexibility, and very capable of changing its form (§ 233).</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="346" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 346.</HEAD>
<P>During the act of manducation we emulge, as it were, a certain quantity of <HI>saliva,</HI> which is an aqueous liquid, of a nature somewhat saponace∣ous; it contains a small quantity of earthy matter, (which gives origin to tartarous incrustations of the teeth, and to small sublingual calculi); this fluid, from being in perpetual contact with the tongue, makes no sensible impressions of taste on that organ, although it contains a small quantity of microcosmic salt; it possesses antiseptic and re∣solvent properties, and has also a power of spee∣dily exciting the process of fermentation in vege∣table substances especially in those of the farina∣ceous kind.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="347" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 347.</HEAD>
<P>The sources from whence this fluid is derived are, small conglomerate glands, of three several
<PB N="11" REF="028310_0355_0FDAB680A2EFC578"/>
orders, the lateral and internal, of which are situ∣ated beneath the lower jaw.</P>
<P>The most considerable of these glands, called <HI>parotids,</HI> (remarkable, on account of being ex∣tremely subject to metastases), excrete their saliva through the Stenonian duct, just behind the middle molar tooth of the upper jaw.</P>
<P>The saliva furnished by the <HI>submaxillary</HI> glands, is discharged through the duct of Wharton.</P>
<P>That derived from the <HI>sublingual</HI> glands, which are the least of all, flows through the numerous ducts of Rivinus.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="348" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 348.</HEAD>
<P>The excretion of saliva, (of which, in confor∣mity to the opinion of Nuck, about a pint is com∣monly supposed to be secreted in the space of twelve hours), is considerably encreased both by the application of any stimulating substance, and also by mechanical pressure, the latter of which appears to act merely by emulging the containing parts.</P>
<P>Thus, whatever hard substances we chew, be∣come perfectly moistened and macerated, as it were, by a copious afflux of saliva produced in
<PB N="12" REF="028310_0356_0FDAB68416DDED78"/>
consequence of the pressure, to which the <HI>parotids</HI> are particularly exposed from, being situated so near to the articulation of the lower jaw.</P>
<P>With regard to the operation of stimuli on the secretion of this fluid, it is necessary farther to ob∣serve, that when acrid substances are taken into the mouth, a plentiful afflux of saliva is immedi∣ately produced, which has the effect of diluting and thus effectually counteracting the irritating acrimony: an increase of the same fluid is also oc∣casionally produced by the stimulus of the imagi∣nation; to this cause must we refer that afflux of saliva, which so frequently accompanies a strong appetite for food.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="349" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 349.</HEAD>
<P>With the saliva are blended a fine aqueous, dew-like fluid, which transudes from the soft parts of the mouth, and also a mucus, secreted by small glands, situated in the lips and cheeks: it is a portion of this mucus by which the tongue is lu∣bricated.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="350" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 350.</HEAD>
<P>The morsel during mastication, being thorough∣ly moistened by this mixture of saliva and other animal juices, is thus, not only converted by de∣grees into a soft pulpy bolus, more fit for the pur∣pose
<PB N="13" REF="028310_0357_0FDAB68525DEC360"/>
of deglutition, but is likewise prepared, at the same time, for further digestion and final assi∣milation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="351" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 351.</HEAD>
<P>The actual business of deglutition, although it appears to be of a very compound nature, and is indeed performed by the co-operation of a great many different parts, may be considered as com∣mencing and proceeding in the following order; viz. the tongue being first retracted towards its basis, and becoming therefore somewhat turgid and stiff, receives on its excavated <HI>dursum</HI> or back, the lubricated and moistened bolus, which is from thence forced onwards into the fauces, where it is received by the expanded <HI>infundibulum</HI> of the <HI>pharynx,</HI> which appears, at the same time, to ad∣vance somewhat upwards; on the reception of the food the infundibulum makes a singular and vio∣lent exertion, which may be supposed to proceed from a species of <HI>vita propria;</HI> from this funnel-like entrance, the bolus is again protruded on∣ward, by a threefold contraction of the pharynx, into the <HI>oesophagus.</HI> All the above motions suc∣ceed each other with the utmost degree of rapidi∣ty, and are of extremely short continuance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="352" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 352.</HEAD>
<P>For the purposes of expanding this passage, and rendering it at the same time steady and secure,
<PB N="14" REF="028310_0358_0FDAB68A073133A8"/>
nature has made the most ample provision by a variety of auxiliary parts.</P>
<P>The motion of the tongue, in this momentous business, is regulated and directed by the os hyo∣ideum.</P>
<P>To prevent any of the substances swallowed, from passing, by mistake, either into the internal nares, or into the eustachean tubes, the soft palate is very wisely provided. This fleshy curtain, de∣pending equally from the arched roof to which it is attached, is capable of being rendered tense by the action of a peculiar set of muscles, and thus the above passages may be completely closed.</P>
<P>The <HI>glottis</HI> is securely guarded by the tongue itself, because at the very instant in which we at∣tempt to swallow, the larynx, being drawn up∣ward and forward, is in a certain degree concealed beneath the retracted basis of the tongue, and is so compressed by it, that the glottis, not only by this constriction, but also by the additional security of the epiglottis, is thus very effectually guarded against the intrusive entrance of any heterogene∣ous substances.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="353" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 353.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, the business of deglutition is greatly fa∣cilitated by means of a quantity of mucus, with
<PB N="15" REF="028310_0359_0FDAB68DB303A1A0"/>
which the whole of the passage above described is lubricated; and which, besides the lingual glands already mentioned (§ 235), is chiefly fur∣nished by the numerous sinuses of the tonsils, and by that infinitude of mucaginous <HI>cryptae,</HI> so pro∣fusely bestowed on the larynx itself.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="354" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 354.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the <HI>oesophagus</HI> itself, through which all substances swallowed must necessarily pass, previously to their entrance into the stomach, it is a fleshy canal, rather narrow in its diameter, and exceedingly firm and strong, but at the same time pliable, dilatable, and possessed of a high degree of sensibility: it is composed of tunics or coats, which, if we except the difference in their thick∣ness, bear no small resemblance to the coats of the other portions of the alimentary canal.</P>
<P>Thus, the external covering is muscular, made up of fibres running both longitudinally and in transverse or circular directions.</P>
<P>The middle coat is nervous, ending on each side in a very lax cellular membrane, by means of which it is connected, as well to the preceding, as to the subsequent tunic.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="028310_0360_0FDAB68EE8957338"/>Lastly, the internal coat is lined by mucus of an exquisite degree of lubricity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="355" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 355.</HEAD>
<P>The following appears to be the mode in which this canal performs its office; as soon as it has re∣ceived either a draught or bolus completely within its <HI>parietes,</HI> the parts immediately above presently contract themselves, thus forcing downwards the substance to be swallowed; which, if it be a bo∣lus, can be protruded onward only by one uni∣form series of exertions in the surrounding tube, till it has passed through the diaphragm, and been finally received into the cavity of the stomach itself.</P>

<P>THE chamber, or immediate seat of di∣gestion, is the <HI>stomach,</HI> a viscus more uniformly possessed than any other, by almost every indivi∣dual throughout the immense range of <HI>animated nature:</HI> if, therefore, we estimate the dignity of the several viscera from this circumstance alone, the stomach is, doubtless, to be considered as an
<PB N="17" REF="028310_0361_0FDAB694E86892F0"/>
organ surpassing all the others in utility and im∣portance to the animal economy.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="357" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 357.</HEAD>
<P>The human stomach resembles a leathern pouch, of very considerable dimensions, sufficient, for the most part, in an adult, to contain three pints, or more, of water, and furnished with two separate orifices or mouths:</P>
<P>These are, <HI>first,</HI> a superior orifice, called <HI>car∣dia,</HI> which is formed in the place where the oeso∣phagus, by a plaited and somewhat oblique aper∣ture, opens into the stomach itself, and points to∣wards the bottom of this viscus, or that extremity which regards the left side of the body.</P>
<P>Secondly, an <HI>inferior</HI> one, which constitutes the termination of the right, and less capacious end of the stomach: this orifice is called <HI>pylorus,</HI> and de∣scends a short distance into the cavity of the ad∣joining duodenum.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="358" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 358.</HEAD>
<P>The situation of the stomach, when empty, is different from that of the same organ, when full: thus, in the <HI>former</HI> state, it hangs loose and flaccid in the abdominal cavity, in such a manner that its greater curvature looks in a backward direction;
<PB N="18" REF="028310_0362_0FDAB699C0BC3B80"/>
and its pylorus, being turned somewhat upwards, forms a plaited or twisted angle with the duode∣num, to which it is connected.</P>
<P>But in the <HI>latter</HI> state, when distended with food, its greater curvature is again turned, and looks in an anterior direction, so that the pylorus enters now, by a more direct route, into the duodenum; whereas the cardia, on the contrary, is so folded and bent as to be completely closed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="359" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 359.</HEAD>
<P>The stomach is composed of four principal coats, distinguished and separated by three others, of an entirely cellular nature, which lie between them.</P>
<P>The most <HI>external</HI> of these coverings is common to the stomach, with all the rest (save a small por∣tion) of the alimentary canal, and is continued over the <HI>omenta,</HI> which shall be spoken of here∣after.</P>
<P>Next to this, lies that <HI>cellulo-muscular</HI> coat, so very striking in its nature and properties, on which depend both the exquisite <HI>irritability</HI> of the sto∣mach (§ 306.), and also its peristaltic motion; the latter of which shall be a subject of consideration in another place. This coat is composed of dif∣ferent
<PB N="19" REF="028310_0363_0FDAB69AE1ECA1A0"/>
strata of muscular fibres, which are usually divided into three orders, one longitudinal, and two circular; the circular fibres are again divided into those that are <HI>directly,</HI> and those that are <HI>ob∣liquely,</HI> circular. It must, however, be observed, that so extremely variable and irregular are the fi∣bres of this coat, with regard to their direction and distribution, as scarcely to admit of reduction to, and arrangement under, any determinate and general rules.</P>
<P>The third principal coat is called the <HI>nervous,</HI> an appellation extremely improper, as it is compo∣sed wholly of condensed cellular membrane, be∣coming gradually more soft and lax on each side; by which means it is connected externally to the muscular, and internally to what we shall presently call the <HI>villous,</HI> coat. It is, notwithstanding, so firm and robust, that it may be aptly enough call∣ed the <HI>basis</HI> of the whole stomach.</P>
<P>Lastly, the <HI>internal</HI> coat, which has been very improperly called <HI>villous,</HI> is exceedingly tender, somewhat spongy, porous, and folded into a very great number of rugae or wrinkles, so that its area is much more extensive than that of any of the other coats which we have just described: it every where exhibits cells of the utmost minuteness, some∣what
<PB N="20" REF="028310_0364_0FDAB6A1445ADE40"/>
similar in appearance to those larger ones, with which the <HI>reticulum</HI> of ruminating animals is very beautifully and elegantly characterized.</P>
<P>The internal surface of this coat is lined with mucus, apparently secreted by small mucaginous cryptae, some of which may be, indeed, readily enough distinguished near to the <HI>pylorus,</HI> or lower orifice of this organ.</P>

<P>The stomach is furnished with an astonishing apparatus of nerves, whence its sensibility is so ex∣quisite, that it is capable of being very readily af∣fected by stimuli of almost every kind, whether they be <HI>external,</HI> as cold &amp;c. or <HI>internal</HI> as food, and even by the inquiline humours themselves. From the same source arises also that extensive, and truly admirable consent, which exists between this important viscus and most of the other func∣tions of the body; to which head belongs, in a particular manner, the striking effects, produced on the stomach, by all mental commotious, and also, on the other hand, the very powerful influ∣ence of an entirely sound and healthy state of this organ, on the cheerfulness and serenity of the <HI>mind.</HI></P>

<P>The number and functions of the <HI>blood vessels,</HI> belonging to the stomach, are no less considerable and striking, than those of the <HI>nerves.</HI> The small arteries, (of which an infinitude of different or∣ders, are minutely interspersed throughout the cel∣lular coats of this organ), appear to constitute the immediate sources of the <HI>gastric juice,</HI> a liquor which flows in perpetual streamlets from the inter∣nal surface of the stomach.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="362" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 362.</HEAD>
<P>This juice bears, on the whole, no small resem∣blance to saliva, except that, agreeably to the ex∣periments of the illustrious Spalanzani, its <HI>powers</HI> are counter to <HI>those</HI> which promote fermentation. As to the rest of its properties, it is saponaceous, equally antiseptic with the saliva, and is indeed, a very powerful menstruum, sufficient gradually to dissolve milk after it has been gently coagulated in the stomach.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="363" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 363.</HEAD>
<P>The gastric juice appears to be the most power∣ful and active agent in the great business of diges∣tion. If the <HI>food</HI> be carefully masticated, and suf∣ficiently blended with the menstruum furnished by the salivary glands, this fluid of the stomach com∣pletely
<PB N="22" REF="028310_0366_0FDAB6A4695200C0"/>
dissolves, and finally converts it, into a soft pultaceous chyme.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="364" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 364.</HEAD>
<P>This momentous function is also further aided and promoted, by a variety of accessory and assis∣tant powers: of these the most considerable is the <HI>peristaltic motion,</HI> by means of which the food, now reduced to a pulpy consistence, is thoroughly agitated, and kept perpetually in a state of wavy commotion. Although the force of the peristaltic motion fall far short of the chimerical calculations, formerly made on this subject, by mathematical physicians, and although it be not itself the sole cause of digestion, it is, notwithstanding, of the utmost efficacy and influence in this important process.</P>

<HEAD>§ 365.</HEAD>
<P>Among the auxiliary powers, of this kind, may be also reckoned another species of motion, which the pressure of the surrounding parietes of the ab∣domen, communicates to the stomach: to these we may still farther subjoin, the extreme warmth of the situation in which this viscus is placed; so very powerful was this <HI>fotus</HI> or bath, formerly esteem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, in cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quence of the abundant quan∣tity of blood contained in the neighbouring vessels

<P>To determine, with precision, the period of time requisite for the <HI>conversion</HI> of our aliment into chyme by the joint co-operation of the foregoing powers (§ 361.), will appear almost impossible to any one, who may consider the great variety of circumstances, on which such conversion must de∣pend: these circumstances are, the quality and quantity of the food taken in, the different degrees of force in the digestive powers, the greater or less attention and care bestowed on the prepara∣tion of the food for digestion, by previous masti∣cation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For in a healthy subject, the unimpaired sto∣mach does not discharge such alimentary matters as have been taken in, previously to the conver∣sion of their digestible parts into a perfect pulp. From whence it is evident, that different periods of time are requisite, for the complete digestion of different kinds of food. If, however, it be allow∣able to form any general conclusion on this subject, it would appear, that from the third, to the sixth hour, after the use of aliment, the stomach has, for the most part, discharged through the pylorus,
<PB N="24" REF="028310_0368_0FDAB6AAAE85AB00"/>

<P>Of these two humours, we will speak in sepa∣rate sections.

<P>Although it be indeed a matter of no small diffi∣culty, to procure the pancreatic liquor of a sound animal, in a pure and unadulterated state, yet the obvious and unequivocal result of all the facts, which the most attentive investigation has been able to supply, with regard to its nature, is, that it bears the strongest similitude to the saliva in all its general properties. Were it not for the pur∣pose of showing how mischievous, and even de∣structive, the practice of medicine may become, unless directed by sound principles of physiology, I should not think it necessary nor even proper, at

the present enlightened period, to mention the er∣roneous physiological hypotheses, entertained by Franc. Sylvius, and his humble followers, Regn. de Graef, Flor.

<P>The sources from whence the lymph and saliva are derived, bear no small resemblance to that which constitutes the subject of our present consi∣deration, namely, the <HI>pancreas:</HI> this latter is by far the largest of all the conglomerate glands of the human body, and exhibits, in the whole of its structure, a very striking similitude to the glands, that give birth to the salivary fluid; with these last mentioned bodies it also further agrees, in this particular, that its excretory canals, arising from radicles of the utmost minuteness, run together and unite by degrees, till they constitute finally a common duct, which has received its name from Jo. G. Wirsung, who first discovered and de∣monstrated it in the human subject, in the year 1642.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="028310_0371_0FDAB7C9079B4BD0"/>This duct passes through the coats of the duo∣denum, and by a constant <HI>stillicidium,</HI> weeps into the cavity of that intestine, the fluid it had receiv∣ed from the gland to which it is appended.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="372" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 372.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, the excretion of this fluid appears to be promoted by the very same powers, which were formerly said to be subservient to the excretion of saliva, namely, <HI>pressure</HI> and <HI>stimulus.</HI></P>
<P>By means of the former, it is emulged chiefly when the stomach is distended and rests immedi∣ately on the pancreas.</P>
<P>The substances that contribute most, by their irritations, to excite a discharge of the pancreatic fluid are, first, the chyme itself, as it passes through the pylorus in a crude and unassimilated state; and secondly, the bile, which is discharged through the very same orifice with the liquor of the pan∣creas.</P>
</DIV3>

<P>The use of this fluid is doubtless to dissolve the chyme, more especially that part of it, which has not been sufficiently digested in the stomach: by its abundant afflux, it contributes to assimilate this

<HEAD>SECT. XXX. OF THE BILE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Doctor Maclurg, of Virginia, published in the year 1772, an experimental treatise on the formation, the nature and the uses of the human bile, which has acquired for its learned and ingenious author, no small degree of reputation both at home and abroad. That this elaborate publication possesses an uncommon share of merit, not even the avowed enemies of the Doctor are themselves able to deny. The author has shewn himself to be, at least, a very patient expe∣rimenter, and an extremely attentive observer. He appears to have made himself perfectly master of the opinions of all authors of celebrity and distinction, who had previously writ∣ten on the same subject. With regard to the literary merit of the composition itself, it is doubtless entitled to the highest en∣comiums that even the most partial eulogist can bestow. The order is inimitably lucid, the style is cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, manly and ner∣vous in the highest degree, and as to closeness and propriety of argumentative arrangement, not even the supercilious lo∣gitian himself, can find room to suggest the shadow of an amendment.</P>
<P>All human compositions are, however, like the sources from whence they originate, in some measure faulty and im∣perfect. To this general maxim, humiliating as it may ap∣pear to the pride of the self-adoring philosopher, the treatise of the illustrious Maclurg is by no means an exception. In several of the Doctor's experiments there appears to be a want of sufficient accuracy and definitude, in others a want of object and design. Over these faults, however, consider∣able as they are in the works of an experimentalist, we feel inclined to spread a kind mantle of palliation, when we re∣collect that our author experimented and wrote in the early morn of scientific chemistry. Experimenters had not yet be∣come perfect adopts in their nice and momentous art; they had not yet acquired sufficient circumspection and address to obviate every source of fallacy, and to avail themselves of every circumstance that might pave the way to satisfactory and unequivocal results.</P>
<P>But another cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge of a more weighty and important na∣ture, lies against our learned and ingenious author. He h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s certainly built, on nothing more substantial than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>limsy basis of deceptious analogy, some of the leading principles of his favourite doctrine▪ Thus, for example, he supposes the bile to be a fluid, the direct result of a putrefactive degene∣racy in a portion of the circulating volume of the blood. His most plausible reasons in support of this opinion are, <HI>first,</HI> that the parts, from whence the incipient radicles of the vena portarum immediately originate, contain, and communicate with, matter already in a semiputrescent state. And <HI>second∣ly,</HI> that the bile is most abundant in quantity and most active with regard to its quality, at that season, and under those circumstances, which are most favourable to the commence∣ment and progress of putrefaction in the living system, as well as in all other physical bodies.</P>
<P>Plausible as those arguments may, on first view appear, they are certainly, as already observed, founded on nothing better than fair, but fallacious analogy. The principle which they tend to establish stands in the most direct opposi∣tion to the result of experiment—sacred experiment! the on∣ly unerring guide to conduct the candid enquirer to the ever∣lasting temple of truth. Did our learned author (I would beg leave to ask) ever faithfully experiment on separate por∣tions of the blood, drawn from different parts of the body, in order to determine the comparative proximity of each portion, to the putrefactive s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate? I presume he never did, otherwise his opinion on this subject would have been, doubtless, very diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rent from what we find in his ingenious publication. For it is a truth, nothing the less sacred and respectable on account of its novelty, that if equal quantities of blood be taken from the <HI>vena p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtarum,</HI> and from the lungs or any part of the arterial system, and exposed to the same incumbent circumstances, the <HI>pulmonic</HI> or <HI>arterial,</HI> will assume the putre∣factive process, much sooner than the <HI>hepatic,</HI> blood. The cause of this phenomenon must be sufficiently obvious to any one acquainted with the late discoveries, in the divine science of chemistry. We would attempt its solution in the follow∣ing manner.</P>
<P>Vital air (which is indeed the genuine septic principle, if any such principle exist) is in all cases essential to the progress of putrefaction. This air, or rather its base (termed oxygene by the ingenious chemists of France) is, as we have the strong∣est reasons to believe, from the experiments of Goodwyn, Beddoes, Girtanner, and others, intimately blended with the circulating blood in its passage through the lungs. As the blood proceeds in its mazy route through the different parts of the arterial system, it is gradually robbed of its concommi∣tant oxygene or base of vital air, by the mysterious action of the animal system. The consequence of this spoliation is, that the florid <HI>arterial,</HI> assumes a much darker colour, and suf∣fers finally a complete transmutation into <HI>venous</HI> blood. In this latter state the putrefactive process is less apt to com∣mence, because the blood contains less oxygene in a state of intimate mixture, or perhaps I might with more propriety say, in a state of combination. For in proportion as the base of vital air is more intimately blended with, and therefore more nearly approximated to, the constituent parts of the blood, the more powerfully can it co-operate with other aux∣iliary agents, in inducing <HI>these parts</HI> to assume that intestine motion, which constitutes the putrefactive process. Although our learned author is decidedly of opinion, that putrefaction commences more readily, if vital air be excluded altogether from the putrefying substances, yet it is now well know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that the very reverse of this is true. Exclude vital air from a body, in the composition of which none of this energetic fluid exists, and you thereby embalm that body in a deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> equal, if not superior to the embalmment of the unperishable mummies of the East.</P>
<P>No body, whatever, is capable of taking on the putrefac∣tive process, that does not contain in its composition more or less of those simple substances that belong to the class of <HI>inflammables.</HI> Reasoning therefore a <HI>priori,</HI> or climbing the arduous steeps of science by the more laborious steps of expe∣riment and observation, we are warranted in either case to conclude, that putrefaction consists, in a very considerable degree, in the intimate combination of the base of vital air to certain substances of an inflammable nature. Both the pri∣mary elements of which putrefiable bodies are composed, and also the results of actual putrefaction, co-operate in the esta∣blishment of the same conclusion.</P>
<P>It is certainly a truth, that vital air is as essential to the putrefactive process as it is to the support of combustion, or the continuance of animal life.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we may without the smallest hesitation conclude, that the former opinions of physiologists respecting the supposed putrescent disposition of the hepatic blood, are wholly insupportable by argument or fact, being indeed di∣rectly opposed to the literal result of positive experiment; and therefore, that the pious eulogia so profusely bestowed on the powers of the animal economy, in being able to form an <HI>antiseptic</HI> out of a highly <HI>putrescent</HI> fluid, appear to be as visionary and hypothetical, as <HI>nature's</HI> final intention in the preparation of this fluid was thought to be beneficent, and her process itself beautiful, and interesting.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

sight, from that of all the other viscera of the body: it consists of a parenchyma of a well known colour and very tender texture: this parenchyma is abundantly supplied with nerves, with lympha∣tic vessels (very visible on both surfaces), with bi∣liferous ducts, and finally with blood-vesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, from thence these ducts originate: with respect to these blood-vessels, some of which are remarkably large, we will immediately state a few observations on each of their several orders.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="376" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 376.</HEAD>
<P>The first vessel which here presents itself for our consideration is, the <HI>vena portarum,</HI> which differs very widely from every other portion of the venous system, not only in its singular appear∣ance, but also in the peculiarity of its course and distribution, of which a few words were spoken on a former occasion (§ 87). This large vessel is formed by the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ux of by far the greater number of the venous branches that originate and run from the viscera, situated in the lower part of the abdomen, and is invested and strengthened by
<PB N="34" REF="028310_0378_0FDAB7DA750C5280"/>
a cellular covering, commonly known by the name of <HI>capsula Glissonii.</HI> No sooner does this trunk make its entrance into the liver, than it is divided into several branches, which as they run in vari∣ous directions through its substance, suffer still far∣ther divisions, till they are finally encreased to a countless number of the most subtle ramifications, which pervade, with the utmost minuteness, every portion of this viscus. This whole system of the vena portarum was formerly compared, by Galen, to a tree, the roots of which are dispersed through∣out the whole cavity of the abdomen, while its branches are enclosed in the more contracted vo∣lume of the liver.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="377" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 377.</HEAD>
<P>Another blood-vessel of a different kind, with which the liver is furnished, is the <HI>arteria hepatica.</HI> This vessel originates from the caeliac artery, and although far inferior to the vena portarum, both in its capacity and in the number of its branches, is, notwithstanding, divided into ramifications of astonishing subtility, and is also distributed with a great deal of minuteness throughout every part of the liver.</P>

<P>The extreme terminations of both the forego∣ing kinds of vessels, end in genuine veins, which
<PB N="35" REF="028310_0379_0FDAB7DF9901C778"/>
gradually uniting, form by their general conflux, certain large venous trunks, that lose themselves finally in the inferior <HI>vena cava.</HI></P>

<DIV3 N="379" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 379.</HEAD>
<P>Those extreme terminations, by which these small branches of the vena portarum and arteria hepatica become radicles to the vena cava, form a very subtle vascular texture, exhibiting a singu∣lar and striking appearance, as if the vessels were convoluted, or wound up into globes of incon∣ceivable minuteness. These globular bodies im∣posed so effectually on Malpighi, as to induce that illustrious physiologist to consider them as glandu∣lar, hexagonal, and hollow kernels, destined to constitute the immediate chambers of secretion.</P>

<P>From th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se same globular convolutions of blood-vessels arise, lastly, the <HI>pori biliarii.</HI> These are very tender ducts, which convey the gallish liquid from the blood, and completely eliminate the same from the system of the liver, through the <HI>ductus hepaticus communis,</HI> a canal which they form by their general conflux.</P>

<P>It is common for physiologists to enquire, from what kind of blood the bile is immediately
<PB N="36" REF="028310_0380_0FDAB7E1EEBEDBA0"/>
secreted; whether from arterial, or from that con∣tained in the <HI>vena portarum?</HI></P>
<P>Although the former of these opinions appears, on the first view of the subject, to be rendered most probable from the analogy of other secre∣tions, which are evidently the result of arterial action, yet from a more accurate investigation of the matter we will readily be convinced, that by far the greater part, if not indeed the whole, of the bi∣liary secretion, is derived from the vena portarum: the blood of this vessel being lurid, and highly im∣pregnated with phlogiston, corresponds precisely with the nature of the bile; but how extremely different, on the other hand, are the habit and constitution of the florid and fiery arterial blood, which the caeliac artery transmits from the aorta immediately to the liver!</P>
<P>With respect to arguments drawn from analogy we may observe, that as the vena portarum is sub∣jected to an arterial distribution, so it may, in like manner, possess the power of performing an arte∣rial function: this same opinion, for which we con∣tend, appears also to derive additional support from the analogy which exists between the liver and the lungs: to perform the leading function of these last mentioned viscera, is doubtless the imme∣diate destination of the large pulmonary arteries;
<PB N="37" REF="028310_0381_0FDAB7E3618B4BA8"/>
whereas, on the other hand, the bronchial artery is only subservient to the nourishment of the parts, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which it is distributed:—the discharge of an office, similar to this latter, is also, if we be not greatly deceived, the more immediate destination of the <HI>arteria hepatica.</HI> Notwithstanding what we have here advanced, we are still ready to ac∣knowledge, that the hepatic artery may possibly contribute somewhat towards the secretion of bile; but, that its influence, in this respect, is indeed very inconsiderable, and not yet sufficiently ascer∣tained and demonstrated, are positions to which we subscribe with the utmost confidence.</P>

<P>The gall-bladder retains the bile, when once received, till that liquor either flows out spontane∣ously, in consequence of being favoured by a re∣clined and somewhat supine position of the body, or till it is emulged from the cyst by the pressure of the neighbouring intestines, namely, the <HI>jeju∣num</HI> and <HI>ileum,</HI> or by the occasional passage of hardened faeces through the transverse colon.</P>

<P>Although the constituent parts of this fluid nei∣ther separate from each other spontaneously, nor yet by so simple a mode of treatment as is sufficient to produce that effect on the parts that compose the blood, they may, notwithstanding, be subject∣ed, without much-difficulty, to such an examina∣tion as will make it appear, that they doubtless possess and exhibit a certain analogy to the ele∣mentary parts of the blood, though this analogy should not be pursued to too great an extent.</P>
<P>The bile contains, in the first place, an aqueous menstruum, which has been denominated by some late physiologists, its <HI>salivary</HI> part: this may be aptly enough compared to the aqueous portion, and resembles also, though not in every particu∣lar, the serum of the blood.</P>
<P>From the bile we can also separate and procure a small portion of a white and grumous substance, which may be said to possess a certain, though re∣mote resemblance to the plastic <HI>lymph</HI> of the blood.</P>
<P><PB REF="028310_0386_0FDAB7F3E77E0FC8"/>Finally, the most striking and important princi∣ple which the bile contains is the <HI>matter</HI> of <HI>phlo∣giston,</HI> derived in large quantities from the blood of the vena portarum, which is highly impreg∣nated with this subtle element.</P>

<P>This active inflammable part evidently manifests its existence in dried bile, but more especially in gall stones, by bursting immediately into flame, when placed in contact with a burning substance. To the action and influence of this principle must we attribute those striking and singular qualities, formerly enumerated, such as colour, taste, &amp;c. which serve to distinguish the bile from the other inquiline humours belonging to the system; and from the same source must we also derive the other remarkable properties of this fluid, which shall be mentioned hereafter.</P>

<P>The bile is not of such a nature as to possess, like soap, an equal affinity to oil and water, and thus serve to mix and intimately combine these two elements together. The contrary opinion (which was erroneously entertained on this subject by Boerhaave, and afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Schroder) was formerly invalidated and refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d by certain re∣markable experiments of my own (since confirmed
<PB N="43" REF="028310_0387_0FDAB7F5616C7520"/>
and further increased by other writers), and is now entirely repudiated by the greater number of physiologists. On the other hand, if bile be ap∣plied to the two foregoing elements, i. e. oil and water, when in a state of intimate mixture and combination, it produces an evident disunion and separation of them from each other. This fluid possesses indeed no alkaline properties, but is, not∣withstanding, equally unfriendly to the existence of acid acrimony, to fermentation, and to putre∣faction.</P>

<HEAD>§ 392.</HEAD>
<P>By considering with due attention the foregoing observations, we may easily ascertain the true, the important, and the diversified uses of the bile, in the process of chylification.</P>
<P>For in the first place, from that equable and uniform chymous pulp which the stomach has dis∣charged into the duodenum, which the pancreas has diluted by an effusion of its own juice, and which moves spontaneously onward to the cavity of the small intestines, it gradually precipitates the faeces, and thus separates from them that cream-like fluid denominated <HI>chyle.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="028310_0388_0FDAB7FA20978D38"/>The bile itself suffers, at the same time, a divi∣sion into two parts, the one aqueous, the other phlogistic. The latter part adheres to the faece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, tinges them, and is afterwards discharged, along with them, out of the body; whereas he former appears to be mixed with the chyle, and re-con∣ducted back to the mass of blood.</P>
<P>Thus the abundant phlogiston, now become troublesome and noxious to the blood, is first di∣rected to the liver, where it is rendered subservient to the formation of a singular and very important humour: After this humour has fully answered the end of its destination, its superfluous, or rather noxious part is included among the excrements, and finally eliminated from the system.</P>
<P>A further use of the bile is, to evolve and ex∣terminate from the alimentary canal, the fixed air, which had been hitherto confined among the chy∣mous mass: it appears also to act on, and aid, the intestinal tube, by means of its stimulus, thus ex∣citing it to perform its peristaltic motion with greater vigour and energy.</P>
<P>I silently pretermit a variety of other uses, com∣monly attributed to the bile, which appear to me to rest on more doubtful and equivocal evidence,
<PB N="45" REF="028310_0389_0FDAB7FB616A7D38"/>
such, for instance, as its power of regurgitating into the stomach when empty, and thus exciting appetite, a phenomenon that, in my opinion, can very seldom occur in a well formed and healthy human subject.</P>

<P>For notwithstanding the continuations of the <HI>peritoneum,</HI> in the abdominal cavity, be almost innu∣merable, and although all the parts contained in this cavity, whether viewed collectively or indivi∣dually, be so uniformly invested by it, that, on opening the abdomen, it is impossible to discover a single viscus which this membrane does not em∣brace, yet the modes in which it furnishes this
<PB N="51" REF="028310_0395_0FDAB80EF7ABD4C0"/>
covering to the several viscera, are so diversified, as to merit a division into different classes.</P>
<P>Thus, for example, the abdominal cavity con∣tains certain parts, over which the peritoneum is only spread in such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> partial and simple manner, as to invest but one of their surfaces; this obser∣vation may be applied particularly to the kidneys, the <HI>intestinum rectum,</HI> the <HI>vesica urinaria,</HI> and in some measure also, to the pancreas and gall-bladder.</P>
<P>There are also other viscera, which, notwith∣standing their attachment and adhesion to the sur∣rounding parietes of the abdomen, yet project also to a considerable distance into the abdominal ca∣vity itself, and derive from the peritoneum a co∣vering, which invests, by far, the greater part of their external surfaces: of this description are the liver, the spleen, and even the stomach and female uterus, to which we may add, finally, the testes of a male foetus, previously to their descent into the scrotum.</P>
<P>Considerably different again, (in point of peri∣toneal covering), from both the foregoing classes of viscera, is the whole of the intestinal tube, ex∣cept that portion which is denominated <HI>intestinum rectum.</HI> This tube passes through the adominal
<PB N="52" REF="028310_0396_0FDAB8160D1A4750"/>
cavity in such a manner, as to carry along with its two remarkably broad processes of the peritoneum, namely the <HI>mesentery</HI> and <HI>mesocolon,</HI> to which it adheres in a state of suspension: under the same class with the two preceding processes, may we also arrange those singular peritoneal productions, denominated the broad ligaments of the uterus.</P>

<P>But finally, the most extensive of all is that pe∣culiar continuation of the peritoneum called the <HI>omentum.</HI> This production is a large empty sac of a very delicate texture, that hangs in a depend∣ing position from the great curvature of the sto∣mach; it is spread over the region of the <HI>small in∣testines</HI> in particular, nicely adapts itself to their irregular convexities, and dips down, in some measure, into their numerous interstices.</P>

<P>It has been the opinion of certain celebrated characters, and a further attempt was made by the illustrious Haller to prove, that the fat con∣tained in the omentum is destined to be taken up by absorption and conveyed to the liver, for the purpose of supplying the bile with its oily portion, &amp;c. With respect to the truth of this opinion, however, I must still be permitted to entertain and express a serious doubt, having never yet been convinced that sound, uncontaminated, bile con∣tains any oil; nor have I ever been able to disco∣ver any orifices subservient to such an absorption, not even in frogs themselves, where Malpighi al∣leged, and even attempted to prove, their exis∣tence; much less in that part which is the subject of our present consideration, namely, the omentum of man.</P>

facilitate their perpetual motion. The same ap∣pear also to be the use and destination of certain similar, but small, adipose <HI>bursae,</HI> by which the <HI>colon</HI> and <HI>rectum</HI> are invested.</P>

<DIV3 N="409" TYPE="part">

<P>That this adipose curtain is destined to serve as a defence against cold, (though an opinion very generally received), appears, notwithstanding, to rest on evidence of a more questionable nature: the omentum of a man in perfect health, which ought by no means to be burthened with an accu∣mulation of fat, is indeed, but very illy calculated to answer such an intention.</P>

<P>The jejunum from that of its general habit, be∣cause, in a recent corpse, it appears collapsed and empty as it were, even although it contain at the same time a quantity of pulpy chyme.

<PB N="56" REF="028310_0400_0FDAB822079158F0"/>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="412" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 412.</HEAD>
<P>The coats of the small intestines are perfectly similar to those composing the stomach, of which we have already spoken (§ 359.)</P>
<P>The <HI>external</HI> is a production of the mefentery.</P>
<P>The <HI>muscular</HI> coat consists of two orders of fibres, to wit, <HI>longitudinal,</HI> which are interrupted in their course, and run rather <HI>externally,</HI> especi∣ally on that side of the intestine that looks in a contrary direction from the mesentery; and more <HI>internal, annular,</HI> or <HI>falciform</HI> fibres, which are calculated to contract or narrow the diameter of the tube; whereas the former are intended to di∣minish its longitudinal extent. On both the pre∣ceding orders of fibres depends that exquisitely energetic and pertinacious <HI>irritability</HI> of the intes∣tines, of which we have spoken on a former occa∣sion (§ 306.)</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="028310_0401_0FDAB828BB1BD600"/>The <HI>nervous</HI> coat consists of compacted cellular membrane; and may, by a very simple mode of treatment, especially by blowing into it, be again reduced to a spongy, foam-like tissue: throughout this coat a variety of blood-vessels, detached from the mesenteric, are distributed in the form of ar∣borets or branching shrubs, of inimitable elegance and beauty. As in the stomach, so likewise in the intestines, the nervous coat is the principal seat of tenacity and strength.</P>
<P>Finally, the internal coat (which merits more unequivocally, in the small intestines, than in any other part of the alimentary canal, the name <HI>vil∣lous),</HI> is continued here and there, in conjunction with the internal surface of the preceding mem∣brane, into wave-like productions and rugous folds, that in the intestines, when inflated and dried, exhibit a falciform appearance, and are de∣nominated valvulae Kerkringii.</P>

<PB N="58" REF="028310_0402_0FDAB82B62D8BEF0"/>
in some measure to small purses hanging in a loose and flaccid position, and consisting internally of a soft spongy texture; but when they become tur∣gid, in consequence of the absorption of this milky fluid from the intestinal canal, their figure undergoes such a striking change, as to bear no small resemblance to the <HI>phallus esculentus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A species of <HI>fungus,</HI> denominated <HI>phallus,</HI> from its strik∣ing similitude to the male penis.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Those <HI>villi</HI> are surrounded, at their bases, by an infinitude of <HI>small glandular follicles,</HI> which are lodged principally in the nervous coat, and com∣municate by very minute orifices with the intesti∣nal cavity, into which they discharge a mucus that serves to line and lubricate the whole internal sur∣face of that tube.</P>
<P>These minute glands are commonly supposed to consist of three orders. <HI>First,</HI> the Brunnerian or larger glands, which are separate from each other, and situated principally on that part of the duode∣num, which lies next to the pylorus.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> the Peyerian, which are considerably smaller, planted in clusters, and lodged, in parti∣cular, on the other extremity of the small intes∣tines,
<PB N="59" REF="028310_0403_0FDAB83953517328"/>
which looks towards, and is contiguous to, the valve of the colon.</P>
<P>And, <HI>lastly,</HI> the glands of Leiberkuhn, the most minute of all, of which about eight are said to be∣long to each <HI>vilius.</HI></P>
<P>It ought to be observed, however, that this di∣vision of the sources of mucus appears to rest on very equivocal evidence. For if I be not greatly deceived, both the Brunnerian and Peyerian glands, as commonly exhibited in plates, are the result of a vitiated and diseased state of the intesti∣nal tube. I am induced to entertain this opinion from having never been able to discover, in the sound small intestines of subjects carefully exami∣ned in different periods of life, the smallest vestige of such fungous papillae, perforated with orifices; whereas, on the other hand, I have frequently seen, in cases of <HI>aphtha,</HI> almost the whole intesti∣nal canal planted with countless numbers of them, partly standing alone, and partly arranged in crouded clusters. From considering the foregoing circumstances, I feel a confidence in concluding, that none can be accounted true muciferous glands, except those extremely minute miliary bo∣dies, which, on gently separating the <HI>villous lining,</HI> may be readily detected on its <HI>averted surface,</HI> but

<P>It has been incontrovertibly established, not only from that well known experiment first insti∣tuted (if I mistake not) by Pechlin, but also from several others, that as the stomach, so in like manner the cavity of the small intestines, is sup∣plied with a constant influx of a liquid, denomi∣nated, from the place into which it is discharged, <HI>intestinal juice.</HI> It appears probable that this fluid is similar in its nature to the gastric liquor, al∣though a more accurate investigation of it is, cer∣tainly as yet, a desideratum in physiology: nei∣ther can I venture to say any thing decisive re∣specting the <HI>quantity</HI> of this liquid secreted: I am, however, fully of opinion, that Haller has been too profuse in his estimate, where he alleges, that this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retion amounts to eight pounds in the space of twenty-four hours.</P>

<P>Further, it is also common to the intestines with the stomach, to be agitated by a <HI>similar,</HI> but far more <HI>lively</HI> and vigorous <HI>peristaltic motion,</HI> which, in particular, while the chymous pulp is advancing, onward, throws the same into gentle commotion,

by a wavy and progressive constriction, and thus propels it forward from the duodenum towards the great intestines. For although we cannot ab∣solutely deny the phenomenon of an anti-peristal∣tic commotion, in consequence of which the intes∣tines are subjected to a retrograde action, it must, notwithstanding, be acknowledged, that this, in a healthy subject, is much feebler than the former, that it occurs more rarely, and possesses a more precarious and short-lived existence.</P>

<P>These, therefore, after having become more and more inspissated, in consequence of a tedious course through the ileum, are obliged at length to pass the valve of the colon, and thus enter the tract of the <HI>great intestines;</HI> for which purpose the neigh∣bouring extremity of the ileum is furnished, and lubricated internally, by a more copious quantity of mucus, destined to destroy the friction of the faeces, and consequently facilitate their transition through the foregoing valve.</P>

<P>The <HI>valve of the colon</HI> (denominated very justly in honour of its real and illustrious discoverer, <HI>valvula Fallopii),</HI> is a short continuation or process of the <HI>ileum</HI> projecting into the cavity of the great <HI>intestinal portion,</HI> by which it is surrounded and closely embraced: the more exterior <HI>labia</HI> of this <HI>process</HI> are so constituted, by means of a more

<P>FROM observations delivered in a for∣mer section it is sufficiently evident, that the chyle, which we left in the <HI>intestinum ileum,</HI> completely disengaged from its faeces, is a compound of seve∣ral different humours. Although it be almost li∣terally impossible to calculate, with accuracy and definitude, the precise quantity of <HI>inquiline hu∣mours,</HI> such as saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic juice, intestinal juice, bile, &amp;c. that is mixed and blended
<PB N="66" REF="028310_0410_0FDAB85701B18090"/>
with the chyme, it appears, notwithstanding, a matter of the highest credibility, that these several humours, taken collectively, very far exceed, in quantity, the other constituent part of the chyle, which is derived immediately from alimentary sub∣stances, recently taken as nutriment. Hence we may derive a solution of that problem in physio∣logy, by what means alimentary matters, though of the most different and even opposite kinds, may, notwithstanding, be converted into the same assimi∣lized, homogeneous, and milk-like chyle, equally adapted to the <HI>nature,</HI> and calculated to serve as the <HI>nutriment,</HI> of animals?</P>

<P>The <HI>channels</HI> through which the chyle must flow, in its passage from the intestines to the <HI>mass of blood,</HI> (the reservoir destined for its ultimate re∣ception), constitute a part of the <HI>absorbent system,</HI> which we have hitherto mentioned only occasion∣ally, and in a very cursory manner, but will now assume as the professed object of our present at∣tention. This system is divided generally into four parts, viz. lacteal veins; lymphatic veins; conglobate glands; and finally, the thoracic duct, each of which shall constitute a subject of exclu∣sive consideration.</P>

<P>With respect to the nascent origin of the lac∣teals from the intestines, there exists scarcely a doubt, but that this is constituted by the innume∣rable <HI>villi</HI> of the internal intestinal coat, of which we have already spoken. It is, however, still a matter of controversy, whether the lacteals origi∣nate immediately from those villi themselves, or only preserve a more distant intercourse and com∣munication with them, by means of interjacent cellular substance. As far as my information has extended, no one has hitherto been able, more than myself, to trace the evanescent radicles of the lacteal vessels to the villi themselves, with such clearness and definitude, as to discover an imme∣diate and unequivocal connection between the parts; on the other hand, the lacteals appear here and there, throughout the coats of the intestines, to form trunks of considerable size, immediately after their orgin, and, (if a conjecture be allow∣able), to absorb from the cellular substance of the adjacent parts, that chyle which had been origi∣nally taken up from the cavity of the intestines by means of the villi themselves. This phenomenon I think I have frequently observed, in young pup∣pies, into which I had poured, according to the celebrated experiment of Lister, a solution of In∣dian blue, one or two hours before subjecting them to the operation of <HI>live-dissection.</HI></P>

<P>Those trunks, of which we have just spoken, frequently run the distance of several inches, and sometimes even wind about in angling or mean∣der-like directions, immediately under the external coat of the intestine, previously to their entrance into the mesentery.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="428" TYPE="part">

<P>During their passage through the mesentery, these trunks make frequent entrances into small <HI>mesenteric glands,</HI> which may be divided into two different <HI>series</HI> or <HI>orders.</HI> Those of the first order are situated in the vicinity of the intestinal tube, and resemble, in their appearance, small beans ly∣ing separate from each other.

<P>It has been proposed as a physiological question, whether or not the <HI>large,</HI> possess also lacteal veins, in common with the <HI>small</HI> intestines? The affirma∣tive of this has been zealously advocated, and its defence attempted by arguments drawn from the influence and efficacy of specific enemas, of ene∣mas composed of nutrimental substances, of ine∣briating substances, &amp;c. and also from the follow∣ing well known circumstance, viz. that the longer inspissated faeces are retained in the large portion of the alimentary canal, the more indurated and insucculent they are uniformly found. But al∣though these arguments do not satisfactorily de∣monstrate that any genuine chyle is absorbed from the faeces after their transition over the valve of Fallopius, they furnish, notwithstanding, additional evidence in confirmation of that, which has indeed been long since established on the testimony of the sense of vision itself, namely, that the great in∣testines abound with a sufficiently plentiful appa∣ratus of lymphatic veins, perfectly similar to the lacteals both in their structure and functions: in testimony of this entire similarity, it may be proper to observe, that when the intestines are destitute
<PB N="70" REF="028310_0414_0FDAB86536719F40"/>
of chyle, the lacteals of the mesentery are then engaged in the absorption of lymph.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="431" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 431.</HEAD>
<P>Another question, more important and difficult of solution than the former, is, whether or not the whole of the chyle, absorbed from the cavity of the small intestines, be conveyed to the blood through the same <HI>public,</HI> and <HI>royal</HI> route, as it is termed, or whether there do not exist certain se∣cret channels, through which it may glide surrep∣titiously onward, to mingle its streamlets with the general current of circulating blood?</P>
<P>It must indeed, be confessed, that most of the arguments, by which physiologists have endea∣voured to prove a private absorption and convey∣ance of chyle through the sanguiferous veins, do not appear to rest on a very solid foundation: thus the assertion of Ruysch, that on the approach of old age the mesenteric glands become so indu∣rated and constricted, as to be rendered unfit for performing their functions, has been long since re∣futed, and it has, on the other hand, been satis∣factorily demonstrated that, different affections of these glands, such as swellings, &amp;c. very errone∣ously pass under the common name of <HI>obstructions,</HI> while, at the same time, their vessels remain in a state sufficiently pervious to afford a very easy en∣trance
<PB N="71" REF="028310_0415_0FDAB86988254808"/>
and transition to injections of quick silver. That well known phenomenon, from which it is ascertained, that tepid water, thrown into the inert mesenteric veins of a dead subject, transudes into the cavity of the intestines, appears to contribute but very little towards the satisfactory elucidation of any function of the human body while in a living state; much less can we repose confidence in the evidence derived from that <HI>bicrural</HI> and <HI>two branched</HI> tube of copper, which was invented by Lieberkuhn, for the purpose of confirming the same opinion. As to the assertion, that chyle has been unequivocally detected in the red veins of the mesentery, it appears to me to stand in need of farther evidence for its unquestionable confir∣mation; on the whole, I have never yet been convinced, that those veins convey any thing else than blood very highly charged with phlogiston, destined for the secretion of bile.</P>

<P>Finally, the ultimate trunks of the lacteal veins, (with certain other tubes very similar in appear∣ance and function, which are formed by the con∣fluence of a great number of minute lymphatic ves∣sels), unite and constitute by their junction, the <HI>receptacle</HI> or <HI>cistern of the chyle,</HI> which is a name given by physiologists to the inferior and larger

<DIV3 N="433" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 433.</HEAD>
<P>This duct is a membranous canal, of a delicate appearance and texture, yet sufficiently robust and strong, more or less circuitous in its course, and not unfrequently subject to very striking diversities with regard to the direction in which it runs, and the divisions it occasionally undergoes: it is equal∣ly destitute of muscular fibres and nerves, is fur∣nished here and there with small valves, and, after having passed over the <HI>left subclavian vein,</HI> is again reflected towards, and finally inserted into, the <HI>same,</HI> and, at the very point of insertion, has its entrance guarded by a valve of a peculiar struc∣ture.</P>

<P>The powers which produce and continue the onward motion of the chyle, both in the lacteal veins, and through the thoracic duct, are to be attributed, indeed, principally to the contractility of these vessels themselves, but, in part also, to the valves with which they are furnished, to a propulsive <HI>vis a tergo,</HI> and to the uninterrupted pulsation of neighbouring arteries.</P>

<P>It appears probable, that the principal destina∣tion of the valve, which is fixed, as has been al∣ready observed, in the entrance of the chyliferous duct into the subclavian vein, is not so much to obstruct the lateral passage of blood into this duct, as to regulate the necessary discharge of chyle in∣to the vein, and prevent its admission in any other manner than by a slow and gradual stillicidium.</P>
<P>By this means, adequate provision is made against the simultaneous entrance of too large a quantity of recent chyle, into the mass of blood. Such an excessive influx of this crude fluid would necessarily stimulate the <HI>parietes</HI> of the heart to ex∣ertions too violent and laborious, and would be blended and assimilated by the same, with the ut∣most difficulty, and in an imperfect manner; that this would be the result, we judge from the nature of recent chyle, which is a compound of hetero∣geneous elements, derived not only from the <HI>pri∣mae viae,</HI> by means of the <HI>lacteal,</HI> but also from all the other parts of the body, through the ave∣nues of the <HI>lymphatic vessels.</HI></P>

<P>The manner in which they arise, is similar to the origin of the lacteals from the intestines, of which we have already spoken.

<P>To pass silently over certain other aids, suffici∣ently evident from former observations, the func∣tion of the lymphatics is greatly promoted by their remarkable contractility, and the <HI>strength</HI> of their delicate coats, which is sufficient, in processes for anatomical preparations, to resist the pressure from a ponderous column of quick silver: this function is also further aided, especially in the joints, by <HI>muscular motion,</HI> in consequence of which, the lymphatics being compressed and closely embraced on all sides, have their tone remarkably aug∣mented.</P>

<P>Seeing therefore, the lymphatic vessels are extended far and wide throughout almost the whole system, and, especially, in as much as an immense profusion of them originate on the cuta∣neous surface of the body, and may consequently absorb such fluids as are applied from without, it is sufficiently evident, that the lymph, when re∣cently absorbed, must be, indeed, a liquid compo∣sition extremely heterogeneous and diversified as

<P>The internal structure of the heart itself appears also to contribute, not a little, towards the im∣portant process of sanguification. Thus, by means of those astonishing muscular papillae, with which the ventricles of the heart are plentifully fur∣nished, the blood and chyle (having recently met together), are thoroughly agitated, and brought into state of more intimate combination.</P>

<P>But although potent provision be made, by such powerful and diversified <HI>apparatus,</HI> for blend∣ing and intimately incorporating the chyle with the blood, it appears, notwithstanding, that there exists a certain similarity between the constituent parts of those two fluids. It is very commonly asserted, that a great many hours must elapse be∣fore the chyle can be completely divested of its own milky colour, and perfectly assimilated to <HI>that</HI> of the crimson fluid into which it is destined to be converted: in testimony of the truth of this asser∣tion, medical philosophers usually adduce (besides other arguments) the following singular patholo∣gical phenomenon, namely, that several hours after the close of digestion, genuine chyle has been fre∣quently observed to flow from an orifice made in a vein of the human body: this phenomenon I have indeed had an opportunity of observing my∣self; but it was at the same time extremely evi∣dent, that the blood was then highly charged with phlogiston (a condition of this fluid very un∣friendly to the regular assimilation of chyle), so that from hence scarcely any inference can be drawn relative <HI>to the healthy state</HI> of the system, which is alone the exclusive subject of the science of physiology.</P>

<P>Nutrition is that faculty of our bodies, on which all the sublime and astonishing functions of our na∣ture depend.

<P>With respect to the nature and mode of this <HI>wasting</HI> or loss, various controversies have existed among physiologists. The more immediate point of disputation has been, whether such waste occurs in the solid parts of our bodies, or whether it be not more probable, that those parts, when once formed and completed, remain stationary, without
<PB N="85" REF="028310_0429_0FDAB8A22B733EC8"/>
being subject either to vitiation or change? which latter is indeed an opinion embraced and taught by several characters of the utmost acumen and ingenuity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="458" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 458.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to some particular solid parts of the body, such, for example, as the epidermis, the nails, &amp;c. there exists indeed not a shadow of doubt, but that they are gradually destroyed and again repaired; and with regard to the destruction or waste and subsequent reparation of the bones themselves, the testimony will appear equally plain and conclusive, to any one who may consider with attention the result of the well known experiments made by feeding warm-blooded animals, for some time, on the root of the <HI>rubia tinctorum,</HI> or who may take the further trouble of contemplating attentively the phenomena exhibited by certain large plain bones, especially those of the cranium, which in extreme old age become remarkably attenuated, or diminished in thickness, in conse∣quence of the scanty nourishment with which they are supplied at that period of life.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="459" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 450.</HEAD>
<P>Upon the whole, if I be capable of judging rightly, those solid parts appear to be not only gradually consumed, and again repaired, by the
<PB N="86" REF="028310_0430_0FDAB8A74653BC58"/>
faculty of nutrition, but possess also a <HI>vis repro∣ductiva,</HI> or power of re-production. This latter is indeed a surprising faculty, destined not only to make restitution for the uniform removal of minute atoms by the necessary action of the animal economy, but also to repair the incidental loss of larger parts (suffered in consequence of external injuries, wounds, &amp;c.), by a perfect restoration of the substance of which the body has been thus forcibly deprived. That such a power does un∣equivocally reside in the bones, and a few other parts, of which we have just spoken, is with me too well ascertained and substantiated to admit of a doubt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="460" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 460.</HEAD>
<P>But on the other hand, from a variety of obser∣vations and experiments which I have made both on man and other warm-blooded animals, this <HI>power of reproduction</HI> appears to reside in scarcely any other solid parts of the body than <HI>such as are endowed with contractility alone, without possessing at the same time any of the other vital energies, such as irritability, sensibility, or finally, specific life.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="461" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 461.</HEAD>
<P>Of those parts of the system therefore (which possess the more exalted kinds of vital energy), the staminal basis appears to me to consist of a <HI>pe∣rennial
<PB N="87" REF="028310_0431_0FDAB8A8A1F6C748"/>
parenchyma,</HI> which is subject neither to genuine mutation nor decay, but only liable to certain <HI>vicissitudes</HI> in point of bulk, that are pro∣duced in the following manner, namely, when the process of nutrition is conducted with suffi∣cient activity and vigour, the cellular interstices of the parenchyma, being uniformly filled with the rich and plastic lymph of the blood, are, of course, dis∣tended, and the parenchyma necessarily enlarged; but when, on the other hand, nutrition goes on less favourably, these same interstices, being in a great measure deprived of this nutritious lymph, fall into a state of collapse, and the parts become consequently diminished in size.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="462" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 462.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to this plastic lymph (of the dig∣nity and importance of which we have spoken fully on a former occasion), as it assumes with great facility the appearance and nature of genuine cellular membrane, so it appears to constitute ge∣nerally the principal nutritious matter of the whole system, and is conveyed to every part of the body by means of that infinitude of minute blood-vessels, to which we have so often called the reader's attention.</P>

<P>During the time of the body's advancement in growth, it appears to possess certain peculiar or specific powers, by the aid of which the lymph, being deposited from the evanescent extremities of the sanguiferous vessels, into the surrounding cellular membrane, is duly arranged, and com∣pletely assimilated to each particular portion, and kind of parenchyma. To the head of these specific powers, must we in part refer that particular law of affinity, by means of which the <HI>partes similares</HI> of the system attract and appropriate to themselves, the homogeneous <HI>elements</HI> of the nutritious lymph, more especially such of them, as possess reciprocal and kindred propensities; and to the same head may we also in part refer that <HI>nisus formativus,</HI> of which we will have occasion to speak more fully hereafter, and to which must be attributed, the just and specific application of the rude, and hi∣therto formless, elementary matter, and its subse∣quent organisation and arrangement into the form and figure of its peculiar destination.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="464" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 464.</HEAD>
<P>It is, I presume, from the joint co-operation of both the preceding powers, that we must princi∣pally derive the nutrition of those parts of the body, which are not proximately supplied with any

blood vessels at all; such as the nails, hairs, &amp;c. and which are, notwithstanding, generated at first, by a very powerful and truly infallible <HI>nisus</HI> or ex∣ertion, are afterwards advanced in magnitude, and regularly supported by nutriment throughout the whole of life, and, finally, if by accident removed, are again readily restored by the astonishing efforts of the <HI>vis reproductiva.</HI></P>

<P>Although the preceding appears to be a general <HI>breviate account</HI> of the process of nutrition, yet, on the other hand, it is evident that there exists, in different individuals, a great many varieties, with regard to the degrees and modes in which this function is discharged. Thus, for example, in proportion as a more lax or more close <HI>apposition</HI> and <HI>union</HI> of the nutritious matter are effected, the texture of the parts themselves is rendered more dense or delicate, and hence also seems to origi∣nate the difference between the specific weight of human bodies; in which respect it is well known, not only that man differs from man, but even nation from nation: in testimony of this truth it may be sufficient to adduce even a solitary example from among certain northern tribes, namely, the Jukutae, the Buratae, &amp;c. people highly conspi∣cuous on account of the remarkable and truly sin∣gular levity of their bodies.</P>

<DIV3 N="466" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 466.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES those juices destined for the important process of nutrition, there are also in the animal system other humours, of a very different order and character, which are extracted for various purposes from the exuberant fountain of the blood. These humours owe their exis∣tence to the process of secretion, than which no function is less understood by physiologists; a <HI>truth</HI> mentioned as a subject of just regret, both by the immortal Haller and other preceding writers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="467" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 467.</HEAD>
<P>The secreted humours, appear, in one point of view, to be so extremely diversified in their na∣tures, and, in another, to bear so striking an affi∣nity to each other, that it is not possible to reduce them to any, save highly arbitrary, <HI>classes.</HI> If, however, in treating of these humours, we found our divisions of them on the less and greater changes to which their elementary parts, (con∣tained
<PB N="91" REF="028310_0435_0FDAB8BC274F33B0"/>
in the mass of blood), are subjected in the secretory organs, they may be aptly enough enu∣merated in the following order.</P>
<P>First, <HI>the milk,</HI> a fluid which we think proper to place at the head of our <HI>census</HI> or enumeration, because it may be considered, in some measure, as renovated chyle, and appears to be secreted, by the most simple process, from the blood, to which the chyle had been recently united.</P>
<P>Secondly, the <HI>aqueous fluids;</HI> such, for exam∣ple, as the humours of the eye, and the tears: to the same head must we refer in like manner, the sweat; and also, (if our opinion be not un∣founded), that halitus which is contained gene∣rally in the interstices of the cellular membrane, as well as in the cavities of the thorax and abdo∣men: this vapour appears to differ but very little either from the liquor of the pericardium, or from that subtle halitus by which the ventricles of the brain, and the pituitary sinuses of the cranium are preserved in a state of perpetual humidity.</P>
<P>Under the same head of aqueous fluids, it is likewise common to arrange the <HI>urine,</HI> although this is doubtless a liquid possessed of some singu∣larly striking and peculiar properties.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="028310_0244_0FDAB631E7198580"/>Of a less compound nature are the <HI>salivary</HI> humours, which, in office, are subservient to mas∣tication, to digestion, and to chylification.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the <HI>mucagenous fluids,</HI> which invest and lubricate the cavities of most of the viscera, that are destined to the performance of the natural and genital functions, and also the internal surfaces of all the aerial avenues belonging to the system, such as the <HI>nares,</HI> the <HI>larynx,</HI> and the <HI>aspera arteria.</HI></P>
<P>Of a nature not widely different from the fore∣going, is that portion of mucus which covers the internal segment of the eyeball; as well as that which is spread immediately beneath the epi∣dermis.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the <HI>adipose humours</HI> are, in particular, (besides the common fat itself), the medulla of the bones, and the smegma or oily covering of the skin, to which may be added the <HI>cerumen aurium,</HI> or waxlike substance investing the external ave∣nues of the ears.</P>
<P>Of a nature nearly related to the foregoing, is that unctuous secretion, so evident on the <HI>glans penis</HI> of the male, and about the <HI>rima</HI> or <HI>os exter∣num,</HI> in the genital organs of the female.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="028310_0245_0FDAB4CDAEC0C000"/>Under the same class may we also arrange that oily substance, with which the glands of Meibo∣mius furnish and anoint the eyelids.</P>
<P>Fifthly, what are commonly denominated by physiologists <HI>gelatinous fluids,</HI> examples of which we have in the <HI>liquor amnii,</HI> and <HI>unguen</HI> of the joints. Respecting the nature of these fluids, however, we are not yet possessed of a sufficient number of well authenticated facts to give birth to unequivocal and satisfactory conclusions: a similar observation may also be made, respecting that uninvestigated and anonymous humour, which the female uterus discharges during the ardent glow of the venereal orgasm.</P>
<P>We remain also as yet, in a state of equal un∣certainty respecting the nature of that fluid, which is lodged, during the first months after conception, between the chorion and amnios; of that which is contained in the umbilical <HI>vesicula</HI> or <HI>pouch</HI> of the embryo in its tenderest state; and also of that which is interposed between the three vessels that constitute the umbilical cord.</P>
<P>The liquid enclosed in the <HI>vesiculae grassianae</HI> of the female ovary, and also the liquor of the pros∣tate gland, appear to be of a truly <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rous</HI> or <HI>albu∣minous</HI> nature.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="028310_0246_0FDAB4D16A7965D8"/>Sixthlly, the <HI>male semen</HI> appears to be a <HI>humour</HI> so remarkably singular in its nature, as not to admit of classification, nor even of comparison, with any other.</P>
<P>And lastly, with regard to the <HI>bile,</HI> there is equal room for the admission of a similar obser∣vation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="468" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 468.</HEAD>
<P>That the foregoing secreted humours, so ex∣tremely diversified in their natures and habits, can neither be derived from the mass of blood by the same individual process, nor by organs of the same kind, is a proposition too self-evident to stand in need of, or indeed leave room for, any farther confirmation. Among these humours, there ob∣viously exists this memorable variety, namely, that while some of them are secreted and conveyed from the blood through a <HI>shorter route,</HI> others again, are more elaborately prepared, by being carried onward through tubes of greater longitu∣dinal extension.</P>

<P>Of all the modes of secretion, <HI>that</HI> must doubt∣less be considered as the most simple, in which the secreted humour appears to transude immediately through the coats of the arteries, by what physi∣ologists
<PB N="95" REF="028310_0247_0FDAB4F79871F328"/>
call <HI>diapedesis.</HI> Instances of this mode we have in the secretion of the fat, and of the medulla residing in the bones, &amp;c.; and, finally, it appears to be by a modification of the secretory process, not greatly dissimilar to the foregoing, that the gastric liquor, the intestinal liquor, &amp;c. are pre∣pared and discharged into the cavities of their respective viscera.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="470" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 470.</HEAD>
<P>The mechanism of secretion appears to be more compound, where that process is performed by mean of <HI>glands,</HI> under which denomination we generally include even <HI>follicles</HI> and <HI>cryptae</HI> them∣selves; such, for example, as are easily discover∣able in the fauces; and which physiologists gene∣rally de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by the name of <HI>glandulae sim∣plissia▪</HI></P>
<P>We bestow, with propriety, the denomination of secreting glands, on those bodies which, (to distinguish them from the <HI>conglobate,</HI> belonging to the lymphatic system), are called <HI>conglomerate;</HI> ex∣amples of which we have in the salivary glands, in the pancreas, in the lachrymal glands, and in the <HI>mammae,</HI> or breasts of females. The foregoing glandular bodies are furnished with excretory ducts, which are composed of tubes or canals running immediately from their larger lobes: these
<PB N="96" REF="028310_0248_0FDAB51BA39319F8"/>
lobes, on being submitted to farther examination, are found to be made up of smaller lobules, re∣specting the internal structure of which, there for∣merly existed very warm controversies in some of the most celebrated schools of medicine. Malpig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> considered the small miliary globules, which may be readily demonstrated in the greater part of them, to be nothing else than genuine <HI>aci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i</HI> or <HI>kernels,</HI> containing, each one, a minute cavity in its centre. While Ruysch contended, on the other hand, that those hypothetical excavated kernels were nothing more than globular convo∣lutions of extremely fine blood vessels; which lat∣ter opinion, is doubtless founded on by far the most unequivocal and substantial testimony, as we readily learn from well conducted anatomical investigations, more especially from successful injections, and the assistance of glasses.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="471" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 471.</HEAD>
<P>Nor does this structure (if indeed we keep out of view the peculiar parenchyma of each parti∣cular viscus), differ much from, but appears rather to shed a considerable gleam of light on, the struc∣ture of certain other secreting viscera, particularly on that of the liver and kidneys, in which late ex∣perimenters have been able to demonstrate, with the utmost perspicuity, certain spherical bodies entirely similar to the globular convolutions of
<PB N="97" REF="028310_0249_0FDAB521780F6120"/>
Ruysch, or the kernel-like substances of the cele∣brated Malpighi. For, in what is called the cortical portion of those viscera, minute ramifications emerg∣ing from the sides of the small capillary arteries, be∣come presently convoluted, in such a manner, as to form little vascular balls, which thus appear to hang by those ramifications of which they are composed▪ like so many small berries or grapes supported by their footstalks. From these minute vascular balls originate <HI>first,</HI> that very subtle and colourless order of vessels immediately destined for the busi∣ness of secretion. (respecting the origin of which, from the evanescent terminations of arteries, we transiently spoke on a former occasion, (§ 79-81.); and <HI>secondly,</HI> the incipient radicles of veins, into which the minute arteries are themselves continuously reflected, and which conduct back to the venous trunks, the residue of the blood now deprived of those elementary particles neces∣sary to constitute the fluid recently secreted.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="472" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 472.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, certain other parts of the body, appro∣priated entirely to the business of secretion, are distinguished again by different and remarkably peculiar, species of organization; thus the male testes, for example, are wholly composed of no∣thing else than close and mazy convolutions of very lengthy and numerous blood vessels, &amp;c.</P>

<P>We come now to the consideration of the pe∣culiar causes, by the operation and efficacy of which <HI>those</HI> determinate and specific humours are secreted in <HI>these</HI> corresponding determinate and specific organs: this is indeed the <HI>Gordian knot</HI>— this is by far the most difficult point of disquisition in the whole doctrine of secretion—that point which numerous doubts and difficulties yet invest.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="474" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 474.</HEAD>
<P>It appears indeed to be a truth ascertained and established beyond the faintest shadow of a doubt, that the leading, and what may be called the proximate cause of most of the secretions, must be sought for in the internal structure of the se∣treting organs themselves: under this head we must particularly consider, in the conglomerate glands and other secreting viscera, not only the peculiar distribution and direction of the extreme blood-vessels, from which the humours are se∣creted, but also the <HI>parenchyma,</HI> so uniformly proper to each secreting viscus, that in many of them it can be instantly known and distinguished at first sight from all other kinds or species of flesh (§ 27).</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="475" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 475.</HEAD>
<P>It is also an opinion extremely prob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble (in support of which we have advanced, on former
<PB N="99" REF="028310_0251_0FDAB527AF55D028"/>
occasions, several arguments not easily refuted), that the secreting viscera, besides their peculiar parenchyma, possess also what we have taken the liberty to call a <HI>vita propria,</HI> i. e. a specific or exclusive kind of vital energy, essentially different from what we denominated the three <HI>common energies,</HI> namely, contractility, irritability, and sen∣sibility.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="476" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 476.</HEAD>
<P>But further, if my views of the subject be in any measure just, the <HI>absorbent system</HI> appears to contribute also a very important part towards the promotion of the several secretions: thus, from each of the secreting viscera certain appropriate branches of this system absorb and re-convey to the blood-vessels larger or smaller portions of each of the several humours to which these viscera give origin; the uniform consequence of which is, that the blood becomes literally impregnated with the contagion of every humour secreted in the different parts of the body, e. g. with <HI>bile</HI> from the liver, with <HI>semen</HI> from the testes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus there appears to exist, in the system de∣stined for the business of secretion, a perpetual routine or circulation, so that the elementary parts of the humours already secreted being in∣cessantly conveyed from the secreting organs
<PB N="100" REF="028310_0252_0FDAB52924926570"/>
themselves, are united afresh to the mass of blood, and on their subsequent return to their <HI>parent organs,</HI> in conjunction with the sanguineous cur∣rent, are again more easily attracted by the se∣creting vessels, in consequence of a peculiar law of affinity, and have also a power of drawing along with them those parts of the blood that are most homogeneous in their nature, and for which they consequently possess the highest de∣gree of attraction.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="477" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 477.</HEAD>
<P>To facilitate the secretion of <HI>certain humours</HI> of the body, adequate provision is made by the production of specific qualities, in those particular portions of the blood from which they are to be proximately derived: thus the bile is secreted from the blood of the <HI>vena portarum,</HI> a portion of fluid highly impregnated with <HI>phlogiston,</HI> fur∣nished in profusion by the abdominal sources, from which this blood immediately originates.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="478" TYPE="part">

<P>I pass in silence over certain other co-operating aids, which act in subservience to particular seere∣tions, as <HI>congestion</HI> and <HI>derivation,</HI> so evidently efficacious in the secretion of milk, with other in∣stances of a similar nature.</P>

<P>Among the humours thus secreted by the or∣gans which we have just described, and by the powers or causes just enumerated, it may be ob∣served that the following difference afterwards exists, namely, while some of them drop imme∣diately from their secreting organs into the places of their ultimate destination, in which they are to perform their specific functions, others again are conveyed to appropriated receptacles, in which they are retained for some time, and thus farther matured previously to their final elimination from the system: of this last description is the milk which stagnates in the lactiferous ducts, the urine, the bile, and the semen masculinum, which are subjected to retention in their vesicular receptacles, and finally, the <HI>serum</HI> contained in those vesicles which were first discovered by de Graaff in the ovaria of the female.</P>

<P>The kidneys are two viscera situated behind the peritoneum, on each side of the spine, and in the upper part of the lumbar region: Although their figure is generally somewhat flatted, yet it is pro∣per to observe, that both in this respect, and also in point of number, they are subject to more va∣rieties than any other viscus belonging to the hu∣man body: they hang by vessels commonly called
<PB N="103" REF="028310_0255_0FDAB52DA6062180"/>

<P>They are invested by a proper membrane, of an elegant vascular structure: each one of them, especially during the period of infancy, appears to be composed of about eight, or somewhat more, kidney-form lobes or subdivisions; each of which consists again (according to an opinion formerly en∣tertained and taught by Ferrein), of about seventy or eighty fleshy <HI>radii,</HI> which that physiologist called white pyramids.</P>

<P>If the kidney be dissected or divided from its convex <HI>dorsum</HI> towards its concave <HI>pelvis,</HI> it ex∣hibits in its composition two kinds of substance; one forming its circumference, and therefore de∣nominated its <HI>cortical,</HI> the other constituting its centre, and hence called its <HI>medullary,</HI> portion.</P>
<P>Each portion abounds with sanguiferous arte∣ries and veins; besides <HI>which,</HI> the external cortex is also furnished with an additional order of very minute colourless vessels, destined to <HI>secrete</HI> the urine: while the medulla contains also vessels of

a similar description, intended to <HI>carry it onward</HI> when secreted.</P>
<P>Those secretory ducts originate, in the manner already described (§ 471.), from the small glo∣bular convolutions of capillary arteries that are every where interspersed throughout the cortex of the kidney: those ducts constitute indeed by far the greater portion of the cortical substance of the kidney, and may be very easily distinguished by their singular meanderings and intricate mazes, from the small conducting tubes of Bellini, in which they finally terminate. These <HI>tubuli Belliniani</HI> (as they are frequently termed) pass by a direct route from the cortical, and enter the medullary substance, of which they constitute by far the greater part; and uniting afterwards by reiterated coalitions into a small number of narrow trunks, finally perforate, by their extreme orifices, in a sieve-like manner, the several <HI>papillae</HI> contained in the renal pelvis.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="484" TYPE="part">

<P>The pelvis is continued into the <HI>ureters,</HI> which are membranous canals, exquisitely sensible, and defended internally by a complete investiture or lining of mucus; they are capable of extreme di∣latation; in man they are here and there uneven in the width of their cavities, and are at length inserted into the posterior surface, not far from the neck of the urinary bladder. This insertion is effected in such a manner, that the ureters do not immediately perforate the parietes of the uri∣nary cyst, but descend a short distance between its muscular and nervous coats (which are here possessed of more than ordinary thickness), and open finally into the cavity of this organ by ob∣lique orifices. By means of this structure, ade∣quate provision is made to prevent the urine, that has once entered the cavity of the bladder, from being forced to return again into the ureters by an inverted or retrograde motion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="486" TYPE="part">

<P>In an adult subject, the urinary bladder is in general sufficiently capacious to contain about two pounds of urine; its <HI>fundus</HI> or bottom, which in the faetal state terminates in the <HI>urachus,</HI> and also
<PB N="106" REF="028310_0258_0FDAB535EE342FA0"/>
its posterior side, are invested by the peritoneum; as to its remaining membranes or coats, they bear a general resemblance to those of the stomach, of which we have already spoken.</P>
<P>The <HI>muscular</HI> coat consists indeed of interrupted bands of fleshy fibres, that surround the cyst, forming at the same time various irregular decus∣sations or intersections, which are different in dif∣ferent subjects: this muscular coat physiologists denominated <HI>detrusor urinae,</HI> while they designate by the name of <HI>sphincter vesicae,</HI> those orbicular fibres that partially surround the neck of the blad∣der, though they are very inconstant and irregu∣lar, both with respect to their figure and origin.</P>
<P>The <HI>nervous coat</HI> bestows on this membranous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us also the principal part of its strength and firmness.</P>
<P>Finally, the <HI>internal</HI> coat, which is considered by physiologists as a process or continuation of the epidermis, is defended by a complete covering of mucus, especially round the neck of the bladder.</P>

<P>Besides those public and well known routes of the urine, of which we have already spoken, it appears probable from several phenomena, that
<PB N="107" REF="028310_0259_0FDAB538148B9CF0"/>
there exist also certain secret avenues, which lead immediately from the intestines to the uropoietic organs. For the speedy discharge of certain drinks from the urinary emunctory, so frequently imbued with the odour, tinctured with the colour, and characterized by other specific qualities of the aliments recently taken in, will scarcely admit the belief, that these liquids had performed, in so short a time, the customary long and circuitous route through the thoracic duct and sanguiferous sys∣tem: to the foregoing circumstance we may add an account we have read, of the urine having been found covered with <HI>oil,</HI> that entered into the composition of an enema, which had been previ∣ously and recently thrown into the intestinum rec∣tum. It is, on the other hand, a circumstance well known to physiologists of the present day, that very striking and numerous anastomoses oc∣cur between the lymphatic vessels of the intes∣tines, and those of the kidneys. Lastly, it is now unequivocally ascertained and confirmed by live dissections, that if both ureters of a dog be tightly enclosed in ligatures, and his <HI>bladder</HI> perfectly evacuated of its contents, this latter organ will, notwithstanding, in the term of three hours after∣wards, contain a certain quantity of urine; while at the same time the usual avenues of this fluid, namely, the ureters, are completely obstructed, as is evident from this circumstance, that above the

ligatures these tubes suffer vast distention from the accumulated urine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="488" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 488.</HEAD>
<P>But through whatever avenues the urine has been conveyed to the bladder, its gradual accu∣mulation in that organ excites an uneasy sensation, which becoming urgent and troublesome (§ 381.) potently solicits its final elimination, through an emissary or sewer destined for that particular pur∣pose, namely, the <HI>urethra.</HI> This excretory canal is subjected to a variety in its conformation, found∣ed on the diversity of the sexes, of which we will speak more amply when treating professedly of the sexual functions.</P>

<P>In order to evacuate the bladder, it is necessary to overcome the contraction of its sphincter, by the exertion of its own <HI>detrusor</HI> (of which we for∣merly spoke) (§ 486.), aided by the co-operation of the abdominal muscles, and those subservient to the process of respiration; to which, in males of the human species, we may add, lastly, the action of the <HI>musculi acceleratores,</HI> which forcibly ejaculate, <HI>per saltum,</HI> as it were, even the residuary drops of urine that may be occasionally lodged in the bulb of the urethra.</P>

<P>As to the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>urine</HI> itself, it is subject indeed, to an infinitude of varieties generated by the circumstances of age, and season, but, above all, by the longer or shorter term of time, subse∣quent to the previous use of food and drink, the discharge of this fluid occurs; to which may be also added, the quality of the aliment previously used, &amp;c. In general, however, when we exa∣mine the urine which is discharged by a healthy human adult, immediately after sound and tran∣quil sleep, we discover it to be a watery liquid, of a nidorous smell, and citron colour, containing in its aqueous medium, (as in a common vehicle) various elementary substances, especially <HI>earthy</HI> and <HI>saline,</HI> which bear different proportions to each other in different individuals, and even in the same individual at different times and under the influence of different circumstances. Of the terrene elements the most abundant is, in general, calcareous earth, which is not unfrequently found in the urinary passages under the form of <HI>calculi,</HI> but which is, notwithstanding, extremely variable and inconstant in its quantity. Of all the saline matters, that most worthy of being mentioned, is the <HI>essential</HI> and <HI>native salt</HI> of urine—called also, <HI>microcosmic salt, fusible salt,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>To speak, then, in general terms, each sex possesses and exhibits its <HI>own</HI> peculiar <HI>habit,</HI> which differs considerably from <HI>that</HI> of the other. In
<PB N="111" REF="028310_0263_0FDAB541E44051B8"/>
the human subject after birth, this difference of habit is distinctly observable; but during the ten∣der foetal state, is scarcely to be distinguished, unless by more close and pointed attention; neither indeed, in this state, can the external organs of generation themselves be discriminated, on a transient and superficial view, owing to the extraordinary magnitude and prominency of the female clitoris, and the very diminutive size of the male scrotum.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="493" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 493.</HEAD>
<P>During the period of infancy this difference of the general habit, depending on the diversity of sex, makes only a slight impression on the ob∣server; but becomes gradually more and more obvious and striking till the full completion of the years of <HI>puberty,</HI> at which period, the general conformation of the female body, its tenderness, its softness, and the usual inferiority of its stature, contrasted with the athletic and robust body of the male, exhibit this general <HI>habitual</HI> difference in the most striking point of view.</P>

themselves. These solid portions (all other cir∣cumstances being alike) are evidently much more smooth and round in females than in males; the cylindrical bones, in particular, are more slender and delicate, and the plane ones more attenuated or thin, in the former, than in the latter sex; not to mention the peculiar diversities of certain re∣markable bones, particularly those of the thorax and pelvis, with the clavicles, the femora, &amp;c.</P>

<P>With respect to the soft parts of the body, we may observe in general, that in females, the cel∣lular membrane is more lax, more pliable, and consequently more readily dilatable in the state of pregnancy: while the skin is more tender, fair and beautiful, in consequence of the immediate substratum of fat.</P>
<P>The hair of the head is generally of a greater length in <HI>females</HI> than in <HI>males,</HI> while at the same time, certain other parts of the body which in the latter are rough and hairy, are in the former either perfectly smooth, as the chin and breast; less hairy, as the perineum; or planted with only a very tender and soft down, as the arms and legs.</P>

<P>The testes are not, from the time of their earliest formation, suspended in the scrotum, as represented in the above description: thus in the male foetus, while yet in a very tender and imma∣ture state, those glandular bodies occupy indeed a very different situation, the reason and successive changes of which were first accurately investigated and detailed by Haller, at Gottengen in the year 1749, but were afterwards explained by other writers on principles so different from each other, as to have given rise to various controversies of some weight and importance. Of the situation and changes of the testes in the foetal state, I am prepared to lay before the reader a brief, though

<P>On opening the lower abdominal region of an immature foetus, we discover in each groin, near what is called the ring of the oblique muscles, a very narrow orifice in the membrane denominated peritoneum; this orifice is the threshold to a strait avenue or alley, as it were, that leads through the abdominal ring itself, and terminates afterwards in a peculiar bullous or bubble like sack: this sack extends without the abdominal cavity, looks towards the scrotum, is interwoven with cellular fibres, and destined for the future reception of the testis.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="503" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 503.</HEAD>
<P>At the very posterior margin of this small abdominal orifice, the peritoneum sends off an∣other process, which mounts upwards, and in the tender foetus represents, in the greater part of its course, a longitudinal fold: from the basis of this process a slender cylinder, or rather inverted cone ascends, and forms at its summit, which regards
<PB N="117" REF="028310_0269_0FDAB55264C183F0"/>
the inferior margin of the kidney, a small blister or sack-like termination; in this sack the testis and epididymis are enclosed; so as to resemble, at first sight, a small berry resting on its footstalk, and appear, at the same time, to hang loosely into the abdominal cavity somewhat like the liver or spleen (§ 404).</P>

<P>The vessels which are afterwards to constitute the spermatic cord, are, at this very early period, seen running behind the extremely tender and pellucid peritoneum, so that the spermatic artery and vein run in a descending direction along the sides of the spine, while the <HI>vas deferens</HI> bending somewhat inwardly towards the neck of the uri∣nary bladder, stretches along the loose cellular membrane, which is situated behind the perito∣neum, and both enter the body of the testis in that peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oneal <HI>plica</HI> or fold of which we have already spoken.</P>

<P>From about the middle stage of pregnancy, the testes begin to sink downward by degrees, so as gradually to approach the narrow orifice of the peritoneum, which has been already mentioned. At the same time, the foregoing peritoneal fold, with its cylindrical attachment, are wrapped up
<PB N="118" REF="028310_0270_0FDAB55610660F20"/>
by degrees, till the testis finally rests on the very mouth of the preceding canal.</P>

<P>When in the foetus, now advanced to a higher stage of maturity, the testis is fully prepared for a final descent, the orifice, hitherto so contracted or narrow, suffers such a remarkable dilatation, that the testis is at full liberty to enter with facility the opening that leads out of the abdomen as well as the ring by which this opening is surrounded, to pass onward through the whole length of the canal, and thus plunge headlong, as it were, into the blister-like sac of which we have already spo∣ken. The testis having finally accomplished its descent, the peritoneal opening is soon after closed in the most complete manner, and even subjected in a short time to a perfect adhesion of its sides, so that in the stage of <HI>infancy,</HI> scarcely a wreck of it is left, to point the enquirer to the place of its former existence.</P>

<P>The more gradual and slow the movement of the testis (while yet in the abdominal cavity) to∣wards the orifice of its egression, the more sud∣den and instantaneous appears to be its act of transition through the abdominal ring. For in the dissections of mature foetuses, it is by no means
<PB N="119" REF="028310_0271_0FDAB556E4C54CB0"/>
uncommon to discover the testis either as yet in∣cumbent on the peritoneal opening, or else statio∣nary in the groin, after having recently passed the abdominal ring: but once only was I so fortunate as to have an opportunity of observing the right testicle of a twin-foetus (of which a complete drawing has been given), at the very moment of its passage through the abdominal ring: the gland appeared to have been very tightly embraced and strangled, as it were, by the surrounding parts, and was apparently in complete readiness to emerge from the abdomen into its destined sack; a transition already accomplished by the left tes∣ticle, that had just escaped from the ring, the ori∣fice of which had again resumed its former imper∣vious state.</P>

For the testicle, after its entire escape from the abdomen, has still a further stage of its journey to perform, namely, its final descent along the groin into the

<P>That the foregoing is indeed a true account of the progressive movement of the testes in their descent from the abdomen into the scrotum, I have had sufficient opportunities of ascertaining from repeated observation. To develope the <HI>causes</HI> and <HI>energies</HI> by which this astonishing de∣scent is accomplished, appears to be indeed attend∣ed with difficulties of the utmost magnitude. For I am daily more and more convinced, that neither of those powers to which this descent has been hither∣to ascribed (such, for example, as the action of the cremaster muscle, the action of the diaphragm, or the contractility alone of that cellular and tendi∣nous intertexture, which adheres to the processes of the peritoneum, and is usually denominated <HI>gubernaculum</HI> Hunterii, &amp;c.), is sufficient to ex∣plain a movement of such extreme singularity, especially that part of it relating to the immediate transition of the testis through the narrow abdo∣minal ring, to which the reader's attention has been so frequently solicited: while I am impressed, on the other hand, by a thorough conviction, that this whole process exhibits the most unequi∣vocal and striking example of what we have de∣nominated <HI>specific life,</HI> without the peculiar opera∣tion

<P>The involucra by which the testes are invested, after their final completion of the foregoing route, may be aptly enough divided into <HI>common</HI> and <HI>proper.</HI></P>
<P>The only involucrum common to both these glandular bodies is the <HI>scrotum.</HI> This is a sac, consisting of a tender portion of cutis expanded over a thin substratum of fat, and possessing a pe∣culiarity that does not reside in any other part of the common integuments of the body, namely, a power of changing, in a very remarkable degree, its usual habit and appearance: thus, it sometimes depends loose and flaccid, and again (especially under the impression of the venereal oestrum, or in case of exposure to cold), becomes constricted and rigid, as it were, and is then particularly marked by furrows and diversified rugosities.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="511" TYPE="part">

<P>Of those involucra which are proper to each testis, that placed immediately beneath and within
<PB N="122" REF="028310_0274_0FDAB5663510A3F8"/>
the scrotum, is called the <HI>tunica dartos:</HI> this coat possesses a very peculiar and vivid <HI>contractility,</HI> by which Winslow, Haller, and other celebrated cha∣racters have been so far deceived, as to bestow on it the nature and energy of a muscle.</P>

<P>This is succeeded (after a voluminous and soft stratum of cellular membrane), by three separate <HI>vaginal coverings,</HI> which were first accurately traced and distinguished by the ingenious and in∣defatigable Neubauer.</P>
<P>Of these vaginal coats, the exterior is <HI>common</HI> to the testicle and spermatic cord, and has the cre∣master muscle attached to it by separate bundles of fibres.</P>
<P>But the two interior are <HI>proper,</HI> one to the sper∣matic cord, and the other to the testis itself; of these the latter adheres, for the most part, by its fundus to the common tunic, while its internal surface is moistened by a lubricant fluid, some∣what after the manner of the pericardium.</P>

<P>The <HI>origin</HI> of those vaginal tunics which has given rise to such a variety of controversies among physiologists, can, (if I be not greatly deceived),
<PB N="123" REF="028310_0275_0FDAB56775096098"/>
be without difficulty ascertained, from what has been already said, when treating of the descent of the testes.</P>
<P>Thus, the <HI>tunica communis,</HI> for example, origi∣nates from the descending (§ 502.) blister-like sac or process of the peritoneum.</P>
<P>The <HI>propria testis,</HI> from that production of the peritoneum, which mounting upward in the form of a cylinder (§ 503.), invests the testis itself from its earliest formation.</P>
<P>And, finally, the <HI>propria funiculi,</HI> from that fold of the peritoneum, of which we have already spoken, and the short cylinder in which it termi∣nates previously to its embracing the testis itself.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="514" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 514.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately to the testis itself the <HI>tunica albu∣ginea</HI> is very closely attached, somewhat after the manner of a cortical covering. From this tunic, blood-vessels pass into the <HI>pulp</HI> or body of the testicle, which consists indeed entirely of innume∣rable vessels, about a span in length, wound up into small conglomerate lobules: these vessels, of which the substance of the testicle is composed, are both sanguiferous and secreting, the latter of

On the other hand, I am daily more and more per∣suaded, that the uterus, possessing no muscular fibres, is destitute also of true irritability (§ 307),

of plethora, such as congestion and anxiety about the breast, sense of tension and weight in the lum∣bar region, lassitude or weariness of the limbs, &amp;c. On the first appearance of the catamenia, the ge∣nital organs, in the beginning of the attack, usu∣ally discharge a humour of a pale reddish cast; this is gradually succeeded by a liquid of a more intensely florid and sanguineous colour, which terminates, at length, in an effusion of genuine cruor or red blood.

<P>BETWEEN the female <HI>mammae</HI> and uterus (the former of which were, by the philo∣sopher Favorinus in his communications to Gellius, elegantly and emphatically denominated, <HI>the sa∣cred fountains that nourish the human race,</HI> there exists such an extremely potent sympathetic con¦nection, that these two organs may be said to be indissolubly associated, or to accompany each other hand in hand, in their phenomena and functions. Thus, during the tender period of infancy, so great is their imbecility and want of action, that they are capable of performing scarcely any func∣tion at all: as the years of puberty advance, they begin, at the same time, to acquire vigour and activity, so that on the first eruption of the catamenia, a swelling of the mammae or breasts becomes also evident to the senses. Throughout the subsequent periods of life those two organs are either subjected to simultaneous and similar changes, as when the breasts become turgid and discharge milk during the progress of pregnancy; or experience alternate and opposite affections,
<PB N="147" REF="028310_0299_0FDAB5CFB6A6B130"/>
instances of which we have in the suspension of the catamenia during the term of lactation, a more copious effusion of the <HI>lochia</HI> when the secretion of milk does not commence at the usual period, &amp;c. And, lastly, on the unwelcome accession of old age, both the preceding functions fail at the same time, so that when the catamenia finally retreat, never again to return, the uterus and mammae become <HI>equally</HI> flaccid, inert and wholly incapable of their former action. A great variety of pathological phenomena, easily observable in cases of irregular menstruation, in <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uor albus,</HI> and other similar affections, shall be in silence preter∣mitted, although they furnish the most potent and unequivocal testimony in confirmation of the sympathy now under consideration, namely, that which exists between the uterus and mammae.</P>

<P>Nor will this intimate sympathetic connection, which subsists between the uterus and mammae, appear in any measure extraordinary or surprising, when we consider, that all those diversified <HI>sources</HI> of physiological consent, particularly enumerated on a former occasion (§ 54), jointly co-operate in the establishment of such connection between these organs of the female thorax and abdomen.</P>

Al∣though physiologists have hitherto attributed by far too much to this remarkable anastomosis, yet that it ought not to be entirely excepted from the number of co-operating causes will appear ex∣tremely probable to any one who considers the obvious and wide difference which exists between the diameter of the epigastric artery in a state of pregnancy, and that of the same vessel during the period of lactation.</P>

<P>The fine filiform radicles uniting successively in their onward passage, terminate finally in lead∣ing trunks, corresponding in number to the prin∣cipal lobes; so that they generally amount, in each mamma, to about fifteen or perhaps a few more.

<P>The analogy which is observed to exist between chyle and blood, and between each of these liquids and milk itself, renders it sufficiently pro∣bable, that this last humour, (which constitutes at present the more immediate object of our con∣sideration), is a species of chyle renovated from the volume of <HI>blood,</HI> or rather separated from this crimson fluid (with which it had just formed a junction) previously to its final and complete assi∣milation. This opinion, besides other arguments
<PB N="152" REF="028310_0304_0FDAB5E32C0BF870"/>

<P>The reason why, during the progressive con∣tinuance of lactation, this bland food of the foetus becomes gradually more and more inspis∣sated, rich and oily, must be referred chiefly to the lymphatic veins, with which the mammae plentifully abound: Thus the more profuse the afflux of <HI>milk,</HI> and the greater length of time this afflux has continued, with the more power and uniformity do these lymphatics absorb its serous parts, and convey them back to the mass of cir∣culating blood, by which means they furnish the most effective aid to the whole process of this se∣cretion (§ 476).</P>

<P>This <HI>liquid</HI> being discharged from the ovary, the external lips of the small and recent wound through which it was emitted, are again united by a fine cicatrix, while the remaining delicate vascular membrane in which the liquid had been enclosed, constitutes what is called <HI>corpus luteum.</HI> This body appears to be at first hollow and filled with a quantity of plastic lymph, that in process of time is converted into a fleshy nucleus, invested by a firm cortex or membrane, which is inter∣spersed by a variety of minute, yet remarkable blood-vessels.</P>

<P>This ovulum, or little egg, is composed of two proper membranes, besides that external <HI>adven∣titious</HI> covering, which it derives from the <HI>caduca</HI> of Hunter.</P>
<P>The proper membranes are, <HI>first,</HI> an external one, apparently destitute of blood-vessels, which forms the <HI>chorion</HI> of modern writers. From the earliest origin of this membrane a great part of its external superficies is beautifully set with knot-like flocculi or minute <HI>piles</HI> of inconceivable elegance, from whence it has been called, <HI>chorion muscosum seu frondosum,</HI> i. e. the <HI>moss-like,</HI> or <HI>leaf-like, chorion.</HI> By means of those delicate piles, which constitute the rudiments of the foetal part of the future placenta, the ovulum is inserted (as if by roots) into the <HI>decidua uterina.</HI> (§ 569.)</P>
<P>The other membrane, lying interiorly, is deno∣minated the <HI>amnion,</HI> which is also destitute of blood-vessels, (§ 5.) it is indeed delicate and ten∣der, but yet of remarkable tenacity and strength.</P>

<DIV3 N="573" TYPE="part">

<P>For a few weeks after the first formation of the <HI>ovulum,</HI> its two proper membranes differ very widely from each other in point of size, the chorion exhibiting the appearance of a <HI>larger</HI>

bladder, to the inside of which the amnion adheres under the form of a <HI>smaller</HI> one, and is attached in particular to that part which is opposite to the centre of the external floccose superficies of the chorion.</P>
<P>The interstice which then exists between the <HI>chorion</HI> and <HI>amnion</HI> is filled with a very subtle chrystaline water, of doubtful origin, and transient continuance.</P>
<P>For when the <HI>amnion</HI> begins, during the first months after conception, to increase with greater rapidity than the chorion, and to gain on the latter membrane in point of magnitude, this chrys∣taline liquor must necessarily undergo a synchro∣nous, and perfectly correspondent, diminution.</P>

<P>The internal membrane of the ovum, from the earliest period of its formation (§. 570), till the final close of parturition itself, is constantly filled with a fluid, denominated by physiologists, <HI>liquor amnii.</HI> This liquid is aqueous, and of a pale yellowish colour; it emits scarcely any odour, and is to the taste <HI>bland,</HI> with a slight saline impreg∣nation hardly perceptible; physiologists generally suppose it to be a source of nourishment, and compare it to the white of an egg, from which it
<PB N="160" REF="028310_0312_0FDAB5FBE968C0F8"/>
notwithstanding, differs in a very obvious and essential manner, as may be easily demonstrated by an attentive experimental investigation.</P>
<P>The sources of this fluid are as yet doubtful: It is certainly, however, neither deriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from the foetus nor the umbilical cord, as it is not unfre∣quently found in abortive ovula, which contain neither of these bodies.</P>
<P>The quantity of this fluid is in an inverse pro∣portion to the bulk of the foetus. Thus the smaller and more tender the embryo, the more profuse is the volume of <HI>liquor amnii,</HI> and vice versa.</P>
<P>Hence we are at liberty to hazard a conjecture respecting the primary use of this liquor, which appears to be subservient, not so much to the nutrition, as to the protection and defence of the minute body of the tender embryo, as yet in a gelatinous state, and, therefore, wholly unable to bear the violence of external injuries. With respect to that small portion of the <HI>liquor amnii,</HI> which has been sometimes (though so rarely as to deserve to be esteemed a preternatural occurrence) found in the stomach of the foetus, it cannot possibly be destined for the purpose of its <HI>nutrition,</HI> as will be obvious to any one who considers how

extremely inert and empty the chyliferous system of even a more mature foetus appears, how unfit for, and even how averse from, the arduous and important process of chylification.

These vessels are se∣parated and distinguished from each other by cel∣lular partitions, running in various directions, and have their <HI>lights</HI> or diameters frequently straitened by the small nodes or valve-like bodies of Ho∣boken.</P>
<P>These vessels are collected and compacted to∣gether into a cord by means of cellular membrane, which being filled with a singular and very limpid humour, exhibits the appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance of jelly, but is in∣vested externally by a continuation of the amnion.</P>

<P>At the place where the <HI>foetus</HI> is attached to this <HI>cord,</HI> the latter is joined by a peculiar body, which originates from the bottom of the <HI>vesica urinaria</HI> (§ 486.), and pursues a middle course between the two umbilical arteries, namely, the <HI>urachus.</HI> This body is, in the human species, pervious, for at least a short space, and afterwards totally disappears; but in other animals belong∣ing to the class mammalia, leads onward to what is called the <HI>allantois.</HI> Of this allantois the human foetus appears to be entirely destitute, unless we be inclined to designate by this name that myste∣rious and transient <HI>vesicu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a umbilicalis,</HI> uniformly observable in the human ovula, between the cho∣rion and amnion, which (if I be not greatly de∣ceived) Isbr. de Diemerbroek first discovered long before it was seen by Albinus or Zinn. But in more modern times it is discovered too frequently, and with too uniform an aspect in unvitiated and fruitful human ovula, (even to so late a period as the third month after conception), to be any longer considered as an accidental, a morbid, or a monstrous conformation of the part.</P>

<P>The blood-vessels of the cord, of which we have already spoken, pass into the <HI>placenta,</HI> which was formerly said to originate from the leaf-like
<PB N="164" REF="028310_0316_0FDAB607E56A9918"/>
superficies of the chorion, a membrane attached to, and even inserted in, the <HI>decidua crassa:</HI> Hence we perceive that the placenta is a body composed of two different kinds of substance, re∣ceived from an equal number of sources. Thus, for example, one kind called the <HI>uterine,</HI> from its immediate apposition to that organ, is derived from the decidua, and constitutes the spongy pa∣renchymatous portion of the placenta; while the other belonging to the foetus, and therefore call∣ed the <HI>foe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al</HI> part, is derived from the umbilical vessels distributed throughout the chorion.</P>
<P>At this time the increase of the tender ovum is unequal, so that the growth of the smooth por∣tion of the chorion is greater and more rapid than that of the <HI>muscosum</HI> or moss-like; hence it is evident, that the relative magnitude of the placenta to that of the whole volume of the egg, is greater in proportion as the conception is more recent, and less, on the other hand, accordingly as the period of parturition is nearer.</P>
<P>As pregnancy gradually advances, the placenta becomes more and more close and compact in its texture; it is impressed with grooves, and distin∣guished into lobes on its <HI>external</HI> surface which respects the uterus, but is smooth and highly po∣lished on its <HI>internal,</HI> which, looking towards the
<PB N="165" REF="028310_0317_0FDAB60C376939F8"/>
foetus, is invested or lined by the amnios. With regard to magnitude, thickness, figure, and situa∣tion or point of <HI>cohesion</HI> to the uterus, it is sub∣ject to a multitude of diversities; it is attached, however, for the most part, to the fundus or bot∣tom of that organ; and is, upon the whole, equally destitute of both sensibility (§ 205.) and genuine irritability (§ 307).</P>

From an attentive and impartial conside∣ration of all the testimony that can be collected on this subject, the result appears to be, that there exists no direct anastomosis between the blood-vessels of the maternal uterus and those of the umbilical cord; but the arterial blood which passes by a continuous route from the uterus of the mother to that portion of the placenta that owes its origin to the decidua crassa, is there absorbed by the inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ient radicles of the umbilical veins, that are distributed throughout the moss-like por∣tion of the chorion, and thus conducted into the

<P>The foregoing opinions receive additional con∣firmation from the many well guarded but fruit∣less attempts that have been made by different physiologists to inject the vessels of the umbilical cord through those of the uterus, or, on the other hand, to fill the <HI>vessels</HI> of the latter organ by in∣jections forced through <HI>those</HI> of the former. As a further evidence in support of the same prin∣ciples, we may mention the difference which is observed to exist between the pulse of the mother and that of the foetus before their final disen∣gagement from each other; and lastly, it may not be improper to add, as a circumstance tend∣ing to the establishment of the same result, the observations which we formerly delivered respect∣ing the difference between the nature of the foetal and that of the maternal blood (§ 147).</P>
<P>But further, it appears probable that a portion of chyle is also conveyed to the foetus along with the blood of the mother. For besides the conside∣ration,
<PB N="167" REF="028310_0319_0FDAB613B20BDFD8"/>
that the blood of the mother is not at all times equally pure and unmixed, but, for some hours after every meal, carries along with it, in an unassimilated state, that portion of chyle re∣cently received from the thoracic duct, it has been demonstrated, on a former occasion, that the uterus itself possesses a singular and strong affinity to the chyle and milk (§ 550.553.); and there are also on record a great variety of observations, from which it appears, that a milky juice has been actually discovered in the uterine portion of the placenta.</P>

<P>During the progressive advancement of preg∣nancy, while the foetus and secundines increase so very remarkably in magnitude, it is obvious that the uterus must be also subjected to striking and remarkable changes. Besides the augmentation of its bulk, so extremely evident at first view, those changes respect also its <HI>situation</HI> and <HI>figure,</HI> but affect more especially the <HI>texture</HI> of this sin∣gular and important viscus. Thus, in consequence of the uniform and weighty congestion of humours which the gravid uterus is obliged to sustain, it is likewise subjected to extreme alteration, both with regard to the state of its blood vessels, and
<PB N="168" REF="028310_0320_0FDAB614AB7E3760"/>
also with respect to that of its parenchymatous portion, throughout which those vessels are inter∣woven.</P>
<P>On the present occasion it may not be impro∣per to observe, that in proportion as the impreg∣nated uterus advances in magnitude, its blood-vessels lose that mazy and convoluted appearance, for which they are at other times so very remark∣able, and assume courses much more rectilineal or direct; while at the same time they are subjected to a considerable extension of their diameters, and a consequent increase of their real capacities. Thus, even the uterine veins have become so ex∣tremely capacious and prominent, as to have been mistaken by numerous anatomists for true sinuses.</P>
<P>With regard to the parenchymatous portion of the impregnated uterus, it becomes gradually more and more lax and spongy, especially where it is in contact with the ovum contained; so that towards its fundus or bottom it becomes consider∣ably thick, and in a living and healthy female, is greatly distended with blood, and possesses the powers of life in a very high degree. This or∣gan is, notwithstanding, soft at the same time, and very widely di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erent in its general habit and appearance from the firm and compact flesh of the
<PB N="169" REF="028310_0321_0FDAB61625DF30C0"/>
uterus in an unimpregnated state: this difference is still more striking if the subject containing the gravid <HI>uterus</HI> be dead, in which case, provided pregnancy be considerably advanced, this organ falsely assumes in its texture (as was formerly well observed by Arantius), a lamellated appearance.</P>
<P>It may not be amiss, on the present occasion, briefly to enumerate a few more of the most important changes to which the gravid uterus is subjected, together with the most remarkable ones that occur in the ovum and foetus. These changes we will consider in the successive order in which they appear throughout the series of <HI>ten lunar</HI> months, which period of time is now, with suffi∣cient propriety, supposed to constitute the most natural term of pregnancy.</P>

<P>As we uniformly observe the uterus beginning to swell shortly after the time of impregnation, (§ 567.) so being from that period increased both in bulk and weight, it descends a little deeper into the superior part of the vagina; notwithstanding this descent it still retains its former figure in all, except the following, respects, viz. its fundus becomes a little more convex, its <HI>anterior paries</HI> or wall, recedes a little farther from the <HI>posterior,</HI> and its cavity, which was before very narrow and
<PB N="170" REF="028310_0322_0FDAB619D5C034F0"/>
almost triangular, now accommodates itself to the globose figure of the ovulum it encloses.</P>
<P>About the end of the first month, the ovulum itself amounts to the size of a pigeon's egg, and has the two deciduae separated from each other, and also the small amnion situated at a distance from the larger chorion: about the termination of the third month it attains the size of a goose's egg, the caduca re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lexa becomes approximated to the crassa, and the amnion approaches nearer to the chorion. The amnion abounds, at this time, with a profuse volume of fluid denominated <HI>liquor amnii.</HI> In this liquor the embryo, as yet very tender, and extremely small in proportion to the quantity of the surrounding fluid (being at this time scarcely equal in magnitude to a small mouse) appears to fluctuate in a loose and unsteady manner, and is even now in a precipitate position.</P>

<DIV3 N="584" TYPE="part">

<P>About the fourth month after conception, the uterus begins to assume more of an oval or some∣what globe-like appearance; its neck being more and more softened, gradually shortened, and as it were, destroyed, or rather latterly distended, it again protrudes upwards, and begins to ascend from the smaller into the larger pelvis. At the same time the fallopian tubes themselves, with the
<PB N="171" REF="028310_0323_0FDAB61AAA827DF8"/>
convex bottom of the uterus being elevated or borne upwards, are thus extended and elongated; these tubes are, however, attached and connected so closely to the sides of the uterus, that they cannot recede from them, more than one half of their own length; hence, when only viewed superficially, they appear to originate and proceed from the middle of the uterus, which has given birth to a very erroneous opinion respecting the astonishing increase of the <HI>fundus uteri.</HI></P>
<P>From this time also the foetus acquires by degrees such an increased magnitude, as renders it more proportionate to the capacity of the ovum, and begins about the same period to fix itself in a more steady and firm position, which it preserves till the very close of parturition: in this position its head is placed in a downward direction, and and its face turned towards the lumbar region of the mother, inclining, for the most part, somewhat obliquely towards the left side.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="585" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 585.</HEAD>
<P>In the middle stage of pregnancy, which occurs about the end of the fifth month, the uterus has attained such a magnitude, that its fundus is elevated to a point half-way between the <HI>pubes</HI> and <HI>umbilicus,</HI> and the pregnant state becomes now
<PB N="172" REF="028310_0324_0FDAB61C2B287640"/>
observable from the external appearance of the abdomen.</P>
<P>About the same time, the foetus becomes more perceptible to the mother from the agitative mo∣tion of its body, though we are not able to deter∣mine, with accuracy and definitude the precise period of time at which this motion takes place. It appears now, however, to be more vigorous and active, so that, according to the common use and acceptation of speech, it may be said to be the unequivocal action of life.</P>

<P>Throughout the five remaining lunar months the uterus, with the foetus which it contains, make gradually still farther advancements in point of magnitude. Thus, at the end of the sixth month they reach nearly to the umbilicus or navel; and about the termination of the eighth approach even the scrobiculus cordi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in consequence of farther protrusion upwards. The <HI>cervix uteri</HI> is in the mean time more and more obliterated, re∣duced nearer to a level with the adjacent parts of that organ, and its parietes or walls considerably diminish in thickness.</P>

<P>Finally, about the end of the tenth month after conception, the uterus being oppressed and over-powered as it were, by its own bulk and weight, (its longitudinal axis, amounting in general to 11, and its transverse to 9 inches in length) begins again to subside, and as the period of parturition approaches, its <HI>ostium</HI> or mouth is gradually ex∣panded, and thus exhibits an orbicular or ring-like opening.</P>
<P>Each membrana caduca, more especially the reflected one, which adheres to the chorion, having been gradually attenuated for several months immediately preceding, exhibits now a kind of net-like appearance distinctly marked by short fibres of a whitish colour.</P>
<P>Such is the size of the placenta at this advanced period, that its greatest diameter or breadth amounts to about 9 inches, its least diameter or thickness to about one inch; and its weight to about one pound, and sometimes more.</P>
<P>The length of the umbilical cord for the most part equals, and sometimes even exceeds, eighteen inches.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="028310_0326_0FDAB6222CC1BF98"/>The weight of a mature and well grown foetus is nearly seven pounds, its length about twenty inches.</P>

<P>There are not wanting certain characters of high celebrity and distinction who attempt, even in our own times, to explain the divine process, in the following brief and summary manner; they contend that the genuine work of <HI>actual generation</HI> has not, at the present time, any real existence at all; on the contrary, they allege, that the whole human race possessed, under the form of original germs, a joint pre-exstence in the genital system of one or other of our first parents, and that these germs have ever been, and are yet, subjected to gradual <HI>evolutions,</HI> according as the progressive lapse of time, aided by the co-operation of specific causes, has contributed to awaken them to the enjoyment of open and actual life.</P>

<P>To me it appears, indeed, highly probable, that a stated period of time is requisite for accomplish∣ing the intimate mixture, the union and complete concoction or maturity of those various inquiline humours, belonging to each sex, (§ 518. 524. 542. 543.) which are doubtless discharged into the cavity of the uterus, during every act of fruitful coition. This term of preparation having at length elapsed, and the liquors being fully matured and brought into the most perfect state of union and reciprocal influence, the nisus formativus is forth∣with excited into action, by means of which the
<PB N="178" REF="028310_0330_0FDAB62FD0DE5FE8"/>
spermatic mass, hitherto formless and chaotic, is partly arranged and organized into the elegant and beautiful envelopes of the nascent <HI>ovulum,</HI> and partly moulded into the figure of the living embryo which this minute bodies encloses. From this theory we can assign a satisfactory reason, why the uterus, for the two first weeks after con∣ception, appears to contain a mass of crude and shapeless humours alone, and does not exhibit, even to our best glasses (now brought to very high perfection), the smallest vestige of an or∣ganized embryo, which, notwithstanding bursts into view almost instantaneously about the end of the third week, and is, even on its first appear∣ance, of considerable magnitude.</P>
</DIV3>

<P>Of the <HI>nisus formativus</HI> we are presented with more remote vestiges throughout every department of natural bodies, not excluding even the most simple elements of matter, where original germs cannot possibly be supposed to have the shadow of an existence. Thus, the clouds themselves assume their own determinate forms, and even the stream∣ing torrents or veins of the electric fluid preserve specific figures. There are, again, in the mineral kingdom, specimens of metallic chrystallization, which, if indeed the form alone be considered, and

<P>In testimony of the truth of this, we need only mention the curious hypniform crystals into which refined or depurated copper shoots when first reduced to a state of fusion, or that exquisitely beautiful specimen of native peruvian silver which they call <HI>filicinum</HI> or <HI>fern-like,</HI> from the resem∣blance of its figure to that of the plant denomi∣nated fern.</P>

The result of attentive and minute observations made on this process in such subjects as these, will be sufficient to evince, on the autho∣rity of the most indubitable testimony that, at least in these bodies, no germs pre-exist. In illustration of the above position it will be sufficient to mention

<P>The first argument I shall further propose on this subject is taken from the history of those curious and interesting subjects of organized nature denominated <HI>hybrids.</HI> From a very beautiful and celebrated experiment it appears, that, if prolific female hybrids be successively through several generations impregnated by males of any given species different from the species of the females, the new offspring will gradually deviate so widely from the original form of the mother, and make such evident and effectual strides towards that of the father, as to lose at length every vestige of similitude to the former, and become finally, (by a

<P>There exists a phenomenon or fact relative to the history and production of <HI>monsters,</HI> (the truth of which is too well ascertained and established to admit of a doubt), that merits our attention while on the consideration of the present interest∣ing and intricate subject.

<DIV3 N="599" TYPE="part">

<P>The phenomena of <HI>re-production</HI> in general are much more easily and rationally accounted for, by considering them as the result of a nisus forma∣tivus, than by referring them to the pre-existence of partial or local germs. This observation is more fully and clearly illustrated, and its truth more forcibly exhibited by an application of it to some particular instances of re-production, as that of the nails, for example, which after the entire loss of the <HI>first,</HI> are well known to be frequently regenerated on the <HI>second</HI> phalanx of the fingers.</P>

<P>Finally, on comparing with candour, and weigh∣ing with impartiality, the various arguments on each side of the question, it very evidently ap∣pears, that besides a <HI>power of exciting</HI> to motion and action, which the advocates for the pre-ex∣istence of germs attribute to the <HI>male semen,</HI> in order to render their favourite theory more spe∣cious and plausible, they must also bestow on that fluid <HI>plastic</HI> or <HI>formative</HI> powers of the utmost extent and influence: Whence it is obvious, that the doctrine for which they so zealously contend, is of itself wholly inadequate to the explanation of the numerous and intricate phenomena of ge∣neration, unless it be aided by the powerful con∣currence of a <HI>nisus formativus:</HI> Whereas, on the other hand, the system which we have just pro∣posed on the subject is, without the bold pre∣sumption of <HI>pre-existent germs,</HI> fully sufficient to explain all the multiplicity of phenomena attend∣ant

<P>With respect to the <HI>causes</HI> of a revolution so determinate and sudden, different and even oppo∣site opinions have been entertained by different physiologists. When we view, and take into at∣tentive consideration, all the attendant circum∣stances, it appears necessary to refer the cause, which immediately impels to parturition, to an eternal law of nature, which has hitherto received no better explanation than has been given to a great many other physical phenomena, which take place in like manner at regular and <HI>stated periods;</HI> such, for example, as the metamorphosis of insects, the progressive stages of eruptive fevers, their crises, &amp;c. &amp;c. Without subjecting themselves to the just charge of fancifully entering on an absurd
<PB N="186" REF="028310_0338_0FDAB64DC06A79D0"/>
speculation, certain physiologists have compared a mature ovum, in the uterus of the human subject, to the healthy fruit of vegetables, which when completely ripened, fall spontaneously from their parent plants, in consequence of a <HI>self-constriction</HI> of the vessels through which their nourishment was conveyed. It has been in like manner ob∣served, that as the period of parturition ap∣proaches, the human placenta suffers a slight de∣gree of constriction, and becomes thus prepared, as it were, for its impending separation from the surrounding uterus.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>opinion</HI> entertained on this subject by physiologists in general, namely, that the amazing expansion to which the impregnated uterus is subjected, with a multitude of other im∣pressions or impulsive powers of a like nature, act as the genuine exciting causes of parturition, it appears to be very clearly and effectually invali∣dated by a great variety of <HI>arguments,</HI> which may be fairly deduced from the unequivocal pheno∣mena of the animal economy itself: of these argu∣ments we think proper to mention the following, namely, in numberless genuine cases of extra-uterine conception, where the foetuses have been contained, for example, in the Fallopian tubes, or in the ovaria, the uterus has notwithstanding been attacked by painful and convulsive throws, about

<HEAD>§ 615.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been already said respecting the mode of life enjoyed by the foetus, while yet encarcerated within the parietes, and immersed in the warm-bath of the maternal uterus, it is extremely obvious that an immense difference must exist, between the functions of the animal economy in this state, and that which shortly suc∣ceeds, when the infant is finally introduced, by birth, into entire life, and is possessed of a power of spontaneous motion. An enumeration and statement of the leading points or circumstances of this difference, constitutes the design of the present section.</P>

<P>To begin then with the circulation of the blood, it must be observed, that the <HI>route</HI> of this crimson fluid is different in the <HI>foetal</HI> state, from what it is in <HI>that</HI> which immediately succeeds paturition or birth. During the continuance of the former state, the <HI>foetus</HI> is connected, and preserves a cir∣cular intercourse with the uterine placenta, by means of the umbilical cord; it has never, as yet, inspired air for the purpose of supplying the blood with that vital pabulum, a process which immedi∣ately commences and is uniformly continued after birth, when this reciprocal connection between the mother and child, is finally destroyed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="617" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 617.</HEAD>
<P>The umbilical vein originating from the placenta of the mother, and passing through what is called the umbilical ring of the foetus, directs its course towards the liver, where it discharges its blood into the sinus of the vena portarum; from thence the blood is distributed in part, by the ramifica∣tions of this memorable vein, throughout the liver, and in part, conveyed by a direct route through the <HI>ductus venosus Arantii,</HI> to the <HI>inferior</HI> or ascending vena cava.</P>
<P>The two foregoing canals, namely, both that portion of the umbilical cord which is contained
<PB N="193" REF="028310_0437_0FD885B8A67D9F58"/>
in the abdomen of the foetus, and also the ductus venosus mentioned above, suffer after birth an entire obliteration of their cavities, and assume the nature and appearance of solid cords, insomuch that the former constitutes what is denominated the <HI>round ligament</HI> of the liver.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="618" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 618.</HEAD>
<P>When, in the foetus, the blood is conveyed from the inferior vena cava to the right side of the heart, the greater part of it is denied a passage from thence through the lungs, and is therefore directed towards the left or posterior auricle of the heart, by the valve of Eustachius, and admit∣ted into that cavity through the <HI>foramen ovale.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="619" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 619.</HEAD>
<P>For over the mouth of the inferior vena cava, after its ascent from the cavity of the abdomen in the foetal state, a valve of a lunated figure is extended, which, in honour of its immortal discoverer, has been called the valve of Eustachius. This luni∣form body is, for the most part, gradually oblite∣rated as life advances, although in the foetal state it appears to perform the important office of directing the blood, emerging from the abdominal cavity, towards an <HI>orifice</HI> to be spoken of presently, which penetrates the septum situated between the two auricles of the heart.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="620" TYPE="part">
<PB N="194" REF="028310_0438_0FD885BE922A2D50"/>
<HEAD>§ 620.</HEAD>
<P>The orifice referred to in the preceding para∣graph is called the <HI>foramen ovale,</HI> through which by far the greater part of the ascending column of blood, derived immediately from the inferior vena cava, is conducted into the left <HI>auris</HI> of the heart during each diastole of the auricles: of this blood the regurgitation is effectually prevented, by the elegant falciform valve formerly mentioned, which is closely spread over the foramen, and appears to close that orifice completely, during each systolic motion of the auricles. During the first years of infancy the <HI>foramen ovale</HI> is in part closed by means of this small valve, and partly obliterated by the gradual but slow adhesion of its sides: in cor∣respondence to such adhesion, the valve of Eusta∣chius itself undergoes also a slow and gradual diminution in point of size, till scarcely a wreck of it is left behind.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="621" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 621.</HEAD>
<P>Of that blood which, at the same time, enters the right auricle of the heart from the superior vena cava, a very small portion only can be received by the lungs of the foetus, as yet in a weak and in∣active condition: it is therefore taken up by the <HI>ductus arteriosus,</HI> from the trunk of the pulmonary artery (of which this duct is indeed the leading branch) and conveyed by a direct and speedy route
<PB N="195" REF="028310_0439_0FD88D514BC42D30"/>
to the arch of the aorta, without passing through the lungs at all. Within the course of a few weeks after the birth of the infant, the cavity of the ductus arteriosus is, for the most part obliterated, and its parietes or walls converted into the nature and appearance of a dense and firm ligament.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="622" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 622.</HEAD>
<P>The blood being propelled through the trunk of the aorta, that portion of it, destined to be re-conveyed to the system of the mother, enters the <HI>umbilical arteries</HI> (§ 578.) which pass through the <HI>annulus umbilicalis,</HI> on each side of the <HI>urachus,</HI> and are, in like manner, after the birth of the infant, converted into solid imperforated cords.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="623" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 623.</HEAD>
<P>As the lungs perform in the foetus scarcely any function at all, their general <HI>habit</HI> and <HI>appearance</HI> differ very materially from those which they assume after the infant has commenced the process of respiration. Thus, their bulk is proportionably much less, their colour more dark, their substance more compact, and hence their specific gravity so much greater, that when immersed, recent and free from putrefaction, into a vessel of water, they sink instantly to the bottom; whereas, on the other hand, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he infant has been born in a living state, and taken in air by inspiration, these viscera,
<PB N="196" REF="028310_0440_0FD88D52CC6A6010"/>
for the most part, float on the surface of water, or of any other fluid equally ponderous. The right lobe of the lungs appears to possess the peculiar prerogative of being dilated a little sooner than the, left by the incipient influx of air in the first act of inspiration. With regard to the other pheno∣mena of this new function of life, they were enumerated formerly, when we were treating particularly of the process of respiration.</P>

<DIV3 N="624" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 624.</HEAD>
<P>From the observations which were formerly proposed on the nutrition of the foetus (§ 574, 581.), it may be very easily perceived that the state and condition of the <HI>alimentary tube</HI> and <HI>chy∣lopoletic system,</HI> are extremely different before, from what they are after, the birth of the infant, these viscera being in the first case inert and wholly incapable of action. Thus, for instance, in the tender embryo of only a very few months existence, the <HI>larger,</HI> are perfectly similar in habit and appearance to the <HI>smaller, intestines;</HI> but during the closing months of pregnancy the <HI>former</HI> portion of the intestinal canal (being considerably distended with <HI>meconium</HI>) appears to merit unequi∣vocally that name by which it is afterwards dis∣tinguished from the <HI>latter.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>meconium</HI> is a peculiar species of saburra, of a green colour, shaded with more or less of a brownish cast. It is doubtless derived from the inquiline humours of the foetus itself, more espe∣cially from the bile: that it is indeed of a bilious origin we are induced to believe from the follow∣ing considerations:—<HI>First,</HI> because the earliest appearance of this excrementious substance corres∣ponds exactly, in point of time, with the com∣mencement of the biliary secretion; and, <HI>Secondly,</HI> because we learn from accurate observation, that such monsters as are destitute of a liver, have their intestines supplied with nothing else but a small quantity of colourless mucus instead of the more common and natural meconium.</P>

<DIV3 N="626" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 626.</HEAD>

<P>The present appears to be indeed a very fit and favourable opportunity for calling the attention of the reader to three parts of the human body, altogether peculiar in their nature and obscure in their destination, which are of a greater propor∣tional size in the foetus than in the adult, and appear to be in a special manner subservient to the economy of the former. The true and une∣quivocal uses of the parts now in contemplation have not as yet, however, been clearly and satis∣factorily ascertained, although, anxiously sought after by the combined labours of numerous and very respectable anatomists. These parts are designated by the name of glands, although their <HI>parenchyma</HI> is far, very far, different from the <HI>glandular,</HI> and they have never been discovered
<PB N="199" REF="028310_0443_0FD885BD115AEAB8"/>
to possess the faintest vestige of an excretory duct. They are denominated the <HI>thyroid gland,</HI> the <HI>thymus,</HI> and the <HI>renes succenturiatati.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="629" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 629.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>thyroid gland</HI> is situated on the anterior side of a cartilage of the same name, which enters into the conformation of the larynx. It consists of two lobes, and is of a lunated or falciform figure; in the foetus it is distended with a lympha∣tic fluid, but, as life advances, becomes gradually more and more spoliated of its distending liquid.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="630" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>§ 630.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>thymus</HI> consists of a mass of shining and very tender flesh, is, in like manner with the pre∣ceding substance, <HI>bilobular,</HI> now and then divided into two distinct portions, and contains also occa∣sionally a cavity of considerable dimensions. This body is situated beneath the middle and upper part of the sternum, and ascends on each side even to the throat itself; in the foetus it is large, irregular in its figure, and abounds with a juice of a milk-like nature; but as youth advances it gra∣dually diminishes in size, until, finally, on the accession of old age, it is so completely obliterated as to exhibit scarcely a shadow of its former existence.</P>

<P>Lastly, The <HI>Renes succenturiatali,</HI> (called like∣wise <HI>glandulae suprarenales, capsulae atrabiliariae,</HI> &amp;c.) are situated beneath the diaphragm, resting on the upper extremities of the kidneys. In adults they are not only diminished in size, but are also removed to a small distance from the contact of the kidneys, and contain a dark coloured fluid, which in the foetus is more inclined to a pale red.</P>

<P>Finally, the frigid reign of the ultimate degree of old age is strongly characterised by the follow∣ing concomitant phenomena, namely, a sluggish∣ness and increasing dulness of the <HI>senses,</HI> both ex∣ternal and internal, an irresistible call for longer indulgence in sleep, and a torpidity and languor in all the functions of the animal economy. The hairs assume a silvery gray, and fall in part from their exalted situation. The teeth themselves drop spontaneously from their declining sockets. The neck is no longer able to support the head, nor the tottering legs to sustain the weight of the incumbent body.

<P>The <HI>phenomena</HI> of this <HI>natural death</HI> (as observed in man when about to resign himself to its potent grasp), are, a coldness of the extremities, a loss of the brilliancy of the eyes, a very small and slow pulse, accompanied with intermissions pro∣gressively increasing in frequency, and lastly a slow respiration, which by a more forcible act of ex∣spiration, is at length closed for ever.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, IN WHICH IS EXHIBITED A Condensed and Summary View OF THE EXISTING DISCOVERIES AND SPECULATIONS Relative to the Subject of, what is usually denominated, ANIMAL ELECTRICITY.</HEAD>
<P>STEADY and uniform as the lapse of time itself, are the exertions made by the enter∣prize and industry of man, to shed light on the <HI>arcana</HI> or <HI>secret processes</HI> of nature. In proportion as such laudable attempts are prosecuted with boldness and crowned with success, <HI>revolutions</HI> and <HI>improvements</HI> take place in the various branches of physical science. Revolutions derive birth from the detection of error, while improvements result from the discovery of truth. On the repudiation of false principles in science, as well as on the developement of new ones deduced from the reci∣procal
<PB N="214" REF="028310_0457_0FD89B23EB2DFC50"/>
concurrence of numerous and unequivocal facts, it is not without the sanction of reason and propriety that new systems are forthwith compiled, digested and ushered into the world.</P>
<P>For, to be complete and satisfactory, a system in any branch of science, should embrace and ar∣range in order all the well authenticated principles spontaneously resulting from facts already ascer∣tained and observations already made, relative to that particular branch. A system less general and comprehensive in its scope than this, should be deemed, at best, but defective and partial, and received as the abortive production of a mind deficient in point of information.</P>
<P>Of the former description was the famous phy∣siological system of Baron Haller, at the time its illustrious author first submitted it to the eye of the world. That excellent physician and philosopher grasped in his acute and comprehensive mind, and detailed at large, in the work to which I here allude, all the authentic and well defined princi∣ples resulting from the infinitude of facts with which the science of physiology was at that time enriched.</P>
<P>But all systems are stationary and have been as yet imperfect, while, happily for the interest of
<PB N="215" REF="028310_0458_0FD89B252FC4D9F0"/>
man, improvements in science are progressive and advancing towards perfection. In the course of a few years, such a blaze of physical light was dif∣fused abroad by the industry and ingenuity of philosophers in general, but of physicians and chemists in particular, that the deficiencies and errors of the Baron's elaborate system were ren∣dered obvious to the most weak and inattentive observer. In the important <HI>doctrines</HI> respecting the <HI>causes</HI> of <HI>animal heat</HI> and the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>purposes</HI> of respiration, in particular, entire revolu∣tions were effected by the numerous and ingenious discoveries of chemists in that branch of science denominated aerology.</P>
<P>To supply, as far as possible, the deficiencies of this system of Haller, and to circumvent the errors which the authority of so celebrated a cha∣racter might tend to diffuse throughout the minds of his numerous readers, became <HI>desiderata</HI> of no small moment in the science of physiology.</P>
<P>The most effectual method of accomplishing these desirable ends was too obvious to escape discovery. For as violence is most effectually repelled by counter violence, and one disease not unfrequently removed from the animal system by the impetuous invasion of another, so in like manner, in science, the defects of one system are most advantageously
<PB N="216" REF="028310_0459_0FD89B29158DFD78"/>
supplied, and its errors most effectually contro∣verted and exposed, by the plenitude and unequi∣vocal certainty of the principles of a rival system.</P>
<P>This truth did not escape the observation of that learned and acute professor, of Goettingen, who now fills the chair which was formerly rendered vocal by the eloquence of the immortal Haller. Need I add, that professor Blumenbach is the man to whom I allude—a man, for the completion of whose greatness and utility in physical science, nature and art appear to have all but exhausted their abundant resources! For industry and perse∣verance in the collection of materials, for powers to combine and arrange materials when thus col∣lected, and for ingenuity and acumen to deduce and speculate from such combination and arrange∣ment, the present age certainly boasts few—too few physiologists who may be set in competition with the illustrious Blumenbach.</P>
<P>For this physician and philosopher was reserved the honourable and important task of collecting, digesting and consigning to publicity, a system of physiology destined to supply the deficiencies and correct the errors of that which had already resulted from the labours of his celebrated friend and predecessor. The system of professor Blumen∣bach was, like that of Baron Haller, perfect and
<PB N="217" REF="028310_0460_0FD89B2CB071F270"/>
complete at the time in which it was handed to the world. There existed not, at that period, an established principle, nor scarcely even a probable conjecture in physiology, with which he was not minutely acquainted, and which he did not draw into the extensive and powerful <HI>vortex</HI> of his system.</P>
<P>Had the science of physiology been finally com∣plete at the time in which professor Blumenbach wrote, the industry, the immense resources and the comprehensive talents of that philosopher would, no doubt, have quite precluded the neces∣sity of future systems in this branch of science. But in the unfathomed depths of the animal economy more <HI>arcana</HI> yet existed—more <HI>terra incognita</HI> lay yet unexplored, and further re∣searches of enterprise were therefore essential.</P>
<P>By the combined labours of experimental physi∣ologists in different parts of the world, this branch of science was at length matured for giving birth to another <HI>discovery,</HI> which will probably be found of equal importance, in explaining the phenomena, and in removing the diseases of the animal system, with that which consigned to immortality the name of the illustrious Harvey. The discovery to which I wish at present to direct the attention of the reader is that of, what is usually called <HI>animal
<PB N="218" REF="028310_0461_0FD885C6177BAC48"/>
electricity,</HI> or, of the existence and operation of a fluid extremely similar to electricity in the living animal system. For the fortunate Galvani pro∣fessor of anatomy at Bologna, was reserved the honour of lighting <HI>by accident</HI> on this beautiful and divine discovery—a discovery which entitles its author to be ranked with the great promoters science and the essential benefactors of man.</P>
<P>That such a fluid did actually exist in the bo∣dies of animals, had been long suspected by phy∣siologists and other speculative philosophers. The matter rested however on pure conjecture alone, and was yet unsanctioned by the tests of experi∣ment and observation. The apparent intricacy of the subject depressed the hopes of the boldest experimenters, and the subtlety of the investiga∣tion seemed to throw an insurmountable bar in the road to success. But <HI>accident</HI> not unfrequently does more for the real advancement of science, than boasted genius and industry are able to ac∣complish. It was accident that first suggested to the celebrated Gallileo the construction and use of that optical instrument denominated the <HI>tele∣scope</HI>—It was accident which first led the immortal Newton to the original conception of that prin∣ciple of <HI>gravitation,</HI> by which he afterwards ex∣plained, with such facility, the movements and ex∣quisite balance of the material universe. And it
<PB N="219" REF="028310_0462_0FD89B2F3648E190"/>
was, in like manner, accident—fortunate accident, that first suggested to the industrious and acute Galvani the mode of experimenting, with effect, on the intricate subject of <HI>animal electricity</HI>—a subject which may possibly be destined as the only proper clue to conduct future physiologists to the genuine springs and principles of life itself.</P>
<P>"Whilst the professor (alluding to Galvani) was engaged in dissecting a frog in a room where some of his friends were amusing themselves with an electrical machine, one of them drew a spark from the conductor, at the same time that the professor touched one of the nerves of the animal. In an instant the whole body of the frog was shook by a violent convulsion. The professor was astonished at the phenomenon, and believed it owing to his having wounded the nerve; to assure himself whether this was really the case, he pricked it with the point of his knife, without any motion of the body being produced; he now touched the nerve with the instrument as at first, and ordered a spark to be taken from the machine, on which the contractions were renewed. The experiment was repeated a third time, but the animal remained motionless; however, upon per∣ceiving he held his scalpel by the handle, which was of ivory (a bad conductor), he changed it
<PB N="220" REF="028310_0463_0FD885C8684EF840"/>
for a metallic one, and re-excited the movements, which he constantly failed of doing whilst using an electric substance.</P>
<P>"After having made a number of experiments with the elect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ical machine, he resolved to prose∣cute the subject with atmospheric electricity. To this end he raised a conductor upon the roof of his house, from which he brought an iron wire into his room, and to this attached metal con∣ductors, connected with the nerves of the animals destined to be the subjects of his experiments, and to their legs he tied wires, which reached the floor. Considerable movements were observed in the animals, whether of cold or warm blood, whenever it lightened. These preceded thun∣der, and corresponded with its intensity and re∣petition, and even when it did not lighten the movements took place when any stormy cloud passed over the apparatus."</P>
<P>"Professor Galvani one day suspended some frogs, perhaps with similar views, on metal hooks, fixed in the spine of the back, upon the iron rail∣ing of his garden; several times he remarked that these animals contracted, and appeared to receive shocks; at first he conceived the movements were owing to changes in the atmosphere, but a more
<PB N="221" REF="028310_0464_0FD885D82B856F08"/>
scrupulous examination undeceived him· Having placed a prepared frog <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the reader may not be entirely ignorant of what is meant by a prepared frog, I take the liberty of presenting him with the following brief extract from the first experi∣ment detailed in Dr. Valli's publication: "My first experi∣ment was made on a frog, in the following manner: I opened the abdomen in order to lay bare the spine of the back, and discover the crural nerves which issue from it; a few lines above this point I cut the animal in two, and by passing my scissars immediately under the origin of these nerves, re∣moved the remaining portion of the vertebral column, so as only to leave the vertebrae which united the bundle of nerves. Having enveloped this portion of the vertebrae with a piece of sheet lead, with one end of a metal conductor, I touched the coated part, and with the other the surface of the thighs, which had been previously stripped of the skin. The movements were violent, and continued for a long time," &amp;c. In general, throughout the whole of this physician's expertmental treatise, when one or more of the nerves of an animal are coated with sheet-lead or any other metal, that animal is said to be <HI>prepared.</HI></NOTE> upon an iron plate in his room, and happening with his dissecting forceps to press it against the plate, he observed the move∣ments to take place. This experiment succeeded with all metallic bodies, but more particularly well with silver; non-conducting substances were not proper for it. From this period our author began to suspect the animal possessed an electricity of its own; and in this suspicion he was further con∣firmed by the following circumstance:—He held
<PB N="222" REF="028310_0465_0FD885CC005E3530"/>
a prepared frog by a hook with one hand, so as to let its feet rest upon the bottom of a small sil∣ver cup, which he happened unintentionally to strike with the other; at the instant the body of the animal fell into violent convulsions. If one person held the prepared frog, and another touch∣ed the cup, no movements were excited. The professor being now aware of the necessity of a communication, undertook a series of experiments for the farther investigation of this subject. He first placed a prepared frog upon a non-conduct∣ing surface, and brought one end of a conductor in contact with the hook which secured the ani∣mal, and with the other touched its feet, on which the contractions took place. When the conduct∣ing arch was interrupted by a non-conducting substance, the frog remained motionless, &amp;c."</P>
<P>No sooner had professor Galvani published to the world his experiments on animal electricity, than their same dispread, swift us the intangible fluid which they regarded, throughout the differ∣ent parts of Europe. Animal electricity became, in a short time, a subject of very interesting specu∣lation to medical philosophers. Among the seve∣ral physiologists who entered the lists in this in∣vestigation, the most distinguished whose writings have fallen into my hands, are Dr. Valli, an Italian physician, from whose publication the preceding
<PB N="223" REF="028310_0466_0FD89B309F5CCF00"/>
account respecting the first discoveries of Galvani is extracted, and Mr. Fowler, a native of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he island of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Doctor Valli appears to have led the van of those philosophical characters who first co-ope∣rated with the celebrated Galvani in investigating that animal fluid, the existence of which had been so long suspected, but so lately realised by actual experiment. After repeating most of the experi∣ments of his predecessor in this branch of physics, the Doctor proceeded to a series of new experi∣ments, mostly conceived and instituted by himself.</P>
<P>The objects which he appears to have kept stea∣dily in view throughout the whole course of his experiments and observations were, to ascertain the <HI>nature</HI> of the animal fluid discovered by the professor of Bologna, and to determine its <HI>influ∣ence</HI> and <HI>medium</HI> of operation in the animal eco∣nomy. In the prosecution of these ends the Doc∣tor has doubtless displayed all that industry and patient perseverance, so essentially requisite in the character who would successfully inquire of na∣ture, through the medium of experiment. I am sorry, however, to observe, that all his experiments were not conceived and instituted with equal in∣genuity, and perhaps I may add, not executed with equal accuracy and definitude. Many of
<PB N="224" REF="028310_0467_0FD89B3470BFD7D8"/>
them appear to have been instituted without a di∣rect reference to any specific or particular end— Equally unhappy with regard to conception, inde∣finite with respect to their nature, and inconclu∣sive in point of result, they leave no <HI>impressions</HI> on the mind of the reader, save those of <HI>disap∣pointment</HI> and <HI>regret</HI>—regret that a character of such learning and industry should, notwithstand∣ing, interrogate nature with so little meaning, and (I am sorry to add) with so little success.</P>
<P>The preceding observations must be considered only in the light of <HI>general rules,</HI> and as such, are liable to numerous exceptions. Many of the experiments of Dr. Valli are, doubtless, both in∣genious and valuable; and I even entertain the utmost confidence, that the period will yet arrive, when the whole of them, that are ascertained and related with justness and definitude, will be made subservient to the establishment of general and useful results. At present, however, they stand in an <HI>insulated</HI> state, completely detached from practical conclusions, and disconnected from all known principles in physical science.</P>
<P>After a series of experiments sufficiently lengthy and tedious, the Doctor conceived himself une∣quivocally authorised to conclude, that the animal fluid of Galvani, was entirely the same with the
<PB N="225" REF="028310_0468_0FD885D1C98D9650"/>
subtle matter of electricity. This conclusion he alleges to be the spontaneous and necessary result of the following positions, which he delivers as substantiated and confirmed by actual experiment.</P>
<P>"First, substances which conduct electricity, are conductors likewise of the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="2">"2<HI>dly,</HI> Substances which are not conductors of electricity, do not conduct the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="3">"3<HI>dly,</HI> Non-conducting bodies, which acquire by heat the property of conducting electricity, preserve it likewise for the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="4">"4<HI>thly,</HI> Cold at a certain degree, renders water a non-conductor of electricity, as well as of the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="5">"5<HI>thly,</HI> The velocity of the nervous fluid is, as far as we can calculate, the same with that of electricity."</P>
<P N="6">"6<HI>thly,</HI> The obstacles which the nerves, under certain circumstances, oppose to electricity, they present likewise to the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="7">"7<HI>thly,</HI> Attraction is a property of the electric fluid, and this property has been discovered in the nervous fluid."</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="028310_0469_0FD89B35B7FD6F60"/>Having enumerated and detailed the foregoing arguments, the Doctor, in an effusion of triumph, subjoins, "We here see the greatest analogy be∣tween these fluids; nay, I may even add, the cha∣racters of their identity."</P>
<P>As an additional support to the same opinion, Dr Valli adduces the peculiar and striking pheno∣mena exhibited by the <HI>torpedo,</HI> the <HI>gymnotus elec∣tricus,</HI> the <HI>silurus,</HI> &amp;c. which proceed, as he alleges, from a fluid in every respect the same with that which was discovered in frogs, by the professor of anatomy at Bologna. As the Doctor, however, has advanced nothing in confirmation of such entire sameness, save a certain remote analogy which he says he has discovered between the mus∣cles of animals, and the <HI>electrical apparatus</HI> of the torpedo, the gymnotus, &amp;c. it is obvious that this latter argument will but very slightly impress the philosophical physiologist, who founds his belief of principles on <HI>facts,</HI> rather than on vague and visionary <HI>conjectures.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus, as he supposed, satisfactorily ascer∣tained the identity of the <HI>nervous</HI> with the electric fluid, he next proceeds to speculations on its in∣fluence in the diversified movements and functions of the animal economy. To me, however, I must confess, the greater part of this speculative inves∣tigation, appears to be rather the effervescent
<PB N="227" REF="028310_0470_0FD89B372CCEA460"/>
effusions of an <HI>imagination,</HI> heated to excess in a favourite pursuit, than the solemn <HI>decisions</HI> of a tranquil and unbiassed <HI>understanding.</HI> I acknow∣ledge myself unable, in many instances, to discern the necessary nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s or affinity between his con∣clusions, and the facts from which they are de∣duced:—or perhaps I may speak my sentiments more fully when I say, that the learned author appears not unfrequently to have substituted mere <HI>hypothetical allegations,</HI> for fair and logical <HI>conclu∣sions</HI>—the vacant results of his own conjectures, for genuine principles developed by experiment, and ascertained by observation. It very often happens, that by attempting to embrace too much under a single cause, we extend the tortured principle beyond its natural limits, and thus, to appearance, weaken or render doubtful its influ∣ence, even on those phenomena which it immedi∣ately regards. This observation applies with too much propriety and force, to the speculations of the indefatigable Valli. By attempting to explain <HI>all,</HI> he has in fact explained <HI>none,</HI> of the pheno∣mena of the animal economy, by that subtle fluid on which he so patiently experimented. Many of his physiological facts and speculations are indeed ingenious and interesting, but, in my view, they are equally deducible from any other series of experi∣ments, as from that by which they are preceded in the Doctor's publication. Many of the learned author's facts may be, no doubt, true and well
<PB N="228" REF="028310_0471_0FD89B38AFAAFCD8"/>
defined, and some of his principles and results to a certain degree interesting to the physician and philosopher, but, taken in the aggregate, they are too disjointed to constitute any thing like a system, too disconnected to form a regular chain of investigation. On my mind, his <HI>speculations</HI> on the causes of <HI>muscular motion, sensation secre∣tion</HI> and <HI>nutrition,</HI> impress no more solid convic∣tion than do <HI>those</HI> of Stahl on the subject of his <HI>anima medica,</HI> of Van Helmont respecting his subtle <HI>Archeus,</HI> or of the airy Paracelsus with re∣gard to his <HI>planetary influence.</HI> Notwithstanding the apparent severity of the foregoing observa∣tions, I am still obliged to declare it as my opinion, that the novelty and importance of the subject on which Dr Valli has experimented and written, entitle his work to the particular atten∣tion of the learned and ingenious of every na∣tion.</P>
<P>For the want of system and requisite decision in the writings of the preceding author, compensation is, in a great measure, made by a subsequent pub∣lication of the accurate and ingenious Fowler. The experiments and speculations of this young philoso∣pher, on what he terms, the "<HI>influence discovered by Galvani,</HI>" made their first public appearance at Edinburgh, in the course of the year 1793: they are not, indeed, so numerous as those of the Italian physician, but they appear to have been
<PB N="229" REF="028310_0472_0FD89B3A3260ED48"/>
conceived with more design, and executed with more judgment. Mr. Fowler seems to have been among the first who controverted the opinion of Galvani and Valli, respecting the identity of the nervous and electric fluids: and he has, doubtless, controverted it with ability and effect.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler prelimina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es his observations, with a lucid and forcible statement of a certain previous combination of circumstances, which he alleges, must have strongly prepossessed the mind of professor Galvani, with a belief of the sameness of the pre∣ceding fluids.</P>
<P>That such a prepo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion must have had, indeed, a powerful effect on the subsequent deductions and conclusions of the Professor, will be readily ac∣knowledged, by every one who has experienced the influence of preconceived opinions—an influ∣ence pregnant with error, and leading countless evils in its train.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler proceeds then to mention the first object which engaged his attention, in the com∣mencement of his interesting inquiry, and which appears well calculated to pave the way, for the more easy and effectual accomplishment of his experimental course. This, to make use of his own words, was, "to ascertain, as well the va∣rious
<PB N="230" REF="028310_0473_0FD89B3DF44E26E8"/>
circumstances, essentially requisite to the production of these new phenomena, as those in which they can be rendered most obvious." The issue of his enquiry on this subject, I will also lay before the reader in his own words. "After" says he, "a great variety of experiments, of which it would be unnecessary here, to relate more than the result, I found, that I could not excite in an animal the appearances described by Galvani, with any substances whatever, whether solid or fluid, except the metals: and that the mutual contact of two different metals with each other, so far as I was able to determine, was in every case necessary to the effect."</P>
<P>After a satisfactory attainment of this object, the ingenious author next proceeds to a judicious series of experiments, with a view to discover the genuine nature of the animal fluid, first realised by the fortunate professor of Bologna. Of those ex∣periments he does not give us a minute specifica∣tion, but only furnishes statements of their most obvious and striking results. These statements he also occasionally intersperses with interesting and important remarks, and some very ingenious spe∣culations.</P>
<P>Having finished his series of experiments, (a series sufficiently numerous and diversified for the
<PB N="231" REF="028310_0474_0FD89B402F1D7E30"/>
stablishment of general principles) relative to the nature of the nervous fluid, and its affinity to the matter of electricity, Mr. Fowler at length favours us on this subject with the following conclusions, which I shall take the liberty of presenting to the reader in the words of their ingenious anther.</P>
<P>After having stated a few analogies between the animal fluid of Galvani, and that possessed by the <HI>torpedo,</HI> he then reverses the comparison, and lays down several points of essential difference, not only between the two preceding fluids, but also between the former of them, namely the fluid of Galvani, and the matter of electricity.</P>
<P>"This influence, (says he, referring to the nervous fluid of animals) differs, both from that of the torpedo, &amp;c. and from electricity, in pro∣ducing no sensation (in man at least) at all similar to that of an electrical shock."</P>
<P>"—That some kind of disagreeable sensation is occasioned by it, even in frogs, independent of that which must necessarily arise from irritation and the contractions of their muscles, is evident from their restlessness and expressions of uneasiness. In other animals, as I shall afterwards have occa∣sion to shew, these expressions are still less equi∣vocal: and in man we can ascertain both their
<PB N="232" REF="028310_0475_0FD885D2FA3D2630"/>
degree and their kind. That they differ consider∣ably from such as are produced by electricity will be proved when I come to speak of the effects of this influence upon our senses."</P>
<P>"But the most important, and characteristic difference which I have yet been able to discover, between this new influence and electricity, consists in their effects upon the contractile power of animals and of plants. The contractions of ani∣mals excited by electricity have a tendency to destroy that power upon which contractions de∣pend. But the contractions excited, by the appli∣cation of the metals, have, in all my experiments, had the directly opposite effect. The more fre∣quently contractions have been in this way excited, the longer do they continue excitable: and the longer are the parts upon which such experiments are made, preserved from putridity. An influ∣ence, capable of exciting contractions without occa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ioning exhaustion, was a thing I so little expected to find, and so contrary to the character which had been given of this both by Galvani and by Doctor Valli, that I at first distrusted my own observation of the fact: but the number of comparative experiments which I had afterwards occasion to make, though with views different from that of ascertaining the point in question, convinced me that this influence, so far from
<PB N="233" REF="028310_0476_0FD89B41D859DB30"/>
destroying the contractility of muscles, has a ten∣dency to preserve it. Oxygene is, so far as I know, the only stimulus in nature, whose effects are at all analogous."</P>
<P>"When a frog has been long dead, I have been sometimes more than a quarter of an hour without being able to excite a single contraction by the application of the metals: but after this, without at all varying the means employed, con∣tractions have appeared, and have become gradu∣ally more and more vigorous."</P>
<P>"It is said (for I have never had an opportunity of making the experiment), that a stream of elec∣tricity, passed through a sensitive plant, produces an almost immediate collapse of its leaves. But the influence discovered by Galvani produced no such effect in the following experiment. Having separated the leg of a frog from its body, I freed its crural nerves from surrounding parts, and with one hand held it supported upon the end of a probe. An assistant placed a piece of silver under its foot, and held the zinc with which it was to be touched. A sensative plant formed the medium of communication between us. He held the bot∣tom of its stem between his fingers, while I held the top; so that when the silver was touched by the zinc, the influence passed up the plant, and
<PB N="234" REF="028310_0477_0FD89B46682851B8"/>
through the whole of its stem. The frog's leg instantly contracted, and repeated its contractions every time the silver and zinc were brought in contact: but the leaves of the plant did not col∣lapse; neither did they when any of its branches formed part of the circuit."</P>
<P>I must however, confess that the plant, upon which this experiment was made, had been kept through the winter. With a young one the result might possibly be different; but such an one I have not yet had in my power to procure.</P>
<P>"The torpedo does not appear at all affected by the influence which itself produces. Animals in which Galvani's phenomena are produced, are strongly affected."</P>
<P>The very ingenious author passes on next to report the result of certain experiments which he instituted, in order to refute the opinion of those, who allege, that the fluid of Galvani proceeds entirely from the metallic substances used, and does not reside at all in any part of the animal system. In his enquiry respecting this point he displays the same fertility in devising, the same sagacity in judging, and the same ingenuity in deducing, which so forcibly impress the reader throughout every part of his experimental investi∣gation.
<PB N="235" REF="028310_0478_0FD89B4AB01AD5A8"/>
He also farther shows, that the nervous influence of Galvani, and the subtle fluid of elec∣tricity differ very materially from each other in the following particular, namely, that against the effects of the former, animals are able to guard themselves by means of a certain voluntary e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣tion, whereas the operation of the latter is not in the smallest degree subject to the controul or in∣fluence of the will.</P>
<P>Having finished the consideration of the <HI>nature,</HI> Mr. Fowler proceeds to make some useful <HI>appli∣cations,</HI> of the influence discovered by the professor of anatomy at Bologna. In his attempts to shed light on certain controverted points, and to solve certain abstruse questions, in physiology, by means of this fluid, he appears no less ingenious and satisfactory than in the former parts of his enquiry.</P>
<P>He appears peculiarly happy and conclusive in his researches after the <HI>source</HI> from whence the nerves and muscles derive their respective powers. I beg leave to lay before the reader two of the author's experiments, instituted for the purpose of ascertaining this interesting particular—a particular which has so long furnished a subject of contro∣versy among speculative physiologists. The latter of the two experiments, (to which the former
<PB N="236" REF="028310_0479_0FD885D82933E5B8"/>
serves only as a necessary introduction) is of itself more than equal to all that has ever been ad∣vanced on the opposite side of the question.</P>
<P>EXPERIMENT I.</P>
<P>"I divided (says Mr. Fowler) the sciatic nerve of one leg, and tied the crural artery of the other in a large frog. Scarcely any blood was lost in doing either. Two days aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this I strangled it. During the first 24 hours, the leg in which the nerve had been divided, appeared to contract with the most vigour; after this period the difference between them became more doubtful; but the contractions were at no time stronger in the leg whose artery was tied, than in that whose nerve was divided.</P>
<P>EXPERIMENT II.</P>
<P>"The same operations were performed upon a large female frog full of spawn. Four hours afterwards she was covered by a male, who had been treated in a similar manner. I mention this circumstance, as it tends to prove, that the pain occasioned by the operation was probably not so great as to produce much fallacy.</P>
<P>"On the day following, she had spawned, and on the sixth day from the operations, she was strangled. When laid upon a plate of zinc, and
<PB N="237" REF="028310_0480_0FD89B4F6521AD20"/>
excited by means of a rod of silver, the contrac∣tions were found extremely feeble in the leg whose artery had been tied, and ceased altogether in about twenty-two hours after her death.</P>
<P>In the leg, whose nerve had been divided, they appeared as vigorous as they usually are in legs to which no injury has been previously done, and continued excitable upwards of two days after they had ceased to be so in the other."</P>
<P>It may be proper on the present occasion briefly to observe, that the influence discovered by Gal∣vani was the test used by Mr. Fowler to determine the existence or cessation of irritability in the muscles of the animals subjected to the preceding experiment. For this influence, as our author judiciously observes, appears to be indeed by far the best and most delicate test that has ever yet been discovered for ascertaining the lowest possible degrees of muscular irritability. After having become wholly insensible to the impressions of all other stimuli, muscles still continue to vibrate to the kindred touches of this subtle fluid, to which nature appears to have given them such a nice, and, perhaps I may say, specific correspondence.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler, after having transiently glanced on the subject of inflammation, passes on to the
<PB N="238" REF="028310_0481_0FD89B53723B96B0"/>
attack of a physiological doctrine, propagated with zeal, and supported with ability by that celebrated experimentalist, the Abbe Fontana. The doctrine alluded to, embraces the existence or residence of a certain vital principle in the volume of the blood. On this principle, as the industrious Abbe alleges, poisons produce their instantaneous effect, when introduced into the vascular systems of living animals. To all the different parts of this physical <HI>doctrine</HI> I could never yet be induced to subscribe, notwithstanding the respectability of its learned and numerous advocates.</P>
<P>By attacking and vanquishing one of its most powerful champions, Mr. Fowler has doubtless contributed much to its final demolition. For, in the contest now under our immediate conside∣ration, I must confess, that to me the laurels of victory appear to be fairly wrested from the silvered temples of the <HI>Italian,</HI> and planted over the youthful brow of the <HI>British</HI> Philosopher.</P>
<P>I have thus exhibited a view, somewhat general indeed, though confessedly very succinct, of the results laid down, and of the opinions entertained, by the ingenious Fowler, on the subject of the animal influence discovered by Professor Galvani. To lay before the reader a full account of all that is useful and important in the observations of this
<PB N="239" REF="028310_0482_0FD89B548869A020"/>
interesting author, would be to transcribe and re∣print his whole publication.</P>
<P>The only productions in the English language, which this country now furnishes, professedly on the subject of the animal fluid discovered by Gal∣vani, are (as formerly observed) those of Fowler and Valli. On the comparative merit of those two authors I will here take the liberty of advancing a few general, and, I flatter myself, impartial, observations:</P>
<P>The experiments of Doctor Valli are more numerous and pompous—those of Mr. Fowler more definite and intelligible. The former author appears <HI>often,</HI> the latter, <HI>never,</HI> to have experi∣mented without some determinate end in view. The experiments of the Italian may be compared to the promiscuous plants of the forest, strewn at random by the sportive and irregular hand of nature—those of the young Briton, to choice and valuable collections, arranged with order and elegance, in a well regulated and beautiful garden. The experiments of Valli appear to throw into <HI>shade,</HI> those of Fowler into <HI>light,</HI> the objects which they immediately regard. From the for∣mer, the reader collects information with diffi∣culty, from the latter, without labour or painful attention.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="028310_0483_0FD89B5CB8A01418"/>In their deductions and speculations, the two preceding authors are no less dissimilar, than with regard to their experiments themselves. Valli is more diffuse and often hypothetical—Fowler more pointed and generally conclusive. Valii appears to give loosened reins to a glowing imagination— Fowler to be constantly under the steady guidance of a powerful and well-cultivated understanding. The former makes a greater display of learning, and, therefore, too frequently views objects through the more obscure <HI>media</HI> of previous publications—the latter exhibits a higher degree of ingenuity, and derives the principal part of his information, not from pages, sanctioned only by the names of celebrated, yet fallible, authors, but from the great <HI>folio</HI>-volume of <HI>nature,</HI> impressed with her own signature. On the whole, Valli has experimented and written in the most lengthy and profuse—Fowler in the most definite and conclusive manner. In many parts of the writings of the former, nothing else than the <HI>fiat</HI> of an almighty genius would be able to bring <HI>order</HI> out of <HI>confusion</HI>—in those of the latter, lucidity, con∣nection, and regularity, shine pre-eminent through almost every page.</P>
<P>Having thus, without reserve, delivered my sentiments on the <HI>publications of others,</HI> I hope I may be allowed to trespass on the reader's attention
<PB N="241" REF="028310_0484_0FD885DAAD1E1838"/>
while I make a few observations relating to <HI>my own.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing could have induced me thus hastily to forsake the humble, but secure, retreats of obscu∣rity, and risk myself before the eye of the world in the hazardous character of an author, save a solicitous wish to contribute to the advancement of medical science, and thus aid in acquiring for man a more effectual exemption from misery and pain. I saw with regret the literary treasures of a Blumenbach concealed from the view of my fellow-citizens beneath the drapery of an ancient and an obsolete language. I was anxiously desirous to see the physiological system of that illustrious character completely clothed in the language of my country. I engaged in the trans∣lation of this work, not because I conceived my∣self better qualified for its execution than others, but because others appeared to me unpardonably remiss with regard to the undertaking. The execution proved laborious and difficult beyond my expectations. The difficulty of detecting an author's precise meaning through the dusky medium of a Latin expression, can be fully under∣stood and realised only by him who has made the arduous experiment.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="028310_0485_0FD885E5A70D67F0"/>Even after the ideas and opinions in the original are fully embraced and completely comprehended, another difficulty of no small magnitude still remains, namely, to convey them to the reader with unequivocal definitude, through the indefinite medium of a different language. It is well known how extremely liable we are to misapprehend the precise meaning of an author who even writes in our own vernacular tongue, much more so of one who publishes in a language but little used in con∣versation, and, at best, but imperfectly understood by any man living.</P>
<P>Should the foregoing translation ever fall into the hands of the celebrated professor of Geottingen, I hope he will receive, with candour and indul∣gence, a well meant attempt to extend the empire of his utility and his fame, by increasing the number of his admiring readers. If the transla∣tion be in any part erroneous, in any part defi∣cient, strictures and corrections will be thankfully received, and punctually attended to in a second edition of the work, should a second be demanded by a patronising public.</P>
<P>To preserve as far as possible the firm and energetic spirit which characterizes the writings of the illustrious professor of Goettingen, and to
<PB N="143" REF="028310_0486_0FD89B622FC508D0"/>
convey to my readers the facts, the principles, the speculations, and the opinions contained in his original work, without even the shadow of altera∣tion, diminution, or addition, has been my steady and uniform aim throughout the whole of the foregoing translation. Owing, however, to the different <HI>constitutions</HI> or <HI>idioms,</HI> as they are more generally termed, of the Latin and English lan∣guages, my translation is in many places far—very far from being strictly literal. <HI>Phraseology</HI> I con∣sider, at best, as the mere trappings or drapery of <HI>composition,</HI> while <HI>facts</HI> and <HI>principles</HI> constitute its more substantial and important part. To preserve the latter, therefore, inviolate, and to communicate them with the utmost definitude, is the indispen∣sible duty of a translator, from a principle of justice to the original author, to the public, and to himself; but in my opinion, he is not bound, by any principle whatever, to make an entire sacrifice of all <HI>elegance</HI> and <HI>beauty,</HI> to mere puncti∣lious <HI>literality</HI> of expression. Impressed with the propriety and truth of these sentiments, I have, throughout the whole of the foregoing work, been sometimes <HI>literal</HI> and sometimes <HI>free,</HI> accordingly as the one or the other mode of translation gave birth to a phraseology or stile most agreeable to my ear, and most accordant to the spirit of the original composition.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="028310_0487_0FD89B6674222160"/>With respect to the appendix itself, it may not be amiss to make it the subject of a few transient observations. The <HI>principle</HI> which these additi∣onal pages regard, and are intended to commu∣nicate, is justly becoming, among medical philoso∣phers, an object of primary importance. This principle opens to the view of the speculative mind a rich and spacious field, never yet printed, save by the adventurous steps of a few pre-eminently active and enterprising physiologists—A field, the salutary fruits of which will, no doubt, at a future day, serve to elucidate the nature, to develope the composition, and to alleviate the complicated misery of man.</P>
<P>My whole design in this appendix is to give a condensed, but somewhat general view, of this principle or influence discovered by professor Gal∣vani.</P>
<P>By far the greater number of medical charac∣ters in the immense tract of country embraced within the limits of the <HI>United States,</HI> are, in con∣sequence of their distances from literary institu∣tions, excluded from access to public libraries, and situated quite beyond the free circulation of physical science. To such my appendix will serve the humble purpose of a <HI>literary chronicle;</HI> it will convey to them a brief account of the discoveries
<PB N="245" REF="028310_0488_0FD89B67EC4FDB58"/>
which are now going forward in the delightful and important science of physiology.</P>
<P>On the subject of the influence discovered by Galvani I have myself instituted and performed a considerable number of experiments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the reader may be acquainted with an easy, cheap and familiar method of experimenting on this subject, with∣out having his feelings hurt by the agonizing pangs of tor∣tured and dying animals, I will here take the liberty of in∣serting, in form of notes, a few extracts taken from a com∣munication transmitted to Mr. Fowler, by his learned friend Mr. Robison, professor of natural philosophy in the univer∣sity of Edinburgh.</P>
<P N="1">I. "I find (says the professor) that if a piece of zinc be applied to the tongue, and be in contact with a piece of sil∣ver, which touches any part of the lining of the mouth, nostrils, ears, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rethra, or anus, the sensation resembling taste is felt on the tongue. If the experiment be inverted, by ap∣plying the silver to the tongue, the irritation produced by the zinc is not sensible, except in the mouth and the urethra, and is very flight.</P>
<P N="2">II. "If the zinc (finely polished) be applied to the ball of the eye, the brightness of the flash seems to correspond with the surface of contact of the silver with the tongue, palate, fauces, or cheek. The same thing happens when the silver is applied to the eye."</P>
<P N="3">III. "When a rod of zinc and one of silver are applied to the roof of the mouth, as far back as possible, the irrita∣tions produced by bringing their outer ends into contact, are very strong, and that by the zinc resembles taste, in the same manner as when applied to the tongue."</P>
<P N="4">IV. "I had been paring my toe nails with scissars, and had cut off a considerable portion of the thick skin, so that the blood began to <HI>ooze</HI> through in the middle of the wound. I applied the zinc there, and an extensive surface of silver to the tongue. Every time I brought the metals into con∣tact, I felt a smart irritation by the zinc at the wound," &amp;c.</P>
<P>A variety of other experiments of a similar nature are contained in the same communication from Mr. Robison to Mr. Fowler; but a further detail of them I conceive un∣necessary, as the ingenious reader, being acquainted with the foregoing, can with facility devise other experiments for himself. Thus I have frequently conveyed to my eye the luminous flash mentioned by Mr. Robison, not only from the internal vestments of the mouth, the nose, the ure∣thra, &amp;c. but also from between my fingers, from the cu∣bital flexure of my arm, and from various other parts of my body, where the texture of the cuticle and skin is more fine and soft than ordinary; always taking care, however, to moisten the part previously to the application of the metals.</P></NOTE>; some of
<PB N="246" REF="028310_0489_0FD885DEE81DC298"/>
my results have appeared striking and new, but my experiments have been neither sufficiently nume∣rous nor varied to warrant the deduction and esta∣blishment of general principles. My present in∣tention is (should heaven indulge me in life and health), to prosecute to some extent this highly
<PB N="247" REF="028310_0490_0FD89B6E70A0A390"/>
interesting subject. Should my investigation be favoured with the discovery of any thing curious in science, or useful in practice, a detail of it may be expected in a future communication.</P>
<P>To my solemn audit before the bar of the pub∣lic, I now hasten in tremulous anxiety, "with all my imperfections on my head,"—imperfections which will no doubt awaken the censure of the critic, but receive, I flatter myself, the indulgence of the liberal and candid. The approbation of the former I neither court nor regard; that of the latter it shall be my constant ambition to de∣serve. The professed business of most modern critics appears to be, to condemn—promiscuously condemn, too frequently without the faintest sha∣dow of either inclination or talents to discriminate merit from its reverse.</P>
<P>In my view the <HI>approbation</HI> of a professed critic is perfectly synonymous with the <HI>censure</HI> of the liberal and the ingenious, to whose candid exami∣nation the preceding pages are submitted with all that respect and deference due from an inexperi∣enced writer.</P>
