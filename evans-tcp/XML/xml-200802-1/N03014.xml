<HEAD>The Lusts of Men the Cause of Wars.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>James IV. I.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your Lusts that war in your Members?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is no one Subject that has taken up so much Room in the many Histo∣ries of the World in general, or of Na∣tions in particular, as the Wars and Fightings that have been either among themselves, or against one another. Nor has there any thing given Occasion for so many Men to signalize them∣selves by their Conduct and Valour, and transmit their Names with Honour to future Generations, and even to the latest Posterity, as their remarka∣ble Atchievements in Military Enterprizes.</P>
<P>But now in order to regulate our Apprehensions of war in general, and to judge when and how far it is lawful or unlawful; in order also to adjust our Ideas of those <HI>Men of War,</HI> whose Names sound great in History, for their martial Genius and mighty Conquests; and to distinguish between those who have been famous for a generous Zeal, and an heroick Courage in maintaining and defending their just Rights against their invading Foes, and those who have been no less infamous for their Oppression and Violence, Tyranny and Cruelty:
<PB N="6" REF="003623_0004_10023536CF9F8AD0"/>
And lastly, in order to our understanding with what Views any should be seeking Military Skill, and with what Spirit they should enter upon and go forth to War; it is highly requisite to trace the Subject up to its Fountain Head, and consider the Origin of all the Wars and Fightings that are or have been in the World.</P>
<P>And here we shall find that the World in its primitive Innocency and Perfection knew no such Thing. For the wise Creator of the Universe dis∣posed every thing into such wonderful Order and exact Harmony, that there was not the least Jar or Schism, nor the least Opposition or Discord in the natural or moral World.</P>
<P>And therefore it must needs be our falling from the original Rectitude of our Nature, and the suf∣fering Sin and Lust to enter into our Hearts, that has given Birth to all the Contentions and Confu∣sions, the Wars and Bloodsheds that have been among the Children of Men. And this is what the inspired Author of this Epistle gives us an Ac∣count, or at least leads us into the Apprehension of. <HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence even of your Lusts that war in your Members?</HI> This Epistle as you may see by the first Verse of it, was directed to the Twelve Tribes that were scattered abroad. And such was the Un∣happiness of of the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation, that as they (thro their Pride by reason of their distinguishing Privileges) despised all other People; so they were generally hated of those among whom they came: and seldom lived peaceably with them, or indeed one with another; but were continually at Vari∣ance among themselves, or quarrelling with their Nei'bours. And these Contentions and Quarrels being, as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitby in loc.</NOTE> <HI>Josephus</HI> observes, not only in <HI>Judea,</HI> but
<PB N="7" REF="003623_0005_1002352EFAD86078"/>
in <HI>Alexandria, Syria,</HI> and many other Places, were doubtless the Cause of setting the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire against them, to such a degree as brought on the dreadful Destruction of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, which is supposed to have come upon them seven or eight Years after this Epistle was written.</P>
<P>But then if we consider this Epistle as directed to the Christian <HI>Jews,</HI> yet they even after their Conversion retained too much of their old Temper, which threw them into many Contests and Quar∣rels about Matters of Religion, as well as those of a civil Nature. And the Author of this Epistle observing with Grief and great Concern of Soul, the unchristian Heats and Tumults which these Professors of Christianity did so frequently fall into, is for leading them up to the Source and Ori∣ginal of them, as the most powerful Argument to discourage and disswade them from such Broils and Quarrels for the future. <HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence even of your Lusts?</HI> He don't put these things by way of Interrogation, as if he was at a loss or uncertain whether they took their Original from hence or no, but we are to look upon it as an oratorical artful way of speaking, that he might perswade them into the same Apprehension with himself, that all the Wars and Fightings that were among them arose from their Lusts, or <HI>their<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> Pleasures,</HI> as in the Margin, and which is observed to be the most common Signification of the Word; but then it must be understood in this place of such Plea∣sures as arise from the Gratification of some Lust or other, and then it comes to the same thing with our Lusts. <HI>That war in your Members;</HI> i. e. in all the Faculties of our Nature, both of the Mind and
<PB N="8" REF="003623_0006_1002354A8EA89040"/>
of the Body; the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Leigh.</HI> Crit. Sac.</NOTE> Word as is observed, bearing such an extensive Signification.</P>
<P>There are spiritual and fleshly Lusts, and they all war in our Members, they militate one with ano∣ther, and all of them against the Faculties of our Souls and the Members of our Bodies. And these Lusts that are thus at war within, the Apostle tells us are the Cause of all the Wars and Fightings that are without. Accordingly these are the two Points in the Text that I propose to speak briefly to. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There are Lusts that war within us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That these Lusts are the Cause of all the Wars and Fightings that are among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P>And then I intend to improve and apply the Truths, by which you will see that my Text coun∣tenances the Designs and Purposes of this Day, fur∣ther than at first View some of you may be appre∣hensive of.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There are Lusts that war within us.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Lusts</HI> we are to understand irregular Affec∣tions and inordinate Appetites or Desires. <HI>Lusts</HI> are not any new Affections or Desires that differ in Nature from those that were originally planted in our Constitution. But when Men's natural Affecti∣ons and Appetites are fixed upon improper Ob∣jects, or carried out to an inordinate Degree, and the Gratification pursued in an irregular Manner, then they become LUSTS.</P>
<P>And by the Indulgence of one such Lust or in∣ordinate Desire in our first Parents, their Souls were betrayed, and a multitude of them brake in im∣mediately, and got possession of their Nature; and so intimately united with their Constitutions, as to
<PB N="9" REF="003623_0007_10023524B50A79D8"/>
become natural to them, and so by natural Gene∣ration are transmitted to their Offspring; inso∣much that there are now within us Lusts of every kind, according to the several Faculties and Affec∣tions of the Soul, Sensations and Appetites of the Body, which are distinguished into spiritual and fleshly and worldly Lusts; which several kinds of Lusts, are comprized and distinguished by the Apostle, into <HI>the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</HI> 1. <HI>Joh.</HI> 2. 16. Now all these Lusts war in our Members: they keep up a perpetual Contest and Struggle within us.</P>
<P>Here let me say,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>These Lusts are at war one with another.</HI></P>
<P>The Lusts of Men, altho' they have a likeness in some respects, yet are far from having any real Harmony or Agreement among themselves. For as they have all one common Nature, which consists in irregular Motions and Desires of the Flesh and Spirit, so the natural Tendency of them must needs be to jar and jostle one with ano∣ther. They have all different Views and Inte∣rests, and are pursuing different Designs; and what will be the natural Effect hereof, but the thwart∣ing and opposing each other continually? The Lusts of the Flesh interfering with those of the Spirit, in seeking after their several Gratificati∣ons, and worldly Lusts opposing them both; Pride, Luxury and Intemperance, being all opposed by Covetousness or an inordinate Desire after an hoard of earthly Riches. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>These Lusts do all war in our Members, even against our Souls and Bodies.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' they are at continual Variance among themselves; yet as the <HI>Jews</HI> of old, in the midst of their civil Discords and Divisions, when <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI> was besieged, would unite their Forces a∣gainst
<PB N="10" REF="003623_0008_100201EA95C614D8"/>
their common Enemy, so these disagree∣ing Lusts all unite against <HI>us</HI> as their common E∣nemy. These wicked and unreasonable Lusts, have entered into a Confederacy, rather a Conspiracy against us, and are offering the utmost Violence to our Natures. They have usurped the Domini∣on, and gotten the Possession of our Souls and Bodies, so as to weaken and deprave the Facul∣ties of the one, and to make use of the Members of the other, as <HI>the Instruments of Unrighteousness unto Sin.</HI></P>
<P>These rebellious Lusts have turned Reason off the Throne, and Conscience from the Judgment-Seat: and as for the Will and Affections, they have so conquered and corrupted them, that they have in a great measure, if not entirely, brought them over to their Side. But now, the noble in∣tellective Powers of the Soul, are far from being easy while their Rights are thus invaded, and their Prerogatives thus encroached upon; and by the Means and Helps that God affords them, in his Word and by his Spirit, they are for recover∣ing their original Dignity and Authority. And hence arises a perpetual Struggle in the Man, the Flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the Spirit a∣gainst the Flesh, as the Apostle expresses it, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 17.</P>
<P>Thus every Man becomes the Seat of War and the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>But oh! what Calamities! what Desolations! what Destruction and Misery! has this intestine War bro't upon us! what Tumult, what Confu∣sion does it keep us in perpetually! How do these violent and impetuous Lusts, either by setting themselves in Battle-array, bear down all the Dic∣tates of Reason, Revelation and Conscience, and even force us to yield to their sinful Demands!
<PB N="11" REF="003623_0009_1002353E055A73F0"/>
or how by the secret and sudden Sallies of some particular Lusts, best acquainted with our Tempers and Circumstances, take us at unawares, and carry us away <HI>captive at their Will?</HI></P>
<P>And Oh! how base and cruel are these usurp∣ing Tyrants, when they have gotten us into their Hands!</P>
<P>How do they profane and prostitute our Bodies (designed for the Temples of the holy Ghost, and that God has curiously wrought in the low∣er parts of the Earth, and made in such a fear∣ful and wonderful Manner as we now behold them) to all our base and filthy Desires! and instead of having any regard to our Health, and the preservation of our Constitution, every Member is made a Slave to some base Lust or o∣ther, and rather than deny themselves any Grati∣fications, they will abuse our Bodies to such a de∣gree, as to bring on Weakness and Pains, Diseases and Death it self.</P>
<P>And then again, these insulting Lusts are no less abusive to our Souls. For instead of paying a proper regard to the dignity of their superiour Nature, and a due defference to the Dictates of their nobler Powers, which carry a Majesty with them, they will vent their utmost Fury at them, as being their most potent Adversaries, and that give the greatest disturbance to their sinful In∣dulgences. These therefore they bend all their Force against, that if possible they might prevail over them, to such a degree, as to go on in the Pleasures of Sin without any Check or controul from them. And the uncircumcised Philistins never dealt more basely with <HI>Sampson</HI> their great Enemy, than these Lusts do with our Souls. <HI>They put out the Eyes</HI> of our Understandings, and make us <HI>grind</HI> unto them: improving our Skill and
<PB N="12" REF="003623_0010_1002352766EDE588"/>
Knowledge in projecting and contriving for their further gratification. And how do they abuse an Understanding thus blinded as to Spiritual Things, calling for it upon every Occasion, to find some way or other to please and <HI>make Sport</HI> for them?</P>
<P>In Short, there are no insults too gross for these Lusts to offer to the Soul. They care not how they wrong and wound it; and rather than deny a Lust they will degrade and defile the Soul, and make us more vile than the Beasts that perish. To please a Lust, they will put the Soul upon the Rack, and by reason of guilty Fears fill it with the utmost Horrours and Distress; nay they will kill and destroy it forever, if it be not rescued out of their Hands by the Almighty Grace of God.</P>
<P>Thus these wicked and unreasonable Lusts war in our Members, even against all the Members of our Bodies and the Faculties of our Souls.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the Second general Head,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>These Lusts that thus war in our Members, are the Cause of all the Wars and Fightings that are among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence even of your Lusts?</HI> The Lusts of Men don't confine their malign Influence with∣in the very Persons they have gotten the Posses∣sion of, but being insatiable in their Desires as well as unreasonable in their Demands those Men that are under the Government of them, naturally fall into Broils and Contests one with another. For as different Lusts in the same Subject are conti∣nually jarring with each other, so not only dif∣ferent Lusts, but even the same Lusts in different Subjects, will naturally set them at Variance, and be a means of their breaking forth into Quarrels, and oftentimes at length into Wars and Blood∣sheds.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003623_0011_100201E526E71758"/>
These are they that <HI>have turned the World up∣side down</HI> where-ever they have prevailed, and kept it in Wars and Confusions in some part or other, from the first entrance of Sin and Lust into the World to this Day. Lust had no sooner entered our first Parents, but <HI>Adam</HI> was for accusing his Wife<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 3. 12.</NOTE>, and doubtless a Quarrel immediately en∣sued. And the two first Sons that were born to them, were no sooner grown up, but the Spirit that lusteth to Envy, prevailed in one to such a degree that he slew his Brother<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. 4. 8.</NOTE> And oh! what Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Strifes, Wars and Fightings have, there been in the World ever since!</P>
<P>The Lusts that are in the World, and that are in a peculiar manner litigious and contentious are such as these, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Pride, Envy, Malice, Discon∣tent, Emulation, Wrath, Jealousy, Deceit, Cove∣tousness, and the like. And now if we trace up the Quarrels that are in Families and among Friends and Neighbours, the civil Discords. Tu∣mults and Animosities in particular Nations be∣tween Princes and their Subjects, and all the Re∣ligious Controversies in the Church, which have been generally carried on with as great Fierceness and Rage as any; and lastly, if we were able to traverse all the Wars that have been among the Nations and Kingdoms of the Earth, we shall find the Origin of them in some or other of the fore∣mentioned Lusts. How came it to pass that Nati∣on has been at War against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom, in the several Ages and Genera∣tions of the World; so that there has scarce ever been a universal Peace, but from Men's Lusts, at least on one side, and most commonly on both?
<PB N="14" REF="003623_0012_1002354DD259B160"/>
Indeed the Emperor <HI>Augustus,</HI> shut the Temple of <HI>Janus</HI> the third time, in Token of a universal Peace, when Christ the Prince of Peace made his entrance into the World; but whether it reached any further than the Roman Empire is uncer∣tain.</P>
<P>What is it that has brought such mighty Armies into the Field, that has covered the Face there∣of with humaine Blood, that has ravaged so many Countries, and laid so many rich and beautiful Cities waste, but the unsufferable Pride of Princes, and the insatiable Avarice, Cruelty and Blood-thirs∣tiness of their Officers and Soldiers? Whence was it that the mighty Monarch of <HI>Assyria</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> and Emperors of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> sent their vic∣torious Armies to all Kingdoms Countries and Pro∣vinces within their Knowledge, to subdue and conquer them, but from their (I had almost said) infinite Pride, grasping at an universal Monarchy, and from their Cruelty, Tyranny and Covetous∣ness, which have born down all regard to the Laws of Nations, or the natural Rights and Pro∣perties of Men? And what are we to think of many of those mighty and renowned Heroes, but as so many lawless Tyrants, who when they led their Captives in Triumph thro' their capital Ci∣ties, were themselves in a much more inglorious Manner led in Triumph by their own Lusts?</P>
<P>And then if we look into the Christian World, and among the Nations that profess Subjection to the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> and to be governed by the <HI>Gospel of Peace,</HI> we shall find they have been as often at War as other Nations, and their Wars to have taken their Rise from as base a Cause. What has been the Cause of all the dreadful Wars in <HI>Christendom,</HI> but the Pride of Princes, aiming at a greater Dominion than was their Right; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="15" REF="003623_0013_100235314D941AD0"/>
their Covetousness, wickedly desiring to be en∣riched by the Spoils of their Nei'bours; or from a jealous and envious Spirit, not bearing to see others grow greater than themselves; or from an∣gry Resentment and cruel Revenge, raging in the breasts of haughty Princes to such a degree, that nothing but the Blood and Destruction of those against whom they are incensed can satisfy? And how often have the most publick Treaties of Peace, Leagues and Alliances that have been entered in∣to, and in the most solemn Manner ratified and confirmed, been violated and broken in upon by these deceitful Lusts? So that we must all acknow∣ledge with the Apostle, <HI>That Wars and Fightings come from hence, even from Men's Lusts.</HI> They are begun by Men's Lusts on one Side, and too com∣monly carried on by them on the other. I don't say it is always so; for altho' it is hard to con∣ceive how a War should begin but from some Lust or other; yet we can see how it may be prosecuted on the other side without. For there is no doubt, but when the just Rights of a Nati∣on or People are invaded and incroached upon by a Foreign Power, they may oppose and resist e∣ven unto Blood; yea, and may prosecute the War so far against them as to recover their Rights, and take Satisfaction for the Damages sustained by the Invasions of their Enemies; provided that Satis∣faction be not offered, and cannot be obtained in a more gentle Way. Yea, and I see not why they may not proceed to weaken the Power of the Aggressor, that has often proved false and treache∣rous, so far as shall discourage from making any further Assaults upon them. But how seldom does a Nation act meerly upon such Principles, and prosecute a War with such Limitations as these? But instead hereof, have we not reason to
<PB N="16" REF="003623_0014_1002352A3B2C9328"/>
think, that even those Nations who have engag∣ed in a lawful War, would carry it on to an un∣lawful Length and Degree, even to the utter De∣struction of their Enemies, or at least to the tak∣ing away of all Government from them, and mak∣ing them a Province of their own, if God in his wise and gracious Providence did not interpose? How would Nations and Countries and Kingdoms be sacrificed to the Revenge of each other, and how would the lesser and weaker Kingdoms be swallowed up and devoured by those of superiour Strength and Numbers, if it was not for the Lord to whom the Kingdoms of the World belong, and <HI>who is the Governour among the Nations,</HI> who <HI>cau∣ses the Wrath of Man to praise him,</HI> by accom∣plishing his Purposes and Designs upon a Person or People, and then <HI>restrains the remainder of it,</HI> say∣ing to the insulting and invading Powers of the Earth, as in <HI>Job.</HI> 38. 11. <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, and here shall thy proud Waves be stayed.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed now to make some Improvement and Application of these Things. And in the</P>
<P>1st. place, <HI>What we have heard, discovers some of the evil Effects and Consequences of our first Parents suffering Sin and Lust to enter into their Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>For as the Lusts which entered into their Hearts took Possession of the human Nature, and have been propogated to all the natural Descendants of <HI>Adam,</HI> so they have been the unhappy Parents of all the Miseries and Calamities that are or have been in the World. Lust had no sooner entered the Heart of Man, but it conceived and bro't forth Sin, and a Train of innumerable Evils with it. It bro'c Curse on the Earth, and in a great measure, put the whole Frame of Nature here be∣low
<PB N="17" REF="003623_0015_100235502B788658"/>
out of Course: But in a more especial man∣ner has it disordered the human Nature, and put those Faculties among which there was a perfect Harmony, at the utmost Variance, and set every Man at war with himself. But these are not all the unhappy Effects of Men's Lusts; for they are al∣so the Seeds of Discord that are sown among Brethren, and the Cause of all the Wars and the Calamities which the World, by reason hereof, have laboured under from the beginning to this Day. Little did our first Parents think of the Disorder Confusion and Misery, which they entailed upon their Posterity, when they hearkened to the sug∣gestions of Satan, and gave way to an irregular Desire.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We learn what may be expected and look'd for in a World that is full of Sin and Lust, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Wars and Rumours of Wars continually.</HI></P>
<P>These are but the natural Effects of Pride, En∣vy, Jealousy, Malice, Covetousness, and the like; And when we see these Lusts continuing and pre∣vailing in our selves and among Mankind in gene∣ral, what can we expect but Tumults in our own Breasts, Jars in Families, Discords among Bre∣thren, Quarrels among Nei'bours, Divisions in the Church, Contentions in the State, and Wars and Fightings among the Nations? These things na∣turally follow upon Men's Lusts; and we may as well expect that Causes will cease to produce their Effects, as that these things should discontinue, while Men are inslaved to their Lusts.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The only way to solid and lasting Peace, is to curb and conquer Men's Lusts.</HI></P>
<P>There can be no way so effectual to procure and settle Peace upon a sure Foundation, as to strike at the Root of all Contentions; and what is that but the Lusts of Men? Let them be but once destroy∣ed,
<PB N="18" REF="003623_0016_100201E842A575B0"/>
and there is nothing remains to disturb within, or to stir up Wars without. Take away the Cause and the Effect ceaseth. Take away the Lusts that are in the World, and Wars would come to a per∣petual End, and our Peace will be as a River, con∣stant and never failing. Then a People would be at Peace among themselves, and their Ways being such as please the Lord, their Enemies would also be at Peace with them.</P>
<P>And this leads me to infer,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Excellency of the Gospel, and the happy Ten∣dency of its Doctrines and Precepts, to procure and establish Peace among Men.</HI></P>
<P>For the Design of the Gospel is to subdue Men's Lusts, to cleanse us from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit: <HI>The Grace of God,</HI> the Gospel, <HI>that bringeth Salvation, and that hath appeared unto us, teacheth us to deny Ungodliness and worldly Lusts;</HI> yea, and all spiritual and fleshly Lusts. And if once the Gospel had taken such powerful and universal Ef∣fect, as to root out these Lusts, then would there be, as was sung by the heavenly Host, at the coming of the <HI>Messias,</HI> and first setting up the Gospel Kingdom, <HI>Peace on Earth, and good will a∣mong Men,</HI> as well as <HI>Glory to God in the high∣est.</HI></P>
<P>And it is only because the Gospel does not reign so powerfully and universally in the Hearts of Men, as it ought, that those Prophecies of uni∣versal Peace and Tranquility to be in Gospel-Times, are not as yet accomplished. Let Men but live up to the Principles and Precepts of the Chris∣tian Dispensation, and see if it would not then be as the Prophet foretold, <HI>Isa.</HI> 2. 4. <HI>They shall beat their Swords into Plow shares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks, Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither shall they learn War any more.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="19" REF="003623_0017_10023551BA6D8500"/>
5. <HI>We learn, that Heaven must needs be a Place of perfect Peace and Quietness forever, because entirely freed from Sin and Lust.</HI></P>
<P>Heaven is a high and holy Place, into which nothing enters that defiles; and every Inhabitant being made perfect in Holiness, there can't be the least Discord or Difference among them. In∣deed those litigious Lusts of Pride and Envy did once invade those pure and peaceful Regions, when a number of Angels revolted, and a dreadful War commenced upon it; but those apostate Spirits being over-born by a superiour Power, were immediately banished those blisful Abodes, as Disturbers of their Peace, and Interrupters of their Happiness.</P>
<P>And now none can enter there, but such as are intirely cleansed from all their Lusts, and made perfect in Holiness. No Pride, no Envy, no Discontent can come within the Gates of this coelestial City, but every one that has an entrance ministred to him into this everlasting Kingdom, being thus perfectly freed from these disturbing Lusts, there must needs be an inviolable Peace and perpetual Harmony among them. <Q>Instead of looking with a contemptuous or envious Eye upon one another, they will by a sublimated Charity, delight in each others Happiness, and all rejoice in God, the Centre of their Bliss.</Q></P>
<P>But to come to some Inferrences that are more immediately to the Purposes and Designs of the present Day.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>What we have heard, may help us to judge, in a good measure, as to the Lawfulness or Unlawfulness of a War.</HI></P>
<P>For this we may lay down as a general Rule, That a War raised and prosecuted meerly by Men's Lusts, must needs be unlawful on the side of the
<PB N="20" REF="003623_0018_1002352162DE1A08"/>
Aggressor: But then the same War becomes law∣ful, and very necessary on the side of the Oppo∣ser</P>
<P>When a Prince thro' Pride, Envy or Avarice, makes unreasonable Demands upon his Nei'bour Princes, and upon their refusing to comply, pro∣ceeds in a hostile Manner to force them to it, it must needs be unlawful, contrary to the Law of God, of Nature, and the professed Rules of all civilized Nations. For the superiour Strength of one Nation gives them no more Right to invade the Properties and Priviledges of another, than one Man's being stronger than another, gives him a right to injure and abuse him. And for one Nation to encroach upon the Rights and Proper∣ties of a Nei'bour Nation, by Force and Arms, is only a more open Violence, Robbery and Mur∣ther. But then as there is no way for such a People to suppress, resist, or get Satisfaction for the Violence and Injuries offered them, but by the like Force and warlike Proceedings; so this must needs be very just and lawful, yea, and the Duty of such an injured People, provided that reasonable Terms of Peace and Satisfaction have been proposed, and a Compliance therewith re∣fused by their Adversaries. For, for one Nation to submit to be injured, invaded and run upon by another, without resisting and opposing them with their utmost Power, (when Terms of Peace have been unreasonably rejected) would argue such a Cowardice and Meaness of Spirit, that the Gospel, as much as it preaches up Peace, would reprove such a people for. For however it may direct private Christians to suffer injuries rather than revenge themselves, yet it does not for∣bid them from bringing such Offenders before the civil Magistrate to be corrected for their Wick∣edness,
<PB N="21" REF="003623_0019_100235534BFE5FA0"/>
who is declared to be the Minister of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 4. And much more necessa∣ry is it to stop the Violence, and take Satisfacti∣on for Injuries offered to a whole Nation. But as this can't be done by the civil Magistrate, because their Power is confined within their own Government, therefore there is no other Way for a Nation, as such, to defend or recover their just Rights, but by entering into a War against their Enemies, which must needs be lawful, and the Duty of an injured People, when all Capitulati∣ons prove in vain.</P>
<P>In short, a War is lawful, when it is entered into, not for the gratifying our own Lusts, but for the opposing the Lusts of others that are in∣jurious to us. A War is lawful, when it is for the necessary Defence or recovering of our just Rights. It is lawful also to enter into a War, when our Help is desired, for the necessary Pro∣tection and Relief of a People whom we see op∣pressed, and in Danger of being swallowed up by their Enemies, who have without Cause risen up against them. And I don't see why a War may not be lawful, for the opposing and suppressing the growing Power and Tyranny of any Nation, whom we behold advancing themselves, by vio∣lent and unjust Encroachments upon their Neigh∣bours, to such a degree of Power, as would over∣ballance all the Force that we could make against them. Now in these and such like Cases, (for I don't pretend to have mentioned every thing that will justify a warlike Proceeding) a People may make War, and go forth in a humble Dependance upon Almighty God to protect them, and pros∣per their just Arms against their Enemies. For a War entered into upon such Accounts as these,
<PB N="22" REF="003623_0020_100235568EEA9A80"/>
is the Cause of Justice and Mercy, and that is the Cause of God, and He will be on our Side, and if He be for us, we need not fear who is a∣gainst us.</P>
<P>But here I must observe, That it is not so much the Business of the Soldier to enquire into the Merits of the Cause, and judge whether the War be lawful or unlawful, for that is an Affair in∣trusted with the Prince and Councils of a Nati∣on; and the Soldier is to presume that the Go∣vernment have good Reasons to justify their pro∣claiming and engaging in a War: And his Busi∣ness is to be strong and couragious, and to fight manfully under his Commander, in the several Posts of Difficulty and Danger that may be assign∣ed him, without puzling his Mind with scrupe∣lous Enquiries, whether the War be lawfully enter∣ed into or not.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>What we have heard, teaches us after what Manner, and with what Views and Temper of Mind, Men should go forth to War.</HI></P>
<P>It must not be to gratify any Lust of our own, but for the resisting and opposing the un∣reasonable Lusts of others. It must not be to injure and oppress others, or to invade any of their just Rights, but from a generous Concern for the Defence and Safety of our own: Not meerly to hurt and destroy them, from any cruel and savage Disposition whithin us, but for own Secu∣rity.</P>
<P>In short, the Glory of God, the Interest of Re∣ligion, and the Safety of his People, must lie nearest the Soldier's Heart; and a Zeal for these Things must fill the Christian Soldier with hero∣ick Courage and Fortitude of Mind, ready to sacrifice his Life and Fortunes for the publick Safety, if called to it. Then, and only then, can
<PB N="23" REF="003623_0021_1002353C74A3C0F8"/>
he on good Ground expect that God will be a Shield and Buckler to him. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>What we have heard, highly recommends Mi∣litary Skill and Courage as absolutely necessary, under God, for the Defence and Safety of a People.</HI></P>
<P>For considering our own Lusts, and the Lusts of others, we must look for Wars and Fightings. Our own Lusts are such as may provoke God to stir up our Enemies against us. We are also in danger by our Lusts of abusing and injuring our Nei'bouring Tribes and Nations, and thereby of stirring up their Corruptions to come in a way of Revenge upon us: Or if we should by our just and honest Dealings with them, escape the Guilt of bringing a War upon our selves; yet their Lusts without any Provocation of ours, may break out against us. So that considering the Lusts of Men, it is impossible for us to be assured of the Con∣tinuance of Peace.</P>
<P>And therefore it must needs be the Wisdom of every People to be so aware of the various Lusts of Men, and the Manner of their Oppera∣tions, as to put and always keep themselves in proper Postures of Defence; not only by keep∣ing up Forts and Castles, and such like Strong Holds in good Repair, but by having a suitable Number of skilful and valiant Soldiers, Men that understand the Art of War, and have Courage to appear in the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>Altho' Men's Lusts are the Cause of War, yet military Skill and Courage are from a nobler Prin∣ciple, and are not only consistent with, but are very much improved and heightened by true Grace. And my Text, altho' it disparages War in general, considering its Original, yet by Consequence it countenances a warlike Genius: For considering the Tendency of Men's Lusts, there must needs
<PB N="24" REF="003623_0022_10023540596CD9A0"/>
be Wars and Fightings; and what is the natural Consequence of this, but that the Art of War is highly useful and necessary, to defend us against the Violence of Men's Lusts?</P>
<P>Here therefore let me address my self to the <HI>Honourable Company of the ARTILLERT,</HI> and say, That your Designs and Endeavours to be thorough∣ly skill'd in the Art of War, is very Laudable and Praise worthy. For considering the Lusts and Corruptions of Men prevail after such a manner, it is become as necessary an Art as any: And it is the Wisdom and Duty of a People to cultivate and improve it.</P>
<P>It shows what a proper Tho't and Apprehension of these Things our Fore Fathers had, when they established such a Company as this, and encouraged it with certain Privileges and Immunities. It show'd that they were well aware of the Lusts of Men, and apprehensive in Consequence hereof, what frequent Occasions there would be for Men expert in War.</P>
<P>And it is with Pleasure that we now behold this Company increasing, and more of a military Spirit discovering it self, by the very considerable Additions which have been made of late to this Seminary or School for the martial Art. And what is further to be desired is, that this honou∣rable Company might still advance in Reputation, and be of more extensive Benefit, by the coming in of those that sustain the higher Commissions in the military Order, such as the Field-Officers in the several Regiments, who by attending these stated Exercises a few Times in a Year, would be able to propagate this useful Art to their Subal∣terns, and they to their several Companies; and so the whole Militia of the Land might be gloried of,
<PB N="25" REF="003623_0023_1002352C944FA178"/>
as those of the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> in I <HI>Chron.</HI> 12. 30, 33. That <HI>were Men of Valour, expert in War, that could keep Rank, and were not of a double Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Blessed be God! We have not had Occasion for such disciplined Soldiers as these of late, by reason of the happy Peace we have had for several Years, and do still enjoy. But we may not expect a long and uninterrupted Series of it; for we may just∣ly fear that either our own Lusts, or the Lusts of others, will break forth and disturb our pre∣sent Tranquility. It is necessary therefore that we should be always ready, even for a sudden Attack: Improve your opportunities therefore in gaining all the Skill, Courage and Conduct that is needfull; for you know not how soon there may be Occasion for you to go forth and employ the same, in the Service of God and your Coun∣try.</P>
<P>We know not what Designs are forming against us. That we are hated by some, and envied by others for our growing greatness, is not to be doubted. And how soon their Lusts may rise to such a Head, as to break out against us in an o∣pen War, and how soon God shall see cause to correct us with such a Judgment, is known only to Him. And as for the reviving military Skill, if it should forebode the Approach of War; yet it affords a happy Omen that we shall not be giv∣en as a prey to our Enemies: but rather by these Means God will defend us from our Enemies, and make use of our Skill to defeat their Designs, and cause them to turn back ashamed.</P>
<P>But alass! to what Purpose is it to have Offi∣cers and Soldiers expert it War, and valiant in Battle, and at the same Time to have our Cas∣tles and Batteries, our Forts and Garrisons, neg∣lected and suffered to fall to the Ground? Sure∣ly
<PB N="26" REF="003623_0024_10023542ADFB7430"/>
upon these Accounts we are in a very defence∣less Posture, and too much resemble <HI>a City with∣out Gates and Bars,</HI> yea, a <HI>City broken down, and without Walls.</HI> The decaying State of our For∣tifications, looks as if we were not aware of the Lusts of Men, and thought all Danger of their breaking out against us was over, and as if the glorious Times were come, when the Nations would learn War no more. But how groundless are such Expectations? The Lusts of Men pre∣vail as much as ever, and our growing greatness naturally excites their Jealousies and their Envy, and our growing wickedness as certainly stirs up the fierce Wrath of the Almighty, that gives us reason to fear He will withdraw His Restraints from them. And what a miserable Defence should we be able to make against a Foreign Invasion, under our present Circumstances! I don't pre∣sume to tax the Government in any Branch of it; but would only observe how unhappy it is, that they can't unite in Measures for their ne∣cessary Defence. For how can we expect the di∣vine Protection, when we can't agree upon Me∣thods proper for our own Safety? It is only when a People's ways please the Lord, and they are united among themselves, and take all prudent Methods for their own Security, that they may expect God to be their <HI>Fortress and their Munition of Rocks.</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude,</P>
<P><HI>Whilst we, thro' the Favour of God, enjoy an out∣ward Peace, let us not be insensible of that dreadful War that is within, stirred up by our Lusts, that are warring in our Members.</HI> And now let us manage this War with our Lusts, and all our Spiritual Enemies, with the Skill, Resolution and Courage, that becomes wise and good Soldiers under Jesus
<PB N="27" REF="003623_0025_100235392AA9C0C0"/>
Christ, the great <HI>Commander of his People, and Captain of our Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>There can be no Dispute about the Lawfulness of carry∣ing on this War: For it is absolutely necessary, and our in∣dispensable Duty. There can never be a Peace made with these Enemies but a very inglorious one: Nay, by the least Concessions, or so much as Capitulations with them, we forfeit our Honour.</P>
<P>Whatever Possession they have gotten of us, it is by Re∣bellion and Usurpation, and none of these wicked Lusts have a right to live in us: We must therefore fight 'till we are the Death of every one of them. It is not enough to weaken and destroy the Power of some, for they are so interwoven and united together; and such is their myste∣rious Nature, that if one Lust be left alive and let alone, it will quickly give Life again to all the rest, and they will rise up against us an exceeding great Army. The Temper therefore of these Enemies is such as wont allow us to give Quarter, or shew any Mercy; for Mercy to them is Cruelty and Death to our selves. There must be no Trea∣ties, no Truces or Cessation of Arms, for the least Indul∣gence granted to them, will only give them an Advantage against us. We must therefore be always upon our Watch and Guard; nay, we must be actually resisting and oppo∣sing of them with all our Might, and then we shall find that we don't fight as those that beat the Air. For we shall after many a violent Struggle and sharp Conflict, at length gain the Victory, and come off Conquerers, yea, more than Conquerers thro' Christ that has loved us, and given himself for us, to redeem us from all Iniquity. And ha∣ving thus overcome <HI>thro' the Blood of the Lamb,</HI> we shall with Him and holy Angels that have been attending on Him, make our triumphant Progress to the Coelestial City, and being welcomed with loud Hosannas, shall be crown'd as Victors with immortal Honours. And having thus end∣ed the Toils and Fatigues of War, we shall in everlast∣ing Peace sit down with Christ on his Throne, <HI>even as he has overcome, and is set down with his Father on his Throne.</HI></P>
