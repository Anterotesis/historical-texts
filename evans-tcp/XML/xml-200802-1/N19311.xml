<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>—I may assert eternal Providence,</L>
<L>And justify the ways of God to man.</L>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>FAR in a wild, unknown to publick view,</L>
<L>From youth to age a rev'rend Hermit grew;</L>
<L>The moss his bed—the cave his hum∣ble cell,</L>
<L>His food the fruits, his drink the crys∣tal well.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="025149_0007_0FCE6E9581CA5020"/>Remote from man, with God he pass'd his days,</L>
<L>Prayer all his business, all his pleasure praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A life so sacred, such serene repose,</L>
<L>Seem'd heav'n itself, till one suggestion rose;</L>
<L>That vice should triumph, virtue vice obey;</L>
<L>This sprung some doubt of Provi∣dence's sway.</L>
<L>His hopes no more a certain prospect boast,</L>
<L>And all the tenor of his soul is lost.</L>
<L>So when a smooth expanse receives impress'd</L>
<L>Calm Nature's image on its wat'ry breast,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="025149_0008_0FCE6E9704138C70"/>Down bend the banks, the trees im∣pending grow,</L>
<L>And skies beneath with answering col∣ours glow.</L>
<L>But if a stone the gentle sea divide,</L>
<L>Swift ruffling circles curl on ev'ry side;</L>
<L>And glimm'ring fragments of a broken sun;</L>
<L>Banks, trees, and skies in thick disor∣der run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To clear this doubt, to know the world by sight,</L>
<L>To find if books or swains report it right,</L>
<L>(For yet by swains alone the world he knew,</L>
<L>Whose feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly dew)</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="025149_0009_0FCE6E986EA41428"/>He quits his cell; the pilgrim's staff he bore,</L>
<L>And fix'd the scallop in his hat before;</L>
<L>Then with the sun a rising journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each event.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morn was wasted in the path∣less grass,</L>
<L>And long and lonesome was the wild to pass:</L>
<L>But when the southern sun had warm'd the day,</L>
<L>A youth came posting o'er a crossing way;</L>
<L>His raiment decent, his complexion fair,</L>
<L>And soft in graceful ringlets wav'd his hair.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="025149_0010_0FCE6E9A8248AFB0"/>Then near approaching, Father, hail! he cry'd;</L>
<L>And hail, my son! the rev'rend sire reply'd;</L>
<L>Words follow'd words, from question answer flow'd,</L>
<L>And talk of various kinds deceiv'd the road;</L>
<L>Till each with other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their age they differ, join in heart.</L>
<L>Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound,</L>
<L>Thus youthful ivy clasps an elm a∣round.—</L>
<L>But here the youth enjoin'd the eager sire,</L>
<L>Who into hidden truths did much in∣quire,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="025149_0011_0FCE6E9B6F98CC98"/>If he'd in silence each event behold,</L>
<L>He wou'd to him some wond'rous things unfold.</L>
<L>Now sunk the sun—closing hour of day</L>
<L>Came onward, mantled o'er with sober grey;</L>
<L>Nature in silence bid the world repose;</L>
<L>When near the road a stately palace rose:</L>
<L>There by the moon, thro' ranks of trees they pass,</L>
<L>Whose verdure crown'd their sloping sides of grass.</L>
<L>It chanc'd, the noble master of the dome</L>
<L>Still made his house the wand'ring stranger's home.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="025149_0012_0FCE6E9DB4D77358"/>Yet still his kindness, from a thirst of praise,</L>
<L>Prov'd the vain flourish of expensive ease.</L>
<L>The pair arrive, the livery'd servants wait;</L>
<L>Their lord receives them at the pomp∣ous gate;</L>
<L>The table groans with costly piles of food,</L>
<L>And all is more than hospitably good.</L>
<L>Then led to rest, the day's long toil they drown,</L>
<L>Deep sunk in sleep, and silk, and heaps of down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length 'tis morn▪ and at the dawn of day</L>
<L>Along the wide canals the zephyrs play;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="025149_0013_0FCE6E9FF576B4E0"/>Fresh o'er the gay parterres the breezes creep,</L>
<L>And shake the neighbouring wood to banish sleep.</L>
<L>Up rise the guests, obedient to the call;</L>
<L>An early banquet deck'd the splendid hall;</L>
<L>Rich, luscious wine a golden goblet grac'd,</L>
<L>Which the kind master forc'd his guests to taste:</L>
<L>Then pleas'd and thankful from the porch they go,</L>
<L>And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe;</L>
<L>His cup was vanish'd; for in secret guise</L>
<L>The younger guest purloin'd the glit∣tering prize.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="025149_0014_0FCE6EA230CAB130"/>Now on they pass—when far upon the road,</L>
<L>The wealthy spoil the wily partner shew'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As one who spies a serpent in his way</L>
<L>Glist'ning and basking in the summer ray,</L>
<L>Disorder'd stops, to shun the danger near,</L>
<L>Then walks with faintness on, and looks with fear:</L>
<L>So seem'd the sire, he walk'd with trembling heart:</L>
<L>And much he wish'd, but durst not ask to part:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On account of the promise at first setting out.</NOTE></L>
<L>Murm'ring, he lifts his eyes, and thinks it hard,</L>
<L>That gen'rous actions meet a base reward.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="025149_0015_0FCE6EA71870BAA8"/>While thus they pass, the sun his glory shrouds,</L>
<L>The changing skies hang out their sable clouds;</L>
<L>A sound in air presag'd approaching rain,</L>
<L>And beasts to coverts scud across the plain.</L>
<L>Warn'd by the signs, the wand'ring pair retreat,</L>
<L>To seek for shelter at a neighb'ring seat:</L>
<L>'Twas built with turrets on a rising ground,</L>
<L>And strong, and large, and unimprov'd around:</L>
<L>Its owner's temper, tim'rous and severe,</L>
<L>Unkind and griping, caus'd a desart there.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="025149_0016_0FCE6EA8C5E4B678"/>As near the miser's heavy door they drew,</L>
<L>Fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew;</L>
<L>The nimble lightning mix'd with show'rs began,</L>
<L>And o'er their heads loud rolling thunder ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the wind, and batter'd by the rain.</L>
<L>At length some pity warm'd the mas∣ter's breast:</L>
<L>('Twas then his threshold first receiv'd a guest.)</L>
<L>Slow creaking turns the door with jealous care,</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the shiv'ring pair;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="025149_0017_0FCE6EA9D85896F8"/>One frugal faggot lights the naked walls,</L>
<L>And Nature's fervour through their limbs recals:</L>
<L>Bread of the coarsest sort, with mea∣gre wine,</L>
<L>Each hardly granted, serv'd them both to dine;</L>
<L>And when the tempest first appear'd to cease,</L>
<L>A ready warning bid them part in peace.</L>
<L>With still remark the pondering Hermit view'd,</L>
<L>In one so rich, a life so poor and rude;</L>
<L>And, Why should such, within him∣self he cry'd,</L>
<L>Lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside?</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="025149_0018_0FCE6EAB92D49650"/>But what new marks of wonder soon took place</L>
<L>In every setting feature of his face!</L>
<L>When, from his vest, the young com∣panion bore</L>
<L>That cup the generous landlord own'd before;</L>
<L>And paid profusely, with the precious bowl,</L>
<L>The stinted kindness of his churlish soul:</L>
<L>Just sunk to earth, the miser in sur∣prise,</L>
<L>Receiv'd the glitt'ring gift with startled eyes;</L>
<L>But 'ere he could recover from his fright,</L>
<L>The generous guests had travelled from his sight.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="025149_0019_0FCE6EACB4113940"/>Now the brisk clouds in airy tu∣mults fly,</L>
<L>The sun emerging opes an azure sky;</L>
<L>A fresher green the fragrant leaves display,</L>
<L>And glitt'ring as they tremble, cheer the day,</L>
<L>While hence they walk, the pilgrim's bosom wrought</L>
<L>With all the travail of uncertain thought;</L>
<L>His partner's acts without their <HI>cause</HI> appear,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To steal the cup from the generous man, and give it to a wretch that would scarce admit them within his gate.</NOTE></L>
<L>'Twas there a vice, but seem'd a mad∣ness here.</L>
<L>Detesting that, and pitying this, he goes,</L>
<L>Lost and confounded with the various shows.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="025149_0020_0FCE6EAEE4769C28"/>Now Night's dim shades again in∣volve the sky,</L>
<L>Again the wand'rers want a place to lie,</L>
<L>Again they search, and find a man∣sion nigh.</L>
<L>The soil improv'd around, the man∣sion neat,</L>
<L>And neither poorly low, nor idly great:</L>
<L>It seem'd to speak its master's turn of mind,</L>
<L>Content, and not for praise but vir∣tue, kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither the walkers turn their weary feet,</L>
<L>Then bless the mansion, and the mas∣ter greet;</L>
<L>Their greeting fair, bestow'd with modest guise,</L>
<L>The courteous master hears, and thus replies:</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="025149_0021_0FCE6EB0725A7CD8"/>Without a vain, without a grudging heart,</L>
<L>To him who gives us all, I yield a part:</L>
<L>From him you come, from him ac∣cept it here,</L>
<L>A frank and sober, more than costly cheer.</L>
<L>He spoke, and bid the welcome table spread,</L>
<L>Then talk'd of virtue till the time of bed;</L>
<L>When the grave household round the hall repair,</L>
<L>Warn'd by a bell, and close the hour with prayer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length the world, renew'd by calm repose,</L>
<L>Was strong for toil, the dapple morn arose;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="025149_0022_0FCE6EB3CC2E1290"/>Before the pilgrims part, the younger crept</L>
<L>Near the clos'd cradle, where an in∣fant slept,</L>
<L>And writh'd his neck; the landlord's little pride,</L>
<L>O strange return! grew black, and gasp'd, and dy'd.</L>
<L>Horror of horrors! What! his only son?</L>
<L>How look'd our Hermit when the fact was done?</L>
<L>Not hell, tho' hell's black jaws in sun∣der part,</L>
<L>And breathe blue fire, could more as∣sail his heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Confus'd and struck with silence at the deed,</L>
<L>He flies—but trembling, fails to fly with speed.</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="025149_0023_0FCE6EB4EFC7C7F0"/>His steps the youth pursues; the coun∣try lay</L>
<L>Perplex'd with roads, a servant shew'd the way;</L>
<L>A river cross'd the path; the passage o'er</L>
<L>Was nice to find, the servant went be∣fore;</L>
<L>Long arms of oak an open bridge sup∣ply'd,</L>
<L>And deep the waves beneath them bending glide:</L>
<L>The youth, who seem'd to watch a time to sin.</L>
<L>Approach'd the careless guide, and thrust him in:</L>
<L>Plunging he falls, and rising lifts his head,</L>
<L>Then flashing turns, and sinks among the dead.</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="025149_0024_0FCE6EBA064DFF98"/>Wild sparkling rage inflames the Hermit's eyes,</L>
<L>He bursts the bands of fear, and mad∣ly cries,</L>
<L>Detested wretch!—But scarce his speech began</L>
<L>When the strange partner seem'd no longer man;</L>
<L>His youthful face grew more serenely sweet,</L>
<L>His robes turn'd white, and flow'd about his feet:</L>
<L>Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair;</L>
<L>Celestial odours breathe thro' purpled air;</L>
<L>And wings, whose colours glitter'd like the day,</L>
<L>Wide at his back the dazzling plumes display.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="025149_0025_0FCE6EBAFAA5AFE8"/>The form etherial bursts upon his sight,</L>
<L>And moves in all the majesty of light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' loud at first the pilgrim's pas∣sion grew;</L>
<L>Sudden he gaz'd, and wist not what to do:</L>
<L>Surprise in secret chains his words suspends,</L>
<L>And in a calm his settling temper ends.</L>
<L>But silence here the beauteous angel broke,</L>
<L>The voice of musick ravish'd as he spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy prayer, thy praise, thy life to vice unknown,</L>
<L>In sweet memorial rise before the throne;</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="025149_0026_0FCE6EBCE25A6730"/>These charms success in our bright region find,</L>
<L>And force an angel down to calm thy mind;</L>
<L>For this commission'd, I forsook the sky;</L>
<L>Nay, cease to kneel—thy fellow ser∣vant, I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then know the truth of govern∣ment divine,</L>
<L>And let the scruples be no longer thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The master justly claims that world he made;</L>
<L>In this the right of Providence is laid;</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="025149_0027_0FCE6EBEC97F1B48"/>Its sacred majesty through all depends,</L>
<L>On using second means<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Second means—God often appoints wicked and abandoned wretches to be his instruments of justice up∣on others, for some ends tending to publick good, though unperceived by human eyes.</NOTE> to work his ends:</L>
<L>'Tis thus, withdrawn in state from human eye,</L>
<L>The power exerts its attributes on high:</L>
<L>Your actions uses, nor controls your will,</L>
<L>And bids the doubting sons of men be still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What strange events can strike with more surprise</L>
<L>Than those which lately struck thy wand'ring eyes?</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="025149_0028_0FCE6EC125806338"/>Yet taught by these, confess th' Al∣mighty just,</L>
<L>And, where you can't unriddle, learn to trust!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The great vain man, who far'd on costly food,</L>
<L>Whose life was too luxurious to be good:</L>
<L>Who made his iv'ry stands with gob∣lets shine,</L>
<L>And forc'd his guests to morning draughts of wine,</L>
<L>Has with the cup, the graceless cus∣tom lost,</L>
<L>And still he welcomes, but with less of cost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mean suspicious wretch, whose bolted door</L>
<L>Ne'er mov'd in pity to the wand'ring poor;</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="025149_0029_0FCE6EC30F1A9F78"/>With him I left the cup, to teach his mind</L>
<L>That heav'n can bless, if mortals will be kind;</L>
<L>Conscious of wanting worth, he views the bowl,</L>
<L>And feels compassion touch his grate∣ful soul.</L>
<L>Thus artists melt the sullen oar of lead,</L>
<L>With heaping coals of fire upon its head;</L>
<L>In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow,</L>
<L>And loose from dross the silver runs below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long had our pious friend in vir∣tue trod,</L>
<L>But now the child half wean'd his soul from God;</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="025149_0030_0FCE6EC571630930"/>Child of his age<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Child of his age—A child born to him when in years, on which he doated too fondly.</NOTE>, for him he liv'd in pain,</L>
<L>And measur'd back his steps to earth again.</L>
<L>To what excesses had his dotage run!</L>
<L>But God, to save the father, took the son.</L>
<L>To all but thee, in fits he seem'd to go,</L>
<L>And 'twas my ministry to deal the blow.</L>
<L>The poor fond parent, humbled in the dust,</L>
<L>Now owns in tears the punishment was just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But how had all his fortune felt a wreck,</L>
<L>Had the false servant sped in safety back?</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="025149_0031_0FCE6EC874BFF7A0"/>This very night, by secret plot con∣triv'd,</L>
<L>Of life and wealth his master he'd depriv'd;</L>
<L>Had he in this conspiracy prevail'd,</L>
<L>What funds of charity would then have fail'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus heav'n instructs thy mind: this trial o'er,</L>
<L>Depart in peace, resign, and sin no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On sounding pinions here the youth withdrew,</L>
<L>The sage stood wond'ring as the ser∣aph flew.</L>
<L>Thus look'd <HI>Elisha,</HI> when to mount on high,</L>
<L>His master took the chariot of the sky:</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="025149_0032_0FCE6ECE4A8E35A0"/>The fiery pomp ascending, left the view;</L>
<L>The prophet gaz'd, and wish'd to fol∣low too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bending Hermit here a prayer begun,</L>
<L>"Lord! as in heav'n, on earth thy will be done."</L>
<L>Then gladly turning, sought his an∣cient place,</L>
<L>And spent a life of piety and peace.</L>

<L>THE curfew tolls the knell of part∣ing day,</L>
<L>The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,</L>
<L>The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,</L>
<L>And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="025149_0036_0FCE6ED796BBCB30"/>Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,</L>

<LG>
<L>Save that, from yonder ivy mantled tow'r,</L>

<L>SWEET Auburn! lovliest village of the plain,</L>
<L>Where health and plenty cheer'd the labouring swain,</L>
<L>Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,</L>
<L>And parting summer's ling'ring blooms delay'd;</L>
<L>Dear lovely bow'rs of innocence and ease,</L>
<L>Seats of my youth, when ev'ry sport could please,</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="025149_0126_0FCE6F90950A9CA8"/>How often have I loiter'd o'er thy green,</L>
<L>Where humble happiness endear'd each scene!</L>
<L>How often have I paus'd on ev'ry charm,</L>
<L>The shelter'd cot, the cultivated farm,</L>
<L>The never failing brook, the busy mill,</L>
<L>The decent church, that topp'd the neighbouring hill,</L>
<L>The hawthorn bush, with seats be∣neath the shade,</L>
<L>For talking age and whisp'ring lovers made!</L>
<L>How often have I bless'd the coming day,</L>
<L>When toil remitting lent its turn to play.</L>
<L>And all the village train from labour free,</L>
<L>Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree,</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="025149_0127_0FCE6F9181C402D8"/>While many a pastime circle in the shade,</L>
<L>The young contending as the old sur∣vey'd;</L>
<L>And many a gambol frolick'd o'er the ground,</L>
<L>And sleights of art and seats of strength went round!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And still as each repeated pleasure tir'd,</L>
<L>Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspir'd;</L>
<L>The dancing pair that simply sought renown,</L>
<L>By holding out to tire each other down;</L>
<L>The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,</L>

<L>Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,</L>

<L>Along thy glades, a solitary guest,</L>
<L>The hollow sounding bittern guards its nest;</L>
<L>Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing slies,</L>
<L>And tires their echoes with unvaried cries.</L>
<L>Sunk are thy bow'rs in shapeless ruin all,</L>

<L>Princes and Lords may flourish, or may fade;</L>
<L>A breath can make them, as a breath has made:</L>
<L>But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</L>
<L>When once destroy'd, can never be supply'd.</L>

<LG>
<L>But times are alter'd: trade's un∣feeling train</L>

<L>And, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,</L>

<L>But now the sounds of population fail,</L>
<L>No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,</L>
<L>No busy steps the grass grown foot∣way tread,</L>
<L>But all the bloomy flush of life is fled!</L>
<L>All but yon widow'd solitary thing,</L>

<HEAD>FUTURITY.</HEAD>
<P>[Mr. Dodd was an eminent Minister of the Gospel in England, but not taking that care of his worldly affairs which was necessary, he involved himself in debt, and to extricate himself therefrom, he committed a forgery, for which he was executed in June 1777. 30,000 persons signed a petition to the King, to save his life; but it was ineffectual.</P>

<L>—DREAD GOD</L>
<L>Of justice and of mercy! Wilt <HI>Thou</HI> too,</L>
<L>In fearful Indignation on my soul,</L>
<L>My anguish'd soul, the door of pity close,</L>
<L>And shut me from Thee ever?—Lo! in dust,</L>
<L>Humiliant, prostrate, weeping 'fore thy throne—</L>

<L>Friend of repentant sinners, I confess,</L>
<L>And mourn my deep transgressions; as the sand</L>
<L>Innumerous, as the glowing crimson red:</L>
<L>With every aggravation, every guilt</L>
<L>Accumulate and burden'd! Against light,</L>

<L>Ingratitude to THEE; whose favour∣ing love</L>

<L>O'erwhelm'd with self conviction, with dismay,</L>
<L>With anguish and confusion past com∣pare!</L>
<L>And could I weep whole seas of briny tears</L>
<L>In painful penitence; could I deplore</L>
<L>From my heart's aching fountain, drop by drop,</L>
<L>My crimes and follies; my deep grief and shame,</L>
