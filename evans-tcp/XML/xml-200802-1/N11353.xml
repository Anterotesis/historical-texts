<P>EVERY intelligent reader, will be very sensible, that in handling subjects of this nature—<HI>Time</HI> to plan and digest the subject, and care to express with spirit, and yet with decent propriety are requisite; especially in times like ours.—The author, sensible of his own inequality to a per∣formance of this kind, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving but four days allowed him for the composition, and that amidst a variety of avo∣cations: Has felt exquisitely, while writing and delivering the ensuing sentiments.

These considerations will intitle him to the candour o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> friends to their country; but, from those of a different character, he is sensible he cannot expect equal fa∣vour.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>That passage of Inspiration, which I take for the motto of this Discourse, is in the Book of</HI> Esther, <HI>Chap. viii. Ver. 11.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wherein the King granted the Jews which <HI>were</HI> in every city, to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to stay, and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>UCH is the accursed nature of lawless ambi∣tion, that the greatest misfortunes of kingdoms, and states, as well as of lesser communities, and individuals, have arisen from, and are owing to an insatiate lust of power in me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of abilities, and influence.</P>
<P>Voracious like the grave, they can never have enough, <HI>i. e.</HI> of power and wealth: And are therefore prompted on by restless desires, to seek the means of accumulating these, and that by expedients, however profitable to themselves, are de∣structive to their country.</P>
<P>Such false, designing, and detestable patriots have in every age, nation, and country in the world, at one time or other, led their blind confiding country-men, into the very jaws of slavery, vassalage, and ruin.</P>
<P>The lust of power has in all nations, combined the worst passions of the human heart, and the worst projects of the human mind, in league against the liberties of mankind.—
<PB N="6" REF="014352_0004_0F91ED17493423E0"/>
From hence, has arisen so many absolute monarchies in the world, that have considered and treated their subjects, as then ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le; that have reduced thousands and millions, to a brutal vassalage, unworthy the rational and immortal nature of man; to gratify the insatiable ambition, and luxury of a crafty designing few.</P>
<P>Yea, such often, has been the influence, of a combined in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o of courtiers and state-jobbers, that the reigning mo∣narch, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh naturally of a compassionate and benevolent h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt, has been by such instruments, brought into a state of <HI>magnificent servitude,</HI> and <HI>sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended vassalage</HI>; and made ac∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ary to the blackest desings.</P>
<P>It is always the policy of such court-locusts, if possible, to shut fall the eyes, and to seal up the understanding of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e prince, both with respect to <HI>his</HI> interest and danger; the lat∣ter of which, consists in court favourites, growing too pow∣erful, and the former in the hearty love and good will, of a numerous, brave and free people.</P>
<P>These designing men, this kind of patriots, always lay their plan with a view, to sculk behind the king's authority; if <HI>their</HI> oppression rouses the nation to assert their right, to screen them from deserved vengeance; or if their sovereign's eyes should be opened to discover <HI>their</HI> black designs, and his own, and the nations true interest, and his ears to better councils, to depose, or destroy him.—In a word, if they see they are like to be cash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and the plunder of mank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d wrested from their unrighteous hands, and he will not give them his authority, to suck the blood and treasure of their fellow-subjects, they aim that his own shall pay for it.</P>
<P>But an holy, and omnipotent GOD, in his righteous provi∣dence, often disappoints these aspiring tyrants, these plagues of mankind, these pes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to all society; and causes them to be taken in their own craftiness.</P>
<P>A very striking instance of this we have in the history of this bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k.—The sacred story concerning <HI>Ahas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erus</HI> a <HI>Persian</HI> king, potent in arms, great in extent of territoty, mighty in wealth and power,—and <HI>Haman</HI> his haughty prime-minister, —and
<PB N="7" REF="014352_0005_0F91ED180942D980"/>
his ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o of court parasites,—their influence upon the king, in obtaining from him that horrid decree to slaughter the Jews in all the provinces,—the disappointment of the scheme, —the manner how,—and the remarkable interposition of di∣ivine providence therein,—is worthy our no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice and will afford us matter of instruction suitable to the present occasion.</P>
<P>This king <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> appears to be the same with <HI>Darius Hysta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pes,</HI> according to the best, and most ancient historians. And indeed, the subject of this piece of history appears to be soon after the union of the <HI>Babylonish,</HI> with the <HI>Persian</HI> em∣pire. This agrees, best with the reign of the before mention∣ed prince: For at this time the empire covered the greatest part of <HI>Asia,</HI> both the <HI>Indias, Ethiopia,</HI> and most of <HI>Africa.</HI> The kingdom now was in its zenith of greatness and glory— besides, <HI>Heredotus</HI> an ancient and good historian, observes of this prince that his Queen's name was <HI>Harossa,</HI> which, is the same with <HI>Haddassab,</HI> the <HI>Hebrew</HI> name of <HI>Esther</HI>; the same historian observes, as also <HI>Xen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phon</HI> in his life of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that the character of this king was mild and gentle, benevolent and vastly liberal, and greatly disposed to make his subjects happy; but his foibles were, an unbounded ambition, and a great propensity to luxury and sensuality.</P>
<P>As this monarchy had gained the summit of its glory, ex∣tent and wealth, it was now at peace with its neighbours a∣broad, yet luxury and riot began to rage within. It now be∣came prolifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the production of cockatrices and vip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, that began to prey upon the bowels of the empire. It was with this kingdom, just as it is now, and always has been, with states under like circumstances.</P>
<P>Political bodies resemble the human; they have their birth, their youth, their manhood or full strength, their decline, their old age, <HI>infirmities</HI> and death. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it was with <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> and other kingdoms; so it will be with the <HI>British,</HI> and every other kingdom and state in the world.— As it is with the human body, when every joint, ligament, muscle and fibre h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—e come to their full strength, and maturity, it stays not long in that state, it is then fixed for the seizure of disease, for gradual decline; it is weakened by impercept<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble strokes, <HI>until disease rages and death ensues.</HI> The first strokes that a
<PB N="8" REF="014352_0006_0F91ED18C91FB180"/>
state, or political body receives, after its arrival to the sum∣mit of its glory and strength; is usually from the venality and rapine, of its over-grown members: Under the covert of law, and shew of justice.—When a state, by the influence of minions, and court parasites, those blood-suckers of the con∣stitution, begins, and goes on, to establish unrighteousness by law;—and legislative authority is prostituted, to the iniquitous, and low purpose of aggrandizing individuals, instead of the good of the whole, then it receives a mortal blow; of which wound it will certainly perish, unless timely healed.—For one set of humours will flow in after another, till the juices of the political body are consumed—and death is the conse∣quence: Chicanery and craft, will be played backward, and forward, by designing and ambitious men, for places of pro∣fit and honour, until the wealth of a <HI>kingdom</HI> is exhausted, until its strength is at first weakned, then destroyed, as with a deluge—and poverty and misery come upon its honest indus∣trious inhabitants, like the breaking in of mighty waters. If old Harpies, are ousted, the public gets nothing by the change; a new set of the same character and conduct suc∣ceed, ut unda supervenit undam; as in a rolling sea, wave urges wave; until convulsions shake the state, it to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters, and then falls. To accomplish this dreadful havock of their spe∣cies, STATE JOBBERS practice upon the <HI>imb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cilities</HI> of princes, sometimes upon the best: (For all men have their weaknesses and foibles, and happy is the man that has the fewest of them.) These, find the blind side of their prince, they court him, not to his own safety, they flatter him not to the advantage of his subjects; but <HI>their</HI> own: Which by the way is <HI>never</HI> consist∣ent with the true interest of the prince, or prosperity and happiness of his subjects. For a great part of the wealth of a state, must in this case, fall a prey to their insatiable avarice.</P>
<P>Thus did the <HI>prime minister</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> empire, that makes such a <HI>figure</HI> in the sacred history now under conside∣ration. He flattered his credulous and ambitious prince, that he was something more than human—till he really made him something less—till he caused him counter to his natural dis∣position—to conduct with savage cruelty, in that bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dy edict obtained against the innocent Jews;</P>
<P>HAMAN that arch-courtier, was ambitious like his master, but without his benevolence and good nature; yet subtle
<PB N="9" REF="014352_0007_0F91ED198921BCF0"/>
and crafty to compass his <HI>black</HI> designs—he, (as Xenophon observes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xenopo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> life of Cyrus.</NOTE>) places his master among the Gods, that he might be <HI>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed himself</HI>; and the sacred text intimates as much.— For no doubt this is the homage that <HI>Mordecai</HI> refuse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him.</P>
<P>It is very unlikely that a royal <HI>decree</HI> should be necessary to procure civil respect, to the prime <HI>minister,</HI> and so great a court favourite; and it is as unlikely that a man of <HI>Morde∣cai's</HI> good sense and piety, would deny it to him—but the HOMAGE that was decreed him, no doubt was that of <HI>worship.</HI> This, a croud of <HI>fawning, expecting, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ringing</HI> SYCO∣PHANTS <HI>paid him</HI>; but <HI>Mordecai</HI> bowed not. He that could obtain this from his duped prince, might get any thing.</P>
<P>And, now behold! His haughty heart lifted him up!— How it dilates with pride!—But, Oh! mortifying sight <HI>Mor∣de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ai</HI> denies him homage. <HI>Mordecai</HI> was a <HI>Jew,</HI> and had learned that divine lesson, <HI>thou shalt worship the Lord</HI> JE∣HOVAH, <HI>and him only shalt thou serve.</HI> And <HI>Haman</HI> an <HI>Ama∣le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite,</HI> of the royal seed of AGAG, whom the Lord had bid∣den them to abhor, and <HI>detest.</HI> And no wonder, that he, with firmness refuses the demanded <HI>homage</HI>: For <HI>this,</HI> the haughty minister determined his ruin.</P>
<P>But it was too small a thing with this PREMIER, to rise up against a single man and take away his life; this was be∣low his supposed <HI>dignity</HI>—this was too little a sacrifice to his vanity this would not sufficiently gratify either his ambition or <HI>revenge</HI>; he therefore devotes an whole people to the sword, as objects of his <HI>vengeance.</HI> A vast number,
<Q>not l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss than eight-hundred-thousand souls,</Q>
(as an ancient historian observes<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Herodot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</NOTE>) are marked out as objects of his <HI>hellish</HI> FURY—these a very useful and industrious people, were ser∣viceable both to the <HI>trade</HI> and <HI>manufactures</HI> of the kingdom, as well as in <HI>agriculture</HI>; in the destruction of whom, both the king and state must have suffered immense LOSS. He asks, and obtains the royal assent, and signature, to butcher them all in a day. Horrid massacre! Shocking to humanity! The picture of insernals! What baseness! What turpitude, is not the human mind capable of, when under the power of
<PB N="10" REF="014352_0008_0F91ED1A4922C690"/>
ambition and revenge? "<HI>Man lest of</HI> God, <HI>without heaven't restraint, is more savage, than the savage brute; his vile ferocity rises in proportion to his capacity.</HI>"</P>
<P>But how did this incarnate DAEMON, get this inhuman, this <HI>blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> DECREE?

<P>This wicked <HI>Haman</HI> found means to keep the KING in ig∣norance of the character, state, and condition of his own sub∣jects, he scarce knows who, or what these Jews are? Much less their <HI>importance</HI> to him—he had to learn their character from his court favourite—from <HI>Haman</HI> the Jews <HI>implacable</HI> ENEMY. And no wonder that the king thinks <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l of them</HI>— no wonder they stand in a <HI>bad light with him</HI>— no wonder he considers them as a <HI>public nusance</HI>—no wonder that when he had given up his <HI>senses</HI> and <HI>understanding</HI> to a tyranni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>blood-thirsty</HI> MINISTER OF STATE—that he should give into his hands the <HI>objects</HI> of his <HI>vengeance.</HI> This is no new thing un∣der the son, for greedy courtiers to misrepresent, to their prince, those of their fellow-subjects, that they would plun∣der and destroy; that by the help of his <HI>authority,</HI> they may compass their <HI>oppress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve designs,</HI> and spread ruin and devastati∣on through the empire, that they and their tools may <HI>fatten</HI> upon the <HI>plunder.</HI></P>

And how? Why by cutting off eight or nine-hundred thousand of its industrious and honest subjects: A true picture this of court <HI>china<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery</HI> and ministerial flattery!

<P>But behold! An <HI>omnipotent</HI> GOD "<HI>reigneth, let the Earth rejoice, let the multitude of Isles be glad.

his hand might be the better seen, and acknowledged.— <HI>Behold!</HI> the <HI>scene</HI> changes, and the counsels and devices of the wicked, are <HI>turned</HI> upon their <HI>own heads.</HI></P>
<P>It is now worth while to pause a minute—and attend to the temper and conduct of <HI>GOD's</HI> people, in this critical <HI>junc∣ture</HI> and dilemma of their affairs. It was a serious and so∣lemn time with them, and no doubt their danger lay with due weight upon their minds. But they did not <HI>despair,</HI> they did not give themselves over for <HI>lost</HI>; they <HI>firmly</HI> believed the be∣ing of a <HI>GOD,</HI> and that he was their <HI>covenant God,</HI> and that he was higher than the highest, and that he could with infinite ease, extricate them out of their sore distress; <HI>that his arm was not shortned that he could not save, neither his ear heavy that he could not hear.</HI> They now humbled themselves before the Lord their Maker, they cried unto him for help in this dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess; they caught hold of, and improved every probable human means within their power for their safety; but they put their <HI>trust</HI> only in the Lord <HI>their GOD.</HI></P>
<P>They ask counsel of, and are guided by their <HI>wisest</HI> and <HI>be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> men, in the same <HI>peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> MORDECAI, the <HI>principal</HI> a∣mong the Jews, and <HI>object</HI> of <HI>Haman's</HI> most inveterate hate, conducts with uncommon wisdom and <HI>courage.</HI></P>
<P>The first object of his attention, is (after seeking divine help and aid) to open the King's eyes, which were blinded by court <HI>flatterers,</HI> and ministerial intrigues; that he might know the truth, and understand his own true interest, and that of the empire:—An expression this of true loyalty, and a good example for others in similar circumstances;— and the good Lord in his kind providence ordered a fa∣vourable opportunity for this, by advancing <HI>ESTHER</HI> his neice, of the seed of the Jews to be <HI>Queen</HI> of the <HI>Realm,</HI> and the King's favourite.</P>
<P><HI>Mordecai,</HI> treats her with respect, according to her <HI>dignity,</HI> but talk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to her with his usual plainness and <HI>authority</HI>; he bids her interceed in earnest for the LIFE of her people; and reminds her that her place at court, was not <HI>certain</HI> to <HI>screen</HI> her from the impec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="014352_0012_0F91ED1D49377B58"/>She pauses, she considers, and at last <HI>resolves</HI>; but a great embarrassment arises in her way, she had not been called into the king's presence for <HI>thirty</HI> days, and uncertain when she should; besides, a <HI>cruel statute,</HI> (and unsafe for all princes, as well as there subjects) like a <HI>flaming sword,</HI> stands in the way of her approaching the throne. For by a <HI>statute</HI> of the <HI>realm</HI> no person might approach the throne, <HI>uncalled</HI> upon pain of <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>In this, we have an <HI>exact</HI> picture of court <HI>parasit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and <HI>ministerial</HI> TYRANTS: They make <HI>Princes</HI> prisoners of state, and shut out (if possible) from the <HI>royal presence all</HI> persons but themselves, and their creatures, and all <HI>petitions</HI> but those of their own prefering, or that reach the royal ear through the channel of their favour.</P>
<P>There policy in this, is, to keep the <HI>groans,</HI> and COM∣PLAINTS of those <HI>subjects</HI> whom they <HI>oppress,</HI> from moving the <HI>compassion</HI> of the royal HEART; that, by his <HI>ignorance,</HI> of their villainy they may secure to themselves his <HI>favour,</HI> and escape the <HI>punishment</HI> due to their atrocious <HI>Crimes</HI>: And so go on, to pillage and oppress mankind with <HI>impunity.</HI>— But if a <HI>torrent</HI> of murmures, and <HI>general</HI> complaints, should at any time arise, too <HI>mighty</HI> for their <HI>strength</HI> to encounter, or <HI>wisdom</HI> to quiet, if possible they will throw the public <HI>odium</HI> upon their <HI>master</HI>; and <HI>screen</HI> themselves behind his <HI>a∣bused authority</HI>: or <HI>perhaps</HI> in this case, they may sacrifice a few of their <HI>obsequious tools,</HI> those lesser villains, those <HI>Jack∣als,</HI> that have barked after the <HI>Lyons,</HI> to still the popular <HI>rage,</HI> and to save their <HI>own BACON.</HI></P>
<P>But how much more <HI>safe,</HI> and happy would it be, for both <HI>princes</HI> and their <HI>subjects,</HI> if (like <HI>Pharamond</HI> an ancient prince of <HI>France,</HI> who had a court gate, that was called <HI>The Gate of the Distressed,</HI> because there he heard in person, the complaints of the meanest of his subjects) their palaces and ears were open to the complaints of the oppressed, without the parade of state, or ministerial gloss or disguise, against the greatest of their servants.</P>
<P>But Queen ESTHER and <HI>Mordecai,</HI> strengthned by a firm saith in <HI>GOD,</HI> and clothed with heroic fortitude, were
<PB N="15" REF="014352_0013_0F91ED1E0914DFF8"/>
determined to surmount all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se difficulties and dangers, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bring their complaint and petition to the royal ear at the peril of their lives, to give him the true <HI>state</HI> of their affairs, and to acquaint the king with the whole of the hellish plot form∣ed against them at all adventures.</P>
<P>Nothing can discover greater human wisdom, a more thorough acquaintance with men and <HI>things,</HI> or more 2 <HI>fortitude</HI> of soul, than is discovered in the <HI>management</HI> of this great, delicate and difficult AFFAIR. They seem to be under a di∣vine <HI>efflat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of wisdom and policy.</P>
<P>Thus while <HI>they,</HI> like men, used the most probable <HI>means</HI> For their safety, the Lord JEHOVAH was working for them; and in a remarkable manner paved the way for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> destruction of <HI>Haman</HI> the Jews enemy, by advancing the <HI>devot∣ed Mordecai</HI> to honour and dignity, and that through the very means by which <HI>Haman</HI> thought to aggrandize himself. Of the circumstances of the king's not sleeping, and how he was <HI>di∣rected</HI> to turn over <HI>Court RECORDS</HI> for his amusement, and there find that <HI>Mordecai</HI> had saved his life, and <HI>Haman's</HI> ad∣vice on this <HI>affair</HI> with a view to his <HI>own</HI> honour; I need not remind you:—These where surprising interpositions of <HI>GOD's</HI> providence, in favour of his oppressed people, and ladly morti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying to the <HI>Persian</HI> PREMIER.—And had not his heart been <HI>callous</HI> to a sense of guilt and shame, as well as to the <HI>feelings</HI> of <HI>humanity</HI> (like all others of the same stamp) he must have been filled with <HI>horror,</HI> and trembling <HI>seized</HI> him, for fear of a sad reverse of <HI>fortune.</HI></P>
<P>But, now the important hour comes! And <HI>Haman</HI> the TYRANT and MURDERER <HI>present!</HI> When the King's <HI>ear</HI> was to be opened to hear the cries of the distressed, and his <HI>heart</HI> to pity, and afford them help.—ESTHER the Queen brings her request to the royal ear,—instead of <HI>half</HI> the king∣dom it is only this! <HI>Let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request, for we are sold to be slain, and to perish. And</HI> Haman <HI>thou art the man that hath done this</HI>—brought up the <HI>rear,</HI> in this heavy complaint.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>king's</HI> understanding is for <HI>once</HI> unloosed, and his eyes opened, he is cut to the heart with shame, at the re∣proof
<PB N="16" REF="014352_0014_0F91ED1EC8FEEAE0"/>
given <HI>him,</HI> which was wisely couched in the petition: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the <HI>instigation</HI> of the <HI>Minister</HI> it was the that <HI>King</HI> told them, and <HI>Haman</HI> had only bought them, as <HI>Minister</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tate</HI> with the King's money.—Thus were they bought and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old as <HI>cattle</HI> for the slaughter.—Here we see despotism epi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mised!</P>
<P>But the king stung with remorse, that he had been blinded and <HI>fooled</HI> by an haughty minister, and shock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at his own conduct in that affair, justly devotes the <HI>deceiver</HI> and <HI>murder∣er</HI> to ruin; for bringing guilt and odium upon his <HI>Prince,</HI> and fear and <HI>distress</HI> upon his subjects; by slanders and cruel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use of his power, and influence with him.</P>
<P>Such an example, one would be ready to think, would be sufficient to make all <HI>crowned</HI> heads cautious of giving impli∣cit faith to courtiers and <HI>place-men; sufficient</HI> to make them ever jealous of aspiring ambitious <HI>ministers,</HI> and <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re</HI> in scrutinizing into <HI>their</HI> public conduct, and careful to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch their <HI>motions</HI> in all their actions respecting public affairs; and as effectual in punishing every fraud and deceit of this kind, that tends to alienate the affections of their loyal subjects from them, and to six upon them the <HI>odium</HI> of cruelty and OP∣PRESSION.—<HI>O that Princes were wise, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this!</HI></P>
<P>But now behold! the bloody <HI>Decree</HI> reversed! <HI>reversed</HI> did I say? no, it was not; but rather in a sort superceded by an∣other.—To such a <HI>pitch</HI> of pride, folly, and madness, had the <HI>Persian court</HI> arrived, that they had assumed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>omniscience,</HI> essential perfections of JEHOVAH; for it had become a <HI>Statute</HI> of the realm, that their <HI>Laws</HI> should not be <HI>repealed,</HI> or their <HI>Decrees revoked.</HI>—Egregious folly! And how is it copied, in the conduct of most <HI>cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> in all great <HI>empires</HI>; though the principle may not be op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly avowed. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thus it comes to pass, that rather than <HI>honestly</HI> to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tract one error, <HI>known</HI> and <HI>fully</HI> discovered, they go on to comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t an hundred more, as <HI>remedies</HI> of the former, until the REMEDY is worse than the DISEASE; untill their <HI>inexplicable turnings,</HI> and political windings, have thrown the affairs of the nation, into such an amazing <HI>suarl,</HI> and labyrinth, as that it is, next

to impossible for <HI>human</HI> wisdom to <HI>unravel</HI> them: And thus by such <HI>designing</HI> selfish politics, the state often <HI>trembles,</HI> and some <HI>times</HI> the <HI>crown</HI> to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers; or what is worse, if such <HI>traitors</HI> and <HI>tyrants</HI> continue their influence, the nation will be <HI>Enslaved,</HI> and dwindle to <HI>barbarism</HI> and <HI>brutality.</HI> How the remedy would have operated in the case before us, had not divine wisdom and power interposed, is hard to say; but the LORD over-ruled it well; the Lord JEHOVAH is able to bring <HI>good</HI> out of evil, <HI>light</HI> out of darkness, and did so now! And is abl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <HI>ready</HI> to do it <HI>again.</HI></P>
<P>ESTHER and <HI>Mordecai</HI> obtain a <HI>decree</HI> in favour of the Jews, and with a <HI>view</HI> to their salvation. But let us attend a minute, to the <HI>tenor</HI> of the <HI>decree,</HI> and let us see what mighty BOON! Is the former decree <HI>reversed?</HI> No: Are the bloody orders <HI>countermanded?</HI> No, not a word of this. What does the whole amount to? Why, only to what GOD and <HI>Nature al∣lowed</HI> them, yea, <HI>demanded</HI> of them before—<HI>To arise, to ga∣ther themselves together in</HI> EVERY CITY, <HI>and to stand for their</HI> LIFE, <HI>and to destroy, and to cause to perish</HI>; Whom? And what persons? Was it their honest neighbours, that had no hand in the plot? No <HI>verily</HI>; but all the power and persons, <HI>that would</HI> ASSAULT <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>The grant amounted to this, and no more, that they might stand on their <HI>defence</HI> against all <HI>court tools,</HI> and ministerial <HI>crea∣tures</HI> and <HI>minions,</HI> that taking the <HI>advantage</HI> of the former de∣cree should be found in <HI>arms</HI> to <HI>assault</HI> them. And who would not (unless it be a coward or a fool) defend himself, if possible from the assault of a <HI>banditti</HI> of villains that would cut his throat.</P>
<P>But here let us attend to the sequel, and <HI>well</HI> notice the issue.—By this last decree the innocent Jews (just now re∣presented, as a contemptible mean spirited set of mortals) and their <HI>haughty</HI> enemies were put upon an <HI>equal</HI> footing. Now let us see the <HI>personal</HI> bravery of ministeral <HI>blood-suckers</HI> and TYRANTS, and the whole GANG of their <HI>dependant</HI> bravadoes, through all the provinces of this vast <HI>empire.</HI> For no doubt <HI>Haman</HI> the <HI>Premier,</HI> and his junto of court <HI>favourites, flat∣terers,</HI> and <HI>dependants</HI> in the royal city, together with <HI>govern∣ors</HI> of provinces, <HI>counsellors, bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds of trade, commissioners</HI> and

<P>It is true that the Jews were the LORD's <HI>covenant</HI> people, and that they humbled themselves before the Lord their Ma∣ker and Redeemer, and earnestly sought his <HI>he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p,</HI> while they stood o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their own defence.

<P>The <HI>example</HI> of GOD's <HI>ancient</HI> covenant people, when on the brink of ruin may afford <HI>us</HI> instruction, under present distress; while on the one hand, it admonishes us, of the necessity and importance of fervent prayer and deep humiliati∣on, and a <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rough</HI> breaking of our sins by righteousness, and our iniquities by turning to the Lord; on the other, not to <HI>dispond</HI> or despair, but commit our cause to <HI>GOD,</HI> and stand FAST.</P>
<P>All human prudence, and wisdom, are to be exercised, yet if called by divine providence, (which we pray heaven to prevent) we must, we ought, as they did in the case before us, to <HI>improve</HI> the <HI>grant</HI> that every man has from the King of <HI>Heaven,</HI> "to <HI>arise, and stand</HI> for his Life, to kill and destroy <HI>all</HI> that ASSAULT them"—but none other!</P>

So in this way <HI>we</HI> also may hope that GOD will arise and plead <HI>our</HI> cause, and <HI>his</HI> OWN, against the op∣pressor—For the Cause of Liberty is the Cause of <HI>GOD</HI>; it is the <HI>gift</HI> of GOD to man in his very creation, and what he has fitted him for, as a <HI>summary</HI> of his <HI>terrestrial</HI> happiness: And whosoever gives it up, and tamely submits to <HI>Slavery,</HI> like a foolish or wanton <HI>Heir,</HI> spends the PATRIMONY of his Heavenly Father's <HI>giving,</HI> and is a <HI>rebel</HI> to GOD and NATURE.</P>
<P>The CAUSE of AMERICA (now in controversy) is the cause of <HI>GOD,</HI> never did Man struggle in a greater, or more <HI>glorious</HI> CAUSE, It will, it must <HI>appear,</HI> to Heaven and Earth, that we are not the <HI>aggressors</HI> in this sad controversy! we <HI>ask,</HI> we <HI>contend</HI> for nothing more, than what <HI>God</HI> and

nature gave us, to <HI>enjoy</HI> our OWN, without <HI>rapine</HI> or <HI>robbe∣ry.</HI> This we hold not only by the Law of Nature, but by the Faith, and Contract of KINGS stipulated in the most So∣lemn CHARTERS under their Sign and Seal Manual<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the Tenure, by which <HI>Americans</HI> hold their property and possessions in this land, especially in <HI>New England.</HI> They hold the <HI>Foe</HI> and <HI>Dominion</HI> under GOD alone, the great Sovereign and Proprietor of all things; and no other being, or number of beings in the universe, have the least right to wrest them from their hands. Our fathers fled into this wilderness, in an arbitrary reign; and from the iron hand of op∣pression at home, that they might enjoy civil and religious <HI>Liberty,</HI> her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> undisturbed, and hand down the invaluable treasure to the latest posteri∣ty. This hope carried them through all the amazing dangers and hard∣ships that attended the enterprize; this supported them in all their un∣paralleled conflicts. They aimed at the North part of <HI>Virginia,</HI> but divine providence cast them into <HI>Plymouth</HI> harbour, they settled the town called <HI>Plymouth,</HI> from thence they spread; this may be called the root of the <HI>New-England</HI> settlements. They found the country possessed by, and under the dominion of a number of independent states, who held it un∣der the of GOD of Nature—it was their own—and our fathers had no right to dispossess them of it: Our pious fathers well knew this, and therefore they purchased of them both the soil and dominion. Now they were in a state of nature, independent of any state or kingdom in the world, and at liberty to chuse what form of government they pleased, and might have put themselves under the protection of any of the powers of <HI>Europe.</HI> But they being <HI>Britons,</HI> and emigrants from that isle, they made choice of the <HI>British</HI> King for their Protector, on account of their con∣nexions, and the conveniences of <HI>British</HI> protection, and not on account of any dominion <HI>Britain</HI> had over them: Accordingly, the <HI>British</HI> King made a Contract with them, and they with him; he promised in his part of the Contract that he would protect them, &amp;c.—and they promis∣ed on their part, allegiance to him as their king, (<HI>i. e.</HI>) to subject them∣selves to him so far, as they had stipulated in the Contract, as therein expressed, and no further. Now this Contract between the <HI>British</HI> king, and the <HI>First</HI> settlers of this land, was called a CHARTER. This, and this only is the <HI>measure</HI> of the connexion there is between the two <HI>Englands.</HI> This, and this only, can with <HI>justice</HI> determine, in what cases, and to what purposes the king of <HI>England</HI> has dominion here, and how far we owe obedience. The true <HI>meaning</HI> and intent of the first <HI>Contract</HI> or <HI>Charter,</HI> is the original bond of union between this province, and our king; how far our original rights were altered by the second Charter—I leave for politicians to determine. Most people in the province, I presume, are acquainted with the <HI>shipwreck</HI> of our Charter, in the time of <HI>Andross.</HI> In that tyrannie reign, there was a violent, and general wreck of Charters, and <HI>ours,</HI> (for what reason I know not) wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the only one that suffered in the <HI>restoration,</HI> at the Revolution; but so it was, and our original Charter Rights and Privileges were much curtail∣ed, and the <HI>People</HI> of the Province, had but the shadow of authority left them, in comparison of the former. The most <HI>material</HI> Privilege left us, was that of raising our own money, or in other words the <HI>Exclusive</HI> right of <HI>Taxing</HI> ourselves, that our purses and property should be under our own direction. This sacred PALLADIUM, a <HI>British</HI> parliament, would now wrench from us with violence, which if they accomplish, with us, pro∣perty is no mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, the very ideas of Liberty and Property are lost, and we are SLAVES; but we have an origin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herent right, to the same privileges, with our sister Colony of <HI>Connecticut.</HI> For this, is the spirit of the <HI>first,</HI> the original Contract, between the king of <HI>England</HI> and us; upon which this Province was <HI>settled,</HI> at the amazing expence and la∣bour of our fathers, and without cost to the crown of <HI>England.</HI> I con∣sider the parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as (of <HI>right</HI>) having no kind of <HI>dominion</HI> over us, or concern with us, for they were no party in the Con∣tract, there exists not, nor ever did, any kind of Contract or Bargain between us and them; we never chose them to legislate for us, they do not, they <HI>cannot</HI> represent us; therefore instead of the <HI>shocking Claim</HI> to bind us, by their <HI>Acts</HI> in ALL CASES WHATSOEVER, they have no right to bind us in ANY CASE WHATEVER: We are, it is true bound to the king, and he to us, according to the spirit and design of the Char∣ter Contract, which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver have been, and are still willing to fulfill on our part to a jot and tittle, and have right to expect his protection, in the peaceable enjoyment of all our natural Rights and <HI>Charter Privileges</HI>;— and the moment the Charter Contract is violated on the other part, we are again in a state of <HI>nature,</HI> and have a right to set out anew, but the interest of both parties is to maintain the connexion inviolate—and may heaven prevent a disunion. The notion that some maintain in the controversy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s so absurd and childish that it scarce deserves a refutation: That the allegiance of a <HI>British</HI> subject, (and the authority of parliament too, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f they mean any thing to the purpose in the present controversy) follows him wherever he goes, even to the ends of the earth. This, if it proves a∣ny thing, proves <HI>unspeakably</HI> too much; upon <HI>this</HI> supposition, if a <HI>num∣ber</HI> of <HI>Britons</HI> should take it into their heads to purchase a large tract of land in <HI>France, Spain, China,</HI> or <HI>Japan,</HI> and remove there with their families, they would be still subject to the <HI>British</HI> king, and be yet un∣der parliamentary authority, they must carry their code of <HI>British</HI> laws with them, and be subject to them however counter to the laws of the state where they reside; the <HI>absurdity</HI> of this is obvious to common un∣derstandings. No less ridiculous, is another tenet, advanced in the pre∣sent controversy—That <HI>New England</HI> was first discovered by subjects of the crown of <HI>England,</HI> and therefore ought to be considered as part of the realm, and subject to all its acts, laws and regulations; but suppose it is fact that an <HI>English</HI> merchant-man, sailed within sight of <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> or what is more likely some western Cape, or head land, and saw the shore at a distance, would the consequences follow from it? By no <HI>means.</HI> Supposing an Indian of <HI>New England</HI> (as it is now called)▪ should have been so luckly as to have crossed the Atlantic in his birch canoe, and should have discovered <HI>England,</HI> or some part of the <HI>European</HI> continent; would that have given the Sachem of his tribe propriety in the soil, or right to the <HI>dominion</HI> of those countries? As much and no more than in the case before us; the truth of the matter is, that the relation of this country, to <HI>England</HI> was <HI>merely</HI> ideal, till our fathers purchased it, took possession of it, and connected it with <HI>Britain</HI> by <HI>Charter</HI> and solemn <HI>Compact.</HI> This Charter and Compact, is therefore the only <HI>rule,</HI> by which our dependanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon, and subjection to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> must of <HI>right</HI> be determined, set aside this, and of <HI>right</HI> we are absolutely in∣dependent of them, or any other state.

<P>And if our <HI>King</HI> is angry with us, it is because <HI>Men</HI> of the beforementioned <HI>Character</HI> have <HI>imposed</HI> upon him, by sordid <HI>Slanders</HI> and infamous lies against the good people of <HI>America,</HI> and of this Province in <HI>particular.</HI> Therefore his wrath <HI>can∣not</HI> be against the true character of these Colonies, but a <HI>false</HI> PICTURE drawn by our enemies, with a <HI>view</HI> to aggrandize themselves, and promote their black design of enslaving AMERICA.

If ye do not ye are <HI>Slaves</HI> But is their no <HI>Lightning</HI> in the hidden stores of Heaven, <HI>red</HI> with uncommon wrath to blast the men, that have called these mercenaries to your land, the <HI>ingrateful</HI> men that abet the despotic plan, and would owe their greatness to their COUNTRY'S RUIN? Is it not <HI>real,</HI> or is it all illusion; the voice is indeed illusion: But are not the sentiments real and just. The sentiments of all wise men, the patriots of every coun∣try, the experience of all ages, bare TESTIMONY <HI>against</HI> a standing ARMY, as <HI>inconsistent</HI> with LIBERTY. When ever there exists a power in the state sufficient, to trample upon or <HI>controul</HI> its LAWS, THAT STATE IS NO LONGER FREE.</P>

Trials and conflicts you must, therefore, endure;—hazards and jeopardies—of life and for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>une— will attend the struggle.

Having engaged in the conflict, let nothing discourage your vigour, or re∣pel your perseverance:—Remember, that submission to the yoke of bondage is the worst that can befall a people after the most fierce and unsuccessful resistance.
