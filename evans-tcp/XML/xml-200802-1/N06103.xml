<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O teach the Art of War, is not the Office of the Ministers of the PRINCE OF PEACE: The Gospel breathes the most extensive Benevolence to Man∣kind; and has the highest Tendency to unite all Nations of the Earth, in inviolable Friendship.</P>
<P>IT is our Departure from God, that renders us Enemies to one another: The extravagant Lusts of Men enkindle those Fires of Contention, which con∣sume the Beauty of this lower Creation, and trans∣form the Globe we inhabit into <HI>a Valley of Tears.</HI>— Did the Spirit of <HI>Jesus</HI> universally prevail, it would subdue that Ambition and Avarice, which are the Source of so many Miseries to a guilty World.—It would inspire the Breasts of Princes with that dis∣interested Goodness, which would soon diffuse Order
<PB N="8" REF="007749_0005_102D72E7690CED28"/>
and Harmony, among the different Cantons of Man∣kind.—Then the Arts of Peace would triumph over the Policies of War; the Fields of Death, smile in all the unrifled Charms of Nature; and this disor∣dered Earth, become a <HI>Paradise</HI> of Beauty and Pleasure.</P>
<P>BUT since the happy Day is not yet come, when <HI>the Nations shall beat their Swords into Plow-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks.</HI>— Since, in the Dispensations of Providence, we hear <HI>the Sound of the Trumpet, and the Alarm of War;</HI> and are call'd to <HI>gird on the Sword, and prepare the Instruments of Battle.</HI>— It is becoming the Character of a Minister of the Gospel, to shew what Direction, Encourage∣ment, and Assistance, the <HI>Book of God</HI> affords us, on these melancholy Occasions.</P>
<P>I am perswaded, none of my present Audience will question, whether the Profession of a Soldier is consistent with the Character of a Christian: We know, that many of the Military Order, have, in all Ages, appear'd the shining Ornaments of the Church of Christ, as well as the strongest Bulwarks of civil Society: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>MANY of the first Fathers of <HI>New-England,</HI> justly deserved this Character;—they were noble Instances of sublime Piety, and martial Accomplishments. —they were equally qualified to adorn the Church by their exemplary Vertue, and defend it by their Valour.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the present Age has not produc'd a more truly Chris∣tian Hero, than the late Col. GARDINER, who maintain'd uninterrupted Communion with Heaven, amidst the Tumults and Disorders of a Camp—and after a Life spent in perpetual Toils and Dangers, in the Service of his Country, —died in the Bed of Honor, fighting against the Enemies, of the civil and religious Liberties of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI>—I wish the Life of this devout Warrior, wrote by the late celebrated Dr. <HI>Doddridge,</HI> was in the Hands of all the Gentlemen of a Mi∣litary Character. I am perswaded, it would afford them an agreable Entertainment, and the best Instruction.</P></NOTE> They have merited the public
<PB N="9" REF="007749_0006_102DA82361599900"/>
Esteem, as much by the Charms of their Vertue, as by the Splendor of their Conquests.</P>
<P>THE Great God, condescends to wear the Title of a MAN OF WAR; and Princes, His Vicegerents here below, are commanded, not to bear the Sword in vain.—When the Faith of Treaties is violated, the Rights of a Community invaded, all Proposals of Accommodation obstinately rejected,—it becomes the immediate Duty of the supreme Magistrate, to have Recourse to Arms; that he may establish Peace, pro∣tect Innocence, humble the Proud Oppressors of the Earth, and put a Stop to the Progress of Tyranny and Usurpation.</P>
<P>THE only Question is,— How we shall behave, when call'd to War, so as not to violate the Obliga∣tion of our Christian Profession, or injure the Rights of our fellow Creatures,—but maintain the Character of <HI>good Soldiers of Jesus Christ,</HI> and successful Ser∣vants of the Common-wealth?—In this the Word of God is <HI>profitable to direct.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apostle causes the illustrious Heroes of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church, to pass in Review before us; and proposes their noble Example, for the Imitation of the People of God in all Ages. By Faith, they passed thro' the severest Trials, surmounted the most terrifying Dangers, <HI>waxed valiant in Fight, put to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apostle, in this Chapter, speaks of <HI>Faith</HI> in the most extensive Signification of the Word.—He intends that divine Principle, which inclines us to adore the Perfections of the infinite Deity, to resign ourselves to the Government of His Providence, to believe the Revelations of His Word, to depend on the Promises of his Grace, to obey his sovereign Or∣ders,—in Times of the greatest Difficulty and Dan∣ger,—notwithstanding the Terrors and Allurements of this <HI>present evil World.</HI>—This is that Faith which
<PB N="10" REF="007749_0007_102DA824E63DB410"/>
animated these ancient Worthies▪ and enabled them to perform these mighty Exploits, which were the Glory of the past, and will be the Admiration of future Ages. The same Faith should animate the Breasts of the military Gentlemen of the present Day, if they would receive the Honors▪ and enjoy the Suc∣cess of their illustrious Predecessors. To show</P>
<P>HOW admirably this Faith is calculated to produce this happy Effect, is the Design of my present Dis∣course. Faith teaches us to engage in War upon the noblest Principles,—it inclines us to prosecute it with intrepid Valour,—It secures us the most powerful Assistance,—It promises us the most glorious Reward. —This is the Plan of my Discourse, the Subject of your serious Attention.—</P>
<P>FIRST, Faith teaches us, to engage in War upon the noblest Principles.</P>
<P>WHAT was the Spirit, that animated <HI>the Pompey</HI>'s▪ <HI>and Caesar</HI>'s, and other celebrated Warriors of the Heathen World?— What is the Spirit, that animates many of our Modern Heroes?—Their Characters are surrounded with a false Blaze of Glory; their Names are trasmitted to Posterity, in flattering Titles of Honor; they are profanely stiled invincible Con∣querors, Arbiters of Peace and War, Disposers of the Fate of Kingdoms.—Thus the Truth is disguised by their servile Dependants; and their secret Designs conceal'd, by all the Refinements of Art and Elo∣quence.—But if we examine their Conduct, with an unprejudiced Mind, we shall immediately find, the fatal Influence of insatiable Avarice,—insolent Pride, —unbounded Ambition.</P>
<P>FAITH inspires its Heroes with nobler Motives, agreable to the Dignity of human Nature, and the Sanctity of our Christian Profession.—A supreme Re∣gard to the Glory of God, a sincere Desire to establish Peace among Mankind, a disinterested Zeal for the
<PB N="11" REF="007749_0008_102DA826948BEB10"/>
publick Welfare▪ influence their Conduct.—The Call of God▪ and their Country▪ brings them into the Field of Battle.—The Enemies they oppose▪ are Pride, Perfidy, and Violence:—These they fight against without Revenge, conquer without Haughtiness, tri∣umph over without Insolence.—Undissembled Love reigns in their Breasts▪ when engaged▪ in the most ter∣rible Acts of publick Vengeance: Their Bowels melt, with the tenderest Compassion▪ when their Hands are stained with Blood: They devoutly adore the Creator, when obliged by sad Necessity to destroy His Creatures.</P>
<P>THE Religion of JESUS teaches its faithful Dis∣ciples, to do no Violence▪ to advance their private In∣terest▪ to commit no Injury▪ to increase the Lustre of their Reputation▪ to shed not a Drop of Blood, but what may be serviceable to the Cause of Truth and Justice — It requires us▪ to endeavour to subdue our Enemies▪ without destroying them▪ to resist their hostile Attempts without violating the sacred Obliga∣tions of Charity▪ to reduce them to Reason, by Me∣thods the least severe and angry —This is to act <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> OF JESUS CHRIST▪ to obey the bene∣volent Precepts of the GREAT CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION. When we engage in War, in this Dis∣position of Mind.</P>
<P>SECONDLY▪ Faith enables us to prosecute it with intrepid Valor.</P>
<P>TRUE Valor. My Brethren▪ is not an indiscreet Impetuosity, which hurries us into the greatest Dan∣gers, without Tho't; and ventures upon immediate Death▪ without any Prospect of Advantage.— But a noble Greatness of Mind▪ which inclines a Person to obey the Voice of God and His People, tho' it calls him to the most dangerous Enterprizes: Its Ardor is increased at the View of an Enemy▪ It rises superi∣or to every Difficulty, that is found in the Path of
<PB N="12" REF="007749_0009_102DA829B99D9688"/>
Duty; and is ready to sacrifice Life itself, rather than endanger the publick Safety.</P>
<P>THIS generous Fortitude never resides in the Breasts of the Wicked; the accustomed Practice of Vice de∣stroys the Health of the Body, relaxes the Vigor of the Mind, makes Men capable only of mean and mercenary Designs.</P>
<P>OF this, we have numberless Examples, in anci∣ent and modern History. While the <HI>Romans</HI> conti∣nued uncorrupted, their Empire <HI>was strong as Iron,</HI> according to the significant Representation of the Pro∣phet <HI>Daniel.</HI>— The Severity of their Manners was the great Occasion of the Rapidity of their Conquests— The Grandeur of their Common-wealth was the Reward of their national Justice and Temperence. But when their ancient Discipline was weakned; and the Vices of the conquered, corrupted the Hearts of the Conquerors—<HI>their Iron became,</HI> immediately min∣gled <HI>with Clay</HI>—the Foundations of their Govern∣ment were soon overthrown, and their once victorious Legions, were easily put to Flight, by Troops of undisciplin'd Barbarians.</P>
<P>NOW, the Principles of the Christian Faith pre∣serve us from those Vices, which deprave the sound Constitution both of Body and Mind; and transform valiant Heroes, into effeminate Cowards.— It estab∣lishes that strict Government of the Passions, <HI>which is Health to the Navel, and Marrow to the Bones;</HI> and naturally forms us to every great and good Design.</P>
<P>UNDER the Influence of this Faith, the Christian Soldier begins his Days with Prayer—exercises his Authority to suppress the Prevalence of Vice—em∣ploys his Power to protect the Liberties of Mankind. He invocates in every Danger the God of Armies; and sanctifies the Violence of War, by the Purity of his Intentions, and the Desire to procure an happy Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007749_0010_102DA82BC6679278"/>ANIMATED by these sublime Motives, he enters the Field of Battle with holy Magnanimity, encoun∣ters all Difficulties with a firm and undaunted Reso∣lution: He possesses his Soul in Peace, tho' sur∣rounded with Enemies, and is not intimidated by their Power or Policy.—He adopts the grateful Language of the Psalmist. <HI>Some trust in Chariots and some in Horses;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 20.7.</NOTE> <HI>but we will re∣member the Name of the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD. The Providence of God, which governs the Affairs of this lower World in unerring Wisdom, renders him secure in every Event.—The Promises of His Word, <HI>that no Evil shall happen to the Just,</HI> keep him un∣dismayed in the most hazardous Situation.—What has that Man to fear? Who has infinite Wisdom for his Guide—Almighty Power for his Defence—and an Assurance from the <HI>God of Truth,</HI> that <HI>all Things shall work together for his Good.</HI> This gave <HI>David</HI> that noble Fortitude in Seasons of the highest Extre∣mity and Distress. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>is on my Side. I will not fear:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 118.6.</NOTE> <HI>What can Man do unto me? Tho' an Host should en∣camp against me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 27.3▪</NOTE> <HI>my Heart shall not fear: Tho' War should rise against me, in this will I be confident.</HI> This brings to say,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Faith secures us the most powerful Assistance.</P>
<P>IT is the Wisdom of all Nations, to form a potent Alliance when engaging in War. Well cemented Confederacies, have a natural Influence to secure Success to our Enterprizes. When different Nations join in Concert for their mutual Defence, and act with united Vigor; it makes the proud Oppressors of the Earth to tremble, and their royal Diadems totter on their Heads.</P>
<P>BUT after all, it must be acknowleded the Events of War are uncertain: the most wise and valiant
<PB N="14" REF="007749_0011_102DA82DCDF034F0"/>
Captains are not always crown'd with Victory, nor the most numerous and best disciplin'd Troops fa∣voured with Success. <HI>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong. No King is saved by the Multitude of an Host, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it a mighty Man de∣livered by much Strength.</HI> The supreme Monarch of the Universe, directs the Fate of War according to His sovereign and irresistable Pleasure.—It is equally easy with Him, to save by many or by few.</P>
<P>IT is, therefore, the highest Wisdom to engage the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> on our Side, and the Extremity of Folly to provoke Him to undertake the Cause of our Enemies. Now nothing is more acceptable to Him, than a firm Dependance on his Power—Provi∣dence— and Grace.— This is the Practice of the Christian Warrior, and the sure Way to Prosperity.</P>
<P>THE Wicked bid Defiance to Heaven▪ even when they stand in the greatest Need of its Assistance — they affront the <HI>God of Battles</HI>▪ when surrounded with the dreadful <HI>Artillery</HI> of His Wrath.—They depend on the Number of their Forces, the Valor of their Troops, the Depth of their Stratagems▪ to secure them the Fortune of the Day.— If they con∣quer, it is ascrib'd to their superior Strength and Wis∣dom. They erect Altars to their own Glory, and burn Incense to their Ambition and Vanity.</P>
<P>BUT, Faith teaches the Followers of Christ to renounce all Self-dependance: to fix their Expecta∣tions upon the supreme Disposer of all Things, and to give the Glory of all their Success to Him, to whom it justly belongs.—If they march, they look to God their Director and Guide.— If they encamp▪ they know except God be their Protector, the <HI>Watch∣men wake in vain.</HI>— If they fight, they are sensible from whence they derive all their military Strength. If they Conquer, they acknowledge that divine Hand, which alone crowns them with Victory and Triumph.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007749_0012_102DA8306429A8F0"/>IN this devout Disposition, we may form great De∣signs, and hope to execute them with happy Success. For God is the Confederate of His People, He pleads their Cause against their haughty Oppressors▪ appoints shining Guards of Angels to incircle their Tents, and will finally enable them to <HI>tread upon the Necks of their Enemies</HI>—Their Enemies may indeed for a Time prevail— But <HI>the triumphing of the Wicked is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Prosperity of Fools</HI> accelerates their Ruin; while <HI>the God of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>rides upon the Heavens for their Help▪ and in his Excellency on the Sky,</HI> for the Salvation of his People.</P>
<P>THIS divine Assistance▪ was the Source of all those Successes▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> attended God's ancient People the Pos∣terity of faithful▪ <HI>Abraham.</HI> When they were delivered from the Bondage of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>▪ the insulting Tyrant of <HI>Egypt</HI>▪ they did not levy Armies, besiege Cities, nor fight Battles: But God employ'd the Arm of Om∣nipotence in their Favour, commissioned Angels to be the Executioners of his Vengeance, and by an invisi∣ble Hand▪ destroy'd the <HI>first-born</HI> of that populous Nation: This made Way for the triumphant Depar∣ture of <HI>Israel</HI>▪ from the Land of their Oppressors.— When they were to pass the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> they had nei∣ther Boats nor Bridges, to facilitate their Passage; but God by a Miracle of Goodness, divided the Arabian Gulph, and conducted their numerous Tribes thro' the Bosom of the Sea.— When they conquer'd the City of <HI>Jerico,</HI> which oppos'd their Entrance in∣to the promis'd <HI>Canaan,</HI> it was not, by the Valor of their Captains, nor the Swords of their common Sol∣diers; but the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> who resided in the <HI>Ark,</HI> the Symbol of His majestick Presence, overthrew its lofty Towers, and levell'd its Walls with the Dust.— Therefore the inspir'd Psalmist tells them, they got <HI>the Land in Possession, not by their own Swords, but by the</HI> Arm of the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="007749_0013_102DA83218CCB970"/>THESE, it may justly be said, were the Days of Miracles, but have we not seen?— have not heard of the extraordinary Interpositions of Heaven, in Be∣half of his People, in these latter Ages?— To keep near Home— Was it not God that conducted the Siege of LOUISBOURG, thro' numberless Difficulties and Dangers, and open'd the Gates of that City, to a few unexperienced NEW-ENGLAND-Men. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vnder the Command of Sir WILLIAM PEPPERBELL.</NOTE> This gave a mighty Shock to the ambitious Designs of the <HI>French King,</HI> fir'd his Breast with Resentment, determined him to take a severe Revenge.</P>
<P>TO this End, he soon collected a formidable Force, design'd not only to recover his Loss, but scatter De∣struction thro' the Coasts of NORTH-AMERICA. We all remember, how greatly we were surprised when we heard their Fleet had actually sail'd to execute this fatal Scheme— No wonder every Face gathered Paleness, every Heart was seiz'd with Terror. We had every Thing to fear, which the Bigotry of <HI>Rome</HI>— the Tyranny of <HI>France,</HI>— the Rage of provoked Enemies, could contrive or inflict. Had they suc∣ceeded, we had nothing to expect, but to see our Ci∣ties in Flames— our Habitations demolished— our Virgins defloured—our Street delug'd with Blood,— and the Temples of our God prostituted to Supersti∣tion and Idolatry.</P>
<P>BUT, though destitute of human Assistance, our <HI>Help was in the Name of the Lord, who made Hea∣ven and Earth.</HI>—God sent a contagious Sickness among them, which dispirited their Generals, and ex∣ceedingly diminish'd the Number of their Forces: —Unwilling to return, without executing some Part of their intended Mischief, they summon'd all their Strength, and determined to make a resolute Attack on some of our <HI>Eastern Settlements,</HI>—God sent forth his Commission to the Winds, they heard his Voice,
<PB N="17" REF="007749_0014_102DA83424B53780"/>
and immediately gathered into a mighty Storm; and scattered their <HI>floating Castles,</HI> upon the <HI>Face of the great Deep.</HI>— This dissipated all their Hopes;—a small Remnant only return'd to their native Coun∣try, to tell the melancholly Story of their Losses and Disappointments.</P>
<P>THUS, in the Day of our Extremity, <HI>the Name of the Lord alone was exalted. His right Hand</HI> ob∣tain'd for us an easy Victory over our Enemies. Our Lives were preserv'd—Our Liberties maintain'd — our valuable Enjoyments secur'd—Not by our own <HI>Swords and Bows,</HI> but by the signal Interpositions of Heaven. This should engage us still to place our Dependance, upon the same all-powerful Assistance. <HI>His Arm is not shortned that He cannot save, nor is his Ear heavy that he cannot hear.</HI> In his Name then, <HI>Let us set up our Banner, and play the Men, for our People and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ties of our God.</HI> For our Encouragement, I shall further add,</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, Faith assures us of a glorious Re∣ward.</P>
<P>MANY of the Pagan Heroes fir'd with a Love of Fame, perform'd astonishing Exploits, for the Glory and Greatness of their Country. It is to be fear'd, that many of the most successful Captains in modern Times, have been influenc'd by no higher Motives in their military Atchievements.—When this is the Case, we erect Monuments to perpetuate the Re∣membrance of their Victories, but cannot enroll them among the Favourites of Heaven. While we cele∣brate their martial Honours, we shed Tears to think, that those who have so nobly serv'd the Purposes of divine Providence, must remain the eternal Objects of His Justice.—</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="007749_0015_102DA836B8A53C68"/>WHAT is this Fame! so ardently desired, so impa∣tiently pursued,—amidst a Thousand Deaths —thro' ten Thousand Dangers!— An airy Dream—A gilded Phantom—destitute of Truth and Reality.</P>
<P>BUT the Christian Soldier, animated with the Spirit of Faith and Charity, fights not for a Crown of fading Lawrels, but uncorruptible Glory; He receives the Applauses, not of false and flattering Mortals, but of God the true Fountain of Honor.</P>
<P>ASCEND, O Christian! above these Objects of Sense which surround you; fix your Thoughts on the ETERNAL DIVINITY: Behold him seated on a <HI>Throne of Light,</HI> encircled with Angels, Arch-Angels, and the whole HIERARCHY OF HEAVEN—Hark,— how loud do their Triumphant Voices sound!— with what transports of Joy do they ascribe.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 7.12.</NOTE> <HI>Blessing and Glory, and Honor and Power to our God forever and ever!</HI></P>
<P>YET▪ a little while, O Christian Soldier! and you shall be united to this shining Assembly, partake of their Joys, and join in their unceasing HALLELUJAHS. After you have fought under the Banners OF THE CROSS, your appointed Time; Death shall give the <HI>final Discharge:</HI> Whether you fall by the Stroke of Violence in the Field of Battle; or descend to the Grave, in the common Course of Nature; your immortal Spirit, shall be safely convey'd to the <HI>Pa∣radise</HI> of God.</P>
<P>THERE—the great CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION, shall address you in the Language of ineffable Grace, <HI>Well done thou good and faithful Servant.</HI>—There— He will fulfil that Promise, which he now makes to
<PB N="19" REF="007749_0016_102DA838D59A9BF0"/>
all his loyal and obedient Subjects. <HI>To him that overcometh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21.</NOTE> <HI>will I grant to sit with me in my Throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in His Throne.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is there, my Brethren, in the loud Applauses of the Age—in the magnificent Trophies of human Vanity—in the sparkling Diadems of Princes; that can be compar'd to the solid Honors, which are ap∣pointed for the Christian Hero, and the Crowns of Glory which are prepared for them in a future World.</P>
<P>IT remains, that I apply this Discourse to the <HI>Gentlemen in Arms,</HI> at whose Invitation we are now assembled in the House of God.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE ARTILLERY,</P>
<P>YOU appear, in the united Characters of <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Soldiers</HI>—Characters of Honor and Usefulness, which render you in an high Degree the Glory and Safety of the Community. The Design of the In∣stitution of your ancient and honourable Company, was not barely to qualify you to make an handsome Figure upon the <HI>Parade,</HI> and handle your Arms with Dexterity and Address in a <HI>Review:</HI> But that you might be distinguish'd Proficients in the <HI>military Art,</HI> and fit to lead on <HI>the Armies of Israel</HI> to Battle, when the Defence of your Country shall summon you to Action.</P>
<P>IF ever this Land stood in Need of wise and va∣liant Commanders, it is in the present Day.—Was there ever a Time, when we were encompass'd on all Sides, with such Numbers of Enemies?—Was there ever a Time, when such shocking Cruelties were
<PB N="20" REF="007749_0017_102DA83B13F59A98"/>
committed on the Frontiers of this, and the neigh∣bouring Colonies? The Sound of War is continually heard in our Streets, and our chosen Troops, are daily marching forth to <HI>jeopard their Lives in the high Places of the Field.</HI> God's Voice to us is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joel</HI> 3.9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>Prepare War; wake the mighty Man; let all the Men of War draw near; let them come up; beat your Plow-shares into Swords; and your Pruning-hooks into Spears.</HI></P>
<P>NO sooner was Peace proclaim'd, but <HI>France</HI> imme∣diately prepar'd for the Commencement of a new War, the first favourable Opportunity; and fix'd upon <HI>North-America</HI> to be the Scene of its earliest Triumphs. To accomplish their perfidious Schemes, they invaded our Lands, surrounded our English Settlements, with Forts from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South</HI>: They artfully debauch'd our <HI>Indian Allies</HI> from their Alle∣giance to the CROWN OF GREAT BRITAIN, and insi∣nuated themselves into their Affections, by the most villainous Falshoods. In Consequence of this— We now see numerous Tribes of different Languages, en∣tering our unwalled Villages, committing those Bar∣barities which are the Disgrace of human Nature— the Abhorrence of the civilized Word. These are the Policies of <HI>France</HI>— the Triumphs of a Prince, who absurdly stiles himself, The MOST CHRISTIAN KING.</P>
<P>YET, O Enemies of GREAT-BRITAIN! you live to this Day, you keep Possession of those Places you have usurp'd, in Violation of the most solemn Treaties. Christian Charity forbids me to form a Wish for your Destruction.—May you only be bro't to acknowledge the Perfidy of your Conduct, the Injustice of your Usurpations, and by the Tears of unfeigned Repen∣tance,
<PB N="21" REF="007749_0018_102DA83D9E8F41E8"/>
extinguish that War you have unhappily en∣kindled.</P>
<P>TILL God shall produce this happy Event, it be∣coms us. MY BRETHREN, to assert our Rights in eve∣ry lawful Method; and with unshaken Fortitude re∣sist the Injustice of our Enemies. When every Thing dear to us, as MEN,—ENGLISH-MEN— and CHRISTIANS, is in Danger, not to <HI>come out to the Help of the Lord against the Mighty</HI>▪ would be the most infamous Cowardise, and a melancholly Symptom of approaching Ruin.</P>
<P>WITH what Spirit you are to enter on this Work, I have represented in the preceeding Discourse.— Let it be your first Care to commit yourselves to the Pro∣tection of the blessed JESUS, whom <HI>God had given to be a Commander and Leader to the People.</HI> Adore His Grace— confide in His Merits— obey his sove∣reign Orders—Then with chearful Serenity, march wherever His Providence calls—Fear not the Power of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> — nor the confede∣rate Legions of the <HI>Prince of Darkness.</HI></P>
<P>THE Cause of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> shall fi∣nally prevail, notwithstanding all the Oppositions of <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Hell.</HI>—They that fall in the Combat, shall rise to a glorious Immortality. Faith in the <HI>Name of Christ,</HI> forbids your Fears amidst all the gloomy Horrors of War, and assures you the Victory in a future World.</P>
<P>This BLESSED <HI>Hope</HI> encouraged the happy Con∣querors in my Text, chearfully to endure the Diffi∣culties and Trials of their militant State; and kept them steady to the Cause of God and His People, in Times of the greatest Temptation.— <HI>They had Res∣pect to the Recompence of Reward, and look'd for a better Country, even an heavenly one.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="007749_0019_102DA83FA7D65188"/>LIFT up your Eyes, behold them seated upon ra∣diant Thrones— crown'd with unfading Honour— cloth'd with darling Robes—<HI>shining like Stars in the Firmament</HI> of Glory. Lo! they look down upon you, who are still encompassed with Enemies, and fighting <HI>the good Fight of Faith.</HI> They encourage you to go on, with invinsible Courage and Resolution. By their Example they assure you, that if you are <HI>faithful unto the Death, you also shall receive a</HI> CROWN OF LIFE.—</P>
<P>To which, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<CLOSER>AMEN.</CLOSER>
