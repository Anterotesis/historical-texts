<HEAD>A short and wonderful ACCOUNT OF THE Conversion of Three <HI>Jewish</HI> Chil∣dren to Christianity. <DATE><HI>BERLIN,</HI> Aug. <HI>the</HI> 10th. 1716.</DATE></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>BOUT three Weeks ago, <HI>three</HI> young <HI>Jewish</HI> Girls, whose Names were <HI>Sprintz, Guttel,</HI> and <HI>Esther,</HI> Daugh∣ters of <HI>Isaac Veits</HI> and <HI>Sophia Mos;es,</HI> Jews, came to the House of Mr. <HI>Kahman</HI> a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Minister of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Church in <HI>Berlin.</HI> The eldest of 'em was Twelve Years old; (tho' the Mother gives out she is but Nine:) The youngest was Eight, or, as the Mo∣ther pretends, but Six.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001974_0004_0FBA3CF8E7EFE468"/>These Children desir'd to speak with the Minister: As soon as he appeared, the eldest address'd her self to him first, and said: She with her two <HI>Sisters were come to request his Protection and Instructi∣on; for that they had a great Desire to em∣brace the Christian Religion, whereby they likewise might have Part in</HI> Jesus <HI>of</HI> Naza∣reth, <HI>the true God, who dyed for them, as well as for the rest of Mankind</HI>; adding, <HI>That the sincere and unfeigned Love to this crucified God, constrained them hereto; and that they could not possibly live any longer with their Parents.</HI></P>
<P>Mr· <HI>Kahman,</HI> the Minister, was much surprized at what he heard, and began to think they had, perhaps, met with some severe Usage at Home, which occasioned their speaking to him in this Manner: Wherefore he advis'd them to Return home again, and be hereafter more Obe∣dient to their Parents. But all three flung themselves down at his Feet, begging and intreating him, in the Name of <HI>JESƲS,</HI> whom they loved and adored, to receive them; declaring withal, That nothing in this World had moved them to forsake
<PB N="5" REF="001974_0005_0FBA3CFE40664F68"/>
their Parents House, but the sole View of becoming <HI>Christ</HI>'s chosen Ones, and to belong to Him alone; and that, Let Things go how they would with them, they were fully resolv'd <HI>rather to dye, than to leave their Jesus.</HI> Whereupon the Mi∣nister took them into his House.</P>
<P>The Parents having searched up and down for their Children a considerable Time in vain, came to hear at last they were at Mr. <HI>Kahman</HI>'s; to whom they went, and demanded their Children of him: He reply'd, he had sent already an Account of the Case of these Children to his Majesty the King of <HI>Prussia</HI>; and that it did not lie in his Power to deliver up the Children to them against their own Inclinations: However, he promised to say nothing to the Children▪ till he re∣ceived Orders from his Majesty concern∣ing them.</P>
<P>As soon as the King had received the Account, he appointed certain Commi∣ssioners, two of the <HI>Reformed,</HI> and two of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Perswasion, <HI>viz.</HI> the Reve∣rend Dr. <HI>Jablonski,</HI> Mr. <HI>Achenbach, Possard</HI> and <HI>Thering,</HI> with strict Orders, to make
<PB N="6" REF="001974_0006_0FBA3CFFA1056268"/>
an exact Enquiry into this Matter; and particularly to consider, whether these Children might be taken into his Ma∣jesty's Protection, in order to be brought up in the Christian Religion, against their Parents Consent, without infringing the Power that Parents have over their Chil∣dren, grounded on divine and humane Right.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Commissioners ordered the Children to be brought before them, and appointed the Parents, in the mean while, to go into another Room adjoin∣ing, where they might hear the whole Examination. Then they took the Chil∣dren, and examined them one after ano∣ther; who all, as with one Voice decla∣red, <HI>They would not return to their Parents again, but would be made Christians, and Children of Eternal Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>It appear'd, they could already say the <HI>Lord's-Prayer</HI> by Heart, as also several Texts out of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> with several Hymns: The youngest could also repeat the <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Christian Faith</HI>: All which, they said, they had learnt whilst they were at Play with Christian
<PB N="7" REF="001974_0007_0FBA3D012D8B2630"/>
Children. These they rehearsed with a wonderful Devotion; most solemnly pro∣testing, that they would never live nor die otherwise than Christians.</P>
<P>In order to try their Sincerity, the Reverend Persons entrusted with this Matter, omitted nothing to represent the Life of a Christian as <HI>Ʋneasy</HI> and <HI>Trou∣blesome</HI> as possibly they could: However, after having done this, and layed before them, on the one Side, how they would be despised and forsaken, even among the Christians themselves, and be forced to work hard for their Livelihood: They replied, That they would work <HI>till the very Blood spurted out from their Nails,</HI> provided they might be made Children of Eternal Salvation; [and that] though they should not be happy in this World, they hoped to be so in the next. And when it was represented to them, on the other Side, how easily and comfortably they might live among the <HI>Jews</HI>; and that their Father had made fine Cloaths for them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they reply'd, <HI>They did not value that at all; the Cloaths must remain in the World; they would be Children of Salva∣tion,
<PB N="8" REF="001974_0008_0FBA3D02AB556240"/>
and not return to their Parents again.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Parents were call'd in, and the Children being placed before them, they began to speak to them with abundance of Tenderness and Compassion; they fell upon their Necks, kiss'd their very Hands and Feet, and melted away into Tears.</P>
<P>The Children, not a little amazed hereat, declar'd with many Tears, they would become <HI>Christians,</HI> and not return to their Parents. The middlemost, in particular, as she was very much pressed by her Mother to go Home with her, answer'd: <HI>No! But you, Mother, ought rather to become a Christian also.</HI> They sought then to hide themselves behind the Ministers, who feigned to turn them off, saying:
<Q>They did very ill to for∣sake their Parents, who had such a ten∣der Love for them, who would make them many fine Presents, and had brought some along with them: That, on the contrary, they were to expect among <HI>Christians</HI> nothing but <HI>Crosses</HI> and <HI>Afflictions</HI>; they would hardly get enough to satisfy their Hunger; but,
<PB N="9" REF="001974_0009_0FBA3D041933D010"/>
in a Word, would be very Misera∣ble.</Q></P>
<P>The Parents being retir'd, and the Children once more earnestly entreated to return Home with them, but to no purpose; it was at last proposed, to them, That provided their Parents would also turn <HI>Christians,</HI> whether then they would be content to go along with them? To which they, with an uncommon Con∣stancy and Satisfaction, immediately an∣swer'd: That if their Parents would but become <HI>Christians</HI> too, they should be their Parents still, and then they would go back with them, and endure with them any Hardship or Tribulation; otherwise they would never return; for that they loved <HI>Jesus</HI> above all other Views, and would, with the highest Joy imaginable, take his Cross upon them, and follow him; saying, They might if they pleased, put them into a <HI>Spin-House,</HI> where they would be heartily willing to Labour: To which the youngest further added: If you will give me nothing, let me die of Hunger, or cut off my very Head; for I had rather lose my Life, than be separated from my dear∣est
<PB N="10" REF="001974_0010_0FBA3D15CB638ED0"/>
<HI>Jesus,</HI> who dy'd for me; and if you refuse to take me, he is always ready to receive me into his Arms. I will live and die with Him.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, that no Person present could forbear Weeping at the Firmness of these Children, whose Speech was as sound, as it was artless; particularly Dr. <HI>Jablonski,</HI> who has a deeper Knowledge in the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion than most others.</P>
<P>At last, their Parents were permitted to discourse with 'em alone, which they did for several Hours together; but the Children expressing all along the same Resolution, and prostrating themselves at last at the Feet of the Commissioners, they bid farewel to their Parents, that they might remain to <HI>Jesus</HI> alone, and said: <HI>That nothing had brought them thither but the Love of Jesus, and no manner of Reason should be powerful enough ever to di∣vide them from Him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>An Account of all this has been sent to his <HI>Prussian</HI> Majesty, whose Answer is daily expected. In the mean Time, the Commissioners have proposed, that these Children might be instructed publickly
<PB N="11" REF="001974_0011_0FBA3D1AEAC91060"/>
in the Church; and when they were thoroughly grounded in the Truth of the Christian Religion, that Leave should be given, not only to their Parents, but to any <HI>Jew</HI> that would come and hear them, to make what Objections they could, which should be answered by the Children so instructed.</P>
<P>The Baptizing of these Children will be deferr'd till they are more advanced in Age, that none may deny this to be the Work of God; and 'tis hoped, that this Affair, carried on after this Manner, will tend to the Edification of many other <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>These Children have such a tender Love for the very Name of <HI>JESƲS,</HI> that though they cannot as yet Read, never∣theless, knowing this Word, when they meet with it, they bow down upon it, and kiss it with a thousand Tears: And they will turn over whole Books to find this Name.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> They assured us, that several other Children were of the same Mind with themselves; but their Parents kept them close at Home; notwithstanding
<PB N="12" REF="001974_0012_0FBA3D1DA5F2EB88"/>
they did not doubt but they would find Means to escape: For the Love of <HI>JESƲS</HI> knew how to Counsel in all such Cases; and tho' the Parents should watch them never so narrowly, it would in the End signify nothing at all, which they three knew by their own Experience.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. AND now, First; How many Pious PARENTS are there, who are <HI>Travailing</HI> for the Souls of their <HI>Children,</HI> to see a CHRIST formed in them? They cannot see their <HI>Children walking in the Truth,</HI> but see them <HI>walking in the Vanity of their Minds</HI>; and the sight holds them in a painful, and inexpressible Anguish. They long, they long to see their Children <HI>Live unto God</HI>; and that they may be able to say, <HI>This Child was Dead, and is Alive again.</HI> My Friends, Hold on Praying, Weeping, Believing. Indeed, nothing less than an <HI>Almighty
<PB N="13" REF="001974_0013_0FBA3D1F178360F0"/>
Arm,</HI> can Change and Cleanse the <HI>Vici∣ous Hearts</HI> of the Ungodly Children. But the Holy SPIRIT, who is the <HI>Arm of the Lord,</HI> is no less than the Almighty GOD. Oh! Put those Obstinate Hearts into His Glorious and Almighty Hands. He can give an <HI>Astonishing Turn</HI> unto them. There is <HI>nothing too hard</HI> for Him. <HI>O Lord, I know, that thou canst do every thing</HI>! Believers, Behold what was done at <HI>Berlin,</HI> and be animated.</P>
<P N="2">II. But in the next place, How much may our Faith be now Encouraged, in the Expectation of the GREAT THINGS, which the Promises of our GOD have assured us, are to be done, for the Con∣verting of whole Nations, to <HI>come and Worship Him, and Glorify His Name</HI>? And more particularly, for the Conversion of the <HI>Israelitish Nation</HI>; when <HI>He that Scat∣tered Israel shall Gather him, and Keep him, as a Shepherd his Flock?</HI> There are many Good and Wise Men, who are Looking for the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> and those Influ∣ences from Heaven upon Earth, which will bring the Maxims of the EVER∣LASTING GOSPEL into a General, and
<PB N="14" REF="001974_0014_0FBA3D2C987CFF48"/>
an Amazing Operation upon a <HI>World</HI> that is now <HI>lying in Wickedness.</HI> The Intention of such Things as have been done at <HI>Ber∣lin</HI> (and elsewhere) is doubtless to let the Faithful see, a <HI>few Drops,</HI> that may Com∣fort their Hopes of the <HI>Mighty Showers,</HI> which GOD in His own Time, [when the <HI>Three Years and Six Months</HI> are Expi∣red!] will cause to fall upon the Chil∣dren of Men, and He comes <HI>to dwell with Men.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The Words of the Excellent Per∣son, who Writes the Preface to this Re∣markable at <HI>Berlin,</HI> are well worthy to be transcribed.</P>
<Q><P>The various Motions observed in se∣veral parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> tending to a Re∣vival of <HI>Sound and Substantial Piety,</HI> do presage the Approach of Better Times, and a fuller Measure of the Divine Spi∣rit promised to the Latter Days. But then the Intervening Night of the Judg∣ment of GOD, provoked by a long and continued Course of Sinning, will per∣haps destroy again the Flowers, which appear up and down on the Earth, and
<PB N="15" REF="001974_0015_0FBA3D2EC83374F0"/>
nip many a Tender Bud, which now begins to shoot forth. This ought, in no wise to Stagger the Faith of True Believers, but rather to Quicken it.</P>
<P>What Sweet and Heavenly Motions there have been particularly seen among many Children, in these Latter Years, doth appear from the seveaal Treatises published on that Account.— Particu∣larly, whole Numbers of Children in <HI>Silesia.</HI>— All these Motions are but so many <HI>Glimpses,</HI> that Glance indeed at a Larger Power of Spiritual Gifts and Graces. But then, they wear off again, after a while, and leave an Industrious Observer of such <HI>Signs,</HI> in a Pious Ex∣pectation of those Richer Incomes of Grace, which shall succeed? They are the <HI>First-Fruits</HI> of the Spirit, and an <HI>Earnest</HI> of a more Glorious Dispensation which shall follow in the Fulness of Time. They ought therefore to Sup∣port the Hopes of those that wait for the Manifestation of the Kingdom of CHRIST.</P></Q>
<P N="4"><PB N="16" REF="001974_0016_0FBA3D32C4D4B5A8"/>IV. How is it possible to publish the Relation of the <HI>Jewish Children</HI> at <HI>Berlin,</HI> without an Address unto the <HI>Jewish Na∣tion</HI>; and a Tender unto them, of <HI>Things that should be more thought upon</HI>?</P>
<P>If but one Soul of all that <HI>Beloved Peo∣ple,</HI> should be found, and reach'd, and touch'd, by the Things to be now laid before them, it will be well worth all the Pains of these Expostulations. It may be, the same <HI>Spirit,</HI> who wrought upon the Babes at <HI>Berlin,</HI> will fall upon some of that <HI>Beloved People,</HI> while they have these Words before them. We will <HI>Pro∣phesy over these Dry Bones,</HI> and see what <HI>the Spirit of Life</HI> will do upon them!</P>
<P>What Considerations are there, which would mightily Convince them, that they do <HI>they know not what themselves,</HI> in their <HI>Infidelity</HI>; and which, <HI>Men and Brethren,</HI> Oh! that you would <HI>shew your selves Men,</HI> and suffer them to awaken you.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001974_0017_0FBA3D3610C5BB50"/>When that <HI>Just One,</HI> whom your Fa∣thers <HI>took, and with Wicked Hands did Cru∣cify,</HI> was offering up His Life unto His Eternal Father on the Cross, the first Thing he there uttered, was that mar∣vellous Expression of Charity and Com∣passion for you; [That horrid <HI>Herod,</HI> whom some of your People flattered with <HI>Messiah-ship,</HI> when he was dying was far from treating your People so:] Luk. XXIII. 34. <HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI> And many of them, were a few Days after, brought unto <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Forgiven.</HI> Syrs, You <HI>know not what you do,</HI> in your Infidelity. You little imagine that you Blaspheme and Reject the <HI>pro∣mised MESSIAH</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>only SAVIOƲR</HI> of the World, in the Indig∣nities, which our Blessed JESUS conti∣nues to suffer from you. I know you do it <HI>Ignorantly in Ʋnbelief</HI>: But we are Waiting and Longing for the approaching Time. <HI>Ah! Lord how long?</HI>— when you shall <HI>obtain that Mercy,</HI> to be Recovered out of your <HI>Ʋnbelief</HI>; and He that is now (but will then be much more so) the <HI>Light of the Gentiles,</HI> will then be (and they shall
<PB N="18" REF="001974_0018_0FBA3D3748EBEF80"/>
be most sensible of His being so) the <HI>Glory of His People Israel. Joseph</HI> was not known to his Brethren, at the <HI>first</HI> Interview: Anon there came a <HI>Second,</HI> at which he made himself known unto them. In the mean Time, your <HI>Infidelity,</HI> wherein you cast so many <HI>Ignorant Reproaches</HI> on Him, does Confirm our <HI>Faith</HI> of this Glorious JESUS, and Commend Him the more to our Love, our Praise, and our Adoration. It was foretold by your Prophets, [Isa. LIII. 2, 3. That when you should first <HI>see your</HI> MESSIAH, you should <HI>see no Beauty in Him that you should desire Him</HI>; and that He should be <HI>Despised and Rejected</HI> among you; and that you would <HI>hide your Faces</HI> from Him, <HI>Despise</HI> Him, and not <HI>Esteem</HI> Him. It was foretold, [Psal. LXIX. 21, 22, 23, 15, 28.] That you would <HI>Reproach</HI> Him, and give Him <HI>Gall for His Meat,</HI> and <HI>Vinegar for His Drink</HI>; and that there∣upon your <HI>Table</HI> should become your <HI>Snare,</HI> and you be Ensnared by your Besiegers, at your <HI>Passover</HI>; and that your Eyes then should be <HI>Darkned,</HI> as now they are, and your <HI>Habitation Desolate</HI>; and that you should be <HI>blotted out of the Book of the Liv∣ing,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="001974_0019_0FBA3D4175D236A8"/>
and your <HI>Genealigies</HI> be no longer pre∣served among you. It was foretold, [Dan. IX. 26. That about five hundred Years, after the Return from the <HI>Babylonish Cap∣tivity,</HI> the Messiah should come, and be <HI>Cut off,</HI> and then a People should <HI>Come,</HI> and <HI>Destroy the City and the Sanctuary</HI> and it should be <HI>made Desolate,</HI> by their <HI>Abo∣minable Armies.</HI> Yea, and it was foretold by our JESUS, whom to your Cost, you find a <HI>true Prophet</HI> of God, even in this <HI>Obstinacy</HI> of yours, which does refuse to account Him so! [Luk. XIX. 43.] That the <HI>Enemies</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> should straitly Be∣siege it, and lay it <HI>even with the Ground,</HI> and not <HI>leave one Stone upon another</HI> in it. And, [Luk. XXI. 24.] That your People should <HI>Fall by the Edge of the Sword,</HI> and be <HI>led away Captives into all Nations</HI>; and <HI>Jerusalem shall be Trodden down of the Gen∣tiles, until Times of the Gentiles,</HI> and their Fourth Monarchy, now near Expired, <HI>be fulfilled.</HI> And, [Joh. V. 43.] That tho' you Rejected <HI>Him,</HI> yet there would shortly <HI>come One in His own Name,</HI> a <HI>Bar-chochab,</HI> whom you <HI>would Receive</HI>; and thereby bring upon your selves the last Confusion.
<PB N="20" REF="001974_0020_0FBA3D4261753750"/>
The <HI>Veil</HI> of <HI>Infidelity,</HI> with the <HI>Chains of Darkness,</HI> holding you in the <HI>Dispersion</HI> wherein you <HI>abide many Days,</HI> must accor∣ding to those Ancient Prophesies, conti∣nue upon your Nation, until the <HI>Deter∣mined Period.</HI> But now and then there comes in One of your Nation, whom God Enlightens with the Knowledge of the <HI>Redeemer</HI>; and makes part of those <HI>First-Fruits,</HI> which will e're long be followed with a mighty <HI>Harvest,</HI> when the <HI>Redeemer shall come unto Zion,</HI> and shall <HI>turn</HI> His whole favoured and preserved Name <HI>from Ʋngodliness.</HI> The <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> of doing some Service of this Tendency, causes me now to say, <HI>Come now, and let us Reason together,</HI> upon a Point, which, O Reason∣able Souls, your Everlasting Salvation turns upon. And, <HI>O Eternal and Almighty Spi∣rit of God; Wilt thou Graciously open the Eyes of the Blind, in thy long Abdicated Na∣tion, and cause them with a Mournful Re∣pentance, to see and know the JEHOVAH whom they have pierced, and effectually Per∣swade them to hearken unto Reason, that so their Sins which are like Scarlet, may be White like Snow, and tho' they have been Red
<PB N="21" REF="001974_0021_0FBA3D4A6BE63C48"/>
as Crimson, they may be as Wool. Oh! Per∣swade them to Repent and be Converted, that so their Sins may be blotted out, and the Times of Refreshing may come from the Presence of the Lord!</HI></P>
<P>Brethren, You are <HI>Scandalized</HI> at the <HI>Cross</HI> of our JESUS: It <HI>Scandalizes</HI> you, that such a <HI>Suffering</HI> and <HI>Abased</HI> JESUS, ever should be your SAVIOUR. But was it not expresly Foretold concerning the MESSIAH, That He should suffer <HI>Stripes,</HI> and be <HI>Oppressed,</HI> and <HI>Afflicted,</HI> and be brought as a <HI>Lamb to the Slaughter,</HI> and be <HI>Bruised,</HI> and be <HI>put unto Grief,</HI> and have His Soul made a <HI>Trespass-Offering</HI>? You find all this, and much more, in the <HI>Fifty-third</HI> Chapter of your <HI>Isaiah</HI>'s Prophecies: A <HI>Chapter</HI> which has been blessed of God, for the Conversion of many in your Na∣tion; and indeed, it is to be wondred at, how any of you can shut your Eyes against the Light of so Bright a <HI>Chapter</HI>! I be∣seech you, Syrs, to Read it over again. It is most certain, that if the MESSIAH be not <HI>already come,</HI> yet whenever He does come, He must appear in <HI>just such,</HI> I say, <HI>just such</HI> Circumstances of Humiliation, as
<PB N="22" REF="001974_0022_0FBA3D4BF9BC6540"/>
those for which your most Lovely JESUS is now disliked among you. Yea, you your selves have your Tradition, concerning a <HI>Suffering Messiah</HI>; and you speak of His <HI>Griefs,</HI> as the Greatest that any Son of Man can ever meet withal: Things most Marvellously accomplished in our JESUS! I pray, Syrs, consider of it. All your Peo∣ple have consented unto that Word of God, Deut. XXVII. 26. <HI>Cursed is he that Confirmeth not all the Words of this Law, to do them.</HI> Now, 'tis Evident, that not One of you have <HI>Done all Things</HI> required in the <HI>Law</HI>; and <HI>Continued</HI> in the Doing of them. You are every One of you chargeable with many Violations of the <HI>Law</HI>: It were easy to Convince you of them; yea, where is the Man so Vain, so Proud, so Foolish, as not to own, <HI>I am a Sinner!</HI> You then lye Obnoxious to the terrible Curse of God, which will shut out all the Wretched Objects of it, from all the <HI>Ble∣ssedness of the Righteous.</HI> You cannot avoid this tremendous <HI>Curse,</HI> but by presenting before your Holy GOD, a sufficient <HI>Sacri∣fice</HI> to make Expiation for your Offences, and Vindicate the Honour of that Glori∣ous
<PB N="23" REF="001974_0023_0FBA3D4CF2F33680"/>
<HI>Law</HI> against which you have Offended. <HI>Obedience for the Time to come,</HI> will not be a <HI>Reparation</HI> for your <HI>past Injuries</HI> to the <HI>Law,</HI> in those Miscarriages by which you have <HI>denied the God that is Above.</HI> It will not be a <HI>Perfect Obedience:</HI> This you find by <HI>Woful Experience</HI>; when you have done your <HI>Best,</HI> you will still again, and again Miscarry. And if it could be <HI>Perfect,</HI> it will be no more than you would have <HI>Ow'd</HI> if you had never <HI>Sinn'd.</HI> The Payment of <HI>this Debt,</HI> would not Cancel that other of <HI>Punishment,</HI> which your <HI>Former Sins</HI> have Contracted, and wherein you stand oblig'd unto the <HI>Justice</HI> of God. <HI>Repentance for what is past,</HI> will not be an <HI>Attonement.</HI> For, if that would have done, why was any <HI>Sa∣crifice,</HI> or something <HI>Punished</HI> and <HI>Consumed</HI> by the <HI>Curse</HI> of God falling with a <HI>Fiery In∣dignation</HI> upon it, is by the Demand of <HI>Di∣vine Justice</HI> become <HI>Necessary,</HI> when the <HI>Sin</HI> which does Expose unto it, has been Com∣mitted? And, O Miserables, what will you now do, that you may Enjoy the Benefit of such a <HI>Sacrifice</HI>? By being deprived of your <HI>Temple,</HI> and banished from your <HI>City,</HI> you are left utterly Destitute of your An∣cient

<HI>Sacrifices.</HI> The Prediction, [Dan. IX. 27.] That the <HI>Messiah</HI> at His coming, should <HI>cause the Sacrifice and Oblation to cease</HI> among you, has been in that very Dreadful Way, most wonderfully Accomplished. And if you could have <HI>them,</HI> yet you fall into ma∣ny <HI>Presumpteous Sins,</HI> for which there were no <HI>Sacrifices</HI> provided and appointed in the Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> What will you do, when you fall into a <HI>Guiltiness,</HI> for which the <HI>Law desired not any Sacrifices, nor delighted in any Burnt-Offerings?</HI> The MESSIAH, who was promised from the Beginning, under the Character of the <HI>Broken,</HI> the <HI>Contrite,</HI> the <HI>Bruised</HI> one, is your only <HI>Refuge.</HI> Your <HI>Da∣vid</HI> in such a Case found Him so. [Psal. LI. 16, 17.] Every Thing without Him, will be <HI>Despised of God.</HI> Nor indeed, can you imagine, that the mean <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Fowls,</HI> and the <HI>Flock,</HI> and the <HI>Herd,</HI> could yield <HI>Sacrifices</HI> proportionable to the <HI>Majesty</HI> of the Great GOD, and the Quality of the <HI>High-Treason</HI> which there is in every Tres∣pass against such a <HI>Majesty.</HI> No, The An∣cient <HI>Sacrifices</HI> all pointed you, to <HI>that</HI> which you must be constrained now to make the only Retreat of your distressed

Souls. When the Believers of Old, leaned their <HI>Hands</HI> on the <HI>Heads</HI> of the <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of that <HI>Laying on of Hands,</HI> &amp; the Thing they intended in it, was a <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Messiah</HI> who was to come, and be in like Manner <HI>Sacrificed</HI> for us. You must have a <HI>Sacrificed Messiah</HI> to live upon; or else you <HI>Dye in your Sins,</HI> and perish Miserably. Your <HI>Messiah</HI> can do nothing for you, unless by a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> He Reconcile you to God, and so deliver you from the <HI>Curse</HI> to which your Sins have exposed you. Nor will any <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> but that of Himself, be accepted with God. You Read, [Isa. LIII. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.] <HI>It pleased the Lord to Bruise Him, and put Him to Grief, and make His Soul a Trespass-Offer∣ing.</HI> A <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> which the more you consi∣der, the more you will see all Interests most admirably Provided for! So then, The <HI>Messiah</HI> must at first come, in such <HI>Obsturity,</HI> that he may undergo <HI>Bitter Ago∣nies,</HI> &amp; have His most precious <HI>Blood</HI> pou∣red out, and have the most horrid <HI>Punish∣ment of Sinners</HI> inflicted on Him All, just exactly, <HI>just exactly!</HI> as our JESUS was dealt withal! Why then, Oh! why should you <HI>look for another</HI>! And why should the
<PB N="26" REF="001974_0026_0FBA3D55FA9BD478"/>
<HI>Cross</HI> be the <HI>Stumbling-block,</HI> in the Way of your <HI>Faith</HI> on our JESUS! A <HI>Cross</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Invites</HI> you to such a suitable Savi∣our! A <HI>Cross</HI> which even <HI>Assures</HI> you, that <HI>He</HI> is, and none but <HI>He</HI> can be your Savi∣our! Hundreds of <HI>Jews,</HI> have in our Days, been brought over to <HI>Christianity,</HI> by the Blessing of God, on this One irresistible Argument, managed by one Renowned Convert from <HI>Judaism,</HI> in the City of <HI>Ham∣burgh.</HI> Oh! that all they, who find them∣selves unable to answer this Argument, would be so Wise, as to submit unto the <HI>Right Words</HI> which are so <HI>Forcible!</HI> Indeed, this Consideration, That when the MES∣SIAH comes, it must be <HI>just exacty</HI> in such Circumstances, as those wherein our Ble∣ssed JESUS (Oh! why not <HI>yours</HI>?) exhibi∣ted Himself unto your Fathers, is further <HI>Enforced</HI>; and it will be seen extended unto so many surprizing Instances, that we shall be able to see nothing short of a Miracu∣lous Infliction, in your uncured and persi∣sting <HI>Infidelity.</HI> What can be more Evident than this, [Gen. XLIX. 10.] That the Jewish Nation should not be without (ei∣ther <HI>Scepter</HI> or <HI>Lawgivers)</HI> greater or lesser

Magistrates of their own, till the <HI>Peace-giving Saviour</HI> should come? And, [Mal. III. 2. Hag. II. 9.] that the <HI>Messiah</HI> should come, while your <HI>Second Temple</HI> was yet standing; and so, a <HI>greater Glory</HI> be <HI>there,</HI> than there was in the former? And, [Dan. IX. 25, 26] That the <HI>Messiah</HI> should come within five hundred Years, after the <HI>going forth of the Commandment to Restore and Rebuild Jerusalem</HI>? So then, the <HI>Messiah</HI> must come <HI>just exactly</HI> at such a <HI>Time</HI> as our JESUS came! And at the very <HI>Place</HI> too; (Mic. V. 2.) <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> which is now extinguished. In looking for <HI>Another,</HI> you look for One in whom it is impossible for the Prophesies of the <HI>Messiah</HI> to be answer∣ed. The coming of the <HI>Messiah</HI> was not promised on any <HI>Condition</HI> of your deserv∣ing such a Favour; the Promise was not suspended on any Merits of yours; it was a Blessing which <HI>tarrieth not for Man, nor waiteth for the Sons of Men.</HI> Your Expecta∣tion of <HI>Another,</HI> is nothing less than a <HI>Blasphemy</HI> against the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of the Glorious God. But <HI>God will be True,</HI> and <HI>every Man</HI> will be <HI>found a Lyar,</HI> who says, That the <HI>Messiah</HI> did not come, at the
<PB N="28" REF="001974_0028_0FBA3D58E4855998"/>
<HI>Time</HI> which the Faithful God, had in His Oracles prefixed for it. Nay, you cannot mention any one Thing, in the <HI>Circum∣stances</HI> of our JESUS, but what you may find predicted in the ancient <HI>Prophesies</HI> of the <HI>Messiah:</HI> Nor was there any one thing in those ancient <HI>Prophesies</HI> foretold of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> but in the <HI>Circumstances</HI> of our JESUS, you find it marvellously Answer∣ed. All <HI>just exactly</HI> as it should be! <HI>The Spirit of Prophecy,</HI> has given such a <HI>Testi∣mony</HI> for our JESUS, that you cannot re∣fuse Him, without fulfilling another of His <HI>Oracles,</HI> which long since declared what you should be left unto; [Isa. XLIII. 10, 17.] <HI>To Rebel, and Vex the Holy Spirit,</HI> so that He <HI>turns to be your Enemy</HI>; He no more visits you; He leaves you to <HI>Err from His Ways,</HI> &amp; your <HI>Hearts are hardened from His Fear.</HI> But that which one would think, should give a <HI>final Stroke</HI> to your <HI>Infidelity,</HI> and eternally <HI>Bruise the Head</HI> of the <HI>Croo∣ked Serpent,</HI> would be this; The RESUR∣RECTION of our JESUS from the Dead. Your Countrymen said, <HI>If He will come down from the Cross, we will Believe on Him</HI>! Syrs, If He <HI>come up from the Grave,</HI> will not

this do as well? For an <HI>Holy One</HI> to come, with Maxims all evidently Calculated for the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> and say, <HI>I am the Son of God Incarnate, and my Sacrifice to God is the only Atonement that can be made for your Sins, and if you put your selves under my Conduct, I will bring you to everlasting Life. To prove all this, I will Dye, you shall put me to Death; and on the Third Day I will Rise from the Dead.</HI> This being accomplished in our JE∣SUS, Oh! what can you reasonably desire more, to make you fall down, and cry out, <HI>Lord, we Believe and are Sure, that thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God</HI>? You your selves do in your most Celebrated Writings confess, That if JESUS be in∣deed <HI>Risen from the Dead,</HI> He is One, whom you ought all to hearken to, and that He may claim a Power to supersede any of the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Institutions. Indeed the Men of <HI>Ninive,</HI> who hearkened unto a <HI>Jonah,</HI> af∣ter he had come alive out of the Belly of the Fish, will condemn those who have not hearkened unto a <HI>Jesus,</HI> who comes up alive out of the Belly of the Earth, on the Third Day after he had been buried there. Now, that our JESUS is <HI>Risen from the
<PB N="30" REF="001974_0030_0FBA3D6051FF3938"/>
Dead,</HI> is a <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> which has been Attested with as <HI>infallible Proofs,</HI> as ever any Matter that was in the World. After His <HI>Resurrection,</HI> He appeared no less than <HI>Ten Times,</HI> and unto no less than <HI>five Hun∣dred</HI> at one Time. These <HI>chosen Witnesses,</HI> conversed with Him, and satisfied all their Senses, that they were not imposed upon. They gave their Testimony in such a man∣ner, so Consistently, so Coherently, with such a Conduct, as to shew, that they were no <HI>Senseless Idiots.</HI> They willingly ex∣posed themselves to such cruel Sufferings for their Testimony, as to shew, that it was not a <HI>Cunningly devised Fable,</HI> which they now put upon the World. One of His Disciples, who <HI>Denied</HI> Him just before His Death, presently appeared, as one of the most famous Witnesses to His <HI>Resur∣rection from the Dead.</HI> Had it not really happened, you may be sure this Man would have gone on, as you do, (But now, Oh! do it no more!) in the Denial of Him. Their <HI>Holy,</HI> and <HI>Righteous,</HI> and <HI>Blameless</HI> Conversation, shewed, that they were no <HI>Impostors.</HI> Yea, God from Heaven testified for them, and wondrously confirmed their
<PB N="31" REF="001974_0031_0FBA3D61F67EE5B0"/>
Testimony, by the <HI>Miraculous Gifts</HI> He bestowed upon them. You Affirm it, and very truly, That your <HI>Elijah</HI> was carried up into the Heavens. There was <HI>but One</HI> to Witness it: But you say, and this very truly too, That this <HI>One</HI> was a very Good Man, a Prophet of God, and a Worker of <HI>Miracles,</HI> and One owned of God, as he would not have been, if he had been a <HI>For∣ger of Lies.</HI> We affirm, That our JESUS Ascended up into the Heavens. There was a considerable Number of Men to Witness this. And these were all good Men, and Prophets of God, and Workers of <HI>Miracles.</HI> There is no Truth in any History upon Earth, if they did not often Speak the <HI>Great Things of God,</HI> with the <HI>Tongues of An∣gels</HI>; in <HI>Tongues</HI> which they never had Learnt, but now had them under Angeli∣cal Inspiration; and if they did not Mira∣culously Heal the <HI>Sick,</HI> the <HI>Blind,</HI> and the <HI>Lame,</HI> and <HI>Raise the Dead.</HI> God would never have done such Things for the <HI>For∣gers of a Lye.</HI> And then, utterly to over∣whelm your <HI>Infidelity,</HI> by casting a Pon∣derous Mountain upon it: The <HI>Spirit</HI> of God gave a marvellous Blessing to the
<PB N="32" REF="001974_0032_0FBA3D6362349398"/>
<HI>Faith</HI> of a Risen JESUS: He so Blesses it, where it is cordially Entertained, that it fills the Souls of Men, with unspeakable <HI>Goodness.</HI> It causes them to Love God, &amp; Live unto Him, in all the most shining Instances of Lovely Piety. It causes them to treat their Neighbours with a most sin∣cere Love, &amp; a very Charming Benignity. It causes them to sleight this World, and hate and shun every vitious Thing in the World: Fills them with <HI>Heaven,</HI> and fits them for it. The People are actually <HI>Sa∣ved</HI> who are made partakers of these things. 'Tis the <HI>Faith</HI> of a <HI>Risen JESƲS,</HI> which is attended with such a <HI>Saving Efficacy.</HI> Our JESUS has herein already proved a <HI>Savi∣our</HI> unto Multitudes, whom He has made the <HI>Excellent in the Earth.</HI> It follows, that He is THE <HI>Saviour.</HI> Oh! That you would at last make the happy Experiment! <HI>Come and see</HI>; see, see, whether you do not find Him so! Do not go on under the <HI>Blind∣ness that has happened</HI> unto you, to treat Him as your <HI>Enemy,</HI> who is your only <HI>Saviour. Oh! That they were Wise, and would consider their Latter End.</HI></P>
