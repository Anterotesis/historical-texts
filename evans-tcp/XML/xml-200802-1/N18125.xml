<HEAD>The Rights of Conscience inalienable, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are <HI>four</HI> principles contended for, as the foundation of civil government, viz. Birth, property, grace, and compact. The <HI>first</HI> of these is practised upon in all hereditary monarchies; where it is believed that the son of a monarch is entitled to dominion, upon the decease of his father, whether he be a wise man or a fool. The <HI>second</HI> principle is built upon, in all aristocratical govern∣ments, where the rich landholders have the sole rule of all their tenants; and make laws, at plea∣sure, which are binding upon all. The <HI>third</HI> prin∣ciple is adopted by those kingdoms and states, that require a religious test to qualify an officer of state; proscribing all non-conformists from civil and re∣ligious liberty. This was the error of Constantine's government, who first established the christian re∣ligion
<PB N="4" REF="023495_0003_0FBFA250AF60E030"/>
by law, and then proscribed the Pagans, and banished the <HI>Arian hereticks.</HI> This error also filled the heads of the anabaptists in Germany (who were re-sprinklers.) They supposed that none had right to rule but gracious men. The same error prevails in the See of Rome, where his Holiness exalts himself above all who are called God's, (i. e. kings and rulers) and where no protestant here∣tick is allowed the liberty of a citizen. This prin∣ciple is also plead for in the Ottoman Empire; where it is death to call in question the divinity of Mahomed, or the authenticity of the Alcoran.</P>
<P>The same evil has twisted itself into the British form of government; where, in the state establish∣ment of the church of England, no man is eligible to any office, civil or military, without he sub∣scribes to the 39 articles and book of common prayer; and even then, upon receiving a commis∣sion for the army, the law obliges him to receive the sacrament of the Lord's-supper: and no non-conformist is allowed the liberty of his conscience, without he subscribes to all the 39 articles but about four. And when that is done, his purse-strings are drawn by others, to pay preachers, in whom he puts no confidence, and whom he never hears.</P>
<P>This was the case of several of the Southern States (until the revolution), in which the church of England was established.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> principle (compact) is adopted in the American States, as the basis of civil government. —This foundation appears to be a just one, by the following investigation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="023495_0004_0FBFA2526975EFF8"/>Suppose a man to remove to a desolate island, and take a peaceable possession of it, without injuring any; so that he should be the honest inheritor of the isle. So long as he is alone he is the absolute mo∣narch of the place; and his own will is his law; which law, is as often altered or repealed as his will changes. In process of time, from this man's loins ten sons are grown to manhood, and possess pro∣perty. So long as they are all good men, each one can be as absolute, free, and sovereign as his father: but one of the ten turns vagrant, by robbing the rest. This villain is equal to, if not an over-match for any one of the nine: not one of them durst engage him, in single combat. Reason and safety both dictate to the nine, the necessity of a confed∣eration, to unite their strength together to repel or destroy the plundering knave. Upon entering into confederation, some <HI>compact</HI> or agreement would be stipulated, by which each would be bound to do his equal part in fatigue and expence. It would be necessary for these nine to meet at stated times, to consult means of safety and happiness. A shady tree or small cabbin, would answer their purpose: and in case of disagreement, 4 must give up to 5.</P>
<P>In this state of things, their government would be perfectly democratical; every citizen being a le∣gislator.</P>
<P>In a course of years, from these nine, there arises nine thousand: their government can be no longer democratical—prudence would forbid it. Each tribe or district, must then chuse their representative, who (for the term that he is chosen) has the whole po∣litical
<PB N="6" REF="023495_0005_0FBFA259704E5D10"/>
power of his constituents. These represen∣tatives, meeting in assembly, would have power to make laws, binding on their constituents; and while their time was spent in making laws for the com∣munity, each one of the community must advance a little of his money as a compensation therefor.— Should these representatives differ in judgement, the minor must be subject to the major, as in the case above.</P>
<P>From this simple parable, the following things are demonstrated.</P>
<P>1. That the law was not made for a righteous man, but for the disobedient. 2. That righteous men have to part with a little of their liberty and property to preserve the rest. 3. That all power is vested in, and consequently derived from the people. 4. That the law should rule over rulers, and not rulers over the law. 5. That government is foun∣ded on <HI>compact.</HI> 6. That every law made by the le∣gislators, inconsistent with the <HI>compact,</HI> modernly called a constitution, is usurpive in the legislators, and not binding on the people. 7. That whenever government is found inadequate to preserve the li∣berty, and property of the people, they have an indubitable right to alter it, so as to answer those purposes. 8. That legislators, in their legislative capacity, cannot alter the constitution, for they are hired servants of the people, to act within the lim∣its of the constitution.</P>
<P>From these general observations, I shall pass on to examine a question, which has been the strife and
<PB N="7" REF="023495_0006_0FBFA25D471B0FB0"/>
contention of ages.—The question is, <HI>"Are the Rights of Conscience alienable, or inalienable?"</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>conscience,</HI> signifies <HI>common science,</HI> a court of judicature which the Almighty has erected in every human breast: a <HI>censor morum</HI> over all his conduct. Conscience will ever judge right, when it is rightly informed; and speak the truth when it understands it. But to advert to the question, <Q>Does a man, upon entering into social compact, surrender his conscience to that society, to be con∣troled by the laws thereof; or can he, in justice, assist in making laws to bind his children's consci∣ences before they are born?</Q> I judge not, for the following reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Every man must give an account of himself to God, and therefore every man ought to be at liberty to serve God in that way that he can best reconcile it to his conscience. If Government, can answer for Individuals at the day of judgement, let men be con∣troled by it, in religious matters; otherwise, let men be free.</P>
<P N="2">2. It would be sinful for a man to surrender that to man, which is to be kept sacred for God. A man's mind should be always open to conviction; and an honest man will receive that doctrine which appears the best demonstrated: and what is more common than for the best of men to change their minds? Such are the prejudices of the mind, and such the force of tradition, that a man who never alters his mind, is either very weak or very stubborn. How painful then must it be to an honest heart, to be bound to
<PB N="8" REF="023495_0007_0FBFA25E5891C798"/>
observe the principles of his former belief, after he is convinced of their imbecility? and this ever has, and ever will be the case, while the rights of con∣science are considered alienable.</P>
<P N="3">3. But supposing it was right for a man to bind his own conscience, yet surely it is very iniquitous to bind the consciences of his children—to make fetters for them before they are born, is very cruel. And yet such has been the conduct of men in almost all ages, that their children have been bound to be∣lieve and worship as their fathers did, or suffer shame, loss, and sometimes life; and at best, to be called dis∣senters; because they dissent from that which they never joined voluntarily. Such conduct in parents, is worse than that of the father of <HI>Hannibal,</HI> who imposed an oath upon his son, while a child, never to be at peace with the Romans.</P>
<P N="4">4. Finally, religion is a matter between God and individuals: religious opinions of men not being the objects of civil government, nor any ways under its control.</P>
<P>It has often been observed, by the friends of reli∣gious establishment by human laws, that no state can long continue without it; that religion will perish, and nothing but infidelity and atheism prevail.</P>
<P>Are these things facts?—Did not the christian re∣ligion prevail during the three first centuries, in a more glorious manner than ever it has since; not on∣ly without the aid of law, but in opposition to all the laws of haughty monarchs? And did not religion receive a deadly wound by being fostered in the arms of civil power and regulated by law? These things are so.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="023495_0008_0FBFA2602FAB2BB8"/>From that day to this, we have but a few instan∣ces of religious liberty to judge by; for in almost all states, civil rulers (by the instigation of covetous priests) have undertaken to steady the ark of reli∣gion, by human laws; but yet we have a few of them, without leaving our own land.</P>
<P>The state of Rhode-Island has stood above 160 years without any religious establishment. The state of New-York never had any. New-Jersey claims the same. Pennsylvania has also stood from its first settlement until now upon a liberal foun∣dation: and if agriculture, the mechanical arts and commerce have not flourished in these states, equal to any of the states, I judge wrong.</P>
<P>It may further be observed, that all the states now in union, saving two or three in New-Eng∣land, have no legal force used about religion, in directing its course or supporting its preachers.— And moreover, the federal government is forbidden by the constitution, to make any laws, establishing any kind of religion. If religion cannot stand, therefore, without the aid of law, it is likely to fall soon, in our nation, except in Connecticut and Massachusetts.</P>
<P>To say, that "Religion cannot stand without a state establishment," is not only contrary to fact, (as has been proved already) but is a contradiction in phrase. Religion must have stood a time before any law could have been made about it; and if it did stand almost 300 years without law, it can still stand without it.</P>
<P>The evils of such an establishment are many.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="023495_0009_0FBFA262B53C3838"/>1. Uninspired, fallible men make their own o∣pinions tests of orthodoxy, and use their own syst∣ems, as <HI>Rocrustus</HI> used his iron bedstead; to stretch and measure the consciences of all others by.— Where no toleration is granted to non-conformists, either ignorance and superstition prevail, or perse∣cution rages: and if toleration is granted to re∣stricted non-conformists, the minds of men are biassed, to embrace that religion which is favored and pampered by law, (and thereby hypocrisy is nourished) while those who cannot stretch their consciences to believe any thing and every thing in the established creed, are treated with contempt and opprobrious names; and by such means some are pampered to death by largesses, and others con∣fined from doing what good, they otherwise could, by penury. The first lie under a temptation to flatter the ruling party, to continue that form of government, which brings them in the sure bread of idleness; the last to despise that government, and those rulers that oppress them.—The first have their eyes shut to all further light, that would alter the religious machine, the last are always seeking new light, and often fall into enthusiasm. Such are the natural evils of establishment in re∣ligion by human laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such establishments not only wean and alien∣ate the affections of one from another, on account of the different usages they receive, in their religious sentiments, but are also very impolitic, especially in new countries; for what encouragement can stran∣gers
<PB N="11" REF="023495_0010_0FBFA2662153A590"/>
have to migrate with their arts and wealth into a state, where they cannot enjoy their reli∣gious sentiments without exposing themselves to the law? when, at the same time, their religious opinions do not lead them to be mutinous. And further, how often have kingdoms and states been greatly weak∣ened by religious tests! In the time of the persecu∣tion in France, not less than twenty thousand peo∣ple fled, for the enjoyment of religious liberty.</P>
<P N="3">3. These establishments, metamorphise the church into a creature, and religion into a principle of state; which has a natural tendency to make men conclude that <HI>bible religion</HI> is nothing but a <HI>trick of state</HI>: hence it is that the greatest part of the well informed in literature, are over-run with deism and infidelity; nor is it likely that it will ever be much better, while preaching is made a trade of emolument. And if there is no difference between <HI>bible religion</HI> and <HI>state religion,</HI> I shall soon fall into infidelity.</P>
<P N="4">4. There are no two kingdoms and states that establish the same creed and formularies of faith, (which alone proves their debility). In one king∣dom a man is condemned for not believing a doct∣rine that he would be condemned for believing in another kingdom. Both of these establishments can∣not be right—but both of them can be, and surely are, wrong.</P>
<P N="5">5. The nature of such establishments, further is, to keep from civil office, the best of men. Good men
<PB N="12" REF="023495_0011_0FBFA26EA7B106A8"/>
cannot believe what they cannot believe; and they will not subscribe to what they disbelieve; and take an oath to maintain what they conclude is error: and as the best of men differ in judgement, there may be some of them in any state: their talents and virtue entitle them to fill the most important posts, yet because they differ from the established creed of the state, they cannot—will not fill those posts▪ Whereas villains make no scruple to take any oath.</P>
<P>If these, and many more evils, attend such estab∣lishments, What were, and still are the causes that ever there should be a state establishment of religion in any empire, kingdom, or state?</P>
<P>The causes are many;—some of which follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. The love of importance is a general evil. It is natural to men, to dictate for others: they chuse to command the bushel and use the whip-row; to have the halter around the necks of others, to hang them at pleasure.</P>
<P N="2">2. An over-fondness for a particular system or sect. This gave rise to the first human establishment of religion, by Constantine the Great. Being con∣verted to the christian system, he established it in the Roman empire, compelled the pagans to submit, and banished the christian hereticks; built fine chapels at public expence, and forced large stipends for the preachers. All this was done out of love to the christian religion; but his love operated inadvertent∣ly; for he did the christian church more harm than all the persecuting emperors ever did. It is said, that in his day, a voice was heard from heaven, saying,
<PB N="13" REF="023495_0012_0FBFA270D0243F78"/>
"Now is poison spued into the churches." If this voice was not heard, it nevertheless was a truth; for from that day to this, the christian religion has been made a stirrup to mount the steed of popularity, wealth and ambition.</P>
<P N="3">3. To produce uniformity in religion. Rulers often fear that if they leave every man to think, speak and worship as he pleases, that the whole cause will be wrecked in diversity: to prevent which, they e∣stablish some standard of orthodoxy, to effect unifor∣mity. But, is uniformity attainable? Millions of men, women and children have been tortured to death, to produce uniformity, and yet the world has not advanced one inch towards it. And as long as men live in different parts of the world, have differ∣ent habits, education and interests, they will be dif∣ferent in judgement, humanly speaking.</P>
<P>Is uniformity of sentiments, in matters of religion, essential to the happiness of civil government?— Not at all. Government has no more to do with the religious opinions of men, than it has with the prin∣ciples of the mathematicks. Let every man speak freely without fear—maintain the principles that he believes—worship according to his own faith, either one God, three Gods, no God, or twenty Gods; and let government protect him in so doing, i. e. see that he meets with no personal abuse or loss of property, for his religious opinions. Instead of discouraging of him with proscriptions, fines, confiscation or death, let him be encouraged, as a free man, to bring forth his arguments and maintain his points with all boldness: then, if his doctrine is false, it will be
<PB N="14" REF="023495_0013_0FBFA271DC72D640"/>
confuted, and if it is true (tho' ever so novel) let others credit it.</P>
<P>When every man has this liberty, what can he wish for more?—A liberal man asks for nothing more of government.</P>
<P>The duty of magistrates is, not to judge of the divinity or tendency of doctrines; but when those principles break out into overt acts of violence, then to use the civil sword and punish the vagrant for what he has done, and not for the religious phrenzy that he acted from.</P>
<P>It is not supposeable, that any established creed contains the whole truth, and nothing but truth;— but supposing it did—which established church in the world has got it? All bigots contend for it:— each society cries out, "The temple of the Lord are we." Let one society be supposed to be in pos∣session of the whole—let that society be established by law—the creed of faith that they adopt be con∣secrated so sacred by government, that the man that disbelieves it must die—let this creed finally prevail over the whole world. I ask, what honor <HI>truth</HI> gets by all this? None at all. It is famed of a Prussian, called John the Cicero, that by one oration he recon∣ciled two contending princes, actually in war: but, says the historian, "It was his six thousand horse of battle that had the most persuasive oratory." So when one creed or church prevails over another, be∣ing armed with (a coat of mail) law and sword, truth gets no honor by the victory. Whereas if all stand upon one footing, being equally protected by law, as citizens, (not as saints) and one prevails over another
<PB N="15" REF="023495_0014_0FBFA27347DD1790"/>
by cool investigation and fair argument, then truth gains honor; and men more firmly believe it, than if it was made an essential article of salvation, by law.</P>
<P>Truth disdains the aid of law for its defence—it will stand upon its own merit. The heathens wor∣shiped a goddess, called truth, stark naked; and all human decorations of truth, serve only to destroy her virgin beauty. It is error, and error alone, that needs human support; and whenever men fly to the law or sword to protect their system of religion, and force it upon others, it is evident that they have some∣thing in their system that will not bear the light, and stand upon the basis of truth.</P>
<P N="4">4. The common objection, "that the ignorant part of the community are not capacitated to judge for themselves," supports the popish hierarchy, and all protestant as well as turkish and pagan establish∣ments, in idea.</P>
<P>But is this idea just? Has God chosen many of the wise and learned? Has he not hid the mystery of gospel truth from them, and revealed it unto babes? Does the world, by wisdom, know God? Did many of the rulers believe in Christ when he was upon earth? Were not the learned clergy (the scribes) his most inveterate enemies? Do not great men differ as much as little men in judgement? Have not almost all lawless errors crept into the world through the means of wise men (so called)? Is not a simple man, who makes nature and reason his study, a competent judge of things? Is the bible written (like Caligula's laws) so intricate and high that none but the letter learned (according to com∣mon
<PB N="16" REF="023495_0015_0FBFA278144EBB00"/>
phrase) can read it? Is not the vision written so plain that he that runs may read it? Do not those who understand the original languages, that the bible was written in, differ as much in judgement as others? Are the identical copies of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, together with the epistles, in every university, and in the hands of every master of arts? If not, have not the learned to trust to a human transcription, as much as the unlearned have to a translation? If these questions, and others of the like nature, can be confuted—then I will confess that it is wisdom for a conclave of bishops, or a convocation of clergy to frame a system out of the bible, and persuade the legislature to legalize it.— No.—It would be attended with so much expence, pride, domination, cruelty and bloodshed, that let me rather fall into infidelity: for no religion at all, is better than that which is worse than none.</P>
<P N="5">5. The ground work of these establishments of religion is, <HI>clerical influence.</HI> Rulers, being persuad∣ed by the clergy that an establishment of religion by human laws, would promote the knowledge of the gospel, quell religious disputes, prevent heresy, pro∣duce uniformity, and finally be advantageous to the state, establish such creeds as are framed by the cler∣gy:—and this they often do the more readily, when they are flattered by the clergy; that if they thus defend the truth, they will become <HI>nursing fathers</HI> to the church, and merit something considerable for themselves.</P>
<P>What stimulates the clergy to recommend this mode of reasoning is,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="17" REF="023495_0016_0FBFA27B0FB8FE70"/>1. Ignorance—not being able to confute error by fair argument.</P>
<P N="2">2. Indolence—not being willing to spend any time to confute the heretical.</P>
<P N="3">3. But chiefly covetousness, to get money—for it may be observed that in all these establishments, set∣tled salaries for the clergy, recoverable by law, are sure to be interwoven: and was not this the case, I am well convinced that there would not be many, if any religious establishments, in the christian world.</P>
<P>Having made the foregoing remarks, I shall next make some observations on the religion of <HI>Connecticut.</HI></P>
<P>If the citizens of this state, have any thing in exist∣ence that looks like a religious establishment, they ought to be very cautious; for being but a small part of the world, they can never expect to extend their religion over the whole of it, without it is so well founded that it cannot be confuted.</P>
<P>If one third part of the face of the globe is allowed to be seas, the earthy parts would compose 4550 such states as Connecticut. The American empire would afford above 200 of them. And as there is no religion in this empire, of the same stamp of the Connecticut <HI>standing order,</HI> upon the Say-Brook plat∣form, they may expect 199 against 1, at home, and 4549 against 1 abroad.</P>
<P>Connecticut and New-Haven were separate go∣vernments till the reign of Charles II. when they were incorporated together by a charter; which char∣ter is still considered, by some, as the basis of go∣vernment.</P>
<P>At present, there are in the state about 168 presby∣terial
<PB N="18" REF="023495_0017_0FBFA27C40CED538"/>
congregational and consociated preachers; 35 baptists; 20 episcopalians; 10 separate-congregation∣als, and a few of other denominations. The first are the <HI>standing order</HI> of Connecticut; to whom all others have to pay obeisance. Societies of the <HI>stand∣ing order</HI> are formed by law: none have right to vote therein but men, of age, who possess property to the amount of 40<HI>l.</HI> and are in full communion in the church. Their choice of ministers is by ma∣jor vote; and what the society agree to give him annually, is levied upon all within the limits of the society-bounds; except they bring a certificate to the clerk of the society, that they attend worship elsewhere, and contribute to the satisfaction of the society where they attend. The money being levied on the people, is destrainable by law; and perpetu∣ally binding on the society till the minister is dismiss∣ed by a council, or by death, from his charge.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to give a detail of all the tumults, oppression, fines and imprisonments, that have heretofore been occasioned by this <HI>law-religion.</HI> These things are partly dead and buried, and if they do not rise of themselves, let them sleep peaceably in the dust forever. Let it suffice on this head, to say, that it is not possible, in the nature of things, to establish religion by human laws, without perverting the design of civil law and oppressing the people.</P>
<P>The certificate that a dissenter produces to the society clerk, must be signed by some officer of the dissenting church, and such church must be protest∣ant-christian; for heathens, deists, jews and papists are not indulged in the certificate law: all of them▪
<PB N="19" REF="023495_0018_0FBFA27E282BB8D0"/>
as well as turks, must therefore be taxed to the standing order, although they never go among them, or know where the meeting-house is.</P>
<P>This certificate law is founded on this principle, "That it is the duty of all persons to support the gospel and the worship of God." Is this principle founded in justice? Is it the duty of a deist to sup∣port that which he believes to be a cheat and impo∣sition? Is it the duty of a jew to support the reli∣gion of Jesus Christ, when he really believes that he was an impostor? Must the papists be forced to pay men for preaching down the supremacy of the pope, whom they are sure is the head of the church? Must a turk maintain a religion, opposed to the <HI>alkoran,</HI> which he holds as the sacred oracles of hea∣ven? These things want better confirmation. If we suppose that it is the duty of all these to support the protestant christian religion, as being the best religion in the world; yet how comes it to pass that human legislatures have right to force them so to do? I now call for an instance where Jesus Christ, the author of his religion, or the apostles, who were divinely inspired, ever gave orders to, or intimated that the civil powers on earth ought to force people to observe the rules and doctrine of the gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomed</HI> called in the use of law and sword to convert people to his religion; but Jesus did not— does not.</P>
<P>It is the duty of men to love God with all their hearts, and their neighbours as themselves; but have legislatures authority to punish men if they do not? —So there are many things that Jesus and the apo∣stles
<PB N="20" REF="023495_0019_0FBFA280F3D2F3D8"/>
taught, that men ought to obey, which yet the civil law has no concerns in.</P>
<P>That it is the duty of men, who are taught in the word, to communicate to him that teaches, is be∣yond controversy; but that it is the province of the civil law to force them to do so, is denied.</P>
<P>The charter of Charles the second, is supposed to be the basis of government in Connecticut; and I request any gentleman to point out a single clause in that charter, which authorizes the legislature to make any religious laws, establish any religion, or force people to build meeting-houses or pay preach∣ers. If there is no such constitutional clause, it follows, that the laws are usurpasive in the legisla∣tors and not binding on the people. I shall here add, that if the legislature of Connecticut have au∣thority to establish the religion which they prefer to all religions, and force men to support it; then every legislature or legislator has the same authority; and if this be true, the separation of the christians from the pagans, the departure of the protestants from the papists, and the dissention of the presby∣terians from the church of England were all schisms of a criminal nature; and all the persecution that they have met with, is the just effect of their stub∣bornness.</P>
<P>The certificate law supposes, 1. That the legisla∣ture have power to establish a religion. This is false. 2. That they have authority to grant indul∣gence to non-conformists:—this is also false; for religious liberty is a <HI>right</HI> and not a <HI>favor.</HI> 3. That

the legitimate power of government extends to force people to part with their money for religious pur∣poses. This cannot be proved from the new testa∣ment.</P>
<P>The certificate law has lately passed a new mod∣ification. Justices of the peace must now examine them;—this gives ministers of state a power over religious concerns that the new-testament does not. —To examine the law, part by part, would be needless—for the whole of it is wrong.</P>
<P>From what is said, this question arises, "Are not contracts with ministers, i. e. between ministers and people, as obligatory as any contracts whatever?" —The simple answer is, Yes. Ministers should share the same protection of the law, that other men do, and no more. To proscribe them from seats of legislation, &amp;c. is cruel. To indulge them with an exemption from taxes and bearing arms, is a tempt∣ing emolument. The law should be silent about them; protect them as citizens, (not as sacred offi∣cers) for the civil law knows no sacred, religious officers.</P>
<P>In Rhode-Island, if a congregation of people a∣gree to give a preacher a certain sum of money for preaching, the bond is not recoverable by law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some men, who are best informed in the laws of Rhode-Island, say, that if ever there was such an a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in that state, there is nothing like it in existence at this day; and perhaps it is only cast upon them as a stigma, because they have ever been friends to religious liberty. However, as the principle is supportable, I have treated it as a real fact: and this I have done th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore willingly, because nine-tenths of the people believe it is a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="023495_0021_0FBFA28A9DAC92A8"/>This law was formed upon a good principle, but, unhappy for the makers of that law, they were in∣coherent in the superstructure.</P>
<P>The principle of the law, is, that the gospel is not to be supported by law; that civil rulers have no∣thing to do with religion, in their civil capacities; What business had they then to make that law?— The evil seemed to arise from a blending religious <HI>right</HI> and religious <HI>opinions</HI> together. Religious <HI>right</HI> should be protected to <HI>all</HI> men, religious <HI>opinion</HI> to none; i. e. government should confirm the first unto all; the last unto none: each individual having a <HI>right</HI> to differ from all others in <HI>opinion</HI> if he is so persuaded. If a number of people in Rhode-Island or elsewhere are of opinion, that ministers of the gospel ought to be supported by law, and chuse to be bound by a bond to pay him; government has no just authority to declare that bond illegal; for in so doing, they interfere with private contracts, and deny the people the liberty of conscience. If these people bind nobody but themselves—who is injured by their religious opinions? But if they bind an individual besides themselves, the bond is fraudulent, and ought to be declared illegal. And here lies the mischief of Connecticut religion. My lord, major vote, binds all the minor part, unless they submit to idolatry; i. e. pay an acknowledgement to a power that Jesus Christ never ordained in his church; I mean produce a certificate. Yea further, jews, turks, heathens, papists and deists, if such there are in Connecticut, are bound, and have no redress: and further, this bond is not annually given, but for
<PB N="23" REF="023495_0022_0FBFA2901B22BF30"/>
life, except the minister is dismissed by a number of others, who are in the same predicament with himself.</P>
<P>Although it is no abridgement of religious lib∣erty for congregations to pay their preachers by legal force, in the manner prescribed above, yet it is antichristian; such a church cannot be a church of Christ, because they are not governed by Christ's laws, but by the laws of state; and such ministers do not appear like ambassadors of Christ, but like ministers of state.</P>
<P>The next question is this, "Suppose a congre∣gation of people have agreed to give a minister a certain sum of money annually, for life or during good behaviour; and in a course of time, some or all of them change their opinions, and verily be∣lieve that the preacher is in a capital error; and really from conscience, dissent from him—are they still bound to comply with their engagements to the preacher?"—This question is supposeable, and I believe there have been a few instances of the kind.</P>
<P>If men have bound themselves—honor and hon∣esty call upon them to comply—but God and con∣science call upon them to come out from among them, and let such blind guides alone.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The phrase of <HI>blind guides,</HI> is not intended to cast contempt upon any order of religious preachers; for, let a preacher be or∣thodox or hetrodox, virtuous or vicious, he is always a <HI>blind guide</HI> to those who differ from him in opinion.</NOTE> Honor and honesty are amiable virtues; but God and con∣science
<PB N="24" REF="023495_0023_0FBFA292B60986D0"/>
call to perfidiousness. This shows the im∣propriety of such contracts—which always may, and sometimes do lead into such labyrinths. Time enough to pay a man after his labour is over.— People are not required to communicate to the <HI>teacher</HI> before they are <HI>taught.</HI> A man, called of God to preach, feels a necessity to preach, and a woe if he does not. And if he is sent by Christ he looks to him and his laws for support; and if men com∣ply with their duty, he finds relief; if not, he must go to his field, as the priests of old did. A man cannot give a more glaring proof of his covetousness and irreligion, than to say, "If you will give me so much, then I will preach, but if not, be assured I will not preach to you."</P>
<P>So that in answering the question, instead of de∣termining which of the evils to chuse; either to disobey God and conscience, or break honour and honesty, I would recommend an escape of both evils, by entering into no such contracts: for the natural evils of imprudence, that men are fallen into, neither God nor man can prevent.</P>
<P>A minister must have a hard heart, to wish men to be forced to pay him, when (thro' conscience, en∣thusiasm, or a private pique) they dissent from his ministry. The spirit of the gospel disdains such measures.</P>
<P>The question before us, is not applicable to many cases in Connecticut: the dissenting churches make no contracts for a longer term than a year, and most of them make none at all. Societies, of the <HI>stand∣ing order,</HI> rarely bind themselves, in contract with
<PB N="25" REF="023495_0024_0FBFA2943439C040"/>
preachers, without binding others beside themselves: and when that is the case the bond is fraudulent: and if those who are bound involuntarily can get clear, it is no breach of honor or honesty.</P>
<P>A few additional remarks shall close my piece.</P>
<P N="1">I. The church of Rome, was at first constituted according to the gospel; and at that time her faith was spoken of through the whole world. Being espoused to Christ, as a chaste virgin, she kept her bed pure for her husband, almost three hundred years: but afterwards she played the whore with the kings and princes of this world; who with their gold and wealth came in unto her, and she became a strum∣pet:—and as she was the first christian church that ever forsook the laws of Christ for her conduct; and received the laws of his rivals; i. e. was esta∣blished by human law, and governed by the legali∣zed edicts of councils; and received large sums of money to support her preachers and her worship, by the force of civil power—she is called the MO∣THER OF HARLOTS: and all protestant church∣es, who are regulated by law, and force people to support their preachers, build meeting-houses and otherwise maintain their worship, are DAUGHTERS of this HOLY MOTHER.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am not a citizen of Connecticut—the reli∣gious laws of the state do not oppress me, and I expect never will personally; but a love to religious liberty in general induces me thus to speak. Was
<PB N="26" REF="023495_0025_0FBFA295AD383F88"/>
I a resident in the state, I could not give or receive a certificate to be exempted from ministerial taxes; for in so doing I should confess that the legislature had authority, to pamper one religious order in the state, and make all others pay obeisance to that <HI>sheef.</HI> —It is high time to know whether all are to be free alike; and whether ministers of state are to be lords over God's heritage.</P>
<P>And here I shall ask the citizens of Connecticut, Whether, in the months of April and September, when they chuse their deputies for the assembly, they mean to surrender to them the rights of conscience, and authorize them to make laws, binding on their consciences? If not, then all such acts are con∣trary to the intention of constituent power, as well as unconstitutional and antichristian.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is likely that one part of the people in Connecticut believe, in conscience, that gospel preach∣ers should be supported by the force of law; and the other part believe that it is not in the province of civil law to interfere or any ways meddle with religious matters. How are both parties to be pro∣tected by law, in their consciencious belief?</P>
<P>Very easily.—Let all those whose consciences dic∣tate that they ought to be taxed by law to maintain their preacher, bring in their names to the society-clerk, by a certain day, and then assess them all, according to their estates, to raise the sum, stipulated in the contract; and all others go free. Both par∣ties, by this method would enjoy the full liberty of conscience, without oppressing one another—the law
<PB N="27" REF="023495_0026_0FBFA2A001CB7900"/>
use no force in matters of conscience—the evil of Rhode-Island law be escaped—and no persons could find fault with it (in a political point of view), but those who fear the consciences of too many would lie dormant, and therefore wish to force them to pay. Here let it be noted; that there are many in the world, who believe, in conscience, that a minister is not entitled to any acknowledgement for his services, without he is so poor that he cannot live without it, (and thereby convert a gospel debt to alms):— Though this opinion is not founded either on reason or scripture; yet it is a better opinion than that which would force them to pay a preacher by hu∣man law.</P>
<P N="4">IV. How mortifying must it be to foreigners, and how far from conciliatory is it, to citizens of the American states, who, when they come into Connecticut to reside must either conform to the religion of Connecticut, or produce a certificate? Does this look like religious liberty or human friend∣ship? Suppose that man (whose name need not be mentioned) that fills every American heart with pleasure and awe, should remove to Connecticut for his health, or any other cause—what a scandal would it be to the state, to tax him to a presbyterian min∣ister, unless he produced a certificate, informing them that he was an episcopalian?</P>
<P N="5">V. The federal constitution certainly had the advantage, of any of the state constitutions, in being made by the wisest men in the whole nation, and
<PB N="28" REF="023495_0027_0FBFA2A28515E910"/>
after an experiment of a number of years trial, upon republican principles: and that constitution forbids congress ever to establish any kind of religion, or require any religious test to qualify any officer in any department of federal government. Let a man be Pagan, Turk, Jew or Christian, he is eligible to any post in that government. So that if the prin∣ciples of religious liberty, contended for in the fore∣going pages, are supposed to be fraught with deism, fourteen states, in union, are now fraught with the same. But the separate states have not surrendered that (supposed) right of establishing religion, to Congress. Each state retains all its power, saving what is given to the general government, by the federal constitution. The assembly of Connecticut, therefore, still undertake to guide the helm of re∣ligion: and if Congress were disposed▪ yet they could not prevent it, by any power vested in them by the states. Therefore, if any of the people of Connecticut feel oppressed by the certificate law, or any other of the like nature, their proper mode of procedure will be to remonstrate against the op∣pression, and petition the assembly for a redress of grievance.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Divines generally inform us, that there is such a time to come (called the <HI>Latter-Day Glory),</HI> when the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters do the sea: and that this day will appear upon the destruction of antichrist: If so, I am well convinced that Jesus will first remove all the hindrances of religious establishments, and
<PB N="29" REF="023495_0028_0FBFA2A40213B148"/>
cause all men to be free in matters of religion.— When this is effected, he will say to the kings and great men of the earth, <Q>Now see what I can do: ye have been afraid to leave the church and gos∣pel in my hands alone, without steadying the ark by human law; but now I have taken the power and kingdom to myself; and will work for my own glory.</Q>—Here let me add, that in the southern states, where there has been the greatest freedom from religious oppression; where liberty of conscience is entirely enjoyed; there has been the greatest revival of religion; which is an∣other proof that true religion can, and will prevail best, where it is left entirely to Christ.</P>
