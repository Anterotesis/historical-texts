<Q><HI>Wherefore, I will not be negligent to put you al∣ways in remembrance of these Things; though ye know them, and be established in the present Truth; yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in remembrance; know∣ing that shortly, I must put off this Taber∣nacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.

<P>THE chief Design of our Existence, is high and noble; worthy of a God
<PB N="4" REF="010950_0004_0F85307F8FDEB6B0"/>
to have, in making his Creature Man, and of our utmost attention and solicitude to reach unto it. As God, in his Works, could not have an higher End, than his own Glory, and his Creature's good; we are not in all our Life and Service, to stop at a lower; but, ever keep it in view, to rise up unto it, in the exercises of Re∣ligion, that excellent and important Busi∣ness assigned us; which, it seems, even the apostacy of Man, and malice of Satan; is not an irremoveable Bar in the Way of: When; sovereign Grace in Christ, has open'd the Way of our recovery unto it, and the happiness connected with it. Re∣ligion then, thus revives in the World, and Heaven again opens to View; accord∣ing to the Gospel of God our Saviour, which brings life and immortality to light. I say, this Business, is yet to occupy the chief Room in the whole course of our life here, that it may gloriously fill an Eternity hereafter. But for which, how could it have been worth while for Man to exist, that rational, conscious Creature, that he is; capable of a connexion and communion with God.</P>
<P>BUT, how short a Time has Man, as a probationer for a better State of existence?
<PB N="5" REF="010950_0005_0F8530810DBBDE80"/>
which, the Apostle in our Text, appears to have a clear and affecting View of; as he counted shortly to put off the Tabernacle of the flesh; and have done preaching the Gospel of Christ, that delightful Business of the better part of his Life. Man's Life is <HI>soon cut off;</HI> and <HI>he flys away</HI> to yonder World of Spi∣rits—So that, the whole run of Business here, of this and that kind; is short, and soon over, with Time; which, hastens to an end. But, short as Time is, (always on the wing,) it is long enough to reach unto, and introduce Eternity; which, cer∣tainly follows upon the shortest Life that is. We therefore, had need be early adorn'd with God's Image, and the Savi∣our's Righteousness; and by the Grace of God, fill up our Time well; to be ready for the important Change of States and Worlds for ever. The very Thing, the Apostle pressed in the course of his Mini∣stry, and experienc'd in the Case of his own Soul. And, while we are spared in Life; may it be, as <HI>God spareth a Son to serve him.</HI> For, it is a forfeited Life, that is spared▪ which carries in it, the greater obligation on us, to spend it well, as the fruit of having dedicated it, and our selves unto God.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010950_0006_0F853081CF6EC288"/>
VERY justly may each one of us say; <HI>having obtained help of God, I continue unto this Day.</HI> Yea, in the midst of dis∣eases, dangers and deaths; and that, which is more; notwithstanding all our Offences. For, if in any single Moment, God had withdrawn his Care, in that Moment, we had retired from Life.</P>
<P>BUT, more especially, may I adopt the Words, <HI>having obtained help,</HI> &amp;c. with an animated Gratitude, to the great <HI>Preser∣ver of Men: who in the riches of his for∣bearance,</HI> hath continued me, (through many Years infirmity in former Life, and many scenes of heavy Trial in the greater part of Life) into the <HI>Seventy-fourth</HI> Year of my Age; with confirmed Health, in some late Years. A rare Instance of signal Mercy. <HI>A Wonder to many,</HI> most justly so to <HI>my self:</HI> more especially, as through Grace, I have been carried along to the completion of half a Century, in the Mi∣nistry—<HI>Selah</HI>—Pause a little here, Oh my Soul; and acknowledge him in all this, who is <HI>glorious in Holiness, fearful in Praises, doing Wonders.</HI></P>
<P>AND now justly looking forward to the close of my Life and Ministry; which is gathering in apace upon me: And, with
<PB N="7" REF="010950_0007_0F85308667155B18"/>
this argument before me; to animate me, by the grace of God, to fill up the resi∣due of my Days, with the important Busi∣ness of Religion and of my Station; I have thought it my Duty, to take this public Notice of God's great Goodness, in con∣tinuing me in some Measure capable of public Business, to so remarkable a Period. A kind of <HI>Jubilee</HI> for rejoicing in the di∣vine Goodness; and for Liberty yet to serve the most High in his Church. Verily, this Day, is <Q>Witness for God that he is good, and doeth good.</Q> This Day, the last Sabbath of the <HI>Fiftieth</HI> Year in Office; may be noted indeed, as an <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> indicating that <HI>hitherto the Lord hath helped me:</HI> And may serve both as a Memorial, and Monitor unto me. I say, a <HI>Remembrancer</HI> of God's Mercy to me, and a <HI>Monitor</HI> of my Obligation to him; to be indeed, more than ever devo∣ted to his Service. With which view, I have chosen the Words read, to improve to the Glory of God, and to my own Advantage and your's.</P>
<P>THIS Apostle, who in his second Epistle, inserts these important, affecting Passages, which I have read; had been faithful in <HI>preaching</HI> the very gospel, so worthy of
<PB N="8" REF="010950_0008_0F8530871A7EB700"/>
their Attention and Remembrance; to whom he <HI>wrote.</HI> And then, he didn't think he had done enough, without <HI>re∣minding</HI> them of these Things; and doing all that was proper to <HI>fix</HI> them in their Minds for lasting Profit: And therefore, says, <Q>I will not be negligent always to put you in Remembrance of these Things:</Q> The very Doctrines, and great Things of the Gospel, which he had delivered to them. And they (some of them) had a good knowledge of, and at present appeared well established in them; yet, this, he thinks to be the Work of his remaining Days, to be bringing them to their Remembrance; and one great Ar∣gument, he had to excite him unto it; was his View of the small remains of Life now before him, and swift approach of Death, which, by revelation had been shewed him. And therefore, adds, a pathetic <Q><HI>Moreover,</HI> I will endeavour that you may be able after my decease, to have these Things always in Remembrance,</Q> i. e. as long as they should live after him; they might, by his faithfulness to them now, be profit∣ed by them; yea, carry the good favour thereof, to their own Grave, and find the unspeakable Benefit of it, beyond all Time.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010950_0009_0F8530880BC5CF28"/>
Whence, I collect these OBSERVATIONS.</P>
<P>I. 'TIS the Character of a good Minister of Jesus Christ, and faithful in his Ser∣vice; to be in the course of his Ministry, preaching the <HI>great Doctrines and Duties</HI> of the Gospel: insisting chiefly <HI>on them</HI> for the saving good of Men's Souls.</P>
<P>II. WHEN he hath done this, in his for∣mer Ministry; yet, he is not to neglect proper Means to refresh their Memories herewith, to impress them deep on their Hearts.</P>
<P>III. HE is accordingly to fill up the resi∣due of his Days, very much to this Purpose. And,</P>
<P>IV. FROM this Consideration, that he cannot live long to do this Service. And,</P>
<P>V. FOR this End, are Ministers to exert themselves; that their Hearers may reap the Advantage of it after their decease.</P>
<P>I. I observe, 'tis the Character of a good Minister of Jesus Christ, and faithful in his Service; to be in the Course of his Ministry, preaching the great <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Duties of the Gospel,</HI> insisting chiefly on them for the saving good of Men's Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010950_0010_0F85308898591BC8"/>
THE Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> as also <HI>Paul</HI> and others did so. When, God had <Q>put them into the Ministry, as counting them faithful,</Q> they spent their Life in it. And so have others, down to this Day; who were of the right Stamp: <Q>giving themselves, (as charg'd) to reading and meditation, on those Things,</Q> which be∣long to the important Business of their Office; <Q>studying to shew themselves approved of God,</Q> and unto Men's Consciences; <Q>as Workmen that need not to be asha∣med, rightly dividing the Word of Truth;</Q> which is yet, and always will be the Character of true and faithful Mi∣nisters of the Gospel. Our Apostle here, in what is said of him, in his Epistles, is a good Pattern indeed, for imitation, through all Ages.</P>
<P>IN his first Epistle he discourseth of the great <HI>Doctrines of Grace</HI>—of <HI>Predestination</HI> unto Life, <Q>according to the fore-know∣lege of God the Father, through sanctifi∣cation of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the Blood of Christ.</Q> ver. 2.—of <HI>Regeneration</HI> by the Spirit of God, as the sole Author; while the Word is the well chosen and appointed Means thereof: as here declared to be <Q>according to his
<PB N="11" REF="010950_0011_0F8530895973A7D0"/>
abundant Mercy, that he hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Re∣surrection of Christ from the dead.</Q> v. 3. to the same Purpose with that most express passage in Jam. 1. 18. <Q>Of his own Will begat he us, with the Word of Truth.</Q>—And of <HI>Perseverance</HI> unto Life; as is declared in v. 4, 5. that the Regenerate <Q>who are born to an heavenly Inheritance, are kept by the mighty Power of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</Q>—And this we find also; in his preaching the im∣portant Doctrines of the Gospel; that he omits not, but insists upon the <HI>sacrifice of Christ, upon the Cross,</HI> the all-availing Me∣rit of his whole obedience; for our <HI>Justi∣fication</HI> unto Life, see ver. 11, 19.</P>
<P>As also the great <HI>Duties of the Gospel,</HI> are what he much inculcates. As, that Chris∣tians <Q>do gird up the Loins of their Minds, be sober and hope to the End, for the Grace, that is to be brought to them, at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obe∣dient Children, not fashioning themselves according to the former Lusts, in their Ignorance; but, as he which hath cal∣led them is holy; so that they be holy in all Manner of Conversation and God∣liness; passing the Time of their Sojour∣ning
<PB N="12" REF="010950_0012_0F85308A1DA320B0"/>
here in fear.</Q> ver. 13,—17. And if we look through his whole first Epistle into this; where, he speaks particularly of <Q><HI>The Righteousness of God, and our Soviour Je∣sus Christ;</HI> which becomes our's by a precious Faith.</Q> And where he parti∣cularly presseth <HI>Diligence,</HI> in <Q>adding to Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Know∣lege;</Q> and so on to the completion of the Christian Character. And so, to <Q>make our Calling and Election sure.</Q>—I say, if we view, what he has wrote clear thrô we shall find, what important <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Duties,</HI> he insisted on; wherein, all faithful Ministers, will in some good Mea∣sure follow him: Yes; all such, will preach up free Grace—Christ Crucified—and Faith in him, &amp;c.—Hence,</P>
<P>II. I OBSERVE, that when the faithful Minister of Jesus Christ, hath done this, in his former Ministry; still, he doth by no Means, neglect proper Steps, to remind his People of these Things; for their deeper Impression on their Hearts. It was so, with the Apostle, when he had preached the great Doctrines, and urged the great Du∣ties of the Gospel; and shown the vast Importance of them, with respect to pre∣sent Comfort, and future Happiness; He
<PB N="13" REF="010950_0013_0F85308AD10F1890"/>
don't think, he had done enough; but says, as in the Text; <Q>Wherefore, I will not be negligent to put, you always in re∣membrance of these Things.</Q>—<HI>Where∣fore;</HI> that is, because of the great Impor∣tance and Necessity of these Things, which I have taught in the Course of my Ministry heretofore; "I will not be Negligent,"—No; nothing shall make me so; nothing shall divert me from my duty, not any worldly Views and Motives; nor shall any Thing which mine Enemies throw in my Way, as an embarrasment to my Work; discourage me: Nor yet, that which looks the most Plausible by way of Excuse, to relax my Care in this Matter: (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR>) that "you do know these Things" already; and appear to be <Q>established, in the pre∣sent Truth,</Q> the labouring Truths of the Day; yet, I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these Things: But will be frequently refreshing your Me∣mories with them; and so endeavour by all Means, to keep these Things with you, to confirm you more and more in the faith of the Gospel, and practice of Christianity.</P>
<P>So, faithful Ministers to this Day, (as it is the Character of such,) will not only, by preaching sound Doctrine to their Hearers,
<PB N="14" REF="010950_0014_0F85308B93374408"/>
endeavour to instruct them well in the very Things of God, that they may know them well, and be established therein, <Q>in the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</Q> &amp;c.—But, and though many of them, may al∣ready know them well, and profess to be well established in them; they will yet insist upon them over, and over; with fresh Il∣lustrations and Arguments, and every Way, they can properly take; be putting them in Remembrance hereof.</P>
<P>III. I OBSERVE, that the faithful Mi∣nister, who hath served long already, is to fill up the residue of his Days much to this purpose: Reminding his People of the im∣portant Things, they have been taught. "I think it meet" (says the Apostle) fit and highly proper, <Q>as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to stir you up, by put∣ting you in Remembrance.</Q> As if he had said, Upon the most serious review of the Duty of my Office, of the importance of those Things, I have taught you, and of your receiving them to saving Profit; it is my settled Thought and Resolution; that as long as I live, I will exert my self to ex∣cite you, unto a fresh assent to the Truth, by a most impressive Review of the excel∣lence and worth thereof, that you might
<PB N="15" REF="010950_0015_0F85308C5200F688"/>
better than ever yield Obedience unto it; that <Q>you might not lose, (or seem to lose) what you have gained,</Q> nor, any way fail of a right Christian stedfastness in Faith and Duty. What the Apostle was after, by all his Pains in this Matter, was, that they be thorough, persevering Christians, and be excited abundantly to <Q>exercise themselves unto Godliness.</Q></P>
<P>AND thus, will faithful Ministers of Christ, in all Ages of the Church, do; not be content with preaching up moral Ver∣tue, Self-Government, Righteousness, and Charity; but insist much on the Subjects of christian Revelation, as <HI>Paul,</HI> who would especially preach <Q>Christ and him Cruci∣fied.</Q> They will enter into the Marrow of the Gospel, and dwell much upon the Words of Christ, that "are Spirit and Life." They will esteem it fitting and necessary, that as long as they live, and can do it, to preach often upon Subjects of the greatest Moment, and thereby be exciting their People to "obey the Truth:" (and more and more so,) in which consists the Life of Religion. Oh; this "doing the Truth" as St. John expresses it, is what Crowns all, <Q>If ye know these Things happy are ye if ye do them.</Q> Those who have
<PB N="16" REF="010950_0016_0F85308D14D13D28"/>
some good Understanding of the Principles of Religion, and appear well set in the Practice thereof; do yet need <Q>Line upon Line, to stir them up, even their pure Minds by Way of Remembrance,</Q> in Order to better Practice.</P>
<P>IV. I OBSERVE that Ministers are to be faithful in all their Duty, from the Con∣sideration of the scanty Measure of their Opportunities for it; that they are not to live long, especially, when the most of their Day is gone already. And so, will have but a little Time for this Service. Hence says the Apostle, <Q>I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up—knowing that <HI>shortly</HI> I must put off this Tabernacle, as the Lord Jesus hath shewed me.</Q> Some have had strange premonitions of their Death, the near approach of it: But, there was something more special in the Case of <HI>Peter;</HI> the Lord Jesus had shewed him above 30 Years before, the <HI>Manner,</HI> if not the <HI>Time</HI> of his Death—See Joh. 21. 18, 19.—<Q>When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy Hand, &amp;c. This spake he, signifying by what Death he should glorify God.</Q> That is, by dying on the Cross, in which, he was to follow Christ, die as he did; he
<PB N="17" REF="010950_0017_0F85308DD46F6A30"/>
was, in the Day, when Christ spake these Words to him, very confident, that he could follow Christ any where, even to Death. This was Self-confidence, and failed him; that, instead of <HI>dying</HI> with Christ, he <HI>deny'd</HI> him over and over, before Christ came to die himself: But <HI>Peter</HI> re∣pents of this; and after his Recovery, has a better kind of Confidence and Courage: so that, when called to suffer <HI>Martyrdom</HI> for Christ, as the Lord told him he should, <HI>he stretched forth his Hands,</HI> freely yielded to be Crucified, which was at <HI>Rome,</HI> under the cruel Persecution of <HI>Nero,</HI> but a little after he wrote these Epistles; Anno Dom. 65. or 66. For then he was grown old, when the Lord Jesus said he should be Crucified. So that he might well say now, "I must shortly put off this Tabernacle." 'Tis observ'd by Historians, the exact Time is not ascertain'd, but, by all Accounts, might not be far from 67. or 68. and some say, at the same Time, yea, the very Day, that <HI>Paul</HI> was beheaded there, by <HI>Nero,</HI> for converting one of his Concubines to the Christian Faith. Which Death, <HI>he</HI> might have some previous Warning of, or at least, of the near approach of Death, in some Form; when he says, <HI>The Time of my
<PB N="18" REF="010950_0018_0F85308F82DF9498"/>
departure is at Hand:</HI> And <HI>both</HI> of them, aware of this; did exert themselves the more, to do all the good they could, whilst they liv'd and had Opportunity for it.—</P>
<P>THUS faithful Ministers since; in the View of their uncertain, but short Stay at the longest, may well be excited to Dili∣gence in their Master's Work: especially, if they have liv'd long already: as their old Age then, (without a special Revelation from the Lord Jesus) speaks the near Ap∣proach of their Death, When a Minister is far advanced in Life, to Three-score Years and Ten, or more, he must needs know, that shortly, he shall put off this Tabernacle; and resign Office and Life; and all Opportunity here, of doing good. For of such an Age, it is justly and aptly said; <HI>It is soon cut off, and we fly away,</HI> Psal. 90. 10. It is something as the Sun, when past the Meridian, (and in short Days too) it suddenly shoots down, and Sets at once. So the Life of an old Man, far past the Meridian, hastens a-pace to the Close, and is suddenly up, and gone. But, no improving the small remains of Life, so well, as by filling it up with Duty to God, and Usefulness to Men; and the more chearfully, as our Days draw on a-pace to a Period.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010950_0019_0F8530900EA36BD8"/>
IT is the Character, and will be the Pra∣ctice, of faithful Ministers, to exert them∣selves, in Study and Diligence, in all the Exercises of their Office, that they can; <Q>to fulfil the Ministry which they have received of the Lord Jesus.</Q> And en∣deavour to the last, the best good of their Charge. A Minister of Christ, is to be eminently like <Q>the Sun that rejoiceth as a strong Man to run his Race,</Q> and <HI>Shines</HI> as he <HI>goes;</HI> even till he <HI>Sets.</HI> When a good Minister's Days, and Time, contracts a∣pace; and his Thoughts grow more Weighty; and full of Religion, and of the World he's going to; his Zeal encreases; and according to his Capacity, he will be truly <HI>fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>V. FOR this End, are Ministers to ex∣ert themselves, and the faithful will do so; that their Hearers may reap the Advantage of it, after their Decease. As the Apostle here adds, <Q>Moreover, I will endeavour, that you may be able, after my Decease, to have these Things always <HI>in Remem∣brance.</HI></Q> <HI>This Word,</HI> is much used by the Apostle, as if very Significative and Em∣phatical; like the <HI>Burthen</HI> of a Song; which has the carrying Sound with it, and the leading Sentiments express'd by it: which,
<PB N="20" REF="010950_0020_0F85309373B2CD60"/>
indeed is the Case here. Not enough (it seems) that People know, and are esta∣blish'd in the Truth: To be sure, not enough that they have a speculative View of it, and have a rational Belief of it; but, they must Remember it; have it always ready, as <HI>Food</HI> to feed upon constantly, and as a <HI>Rule</HI> always to live by. They must attend to it, not for present Amusement, or to be pleased just while they are hearing a good Sermon; but attend to it, as <HI>Lydia</HI> did to the Things spoken by <HI>Paul;</HI> attend to the very Important Things spoken of, with a View of having them imprest on their Minds, fix'd there, for lasting Good; which, you see the Apostle was greatly concerned about: and therefore, insists upon it here, as he doth. <Q>I <HI>will not</HI> be negligent,</Q> (a strong way of expressing his Care in this Matter) <Q>to put you al∣ways in Remembrance of these Things.</Q> Again, <Q>I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in Remembrance;</Q> ah, and exert my self in this; because, I know, that in a little Time I can do it no more; Therefore, while I live, <Q>I will endeavour that you be able, after my Decease, to have these Things always in your Remem∣brance.</Q>
<PB N="21" REF="010950_0021_0F8530946302B520"/>
Thus, he dwells upon the Sub∣ject, as a very main Thing with him, and what should be so with us; else we read and hear, as if we did it not; nor were like to be the better. The Apostle, (it seems) in the very decline of Life, just as he was finishing his Ministry, was laying in greatly for the future Advantage of Men's Souls; that, when he was dead and gone, they might be able to have those Things in Remembrance, which they had heard. And so always, as long as they liv'd after him, be reaping the good of his Sermons and Epistles.</P>
<P>THUS, faithful Ministers now, the near∣er they come to the finishing their Course; will be the more concern'd for the Salva∣tion of their dear Charge; that after their Decease, their Hearers, may be able to re∣collect what they have been taught; have it present with them, and fix'd in their Minds to their best and lasting Advantage; (that is) well grounded in Faith and Love, never to be <Q>moved away, from the hope of the Gospel.</Q> Therefore, they will Pray and Preach, Converse and Live, in a good Measure as Persons looking into E∣ternity. They will treat important Sub∣jects with great Plainness and Solemnity,
<PB N="22" REF="010950_0022_0F853095180421E0"/>
and as much perspicuity and openness to Men's Understandings, as they can: speak with Pathos and Concern to have these Things well receiv'd and fix'd in their Minds, and their Faith in them Establish'd,—This, good Ministers love to see much of, and of the probability of its existing after they are gone. Oh, how careful that their People do not forsake the right Ways of the Lord, that they be not Wavering, and driven to and fro, by every Wind of Doctrine, after their Decease; but by an exemplary Soundness in the Faith, be hap∣pily secure from Declension in any Thing of Religion; or true Comfort and the Peace of religious Society and Christian Communion. It was very Affecting to St. Paul, what he told his Hearers, and knew, <ABBR>viz,</ABBR> <Q>That after his Departure, grievous Wolves wou'd enter in among them not sparing the Flock, and that of their own selves, would Men arise, speaking per∣verse Things, to draw away Disciples after them.</Q> See Acts 20, 29, 30. But, yet he would do all he could, (to prevent this as much as might be,) in not shunning to declare the whole Counsel of God. As he says in v. 27.—And so <HI>Peter</HI> would do, all he could, that People
<PB N="23" REF="010950_0023_0F85309552E56ED0"/>
might have what he taught them, always in Remembrance: To continue sound in the Faith, and stedfast in the Order of the Gospel.—</P>
<P>AND thus faithful Ministers down to this Day, will Study hard, Pray earnestly, Preach clearly and powerfully; yea, Con∣verse and Argue, and do all they can, to instruct the People in the very Truth, as it is in Jesus; the very Faith and Instituti∣ons of the Gospel, and to establish them therein; by having all that done for them, which, by the blessing of God shall enable them to have the Things of God and Jesus Christ, always in Remembrance; as the Matter of their Faith, and Guide of their Practice, from Generation to Generation; that, a right Scriptural Religion, and Gos∣pel Order, may live on, to all succeeding Time. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. THE APPLICATION, with something HISTORICAL.</HEAD>
<P>1. USE, FROM hence it appears, that a Mini∣ster's Life, is set at a great Distance
<PB N="24" REF="010950_0024_0F85309685138B98"/>
from Indolence; admits of but little Va∣cation. Scarce any Man's Life so closely fill'd up with Duty and Exercise; not only of the stated Worship of God in Public, with diligent Reading and Study to prepare for that; but much of a more private Kind, visiting the Distressed in their various Sor∣rows; one <HI>Sick</HI> here, and another <HI>Dying</HI> there, and many Cases of Individuals to attend unto; that it may be eminently said of a Minister's Work, that <HI>'tis never done,</HI> as long as he lives, and is capable of it; and that old Age, will not excuse him from Application; while God keeps up his Ca∣pacity for it.—His Work is great <HI>all his Life through,</HI> as he is to be <Q>giving him∣self wholly to these Things,</Q> which be∣long to the ministerial Office, that he may <Q>fulfil the Ministry, he has received of the Lord Jesus,</Q> instructing Men truly in the great Points of Religion, and labouring both their Edification and Establishment in the Truth, &amp;c. And when he comes near the close of his Life and Ministry; how desirable, that this be adorn'd with the most evident Marks of Grace, of Faithfulness and Success. Thus, tho' <Q>his Beginning was Small, to have his latter End greatly Increased</Q> is Glorious: And even in
<PB N="25" REF="010950_0025_0F853096D5763F58"/>
his closing Days, he must not be negligent to put his People in Remembrance of those Things, they have heard; insist upon them over and over, with new Illustrations and more Proof, to fix them deep in their Minds; and so to stir them up most effec∣tually to the Christian Life: Yea, endea∣vour by all Means, they have these Things always in Remembrance, ready at Hand, for their own personal Benefit, and for the Defence of the Truth against Gainsayers. And though the Minister is shortly to put off this Tabernacle, and he has much to do, before it is dissolv'd, thrô Grace, to dress up with the Garments of Salvation, to stand compleat in Christ; waiting his Or∣der to go, when called, as a Servant wait∣eth the Order of his Master; yet, even then, when drawing near, to finish his Course; he must endeavour, to impress the Minds of his Hearers with the great Things of the Gospel; that they be able, after his Decease, to have them always in Remem∣brance.</P>
<P>II. USE. WE learn from the Premises, the great Duty of those that live under the Gospel, to attend faithfully to the preach∣ing of it. If Ministers must give them∣selves to this Work, and be all the Time
<PB N="26" REF="010950_0026_0F853097C381B868"/>
faithful in it; who then may, for trifling Excuses, forbear to attend unto a preached Gospel, or be inattentive to it, when they do attend. If the Minister must not, by any Means, be negligent to put his People always in Remembrance of pure Gospel; but it is of so much Worth to them, that he must be always setting it before them, as long as he lives; that they may not fail of the Benefit of it, when he can speak no more to them? then surely, it claims their most diligent Attention now, to have it ever with them. Oh think of it, with respect to the Doctrine of free-forgiveness of Sin, and Justification unto Life, by the all-avail∣ing Atonement, and perfect Obedience of Christ. May this be disregarded? Is this ever to be forgotten? or wholly out of Mind one Day? Can we pass a Day with∣out Sin? and what they do, one Day with∣out a Saviour, and unless we have these Things always in Remembrance? Very worthy then, of our Attention, with the View of laying them up in our Mind and Heart: Yes, surely; if the Apostle in the close of Life; when his Thoughts would be so full of his own personal Concerns; gathering in all needful Comfort in the View of Death; I say, if yet he esteem it
<PB N="27" REF="010950_0027_0F853098610CB950"/>
his Duty, and think it meet to lay out so much of the precious remains of his Time, for this End; to stir up others' Minds by way of Remembrance, and to the last; endeavour that they be able, after his De∣cease, to Profit by his Ministry, by having these Things, he was teaching them, al∣ways in Remembrance, ready for Use in Meditation, in Prayer, in religious Con∣verse, &amp;c. for strengthning of their Faith and Hope in God? Certainly then, this teacheth People to attend constantly and well on the Word preached; and to hear, as for their Lives; while they may; and with a View of their reaping the Advantage of it, after their Minister is gone from the Pulpit, to the Grave.</P>
<P>III. USE. WE hence learn, that 'tis a vain Curiosity which excites in People, an Itch of hearing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> always, something New; either as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Matter or Mode: Something <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is <HI>Novel,</HI> without proper Regard <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Truth,</HI> to <HI>Substance,</HI> and <HI>Impor∣tance.</HI> Indeed, to hear one Thing over and over, in Sermons, continually, in a short round of Sentiments; though they be Sound and Weighty, is not fitting; and can't relish well; when the Field is Wide, and many very important Things are to be
<PB N="28" REF="010950_0028_0F85309929E60F18"/>
spoken: And desirable it is, to have a va∣riety of Subjects, within the Compass of Orthodoxy and great Moment; and well handled. Yet, (I say,) to have such a Thirst for Novelty, as not to Care, whe∣ther what we hear, be <HI>True,</HI> if it be but <HI>New,</HI> or to nauseate old Truths, meerly because we have heard them, and known them before; is very wrong; and favours much of a vain Mind. The Apostle sup∣poseth Men to know the Truth, and to be established therein; and yet, to need being "put in Remembrance thereof." Men of pure Minds, may need, and be greatly Profited by this. So that, an Itch for new Things, for the sake of Novelty, is a vain Curiosity. Our Text will justify a Preach∣er's insisting much upon what the Apostle means by <HI>these Things,</HI> these important Doctrines, &amp;c. which are to be <HI>brought to Remembrance;</HI> and going over with them again and again, in the Course of his Mi∣nistry; But, the <HI>more</HI> with new turns of Thought and Expression, to the same Pur∣pose; to rivet these Things in Men's Minds; and the <HI>more</HI> with new illustrations and enforcements of the Subjects, to give them a more lively Impression on the Heart; <HI>the better.</HI> This is all well: and what
<PB N="29" REF="010950_0029_0F853099D04999F8"/>
the Apostle intends, by putting Men that had heard the Gospel, always in Remem∣brance of the same Things for Substance; which they had known and believed before.</P>
<P>IV. USE. If there be so much Stress laid upon putting People in Remembrance of the important Things, they had heard; that the Apostle thought it meet to do it, as long as he lived; and however much he had done at instructing them well, in the Course of his Ministry; yet, and in the close of his Life, to make it his Business, to put them in Remembrance of these Things; then it follows, as a just Infer∣renee, that there are many, who, after a Sort, hear them now; that think little of their Excellence, and of the vast Importance of their attending duly unto them, to lay them up for their Advantage hereafter. I say, think little of this, through the long Day of their Opportunity; ah, little of this, till their Day is over, not only for hearing them, from this, or that Minister; but for attending to them at all. For, they let the Candle of their Life, under the Means of Grace, sweal away, by their own abuse and neglect thereof. O how reprehensory and awakning is this? that the Apostle,
<PB N="30" REF="010950_0030_0F85309AD9EC90F0"/>
in the short Time he had to live, before he must suffer Martyrdom, and die on the Cross; I say, the short Time he had now, when old; to think of this, and have his own Heart well brac'd up to meet it; and be in the most ample readiness for Heaven: That yet, even then, he wou'd endeavour by all Means, that others, after his Decease, always have these Things in Remembrance, to their own everlasting Advantage. Verily it reproves, and may justly startle such, as do yet, after all Means used with them, <HI>neglect the great Salvation,</HI> and stupidly spend their Life in Sin; or in worldly Con∣cerns, to the neglect of <HI>the one Thing need∣ful.</HI></P>
<P>V. USE. WE see here, what is one great End of all good Preaching the Word, and Writing on divine Subjects: It is, <HI>to excite Men to right Practice,</HI> the Apostle's Aim in all he said and wrote; instructing People in the Truth, and putting them in Remembrance of those Things which they had been taught; was <HI>to stir them up,</HI> to their Duty, to receive the Truth most fully into their Hearts, and obey it in all Things; to excite in them a just Concern, to be approved of God as the upright. Yea, he neglected not to stir up the purest Minds
<PB N="31" REF="010950_0031_0F85309B5F445178"/>
by way of Remembrance: to put them upon exercising themselves unto Godliness in all the lovely Branches of it; to love God supremely, to love the Lord Jesus Christ in simplicity, and most exemplary godly since∣rity; and to love one another fervently; and thus, <HI>fulfil the Law of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>WELL now, having giv'n some Account, from our Text, of the Duty of Christ's Ministers, in the Course of their Ministry to be insisting on the great Doctrines and Duties of the Gospel: and yet in the close of their Life, to be putting People in Re∣membrance of these Things. May I not on this Occasion, in the FIRST PLACE, humbly say, That through the Grace of God, <HI>I have not shunned</HI> <Q>to declare the whole Counsel of God unto you.</Q> Are you not my Witnesses, that in some good Mea∣sure, I have preach'd both <HI>the Law</HI> and <HI>the Gospel,</HI> in their Place, and with their Views. The <HI>Law</HI> as the great Means of convincing Men of their Sin and Misery; as by it, is <HI>the knowlege of Sin.</HI> And as the Rule of Life, the obligations of which, being Moral and of perpetual Force, yet lie upon us; and in this View, fitted to give Men con∣viction of <HI>Sin;</HI> as <HI>that,</HI> is the want of Con∣formity unto, and Transgression thereof:—
<PB N="32" REF="010950_0032_0F85309C16195D28"/>
And preach'd the <HI>Gospel of Jesus Christ,</HI> as "the Grace of God bringing Salvation," opening and proving the great Doctrines of Grace—the nature and necessity of Re∣generation—the only Way of Forgiveness and Justification by the atonement and obedience of Christ, <Q>the Lord our Righ∣teousness</Q>—together with the necessity of Holiness, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>next Place,</HI> observe, this is still my Duty (as aforesaid) to put you in Re∣membrance of these Things: Which I trust, you will (every Way) incourage me in; that you may be able, after my Decease, to have them in Remembrance, to your own Advantage. The Reasons to urge me to Faithfulness in this, are chiefly the Glory of God and your Salvation; which are intimately concerned herein. But then, my Life and Opportunity, which remains for this; is very short; and my Concern for you, after I am gone, ne'er the less. Besure, that you hold fast the Faith and Order of the Gospel, and be well esta∣blish'd in the Truth, and obedient to it; you and your Children after you. God only knows, how it will be with you hereafter. But I think it meet, as long as I am with you; and in a Measure capable of it, to stir
<PB N="33" REF="010950_0033_0F85309D78DA7950"/>
you up, to all Attention and Regard to the Truth, by putting you in Remembrance thereof; that you may never be easy, with∣out a sound, pious, learned, faithful, heart∣searching and edifying Ministry: The which, you will the more likely be blessed with; by how much the better Attention and Regard, you give to divine important Things now; and have them well fixed in your Minds, for the establishment of <Q>your Faith and Love, which is in Christ Jesus.</Q> For, the manifest Declension of a People in Point of Principles and Practice, in one Generation; makes Way for a growing Corruption thereof in the following Generations.</P>
<P>FOR AS MUCH then, as it is my Duty, in some Imitation of the Apostle, to stir up your Minds, (even the purest of them) by Way of Remembrance of these Things, to fix and establish you well in them; you will suffer me to Remark upon the Impor∣tance of <HI>this Remembrance,</HI> which is a Kind of <HI>Capital Word,</HI> in Scripture; much used there, as expressing what is of great Con∣sequence.</P>
<P>AS for Instance; what is the <HI>doing</HI> this and that, at the Lord's Supper, eating of the Bread, and drinking of the Cup there,
<PB N="34" REF="010950_0034_0F85309E2D6C8E28"/>
without doing this, <HI>in Remembrance</HI> of Christ? This, is essential to the Duty of attending that Institution, and to our Ad∣vantage by it.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The Words which Christ had spoke (to the Disciples) in his Sermons, (it seems) must be brought to <HI>their Remem∣brance:</HI> else, they don't fully Answer their Design. See John 14. 26. <Q>The Com∣forter—He shall teach you all Things, and bring all Things <HI>to your Remem∣brance,</HI> whatsoever I have said to you,</Q> that ye may have a more just and full Un∣derstanding of them, and be more Profited by them. And how did the Disciples fail of their Duty, and Suffer by <HI>not remem∣bring</HI> Christ's Words, respecting his Death and Resurrection, to apply them, for the strengthning of their Faith in him, &amp;c. But, when they <HI>recalled</HI> his Words, they answered the Purposes for which they were uttered. When Christ said, <Q>De∣stroy this Temple, (meaning his Body) and I will raise it up again the Third Day,</Q> at first his Disciples understood it not: But when he was risen from the dead, then <Q><HI>they remembred</HI> his Words, and believ'd the Scripture,</Q> and were confirmed in his being the MESSIAH. Joh.
<PB N="35" REF="010950_0035_0F85309F1B3CCF10"/>
2. 22. And when he was going up to Je∣rusalem in a kind of Triumph, amidst the Hosannas of the People, he observ'd to his Disciples a Passage of Prophecy, that related to him; <Q>Fear not Daughter of Zion, thy King cometh sitting on an Ass's Colt.</Q>—<Q>Now, these Things understood not his Disciples at the first; but, when Jesus was Glorified, then <HI>remembred they,</HI> that these Things were Written of him,</Q> and so were Establish∣ed, Joh. 12. 16. Thus <HI>were</HI> they, and Oh how many since <HI>are help'd</HI> in a distres∣sing Hour, by <HI>remembring Christ's Sayings.</HI> Ah! and brought to Repentance too by this Means—After <HI>Peter</HI> had denied Christ most shamefully, he is brought to Repentance, as <Q><HI>he called to Mind</HI> the Word, that Jesus said unto him, Before the Cock crow Twice, thou shalt de∣ny me Thrice; and when he thought thereon he Wept bitterly.</Q> And how is Repentance a genuine Thing in any, without calling to Remembrance our Sins: And what is Israel's God to them; who <HI>forget him?</HI> or what the Most High to such Youth, as <HI>remember him not</HI> so much, as in the Character of <HI>Creator?</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, What says <HI>Paul</HI> of the Charac∣ter
<PB N="36" REF="010950_0036_0F85309FCD756B58"/>
of <HI>a good Minister?</HI> See 1 Tim. 4. 6. <Q>If thou put the Brethren <HI>in Remembrance</HI> of these Things, thou shalt be a good Minister of Jesus Christ.</Q> And <HI>Peter</HI> you see, was eminently this good Minister: For, he would not be Negligent in this Matter by any Means; but, as long as he was in the Body, wou'd be stirring up People by putting them <HI>in Remembrance</HI> of those Things, and do all that he could, that after his Decease, they might <HI>not for∣get</HI> them. The good Opinion he had of some; that they knew, and were establish∣ed in the Truth, did not relax his Care of this Matter; yea, however much Charity he had for some, as Christians of great Simplicity, yet he writes these Epistles, as he says, 2 Pet. 3. 1. <Q>To stir up their <HI>pure Minds by way of Remembrance.</HI></Q> So that it is verily something of great Mo∣ment, that is here intended, and what every Minister is to be engaged in; and the rather, as the import of the Word, is so Magnified in Acts 10. 31. <Q>Thine Alms are had in <HI>Remembrance.</HI></Q> God Re∣members and Rewards them. And in Rev. 16. 19. <Q>Babylon came into <HI>Re∣membrance</HI> before God.</Q> He remem∣bred her Sins to Punish them. And if
<PB N="37" REF="010950_0037_0F8530A08CFD60E0"/>
the Most High, represents himself, as re∣membring Men's Virtues and their Vices; to Reward the one, and Punish the other? then surely, we are to call to Mind our Sins, to repent of them in Season, and escape Punishment: And to remember our Duty, what God says to us in his Word, to excite us to embrace the Faith of the Gospel, to believe in Christ, and be careful to maintain good Works; to obtain, thrô Grace in Christ, the Reward of the Faithful.</P>
<P>THESE Hints, respecting <HI>Remembrance,</HI> I have given to shew, that 'tis not enough, that we <HI>read</HI> and <HI>hear the Word,</HI> and appear to <HI>know it,</HI> and, be <HI>established</HI> therein; but we must <HI>have it always in Remembrance:</HI> as it were continually present with us. And to shew, that, 'tis no trifling Thing, which Ministers urge and take Pains in, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>To stir up their Hearers, by way of Re∣membrance.</Q> The <HI>Memory,</HI> (a Faculty or Power of Recollection) is of vast Ser∣vice to the Mind; well improv'd; especi∣ally, in Matters of Religion; as it looks up, and reviews what it had some Know∣lege of before; and now, by reviewing the same, hath deeper Impressions of it, made upon the Soul; and, to have <HI>Helps</HI> to Me∣mory,
<PB N="38" REF="010950_0038_0F8530A453BF34D0"/>
as faithful Ministers, (among others) to bring to Remembrance, is a great Be∣nefit. To be sure, the Apostle thought so, when he judges it <Q>meet, as long as he liv'd</Q> to labour this Matter.</P>
<P>AND not only is a Minister to put his People in Remembrance of the great <HI>Doctrines and Duties of Religion;</HI> but also, of the great <HI>Event of Death,</HI> which a∣waits all Men, and first or last will open to every one, a most clear view of the Importance of those Things.</P>
<P>SOME have once <HI>a Year</HI> given to the Congregation, the Number of their De∣ceased, in <HI>that Term,</HI> for the awakning of the Living. For the same Purpose, I will now, as near as I can, count to you, the Numbers of the Deceased here, in the Course of 50 Years. And learn ye, something, by the Voice from the Dead: i. e. <Q>So to Number your Days, that you may apply your Hearts to Wisdom.</Q></P>
<P>ACCORDING to some exact Account of the Deaths, in this Society, for a Number of Years together; including therein the extremes from 14 to 30 in a Year; it appears, there have Died of all Ages, about 20, in a Year, one with another.
<PB N="39" REF="010950_0039_0F8530A551125C80"/>
And in such Proportion as this:—From the Age of 70 and upwards, an 112. Of this first Class, many liv'd to above 80 Years; a few to above 90; and one,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Abigail Lathrop,</HI> who lived into her 104th Year. And on the completion of an 100, she had, at her Desire, a Century Sermon preach'd at her House, Jan. 13, 1732; when she appeared a most rare In∣stance of Piety and strength of Mind.</NOTE> to above an 100.—From the Age of 50, to 70, an 140; of this Class, many liv'd to above 60; and some, near 70.—From the Age of 30, to 50, there died, an 154: many of whom, as they died in the vigour of Life, so, in the midst of growing Usefulness; to the great Lamentation of Survivors.—From the Age of 20 to 30, about an 140: many of whom, were as hopeful, and promising to be great Blessings to the Church and Society, as those who now fill important Places therein.—From the Age of 14 to 20, have died about 70; a Number of whom, had they been spared in Life, might have filled it <HI>eminently</HI> well, according as they were the Hope and Joy of the Generation, in which they liv'd.—From the Infant of Days, to 14, there have died about

390: Some of which appeared to have an uncommonly sprightly Genius, and a promising turn of Mind; some of the most likely Branches of humane Nature, we had; full as Promising for their Age; as others, who are now, forward and useful in their's; who, if spared, might have been as great Bles∣sings in their Day, as any that now are so: which shews the great Loss, the Public may sustain in the Death of Children, as well as of Youth; in which Respect this Society has had great Brea∣ches, made therein, not soon forgotten. Now, by the Account I have given of Deaths, in this Society, from the Year—17, to this—67, in the several Ages; you see the Amount of the whole Num∣ber, is about 1000.—A great Number, for any one Person to have taken from his Charge by Death, and to have attended the Funeral of the greater Part of.</P>
<P>OH how much to be learn't by look∣ing into the Grave, and being put in Mind of the series of Deaths, of one Age and another; continually carrying off People into the <Q>House appointed for all living;</Q> and into another far distant State from that!</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="010950_0041_0F8530A6BA1AD8F0"/>
THE first Set of <HI>aged People,</HI> are all gone long ago. Thus, in every Age, is the propriety of them Words kept up, "Your Fathers, where are they?" The next Set are almost all gone, after them; which we continually learn, is "the Way of all the Earth:" And indeed, when People arrive to Three∣score and Ten, <HI>their Life is soon cut off▪</HI> and <HI>they fly away</HI> at once, as it were. Some of a <HI>middle Age</HI> have died; <Q>died in the full Strength of Body and Mind: and there is no Discharge in that War.</Q> And, may not some of this <HI>Class</HI> now living, also die in that Age? They are like a Company, a little be∣hind others in the same Road—There∣fore, "be ye also ready" is the Direct∣ion for them; and as it is said, <Q>they Die <HI>in Youth</HI></Q> so it has been; and may be even with the present Youth: Therefore, let them <Q>Remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth.</Q> Be early, and effectually Religious, have it fix'd in their Minds to be so. And that so many <HI>Children</HI> Die, who carry a great Proportion of the whole Num∣ber: it teacheth us, that <Q>all Flesh is
<PB N="42" REF="010950_0042_0F8530A76FEA1148"/>
Grass; and as the Flower of the Field, so, it fadeth.</Q></P>
<P>AND now, let the Remembrance of Deaths, so many; (which may serve to raise our Admiration of God's distin∣guishing Goodness to us, who survive;) really quicken us, to make a Business of living to God, more than ever.—That, <Q>living and dying we may be the Lord's.—</Q></P>
<P>'TIS now 51 Years, the 19th of last Month, O. S. since, at the invitation of the People here, I came to <HI>Norwich,</HI> which was then all <HI>one Society,</HI> except∣ing <HI>two</HI> Parishes just then set off; and now <HI>Eight.</HI> And, 50 Years, reckon∣ing by the Sabbaths, since I was Or∣dained a Pastor here. At the Time of my coming to Town, no small Cloud of Discouragement, appeared in the Way of any one's peaceable Set∣tlement, though mostly gone off, before I settled; as the Difficulties on Account of the People's former Divisions gra∣dually abated to clear the Way. Thrô God's goodness, and the best Advice, I was wholly kept from interesting my self in those Divisions. And those
<PB N="43" REF="010950_0043_0F8530A824A560D0"/>
Words, <Q>who made me a Judge, who made me a Divider?</Q> were then, and since, a good Guard to me, against taking in, with a Party. And as all were united in my Settling here; so, (as I have often said) I never could tell which, were most Friendly to me. The unhappy Discord that had been long in the Place, and among Breth∣ren, in a little Time, began to Subside; and more and more; till it became ge∣nerally undesirable to keep it up. And 'tis like, the more, and the sooner did those Difficulties wear away, by the in∣fluence of a good Work, which early then, discovered its self among them; as Persons' Minds were awakned, and some powerful Turn given them, to religious Matters; of which, some now alive, are Witnesses. And as Things, of a spiritual Nature, became generally the Topic of Conversation, and Mat∣ters of serious Enquiry; those that had been Matters of Contention drop'd, and disappeared.</P>
<P>WHEN I first came here, there was a beautiful Sight of venerable aged Fa∣thers, and many of them appearing
<PB N="44" REF="010950_0044_0F8530A8CD70CBC0"/>
much of the right puritan Stamp <Q>The hoary Head found in the Way of Righteousness.</Q> And as there is now some greater Number of the a∣ged, from 70, and upwards, than there was at that Time; the more these are found in the Imitation of them, in respect of Religion; the brighter the Aspect on the succeeding Generations.</P>
<P>THOSE of elder Life now, (but young then,) I began with in my Youth; and we are grown up together, and so the more naturally <Q>love as Bre∣thren.</Q> As I had your Fathers to Pray for me, to be a great Comfort, and Help to me, <HI>in my Youth,</HI> (of which the Elder now, are Witnesses, as they saw the Spirit and Way of their Fathers;) So, you will not fail, (I trust) to Pray for me, <HI>in my old Age;</HI> and be my Comfort and Help therein, as far as may be.—God was pleased to favour me in my Youth, in this, that I had the Esteem and Affection of the Fathers then; which, was a great Encouragement to me; especially, when so Sensible of the great

inequallity of such a Youth, to the great and arduous Work of the Mini∣stry: But, as they Pray'd much for me, and the Success of the Ministry to themselves and dear Posterity, it was animating: and I liv'd in their Hearts, and they in mine. And in that Re∣spect, very happy the Situation, for a great Number of Years: and well in∣deed, that it was so; for, I was with them in much Weakness, and sore Af∣fliction, in Person and Family,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not an entire Year of Health for 16 Years.</NOTE> in many the Years, of my former Part of Life: When signal Kindnesses were shewn me and my distressed first Wife,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">For the greatest Part of 16 Years, Bedrid, and Eight Years, uncapable of feeding her self; and other Ways, extreme Helpless, and much in extreme Pain.</NOTE> from some, (besides the general Sup∣port from the whole) whose former loving Kindnesses, (I trust,) have, the same Place in God's Book of Accounts, as <HI>Alms</HI> have; which are had in Re∣membrance by Him, to Reward them.</P>
<P>'TIS now, one Half Century, that
<PB N="46" REF="010950_0046_0F8530AA4ED0EC48"/>
I have been with you, in many Scenes of Trial; and in a long Series of Ser∣vice, which I hope has been, some labour of Love; and in a Measure to your Profit: And, trust, by the Grace of God, while I live, to <HI>seek you,</HI> rather than <HI>yours;</HI> as, I seriously think I have done: and, yet <HI>to Spend and be Spent for you.</HI> And may I not, Hope and Trust, (without a Shock to my Hope in the Matter) that the Spirit of the Fathers, wherein they followed God and Duty, will in every Respect dwell in, and influence the Children. So, shall I have the Comfort of such a good Spirit, and they the Blessing that at∣tends it.</P>
<P>WHEN I took the pastoral Office here; there were Eleven Male Mem∣bers of the Church, of its standing in the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Fitch'</HI>s Day, with about the same Number of Females. Also, there were at that Time, Fif∣teen Male Members, who had been admitted in the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Woodward'</HI>s Day; with the ordinary Proportion of Females. There have since been ad∣mitted, 330, of which an 124 have
<PB N="47" REF="010950_0047_0F8530AB418AAB28"/>
died; as almost all of them before∣mention'd; 410, have owned the Co∣venant, of which Number, 90 have afterwards join'd to the Church, in full Communion. 2050, have been Baptized here, in this Course of Fifty Years; of which Number, many have died in Infancy. Thus, Death spares no Sort or Age.</P>
<P>Now, among the Numbers, that have attended on the Means of Grace, more or less, these 2600 Sabbaths in these 50 Years; (besides a great Num∣ber of other public Occasions,) the Lord knows the Number and the Per∣sons who have receiv'd the Grace of God, to their Salvation; and who, through their Unbelief, have died in their Sins; or are in danger of De∣struction, as being yet in their Sins. For, to some, the Word preached, and the preachers of it, are <Q>a Savour of Life unto Life, and to others a Savour of Death unto Death.</Q></P>
<P>THAT the Number of the former Kind, may be happily Increased in the small proportion of Time, I have to be with you: let it be your Prayer,
<PB N="48" REF="010950_0048_0F8530ABCFE13750"/>
the same as some Time since made for me, in this Desk: <Q>That my latter End greatly increase.</Q> And amidst all other Decline, may there be a rich Increase of spiritual Know∣lege, Grace, Experience, Faithfulness and Success, to the Glory of God; to my own and your best Advantage.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED, I had in my Youth, the Encouragement which your Fathers, and the Grandfathers of some of you, gave me: who appear'd to Prize these very Things which I am to bring to your Remembrance. I hope, those who have "grown up with me," and their Children, who began Life, since I came here; will ever shew the Spirit of their pious Ancestors; to treat the Gospel with Esteem and Love: As also the Ministers thereof with that Regard in all Things, which the Gos∣pel requires. And may there not ever a Generation rise up, that know not the God of their Fathers; but, such as have the like precious Faith with them.</P>
<P>IT is a great Thing, to have the Religion of Jesus Christ, transmitted
<PB N="49" REF="010950_0049_0F8530AC9E421030"/>
from Generation to Generation, pure and uncorrupt; both as to the great Principles and permanent Institutions thereof, &amp;c. And that every Genera∣tion in their own Day, <Q>stand fast in the Liberty, Faith and Order of the Gospel:</Q> as those who take it well to be always put in Remembrance of these Things. And if the Discourse this Day, on the Remarkable Occasion thereof, has any good Tendency to this; then look we back to this Day hereafter; as to a Kind of <HI>Monument</HI> set up, to remind us of Fifty Years Experience; yea, of all former Testi∣monies of God's great Goodness to me and you; in upholding Christ's Mini∣stry, and preserving his Church through all Trials, from Dissolving, and falling a Prey to Error and Confusion. Yea, review all as in a Kind of <HI>Jubilee,</HI> which speaks out the Ground of Re∣joicing in God's Salvation, and of Praise to his great Name. And may the same, as looking forward, proclaim Liberty from Embarrasments to Religion, and greater Freedom in the Service of God for the future.</P>

AND, as I may justly think it Meet, while in this Tabernacle, to be remin∣ding you; especially, of the most Im∣portant Things; so I may agreeably now, (as a Specimen thereof) give you the following Advice.—<Q>Be tho∣roughly Engaged in searching the Scriptures, which testify of Christ, and shew the Way of Life by him.—Be much in Prayer, for the ho∣ly Spirit, to guide you (in the Use of the Scripture) into all Truth and Duty.—Be thorough in your Re∣pentance and Conversion to God. Take not up with slighty Appea∣rances thereof: Know, that by the Work of the Spirit in effectual Cal∣ling, the Man becomes a new Crea∣ture, created in Christ unto good Works.—Rest not short of an en∣tire Self-Dedication to God, and ap∣prehending the Righteousness of God, which is by Faith in Jesus Christ, for Justification unto Life. Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World, by the Sacrifice of himself, by his Obedi∣ence unto the Death of the Cross.
<PB N="51" REF="010950_0051_0F8530AE0DEADDC0"/>
—Despair of Salvation by the Works of the Law, in your own Persons.—Stedfastly View the Glory of the other Way, by Grace; where∣in, God hath made us accepted in the Beloved:—The Argument to fall in with this Way of Acceptance with God, is very great: From the glori∣ous <HI>Origin,</HI> free Grace; the Digni∣ty of the <HI>Medium,</HI> God's own belo∣ved Son: And so, from the <HI>high Security,</HI> it gives the Believer: As also, the everlasting <HI>high Relish</HI> he will have of it. On the Dignity, Sweetness, and Glory of this Way! More honorary to God, than to be Justified by Works of ours: As much more so, as the Lord from Heaven is more Honorable than an innocent Adam could have been, with all his Posterity, an unsinning Race. And therefore spoke with an Emphasis, in Praise of this new, and living Way of Acceptance with God. Eph. 1. 6. To the Praise of the Glory of his Grace, wherein he hath made us accepted—Of his own Grace, he hath made us so; which im∣plies
<PB N="52" REF="010950_0052_0F8530AED8E71388"/>
in it, <HI>a divine Influence,</HI> as well as <HI>a glorious Constitution.</HI>—Be then entirely Satisfied in the Gospel Way of Justification before God, and live by the Faith of the Son of God, the Life you now live in the Flesh.</Q></P>
<P>NOT knowing, but I may obtain Help of God, to continue with you, for more Service, tho' but for a little while; shall I earnestly Invite you, to take the Advantage of my confirm'd Health and Strength, in further Ser∣vice for your Souls; which, I know, it concerns me to improve this Way.</P>
<P>THERE is a large, an attentive, and animating Assembly of you, who meet here for public Worship, as, the So∣ciety is large, and the People greatly increased. Every Class, from Children, to aged People, seem to be multiply'd.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">From the Age of 50, to 70, now, above 100 Persons: And from 70, and upwards, near 40; all advanc'd, and some far advanc'd in the Road to the Grave; unto dying Work, new Work; and to be done but once;—and gloriously done by such as Die in the Lord.</NOTE> But, if you should fail of keeping
<PB N="53" REF="010950_0053_0F8530B00977F340"/>
up a general Attendance, on social pub∣lic Worship, and other Branches of Religion, which will fail in Proportion as this doth; it may be said, as in Isai. 9. 3. <Q>Thou hast multiplied the Nation, and not increased the Joy.</Q> There is <HI>much in the Gospel of Christ,</HI> and in the divine Worship that we attend on, to animate us to the Attendance. And <HI>a Multitude</HI> that go to the House of the Lord together, seriously, harmoniously, &amp;c. do animate one another.—<Q>By all Means, be ye animated to attend; yea, univer∣sally, and more faithfully and de∣voutly than ever, to the Word preach∣ed.</Q>—</P>
<P>AND here now, shall I for my self and you, <Q>by the Grace of God, a∣dopt the Language of Psal. 132. And say, as there, Recorded; We will go into his Tabernacle, we will Worship at his Footstool; Arise, O Lord, into thy Rest, thou and the Ark of thy Strength: Let thy Priests be cloathed with Righteousness, and, let thy Saints shout for Joy; for the Lord hath chosen Zion, he hath
<PB N="54" REF="010950_0054_0F8530B05174B830"/>
desired it for his Habitation. This is my Rest for ever, and here will I dwell, for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her Provision, I will satisfy her Poor with Bread.—You will then suffer me to go on with my Advice to the Congregation at large; and say, Acquaint now thy self with God, one and all, and be at Peace, thereby <HI>good shall come unto thee;</HI> all <HI>the good</HI> of Peace.—Peace with God, Peace of Consci∣ence,—and Peace among your selves. Oh how Glorious thus to be at Peace? Yea, to be engaged, in ear∣nest, to pursue, and happily possess mutual Love and Esteem; abiding Harmony, and Peace in Community, Civil and Religious. As represented in Psal. 133. Behold how good and how Pleasant it is, for Brethren to dwell together in Unity: It is like the precious Ointment used for a sacred Officer of old; of sweet Perfume. And as the Dew de∣scending upon the Mountains of Zi∣on, to refresh them,—for there the Lord commandeth the Blessing:
<PB N="55" REF="010950_0055_0F8530B10E6155E0"/>
<HI>good indeed,</HI> to be of this Disposition, and in that Situation, where the eter∣nal God, the great Father of Bles∣sing, doth command it, ah and that, which in the End, doth come to be Life for ever-more. This is glorious indeed; some Resemblance of Heaven.</Q>—</P>
<P>Now, whatever failure of this mutual Esteem, Love and Peace, &amp;c. there hath ever been here; God saw it, and was much Displeased with it: and you have been the Sufferers. And in whatever Degree, this christian Affection and Har∣mony hath since been, and now is; God is Witness, and approves of it; whose Approbation it is, that determines the Worth of any Thing in, and among us, and done by us, pleasing unto him. But whatever Peace and good Agree∣ment, we now live in: <Q>Still the Advice is, be more and more intent upon it; to live in Love and Peace, always following Holiness with it.</Q></P>
<P>LOVE, and Peace! of what impor∣tance and sacred Worth is this? it is honoured with God's having a Chara∣cter
<PB N="56" REF="010950_0056_0F8530B26F35CCD8"/>
to this Purpose, God is Love. The God of Peace: and Christ, he is our Peace: And Peace it self comprehends all good. As in Joh. 14. 27. <Q>My Peace I give unto you,</Q> that is every Thing: Yea, put for the Crown of all that is called good. As express'd in that glorious Benediction—<Q>Grace, Mercy, and Peace be multiplied to you.</Q> So, let it be now, and here∣after so let it be, through my Days, and all succeeding Generations, for e∣ver.</P>
