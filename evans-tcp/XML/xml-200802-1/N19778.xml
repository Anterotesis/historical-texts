<HEAD>AN ESTIMATE OF THE RELIGION OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE general design of these pages is to offer some cursory remarks on the present state of religion among a great part of the polite and the fashionable; not only among that description of per∣sons who, whether from disbelief, or whatever other cause, avowedly neglect the duties of Christianity; but among
<PB N="2" REF="025845_0008_0FCF414657ED1770"/>
that more decent class also, who, while they acknowledge their belief of its truth by a public profession, and are not inat∣tentive to any of its forms, yet exhibit little of its spirit in their general temper and conduct: to shew that Christianity, like its divine Author, is not only <HI>denied</HI> by those who in words disown their sub∣mission to its authority; but <HI>betrayed</HI> by still more treacherous disciples, even while they say, <HI>Hail, Master!</HI></P>
<P>For this visible declension of piety va∣rious reasons have been assigned, some of which however do not seem fully adequate to the effects ascribed to them. The author of a late popular pamphlet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hints to an Association, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> has accounted for the increased profliga∣cy of the <HI>common people,</HI> by ascribing it, very justly, to the increased dissoluteness of their superiors: and who will deny that the general conduct of high and
<PB N="3" REF="025845_0009_0FCF414E2D86A1F0"/>
low, receives a deep tincture of depra∣vity from the growing neglect of public worship? I must however take the liber∣ty to dissent from his opinion as to the cause of that neglect; and to suspect that the too common desertion of per∣sons of rank from the service of the Esta∣blishment is not occasioned, in general by their disapprobation of the Liturgy; but that the far greater part of them are deterred from going to church, by mo∣tives far removed from speculative ob∣jections and conscientious scruples.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to enter the un∣pleasant and boundless fields of contro∣versy; an enterprise for which it would be hard to say whether I have less ability or inclination. Far be it from me to stand forth the fierce champion of a Li∣turgy, or the prejudiced advocate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forms and systems. A sincere member of the Establishment myself, I respect
<PB N="4" REF="025845_0010_0FCF414FAA693D20"/>
its institutions without idolatry, and acknowledge its imperfections without palliation.</P>
<P>But the difference of opinion here in∣timated is not so much about the Liturgy itself, as its imagined effects in thinning the pews of our people of fashion. The slightest degree of observation seems to contradict this assertion: those however who maintain the other opinion may sa∣tisfy their doubts, by enquiring whether the regular and systematic absenters from the church are chiefly to be found among the thinking, the reading, the speculative, and the scrupulous part of mankind.</P>
<P>Even the most negligent attendant on public worship must know, that the ob∣noxious creed, to whose malignant po∣tency this general desertion is ascribed, is never read above three or four Sun∣days in the year; and that does not seem
<PB N="5" REF="025845_0011_0FCF4151E1F2A4B0"/>
a very adequate reason for banishing the most scrupulous and tender consciences from church on the other eight-and-for∣ty Sundays.</P>
<P>Besides, there is one test which is ab∣solutely unequivocal—it is never read at all in the <HI>afternoon,</HI> any more than the Litany (another great source of offence); and yet, with all these multiplied reasons for their attendance, that is a season when the pews of the fashionable world are not <HI>remarkable</HI> for being crowded.</P>
<P>On the contrary, is it not pretty evi∣dent that the general quarrel (with some few exceptions) of those who habitually absent themselves from public worship, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not with the Creed, but the Command∣ments? With such, to reform the Prayer Book would go but a little way, unless the New Testament could be also abridg∣ed. Cut, and pare, and prune the ser∣vice of the Church ever so much, still
<PB N="6" REF="025845_0012_0FCF4153272B6B88"/>
Christianity itself will be found full of formidable objections. With such ob∣jectors, it would avail but little that the Church should give up her abstruse creeds, unless the Bible would expunge those rigorous laws, which not only pro∣hibit sinful actions, but corrupt inclina∣tions. And, to speak honestly, I do not see how such persons as habitually in∣fringe the laws of virtue and sobriety, and who yet are men of acute sagacity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>customed on other subjects to a consi∣stent train of reasoning; who see con∣sequences in their causes; who behold practical self-denial necessarily involved in the sincere habit of religious obser∣vances—I do not see how, to such men, any doctrines reformed, any redundan∣cies lopped, any obscurities brightened, could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffect this author's very benevolent and christian wish.</P>
<P>For religious duties are often neglected, upon more consistent grounds than the
<PB N="7" REF="025845_0013_0FCF41549BA750B0"/>
friends of religion are willing to allow. They are often discontinued, not as re∣pugnant to the understanding, not as re∣pulsive to the judgment, but as hostile to a licentious life. And when a pru∣dent man, after entering into a solemn convention, finds that he is living in a constant breach of every article of the treaty he has engaged to observe; one cannot much wonder at his getting out of the hearing of the heavy artillery which he knows is planted against him, and against every one who lives in an al∣lowed infraction of the covenant.</P>
<P>A man of sense, who should acknow∣ledge the truth of the doctrine, would find himself obliged to submit to the force of the precept. It is not easy to be a comfortable sinner; without trying, at least, to be a confirmed unbeliever. The smallest remains of faith would embitter a life of libertinism; and to him who
<PB N="8" REF="025845_0014_0FCF41561697B8D0"/>
retains any impression of Christianity, the wildest festivals of intemperance will be converted into the terrifying feast of Damocles: the suspended sword may every moment fall.</P>
<P>That many a worthy nonconformist is kept out of the pale of the Establish∣ment by some of the causes noticed in the pamphlet in question, cannot be doubted; and that many candid mem∣bers of that Establishment regret the causes which exclude the others, cannot be denied. But these are often sober thinkers, serious enquirers, conscienti∣ous reasoners; whose object is truth, and who spare no pains in search of what they take to <HI>be</HI> truth. But that the same objections banish the great and the gay, is not equally evident. Thanks to the indolence and dissipation of the times, it is not dogmas or doctrines, it is not ab∣stract reasoning or puzzling propositions,
<PB N="9" REF="025845_0015_0FCF415D8F999378"/>
it is not perplexed argument or intricate metaphysics, which can now disincline from Christianity; so far from it, they cannot even allure to unbelief. Infidel∣ity itself, with all that strong and natu∣ral bias which passion and appetite have in its favour, if it appear in the grave and scholastic form of speculation, ar∣gument, or philosophical deduction, may lie almost as quietly on the shelf as its most able antagonist; and the cobwebs are almost as seldom brushed from Hob∣bes as from Hooker. No: prudent scepticism has wisely studied the temper of the times, and skilfully felt the pulse of this relaxed and indolent age. It pru∣dently accommodated itself to the reign∣ing character, when it adopted sarcasm instead of reasoning, and preferred a sneer to an argument. It discreetly judged, that, if it would now gain pro∣selytes, it must shew itself under the be∣witching
<PB N="10" REF="025845_0016_0FCF415FC38B64F8"/>
form of a profane bon mot; must be interwoven in the texture of some amusing history, written with the levity of a romance, and the point and glitter of an epigram: it must embellish the ample margin with some offensive anec∣dote or impure allusion, and decorate impiety with every loose and meretrici∣ous ornament of a corrupt imagination: it must break up the old flimsy system in∣to little mischievous aphorisms, ready for practical purposes: it must divide the rope of sand into little portable parcels, which the shallowest wit can compre∣hend, and the shortest memory carry a∣way.</P>
<P>Philosophy therefore (as Unbelief, by a patent of its own creation, has lately been pleased to call itself) will not do nearly so much mischief to the present age, as its great apostles intended: since it requires time, application, and patience
<PB N="11" REF="025845_0017_0FCF416159591ED8"/>
to peruse the reasoning veterans of the sceptic school; and these are talents not now very severely devoted to study of any sort, by those who give the law to fashion; especially since, as it was hint∣ed above, the same principles may be ac∣quired on cheaper terms, and the repu∣tation of being philosophers obtained without the sacrifices of pleasure for the severities of study; since the indu∣stry of our literary chemists has extract∣ed the spirit from the gross substance of the old unvendible poison, and exhibited it in the volatile essence of a few sprightly sayings.</P>
<P>If therefore, in this voluptuous age, when a frivolous and relaxing dissipation has infected our very studies, infidelity will not be at the pains of deep research and elaborate investigation, even on such subjects as are congenial to its affecti∣ons, it is vain to expect that christianity
<PB N="12" REF="025845_0018_0FCF4162E24E3230"/>
will be more engaging, either as an ob∣ject of speculation, or a rule of practice, when its evidences require attention to be comprehended, its doctrines humili∣ty to be received, and its precepts self-denial to be embraced.</P>
<P>Will it then be uncharitable to pro∣nounce, that the leading evil, not which thins our churches (for that is not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil I propose to consider) but which per∣vades our whole character, and gives the colour to our general conduct, is <HI>practical irreligion?</HI> an irreligion not so much op∣posed to a speculative faith, as to that spirit, temper, and behaviour which chris∣tianity inculcates.</P>
<P>On this practical irreligion it is pro∣posed to offer a few hints. After at∣tempting to shew, by a comparison with the religion of the great in preceding ages, that there is a visible decline of piety
<PB N="13" REF="025845_0019_0FCF416477E60B18"/>
among the higher ranks—that even those more liberal spirits who neglect not many of the great duties of benevolence, yet hold the several obligations of piety in no esteem—I shall proceed, to remark on the notorious <HI>effects</HI> of the decay of this religious principle, as it corrupts our mode of education, infects our do∣mestic conduct, spreads the contagion downwards among servants and inferi∣ors, and influences our manners, habits▪ and conversation.</P>
<P>But what it is here proposed princi∣pally to insist on is, that this defect of religious principles is almost equally fa∣tal, whether it appear in the open con∣tempt of all sacred institutions, or under the more decent veil of external obser∣vances, unsupported by such a conduct as is analogous to the christian profession.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="025845_0020_0FCF4165DAE9B5A0"/>
I shall proceed with a few remarks on a third class of fashionable characters, who profess to acknowledge christianity as a perfect system of morals, while they deny its divine authority: and conclude with some slight animadversions on the opinion which these maintain, that mo∣rality is the whole of religion.</P>
<P>It must be confessed, however, that manners and principles act reciprocally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> each other; and are, by turns, cause and effect. For instance—the increased relaxation of morals, produces the in∣creased neglect of infusing religious prin∣ciples in the education of youth: which effect becomes, in its turn, a cause; and in due time, when that cause comes to operate, helps on the decline of manners.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Decline of christianity shewn by a compara∣tive view of the religion of the great in preceding ages.</HEAD>
<P>IF the general position of this little tract be allowed, namely, that religion is at present in no very flourishing state among those, whose example, from the high ground on which they stand, guides and governs the rest of mankind: it will not be denied by those, who are ever so superfi∣cially acquainted with the history of our country, that this has not always been the case. Those who make a fair com∣parison must allow, that however the present age may be improved in other important and valuable advantages, yet that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is but little appearance remain∣ing among the great and the powerful of that "lighteousness which exalteth a na∣tion;"
<PB N="16" REF="025845_0022_0FCF416D2734E168"/>
—that there has been a <HI>moral revo∣lution</HI> in the national manners and prin∣ciples, very little analogous to that great <HI>political</HI> one of which we hear so much; that our public virtue bears little propor∣tion to our public blessings, and that our religion had decreased in a pretty ex∣act proportion to our having secured the means of enjoying it.</P>
<P>That the antipodes to wrong are hard∣ly ever right, was very strikingly illus∣trated about the middle of the last cen∣tury, when the fiery and indiscreet, zeal of one party was made a pretext for the profligate impiety of the other; who, to the bad principle which dictated a de∣praved conduct, added the bad taste of being proud of it:—when even the least abandoned were absurdly apprehensive that an appearance of decency might subject them to the charge of fanaticism, a charge in which they took care to in∣volve
<PB N="17" REF="025845_0023_0FCF416F19E568E8"/>
real piety as well as enthusiastic pretence; till it became the general fa∣shion to avoid no sin but hypocrisy, to dread no imputation but that of serious∣ness, and to be more afraid of a good re∣putation than of every vice which ever earned a bad one.</P>
<P>It was not till piety was thus unfortu∣nately brought into disrepute, that persons of condition thought it made their sincer∣ity, their abilities, or their good breeding questionable, to appear openly on the side of religion. A strict attachment to piety did not subtract from a great reputation. Men were not thought the worse law∣yers, generals, ministers, legislators, or historians, for believing, and even defend∣ing, the religion of their country. The gallant Sir Philip Sidney, the rash but heroic Essex, the politic and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>cious
<PB N="18" REF="025845_0024_0FCF417068DB2EC8"/>
Burleigh, the all-accomplished Falkland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Falkland assisted the great Chilling worth in his incomparable work, The Religion of a Pro∣testant.</NOTE>, not only publicly owned their belief in christianity, but even wrote some things of a religious nature<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See that equally elegant and authentic work, <HI>The Anecdotes of Royal and Noble Authors.</HI></NOTE>. These instances, and many others which might be adduc∣ed, are not, it will be allowed, selected from among contemplative recluses, grave divines, or authors by profession; but from busy men of strong passions, beset with great temptations; distin∣guished actors on the stage of life; and whose respective claims to the title of fine gentlemen, brave soldiers, or able statesmen, have never been called in question.</P>
<P>What would the Hales, and the Cla∣rendons, and the Somers's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This consummate statesman was not only re∣markable for a strict attendance on the public duties o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> religion, but for maintaining them with equal ex∣actness in his family, at a period too, when religion was most discountenanced.</NOTE> have said,
<PB N="19" REF="025845_0025_0FCF41720E4342A8"/>
had they been told that the time was at no great distance, when that sacred book, for which they thought it no derogation from their wisdom or their dignity to entertain the profoundest reverence, would be of little more use to men in high public stations, than to be the in∣strument of an oath, and that the subli∣mest rites of the christian religion would soon be considered as little more than a necessary qualification for a place, or the legal preliminary to an office.</P>
<P>This indeed is the boasted period of free enquiry and liberty of thinking, and a noble subject of boasting it is. But it is the peculiar character of the present age, that its mischiefs often assume the most alluring forms: and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most alarming evils not only look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like good∣ness,
<PB N="20" REF="025845_0026_0FCF4178F0602BA8"/>
as to be often mistaken for it; but are sometimes mixed up with so much real good, as often to disguise, though never to counteract, their malignity. Under the beautiful mask of an en∣lightened philosophy, all religious re∣straints are set at nought; and some of the deadliest wounds have been aimed at christianity, in works written in avowed vindication of the most amia∣ble of all the christian principles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See particularly <HI>Voltaire s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r la Tolerance.</HI> This is a common artifice of that engaging but insidious author. In this instance he has made use of the po∣pularity he obtained in the fanatical tragedy at Thoulouse (the murder of Calas) to discredit, though in the most guarded manner, christianity itself; de∣grading martyrdoms▪ denying the truth of the Pagan persecutions, &amp;c. &amp;c. And by mixing some truths with many falsehoods, by assuming an amiable can∣dour, and professing to serve the interests of good∣ness, he treacherously contrives to leave on the mind of the unguarded reader, impressions the most unfa∣vourable to christianity.</NOTE>. Even the prevalence of a liberal and warm philanthropy, is secretly sapping the foundation of christian morals, because
<PB N="21" REF="025845_0027_0FCF417C183A02D8"/>
many of its champions allow themselves to live in the open violation of the se∣verer duties of justice and sobriety, while they are contending for the gen∣tler ones of charity and beneficence.</P>
<P>The strong and generous bias in fa∣vour of universal toleration, noble as the principle itself is, has engendered a dan∣gerous notion that all error is innocent. Whether it be owing to this, or to what∣ever other cause, it is certain that the discriminating features of the christian religion are every day growing into less repute; and it is become the fashion, even among the better sort, to evade, to lower, or to generalize, its most distin∣guishing peculiarities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is so little of the Author of christianity left in his own religion, that an apprehensive believ∣er is ready to exclaim▪ with the woman at the sepul∣chre▪ "They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him." The locality of Hell, and the existence of an Evil Spirit, are an∣nihilated, or considered as abstract ideas. They are never named without some periphrasis or cir∣cumlocution; as if the very names, instead of being awful and terrible, were only vulgar and illiberal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="025845_0028_0FCF417D37EA9B10"/>
Having wisely and happily freed our∣selves from the trammels of human au∣thority, are we not turning our liberty into licentiousness, and wantonly strug∣gling to throw off the <HI>divine</HI> authority too? Freedom of thought is the glory of the human mind, while it is confined within its just and sober limits; but though we are accountable for <HI>opinions</HI> at no earthly tribunal, yet it should be remembered, that thoughts as well as actions are amenable to the bar of God: and though we may rejoice that the ty∣ranny of the spiritual Procrustes is so far annihilated, that it is no longer thought a proof of the orthodoxy of one man's opinions, that he lop or lengthen those of another till they fit his own measure; yet there is still a stand∣ard by which not only actions are weigh∣ed,
<PB N="23" REF="025845_0029_0FCF417E981BDC18"/>
but opinions are judged, and every sentiment which is clearly inconsistent with the revealed will of God, is as much throwing off <HI>his</HI> dominion, as the breach of any of his moral precepts.</P>
<P>There is then surely one test by which it is no mark of intolerance to try the principles of men, namely, the <HI>Law and the Testimony:</HI> and it is impossible not to lament, that while a more gene∣rous spirit governs our judgment, a purer principle does not seem to regu∣late our lives. May it not be said, that while we are justly commended for thinking charitably of the opinions of others, we seem, in return, as if we were desirous of furnishing them with an opportunity of exercising their can∣dour, by the laxity of principle in which we indulge ourselves? If the hearts of men are as firmly united to each other by the bond of charity, as
<PB N="24" REF="025845_0030_0FCF418024A7BA60"/>
some pretend, they could not fail of being united to God also, by one com∣mon principle of piety, the only certain source of all charitable judgment, as well as of all virtuous conduct.</P>
<P>Instead of abiding by the salutary precept of <HI>judging no man,</HI> it is the fashion to exceed our commission, and to fancy every body to be in a safe state. But, in forming our notions, we have to choose between the Bible and the world, between the rule and the prac∣tice. Where these do not agree, it is left to the judgment, of believers at least, by which we are to decide. But we never act, in religious concerns, by the same rule of common sense and equitable judgment which governs us on other occasions. In weighing any commodity, its weight is determined by some generally-allowed standard; and if the commodity be heavier or lighter
<PB N="25" REF="025845_0031_0FCF4181B1623640"/>
than the standard weight, we add to or take from it: but we never break, or clip, or reduce the weight to suit the thing we are weighing; because the common consent of mankind has agreed that the one shall be considered as the standard to ascertain the value of the other. But, in weighing our princi∣ples by the standard of the Gospel, we do just the reverse. Instead of bringing our opinions and actions to the <HI>balance of the sanctuary,</HI> to determine and rectify their comparative deficiencies, we lower and reduce the standard of the scripture doctrines till we have accommodated them to our own purposes; so that, in∣stead of trying others and ourselves by God's unerring rule, we try the truth of God's rule by its conformity or non∣conformity to our own depraved notions and corrupt practices.</P>

principles; that the unparalleled in∣stances of charity, of which we are continual witnesses; that the many strik∣ing acts of public bounty, and the vari∣ous new and noble improvements in this shining virtue, justly entitle the present age to be called, by way of eminence, <HI>the age of benevolence.</HI></P>
<P>It is with the liveliest joy I acknow∣ledge the delightful truth. Liberality flows with a full tide through a thou∣sand channels. There is scarcely a news∣paper but records some meeting of men of fortune for the most salutary purposes. The noble and numberless structures for the relief of distress, which are the ornament and the glory of our metropo∣lis, proclaim a species of munificence unknown to former ages. Subscriptions, not only to hospitals, but to various other valuable institutions, are obtained almost as soon as solicited. And who
<PB N="28" REF="025845_0034_0FCF418785B84B60"/>
but must wish that these beautiful mo∣numents of benevolence may become every day more numerous, and more extended.</P>
<P>Yet with all these allowed and ob∣vious excellencies, it is not quite clear whether something too much has not been said of the liberality of the present age, in a comparative view with that of those ages which preceded it. A gene∣ral alteration of habits and manners has at the same time multiplied public boun∣ties and private distress; and it is scarce∣ly a paradox to say, that there was probably less misery when there was less munificence.</P>
<P>If an increased benevolence now ranges through, and relieves a wider compass of distress; yet still, if those examples of luxury and dissipation which promote that distress, are still <HI>more</HI> in∣creased,
<PB N="29" REF="025845_0035_0FCF4189160056E8"/>
this makes the good done bear little proportion to the evil promoted. If the miseries removed by the growth of charity fall, both in number and weight, far below those which are caus∣ed by the growth of vice and disorder; if we find, that though bounty is extend∣ed, yet, that those corruptions which make bounty so necessary, are extended also, almost beyond calculation; if it appear that, though more objects are relieved by our money, yet incompara∣bly more are debauched by our licenti∣ousness—the balance perhaps will not turn out so decidedly in favour of the times as we are willing to imagine.</P>
<P>If then the most valuable species of charity is that which prevents distress by preventing or lessening vice, the great∣est and most inevitable cause of want; we ought not so highly to exalt the bounty of the great in the present day,
<PB N="30" REF="025845_0036_0FCF418AC7C63FE8"/>
in preference to that broad shade of pro∣tection, patronage, and maintenance, which the wide-spread bounty of their forefathers stretched out over whole villages, I had almost said whole pro∣vinces. When a few noblemen in a country, like a few of their own stately oaks (paternal oaks! which are not oft∣en set upon a card), extended their sheltering branches to shield all the un∣derwood of the forest—when there exist∣ed a kind of passive charity, a negative sort of benevolence, which did good of itself; and without effort, exertion, or expence, performed the best functions of bounty, though it did not aspire to the dignity of its name—it was simply this:—great people staid at home; and the sober pomp, and orderly magnificence of a noble family, residing at their own castle great part of the year, contributed in the most natural way to the mainten∣ance of the poor; and in a good degree
<PB N="31" REF="025845_0037_0FCF418D9661A8F8"/>
prevented that distress, which it must however be thankfully confessed it is the laudable object of modern bounty to re∣lieve. A man of fortune might not then, it is true, so often dine in public, for the benefit of the poor; but the poor were more regularly and comfortably fed with the abundant crumbs which then fell from the rich man's table. Whereas it cannot be denied that the prevailing mode of living has pared real hospitality to the very quick: and, though the re∣mark may be thought ridiculous, it is a material disadvantage to the poor, that the introduction of the modern style of luxury has rendered the remains of the most costly table but of small value.</P>
<P>But even allowing the boasted superi∣ority of modern benevolence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it will not be inconsistent with the object of the present design, to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>re whether the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>usion of this branch of charity,
<PB N="32" REF="025845_0038_0FCF41909D8FFA58"/>
though the most lovely offspring of reli∣gion, be yet any positive proof of the prevalence of religious principles: and whether it is not the fashion rather to consider benevolence as a substitute for christianity, than as an evidence of it.</P>
<P>For it seems to be one of the reigning errors among the better sort, to reduce all religion into benevolence, and all benevolence into alms-giving. The wide and comprehensive idea of christian cha∣rity is compressed into the slender com∣pass of a little pecuniary relief. This species of benevolence is indeed a bright gem among the ornaments of a christian; but by no means furnishes all the jewels of his crown, which derives its lustre from the associated radiance of every christian grace. Besides, the genuine virtues are all of the same family; and it is only by being seen in company with each other, and with Piety their com∣mon
<PB N="33" REF="025845_0039_0FCF419235E001E8"/>
parent, that they are certainly known to be legitimate, for there are such things as even spurious virtues.</P>
<P>But is this the property of the <HI>christian</HI> virtues, that, like all other amiable mem∣bers of the same family, while each is doing its own particular duty, it is con∣tributing to the prosperity of the rest; and the larger the family the better they live together, as no one can advance it∣self without labouring for the advance∣ment of the whole: thus, no man can be benevolent on christian principles, without self-denial; and so of the other virtues: each is connected with some other, and all with religion.</P>
<P>I already anticipate the obvious and hackneyed reply, that "whoever be the instrument, and whatever be the motive of bounty, still the poor are equally re∣lieved, and therefore the end is the same." And it must be confessed, that those
<PB N="34" REF="025845_0040_0FCF419641DBA1B8"/>
compassionate hearts, who cannot but be earnestly anxious that the distressed should be relieved at any rate, should not too scrupulously enquire into any cause of which the effect is so benefici∣al. Nor indeed will candour scrutinize too curiously into the errors of any life, of which benevolence will always be al∣lowed to be a shining ornament, while it does not pretend to be an atoning vir∣tue.</P>
<P>Let me not be misrepresented, as if I were seeking to detract from the value of this amiable feeling; one does not surely lower the practice by seeking to ennoble the principle; the action will not be impaired by mending the motive: and no one will be likely to give the poor less, because he seeks to please God more.</P>
<P>One cannot then help wishing that pecuniary bounty were not only practis∣ed,
<PB N="35" REF="025845_0041_0FCF419938F09960"/>
but sometimes enjoined too, as a redeeming virtue. In many conversa∣tions, I had almost said in many chari∣ty sermons, it is insinuated as if a little alms-giving could pay off old scores con∣tracted by favourite indulgences. This, though often done by well-meaning men to advance the interests of some present pious purpose, yet has the mischievous effect of those medicines which, while they may relieve a local complaint, are yet undermining the general habit.</P>
<P>That great numbers who are not in∣fluenced by so high a principle as chris∣tianity holds out, are yet truly com∣passionate, without hypocrisy, and with∣out ostentation, who can doubt? since there are by nature many tender hearts; for did not God make them? and is he not the Author of all that is good in nature, as well as in grace.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="025845_0042_0FCF419C81830620"/>
But who that feels the beauty of be∣nevolence, can avoid being solicitous, not only that its offerings should com∣fort the receiver, but return in blessings to the bosom of the giver, by springing from such motives, and being accompa∣nied by such a temper as shall redound to his eternal good? For that the bene∣fit is the same to the object, whatever be the character of the benefactor, is but an uncomfortable view of things to a real christian, whose compassion reach∣es to the souls of men. Such an one longs to see the charitable giver as hap∣py as he is endeavouring to make the object of his bounty; but such an one knows that no happiness can be fully and finally enjoyed but on the solid ba∣sis of christian piety.</P>
<P>For as religion is not, on the one hand, merely an opinion or a sentiment; so neither is it, on the other, merely an
<PB N="37" REF="025845_0043_0FCF419D6157B888"/>
act or a performance, but it is a dispo∣sition, a habit, a temper: it is not a name, but a nature: it is a turning the whole mind to God; a concentration of all the powers and affections of the soul in∣to one steady point, an uniform desire to please <HI>Him.</HI> This desire will naturally and necessarily manifest itself, in our doing all the good we can to our fellow-creatures in every possible way; for it will be found that neither of the two parts into which practical religion is di∣vided, can be performed with any degree of perfection but by those who unite both: as it may be questioned if any man really <HI>does</HI> <Q>love his neighbour as himself,</Q> who does not first endeavour to "love God with all his heart." As genius has been defined to be strong general powers of mind accidentally de∣termined to some particular pursuit; so piety may be denominated a strong ge∣neral disposition of the heart to every
<PB N="38" REF="025845_0044_0FCF41A27B6AB180"/>
thing that is right, breaking forth into every excellent action, as the occasion presents itself. The temper must be ready in the mind, and the whole heart must be prepared and trained to every act of virtue to which it may be called out. For religious principles are like the military exercise; they keep up an habitual state of preparation for actual service; and by never relaxing the dis∣cipline, the real christian is ready for every duty to which he may be com∣manded. Right actions best prove the existence of religion in the heart; but they are evidences, not causes.</P>
<P>Whether therefore a man's charitable actions proceed from religious principle, he will be best able to ascertain by scru∣tinizing into what is the general dispo∣sition of his time and fortune; and by attending to such an habitual regulation of his pleasures and expences as will en∣able
<PB N="39" REF="025845_0045_0FCF41A36DC03FF0"/>
him to be more or less useful to others.</P>
<P>For it is in vain that he may possess, what is called by the courtesy of fashion <HI>the best heart in the world</HI> (a character we every day here applied to the liber∣tine and the prodigal), if he squander his time and estate in such a round of ex∣travagant indulgencies, and thoughtless dissipation, as leaves him little money and less leisure for nobler purposes. It makes but little difference whether a man is prevented from doing good by hard∣hearted parsimony, or an unprincipled extravagance; the stream is equally cut off.</P>
<P>The mere <HI>casual</HI> benevolence of any man can have little claim to solid esteem; nor does any charity deserve the name which does not grow out of a steady conviction that it is his bounden duty, which does not spring from a settled pro∣pensity
<PB N="40" REF="025845_0046_0FCF41A4E37531B8"/>
to obey the whole will of God; which is not therefore made a part of the general plan of his conduct; and which does not lead him to order the whole scheme of his affairs with an eye to it.</P>
<P>He therefore who does not habituate himself to certain interior restraints, who does not live in a regular course of self-renunciation, will not be likely often to perform acts of beneficence, when it be∣comes necessary to convert to such pur∣poses any of that time or money which appetite, temptation or vanity solicit him to divert to other purposes.</P>
<P>And surely he who seldom sacrifices one darling indulgence, who does not subtract one gratification from the inces∣sant round of his enjoyments, when the indulgence would obstruct his capacity of doing good, or when the sacrifice would enlarge his power, does not de∣serve
<PB N="41" REF="025845_0047_0FCF41A683A3BF58"/>
the name of benevolent. And for such an unequivocal criterion of charity to whom are we to look, but to the con∣scientious christian? No other spirit but that by which he is governed, can subdue self-love: and where self-love is the pre∣dominant passion, benevolence can have but a feeble, or an accidental dominion.</P>
<P>Now if we look around and remark the excesses of luxury, the costly diver∣sions, and the intemperate dissipation in which numbers of professing christians indulge themselves, can any stretch of candour, can even that tender sentiment by which we are enjoined "to hope" and to "believe all things," enable us to hope and believe that such are actuated by a spirit of christian benevolence, mere∣ly because we see them perform some casual acts of charity, which the spirit of the world can contrive to make ex∣tremely compatible with a voluptuous
<PB N="42" REF="025845_0048_0FCF41A7DF7FE378"/>
life, and the cost of which, after all, bears but little proportion to that of any one vice, or even vanity?</P>
<P>Men will not believe that there is hardly any one human good quality which will know and keep its proper bounds, without the restraining influence of religi∣ous principle. There is, for instance, great danger lest a constant attention to so right a practice as an invariable oecono∣my should incline the heart to the love of money. Nothing can effectually counteract this natural propensity, but the christian habit of devoting those re∣trenched expences to some good pur∣pose; and then oeconomy, instead of narrowing the heart, will enlarge it, by inducing a constant association of benevo∣lence with frugality. An habitual atten∣tion to the wants of others, is the only wholesome regulator of our own expen∣ces, and carries with it a whole train of
<PB N="43" REF="025845_0049_0FCF41A95A7306D0"/>
virtues, disinterestedness, sobriety, and temperance. And those who live in the custom of levying constant taxes on their vanities for such purposes, serve the poor still less than they serve themselves, by cultivating such habits as make the best qualification for their final happiness.</P>
<P>Thus when a vein of christianity runs through the whole mass of a man's life, it gives a new value to all his actions, and a new character to all his views. It transmutes prudence and oeconomy into christian virtues; and every offering that is presented on the altar of charity, be∣comes truly consecrated, when it is the gift of obedience, and the price of self-denial. Piety is the fire from heaven, which can alone kindle the sacrifice, and make it acceptable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when any act of bounty is performed by way of composi∣tion with one's Maker, either as a pur∣chase,
<PB N="44" REF="025845_0050_0FCF41ABEF40E4B0"/>
or an expiation of unallowed in∣dulgencies; though even in this case, God (who makes all the passions of men sub∣servient to his good purposes) can make the gift equally beneficial to the receiv∣er: yet it is surely not too severe to say, that to the giver such acts are an un∣founded dependance, a deceitful refuge, a broken staff.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The neglect of religious education both a cause and consequence of the decline of christia∣nity. No moral restraints—Religion on∣ly incidentally taught, not as a principle of action. A few of the causes which dispose the young to entertain low opinions of religion.</HEAD>
<P>LET not the truly serious be offend∣ed, as if, in the present chapter, which
<PB N="45" REF="025845_0051_0FCF41AF9B712198"/>
is intended to treat of the notorious ne∣glect of religious education, I meant to confine the spirit of christianity to mere∣ly mechanical effects, and to suppose that piety must be the natural and inevitable consequence of early institution. To imply this, would be indeed to betray a lamentable ignorance of human nature, of the disorder sin has introduced, of the inefficacy of human means, and entirely to mistake the genius of our religion. It would be to suppose that God was to de∣pend upon <HI>our</HI> goodness, and not upon <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>Yet it must be allowed that the Su∣preme Being works chiefly by means; and though it is confessed that no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of education, no corruption of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> can place any one out of the reach of the divine influences (for it is under such circumstances, perhaps, that the most extraordinary instances of divine grace have been manifested); yet it must be
<PB N="46" REF="025845_0052_0FCF41B258C5D7B8"/>
owned, that early sobriety, early know∣ledge of religion, and early habits of pie∣ty, are the most probable means of se∣curing the favour of God. To acquire these, is putting ourselves in the way in which he himself has told us his blessing is to be found.</P>
<P>But religion is the only thing in which we seem to look for the end, without making use of the means: and yet, it would not be more suprising if we were to expect that our children should be∣come artists and scholars, without being bred to arts and languages, than it is to look for a christian world, without a christian education.</P>
<P>The noblest objects can yield no de∣light, if there be not in the mind a dispo∣sition to enjoy them, arising from an in∣telligence of their nature, and a rever∣ence for their value, which can only
<PB N="47" REF="025845_0053_0FCF41B671645D08"/>
spring from long habit and early acquaint∣ance. For to produce any capacity of enjoyment, there must be a congruity between the mind and the object. To the mathematician demonstration is plea∣sures; to the philosopher the study of nature; to the voluptuous the gratifica∣tion of his appetite; to the poet the plea∣sure of his imagination. These objects they all respectively pursue as their prop∣er business, as pleasures adapted to that part of their nature which they have been accustomed to indulge and cultivate.</P>
<P>Now, as men will be apt to act consist∣ently with their general views and ha∣bitual tendencies, would it not be absurd to expect that the philosopher should look for his sovereign good at a ball, or the sensualist in the pleasures of intellect or piety? None of these ends are an∣swerable to the general views of the re∣spective pursuer; they are not correspond∣ent
<PB N="48" REF="025845_0054_0FCF41B795593D90"/>
to his ideas; they are not commen∣surate to his aims. The sublimest plea∣sures can afford little gratification where a previous taste has not been cultivated. A clown, who should hear a scholar or an artist talk of the delights of a library, a picture gallery, or a concert, could not guess at the nature of the pleasures they afford; nor would his being introduced to them give him much clearer ideas, because he would bring to them an eye blind to proportion, an understanding new to science, and an ear deaf to har∣mony.</P>
<P>Shall we expect then, since men can only be scholars by sedulous labour, that they shall be christians by mere chance? Shall we be surprised if those do not ful∣fil the offices of religion, who are not trained to an acquaintance with them? And will it not be obvious, that it must be some other thing besides the abstruse∣ness
<PB N="49" REF="025845_0055_0FCF41BCF3DD34D8"/>
of creeds and opinions, which makes christianity unfashionable?</P>
<P>For it will not probably be disputed, that in no age have the passions of youth been so early freed from the <HI>muzzle of re∣straint;</HI> in no age has the paternal au∣thority been so contemptuously treated, or every species of subordination so dis∣dainfully trampled on. All the shades of discrimination in society seem to be melt∣ing into each other. In no age has im∣prudent fondness been so injuriously la∣vish, or the supernumerary expences of the coiledge and the school (that prolific seed of corruption) been so prodigally augmented. In no age have the appetites been excited by such early stimulants, and anticipated by such premature indul∣gencies. Never was the shining gloss, the charming novelty of life so early worn off from all enjoyment by excessive use. Never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> simple and youthful pleasures
<PB N="50" REF="025845_0056_0FCF41BF52F06380"/>
so early lost their power over the mind▪ nor was ever one great secret of virtue and happiness, the secret of being cheap∣ly, pleased, so little understood.</P>
<P>A taste for costly, or artificial, or tu∣multuous pleasures cannot be gratified, by their most sedulous pursuers, at eve∣ry moment; and what wretched manage∣ment is it in the oeconomy of human hap∣piness so to contrive, as that the enjoy∣ment shall be rare and difficult, and the intervals long and languid! Whereas real and unadulterate pleasures occur perpetually to him who cultivates a taste for truth and nature, and science and vir∣tue. But these simple and tranquil en∣joyments cannot but be insipid to him, whose passions have been prematurely excited by agitating pleasures, or whose taste has been depraved by such as are debasing and frivolous; for it is of more consequence to virtue than some good
<PB N="51" REF="025845_0057_0FCF41C18B7430A0"/>
people are willing to allow, to preserve the taste pure, and the judgment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound. A vitiated intellect has no small con∣nection with depraved morals.</P>
<P>Since amusements of some kind are necessary to all ages (I speak now with an eye to mere human enjoyment,) why should it not be as proper to tether man as other animals? Why should not he too be confined, in different stages of life, to certain restricted limitations? since nothing but experience seems to teach him, that if he be allowed to anti∣cipate his future posessions, and trample all the flowery fields of real, as well as imaginary and artificial enjoyment, he not only induces present disgust, but de∣faces and destroys all the rich materials of his future happiness; and leaves him∣self, for the rest of his life, nothing but ravaged fields and barren stubble.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="025845_0058_0FCF41C30A37CC88"/>
But the great and radical defect, and that which comes more immediately within the present design, seems to be, that in general the characteristical prin∣ciples of christianity are not early and strongly infused into the mind: that re∣ligion is rather taught incidentally, as a thing of subordinate value, than as the leading principle of human actions, and the great animating spring of human con∣duct. Were the high influential princi∣ples of the christian religion anxiously and early inculcated, we should find that those lapses from virtue, to which passi∣on and temptation afterwards too fre∣quently solicit, would be more easily re∣coverable.</P>
<P>For though the evil propensities of fal∣len nature, and the bewitching allure∣ments of pleasure, will too often seduce even those of the best education into de∣vious paths, yet we shall find that men
<PB N="53" REF="025845_0059_0FCF41C48963EA58"/>
will seldom be <HI>incurably</HI> wicked, without that internal corruption of principle, which knows how to justify iniquity, and confirm evil conduct, by the sanction of corrupt reasoning.</P>
<P>The errors occasioned by the violence of passion may be reformed, but systema∣tic wickedness will be only fortified by time; and no decrease of strength, no decay of appetite, can weaken the power of a pernicious principle. He who com∣mits a wrong action indeed, puts himself out of the path of safety; but he who adopts a false principle, not only throws himself into the enemy's country, but burns the ships, breaks the bridge, cuts off every retreat by which he might hope one day to return into his own.</P>
<P>Surely it will subject no one to the imputation of bigotry or enthusiasm, if he venture to enquire whether the ge∣nuine
<PB N="54" REF="025845_0060_0FCF41CA2738C580"/>
doctrines of christianity are made the standard by which our young men of fashion are commonly taught to try their principles, or to weigh their acti∣ons; or whether some more popular standard, of custom, or fashion, or world∣ly opinion, be not too frequently allowed to supersede them? Whether some idol of false honour be not consecrated for them to worship? Whether, even among the better sort, reputation be not held out as a motive of sufficient energy to produce virtue, in a world where yet the greatest vices are every day practised openly, which do not at all obstruct the reception of those who practise them in∣to the best company? Whether resent∣ment be not ennobled, and pride, and many other passions, erected into hon∣ourable virtues—virtues not less repug∣nant to the genius and spirit of christiani∣ty, than obvious gross vices? Will it be
<PB N="55" REF="025845_0061_0FCF41CD63C2C130"/>
thought impertinent to enquire if the awful doctrines of a perpetually present Deity, and a future righteous judgment, are early impressed, and lastingly engrav∣en, on the hearts and consciences of our high-born youth?</P>
<P>Perhaps, if there be any one particu∣lar in which we fall remarkably below the politer nations of antiquity, it is in that part of education which has a refer∣ence to purity of mind, and the disci∣pline of the heart.</P>
<P>For the great secret of religious edu∣cation, and which seems banished from the present practice, consists in training young men to an habitual interior re∣straint, an early government of the af∣fections, and a course of self-controul over those tyrannizing inclinations, which have so natural a tendency to enslave the human heart. Without this habit of moral restraint, which is one of the fun∣damental
<PB N="56" REF="025845_0062_0FCF41D029B32FA8"/>
laws of christian virtue, though men may, from natural temper, often <HI>do</HI> good, yet it is perhaps impossible that they should ever <HI>be</HI> good. Without the vi∣gorous exercise of this controuling prin∣ciple, the best dispositions, and the most amiable qualities, will go but a little way towards establishing a virtuous charac∣ter. For the best dispositions will be ea∣sily overcome by the concurrence of pas∣sion and temptation, in a heart where the passions have not been accustomed to this wholesome discipline: and the most amiable qualities will but more ea∣sily betray their possessor, unless the yielding heart be fortified by repeated acts, and long habits, of resistance.</P>
<P>In this, as in various other instances, we may blush at the superiority of Pagan institution. Were the Roman youth taught to imagine themselves always in the awful presence of Cato, in order to
<PB N="57" REF="025845_0063_0FCF41D12380D248"/>
habituate them betimes to supress base sentiments, and to excite such as were generous and noble? And should not the christian youth be continually reminded, that a greater than Cato is here? Should they not be trained to the habit of acting under the constant impression, that <HI>He</HI> to whom they must one day be account∣able for intentions, as well as words and actions, is witness to the one as well as the other; that he not only is "about their paths," but "understands their very thoughts?"</P>
<P>Were the disciples of a Pagan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pythagoras.</NOTE> lead∣er taught that it was a motive sufficient to compel their obedience to any rule, whether they liked it or not, that it had the authority of their teacher's name? were the bare words, <HI>the master hath said it,</HI> sufficient to settle all disputes, and
<PB N="58" REF="025845_0064_0FCF41D29FCF14E8"/>
to subdue all reluctance? And shall the schollars of a more divine teacher, who have a code of laws written by God him∣self, be contented with a lower rule, or abide by a meaner authority? And is any argument drawn from human consider∣ations likely to operate more forcibly on a dependant being, than that simple but grand assertion, with which so many of the precepts of our religion are introduc∣ed—Because, THUS SAITH THE LORD?</P>
<P>For it is doing but little, in the infu∣sion of first principles, to obtain the bare assent of the understanding to the exist∣ence of one Supreme Power, unless the heart and affections go along with the conviction, by our conceiving of that power as intimately connected with our∣selves. A feeling temper will be but little affected with the cold idea of a <HI>geo∣metrical</HI> God, as the excellent Pascal ex∣presses it, who merely adjusts all the
<PB N="59" REF="025845_0065_0FCF41DA5C2CEFB8"/>
parts of the matter, and keeps the ele∣ments in order. Such a mind will be but little moved, unless he be taught to consider his Maker under the interesting and endearing representation which re∣vealed religion gives of him. That "God is," will be to him rather an a∣larming than a consolatory idea; till he be persuaded of the subsequent proposi∣tion, that "he is the rewarder of all such as diligently seek him." Nay, if natural religion does even acknowledge one awful attribute, that "God is just;" it will only increase the terror of a ten∣der conscience, till he learn, from the fountain of truth, that he is, "the justi∣fier of all who believe on him."</P>
<P>But if the great sanctions of our reli∣gion are not deeply engraven on the heart, where shall we look for a more adequate curb to the fiery spirit of youth? For, let the elements be ever so kindly
<PB N="60" REF="025845_0066_0FCF41DBB5C7BB10"/>
mixed in a human composition, let the natural temper be ever so amiable, still whenever a man ceases to think himself an accountable, being what motive can he have for resisting a strong temptation to a present good, when he has no dread that he shall thereby forfeit a greater future good?</P>
<P>But it will be objected, that this deep sense of religion would interfere with the general purposes of education, which is designed to qualify men for the busi∣ness of human life, and not to train up a race of monks and ascetics.</P>
<P>There is however so little real solidity in this specious objection, that I am firmly persuaded, that if religious prin∣ciples were more deeply impressed on the heart, even the things of this world would be much better carried on. For where are we to look for so much punc∣tuality, diligence, application, doing eve∣ry
<PB N="61" REF="025845_0067_0FCF41DE9E6B1C00"/>
thing in its proper day (the great hinge on which business turns), as among men of principle? Oeconomy of time, truth in observing his word, never daring to deceive or to disappoint—these are the very essence of a man of business; and for these to whom shall we most natural∣ly look? Who is so little likely to be "slothful in business," as he who is "fervent in spirit?" Will not he be most regular in dealing with men, who is most diligent in "serving the Lord?"</P>
<P>But, it may be said, allowing that religion does not necessarily spoil a man of <HI>business,</HI> yet it would effectually de∣feat those accomplishments, and coun∣teract that fine breeding, which essenti∣ally constitute the <HI>gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>This again is so far from being a na∣tural consequence, that, supposing all the other real advantages, of parts and
<PB N="62" REF="025845_0068_0FCF41E0266AF218"/>
education, to be equally taken into the account, there is no doubt but that, in point of true politeness, a real christian would beat the world at its own wea∣pons, the world itself being judge.</P>
<P>For though it must be confessed, that, in the present state of things, other wickedness has made dissimulation ne∣cessary; and that being the case, there is scarcely any one invention for which we are more obliged to mankind than for that of politeness, as there is perhaps no screen in the world which hides so many ugly sights: yet while we allow that there never was so admirable a sup∣plement to real goodness, as good breed∣ing; it is however certain that the prin∣ciples of christianity put into action, would necessarily produce more genuine politeness than any maxims drawn from motives of human vanity or convenience. If <HI>love, peace, joy, long-suffering, gentle∣ness,
<PB N="63" REF="025845_0069_0FCF41E1F1275020"/>
patience, goodness,</HI> and <HI>meekness</HI> may be thought instruments to produce sweet∣ness of manners, these we are expressly told are "the fruits of the Spirit." If mourning with the afflicted, rejoicing with the happy, if "to esteem others better than ourselves;" if "to take the lowest room;" if "not to seek our own;" if "not to behave ourselves unseemly;" if "not to speak great swelling words of vanity"—if these are amiable, engag∣ing and polite parts of behaviour; then would the documents of Saint Paul make as true a fine gentleman as the <HI>Courtier of Castiglione,</HI> or even the <HI>Letters of Lord Chesterfield</HI> himself. Then would simu∣lation, and dissimulation, and all the nice shades and delicate gradations of passive and active deceit, be rendered superflu∣ous; and the affections of every heart be won by a shorter and a surer way, than by the elegant obliquities of this
<PB N="64" REF="025845_0070_0FCF41E5B2369D40"/>
late popular preceptor; whose mischiefs have out lived his reputation; and who, notwithstanding the present just declen∣sion of his fame, has helped to relax the general nerve of virtue, and has left a taint upon the public morals, of which we are still sensible.</P>
<P>That self-abasement then, which is inseparable from christianity, and the external signs of which good breeding knows so well how to assume; and those charities which suggest invariable kindness to others, even in the smallest things, would, if left to their natural workings, produce that gentleness which it is one great object of a polite educa∣tion to imitate. They would produce it too without effort and without exerti∣on; for being inherent in the substance, it would naturally produce itself on the surface.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="025845_0071_0FCF41EA3292EA28"/>
For however useful the institution of polished society may be found, yet they can never alter the eternal difference between right and wrong; or convert appearances into realities; they cannot transform decency into virtue, nor make politeness pass for principle. And the advocates for fashioable breeding, should be humbled to reflect, that every con∣vention of artificial manners was invent∣ed not to <HI>cure,</HI> but to <HI>conceal,</HI> deformity: that though the superficial civilities of elegant life, tend to make this cortupt world a more tolerable place than it would be without them; yet they never will be considered as a substitute for truth and virtue by HIM who is to pass the definitive sentence on the characters of men.</P>
<P>Among the many prejudices which the young and the gay entertain against religion, one is, that it is the declared
<PB N="66" REF="025845_0072_0FCF41EC3B12C5B0"/>
enemy to wit and genius. But, says one of its wittiest champions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. South▪</NOTE>, "Piety en∣joins no man to be dull:" and it will be found, on a fair enquiry, that though it cannot be denied that irreligion has had able men for its advocates, yet they have never been the most able. Nor can any learned profession, any depart∣ment in letters or in science, produce a champion on the side of unbelief, but christianity has still a greater name to oppose it; philosophers themselves be∣ing judges.</P>
<P>But while the young adopt an opi∣nion, from one class of writers, that religious men are weak; they acquire, from another, a notion that they are ri∣diculous: and this opinion, by mixing itself with their common notions, and deriving itself from their very amuse∣ments,
<PB N="67" REF="025845_0073_0FCF41EE5CA947C0"/>
is the more mischievous as it is received without resistance or suspicion.</P>
<P>One common medium through which they take this false view is, those fa∣vourite works of wit and humour, so captivating to youthful imaginations, where no small part of the author's suc∣cess perhaps has been owing to his dex∣terously introducing a pious character, with so many virtues, that it is impos∣sible not to love him, yet tinctured with so many absurdities, that it is impossible not to laugh at him. The reader's me∣mory will furnish him with too many instances of what is here meant. The slightest touches of a witty malice can make the best character ridiculous. It is effected by any little aukwardness, ab∣sence of mind, an obsolete phrase, a for∣mal pronunciation, a peculiarity of gesture. Or if such a character be brought, by unsuspecting goodness, and
<PB N="68" REF="025845_0074_0FCF41F123926E18"/>
trusting honesty, into some foolish scrape, it will stamp an impression of ridicule so indelible, that all his worth shall not be able to efface it: and the young who do not always separate their ideas very carefully, shall ever after, by this early and false association, conceive of piety as having something essentially ridicu∣lous in itself.</P>
<P>But one of the most infallible arts, by which the inexperienced are engaged on the side of irreligion, is, that popular air of candour, good nature, and tolera∣tion, which it so invariably puts on. While, on the one hand, sincere piety is often accused of moroseness and seve∣rity, because it cannot hear the doctrines on which it founds its eternal hopes, de∣rided without emotion; indifference or unbelief, on the other hand, purchase the praise of candour at an easy price, because they neither suffer grief, nor
<PB N="69" REF="025845_0075_0FCF41F2DA24C790"/>
express indignation, at hearing the most awful truths ridiculed, or the most so∣lemn obligations set at nought.</P>
<P>The scoffers whom young people hear talk, and the books they hear quoted, falsely charge their own injurious opini∣ons on christianity, and then unjustly accuse her of being the monster they have made. They dress her up, with the sword of persecution in one hand, and the flames of intolerance in the other; and then ridicule the sober-mind∣ed for worshipping an idol which their misrepresentation has rendered as ma∣lignant as Moloch. In the mean time, they affect to seize on benevolence with exclusive appropriation as their own cardinal virtue, and to accuse of a big∣otted cruelty, that narrow spirit which points out the perils of licentiousness, and the terrors of a future account. And yet this benevolence, with all its
<PB N="70" REF="025845_0076_0FCF41F49A6C4C28"/>
tender mercies, is not afraid nor asham∣ed to endeavour at snatching away from humble piety, the comfort of a present hope, and the bright prospect of a felici∣ty that shall have no end. It does not however seem a very probable means of adding to the stock of human happiness, by plundering mankind of that principle, by the destruction of which friendship is robbed of its bond, society of its secu∣rity, patience of its motive, morality of its foundation, integrity of its reward, sorrow of its consolation, life of its balm, and death of its support.</P>
<P>It will not perhaps be one of the meanest advantages of a better state, that as the will shall be reformed, so the judgment shall be rectified; that "evil shall no more be called good," nor the "churl liberal;" nor the plunderer of our best possession, or principles, bene∣volent. Then it will be evident that
<PB N="71" REF="025845_0077_0FCF41FB2EB18D60"/>
greater violence could not be done to truth and language, than to wrest bene∣volence from christianity, her most ap∣propriate and peculiar attribute. If be∣nevolence be "good-will to men," it was that which angelic messengers were not thought too high to announce, nor a much higher being than angels too great to teach by his precepts, and to illustrate by his death: it was the crite∣rion, the very watch-word as it were, by which he intended his religion and his followers should be distinguished "By this shall all men know that ye are my dis∣ciples, if ye love one another." Besides, it is the very genius of christianity to ex∣tirpate all selfishness, on whose vacated ground, benevolence naturally and ne∣cessarily plants itself.</P>
<P>But not to run through all the parti∣culars which obstruct the growth of pie∣ty in young persons, I shall only name
<PB N="72" REF="025845_0078_0FCF41FE7A8BBB60"/>
one more. They hear much declama∣tion from the fashionable reasoners, against the contracted and selfish spirit of christianity—that it is of a sordid tem∣per, works for pay, and looks for re∣ward.</P>
<P>But this jargon of French philosophy, which prates of pure disinterested good∣ness, acting for its own sake, and equal∣ly despising punishment and disdaining recompence, indicates as little know∣ledge of human nature, as of christian revelation, when it addresses man as a being made up of pure intellect, without any mixture of passions, and who can be made happy without hope, and virtuous without fear.</P>
<P>A creature hurried away by the im∣pulse of some impetuous inclination, is not likely to be restrained (if he be re∣strained at all) by a cold reflection on the
<PB N="73" REF="025845_0079_0FCF42011FEF2008"/>
beauty of virtue. If the dread of offend∣ing God, and the incurring his everlast∣ing displeasure, cannot stop him, how shall a weaker motive do it? When we see that the powerful sanctions which re∣ligion holds out, are too often an ineffec∣tual curb: to think of attaining the same end by feebler means, is as if one should expect to make a watch go the better by breaking the main spring; nay, as ab∣surd as if the philosopher who inculcates the doctrine, should undertake with one of his fingers to lift an immense weight, which had resisted the powers of the crane and the lever.</P>
<P>On calm and temperate spirits indeed, in the hour of retirement, in the repose of the passions, in the absence of tempta∣tion, virtue does seem to be her own ade∣quate reward; and very lovely are the fruits she bears, in preserving health, cre∣dit, and fortune. But on how few will
<PB N="74" REF="025845_0080_0FCF42029807BFA8"/>
this principle act! and even on them, how often will its operation be suspend∣ed! And though virtue for her own sake, might have captivated softer hearts, which almost seem cast in a natural mould of goodness; yet no motive could, at all times, be so likely to restrain even these, under the pressure of temptation, as this simple assertion—<HI>For all this, God will bring me into judgment.</HI></P>
<P>But it is the beauty of our religion, that it is not held out exclusively to a few select spirits; that it is not an object of speculation, or an exercise of ingenuity, but a <HI>rule of life,</HI> suited to every condi∣tion, capacity, and temper. It is the glory of the christian religion to <HI>be,</HI> what it was, the glory of every pagan institu∣tion <HI>not</HI> to be, the <HI>religion of the people;</HI> and that which constitutes its characte∣ristic value, is its suitableness to the ge∣nius, condition, and necessities of all man∣kind.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="025845_0081_0FCF4204422C4640"/>
For with whatever obscurities it has pleased God to shadow some parts of his written word, yet he has graciously or∣dered, that whatever is necessary should be perspicuous also: and though "clouds and darkness are the habitation of his throne," yet they are not the medium through which he has left us to discover our duty. In this, as in all other points it has a decided superiority over all the ancient systems of philosophy, which were always in many respects impracti∣cable and extravagent, because not fram∣ed from observations drawn from a per∣fect knowledge "of what was in men." Whereas the whole scheme of the Gospel is accommodated to real human nature; laying open its mortal disease, present∣ing its only remedy; exhibiting rules of conduct, often difficult indeed, but but never impossible; and where the rule was so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the practicability seem∣ed desperate holding out a living pattern▪

to elucidate the doctrine, and to illustrate the precept: offering every where the clearest notions of what we have to hope, and what we have to fear; the strongest injunctions of what we are to believe; and the most explicit directions of what we are to do.</P>
<P>In short, whoever examines the wants of his own heart, and the appropriated assistance which the Gospel furnishes, will find them to be two tallies which exactly correspond—an internal evidence, stronger perhaps than any other, of the truth of revelation.</P>

<HEAD>Other symptoms of the decline of christianity—No family religion—Corrupt or negli∣gent examples of superiors—The self-de∣nying and evangelic virtues held in con∣tempt—Neglect of encouraging and pro∣moting religion among servants.</HEAD>
<P>IT was by no means the design of the present undertaking to make a general invective on the corrupt state of manners, or even to animadvert on the conduct of the higher ranks, but inasmuch as the corruption of that conduct, and the de∣pravation of those manners, appear to be a natural consequence of the visible de∣cline of religion.</P>
<P>Of the other obvious causes which contribute to this decline of morals little will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ Nor is the present a ro∣mantic attempt to restore the simplicity
<PB N="78" REF="025845_0084_0FCF420A2049F5F0"/>
of primitive manners. This is too lite∣rally an age of gold, to expect that it should be so in the poetical and figura∣tive sense. It would be unjust and ab∣surd not to form our opinions and ex∣pectations from the present general state of society. And it would argue great ignorance of the corruption which com∣merce, and conquest, and riches, and arts necessarily introduce into a state, to look for the same sober-mindedness, sim∣plicity, and purity among the <HI>dregs of Romulus,</HI> as the severe and simple man∣nere of elder Rome presented.</P>
<P>But though it would be an attempt of desperate hardihood, to controvert that maxim of the witty bard, that
<Q>To mend the world's a vast design;</Q>
yet to make the best of the times in which we live; to fill up the measure of our own particular, and individual duties; and to take care that the age shall
<PB N="79" REF="025845_0085_0FCF420C63ED1CF0"/>
not be the worse for our having been cast into it, seems to be the bare dictate of common probity, and not a romantic flight of impracticable perfection.</P>
<P>But is it then so very chimerical to imagine that the benevolent can be sob∣er-minded? Is it romantic to desire that the good should be consistent? Is it ab∣surd to fancy that what has once been practised, should not now be impractica∣ble?</P>
<P>It is impossible then not to help re∣gretting that it should be the general temper of many of the leading persons of that age which arrogates to itself the glorious character of the <HI>age of benevo∣lence,</HI> to be kind, and considerate, and compassionate, every where rather than at home: that the rich and the fashiona∣ble should be zealous in promoting reli∣gious, as well as charitable institutions
<PB N="80" REF="025845_0086_0FCF4213AD711E20"/>
abroad, and yet discourage every thing which looks like religion in their own families: that they should be at a consi∣derable expence in instructing the poor at a distance, and yet discredit piety a∣mong their own servants—those more immediate objects of every man's atten∣tion whom Providence has enabled to keep any; and for whose conduct he will be finally accountable, inasmuch as he has helped to corrupt it.</P>
<P>Is there any degree of pecuniary boun∣ty without doors which can counte∣ract the mischief of a wrong exam∣ple at home; or atone for that infec∣tious laxity of principle, which spreads corruption wherever its influence ex∣tends? Is not he the best benefactor to society who sets the best example, and who does, not only the most good, but the least evil? Will not that man, how∣ever liberal, very imperfectly promote
<PB N="81" REF="025845_0087_0FCF2CBC0EA21030"/>
virtue in the world at large, who neglects to disseminate the principles of it within the immediate sphere of his own person∣al influence, by a sober conduct and a blameless behaviour? Can a generous but profligate person atone by his purse for the disorders of his life, or expect a blessing on his bounties, while he defeats their effect by a profane conversation?</P>
<P>In moral as well as political treatises, it is often asserted, that it is a great evil to do no good: but it has not been per∣haps enough insisted on, that it is a great good to do no evil. This species of good∣ness is not ostentatious enough for popu∣lar declamation; and the value of this abstinence from vice is perhaps not well understood by christians, because it wants the ostensible brilliancy of actual per∣formance.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>principles</HI> of christianity are in no great repute, so their concomitant
<PB N="82" REF="025845_0088_0FCF42190562BD08"/>
<HI>qualities,</HI> the evangelical virtues, are pro∣portionably disesteemed. But those se∣cret habits of self-controul, those interi∣or and unobtrusive virtues, which excite no astonishment, kindle no emulation, and extort no praise, are yet the most dif∣ficult, and the most sublime, and, if chris∣tianity be true, will be the most graci∣ously accepted by <HI>him</HI> who witnesses the secret struggle and the silent victory: while the splendid deeds, which have the world for their witness, and immortal same for their reward, shall perhaps cost him who atchieved them, less than it costs a conscientious christian to subdue one irregular inclination; a conquest which the world will never know; and if it did, would probably despise.</P>
<P>For though great actions performed on human motives are permitted, by the great Disposer, to be equally benefi∣cial to society with such as are performed
<PB N="83" REF="025845_0089_0FCF4219DC6107A8"/>
on purer principles; yet it is an affect∣ing consideration, that, at the final adjust∣ment of accounts, the politician that <HI>rais∣ed</HI> a state, or the hero who <HI>preserved</HI> it, may miss of that favour of God, which, if it was not his motive, will probably not be his reward. And it is awful to reflect, as we visit the monuments justly raised by public gratitude, or the statues properly erected by well-earned admira∣tion, on what may be now the unaltera∣ble condition of the illustrious object of these deserved honours; and that he who has saved a state, may have lost his own soul.</P>
<P>A christian life seems to consist of two things, almost equally difficult; the adoption of good habits, and the excision of such as are evil. No one sets out on a religious course with a stock of native innocence, or actual freedom from sin; for there is no such state in human life.

The natural heart is not a blank paper, whereon the divine spirit has nothing to do but to stamp characters of good∣ness; but many blots and defilements are to be erased, as well as fresh impres∣sions to be made.</P>
<P>The vigilant christian therefore, who acts with an eye to the approbation of his Maker, rather than to that of man∣kind; to a future account, rather than to present glory; will find, that, dili∣gently to cultivate the "unweeded gar∣den" of his own heart; to mend the soil; to clear the ground of its indigenous vices, by practising the painful business of extirpation; will be that part of his duty which will cost him most labour, and bring him least credit: while the fair flower of one shewy action, produc∣ed with little trouble, and of which the pleasure is reward enough, shall gain him more praise than the eradication of the

<P>But the Gospel judges not after the manner of men; for it never fails to make the abstinent virtues a previous st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p to the right performance of the operative ones; and the relinquishing what is wrong to be a necessary prelude to the performance of what is right. It makes "ceasing to do evil" the indispensable preliminary to "learning to do well." It continually suggests that something is to be laid aside as well as to be practised. We must "hate vain thoughts" before we can "love God's law." We must lay aside "malice and hyprocrisy," to <HI>enable</HI> us "to receive the ingrafted word."—Having "a conscience void of offence;" abstaining from fleshly lusts," "bringing every thought into obedience"—these are actions, or rather negations, which, though they never will obtain im∣mortality
<PB N="86" REF="025845_0092_0FCF42203583F768"/>
from the chisel of the statuary, the declamation of the historian, or the panegyric of the poet, serve however to constitute the true christian temper, to promote heavenly mindedness, and to procure the divine favour.</P>
<P>And for our encouragment, it is ob∣servable that a more difficult christian virtue generally involves an easier one. An habit of self-denial in permitted plea∣sures easily induces a victory over such as are unlawful. And to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it loose to our own possessions, necessarily includes an exemption from coveting those of others; and so on of the rest.</P>
<P>Will it be difficult then to trace back to that want of early restraint noticed in the preceding chapter, that licence of behaviour which, having been indulged in youth, afterwards reigns uncontrouled in families; and having infected educa∣tion
<PB N="87" REF="025845_0093_0FCF4225E3135308"/>
in its first springs, taints all the streams of domestic virtue? Nor is it strange that that same want of religious principle which corrupted our children, should corrupt our servants.</P>
<P>We scarcely go into any company with∣out hearing some invective against the in∣creased profligacy of this order of men; and the remark is made with as great an air of astonishment, as if the <HI>cause</HI> of the complaint were not as visible as the <HI>truth</HI> of it. It would be endless to point out instances in which the increas∣ed dissipation of their betters (as they are oddly called) has contributed to the growth of this evil. But it comes only within the immediate design of the pre∣sent undertaking, to insist on the single circumstance of the almost total exter∣mination of religion in fashionable fami∣lies, as a cause, adequate of itself, to

<P>Is there not a degree of injustice in persons who discover strong indignation at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se crimes which crowd our pri∣sons, and furnish our incessant executi∣ons, and yet discourage not an internal principle of vice; since those crimes are nothing more than that principle put in∣to action? And it is no less absurd than cruel in such of the great as lead disor∣derly lives, to expect to prevent vice by the laws they make to restrain or punish it, while their own example is a perpe∣tual source of temptation to commit it. If by their own practice they demon∣strate that they think a vicious life is the only happy one, with what colour of jus∣tice can they inflict penalties on others, who, by acting on the same principle, expect the same indulgence?</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="025845_0095_0FCF4228D7A58B08"/>

and to respect an act of parliament next to a text of Scripture: yet he sees his honourable protector, publicly in his own house, engaged in the evening in play∣ing at a game expresly prohibited by the laws, and against which perhaps he him∣self had assisted in the day to pass an act.</P>
<P>While the contempt of religion was confined to wits and philosophers, the effect was not so sensibly felt. But we cannot congratulate the ordinary race of mortals on their emancipation from old prejudices, or their indifference to sacred usages; as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is not at all visible that the world is become happier in proportion as it is become more enlight∣ened.

<P>Is it not to be regretted therefore, while the affluent are encouraging so many admirable schemes for promoting religion among the children of the poor, that they do not like to <HI>perpetuate</HI> the principle, by encouraging it in their servants also?

Is it not impolitic indeed, as well as unkind, to refuse them any means of having im∣pressed on their consciences the opera∣tive principles of christianity? It is but little, barely not to <HI>oppose</HI> their going to church, or doing their duty at home, unless their opportunities of doing both are facilitated, by giving them, at cer∣tain seasons, as few employments as possible that may interfere with both. Even when religion is by pretty general consent banished from our families, that only furnishes a stronger reason why our families should not be banished from religion in the churches.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="025845_0100_0FCF2D0286EE71D0"/>
But if these opportunities are not made easy and convenient to them, their superiors have no right to expect from them a zeal so far transcending their own as to induce them to surmount difficul∣ties for the sake of their duty. Religion is never once represented in scripture as a light attainment; it is never once il∣lustrated by an easy, a quiet, or an in∣dolent allegory. On the contrary, it is exhibited under the active figure of a combat, a race; something expressive of exertion, activity, progress. And yet many are unjust enough to think that this warfare can be fought, though they are perpetually weakening the vigour of the combatant; this race be run, though they are incessantly obstructing the pro∣gress of him who runs by some hard and interfering command. That that com∣passionate judge who cannot but be par∣ticularly touched with the feeling of
<PB N="95" REF="025845_0101_0FCF2D0B82300F00"/>
<HI>their</HI> infirmities, will tenderly allow for their trials, and be merciful to their fail∣ings, can never be doubted, but what portion of that forgiveness he will ex∣tend to those who lay on their virtue hard burdens "too heavy for them to bear," who shall say?</P>
<P>To keep any immortal being in a state of spiritual darkness, is a positive disobe∣dience to <HI>His</HI> law, who when he bestow∣ed the Bible, no less than when he created the material world, said, <HI>Let there be light.</HI> It were well for both the advantage of master and servant, that the latter should have the doctrines of the Gospel frequently impressed on his heart, that his conscience should be made familiar with a system which offers such clear and intelligible propositions of mo∣ral duty. The striking interrogation, "how shall I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" will perhaps ope∣rate
<PB N="96" REF="025845_0102_0FCF2D0F39D494A8"/>
as forcibly on an uncultivated mind, as the most eloquent essay, to prove that man is not an accountable being. That once credited promise, that "they who have done well shall go into everlasting life," will be more grateful to the spirit of a plain man, than that more elegant and disinterested aphorism, that <HI>virtue is its own reward.</HI> That "he that walketh uprightly walketh surely," is not on the whole dangerous or a misleading maxim. And "well done, good and faithful servant! I will make thee ruler over many things," though offensive to the liberal spirit of philosophic dignity, is a comfortable support to humble and suf∣fering piety. That "we should do to others as we would they should do to us," is a portable and compendious mea∣sure of social duty, always at hand, as always referring to something within himself, not amiss for a poor man to carry constantly about with him, who
<PB N="97" REF="025845_0103_0FCF2D1004960AB0"/>
has neither time nor learning to search for a better. All Seneca's arguments against the fear of death, never yet re∣conciled one reader to its approach, half so effectually as the humble believer is reconciled to it by that simple persuasion, "I know that my Redeemer liveth."</P>
<P>While the modern philosopher is ex∣tending the boundaries of human know∣ledge, by undertaking to prove that mat∣ter is eternal; or enlarging the stock of human happiness, by demonstrating the extinction of spirit: it can do no harm to an unlettered man to believe, that "heaven and earth shall pass away, but God's word shall not pass away." While the former is indulging the profitable enquiry why the Deity made the world so late, or why he made it at all, it will not hurt the latter to believe that "in the beginning God made the world," and that in the end "he shall judge it
<PB N="98" REF="025845_0104_0FCF2D568C3AD430"/>
in righteousness." While the one is cri∣ticising the creed, he will be no loser by encourageing the other to keep the com∣mandments.</P>
<P>For it is a very valuable part of christianity, that though it is an entire and perfect system in its design; though it exhibits one great plan, from which complete trains of argument, and con∣nected schemes of reasoning, may be deduced; yet, in compassion to the multitude, for whom this benevolent institution was in a good measure design∣ed, and who could not have compre∣hended a long chain of propositions, or have embraced remote deductions; the most important truths of doctrine, and the most essential documents of virtue, are detailed in single maxims, and com∣prised in short sentences; independent of themselves, yet making a necessary part of a consummate whole, from a few
<PB N="99" REF="025845_0105_0FCF2D5916331EE8"/>
of which elementary principles, the whole train of human virtues has been deduced, and many a perfect body of ethics has been framed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The negligent conduct of christians, no real objection against christianity.—The rea∣son why its effects are not more manifest to worldly men, is, because believers do not lead christian lives.—Professors dif∣fer but little in their practice from un∣believers.—Even real christians are too diffident and timid, and afraid of acting up to their principles.—The absurdity of the charge commonly brought against seri∣ous people, that they are too strict.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an objection frequently brought against christianity, that if it exhibited so perfect a scheme, if its influences
<PB N="100" REF="025845_0106_0FCF2D76CBCB8800"/>
were as strong, if its effects were as powerful, as its friends pretend, it must have produced more visible consequences in the reformation of mankind. This is not the place fully to answer this objection, which, (like all the other cavils against our religion) continues to be urged just as if it never <HI>had</HI> been an∣swered</P>
<P>That vice and immorality prevail in no small degree, in countries professing christianity, we need not go out of our own to be convinced. But that this is the case only because this benign prin∣ciple is not suffered to operate in its full power, will be no less obvious to all who are sincere in their enquiries. For, if we allow (and who that examines impar∣tially can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elp allowing?) that it is the natural tendency of christianity to make men better, then it must be the aversion to receiving it, and not the faults of the
<PB N="101" REF="025845_0107_0FCF2D7848CF3FC0"/>
principle, which prevents them from be∣coming so.</P>
<P>Those who are acquainted with the effects it actually produced in the first ages of the church, when it <HI>was</HI> receiv∣ed in its genuine purity, and when it <HI>did</HI> operate without obstruction, from its <HI>followers</HI> at least, will want no other proof of its inherent power and efficacy. At that period, its most decided and in∣dustrious enemy, the emperor Julian, could recommend the <HI>manners</HI> of the Galileans to the imitation of his pagan high priest; though he himself, at the same time, was doing every thing which the most inveterate malice, sharpened by the acutest wit, and backed by the most absolute power, could devise, to discredit their doctrines.</P>
<P>Nor would the efficacy of christianity be less visible now, in influencing the conduct of its professors, if its princi∣ples
<PB N="102" REF="025845_0108_0FCF2D7A809EC488"/>
were heartily and sincerely received They would operate on the conduct so effectually, that we should see morals and manners growing out of principles, as spontaneously and necessarily as we see other consequences grow out of their proper and natural causes. Let but this great spring have its unobstructed play, and there would be little occasion to de∣claim against this excess, or that enor∣mity. If the same skill and care which are employed in curing symptoms, were vigorously levelled at the internal princi∣ple of the disease, the moral health would feel the benefit. If that attention which is bestowed in lopping the redundant and unsightly branches were devoted to the cultivation of a found and uncorrupt root, the effect of this labour would soon be discovered by the excellence of the fruits.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="025845_0109_0FCF2D7B44973390"/>
For though even in the highest possi∣ble exertion of religious principle, and the most diligent practice of all its con∣sequential train of virtues, man would still find evil propensities enough, in his fallen nature, to make it necessary that he should counteract them, by keeping alive his diligence after higher attain∣ments, and to quicken his aspirations af∣ter a better state; yet the prevailing temper would be in general right, the will would be in a great measure rectifi∣ed; and the heart, feeling and acknow∣ledging the disease, would apply itself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ligently to the only remedy. For though even the best men have infirmities enough to deplore, and feel more sen∣sibly than others, the imperfection of that vessel in which their heavenly trea∣sure is hid: these however have the in∣ternal consolation of knowing that they
<PB N="104" REF="025845_0110_0FCF2D7E44ED8150"/>
shall have to reckon with one who "knoweth whereof they are made;" who will accept of faith and repentance instead of sinless perfection, and of humble sincerity in lieu of entire holi∣ness.</P>
<P>All the heavy charges which have been brought against religion, have been taken from the abuses of it. In every other instance the injustice of this pro∣ceeding would be notorious: but there is a general want of candour in the judgment of men on this subject, which we do not find them exercise on other occasions; that of throwing the fault of the erring or ignorant professor on the profession itself.</P>
<P>It does not derogate from the honour∣able profession of arms, that there are cowards and braggarts. If any man lose his estate by the chicanery of an attorney,
<PB N="105" REF="025845_0111_0FCF2D7FC4A53968"/>
or his health by the blunder of a phy∣sician, it is commonly said, that the one was a disgrace to his business, and the other was ignorant of it; but no one therefore concludes that law and physic are contemptible professions.</P>
<P>Christianity alone is obliged to bear all the obloquy incurred by the miscon∣duct of its followers; to sustain all the reproach excited by ignorant, by fana∣tical, by superstitious, or hypocritical professors. But whoever accuses it of a tendency to produce the errors of these professors, must have picked up his opi∣nion any where rather than in the New Testament, which being the only au∣thentic history of christianity, is that which candour would naturally consult for information.</P>
<P>But as worldly and irreligious men do not draw their notions from that pure fountain, but from the polluted stream
<PB N="106" REF="025845_0112_0FCF2D846DA0F050"/>
of human practice; as they form their judgment of divine truth from the con∣duct of those who pretend to be en∣lightened by it; some charitable allow∣ance <HI>must</HI> be made for the contempt which they entertain for christianity, when they see what poor effects it pro∣duces in the lives of the generality of professing christians. What do they observe there which can lead them to entertain very high ideas of the princi∣ples which give birth to such practices?</P>
<P>Do men of the world discover any marked, any decided difference between the conduct of nominal christians, and that of the rest of their neighbours who pretend to no religion at all? Do they see, in the daily lives of such, any great abundance of those fruits by which they have heard believers are to be known? On the contrary, do they not discern in them the same anxious and unwearied
<PB N="107" REF="025845_0113_0FCF2D86AD61EB80"/>
pursuit after the things of the earth, as in those who do not profess to have any thought of heaven? Do not they seem then to labour as sedulously in the inter∣ests of a debasing and frivolous dissipati∣on, as those who do not pretend to have any nobler object in view? Is there not the same eagerness to plunge into all sorts of follies themselves, and the same unrighteous speed in introducing their children to them, as if they had never entered into a solemn engagement to renounce them? Is there not the same self-indulgence, the same luxury, and the same passionate attachment to the things of this world in them, as is visi∣ble in those who do not look for another.</P>
<P>Do not thoughtless neglect, and ha∣bitual dissipation, answer, as to society, all the ends of the most decided infidelity? Between the barely decent, and the openly profane, there is indeed this
<PB N="108" REF="025845_0114_0FCF2D883A9880E8"/>
difference; that the one, by making no profession, deceives neither the world, nor his own heart; while the other, by intrenching himself in forms, fancies that he does something, and thanks God that "he is not like the publican." The one only shuts his eyes upon the danger which the other despises.</P>
<P>But these unfruitful professors would do well to recollect, that, by a conduct so little worthy of their high calling, they not only violate the law to which they have vowed obedience, but occasi∣on many to disbelieve or to despise it; that they are thus in a great measure accountable for the infidelity of others, and of course will have to answer for more than their own personal offences. For did they in any respect live up to the principles they profess; did they adorn the doctrines of christianity by a life in any degree consonant to their faith; did
<PB N="109" REF="025845_0115_0FCF2D8989B4A650"/>
they exhibit any thing of the <Q>beauty of holiness</Q> in their daily conversation; they would then give such a demonstra∣tive proof, not only of the sincerity of their own obedience, but of the bright∣ness of that divine light by which they profess to walk, that the most deter∣mined unbeliever would at last begin to think there must be <HI>something</HI> in a religion of which the effects were so vi∣sible, and the fruits so amiable; and might in time be led to "glorify," not <HI>them,</HI> not the imperfect doers of these works, but "their Father which is in heaven." Whereas, as things are at present carried on, the obvious conclu∣sion must be, either that christians do not believe in the religion they profess, or that there is not truth in the religion itself.</P>
<P>For will he not naturally say, that, if its influences were so predominant,
<PB N="110" REF="025845_0116_0FCF2D8C6810C660"/>
its consequences must be more evident? that, if the prize held out were really so bright, those who truly believed so would surely <HI>do</HI> something, and <HI>sacrifice</HI> some∣thing, to obtain it?</P>
<P>This swells the amount of the actual mischief beyond calculation. And there is something terrible in the idea of this sort of indefinite evil, that the careless christian can never know the extent of the contagion he spreads, nor the mul∣tiplied infection which <HI>they</HI> may com∣municate in <HI>their</HI> turn, whom <HI>his</HI> disor∣ders first corrupted.</P>
<P>And there is this farther aggravation of his offence, that he will not only be answerable for the positive evil of which his example is the cause; but for the o∣mission of all the probable good which might have been called forth in others, had <HI>his</HI> actions been consistent with his
<PB N="111" REF="025845_0117_0FCF2D8D6942AEE0"/>
profession. What a strong, what an al∣most irresistible conviction would it car∣ry to the hearts of unbelievers, if they beheld that characteristic difference in the manners of christians, which their profession gives one a right to expect! if they saw that disinterestedness, that humility, sober-mindedness, temper∣ance, simplicity, and sincerity, which are the unavoidable fruits of a genuine faith.</P>
<P>But, while a man talks like a saint, and yet lives like a sinner; while he pro∣fesses to believe like an apostle, and yet leads the life of a sensualist; talks of an ardent faith, and yet exhibits a cold and low practice: boasts himself the disci∣ple of a meek master, and yet is as much a slave to his passions as they who ac∣knowledge no such authority; while he appears the proud professor of an humble religion, or the intemperate champion of
<PB N="112" REF="025845_0118_0FCF2D8ECC01BEE8"/>
a self-denying one: such a man brings christianity into disrepute; confirms those in error who might have been a∣wakened to conviction; strengthens doubt into disbelief; and hardens in∣difference into contempt.</P>
<P>Even among those of a better cast, and a purer principle, the excessive restraints of timidity, caution, and that "fear of man, which bringeth a snare" confine, and almost stifle the generous spirit of an ardent exertion in the cause of religion. Christanity may pathe∣tically expostulate, that it is not always "an open enemy which dishonours her," but her "familiar friend." And "what dost thou more than others?" is a question which even the good and worthy should often ask themselves, in order to quicken their Zeal? to prevent the total stagnation of unexerted principles, on the one hand; or the danger, on the
<PB N="113" REF="025845_0119_0FCF2D90CFAA8368"/>
other, of their being driven down the gulf of ruin, by the unresisted and confluent tides of temptation, fashion, and example.</P>
<P>In a very strict and mortified age, of which a scrupulous severity was the pre∣dominant character, precautions against an excessive zeal might and doubtless would, be a wholesome and prudent measure. But in these times of relaxed principle and frigid indifference, to see people so vigilantly on their guard against the imaginary mischiefs of enthusiasm, while they run headlong into the real perils of a destructive licentiousness, puts one in mind of the one-eyed animal in the fable; who, living on the banks of the ocean, never fancied he could be destroyed any way but by drowning: but while he kept that one eye constantly fixed on the sea, on which side he con∣cluded all the peril lay, he was devour∣ed
<PB N="114" REF="025845_0120_0FCF2D94020691E8"/>
by an enemy on the dry land, from which quarter he never suspected any danger.</P>
<P>Are not the mischiefs of an enthusia∣stic piety insisted on, with as much earnest∣ness as if an extravagant devotion were the prevailing propensity? Is not the ne∣cessity of moderation as vehemently urged, as if an intemperate zeal were the epide∣mic distemper of the great world? as if all our apparent danger and natural bias lay on the side of a too rigid auste∣rity, which required the discreet and constant counteraction of an opposite principle? Would not a stranger be almost tempted to imagine, from the frequent invectives against extreme strictness, that abstraction from the world, and a monastic rage for retreat, were the ruling temper; that we were in some danger in seeing our places of diversion abandoned; and the enthusia∣stic
<PB N="115" REF="025845_0121_0FCF2D9584B54AB0"/>
scenes of the <HI>Holy Fathers of the de∣sert</HI> acted over again by the frantic and uncontroulable devotion of our young persons of fashion?</P>
<P>It is seriously to be regretted, in an age like the present, remarkable for in∣difference in religion and levity in man∣ners, and which stands so much in need of lively patterns of firm and resolute piety, that many who really are christi∣ans on the soberest conviction, should not appear more openly and decidedly on the side they have espoused; that they assi∣milate so very much with the manners of those about them (which manners they yet scruple not to disapprove); and, instead of an avowed but prudent sted∣fastness, which might draw over the others, appear evidently fearful of being thought precise and over-scrupulous; and actually seem to disavow their right principles, by concessions and accommo∣dations
<PB N="116" REF="025845_0122_0FCF2D9768C5A710"/>
not strictly consistent with them. They often seem cautiously afraid of <HI>doing too much,</HI> and <HI>going too far:</HI> and the dan∣gerous plea, the necessity of <HI>living like other people,</HI> of <HI>being like the rest of the world,</HI> and the propriety of <HI>not being par∣ticular,</HI> is brought as a reasonable apolo∣gy for a too yielding and indiscriminate conformity.</P>
<P>But, at a time when almost all are sink∣ing into the prevailing corruption, how beautiful a rare, a single integrity is, let the instances of Lot and Noah declare. And to those with whom a poem is an higher authority than the Bible, let me recommend the most animated picture of a righteous singularity that ever was delineated, in
<Q><L>—The Seraph Abdiel, faithful found</L>
<L>Among the faithless, faithful only he;</L>
<L>Among innumerable false, unmov'd,</L>

To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind.</L>
<L>Tho' SINGLE.</L>
<BIBL>Par. Lost, b. iv.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Few indeed of the more orderly and decent have any objection to that degree of religion which is compatible with their general acceptance with others, or the full enjoyment of their own pleasures. For a formal and ceremonious exercise of the outward duties of christianity may not only be kept up without exciting censure, but will even procure a certain respect and confidence; and is not quite irreconcileable with a voluptuous and dissipated life. So far many go; and so far "as godliness is profitable to the life that <HI>is,"</HI> it passes without reproach.</P>
<P>But as soon as men begin to consider religious exercises not as a decency, but a duty; not as a commutation for a self-denying life, but as a means to promote a holy temper, and a virtuous conduct:
<PB N="118" REF="025845_0124_0FCF2D9A463E7320"/>
as soon as they feel disposed to carry the effect of their devotion into their daily life: as soon as their principles discover themselves, by leading them to withdraw from those scenes, and abstain from those actions, in which the gay place their su∣preme happiness: as soon as something is to be <HI>done,</HI> and something is to be <HI>part∣ed with;</HI> then the world begins to take offence, and to stigmatize the <HI>activity</HI> of that piety, which had been commended as long as it remained <HI>inoperative,</HI> and had only evaporated in <HI>words.</HI></P>
<P>But when religion, like the vital prin∣ciple, takes its seat in the heart, and sends out supplies of life and heat to every part; diffuses motion, soul, and vigour, through the whole circulation; and informs and animates the whole man: when it operates on the practice, influences the conversation, breaks out into a lively zeal for the honour of God,
<PB N="119" REF="025845_0125_0FCF2D9CB544F298"/>
and the best interests of mankind; then the sincerity, or the understanding, of that person will become questionable: and it must be owing to a very fortunate combination of circumstances indeed, if he can at once preserve the character of parts and piety.</P>
<P>But it is a folly to talk of being too holy, too strict, or too good. Where there happens to appear some foundation for the charge of enthusiasm (as there are indeed too often in good people ec∣centricities which justify the censure), we may depend upon it, that it proceeds from some defect in the judgment, and not from any excess in the piety; for in goodness there is no excess: and it is as preposterous to say that any one is too good, or too pious, as that he is too wise, too strong, or too healthy; since the highest point in all these is only the per∣fection of that quality which we admired
<PB N="120" REF="025845_0126_0FCF2D9DC55D5250"/>
in a lower degree. There may be an <HI>imprudent,</HI> but there cannot be a <HI>supera∣bundant</HI> goodness. An ardent imagina∣tion may mislead a rightly turned heart; and a weak intellect may incline the best intentioned to ascribe too much value to things of comparatively small impor∣tance. Such an one not having discern∣ment enough to perceive where the force and stress of duty lie, may innocently discredit religion by a too scrupulous ex∣actness in points of small intrinsic value.</P>
<P>And even well-meaning men, as well as hypocrites, may think too much is done when their "mint" and "anise" are rigorously tithed.</P>
<P>But in observing the "weightier mat∣ters of the law," in the practice of univer∣sal holiness, in the love of God, there can be no possibility of exceeding, while there is no limitation in the command.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="025845_0127_0FCF2DA2332E1CA0"/>
We are in no danger of loving our neigh∣bour <HI>better</HI> than ourselves; and let us re∣member, that we do not go beyond, but fall short of our duty, while we love him <HI>less.</HI> If we were commanded to love God with <HI>some</HI> of our heart, with <HI>part</HI> of our soul, and a <HI>portion</HI> of our strength, there would then be some colour for those perpetual cavils about the <HI>propor∣tion</HI> of love, and the <HI>degree</HI> of obedience, which are due to him. But as the com∣mand is so definite, so absolute, so com∣prehensive, so entire; nothing can be more absurd than that unmeaning, but not unfrequent charge brought against serious persons, that <HI>they are too strict.</HI></P>
<P>The foundation of this silly censure is commonly laid in the first principles of education, where an early separation is systematically made between duty and pleasure. One of the first baits held out for the encouragement of children, is,
<PB N="122" REF="025845_0128_0FCF2DA3E80623B8"/>
that when they have done their <HI>duty,</HI> they will be entitled to some <HI>pleasure;</HI> thus for∣cibly disjoining what should be consider∣ed as inseparable. And there is not a more common justification of that idle and dissipated manner in which the se∣cond half of the Sunday is commonly spent, even by those who make a con∣science, of spending the former part prop∣erly, than that, "now they have done their duty, they may take their pleasure."</P>
<P>But while christian observances are considered as tasks, which are to be got over to entitle us to something more plea∣sant; as a burthen which we must en∣dure in order to propitiate an inexorable Judge, who makes a hard bargain with his creatures, and allows them just so much amusement in pay for so much drudgery; we must not wonder that such low views are entertained of christianity, and that a religious life is reprobated as strict and rigid.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="025845_0129_0FCF2DA589A55C40"/>
But to him who acts from the nobler motive of love, and the animating power of the christian hope, the exercise is the reward, the permission is the privilege, the work is the wages. <HI>He</HI> does not carve out some miserable pleasure, and stipulate for some meagre diversion, to pay himself for the hard performance of his duty, who in that very performance, experiences the highest pleasure, and feels the truest gratification of which his nature is capable.</P>
<P>This reprobated strictness therefore, so far from being the source of discom∣fort and misery, as is pretended, is in re∣ality the true cause of actual enjoyment, by laying the axe to the root of all those turbulent and uneasy passions, the unre∣served and yet imperfect gratification of which does so much more tend to disturb
<PB N="124" REF="025845_0130_0FCF422F4AB397F0"/>
our happiness than that self-government christianity enjoins.</P>
<P>But all precepts seem rigorous, all ob∣servances are really hard, where there is not an entire conviction of God's right to our obedience, and an internal princi∣ple of faith and love to make that obedi∣ence pleasant. A religious life is indeed a hard bondage to one immersed in the practices of the world, the flesh, and the fashion. To a perfect christian, it is "perfect freedom." He does not now abstain from such and such things, mere∣ly because they are forbidden (as he did in the first stages of his progress), but because his soul has no longer any plea∣sure in them. And it would be the seve∣rest of all punishments to oblige him to return to those practices, from which he once abstained with difficulty, and through the less noble principle of fear.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="025845_0131_0FCF4230548A8B80"/>
There is not therefore perhaps a greater mistake than that common noti∣on entertained by the more orderly part of the fashionable world, that a little religion will make people happy, but that an high degree of it is incompati∣ble with all enjoyment. For surely <HI>that</HI> religion can add little to a man's happi∣ness which restrains him from the com∣mission of a wrong action, but which does not pretend to extinguish the bad principle from which the act proceeded. A religion which ties the hands, without changing the heart; which, like the hell of Tantalus, subdues not the desire, yet forbids the gratification, is indeed an uncomfortable state. Such a religion, though it may gain a man something on the side of reputation, will give him but little inward comfort, if his heart be still left a prey to that temper which produc∣ed the evil, even though terror or shame may have prevented the outward act.</P>

That people devoted to the pursuits of a dissipated life should conceive of religion as a difficult and even unattain∣able state, it is easy to believe. That they should conceive of it as an unhappy state, is the consummation of their error and their ignorance: for that a <HI>rational</HI> being should have his understanding en∣lightened; that an <HI>immortal</HI> being should have his views extended and enlarged; that a <HI>helpless</HI> being should have a con∣sciousness of assistance; a <HI>sinful</HI> being the prospect of pardon; or a <HI>fallen</HI> one the assurance of restoration, does not seem a probable ground of unhappiness; and on any other subject such reasoning would not be admissible.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A stranger, from observing the fashionable mode of life, would not take this to be a christian country.—Lives of professing christians examined by a comparison with the Gospel.—Christianity not made the rule of life, even by those who profess to receive it as an object of faith.—Temporizing divines contribute to lower the credit of Christiani∣ty.—Loose harangues on morals not calcu∣lated to reform the heart.</HEAD>
<P>THE christian religion is not intended as some of its fashionable professors seem to fancy, to operate as a charm, a talis∣man, or incantation; and to produce its effect by our pronouncing certain my∣stical words, attending at certain conse∣crated places, and performing certain hallowed ceremonies: but it is an active, vital, influential principle, operating on
<PB N="128" REF="025845_0134_0FCF423B351DCB28"/>
the heart, restraining the desires, affect∣ing the general conduct, and as much regulating our commerce with the world, our business, pleasures, and en∣joyments, our conversations, designs and actions, as our behaviour in public worship, or even in private devotion.</P>
<P>That the effects of such a principle are strikingly visible in the lives and manners of the generality of those who give the law to fashion, will not perhaps be insisted on. And indeed, the whole present system of fashionable life is utterly destructive of seriousness. To instance only in one particular amuse∣ment, which is generally thought insig∣nificant, and is in effect so vapid, that one almost wonders how it can be dan∣gerous: it would excite laughter, be∣cause we are so broken into the habit, were I to insist on the immorality of
<PB N="129" REF="025845_0135_0FCF423D39BCE628"/>
passing one's whole life in a crowd. But those promiscuous myriads which com∣pose the society, falsely so called, of the gay world; who are brought together without esteem, remain without pleasure, and part without regret; who live in a round of diversions, the possession of which is so joyless, though the absence is so insupportable, these, by the mere force of incessant and indiscriminate as∣sociation, weaken, and in time wear out the best feelings and affections of the human heart. And the mere spirit of dissipation, thus contracted from inva∣riable habit, even detached from all its concomitant evils, is in itself as hostile to a religious spirit, as more positive and actual offences. Far be it from me to say that it is as criminal; I only insist that it is as opposite to that heavenly mindedness which is the offence of the christian temper.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="025845_0136_0FCF423F57FC4DF8"/>
We know that in the mingled mass which celebrate the orgies of dissipation, are many amiable and well-inclined hearts, whom nothing but the tyranny of fashion could have driven thither. But let us suppose an ignorant and unpreju∣diced spectator, who should have been taught the theory of all the religions on the globe, brought hither from the other hemisphere. Set him down in the po∣litest part of our capital, and let him determine, if he can, except from what he shall see interwoven in the texture of our laws, and kept up in the service of our churches, to what particular religi∣on we belong. Let him not mix en∣tirely with the most flagitious, but only with the most fashionable; at least, let him keep what they themselves call <HI>the best company.</HI> Let him scrutinize into the manners, customs, conversations, ha∣bits, and diversions, most in vogue, and
<PB N="131" REF="025845_0137_0FCF4240D6D43918"/>
then infer what is the established religi∣on of the land.</P>
<P>That it could not be the Jewish, he would soon discover; for of rites, cere∣monies, and external observances, he would trace but slender remains. He would be equally convinced that it could not be the religion of old Greece and Rome; for that enjoined reverence to the Gods, and inculcated obedience to the laws. His most probable conclusi∣on would be in favour of the Mahome∣tan faith, did not the excessive indulgence of some of the most distinguished, in an article of intemperance prohibited even by the sensual Prophet of Arabia, de∣feat that conjecture.</P>
<P>How would the petrified enquirer be astonished, if he were told that all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se were of a religion meek, spiritual; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>-denying; of which poverty of spirit, a
<PB N="132" REF="025845_0138_0FCF4243A6501330"/>
renewed mind, and non-conformity to the world, were specific distinctions!</P>
<P>When he saw the sons of men of for∣tune, scarcely old enough to be sent to school, admitted to be spectators of the turbulent and unnatural diversions of racing and gaming; and the almost in∣fant daughters, even of wise and virtu∣ous mothers (an innovation which fashi∣on herself forbad till now), carried with most unthrifty anticipation to the fre∣quent and late-protracted ball; would he believe that we were of a religion which has required from these very pa∣rents, a solemn vow that these children should be bred up "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?"</P>
<P>When he beheld those nocturnal clubs, so subversive of private virtue and do∣mestic happiness, would he conceive that we were of a religion which in ex∣press
<PB N="133" REF="025845_0139_0FCF4245664B8720"/>
terms "exhorts young men to be sober-minded?"</P>
<P>When he saw those magnificent and brightly illuminated structures which decorate and disgrace the very precincts of the royal residence (so free itself from all these pollutions;) when he beheld the nightly offerings made to the demon of play, on whose cruel altar the fortune and happiness of wives and children are offered up without remorse; would he not conclude that we were of some of those barbarous religions which enjoin unnatural sacrifices, and whose horrid deities are appeased with nothing less than human victims? If any thing could add to his astonishment, it must be to observe, in some more private temples of this demon, that the fair sacrifice is often a voluntary one, self-offered, and at once both priestess and victim.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="025845_0140_0FCF424700905920"/>
Now, ought we not to pardon our imaginary spectator, if he should not at once conclude that all the various de∣scriptions of persons, above noticed, professed the christian religion; suppo∣sing him to have no other way of deter∣mining but by the conformity of their manners to that rule by which he had undertaken to judge them? We indeed ourselves must judge with greater lati∣tude, and candidly take the present state of society into the account; which, in some few instances perhaps, must be allowed to dispense with that literal strictness, which more peculiarly be∣longed to the first ages of the Gospel.</P>
<P>But as this is really a christian country, professing to enjoy the purest faith in the purest form; it cannot be unreasonable to go a little farther, and enquire wheth∣er christianity, however firmly establish∣ed, and generally professed in it, is really
<PB N="135" REF="025845_0141_0FCF424955797B78"/>
practised by that order of fashionable per∣sons, who, while they are absorbed in the delights of the world, and their whole souls devoted to the pursuit of pleasure, yet still arrogate to themselves the honourable name of christians and occasionally testify their claim to this high character, by a general profession of their belief in, and a decent compli∣ance with, the forms of religion.</P>
<P>This enquiry must be made, not by a comparison with the state of christiani∣ty in other countries (a mode always fallacious, whether adopted by nations or individuals, is that of comparing them∣selves with those who are still worse); nor must it be made from any notions drawn from custom, decency, or any other human standard; but from a scrip∣ture view of what real religion is; from any one of those striking and compre∣hensive representations of it, which may
<PB N="136" REF="025845_0142_0FCF4253081C2818"/>
be found condensed in so many single passages of the sacred writings.</P>
<P>Whoever then looks into the Book of God, and observes its prevailing spirit, and then looks into that part of the world under consideration, will not surely be thought very censorious, if he pronounce that the conformity between them does not seem to be <HI>very</HI> striking; and that the one does not very evidently appear to be dictated by the other. Will he discover that the christian religion is so much as pretended to be made the <HI>rule of life,</HI> even by that decent order who profess not to have discarded it as an object of faith? Do even the more regular, who neglect not public observances, consider christianity as <HI>the measure of their actions?</HI> Do even what the <HI>world</HI> calls religious persons employ their time, their abilities, and their fortune, as talents for which they however confess they believe them∣selves
<PB N="137" REF="025845_0143_0FCF4254ECC8FB28"/>
accountable: or do they in any respect live, I will not say up to their profession (for what human being does so?), but in any consistency with it, or even with an eye to its predominant ten∣dencies? Do persons in general of this description seem to consider the peculiar doctrines of the Gospel as any thing more than a form of words, necessary in∣deed to be repeated, and proper to be believed? But do they consider them as necessary to be adopted into a governing principle of action?</P>
<P>Is it consistent to declare in the solemn assemblies that they are "miserable of∣fenders," and that "there is no health in them," and never in their daily lives to discover any symptom of that humility which should naturally be implied in such a declaration?</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="025845_0144_0FCF4255DC67A6F8"/>
Is it reasonable, or consistent with good sense, earnestly to lament having "followed the desires of their own hearts," and then deliberately to plunge into such a torrent of dissipations as clear∣ly indicates that they do not struggle to resist <HI>one</HI> of them? I dare not say this is hypocrisy, but surely it is inconsistency.</P>
<P>"Be ye not conformed to this world," is a leading principle in the book they acknowledge as their guide. But after unresistingly assenting to this, as a doctri∣nal truth, at church; how absurd would they think any one who should expect them to adopt it into their practice! Per∣haps the whole law of God does not ex∣hibit a single precept more expressly, more steadily, and more uniformly re∣jected. If it mean any thing, it can hardly be consistent with that mode of life emphatically distinguished by the appellation of <HI>fashionable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="025845_0145_0FCF42579B7E8B30"/>
Now would it be much more absurd (for any other reason but because it is not the custom) if our legislators were to meet one day in every week, gravely to read over all the obsolete statutes, and rescinded acts of parliament; than it is for the order of persons of the above description to assemble every Sunday, to profess their belief in, and submission to, a system of principles, which they do not so much as <HI>intend</HI> shall be binding on their practice?</P>
<P>But to continue our enquiry.—There is not a more common or more intelli∣gible definition of human duty, than that of "Fear God, and keep his command∣ments." Now, as to the first of these in∣separable precepts, can we, with the utmost stretch of charity, be very for∣ward to conclude that God is really "very greatly feared," in secret, by those who give too manifest indications that
<PB N="140" REF="025845_0146_0FCF425C4C8C6ED0"/>
they live "without him in the world?" And as to the latter precept, which na∣turally grows out of the other—without noticing any of the flagrant breaches of the moral law, let us only confine our∣selves to the allowed, general, and no∣torious violation of the fourth com∣mandment, and then enquire what apo∣logy can be offered for this, by believers at least, who scruple not to allow the authority of that book, which declares, among many other alarming denuncia∣tions, that the wilful and habitual offend∣er in any one point is guilty of the breach of the whole law.</P>
<P>Shall we have reason to change our opinion, if we take another divine re∣presentation of the sum and substance of religion, and apply it as a touchstone in the present trial—"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thyself?"
<PB N="141" REF="025845_0147_0FCF425E8E917248"/>
Now, judging by inference, do we see many public proofs of that heavenly-mindedness which would be the inevita∣ble effect of such a fervent and animated dedication of all the powers, faculties, and affections of the soul to him who gave it? And, as to the great rule of social duty expressed in the second clause, do we observe very much of that consi∣derate kindness, that pure disinterested∣ness, that conscientious attention to the comfort of others, especially of depend∣ants and inferiors, which might be ex∣pected from those who enjoy the privi∣lege of so unerring a standard of con∣duct? a standard which, if impartially consulted, must make our kindness to others bear an exact proportion to our self-love: a rule in which christian prin∣ciple, operating on human sensibility, could not fail to decide aright in every supposable case. For no man can doubt how he ought to act, towards another,
<PB N="142" REF="025845_0148_0FCF63EAF619BB40"/>
while the corresponding suggestions of conscience and feeling concur in letting him know how he would wish, in a change of circumstances, that others should act towards him.</P>
<P>Or suppose we take a more detailed survey, by a third rule, which indeed is not so much the principle as the effect of piety—"True religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself <HI>unspotted from the world."</HI> Now if christianity in∣sists that obedience to the latter in∣junction be the true evidence of the sin∣cerity of those who fulfil the former, is the beneficence of the fashionable world <HI>very</HI> strikingly illustrated by this spotless purity, this exemption from the pollutions of the world, which is here declared to be its infallible symptom?</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="025845_0149_0FCF63EC806B3550"/>
But if I were to venture to take my estimate with a view more immediately evangelical; if I presumed to look for that genuine christianity which consists in "repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ," to insist that, whatever <HI>natural</HI> religion and <HI>fashionable</HI> religion may teach, it is the peculiarity of the <HI>christian</HI> religion to humble the sinner and exalt the Saviour; to insist that not only the grossly flagitious, but that <HI>all,</HI> have sinned; that <HI>all</HI> are by nature in a state of condemnation; that <HI>all</HI> stand in need of mercy, of which there is no hope but on the Gospel terms; that eter∣nal life is promised to those <HI>only</HI> who accept it on the offered conditions of "faith, repentance, and renewed obedi∣ence;"—if I were to insist on such evi∣dences of our christianity as these; if I were to express these doctrines in plain scriptural terms, without lowering, qua∣lifying, disguising, or doing them away;
<PB N="144" REF="025845_0150_0FCF63EE6A15B650"/>
if I were to insist on this belief, and its implied and corresponding practices; I am aware that, with whatever condes∣cending patience this little tract might have been so far perused, many a fashion∣able reader would here throw it aside, as having now detected the palpable enthu∣siast, the abettor of "strange doctrines," long ago consigned over by the liberal and the polite to bigots and fanatics. And yet, if the Bible be true, this is a simple and faithful description of chris∣tianity.</P>
<P>After having, however, just ventur∣ed to hint that such are indeed the humbling doctrines of the Gospel, to which alone eternal life is promised; I shall, in deep humility, forbear enlarging on this part of the subject, which has been exhausted by the labours of wise and pious men in all ages. Unhappily, however, the most awakening of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se
<PB N="145" REF="025845_0151_0FCF63EF8CF7F628"/>
writers are not the favourite guests in the closets of the more fashionable christians; who, when they happen to be more seriously disposed than ordina∣ry, are fond of finding out some middle kind of reading, which recommends some half-way state, something between paganism and christianity, suspending the mind, like the position of Mahomet's tomb, between earth and heaven: a kind of reading which, while it quiets the conscience by being on the side of mo∣rals, neither awakens their fears, nor alarms their security. By dealing in general, it comes home to the hearts of none: it flatters the passions of the read∣er, by ascribing high merit to the per∣formance of certain right actions, and the forbearance from certain wrong ones; among which, that reader must be very unlucky indeed who does not find some performances and some for∣bearances of his own. It at once ena∣bles
<PB N="146" REF="025845_0152_0FCF63F166ABA0B0"/>
him to keep heaven in his eye, and the world in his heart. It agreeably re∣presents the readers to themselves as amiable persons; guilty indeed of a few faults, but never as condemned sinners under sentence of death. It commonly abounds with high encomiums on the dignity of human nature; the good ef∣fects of virtue on health, fortune, and reputation; the dangers of a blind zeal, the mischiefs of enthusiasm, and the folly of being "righteous over much;" with various other kindred sentiments, which, if they do not fall in of them∣selves with the corruptions of our na∣ture, may, by a little warping, be easily accommodated to them.</P>
<P>These are the too successful practices of lukewarm and temporizing divines, who have become popular by blunting the edge of that heavenly tempered wea∣pon, whose salutary keenness, but for
<PB N="147" REF="025845_0153_0FCF63F29E5332E8"/>
their "deceitful handling," would often∣er "pierce to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit."</P>
<P>But those severer preachers of righte∣ousness, who disgust by applying too closely to the conscience; who probe the inmost heart, and lay open all its latent peccancies; who treat of principles as the only certain source of manners; who lay the axe to the root, oftener than the pruning knife to the branch; who insist much and often on the great leading truthe, that man is a fallen creature, who must be restored, if he be restored at all, by means very little flattering to human pride—such as these will seldom find access to the houses and hearts of the more modish christians; unless they happen to owe their admission to some subordinate quality of style; unless they can captivate, with the seducing graces of language, those well-bred readers,
<PB N="148" REF="025845_0154_0FCF63F3F7DA1880"/>
who are childishly amusing themselves with the garnish, when they are perish∣ing for want of food; who are searching for polished periods, when they should be in quest of alarming truths; who are looking for elegance of composition, when they should be anxious for eternal life.</P>
<P>Whatever comparative praise may be due to the former class of writers, when viewed with others of a less decent order yet I am not sure whether so many books of frigid morality, exhibiting such inferior motives of action, and such mo∣derate representations of duty, have not done religion much more harm than good; whether they do not lead many a reader to enquire what is the lowest degree in the scale of virtue with which he may content himself, so as barely to escape eternal punishment; how much indulgence he may allow himself, with∣out
<PB N="149" REF="025845_0155_0FCF63F5775E31C0"/>
absolutely forfeiting his chance of safety; what is the uttermost verge to which he may venture of this world's enjoyment, and yet just keep within a possibility of hope for the next: adjusting the scales of indulgence and security with such a scrupulous equilibrium, as not to lose much pleasure, yet not incur much penalty.</P>
<P>This is hardly an exaggerated repre∣sentation: and to these low views of du∣ty is partly owing so much of that bare-weight virtue with which even christians are so apt to content themselves: fight∣ing for every inch of ground which may possibly be taken within the pales of permission; and stretching those pales to the utmost edge of that limitation about which the world and the Bible contend.</P>
<P>But while the nominal christian is persuading himself that there can be no
<PB N="150" REF="025845_0156_0FCF63F6F80E99E8"/>
harm in going <HI>a little farther,</HI> the real christian is always afraid of going too far. While the one is debating for a lit∣tle more disputed ground, the other is so fearful of straying into the regions of unallowed indulgence, that he keeps at a prudent distance from the extremity of his permitted limits, and is as anxious in restricting as the other is in extend∣ing them. One thing is clear, and it may be no bad indication by which to discover the state of a man's heart to himself: while he is contending for this allowance, and stipulating for the other indulgence, it will shew him that, whatever change there may be in his life, there is none in his heart; the temper remains as it did; and it is by the inward frame rather than the out∣ward act that he can best judge of his <HI>own</HI> state, whatever may be the rule by which he undertakes to judge of that of another.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="025845_0157_0FCF63F9377E67D8"/>
It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wonderful that there are not more christians, than that christians, as they are called, are not better men: for if christianity be not true, the motives to virtue are not high enough to quicken ordinary men to very extraordinary ex∣ertions. We see them do and suffer every day, for popularity, for custom, for fashion, for the point of honour, not only more than good men do and suffer for religion, but a great deal more than religion requires them to do. For her <HI>reasonable service</HI> demands no sacrifices but what are sanctified by good sense, sound policy, right reason, and uncor∣rupt judgment.</P>
<P>Many of these fashionable professors even go so far as to bring their right faith as an apology for their wrong prac∣tice. They have a commodious way of intrenching themselves within the shelter of some general position of unquestiona∣ble
<PB N="152" REF="025845_0158_0FCF63FAC0ED3A78"/>
truth. Even the great christian hope, becomes a snare to them. They apolo∣gize for a life of offence, by taking refuge in the supreme goodness they are abusing. That "God is all merciful," is the com∣mon reply to those who hint to them their danger. This is a false and fatal appli∣cation of a divine and comfortable truth. Nothing can be more certain than the proposition, nor more delusive than the inference: for their deduction implies, not that he is merciful to sin repented of, but to sin continued in. But it is a most fallacious hope to expect that God will violate his own covenant, or that he is indeed "all mercy," to the utter exclu∣sion of his other attributes of perfect ho∣liness, purity, and justice.</P>
<P>It is a dangerous folly to rest on these vague and general notions of uncovenant∣ed mercy; and nothing can be more de∣lusive than this indefinite trust in being
<PB N="153" REF="025845_0159_0FCF63FC36BED8C8"/>
forgiven in our <HI>own</HI> way, after God has clearly revealed to us that he will only for∣give us in <HI>his</HI> way.</P>
<P>But the truth is, no one does truly trust in God, who does not endeavour to obey him. For to break his laws, and yet to depend on his favour; to live in opposition to his will, and yet in expecta∣tion of his mercy; to violate his com∣mands, and yet look for his acceptance, would not, in any other instance, be thought a reasonable ground of conduct; and yet it is by no means as uncommon as it is inconsistent.</P>
<P>But the life of a dissipated christian seems to be a perpetual struggle to recon∣cile impossibilities: it is an endeavour to unite what God has for ever separated, peace and sin; unchristian practices with christian observances; a quiet conscience and a disorderly life; a heart full of this
<PB N="154" REF="025845_0160_0FCF63FDB86587D0"/>
world, and an unfounded dependance on the happiness of the next.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>View of those who acknowledge christianity as a perfect system of morals, but deny its divine authority—Morality not the whole of religion.</HEAD>
<P>AS in the preceding chapter notice was taken of that description of persons who profess to receive christianity with great reverence as a matter of faith, who yet do not pretend to adopt it as a rule of conduct; I shall conclude these slight re∣marks with some short animadversions on another set of men, and that not a smallone, among the decent and the fashionable, who profess to think it exhibits an admi∣rable system of morals, while they deny
<PB N="155" REF="025845_0161_0FCF2CFFD81B5B30"/>
its divine authority; though that alone can make the necessity of obeying its pre∣cepts binding on the consciences of men.</P>
<P>This is a very discreet scheme: for such persons at once save themselves from the discredit of having their under∣standing imposed upon by a supposed blind submission to evidences and autho∣rities; and yet, prudently enough, secure to themselves, in no small degree, the re∣putation of good men. By steering this middle kind of course, they contrive to be reckoned liberal by the <HI>philosophers,</HI> and decent by the believers.</P>
<P>But we are not commonly to expect to see the pure morality of the Gospel very carefully transfused into the lives of such objectors. And indeed it would be unjust to imagine that the precepts <HI>should</HI> be most scrupulously observed by those who reject the authority. The
<PB N="156" REF="025845_0162_0FCF6402A7147888"/>
influence of divine truth, must necessari∣ly best prepare the heart for an unreserv∣ed obedience to its laws. If we do not depend on that pardon and acceptance which christianity offers, we shall want the best motive to the actions and per∣formances which it enjoins. A lively belief <HI>must</HI> therefore precede a very hearty and complete obedience. We are told, on the very best authority, that truth sanctifies the heart: and the same autho∣rity adds, that, the "word of God is truth." That command therefore, for instance, to set "our affections on things above," will operate but faintly, till that spirit from which the command pro∣ceeds, touches the heart, and convinces it that no human good is worthy of the entire affection of an immortal creature. An unreserved faith in the promiser must precede our worthy performance of any duty to which the promise is annexed.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="025845_0163_0FCF6403B3ACBAB0"/>
But as to a set of duties enforced by no other motive than a bare acquiescence in their beauty, and a cold conviction of their propriety, but impelled by no obe∣dience to his authority who imposes them; though we know not how well they might be performed by pure and impeccable beings, yet we know how they commonly <HI>are</HI> performed by frail and dis∣orderly creatures, fallen from their in∣nocence, and corrupt in their very na∣tures.</P>
<P>Besides, nothing but a conviction of the truth of christianity can reconcile thinking beings to the extraordinary ap∣pearances of things in the Creator's moral government of the world. The works of God are an enigma, of which his word alone is the solution. The dark veil which is thrown over the divine dispen∣sations in this lower world, must natu∣rally shock those who consider only the
<PB N="158" REF="025845_0164_0FCF6406425050D0"/>
single scene which is acting on the pre∣sent stage; but is reconcileable to him who, having learnt from revelation the nature of the laws by which the great Author acts, trusts confidently that the catastrophe will set all to rights. The confusion which sin and the passions have introduced; the triumph of wickedness, the seemingly arbitrary disproportion of human conditions, accountable on no scheme but that which the Gospel has opened to us—have all a natural tenden∣cy to withdraw from the love of God the hearts of those who erect themselves into critics on the divine conduct, and yet will not study the plan, and get ac∣quainted with the rules, so far as it has pleased the Supreme Disposer to reveal them.</P>
<P>Till therefore the word of God is used as "a lamp to their paths," men can neither truly discern the crookedness of
<PB N="159" REF="025845_0165_0FCF640778535790"/>
their own ways, nor the perfection of that light by which they are directed to walk. And this light can only be seen by its own proper brightness; it has no other medium. Till therefore "the se∣cret of the Lord" is with men, they will not truly "fear him;" till he has "en∣larged their hearts" with the knowledge and belief of his word, they will not very vigorously "run the way of his com∣mandments." Till they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that "faith without which it is impossi∣ble to please God," they will not attain that holiness without which no man can see him.</P>
<P>And indeed if God has thought sit to make the gospel an instrument of salvati∣on, we must own the necessity of receiv∣ing it as a divine institution, before it is likely to operate very effectually on the conduct. The great Creator, if we may judge by analogy from natural things, is

so wise an oeconomist, that he always a∣dapts, with the most accurate precision, the instrument to the work; and never lavishes more means than are necessary to accomplish the proposed end. If there∣fore christianity had been intended for nothing more than a mere system of ethics such a system surely might have been produced at an infinitely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess expence. The long chain of pro∣ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy, the labours of apostles, the blood of saints, to say nothing of the great and costly sacrifice which the gospel records, might surely have been spared. Lessons of mere human virtue might have been delivered by some suitable instrument of human wisdom, strengthened by the visi∣ble authority of human power. A bare system of morals might have been com∣municated to mankind with a more rea∣sonable prospect of advantage, by means not so repugnant to human pride. A mere scheme of conduct might have been

delivered, with far greater probability of success, by Antoninus the emperor, or Plato the philosopher, than by Paul the tent-maker, or Peter the fisherman.</P>
<P>Christianity, then, must be embraced entirely, if it be received at all. It must be taken, without mutilation, as a per∣fect scheme, in the way in which God has been pleased to reveal it. It must be accepted, not as exhibiting beautiful parts, but as presenting one consummate whole, of which the perfection arises from coherence and dependence, from relation and consistency. Its power will be weakened, and its energy destroyed, if every caviller pulls out a pin, or ob∣structs a spring, with the presumptuous view of new modelling the divine work, and making it go to his own mind. There is no breaking this system into portions of which we are at liberty to choose one, and reject another. There is no sepa∣rating

the evidences from the doctrines, the doctrines from the precepts, belief from obedience, morality from piety, the love of our neighbour from the love of God. If we profess christianity at all, if we allow the Divine Author to be in∣deed unto us "wisdom and righteous∣ness," he must be also "sanctification and redemption."</P>
<P>Christianity, then, is assuredly some∣thing more than a mere set of rules; and piety, though it never pretended to be the substitute for a good life, is indis∣pensably necessary to its acceptance with God. The Gospel never offers to make religion supersede morality, but every where clearly proves that morality is not the whole of religion. Piety is not only necessary as a <HI>means,</HI> but is itself a most important <HI>end.</HI> It is not only the best principle of moral conduct, but is an in∣dispensable and absolute duty in itself.

It is not only the highest motive to the practice of virtue, but is a prior obliga∣tion; and absolutely necessary, even when detached from its immediate influence on practical goodness. Religion will survive all the virtues of which it is the source; for we shall be living in the no∣blest exercises of piety, when we shall have no objects on which to exercise many human virtues. When there will be no distress to be relieved, no injuries to be forgiven, no evil habits to be sub∣dued; there will be a Creator to be bles∣sed and adored, a Redeemer to be loved and praised.</P>
