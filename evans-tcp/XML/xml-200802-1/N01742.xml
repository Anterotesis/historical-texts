<HEAD>The Present Melancholy Circum∣stances of the PROVINCE Consider'd, and Methods for Redress humbly proposed, in a Letter from one in the Country to one in Boston.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE our last Discourse about the uneasie threatning Circumstances of this <HI>Pro∣vince,</HI> as to <HI>Money</HI> or a <HI>Medium</HI> of <HI>Trade.</HI> I have employed my thoughts somewhat in the matter, and I'll briefly hint some things that have occur'd to my mind.</P>
<P>OUR Fathers that first settled the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> brought some <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> with them, after a while, some <HI>Money</HI> was Coined here, as <HI>Shillings, Six-Pences,</HI> &amp;c. But in process of time, (even long before <HI>Silver</HI> Money was generally <HI>Exported,</HI> or carried out of the Province,) the greatest part of the <HI>passing Money</HI> here, was <HI>Spanish,</HI> viz. <HI>Pieces of Eight, Half Pieces, Eight Pences,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>This Money</HI> I sup∣pose was chiefly the <HI>Returns</HI> made for our <HI>Fish, Lumber, Horses, Grain, Beaf, Pork,</HI> &amp;c. Exported or carried out of the Country. I think this demonstrates, that in those times what we <HI>Exported</HI> of our <HI>own produce</HI> (or the fruits of
<PB N="2" REF="002067_0002_0FBB78FE535274F8"/>
our own labour,) was more than what was <HI>Im∣ported</HI> from other Places, either for <HI>Food, Drink,</HI> or <HI>Cloathing;</HI> therefore to make the <HI>Ballance, Money</HI> came in, and continued Circulating a∣mong us. In those times the Wealth of this Country was on the <HI>growing band.</HI> But of late Years, I'll suppose the <HI>Twenty</HI> last past, our <HI>Silver Money</HI> has been generally <HI>Exported,</HI> so that now there is not a <HI>Penny</HI> of it passing be∣tween Man and Man. Tho' I don't know ex∣actly (nor I believe any one else) how much <HI>Money</HI> has been <HI>Exported</HI> this last <HI>Twenty Years,</HI> yet I'll now suppose it to be <HI>Three Hundred Thousand Pounds;</HI> and I'll suppose we have now about <HI>Two Hundred Thousand Pounds</HI> out in <HI>Province Bills;</HI> what's out in <HI>Province Bills,</HI> and to be Collected by <HI>Tax,</HI> the Province <HI>owes</HI> for, and is so much <HI>in Debt;</HI> what's out upon <HI>Loan,</HI> is owing for by <HI>particular Persons</HI> in the Province, so that the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of this Province owe for the whole. Now if the guess I have made be exact, (which I don't pretend to) or pretty near it, then this <HI>Province</HI> in what is <HI>spent</HI> and what is <HI>owed</HI> for, are about <HI>Five Hundred Thousand Pounds</HI> sunk in their Estates, in about <HI>Twenty Years.</HI> If my guess be right in the <HI>Silver Exported,</HI> and the <HI>Province Bills</HI> now out, then the Conclusion I've drawn must needs be true.</P>
<P>BUT how comes it that we have sunk so
<PB N="3" REF="002067_0003_0FBB78FF87043808"/>
much in our Estates, in so short a time? If any think it occasioned by the <HI>Wars</HI> we have had in the last <HI>Twenty Years;</HI> I'm humbly of a different Sentiment; for we did <HI>not hire Fo∣reigners</HI> to manage our <HI>Wars.</HI> This Province did not send away <HI>Silver Money,</HI> to hire assist∣ance against <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>French.</HI> My opinion therefore is, that our <HI>decay in Wealth</HI> is chiefly owing to our <HI>Mismanagements,</HI> especially our <HI>Extravagance.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is <HI>Imported</HI> into the Province, &amp; <HI>Spent</HI> here, is, or should be <HI>Paid for;</HI> else we are <HI>dishonest,</HI> which does not become <HI>Men,</HI> much less <HI>Christians,</HI> as we are: And if the Fruits and <HI>Produce of our own Labour in this Province,</HI> won't make a sufficient <HI>Export</HI> to pay for what we receive <HI>from Abroad,</HI> and <HI>Spend</HI> here; then the <HI>Silver</HI> goes to make the <HI>Ballance,</HI> and pay the remainder.</P>
<P>AND this is the very Case, the short and long of the Business. Our <HI>Silver</HI> is gone to pay the <HI>overplus</HI> of <HI>Imported Goods,</HI> above what our own <HI>Product Exported,</HI> could pay. Among the Commodities <HI>Imported,</HI> some are really <HI>useful</HI> for us, which we are not able to <HI>raise,</HI> or <HI>make</HI> our selves, some not at all, some not as yet, or not enough of it, as <HI>Canvas, Riggin, Brass, Copper, Pewter, Tin-Ware, Glass</HI> for Windows, <HI>Sugar, Melosses, Cotton-Wool, Paper, Needles, Pins, Scythes, Sickles, Cutlary Ware,</HI> &amp;c. I sup∣pose
<PB N="4" REF="002067_0004_0FBB7900F91F8130"/>
our <HI>own Produce</HI> (if we joyned <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI> together) which might be <HI>Ex∣ported,</HI> would be enough to pay for all the <HI>Im∣ported</HI> Commodities, which are really <HI>needful</HI> and <HI>useful</HI> for us.</P>
<P>BUT then many things have been <HI>Imported,</HI> which have <HI>not been necessary,</HI> yet very costly; such as <HI>Silver and Gold Lace,</HI> worn on <HI>Cloaths</HI> and <HI>Shoes, Velvet, Rich Silk, Sattin, Silk Stockings, Fine Broad-Cloths, Camlets, Perriwiggs, Fine costly Shoes and Pattoons, Ribbons, Rich Lace, Silk-Han∣kerchiefs, Fine Hatts, Gloves</HI> of great price and little worth, <HI>China Ware,</HI> very <HI>Costly-Looking∣Glasses, Cane-Chairs, Costly Beds &amp; Furniture,</HI> &amp;c. We in the Country, think that <HI>some scores of Thousands of Pounds</HI> in late Years, have been spent by this Province in these things, and that the Province would have been much better without them. I don't now contend against these things as being <HI>Unlawful in themselves;</HI> but for us to send off our <HI>Silver Money</HI> to buy them, &amp; now not have a Penny to pass between Man &amp; Man for our necessary business, I think has not been our <HI>Prudence</HI> but our great <HI>Folly.</HI></P>
<P>POSSIBLY some will say, the fault is in the <HI>Middling</HI> or <HI>Poorer</HI> sort of People, who buy these things, and go <HI>above their Ability,</HI> in doing it. The reply is, Possibly it has been great <HI>weakness</HI> in the <HI>Richer</HI> sort to lead in these things, and <HI>greater folly</HI> in the <HI>Poorer</HI> to follow them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002067_0005_0FBB79098DED3750"/>
HOWEVER, its matter of Fact, that there's much <HI>needless Expence</HI> in sundry of these things, and tho' some <HI>Richer</HI> Persons or Families can bear the <HI>Cost</HI> of these Expences, yet <HI>Poorer</HI> ones (who too much affect them) can't; but whether such things are spent by <HI>Rich</HI> or <HI>Poor,</HI> its all one to the Province in general. For what's <HI>Imported</HI> and spent in the Province must be paid for by <HI>Export</HI> from it; and if the <HI>Pro∣duce of our Labour</HI> won't do it, our <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold</HI> must go (or rather is gone) to make it up.</P>
<P>AND as I'm humbly of Opinion, that this Pro∣vince had much better have been without, many <HI>Scores of Thousands of Pounds</HI> of fine costly things <HI>Imported</HI> &amp; <HI>spent</HI> here; so I believe other things tho' <HI>useful</HI> in their <HI>time &amp; measure,</HI> have been <HI>Im∣ported</HI> and Spent in <HI>greater Quantities,</HI> than has been for our good, Such as <HI>Wine, Rum, Brandy,</HI> (not to mention <HI>Tea, Coffee, Chacolet,</HI> which People here formerly did very well without) that there has been much <HI>needless Expence</HI> in these things, I suppose none will deny. So far and so fre∣quently as any have drunk to <HI>excess,</HI> the Sin of <HI>Drunkènness</HI> has been chargeable on them, which they should seriously and penitently consider of; but I'm now considering the mat∣ter, as to <HI>Cost</HI> of such <HI>Imported Liquors.</HI> If <HI>several Thousand Pounds Yearly,</HI> are <HI>needlesly</HI> spent in these things, so many <HI>Thousands a Year</HI> we are hurt even on this account, that our <HI>Export</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002067_0006_0FBB790AE79627C0"/>
does not (without sending off <HI>Silver</HI>) equal our <HI>Import.</HI> If out of our <HI>own Produce,</HI> a Cargo of <HI>Staves, Hoops, Horses, &amp;c.</HI> has for its <HI>return,</HI> a Cargo of <HI>Wine</HI> or <HI>Rum,</HI> and <HI>one Third</HI> of it is <HI>needlesly</HI> expended and wasted here; if instead of this <HI>Third</HI> needlesly spent, the return had been made in <HI>Silver,</HI> I think this might be call'd <HI>double gain.</HI> And since as to the <HI>Cost part</HI> (besides the <HI>Sin</HI> of Intemperance) we are much hurt by the <HI>needless Expence</HI> of <HI>Imported Liquors;</HI> I conceive that the <HI>needless</HI> multiply∣ing <HI>Taverns</HI> and <HI>Retailers,</HI> tends further to im∣poverish us. For Persons thus <HI>employ'd</HI> think to get a <HI>Living</HI> by their <HI>Business,</HI> and so are for <HI>drawing</HI> and <HI>vending</HI> as much <HI>Liquor</HI> as they can, and its to be fear'd, criminally incourage others to buy, and the more is spent for what's <HI>Imported,</HI> the more must be <HI>Exported</HI> in one thing or other to <HI>Pay</HI> for it. And tho' some may think it a <HI>Publick advantage</HI> to <HI>multiply Licences</HI> for <HI>selling of Drink,</HI> to draw more <HI>Excise Mo∣ney</HI> into the <HI>Treasury;</HI> yet I conceive it to be a <HI>Publick hurt,</HI> because our <HI>Import</HI> must be ans∣wered by our <HI>Export;</HI> and yet we have not e∣nough of the latter to do it; therefore our <HI>Silver Money</HI> is gone. A <HI>needless</HI> mul∣tiplying of <HI>Retailers,</HI> whether of <HI>Drink</HI> or <HI>Shop Goods,</HI> is no advantage to the Publick. For if the same Goods are bought by <HI>Ten Persons</HI> one after another, with design to Sell again,
<PB N="7" REF="002067_0007_0FBB790C4CB54FA8"/>
before the Person buys them that designs to <HI>wear</HI> or <HI>use</HI> them; each of those <HI>Ten Persons</HI> aims at <HI>Gain</HI> in passing thro' his hands, and the <HI>last</HI> buyer and <HI>user</HI> pays it all; whereas if he had bought it of the <HI>first</HI> or <HI>second Seller,</HI> he might have sav'd the <HI>gain</HI> which the other <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine</HI> Persons had, and those Persons might have been im∣ploy'd in other Business. For tho' in this case sup∣posed, the <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine needless Retailers,</HI> get some gain to themselves, and the last <HI>buyer</HI> and <HI>user</HI> pays it all, yet the <HI>Province,</HI> or <HI>Publick</HI> is not enrich'd <HI>one Farthing</HI> by their labour. If they had been employ'd in <HI>Husbandry,</HI> or <HI>Handycraft-Business;</HI> there would probably have been some produce of their labour for the Publick Good; either <HI>Grain, Cattle, Hemp, Flax raised,</HI> or <HI>Cloath, Shoes,</HI> or <HI>Utensils</HI> made, which might be ser∣viceable to themselves or others; but their <HI>meer banding of Goods one to another,</HI> no more increases any Wealth in the Province, than Persons <HI>at a Fire</HI> increase the <HI>Water in a Pail,</HI> by passing it thro' <HI>Twenty</HI> or <HI>Forty hands.</HI> This matter might be considered, as to <HI>Petty Shops,</HI> especially <HI>Huck∣sters</HI> and <HI>Forestallers of the Market.</HI> I would not be thought here to condemn <HI>Retailing</HI> in general, for doubtless Persons may get an <HI>honest Living</HI> by it, and those who <HI>buy</HI> of them may be <HI>gainers</HI> too, by having the Commodities brought <HI>nearer,</HI> which prevents the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Expence</HI> of <HI>travelling</HI> farther for them. It's therefore only
<PB N="8" REF="002067_0008_0FBB790DFA3926C0"/>
a <HI>needless Retailing</HI> (whether of <HI>Drink</HI> or other <HI>Commodities</HI>) which I look on as hurtful to the Publick, because the Persons so employed, real∣ly <HI>raise or produce no good to the Public<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which they might do if labouring in some other and proper business. <HI>Needless Retailers,</HI> with respect to any Publick benefit, are really <HI>Idlers;</HI> they help to spend what is <HI>Raised</HI> or <HI>Imported,</HI> but produce neither by their labour.</P>
<P>THUS I've hinted by what way and means I conceive our <HI>Silver</HI> has been <HI>Exported,</HI> and we are sunk so <HI>deep in Debt,</HI> viz. by <HI>Importing</HI> and spending many things which we had better been without; and by an <HI>excessive spending</HI> some things <HI>Imported,</HI> which in themselves consider'd, and in their <HI>time</HI> and <HI>measure</HI> may be reckon'd <HI>useful.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Question is, How to <HI>redress this grievance, &amp; extricate our selves from these diffi∣culties.</HI> I think this Question is not improper to be thought upon, by any one that wishes well to this Province, as I'm sure I heartily do. My Opinion is, that we can't suddenly or at once get rid of these difficulties, which our own <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Extravagance</HI> have brought us into. Yet I Con∣jecture, that in a few Years time, by an ordinary course of Providence we might gradually free our selves from them. When a <HI>Traveller</HI> knows he has missed his way, he often goes back in the same Path, 'till he's sure that he is in the right
<PB N="9" REF="002067_0009_0FBB791590D7A928"/>
road again. I think we should take the same method. In the mean time, let us Cultivate <HI>Peace, Love, Unity,</HI> not be hard on one another for diffe∣rent sentiments, about ways to mend our Cir∣cumstances; let us not foment <HI>Parties</HI> and <HI>Facti∣ons,</HI> but studiously avoid them, as we love GOD and our COUNTRY, <HI>Every City or House divided against it self, shall not stand.</HI> Thus watching against Discord, I'll say, Let not Merchants <HI>Import needless Commodities,</HI> or if they do, let us <HI>not buy or use</HI> them; nor use <HI>more than needs</HI> of what is <HI>useful</HI> in it self.</P>
<P>LET no <HI>Wool, Hides, Leather, Grain</HI> nor <HI>Candles</HI> be <HI>Exported,</HI> when at a dear price. Let us grow more <HI>Frugal</HI> in <HI>furnishing &amp; adorning</HI> our Houses, in our <HI>Cloths, Food</HI> and <HI>Drink,</HI> this we might do (many at least) without hurting our Bodies by <HI>Cold, Thirst</HI> or <HI>Hunger.</HI> Let us be diligent and la∣borious, to <HI>raise, produce, make</HI> as much as we can for our own support, as to <HI>Food, Raiment, Tools, Utensils.</HI> Let <HI>Husbandry,</HI> (tilling theground) be more diligently and generally followed, that <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Flesh</HI> may be rais'd, and <HI>Barley</HI> to make <HI>Drink,</HI> that so the less <HI>Imported Drink</HI> might be called for. Let us raise more <HI>Sheep &amp; Flax,</HI> and make as much of our own <HI>Clothing,</HI> both <HI>Woollen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Linnen</HI> as possibly we can. If People would gene∣rally &amp; <HI>purposely chuse,</HI> to wear <HI>Cloths,</HI> (Woollen &amp; Linnen) <HI>Stockens, Shoes, Gloves, Hatts,</HI> of our own Country make; this would <HI>incourage</HI> more to
<PB N="10" REF="002067_0010_0FBB791785E402C8"/>
<HI>Employ</HI> themselves in <HI>making these,</HI> &amp; in grow∣ing more <HI>skilful</HI> and <HI>exact</HI> at it, and would pre∣vent the <HI>Import</HI> of many Thousands a Year, for which (among other unnecessaries) our <HI>Silver</HI> is gone. <HI>Two Rules</HI> well observed would help us, viz. Let us by diligent labour <HI>raise</HI> &amp; <HI>make</HI> as much as we can for our selves, of <HI>Food, Raiment, Uten∣sils, &amp;c.</HI> and buy no more of <HI>Imported</HI> Goods than <HI>necessity</HI> requires, I say, the observing these Rules would soon <HI>turn the Scales,</HI> and better our Cir∣cumstances: I'm humbly of opinion, that a Thousand Schemes about <HI>Banks</HI> and <HI>Paper-Mo∣ney,</HI> would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t help us like this. If this course were well followed a few Years, we should then live more on our <HI>own Produce,</HI> than now we do; we should <HI>raise m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re</HI> for <HI>Export</HI> than now we do; and our <HI>Export</HI> in <HI>Fish, Oyl, Whalebone, Horses, Lumber, &amp;c.</HI> would far more than pay for <HI>ne∣cessary Importations,</HI> and therefore the <HI>overplus</HI> would naturally (as it were) return in <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold,</HI> and so we should have <HI>such Money</HI> as plenty as ever. But the longer we continue in our <HI>present course</HI> of spending so much of <HI>Im∣ported Commodities,</HI> and <HI>raising so little by our own labours,</HI> so much the deeper we necessarily sink into misery. By this present course we are in, we take off the <HI>Manufactures</HI> and <HI>main∣tain the Labourers</HI> of other parts, even as far as the <HI>East Indies,</HI> (by the <HI>Silks, Muslins, &amp;c.</HI> we have from thence) and <HI>pay</HI> for it (so far as 'tis
<PB N="11" REF="002067_0011_0FBB791905AFD368"/>
done) not out of our <HI>Labour,</HI> but our <HI>Stock,</HI> for our <HI>Silver</HI> is gone already, &amp; we are deep in debt into bargain. Our foolish <HI>fondness of Forreign Commodities &amp; Fashions</HI> has almost ruin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d us. How many Thousand Pounds within this Two or Three Years have been Expended, in only one particular instance, viz. <HI>Camlets</HI> and <HI>trim∣ming</HI> for <HI>Rising-Hoods,</HI> and in <HI>making</HI> them? Has not <HI>Three Quarters</HI> of this, if not more, been <HI>needless;</HI> tho' the labour in <HI>making</HI> has been paid for here, yet the <HI>Imported Materials</HI> must be paid for by some <HI>Export.</HI> If we had now <HI>Five Hundred Thousand Pounds in Silver Currant</HI> among us, I believe 'twould soon be carried off, if we did not alter our present course, viz. to be <HI>less fond of Forreign Commo∣dities,</HI> and to be <HI>more laborious to raise Necessa∣ries for our selves.</HI></P>
<P>WE in the Country think, that <HI>Plotting heads, Proud hearts,</HI> and <HI>Idle hands,</HI> will never maintain a People; and that a close following the <HI>Wheel</HI> within doors, and the <HI>Plough</HI> without are much better and stronger Politicks. Many complain they <HI>scarce know how to live,</HI> and I don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t won∣der at it, for many affect to live <HI>higher</HI> than they <HI>need,</HI> or can <HI>bear.</HI> You in <HI>Boston</HI> go <HI>very fine,</HI> we in the Country are smattering at it, and coming to it, by degrees. First by <HI>clipping and debasing Silver Money,</HI> then by <HI>sending it away,</HI> and the coming of <HI>Paper Money</HI> in the
<PB N="12" REF="002067_0012_0FBB791A8AA7C0B0"/>
room of it; I say, hereby <HI>Merchants Imported Goods</HI> are come to an <HI>Extravagant Advance.</HI> When we buy <HI>European</HI> or <HI>West-India</HI> Goods, we give for some <HI>double,</HI> for others <HI>more than double</HI> the Price that was given <HI>Fifteen</HI> or <HI>Twen∣ty</HI> Years ago. This necessitates us in the <HI>Coun∣try,</HI> to <HI>raise in some proportion</HI> the Price of our <HI>Grain, Flesh, Wood, Hay, Butter, Cheese, &amp;c.</HI> We formerly Sold <HI>Butter, Six pence a Pound,</HI> that <HI>Six Pence</HI> would buy <HI>Two Pounds of Sugar,</HI> and if we now have <HI>Nine pence</HI> a Pound for <HI>Butter,</HI> that <HI>Nine pence</HI> will buy but <HI>One Pound of Su∣gar,</HI> or thereabouts. So that when we receive so great a Price as we do, yet we find it hard enough to rub along; and the more so, because <HI>Boston distemper</HI> is got into the <HI>Country,</HI> that is, <HI>We</HI> and our <HI>Families</HI> are fond of many <HI>needless Imported Commodities,</HI> and must pay the <HI>Impor∣ters</HI> or Merchants an Extravagant rate for them. If this <HI>raising on one another</HI> in Trade, <HI>helps</HI> some, yet it <HI>hurts</HI> more.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing which very much deserves our consideration is, That <HI>Salary Men, Mini∣sters, School-Masters, Judges of the Circuit, Pre∣sident &amp; Tutors</HI> at <HI>Colledge, Widows</HI> and <HI>Orphans, &amp;c.</HI> are pincht and hurt more than any; for while they pay it may be double or more, both for <HI>Imported Goods,</HI> and the <HI>Produce of the Coun∣try,</HI> yet their <HI>Salaries</HI> are not increas'd (if at all) <HI>in proportion,</HI> to what the <HI>Merchant</HI> and
<PB N="13" REF="002067_0013_0FBB791DB82BBAF0"/>
<HI>Husbandman</HI> raises upon one another, tho' they must buy of <HI>both.</HI> If Justice and Equity don't say, their <HI>Salaries</HI> ought to be increas'd, let any one judge.</P>
<P>BUT possibly some will say, if we do our ut∣most to <HI>raise necessaries for our selves,</HI> and buy no more than <HI>necessity</HI> requires of <HI>Imported Com∣modities,</HI> this course will spoil <HI>Merchandizing</HI> and <HI>Trading.</HI> I reply, the good of the whole should be preferred to that of a part. <HI>Mer∣chandizing</HI> and <HI>Trading</HI> are necessary and <HI>profita∣ble</HI> for us, if well manag'd; but mismanage∣ment therein, may hurt a People. <HI>Trading</HI> has carried off our <HI>Money,</HI> we have not a <HI>Shilling</HI> in <HI>Silver</HI> Passing, and we are deep in Debt; has <HI>not this Trading</HI> almost ruin'd us? Is not this, to <HI>buy and sell and live by the loss?</HI> It is not profi∣table to the Publick, to have <HI>too many</HI> of any <HI>particular Trade or Calling,</HI> for they must either be <HI>idle</HI> (when they might be imploy'd in proper business) or labour <HI>for little or nothing,</HI> which is unprofitable to themselves, and to the Pub∣lick therein. If there be Merchants enough to manage the <HI>Export</HI> we can <HI>raise,</HI> and the <HI>Import we need,</HI> there's enough; <HI>Supernumera∣ries</HI> are <HI>hurtful</HI> not <HI>serviceable</HI> to the Publick; 'twould be better they were imploy'd in other business.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY, some think, that the Emitting <HI>more Paper Money</HI> would bring us out of our

difficulties, but I'm humbly of another Opinion. I think some engaged in Trade have observ'd, that since the Emitting the <HI>last Hundred Thou∣sand Pounds,</HI> the <HI>Price</HI> of Commodities <HI>Imported,</HI> and of our own <HI>Produce,</HI> has been considerably <HI>rais'd;</HI> which is not so much from the <HI>scarcity</HI> of such <HI>Commodities,</HI> as from the <HI>mean opinion</HI> Persons have of the <HI>passing Money.</HI> The last I have heard is, that when <HI>Silver Money</HI> is Sold (now and then a little as some can get it) it fetches <HI>Eleven</HI> or <HI>Twelve Shillings</HI> an <HI>Ounce</HI> in <HI>Paper Money;</HI> whereas according to our <HI>Law (Seventeen Penny Weight at Six Shillings) Silver</HI> Money is but a very small matter more than <HI>Seven Shillings an Ounce.</HI> This plainly shows the <HI>low value</HI> People have for <HI>Paper Money.</HI> It seems as tho' the more 'tis <HI>increas'd</HI> the <HI>less 'tis valued.</HI> I'm prone to think, that if <HI>every Fa∣mily</HI> in the Province, had a <HI>Thousand Pounds in Paper Money; Twenty Shillings</HI> of it, would not then buy so much, as <HI>Five Shillings</HI> will now. In this Province, People generally desire to be <HI>Freehold,</HI> they don't chuse to be <HI>Tenants,</HI> and <HI>pay Rent.</HI> But if we <HI>take up Money</HI> whether of the <HI>Province</HI> or <HI>particular Persons,</HI> on our <HI>Lands;</HI> we so far become <HI>Tenants</HI> to the <HI>Lenders,</HI> and <HI>pay Rent</HI> to them. And if we can't pay when what's borrowed is regularly call'd for, but a <HI>Course of Law</HI> recovers <HI>Land</HI> from us; possibly <HI>more Land</HI> will be taken, then we should have

been willing to have Sold, for <HI>half so much more</HI> as we have <HI>borrowed.</HI> Possibly some who have <HI>taken up Money on their Lands,</HI> by being uncapable of paying will <HI>lose them; Frugality</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI> would have been a greater kind∣ness to such, than their <HI>hiring Money</HI> was.</P>
<P>THIS (out of true love to my dear Country, where I was born, and hitherto have liv'd, without ill will to any Person or Persons whatsoever,) I've freely given you some hints of my Opinion, about our present uncomforta∣ble Circumstances; you may consider 'em, and communicate 'em to your Neighbours if they I do any good. If you see meet to return your own thoughts to me in Writing, I should be glad of your Opinion as to the following Queries, viz.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Richer and Abler Persons and Families,</HI> would abate considerably of their <HI>Rich needless fineries, and costly way of living;</HI> therein giving a <HI>leading Example</HI> to Inferiors?</P>
<P>IF needless Extravagant Expences at <HI>Wed∣dings &amp; Funerals</HI> were retrench'd; and no <HI>Gloves</HI> but of our own make, given at either; nor <HI>Drink</HI> at Funerals but of our <HI>own produce;</HI> nor <HI>Scarves</HI> but for Persons of some <HI>distinguish'd drunk?</HI></P>
<P>IF <HI>Counsellors, Ministers, Militay Commission Officers,</HI> would <HI>purposely</HI> wear <HI>Garments, Shoes, Stockings, Gloves, Hatts,</HI> (as soon as they can get 'em) of our <HI>own make?</HI></P>
<P>IF considerable encouragement were given
<PB N="16" REF="002067_0016_0FBB7926960E6C60"/>
by the <HI>Publick</HI> for the <HI>Raising</HI> and <HI>Manufactur∣ing</HI> of <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax,</HI> especially that the <HI>Poor</HI> in <HI>Town and Country</HI> might be <HI>Employ'd;</HI> and for <HI>Manufacturing of Iron,</HI> (whereof there is plenty of <HI>Oar</HI> in the Land,) especially in Cast∣ing <HI>Potts, Kettles,</HI> making <HI>Nails</HI> of various sorts, &amp;c.?</P>
<P>IF <HI>Waste Lands</HI> within Townships were Tax'd, to make the Owners themselves <HI>Improve</HI> 'em, or <HI>Sell</HI> 'em to those that would, for the produ∣cing <HI>more plenty</HI> of <HI>Grain, Flesh, Butter, Cheese, Wool,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHETHER these Methods would not be of Publick Service?</P>
<P>BUT as to my own Opinion, 'tis in short what I said before, to <HI>raise what we can </HI> by our own labour, to supply our selves, and to buy no more than <HI>necessity</HI> requires of <HI>Imported Goods,</HI> is the most sure way to relieve us.</P>
