<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>ND is <HI>this thy Voice,</HI> O Our SAVIOUR? A most won∣derful Word! What? The <HI>Great GOD who formed all Things;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Omnipotent GOD, speak such a Word, unto <HI>Frail Creatures,</HI> that are the Works of His Hands! <HI>I Marry my self unto you.</HI> The <HI>Most High Possessor of Heaven and
<PB N="2" REF="002040_0003_0FBA8551D3E4D988"/>
Earth,</HI> speak such a Word unto <HI>Poor Creatures,</HI> who have nothing but what He gives unto them! <HI>I Marry my self unto you.</HI> The most Holy One, who is of <HI>purer Eyes than to behold Evil,</HI> speak such a Word, unto <HI>Vile Creatures,</HI> which are all <HI>gone aside</HI> and <HI>all together become filthy! I Marry my self unto you.</HI> O Won∣derful! O Wonderful! But so it is. <HI>O Lord GOD, Thou art that GOD, and thy Words are True, and thou hast promised this Goodness unto all that are willing to become the Objects of it!</HI></P>
<P>Great is the <HI>Honour</HI> which the Glori∣ous GOD has put upon the <HI>Married State.</HI> He <HI>Honoured</HI> it, when He <HI>Appointed</HI> it in <HI>Paradise,</HI> and made it an <HI>Institution</HI> for our <HI>First Parents,</HI> while they were yet in their sinless Integrity. He <HI>Honoured</HI> it, by doing at it the First of those <HI>Mi∣racles,</HI> wherein His Divinity shone forth under the <HI>Eclipse</HI> of His Humanity. He has <HI>Honoured</HI> it, in the Desirable Effects of it, and the <HI>Glories</HI> of Mankind, which it has produced in Successive Generati∣ons. On such Accounts <HI>Marriage is Ho∣nourable in all.</HI> But we have no small Addition to the Accounts on which it is
<PB N="3" REF="002040_0004_0FBA8552A6D62F38"/>
so, In that our GOD has made a <HI>Marri∣age</HI> to be the <HI>Figure,</HI> by which He will have to be livelily described unto us, the marvellous <HI>Relation,</HI> and <HI>Affection,</HI> which He bears unto His Chosen People.</P>
<P><HI>Israel,</HI> Backsliden from GOD, is advised and Exhorted unto a <HI>Repentance:</HI> which being obtained, they shall be re∣turned from their Dispersion among the Nations; tho' there should be but One to be found in a <HI>City,</HI> or Two in a <HI>Tribe</HI> dispersed among the Nations, yet they shall be brought back unto their Anci∣ent Sears, and God will <HI>shew wonders to the dead.</HI> The COVENANT be∣tween the Glorious God, and His Back∣sliding People, is brought as an Argu∣ment for the <HI>Repentance</HI> that is called for. And the Nature, the Import, of the COVENANT is declared. It is a <HI>Covenant</HI> of <HI>Marriage; I Marry my self unto you saith the Lord.</HI> It is thus <HI>Active∣ly,</HI> to be expressed, I <HI>Marry my self,</HI> ra∣ther than <HI>I am Married.</HI> Indeed the Ar∣gument here used, is urged with a <HI>Com∣passion</HI> scarce to be found among the <HI>Hard-hearted</HI> Children of Men. Adulter∣ous violations of the <HI>Covenant</HI> between
<PB N="4" REF="002040_0005_0FBA855457566938"/>
the <HI>Married,</HI> especially, if Repeated, if de∣fended, if long persisted in; These render all Accomodations between them forever hopeless. An Everlasting <HI>Divorce</HI> is all that can be hoped for. The word <HI>Return,</HI> is never heard any more. But, <HI>my Thoughts are not your Thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</HI> Our compassionate God says unto a People in <HI>Covenant</HI> with him; <HI>Thou hast plaid the Harlot with many Lovers, yet Return a∣gain unto me.</HI> And the <HI>Marriage</HI> that has been so horribly Violated, is made the Argument for this <HI>Return.</HI> Our God will yet own the <HI>Marriage;</HI> and go on with all the Testimonies of Love that can be a∣greeable to a <HI>Marriage;</HI> and all former offences will be forgiven and forgotten, and be as if they had never been at all. How <HI>Unchangeable</HI> the <HI>Love</HI> of our God! <HI>Because I change not,</HI> Therefore says our God, O Sinners, <HI>you are not consumed.</HI> A Goodness, at which, O <HI>Sinful</HI> Children of Men, how can we but be astonished! But with our Astonishments, how much is a <HI>Repenting Soul,</HI> having such a <HI>Mar∣riage</HI> in view, to be encouraged! Well, who is the Lord that says, <HI>I Marry my¦self
<PB N="5" REF="002040_0006_0FBA8555DE623A90"/>
unto you?</HI> Truly 'Tis the Lord whose Name is JEHOVAH. Now the Son of GOD, who is the God that is the <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit;</HI> but who becomes <HI>Incarnate</HI> in our Jesus: This is He whose Name is JEHOVAH. We have all the evidence which the O∣racles of our God can give us, That the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> in the <HI>Old Testament</HI> is the same that appears in the Character of the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> our <HI>Immanuel,</HI> the <HI>Word made flesh,</HI> in the <HI>New.</HI> It is our Glorious CHRIST, who says, <HI>I Marry my self unto you.</HI></P>
<P>My Doctrine that is to <HI>drop as the Rain</HI> upon you, will be this.</P>
<P><HI>Our Great SAVIOUR, The Great GOD our SAVIOUR, bringing His People into a Covenant of Grace, does most graciously MARRY Himself unto them.</HI></P>
<P>It is to <HI>distil as the small rain upon the tender Herb.</HI> And therefore it shall be broken into some Heart-melting Propo∣sitions.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> It is to His CHURCH in the World, the People whom He calls out of the
<PB N="6" REF="002040_0007_0FBA85577436B300"/>
World, into His <HI>Covenant,</HI> that our SA∣VIOUR says, <HI>I Marry my self unto you.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Church,</HI> that has this Dignity put upon it; Rev. XXI. 9. <HI>The Wise to the Lamb of GOD.</HI> Of the <HI>Church</HI> does our SAVI∣OUR say, 'Tis <HI>the dearly Beloved of my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Church Universal</HI> is to be first of all considered, as thus <HI>Married</HI> unto the Son of GOD. Even that whole Body of People, who come into the Hands of our SAVIOUR, that so they may <HI>glorify God, and enjoy Him forever.</HI> There is a COVE∣NANT, which GOD our SAVIOUR has made with His Eternal FATHER, con∣cerning a people, which he has chosen, to be the <HI>Vessels of mercy in Glory</HI> forever. In this <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> GOD our SAVIOUR has engaged, That He will recover this His People out of the <HI>Ruins,</HI> which by their departure from God they are fallen into; That He will there∣fore make Expiation for their offences, by the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of Himself, and so recon∣cile them unto God: And that He will then put the <HI>Fear of God</HI> into their hearts, and <HI>shew them the path of Life,</HI> and <HI>Quic∣ken</HI> them to live unto God, and at last
<PB N="7" REF="002040_0008_0FBA8558E3026700"/>
raise them from the dead unto <HI>Everlast∣ing Life.</HI> In every Age, and in every Place, the Almighty Spirit of God, finds out these <HI>Elect,</HI> and makes them willing, that GOD their SAVIOUR should ac∣complish these His Engagements for them; willing to be <HI>Sav'd,</HI> and <HI>Led,</HI> and <HI>Rul'd</HI> by this mighty SAVIOUR. The <HI>method of Grace,</HI> which the <HI>Covenant of Redemption</HI> has laid out, for our Salva∣tion by a Glorious CHRIST, is brought unto us, in the <HI>Gospel of our Salvation,</HI> as a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> which we are to come into. The <HI>Gospel</HI> is the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God; it brings to us a <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> By being made willing to have our Saviour do for us, what He has pro∣mised His Father to do for His People, and be concerned for us, as our <HI>Peace-ma∣ker,</HI> our <HI>Instructor,</HI> and our <HI>Governour;</HI> we come into His <HI>Covenant.</HI> The People brought into this Covenant is the Church of God. Now, unto this whole People does our dear Saviour say, I <HI>Marry my self unto you.</HI></P>
<P>There is one whole Book of our BI∣BLE that appears written on purpose to Represent and Celebrate, this Heavenly
<PB N="8" REF="002040_0009_0FBA855DB8CD9870"/>
mystery. Tis the Book which we call, <HI>The</HI> CANTICLES. In that <HI>Song of Songs,</HI> written by <HI>Solomon,</HI> there is introduced a <HI>Prince,</HI> who has upon him some Re∣semblance of <HI>David,</HI> the admired Father of <HI>Solomon;</HI> but yet it is in the Quality and Apparel of an <HI>High-priest</HI> that this <HI>Prince</HI> is here exhibited. And this Illus∣trious Person here <HI>Marries</HI> Himself unto a Lady, with many mutual Endearments. Tis our SAVIOUR, who is the <HI>Bridegroom;</HI> 'Tis the Church which is the <HI>Bride,</HI> in this <HI>Dramatic</HI> Poem. The <HI>Emblem</HI> thus prosecuted by <HI>Solomon,</HI> is but an Enlarge∣ment upon what he had learn'd from the <HI>Forty fifth Psalm,</HI> which his Father <HI>Da∣vid</HI> had composed for him. From hence it is that the Jews have their curious Traditions, of the <HI>Marriage</HI> between <HI>Ti∣pheret</HI> and <HI>Malcuth;</HI> between the <HI>Beauty</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> that is to say, between the <HI>Messiah</HI> and the <HI>People</HI> that submit unto Him. We have now and then occur∣ring in our Sacred Pages, the <HI>Marriage</HI> of an <HI>Hero,</HI> which is attended with cir∣cumstances, that lead us to think, on our Saviour saying to His People, <HI>I Mar∣ry my self unto you.</HI> The Condition of
<PB N="9" REF="002040_0010_0FBA8560A30FB928"/>
things between our Saviour, and the Peo∣ple of His Covenant, is the Original from whence the <HI>Marriage</HI> allow'd and or∣dain'd, and common among the children of Men, is <HI>Copied.</HI> But the most notable <HI>Copy</HI> taken from that <HI>Original,</HI> was the <HI>Marriage</HI> of our <HI>First Parents,</HI> in the Gar∣den of God. Of that <HI>marriage,</HI> our Apo∣stle speaking, presently adds; Eph. V. 32. <HI>This is a great Mystery; but I speak of Christ and the Church.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Inchoation</HI> of this <HI>Marriage,</HI> is in <HI>this World.</HI> The <HI>Elect</HI> of God coming to say, <HI>I am the Lords,</HI> and <HI>Avouching</HI> a Glo∣rious CHRIST for their God and Saviour, the Grand Affair of the <HI>Marriage</HI> is car∣ried on. 'Tis come to a Contraction. But the consummation of the <HI>Marriage</HI> is in the <HI>World to come.</HI> 'Twill be at the <HI>Second Coming</HI> of our Saviour, that there will be that <HI>voice</HI> heard, as the <HI>voice of many waters,</HI> and the <HI>voice of mighty Thun∣derings;</HI> Rev. XIX. 7. <HI>Let us be glad &amp; rejoyce, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His Wife has made herself ready.</HI> Then, then, twill be that our Saviour will <HI>present it unto Himself a Glorious Church,</HI> not having any thing that will
<PB N="10" REF="002040_0011_0FBA8561AA4359E8"/>
be distasteful unto Him▪ Then, then 'twill be, that our Saviour will call her <HI>Heph∣zibah</HI> and <HI>Beulah,</HI> because He will <HI>De∣light</HI> in His <HI>Church,</HI> and it shall be <HI>Mar∣ried</HI> unto Him: yea, <HI>as a Bridegroom re∣joyceth over the Bride, so shall thy God Rejoyce over thee.</HI></P>
<P>But as an <HI>Appendix,</HI> to this Contemp∣lation, it is to be added; That a <HI>parti∣cular Church,</HI> is also to be considered, as <HI>Married</HI> unto the SON of GOD. A <HI>par∣ticular Church,</HI> or a Company of whom our Saviour says, <HI>Gather my Saints toge∣ther unto me, those that have made a Cove∣nant with me by Sacrifice:</HI> Even to such a company combined in the Evangelical <HI>Church-State,</HI> our Saviour says, <HI>I Marry my self unto you.</HI> Of such a Church, He who gathered it, said, 2 Cor. XI. 2. I <HI>have espoused you to one Husband, that I may present you as a Chaste Virgin, to CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord; Remember thy <HI>Marriage</HI> unto thy Saviour. Do nothing to grieve Him; Do not Incur His Frowns; Do not provoke Him to withdraw from thee. Be faithful in His <HI>Covenant.</HI> Observe His <HI>Institutions,</HI> with a due
<PB N="11" REF="002040_0012_0FBA856326CE3C10"/>
Loyalty and Purity; preserve them from Violations. Be mindful of that Charge; Psal. XLV. 11. <HI>He is thy Lord, and Worship thou Him.</HI> Thy Title shall be, <HI>An Elect Lady;</HI> yea, Thou shalt be a <HI>Kings Daughter,</HI> if thou <HI>Hearken</HI> to such Ad∣monitions of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> To every <HI>Individual Person,</HI> coming into the <HI>Church of the Living GOD,</HI> and <HI>Laying hold on His Covenant,</HI> our SAVI∣OUR also says, <HI>I Marry my self unto thee.</HI> As it is in the Metaphor of a <HI>Temple.</HI> The <HI>Church</HI> in general is a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. And every <HI>Individual Believer</HI> is also a <HI>Living Temple;</HI> An <HI>Habitation of GOD thro' the Spirit.</HI> It is the same in the Metaphor of a <HI>Marriage.</HI> Our SAVI∣OUR does <HI>Marry</HI> Himself unto the <HI>Church</HI> in general. But He does also <HI>Marry</HI> Him∣self to every <HI>Individual Believer,</HI> and say to every Soul that receives Him as a SAVIOUR, what we have, Cant. IV. 8, 9. <HI>Come with me, my Spouse. Thou hast ra∣vished my Heart, my Sister, my Spouse.</HI> O Sollicited Soul, When thou comest into the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD, and heartily sayst, <HI>I am willing to be Listed among the People who look for Blessedness under the Conduct
<PB N="12" REF="002040_0013_0FBA856606A08498"/>
of the LORD, who is to break the Head of the Serpent;</HI> From this Moment thy SAVIOUR <HI>Marries</HI> Himself unto thee. When thou comest into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, and heartily sayst, <HI>I am willing that GOD manifest in the Flesh of my JESUS, may produce Good Terms with Heaven for me, and may fulfil in me all the Good Pleasure of His Goodness;</HI> From this Moment thy SAVIOUR <HI>Marries</HI> Himself unto thee. It may now be said, Isai. LIV. 5. <HI>Thy Maker is thy Husband.</HI></P>
<P>I am now directed and arrived unto the Management of the most Important Action, that it is possible for any among the Children of Men to be concerned in.</P>
<P>A Minister of the Gospel is called; Joh. III. 29. <HI>A Friend of the Bridegroom.</HI> The chief Scope, the main Work of our Ministry is, To <HI>Wooe,</HI> Oh! may we have the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Success,</HI> to <HI>Win,</HI> the Souls of our People, for an <HI>Espousal</HI> to our only SAVIOUR. The <HI>Motion</HI> is to be now made; And, O our Dear People. Despise it not, Reject it not, <HI>Neglect</HI> not <HI>so Great Salvation.</HI> Hearken to a <HI>Friend of the Bridegroom</HI> now arguing with you. <HI>Hearken to me, that GOD may hearken to
<PB N="13" REF="002040_0014_0FBA8566E6A8D1F0"/>
you</HI> another Day. Yea, <HI>Hearken, O Daugh∣ter,</HI> in a fair way to be made a <HI>Daughter of GOD,</HI> and <HI>Consider, and Incline thine Ear; Forget also</HI> the Amusements of a vain World, which have kept thee at a Distance from Him who is to be thy <HI>Lord,</HI> forever to be <HI>Adored.</HI> We read of a famous Transaction; The Steward comes, and, Gen. XXIV. 35, 49, 58. <HI>He said, The Lord hath blessed my Master greatly, and he is become great; and unto his son he hath given all that he hath:—And now, if ye will deal kindly and truly with my Master, Tell me.—And they called Re∣beckah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this Man? And she said, I will go.</HI> Let us now in like manner go on with our proceedings. I bring you this Ad∣vice; <Q>The Blessed GOD has a SON, unto whom He <HI>hath given all that He hath:</HI> He is <HI>Lord of all.</HI> It is now pro∣pounded unto Thee, O Poor Soul, whe∣ther thou art <HI>Willing</HI> to give thy self unto Him; <HI>Willing</HI> to have Him take Possession of thee; <HI>Willing</HI> that He should <HI>Supply</HI> thee, <HI>Instruct</HI> thee, <HI>Govern</HI> thee; &amp; render thee <HI>Fruitful</HI> unto GOD. And now, wilt thou treat thy SAVI∣OUR
<PB N="14" REF="002040_0015_0FBA856B4F3B1410"/>
well; or <HI>Deal kindly and truly</HI> with thy self? Say, <HI>Wilt thou go,</HI> and <HI>Live with</HI> thy SAVIOUR, and Live <HI>upon</HI> Him, and Live <HI>unto</HI> Him?</Q> Upon thy Hearty speaking of this One Word, <HI>I will go;</HI> or, <HI>I will be the Lords!</HI>—the Point is gain'd; and thy Triumphant Song may be that; Cant. II. 16. <HI>My Beloved is mine, and I am His.</HI></P>
<P>But there must be more particularity used, that we may have a distinct view of the <HI>Mystical Marriage,</HI> which is now <HI>Prosecuting;</HI> I hope, I may say, <HI>Celebra∣ting,</HI> and that you may come into it.</P>
<P>O Our Evangelized People, Your Great SAVIOUR does make to every Soul among you, the <HI>Proposal,</HI> O Gracious and Marvellous <HI>Proposal!</HI> of an <HI>Espousal</HI> un∣to Him. Your SAVIOUR is this Day fulfilling that Word; Hos. II. 16. <HI>At that Day, saith the Lord, thou shalt call me, Ishi;</HI> That is to say, <HI>My Husband.</HI> That ONE WORD heartily spoken, will assure you of His being so.</P>
<P>There is to be a <HI>Regular Proceedure</HI> in the <HI>Marriage.</HI> Wherefore,</P>
<P>First; There is the <HI>Fathers Consent</HI> in the Matter. GOD the FATHER has
<PB N="15" REF="002040_0016_0FBA856C938EC278"/>
given His <HI>Consent</HI> unto it, that Thy SA∣VIOUR should <HI>Marry</HI> Himself unto thee. It is a <HI>Match</HI> of the <HI>Fathers</HI> making. We read, Mat. XXII. 2. <HI>A King made a Mar∣riage for His Son.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Marriage</HI> of thy SAVIOUR, unto Thee, O thou Soul now under Invitations unto thy SAVI∣OUR. Of our SAVIOUR we find it said, <HI>Unto us a Son is given; His Name shall be called, Wonderful.</HI> GOD the <HI>Father</HI> has given His own <HI>Son,</HI> to be <HI>Married</HI> unto thee; A Thing that is <HI>Wonderful!</HI> He is Thy <HI>Father</HI> too; Tho' thou hast Re∣belled against Him; wandred from Him. Return, O Prodigal, Return unto thy <HI>Fa∣ther.</HI> Then does He also give thee unto thy SAVIOUR. Thou wilt be found One of those, of whom thy SAVIOUR says, Joh. XVII. 9. <HI>Those whom Thou hast given me.</HI> And that thou mayst be <HI>Mar∣ried</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR, 'tis a Thing which our <HI>Heavenly Father</HI> does <HI>devise means</HI> to bring it about. The GOD who retains the Right of a <HI>Father</HI> over thee, and has thee at His Disposal, does Coun∣tenance, Encourage, Command, thy <HI>Mar∣riage</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR. <HI>None come unto the Son, except the Father draw them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002040_0017_0FBA856DDBE94380"/>
Secondly, Thy SAVIOUR does <HI>Offer</HI> to be unto Thee, all that the <HI>Best Hus∣band</HI> in the World can be; All that can be expected from a SAVIOVR <HI>Espous'd</HI> unto thee. What thy SAVIOUR does in the <HI>Glorious Gospel of the Blessed GOD</HI> speak unto thee, is This; <HI>I would Marry my self unto thee.</HI> How amply 'tis Ex∣pressed! Hos. II. 19, 20. <HI>I will Espouse thee unto me for ever, yea, I will Espouse thee unto me, in Justice and in Judgment, and in Kindness, and in Mercies. I will even Espouse thee unto me in Faithfulness, and thou shalt know the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But wilt thou more Particularly pon∣der on the Heart-breaking Tenders of thy SAVIOUR, who is now <HI>Espousing</HI> of thee! Oh! Hearken to them; And at the very Moment when thy SAVIOUR Tenders Himself with His Blessings to thee, reply unto Him; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I Accept thee; Be thou unto me, such a SAVIOUR.</HI> The Thing admits of no De∣liberation.</P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it: <Q>Shall I make thee <HI>One with me;</HI> so much <HI>One</HI> with me, that in my <HI>Fulfilling of all Righteousness,</HI> and in my <HI>Rising from the
<PB N="17" REF="002040_0018_0FBA856F286BB3B8"/>
Dead,</HI> and in my <HI>Sitting in the Heavenly Places,</HI> and in my Receiving the <HI>Promises</HI> of GOD for the <HI>Righteous,</HI> Thou shalt be considered as <HI>with me</HI> in the doing of it.</Q> This is according to what we read of the Believer; Rom. XVI. 7. <HI>He is in CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it; <Q>Shall I bring thee to have <HI>my Father</HI> for <HI>thy Father?</HI></Q> This is according to what He speaks to the Believer; Joh. XX. 17. <HI>I ascend unto my Father and your Father.</HI></P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it; <Q>Shall I invest thee with my <HI>Unsearchable Riches?</HI> Bring thee to be a <HI>Joynt-Heir</HI> with me, and <HI>Inherit all things!</HI></Q> This is according to what He speaks to the Believer; Prov. VIII. 18. <HI>With me are durable Riches.</HI></P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it; <Q>Shall I <HI>Feed</HI> thee? Yea, <HI>Feast</HI> thee with <HI>Meat indeed,</HI> with <HI>Drink indeed;</HI> With the <HI>Food of Angels?</HI> This is according to what we read of the Believer;</Q> Rev. VII. 17. <HI>The Lamb shall feed them, &amp; shall lead them unto living fountains of Waters.</HI></P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it; <Q>Shall I <HI>Cloath</HI> thee with the <HI>Garments of Praise?</HI> Defend thee with a <HI>Durable Cloathing,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002040_0019_0FBA8570EA839F08"/>
and Adorn thee with a <HI>Covering of spangled Robes,</HI> which <HI>are inlaid with Golds</HI></Q> This is according to what we read of the Believer; Rev. XIX. 8. <HI>Granted, to be array'd in fine Linnen, clean &amp; white; the fine Linnen of the Righteousness of the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it; <Q>Shall I <HI>Instruct</HI> thee, <HI>Direct</HI> thee, <HI>Advise</HI> thee, and help thee always to <HI>know the Things of thy Peace?</HI></Q> This is according to what He speaks to the Believer; Psal. XXXII. 8. <HI>I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will guide thee with mine Eye.</HI></P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it; <Q>Shall I be a <HI>Shield</HI> unto thee, and shelter thee from every thing that may threaten to injure thee?</Q> This is according to what He speaks to the Believer; Zech. II. 8. <HI>He that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of mine Eye.</HI></P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it; <Q>Shall I <HI>dwell with</HI> thee, and make thee sensi∣ble that I am near unto thee; and by the influences of my Grace render thee <HI>Fruitful</HI> unto GOD; <HI>Zealous of Good Works,</HI> and <HI>Fruitful</HI> in them?</Q> This is according to what He speaks to the Belie∣ver;
<PB N="19" REF="002040_0020_0FBA857226431EC8"/>
Hos. XIV. 8. <HI>From me is thy fruit found.</HI></P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it; Shall <HI>I</HI> mul∣tiply the Expressions of my <HI>Love</HI> unto thee? <Q>Shall I give thee to find that I <HI>have meant unto Good,</HI> all that occurs in my Dispensations towards thee? Shall I <HI>Comfort</HI> thee under all thy Sor∣rows with speaking of those <HI>Good Words</HI> unto thee, which will gladden an <HI>Heart s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouping with heaviness?</HI></Q> This is accor∣ding to what He speaks to the Believer; Jer. XXXI. 3. <HI>I have loved thee with an Everlasting Love: Therefore with Loving kindness have I drawn thee.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; Thy SAVIOUR <HI>Offers</HI> it; <Q>Shall I bring thee into my <HI>Fathers House,</HI> and the <HI>King bring thee into His Chambers,</HI> and then fill thee with <HI>Joy Unspeakable and full of Glory,</HI> from wondrous, endless, inconceivable de∣monstrations of my <HI>Love</HI> unto thee; and shall I give thee to enjoy all the <HI>Spi∣ritual Blessings of the Heavenly Places?</HI></Q> This is according to what He speaks to the Believer; Joh. XIV. 2. <HI>In my Fathers House there are many Mansions. I go to prepare a Place for you.</HI></P>
<P>O most Heart-melting <HI>Proposal!</HI> How
<PB N="20" REF="002040_0021_0FBA8573A36E1568"/>
Vicious, How Obdurate must be the Heart, which will not hearken to it! The Heart which will not comply, like an <HI>Abigail,</HI> when an Espousal unto a <HI>Da∣vid</HI> was proposed unto her; <HI>Let me be Received among the Servants of my Lord!</HI></P>
<P>This brings on the Finishing Stroke.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Upon ONE WORD <HI>Hear∣tily spoken</HI> in Compliance with the <HI>Offers</HI> of thy SAVIOUR, the <HI>Best Husband</HI> in the World is become Thine; Thy <HI>Espousal</HI> to thy SAVIOUR, is become Unquestio∣nable. Thy SAVIOUR saying, <HI>I would Marry my self unto thee;</HI> Let thy Heart now speak that ONE WORD unto Him, <HI>Do it, O my SAVIOUR!</HI> 'Tis done imme∣diately. The <HI>Echo's</HI> of Devotion to the proffers of the <HI>Espousal,</HI> will settle the matter. We find such <HI>Echo's</HI> of Devo∣tion; in Psal. XXXVII. 8. <HI>Seek ye my Face: On hearing this my Heart did speak to thee; Thy Face, O Thou ETERNAL God, Thy Face now I will seek.</HI> Verily, GOD is not only <HI>Sought,</HI> but also <HI>Found,</HI> by an <HI>Heart</HI> making such an Answer as that ONE WORD unto the Demands of <HI>Piety.</HI> Thy SAVIOUR offering to be <HI>Thine,</HI> and to make Thee <HI>His Own,</HI> Let
<PB N="21" REF="002040_0022_0FBA8577D16CAD98"/>
thy <HI>Heart</HI> answer this ONE WORD unto Him, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Be Thou unto me all that thou dost offer to be:</HI> Thou hast now <HI>found</HI> Him, and art sure of Him.</P>
<P>That ONE WORD, the <HI>Hearty</HI> speak∣ing whereof, will <HI>Espouse</HI> thee to thy SAVIOUR, and secure thy Eternal hap∣piness; I will set before my Hearers the Dispositions which it is to be spoke withal.</P>
<P>And, First; Shall not thy Mind be struck and fill'd with Admiration at the <HI>Grace</HI> of thy SAVIOUR; That ever such an One should say, <HI>I would Marry my self unto thee!</HI> The Handmaid of the Lord said; Luk. I. 43. <HI>Whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come to me!</HI> But how much more mayst thou say, <HI>Whence is this to me, that my Lord and SAVIOUR should Espouse Himself to me!</HI> Who, Oh! Who is the LORD, that would <HI>Espouse</HI> Himself unto thee? A LORD, who is <HI>Lord of Lords,</HI> and <HI>Lord of all!</HI> The <HI>LORD of Hosts;</HI> and One who has <HI>All Power in Heaven and Earth given unto Him!</HI> A LORD, who is <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and the <HI>King of Glory!</HI> A LORD, who is <HI>Worshipped by all the
<PB N="22" REF="002040_0023_0FBA8579DDB3B2E0"/>
Angels,</HI> and who <HI>Humbles Himself to be∣hold the Things in the Heavens;</HI> What then, to <HI>Espouse</HI> Himself unto sorry things upon <HI>Earth?</HI> Yea, a LORD who is <HI>Equal with GOD,</HI> and very GOD; No less than the <HI>Being</HI> who is <HI>Over all, GOD Blessed forever.</HI> For such an One to say unto us, <HI>I would Marry my self unto thee!</HI> O Peerless Goodness! O Matchless Mercy! O Unparallel'd Condescension! But, then, who art Thou, O Despicable Crea∣ture, who art Thou, That ever this Glo∣rious LORD should <HI>Espouse</HI> thee unto Him? A sorry, silly, sinful Creature! For such a <HI>Monarch</HI> to <HI>Marry</HI> such a <HI>Beg∣gar;</HI> One so <HI>wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked!</HI> For One so Beautiful in all <HI>Perfections,</HI> to <HI>Marry</HI> one full of such loathsome <HI>Infirmities,</HI> and shocking <HI>Deformities!</HI> For Him to see thee cast out unto the <HI>Loathing of thy Person,</HI> and yet now be the <HI>Time of His Love</HI> unto thee! Oh! When and where can we find a Parallel! Soul, Admire the <HI>Grace</HI> of thy SAVIOUR. With the Transports of an Admiring Soul, Cry out, <HI>O my SA∣VIOUR, That ever Thou shouldest Espouse unto thy self, a foolish and a filthy Creature,
<PB N="23" REF="002040_0024_0FBA857B27A27430"/>
worthy of nothing but the utmost Abhorrence, and a Condemnation to a Devouring Fire, to Everlasting Burnings! I am amazed! I am amazed!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Tho' the Hearty speaking of ONE WORD, will <HI>Espouse</HI> thee to thy SAVIOUR, yet sensibly feel, yet sen∣sibly own, thy self unable to speak that <HI>One Word,</HI> until thy SAVIOUR shall please to enable thee. The <HI>Faith,</HI> by which we come into an <HI>Espousal</HI> to our SAVIOVR, has this very truly affirmed of it, <HI>It is the Gift of GOD.</HI> Soul, If thou wouldst have it <HI>given</HI> thee, the way is to count it so. Wouldst thou be <HI>Espoused</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR? Thy SAVIOUR must then hear that cry from thee, Cant. I. 4. <HI>O Do Thou draw me.</HI> In the Day when thy SAVIOUR does <HI>Espouse</HI> thee, He must also <HI>Quicken</HI> thee. Thou art lying <HI>Dead in Trespasses and Sins,</HI> putri∣fying in thy Sepulchre, when thy SA∣VIOUR says, <HI>I would Marry my self unto thee.</HI> Until He do Himself bring thee into the <HI>Life of GOD,</HI> and speak a <HI>Word of Life</HI> into thee, thou art not fit for His Embraces. What canst thou do till He <HI>Quicken</HI> thee? The first Effect of thy
<PB N="24" REF="002040_0025_0FBA857CE0CFB820"/>
<HI>Quickenning</HI> from Him, will be, thy being made willing to be <HI>Espoused</HI> unto Him. Such is thy Corruption, such is thy Ma∣lignity, such is the <HI>Enmity</HI> of thy <HI>Car∣nal Mind</HI> against thy SAVIOUR, &amp; such an <HI>Aversion</HI> hast thou for an <HI>Espousal</HI> unto Him, that tho' the speaking of ONE WORD would bring it about, yet thou wilt never speak it, until <HI>He</HI> bring thee to it, until He help thee to it. <HI>Lydia</HI> was not <HI>Espoused</HI> unto her SAVIOUR, until, <HI>The Lord opened the Heart of Ly∣dia.</HI> Prostrate in the Dust, cry from thence unto thy SAVIOUR; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, subdue my Will; give a New Heart unto me; Let it be a Day of thy Power with me, that shall make me willing to be Thine. I perish, I perish, if thou art not stronger than I, &amp; if thou do not prevail over me.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly. A Word of CONSENT unto the <HI>Espousal</HI> propounded by thy SAVI∣OUR; 'Tis the Hearty speaking of that ONE WORD, that is now waited for, now urged for. Of them, whom our SAVIOUR does <HI>Espouse</HI> unto Himself, there is this Account; Psal. CX. 3. They are <HI>a Willing People.</HI> Now ONE WORD that shall really declare thee to be One
<PB N="25" REF="002040_0026_0FBA857E2EF81410"/>
of that <HI>Willing People;</HI> upon the Propo∣sal of thy SAVIOUR, this ONE WORD, <HI>I am Willing;</HI> This will determine all. O Soul Wooed by thy SAVIOUR, Utter that ONE WORD, Luk. I. 38. <HI>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord; Be it unto me according to thy Word.</HI> That ONE WORD, will possess thee of the Best Thing that Heaven can give unto thee!</P>
<P>Thy SAVIOUR has designs of Good upon thee. ONE WORD giving the <HI>Consent</HI> of thy Soul, unto these Designs, does <HI>Espouse</HI> thee to Him. It was the Song; Isai. 26. 12. <HI>O Lord, Thou hast wrought all our Works in us, and for us.</HI> Thy SA∣VIOUR does propound; <HI>Shall I do in thee and for thee, all the works that must be done, to bring thee into Peace with GOD, and help thee to live unto Him?</HI> Heartily speak that ONE WORD, <HI>O my SAVI∣OUR, Do all thy Works about me!</HI> Thou art now <HI>Espous'd</HI> unto Him. Thy SA∣VIOUR is <HI>made Wisdom and Righteousness and Holiness, and Redemption,</HI> to those to whom He is <HI>Espoused.</HI> Heartily speak that ONE WORD; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Be Thou all of this unto me!</HI> Thou art now brought into the <HI>Espousal.</HI> Thy SAVI∣OUR
<PB N="26" REF="002040_0027_0FBA857FC3C20558"/>
<HI>prepares</HI> and <HI>strengthens to do the will</HI> of GOD, those to whom He is <HI>Espoused, working in them</HI> that which is <HI>well-pleasing in the sight of GOD.</HI> Heartily speak that ONE WORD, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Do thou for me all of this!</HI> Thou art now brought into the <HI>Espousal.</HI></P>
<P>But then thy <HI>Resignation</HI> of thy self unto thy SAVIOUR must accompany it. In ONE WORD <HI>Resign</HI> thy self unto Him: <HI>Resolve</HI> to be His; Engage to be <HI>For Him and not for another.</HI> Thy SAVI∣OUR, willing to be <HI>Thine,</HI> does also propound This; <HI>Art thou willing to be Mine?</HI> And now let that ONE WORD heartily come from thee; Psal. CXIX. 94. <HI>Lord, I am Thine, save me.</HI> The Point is gained. Yea, but in this Act of <HI>Resig∣nation</HI> there must and will be nothing less than thy very <HI>All</HI> included. <HI>Resign</HI> thy <HI>Spirit</HI> unto Him, and say, <HI>O my SA∣VIOUR, I desire that all the Faculties of my Soul may be filled with thee, and used for thee. Resign</HI> thy <HI>Body</HI> unto Him, and say, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I desire that my Earthly Tabernacle may be a Temple for thee, and all the Organs of it, the Instru∣ments of thy Righteousness. Resign</HI> to
<PB N="27" REF="002040_0028_0FBA8582AC192388"/>
Him all thy <HI>Possessions,</HI> all thy <HI>Capacities▪</HI> and say, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I desire that all my Talents may be ever imployed according to thy Direction, and for the service of thy Kingdom.</HI> All this is in that ONE WORD, <HI>Lord, I am Thine.</HI> But Remember, Thou art as well to <HI>Renounce</HI> as to <HI>Receive.</HI> Taking thy SAVIOUR for thy <HI>Espoused</HI> Lord, all other Lords and Lovers are to be shaken off: All <HI>Creatures</HI> to be aban∣doned. No more must any <HI>Creatures</HI> be to thee, what is to be found in a Glori∣ous CHRIST alone: And the Tempta∣tions of <HI>Satan</HI> must be no longer hear∣kened unto. Thy Soul must now say, <HI>Lord, Other Lords, even the Flesh, &amp; the World, and the Devil, have had a dominion over me; But now Thou only shalt be my Lord and my God.</HI> Thy Language must be that; Hos. XIV. 8. <HI>What have I any more to do with Idols?.</HI> This ONE WORD has tied the Indissoluble <HI>Knot.</HI> Thou art without any more ado <HI>Espoused</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>Finally; Thy SAVIOUR makes His Demand upon thee, Prov. XXIII. 26. <HI>Give me thy Heart.</HI> Speak now that ONE WORD, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I Give my Heart
<PB N="28" REF="002040_0029_0FBA8584304A0B98"/>
unto thee.</HI> Upon this ONE WORD, there will come <HI>the Great Voice out of the Tem∣ple of Heaven from the Throne,</HI> like that which is to come on another occasion, <HI>Saying, It is done! It is done!</HI> Thou art the Soul, of which I may say, <HI>Rejoyce over her, O ye Heavens, for the Good that is done unto her.</HI> Thou art the Soul, to which there is heard that Word from the Heavens, <HI>Arise, and shine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is risen upon thee!</HI></P>
<P>There was once a <HI>Marriage</HI> proposed, wherein the Person concerned, had it said of him, Ruth. III. 18. <HI>The man will not be at rest, until he have finished the thing this Day.</HI> The <HI>Mystical Marriage</HI> now proposed should have such a <HI>Dispatch</HI> given to it. Oh! <HI>Be not at Rest,</HI> but on this very <HI>Day</HI> let the <HI>Thing be Finished.</HI> Here, Here, if ever, <HI>Happy is the Wooing that is not long a doing!</HI> To forward the matter, Oh! that these EXPOSTULA∣TIONS may have their Efficacy!</P>
<P><HI>Expost. I.</HI> The SAVIOUR who so kindly stoups as to say, <HI>I Marry my self unto you;</HI> Is He not a SAVIOUR infinitely worthy to be Adored and Embraced! Infinitely
<PB N="29" REF="002040_0030_0FBA85881E83B0F8"/>
worthy to be with a Soul full of Loves, &amp; Wonders, and Praises, accepted of? What can there be <HI>Desirable</HI> in any Person, which you cannot see in the Glorious Person, that now does be speak your <HI>Espousal</HI> to Him? Is He not <HI>Fairer than the Children of Men;</HI> Yea, <HI>Altogether Lovely!</HI> Are there not <HI>all Treasures of Wisdom &amp; Knowledge in Him?</HI> Is He not <HI>the Heir of all Things?</HI> Can any thing be so <HI>Good</HI> as this <HI>Lamb of GOD!</HI> Oh! <HI>How Great is His Goodness, and how Great is His Beauty!</HI> Is He not a <HI>Great Kings, whose Name is Venerable?</HI> Is He not <HI>gone into Heaven, where He is on the Right Hand of GOD, Angels being made subject unto Him!</HI> And is there any <HI>Number of His Armies?</HI> Is He not the SON of GOD; and the <HI>Creator</HI> whom an <HI>Eternal Power and Godhead</HI> must be ascribed unto? Has He not with a Condescension forever to be marvelled a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> already <HI>Married</HI> Himself un∣to our Nature? <HI>Verily He took not on Him the Nature of Angels;</HI> But He has taken our <HI>Nature,</HI> when He took the Man JESUS, to be <HI>One Person</HI> with Himself. And Oh! the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve</HI> by which He has <HI>Commended</HI> Him∣self unto us, in that <HI>while we were Sinners He has died for us!</HI> Ah! Perishing Soul;
<PB N="30" REF="002040_0031_0FBA858A311B7110"/>
Has thy SAVIOUR so <HI>Loved thee,</HI> as to <HI>Give Himself</HI> for thee; And wilt thou not so <HI>Love Him,</HI> as to <HI>Give Thy self</HI> to Him? Has the <HI>Love</HI> of thy SAVIOUR to Thee been <HI>Strong as Death;</HI> made Him willing to <HI>Dye</HI> for thee? And hast thou not so much <HI>Love</HI> to Him, as will make thee wil∣ling to Live with Him? How, How canst thou Resist the Overtures that such a Glo∣rious Lord makes for thy <HI>Espousal</HI> to Him!</P>
<P><HI>Expost. II.</HI> Will it not be a <HI>Joy</HI> unto the Heart of your SAVIOUR, to see you <HI>Es∣poused</HI> unto Him? Of <HI>Solomon</HI> we read, Cant. III. 11. <HI>He was Crowned,</HI> (A <HI>Crown</HI> on the Head of the <HI>Bridegroom,</HI> was of Old one of the Matrimonial Ceremonies,) <HI>in the Day of his Espousals, &amp; in the Day of the Gladness of his Heart.</HI> Soul, May this be the <HI>Day</HI> of thy <HI>Espousal</HI> to thy SAVIOUR, 'twil be the <HI>Day of the Gladness of His Heart.</HI> Oh! The <HI>Satisfaction</HI> with which thy SA∣VIOUR will say upon it! <HI>Now do I see the Travail of my Soul, and what my Blood has purchased! Now do I see another added unto the Children of GOD, &amp; unto the Num∣ber of them that shall be saved! Now is my Father Glorified, &amp; I have one Object more for me to do Good unto; the Good in the doing
<PB N="31" REF="002040_0032_0FBA858BB86005A8"/>
whereof my Delight is Infinite!</HI> And now, will not thy <HI>Heart</HI> have a Share in the <HI>Gladness!</HI> Oh! Give thy self unto thy SAVIOUR, <HI>This Hour! This Hour!</HI> 'Twill be the <HI>Best Hour</HI> that ever thou saw! The Hour, that will bring thee into a State, that will see a Succession of none but Good Things for Eternal Ages.</P>
<P><HI>Expost. III.</HI> Can you Comprehend the <HI>Blessedness,</HI> which your <HI>Espousal,</HI> to your SAVIOUR will bring you to? No; 'Tis Incomprehensible. O Soul <HI>Espoused</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR, How <HI>Enriched</HI> art thou in the Enjoyment of a SAVIOUR, who <HI>Lives for ever,</HI> and <HI>Whose Dominion is an Everlasting Dominion,</HI> and who <HI>does ac∣cording to His Will, in the Army of Hea∣ven, &amp; among the Inhabitants of the Earth!</HI> A SAVIOUR to whom are due those Doxologies; <HI>Thine, O Lord, is the Greatness, and the Power, &amp; the Glory; For all that is in Heaven, &amp; in the Earth, is Thine: Both Ri∣ches &amp; Honour come of thee, &amp; thou Reign∣est over all!</HI> Art thou not now <HI>Espoused</HI> unto a SAVIOUR, with whom thou wilt have that <HI>Portion;</HI> 2 Pet. I. 4. <HI>Exceeding Great &amp; Precious Promises?</HI> 'Tis a SAVI∣OUR who will be a <HI>Sun</HI> &amp; <HI>Shield</HI> for
<PB N="32" REF="002040_0033_0FBA858D42146CC8"/>
those that are <HI>Espoused</HI> unto Him; will <HI>give Grace,</HI> and <HI>give Glory</HI> to them, and <HI>withhold no Good Thing</HI> from those to whom He has <HI>Espoused</HI> Himself. If the LORD Himself be Thine, what need of any more to fix thee in the most assured, the most Finished Blessedness? An <HI>All suffi∣cient</HI> GOD is He, whom thou art <HI>Espous'd</HI> unto: And thou mayst sing at that rate; <HI>The LORD is my Portion; I have a goodly Heritage!</HI> Truly, Thou art <HI>Espous'd</HI> unto a SAVIOUR, who is <HI>Able</HI> to Do for thee, <HI>far beyond all that thou canst Ask or Think.</HI> But having <HI>Espoused</HI> Himself unto thee, will He not be as <HI>Willing</HI> as He is <HI>Able</HI> to do for thee! Oh! What will He do for thee! What will He do! All Words are swallowed up. What He will do? 'Tis <HI>Unutterable!</HI> 'Tis <HI>Unutterable!</HI> Oh! What <HI>Marvellous Loving Kindness</HI> will He show thee, in the <HI>Strong City</HI> that He will bring thee to!</P>
<P><HI>Expost. IV.</HI> Upon your <HI>Espousal</HI> to your SAVIOUR, what Exultations, what Ac∣clamations will there be among the <HI>An∣gels</HI> of GOD? If it be as we read, Luk. XV. 10. <HI>There is Joy in the presence of the Angels of GOD, over one Sinner that Re∣penteth:</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="002040_0034_0FBA858EB0712750"/>
Be sure, the <HI>Espousal</HI> of a Soul unto GOD, must produce a <HI>Joy among His Angels.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Repenting Sinner,</HI> that is <HI>Espoused</HI> by our SAVIOUR. The <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD are <HI>Spectators</HI> of what is done for the <HI>Espousal</HI> of a Soul unto their Lord; and the <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the Transaction that is carried on. O Soul <HI>Espoused</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR, Thou art a <HI>Spectacle to Angels.</HI> And, Oh! What a Gladsome <HI>Spectacle!</HI> Upon the view of thy Closure with thy SAVIOUR, the <HI>Morning-Stars</HI> will <HI>sing together,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Sons of GOD</HI> will <HI>shout for Joy.</HI> An <HI>Epithalamium</HI> will be heard among them, of that Importance, <HI>Glory to GOD in the Highest; for the Good Will now passing between Him, &amp; the Children of Men!</HI></P>
<P>And, O Thou <HI>Spouse</HI> of the Almighty KING, How ready will the bright <HI>Angels</HI> be, to act in <HI>Ministrations</HI> for such an <HI>Heir of Salvation!</HI> Always on the <HI>Wing</HI> to do thee Good Offices! With what Alacrity will they attend thee, Befriend thee, <HI>Carry thee in both Hands like tender Nurses,</HI> and be thy <HI>Guardians?</HI> Will such a <HI>Thought</HI> as this, do nothing with thee? How much wilt thou then deserve to be a <HI>Prey</HI> to <HI>Devils?</HI> Yea, Thou shalt become a <HI>Prey</HI>

to the <HI>Terrible</HI> Ones; a <HI>Lawful Captive</HI> to them.</P>
<P><HI>Expost. V.</HI> Is there no <HI>Danger</HI> in the <HI>Delay</HI> of such a Matter, as your <HI>Espousal</HI> to your SAVIOUR? Your SAVIOUR does insist upon a speedy Answer, a present Ans∣wer; He is upon those Terms with you; Heb. III. 7. <HI>To Day if ye will hear His Voice.</HI> O Soul under the Invitations of a SAVI∣OUR; 'Tis insisted on, Wilt thou NOW, this very Day, come into an <HI>Espousal</HI> to thy SAVIOUR? Yea, Dost thou at this Moment, I say, <HI>At this Moment!</HI> Give thy self up unto thy SAVIOUR, and say, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Take Possession of me!</HI> Cer∣tainly, There is nothing more Uncertain to thee, than the <HI>Time of thy Departure</HI> out of this World. Thou mayst say, <HI>I know not the Day of my Death.</HI> But if the <HI>Dark Day</HI> come upon thee, before thou art <HI>Es∣poused</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR, how forlorn, how undone art thou! How canst thou escape those <HI>Hands,</HI> which it will be a <HI>fearful thing</HI> to fall into? Or, suppose thou mayst yet have <HI>Goods laid up</HI> here for <HI>many Years;</HI> To put off a Compliance with a SAVIOUR, who does <HI>Beseech</HI> thee to be <HI>Espoused</HI> unto Him, and be <HI>Recon∣ciled
<PB N="35" REF="002040_0036_0FBA8591A96945C8"/>
unto GOD,</HI> will not this <HI>Dilatory</HI> tri∣fling in a Thing of such Concernment, <HI>Grieve</HI> and <HI>Vex</HI> His <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> &amp; provoke Him to <HI>Depart</HI> from you? But, Oh! <HI>Wo unto them, if I depart from them,</HI> saith the Lord! There will be nothing done to purpose, in thy <HI>Espousal</HI> to thy SAVIOUR; but thou wilt be Damn'd unto Eternal Blindness and Hardness; and go on under a <HI>Spirit of Slumber,</HI> unto a <HI>Damnation that Slumbers not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Expost. VI.</HI> If you will not give a Right and a Fit Answer to the Motion which your SAVIOUR makes of your <HI>Espousal</HI> to Him, I Pray, think on some Answer to an <HI>Awful Question,</HI> with which I am now to come upon you; An <HI>Awful Question,</HI> which indeed all the Angels in Heaven can give no Answer to! Tis that <HI>Awful Question,</HI> Heb. II. 3. <HI>How shall we escape, if we neglect so Great Salvation?</HI> I must say unto you; <HI>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh.</HI> For, if you <HI>Refuse</HI> an <HI>Espousal</HI> unto a SAVIOUR, who does now sollicit for it, what can you expect, when He shall be <HI>Revealed from Heaven, with His mighty Angels, in Flaming Fire, to take Ven∣geance on them that obey not His Gospel?</HI>

Yea, <HI>If you Refuse and Rebel, you shall be devoured,</HI> by that <HI>Fiery Indignation</HI> of GOD which is to <HI>Devour</HI> His <HI>Adversaries;</HI> The <HI>Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it</HI> For you to think on the inexpressible <HI>Glories,</HI> whereto our SAVIOUR will then ad∣vance those whom He has <HI>Espoused</HI> unto Himself; and feel your selves banished into intollerable Torments, with the <HI>De∣vils</HI> to whom you would now rather give your selves than to your SAVIOUR: But then to think, <HI>My seasonable speaking of ONE WORD would have saved me from all of this!</HI> Oh! The Regret, Oh! The Re∣morse, Oh! the Unsufferable Anguish, that your <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsaken Souls</HI> must be thrown into! Oh! Think; <HI>What shall I do, when the SAVIOUR whom I now refuse, riseth up and cometh down, and when the GOD whose Visits of Love I now refuse, does Visit in His Wrath, What shall I answer Him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Expost. VII.</HI> O Our YOUNG PEOPLE, Can it be <HI>Too soon,</HI> for you to come into an <HI>Espousal</HI> unto our SAVIOUR? <HI>Too soon</HI> for you to become United unto Him, who sends this Message unto you, <HI>I Love them that Love me, &amp; they that seek me Early shall find me?</HI> Our SAVIOUR said unto
<PB N="37" REF="002040_0038_0FBA859A1C635D50"/>
some; Jer. II. 2. <HI>I remember thee, the kind∣ness of thy Youth, the Love of thine Espou∣sals.</HI> Oh! That our YOUNG PEOPLE may be prevailed withal, in their <HI>Youth,</HI> to have a <HI>Kindness</HI> for their SAVIOUR, and be drawn by His <HI>Love</HI> into an <HI>Espou∣sal</HI> unto Him! Child, Thy SAVIOUR puts it unto thee; <HI>Art thou willing to be mine?</HI> Reply to Him, <HI>Lord, I am Thine! O make me willing to be Thine!</HI> Thy SA∣VIOUR will say upon it, <HI>O my Dove, I hear thy Voice, &amp; sweet is thy Voice unto me!</HI></P>
<P>A very Prudent Constitution once made in the Low Countries, <HI>That none should be Married, until they could recite all the Answers in the Catechism used in the Chur∣ches there,</HI> produced as <HI>Well-Catechized</HI> a People as ever was in the World. Oh! How well would it be for Thousands of Souls, if they would order it for Them∣selves, <HI>Never to Marry any one until they are first Espoused unto their SAVIOUR!</HI></P>
<P>Such of you as are not yet <HI>Married</HI> un∣to a Neighbour; yea, Such of you as are not of the Age for <HI>Marriage;</HI> How <HI>Wise∣ly,</HI> How <HI>Jus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly,</HI> How <HI>Reasonably</HI> would it be done of you, to take up this Purpose; <HI>I will be first Married unto my SAVIOUR,
<PB N="38" REF="002040_0039_0FBA859B6CF73330"/>
before I will allow any other Marriage to be talked of!</HI> It may be, if you so <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught first the Kingdom of GOD,</HI> you might have <HI>Other Things added</HI> unto you, in better Circum∣stances. This then is the Demand with which I come unto you; Jer. 3. 4. <HI>Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, Thou art the Guide of my Youth?</HI> In becom∣ing thy <HI>Husband,</HI> O Soul, He becomes the <HI>Guide of thy Youth.</HI> With a Consenting Soul, <HI>Now</HI> Oh! make Him so!</P>
<P>I have done.</P>
<P>And now, a Soul come into an <HI>Espousal</HI> with a Lovely SAVIOUR, most certainly will above all things desire &amp; study to <HI>Please</HI> Him. O Soul <HI>Espoused</HI> unto the SON of GOD, By this Mark, Thou shalt know that thou art so; <HI>Know that thou art passed from Death to Life.</HI> There will nothing in this World so powerfully deter thee from every thing that the Light of GOD in thee shall condemn as an <HI>Evil thing,</HI> as this, <HI>My SAVIOUR will be offended at it!</HI> Nothing will be unto thee such a powerful incentive &amp; perswasive to <HI>Patient continuance in all well-doing,</HI> as this, <HI>My SAVIOUR will be gratify'd with it!</HI></P>
<P>Yea, The <HI>Espousal</HI> will oblige thee, to
<PB N="39" REF="002040_0040_0FBA859CF29904A8"/>
press after the most <HI>Consummate Union</HI> with thy SAVIOUR, and thou wilt never be at ease in thy mind, until thou art entirely ONE with thy SAVIOUR; ONE in <HI>Will,</HI> ONE in <HI>Aim,</HI> ONE in <HI>Interest;</HI> un∣til thou feel the <HI>Blood</HI> of thy SAVIOUR warming thee into a Resemblance of His <HI>Holiness in all manner of Conversation,</HI> and running warm in thy Veins; until thy SAVIOUR become <HI>All in All unto thee,</HI> and thou being <HI>Dead with Him,</HI> and unto every thing but <HI>Him,</HI> HE ONLY shall be thy <HI>Life;</HI> the <HI>Strength of thy Heart, and thy P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtion for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! May such Glorious Attainments, be more aspir'd unto!</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">

<P>BUT it will be a very proper Thing to make an <HI>Improvement</HI> of the ESPOUSAL between our SAVIOUR and His People, for the <HI>Direction</HI> of Persons in the <HI>Mar∣ried State,</HI> what should be their <HI>Carriage towards one another</HI> in it.</P>
<P>When the Gracious ENDS for which the <HI>Married State</HI> is Instituted, have c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me into an Enumeration, the Servants of GOD have demanded a Room for this; <HI>To be
<PB N="40" REF="002040_0041_0FBA859E92ECCD88"/>
a Lively Exhibition of the Union between our SAVIOUR and His People.</HI> It is im∣possible for <HI>Married Persons,</HI> more com∣pendiously and more effectually to con∣sult their own Welfare, &amp; make their <HI>Yoke</HI> easy &amp; pleasant unto them, than by per∣petual endeavours to Exhibit what passes between a Glorious CHRIST, &amp; the <HI>Church,</HI> whereof He says, <HI>I Marry my self unto it.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed, the Crime of <HI>Adultery [I have seen an Horrible Thing,</HI> saith the Lord!] has in this thing a very singular Aggra∣vation. As it is the blackest and vilest <HI>Injustice</HI> that can be committed, and a most Flagrant <HI>Perjury</HI> violating a most solemn <HI>Oath</HI> of GOD; So it is an abomi∣nable Breach upon that Conformity to the <HI>Union</HI> between our SAVIOUR and His People, where of <HI>Marriage</HI> is Ordained for an Exhibition. <HI>Shall not I visit for such Things, saith the Lord, &amp; shall not my Soul he avenged on the Married, who do such Things?</HI> Indeed, tho' some Countries make it <HI>Capital,</HI> yet for the most part, <HI>An Evil &amp; Adulterous Generation</HI> so prevails, that the Crime rarely meets with any due Punishment among the Children of Men, But GOD will not let this <HI>wickedness</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="002040_0042_0FBA85A3E34B0CA8"/>
of them who forget the <HI>Hand joyned in Hand, go unpunished.</HI> 'Tis marvellous to see, how <HI>Adultery</HI> is punished by the more immediate Providence of a Holy and a Righteous GOD, who of all the secret Wickedness, <HI>I know it, &amp; am a Witness of it, saith the Lord!</HI> The Criminals are pursued in their <HI>Estate. A Fire,</HI> one can scarce imagine, <HI>How,</HI> does <HI>Consume their Increase.</HI> They are followed with one strange <HI>Impoverishment</HI> after another upon them. They are punished in their <HI>Offspring.</HI> The <HI>Hope</HI> of their Family is cut off by praemature Mortality; or Lives to <HI>consume their Eyes &amp; grieve their Hearts.</HI> They are punished, with a <HI>wounding disho∣nour</HI> on their Name, &amp; a <HI>Reproach</HI> that is <HI>never to be wiped away.</HI> Into what a <HI>Bed of Tribulation,</HI> does the LORD, who says of such Things, <HI>I hate them!</HI> by'nd by throw these Malefactors! Their <HI>Hearts</HI> are first prodigiously <HI>Hardened;</HI> but afterwards they fall into <HI>Terrors</HI> of GOD. Anon, with &amp; from the <HI>Impure Flames</HI> that were ever glowing in them here, they go down to <HI>Eternal Burnings.</HI> Behold the Justice of Heaven in all of this. The Affront given to a Glorious CHRIST, in the Crime, is
<PB N="42" REF="002040_0043_0FBA85A5621A2DC8"/>
enough to procure all of this; <HI>Great Plagues and of long continuance.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Principal Direction</HI> for a Good Car∣riage in the <HI>Married State</HI> is that; Eph. V. 24, 25. <HI>As the Church is subject unto CHRIST, so let Wives be unto their own Husbands, in every Thing. Husbands, Love your Wives even as CHRIST also has loved the Church.</HI> I do not stay upon the Obser∣vation, That the Duty of the <HI>Wife</HI> is here, as elsewhere prescribed before that of the <HI>Husband;</HI> Because there may be more of <HI>Difficulty</HI> in <HI>Her</HI> Duty than in <HI>His;</HI> And, Because His cheerful doing of <HI>His</HI> Duty, will very much depend upon Her doing of <HI>Hers.</HI> But this I observe; The most <HI>Comprehensive prescription</HI> that can be given, for the Duties of the <HI>Married State,</HI> is in this One Word; <HI>Conform to what passes between the Blessed JESUS, &amp; His Espoused People.</HI> Of <HI>Enoch</HI> we read, <HI>He walked with GOD, and he begat Sons and Daughters.</HI> The <HI>Married,</HI> who continually Think, <HI>What passes between my SAVIOUR, and the Church, which having Loved as His own He Loves unto the End?</HI>—These <HI>Walk with GOD</HI> in their <HI>Marriage,</HI> and thro their <HI>Pilgrimage.</HI> Here, Here is an
<PB N="43" REF="002040_0044_0FBA85A710BA0350"/>
admirable sense of <HI>Marrying in the Lord;</HI> Even to <HI>Marry</HI> with an Eye unto what passes between the LORD, &amp; His <HI>Beloved;</HI> and Regulate the whole Conduct of the <HI>Married Life,</HI> with an Imitation of it. And where is the <HI>Wit,</HI> that can soar high enough, <HI>Ad Enarrandam Faelicitatem hu∣jus Matrimonii;</HI> to tell, what an <HI>Happy Pair</HI> it is that is <HI>United</HI> in such a <HI>Marriage!</HI></P>
<P>Many Counsils have been given, and should be taken for a good Carriage in the <HI>Married State;</HI> but this is the chief of them all, and they are all most curi∣ously <HI>Summ'd</HI> up in this, and the <HI>Work is cut short in Righteousness</HI> with it. My Friends, <HI>Consider how your SAVIOUR treats His Church; consider how the Church treats her SAVIOUR; and Conform unto it; Oh! Treat one another accordingly.</HI></P>
<P>Having left with you this ONE <HI>Admo∣nition of the Lord,</HI> I need say no more; It will be enough if I consign the work of applying it, over to another Preacher, which is always attending upon you. CONSCIENCE hearken'd unto, will do the rest. CONSCIENCE, Do thine Office.</P>
<P>Let the HUSBAND often consider; <Q>How does my SAVIOUR <HI>Love</HI> His <HI>Church,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="002040_0045_0FBA85A825249350"/>
and Receive it, and Value it, as the pre∣cious Gift of His Father to Him!</Q></P>
<Q><P>With what a <HI>Favourable Eye</HI> doth my SAVIOUR Look on His <HI>Church,</HI> &amp; what a <HI>Fellowship</HI> with Him does He bring her to!</P>
<P>What <HI>Gifts</HI> does my SAVIOUR pre∣sent His <HI>Church</HI> withal; Above all <HI>Giv∣ing Himself</HI> unto her!</P>
<P>Is not He always <HI>Doing something</HI> or other to Testify His <HI>Love</HI> unto her? Yea, what is there that He is not willing to <HI>Do</HI> for her? He has even <HI>Dy'd</HI> for her.</P>
<P>How <HI>kindly</HI> does my SAVIOUR speak unto His <HI>Church! Good words, Comforta∣ble words!</HI></P>
<P>How careful is my SAVIOUR, to provide for His <HI>Church,</HI> all that may be needful and useful for her!</P>
<P>How full of Compassion is my SAVI∣OUR to His <HI>Church,</HI> in all the Distresses that come upon her!</P>
<P>How notably does my SAVIOUR ap∣pear to <HI>plead the cause</HI> of His <HI>Church,</HI> when Harms are like to be done unto her!</P>
<P>What means does my SAVIOUR use for His <HI>Church,</HI> that she may have the <HI>knowledge</HI> which may be for her Advan∣tage, and her Ornament?</P>
<P>If my SAVIOUR see any Thing in His
<PB N="45" REF="002040_0046_0FBA85A9A6B024F0"/>
<HI>Church,</HI> that it were to be wish'd were otherwise, how <HI>wisely,</HI> how <HI>kindly</HI> with what <HI>Suitable Remedies</HI> does He pursue the Healing of it? And how does His <HI>Love cover a multitude of Sins?</HI></P>
<P>Above all, How much does my SAVI∣OUR make it His Concern, that His <HI>Church</HI> may be full of God; <HI>Filled with all the Fulness of God?</HI></P></Q>
<P>Now, go do likewise.</P>
<P>Let the WIFE often consider.</P>
<Q><P>How does the CHURCH <HI>Love</HI> her SAVIOUR! None in all the World so dear unto her!</P>
<P>How lothe is the CHURCH to <HI>Be</HI> or to <HI>Do</HI> any thing that may be <HI>grievous,</HI> to her SAVIOUR? How griev'd if any thing in her have been so?</P>
<P>But, Oh! the <HI>Pleasure</HI> that she takes in every thing that gratifies Him!</P>
<P>How ready is the CHURCH, to com∣ply with the will of her SAVIOUR? <HI>De∣lighting to do thy will, O God!</HI></P>
<P>What <HI>Contentment</HI> has the CHURCH, with whatever <HI>Condition</HI> her SAVI∣OUR does order for her?</P>
<P>How tender is the CHURCH of what belongs unto her SAVIOUR? what her tenderness for all that He sets a value on!</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002040_0047_0FBA85AD60DADF98"/>
In-fine; If the CHURCH has enter∣tained any <HI>Jealousie,</HI> about the <HI>Love</HI> that her SAVIOUR bears unto her, &amp; said, <HI>My God has forgotten me;</HI> how ready is she anon to see her error in it!</P></Q>
<P>Now go do likewise.</P>
<P>A <HI>Marriage</HI> carried on, with such a Regard unto the <HI>Second Adam</HI> in it; what a Rare Course is herein taken, to abate, and prevent, much of the <HI>Curse,</HI> which every <HI>Marriage</HI> in <HI>this World,</HI> is likely to be more or less Encumbred &amp; Embittered withal! What a Rare Course is taken, that instead of cause to have it said, <HI>It is Good that a Man should not touch a Marriage,</HI> it shall still hold Good, <HI>It is not Good for Man to be alone!</HI></P>
<P>What a rare course is taken that the <HI>Marriage</HI> may have all the Gracious Ends of it answered! Yea, What <HI>Mira∣cles</HI> will be wrought in and for a <HI>Mar∣riage</HI> which thus has the presence of our JESUS at it! By such PIETY, My Friends, you will also prepare your selves for that <HI>Higher State</HI> in which <HI>they Marry not, nor are given in Marriage, but are Equal to the Angels of GOD.</HI></P>
