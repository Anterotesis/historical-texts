<P>THE CONCERTS in which <HI>Mrs. POWNALL</HI> has taken a part during the late Winter, having established her in the First Rank, as a <HI>Vocal Per∣former,</HI> must have excited in the Public Mind, a desire to peruse the productions of her Pen, some of which she has at different times selected for their Entertainment; and however inferior these may appear, when divested of the Ornaments derived from her <HI>Melody,</HI> the editor flatters himself, that the Public, who have already given a decided and unqualified Preference to her Execution, will find no reason to be dissatisfied with the Judgment dis∣played in her Choice of the following, from among a variety of SONGS of her own Composition, when at an early period of Life.—Few circumstances could have occur'd more advantageous to our cha∣racter for justness of <HI>Taste,</HI> than the earnest appro∣bation bestowed on this <HI>Lady</HI> at a time, when it was not generally known, that she had during a
<PB N="4" REF="026032_0003_0FCF36583AD4D250"/>
series of years, been the <HI>Favorite Singer at Vauxhall.</HI> For although her Benevolence of Conduct, respect∣ing the <HI>French Performers,</HI> may in the eyes of <HI>Phi∣ladelphians</HI> have given additional <HI>Grace</HI> to her ex∣ertions at their Concerts, yet the applauses bestow∣ed on her <HI>Performance,</HI> by a very crouded and re∣spectable audience, when for her own <HI>Benefit,</HI> shew a just appreciation of <HI>Merit,</HI> even when unaided by Circumstances, adapted to silence the voice of Criticism and excite the Feelings of <HI>Philanthrophy.</HI></P>

<P>'TWAS said of QUEEN MARY, when she died, and was Anatomiz'd, the Word <HI>Calais</HI> was found en∣graved on her <HI>Heart.</HI>—I will not vouch for the truth of that assertion; but I should do injustice to my present Feelings, was I not to declare, the exertions made for this evening in my Favor, stamp such an indelible impression, that, <HI>Die when I may,</HI> the Names of GRATITUDE and PHILADELPHIA will be found on <HI>Mine.</HI></P>

<L>You're not expos'd to <HI>"feel what wretches feel."</HI></L>
<L>Though modest shame forbids them tell their tale,</L>
<L>Though o'er their poverty she draws the veil;</L>
<L>Yet did I paint the sorrows of <HI>those few,</HI></L>
<L>With pity's tear t'wou'd many a cheek bedew.—</L>
<L>But hold, methinks I hear some standers by</L>

<L>'Tis true; the strong rebuke is well apply'd,</L>
<L>I feel its force, and give them leave to chide.</L>
<L>If Ladies you'll forgive this faint endeavor</L>
<L>To introduce the BAND HERE, to your favor.</L>
<L>Assure yourselves I wou'd not give offence,</L>
<L>When Beauty smiles, all feel its influence.</L>
<L>What say you Sirs;—but put it to the vote,</L>
<L>You can't see <HI>Genius</HI> in a thread-bare coat.</L>

<L>I freely own it puzzles me to tell,</L>

<L>But jokes apart, I fear some here may be,</L>
<L>That think, to write is arrogance in me.</L>
<L>And more, that I for Foreigners shou'd plead.</L>
<L>Let such remember, t'as been long agreed,</L>
<L>Who pleases all must have a task indeed.</L>
<L>While others, who well know that good was mean't,</L>
<L>Though they condemn the lines, applaud the intent.</L>

<HEAD>SONG VI. <HI>The Tear that bedews.—Mr. HARPER.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THO' Bachus may boast of his care killing bowl,</L>
<L>And folly in thought drowning revels delight;</L>
<L>Such worship alas hath no charms for the soul,</L>
<L>When softer devotions the sences invite;</L>
<L>To the arrow of fate or the canker of care,</L>
<L>His potions oblivious a balm may bestow,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="026032_0026_0FCFD4FCE5D01978"/>But to fancy that feeds on the charms of the fair,</L>
<L>The death of reflection's the birth of all woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What soul that's possest of a dream so divine,</L>
<L>With riot would bid the sweet vision begone</L>
<L>For the tear that bedews Sensibility's shrine,</L>
<L>Is a drop of more worth than all Bachus's tun.</L>
<L>The tender excess which enamours the heart,</L>
<L>To few is imparted, to millions deny'd,</L>
<L>'Tis the brain of the victim that tempers the dart,</L>
<L>And fools jest at that for which Sages have dy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each change and excess hath thro' life been my doom,</L>
<L>And well can I speak of its joy and its strife;</L>
<L>The bottle affords us a glimpse thro' the gloom,</L>
<L>But Love's the true sun-shine that gladdens our life.</L>
<L>Come then rosy Venus and spread o'er my sight,</L>
<L>The magic illusions that ravish the soul,</L>
<L>Awake in my breast the soft dream of delight,</L>
<L>And drop from thy myrtle one leaf in my bowl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then deep will I drink of the nectar divine,</L>
<L>Nor e'er jolly God, from thy banquet remove,</L>
<L>But each tube of my heart ever thirst for the wine,</L>
<L>That's mellow'd by Friendship and sweeten'd by love.</L>

<HEAD>SONG VII. KISS ME NOW OR NEVER.—Mrs. MORKIS.</HEAD>

<L>THE morn was fair the month was May</L>
