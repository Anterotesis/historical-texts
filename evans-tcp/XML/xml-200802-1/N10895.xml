</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WAR is deservedly accounted a very great judgment; as such it is threat∣ned in the sacred scriptures, and such es∣teemed by those who have had sorrow∣ful experience of its ravages. <HI>Every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and gar∣ments rolled in blood</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Isaiah ix.5.</NOTE>: Wherever it takes its rout it leaves a <HI>crimson tract</HI> behind it, oc∣casions the deepest distress, and spreads des∣truction round; whilst to compleat the dole∣ful tragedy, <HI>famine</HI> and <HI>pestilence</HI> often times follow in its train. Persons of refined humanity cannot even contemplate it at a distance without the most painful emotions. With the compassionate prophet they are ready to cry out, <HI>my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me, I cannot hold my peace, be∣cause
<PB N="4" REF="013789_0003_0F91AED06A74D5E0"/>
thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah iv 19.</NOTE>. The idea is shocking, the heart revolts at the prospect, and none but the <HI>savage</HI> and <HI>inhuman</HI> can consider its tragical effects without horror: But though this be true, yet it frequently rages, its rumours are heard in different parts of the world, and perhaps there is no time when peace is at once enjoyed by all the inhabitants of the earth. It is melan∣choly to reflect, that whilst "devils with de∣vils damned firm concord hold," men, who are under every possible engagement to cul∣tivate peace and love, should suffer their breasts to be agitated by passions so malig∣nant as to excite such obstinate disputes as cannot be decided, but by the sword, and terminate in all the horrors of war. Still more to be lamented is it, that they, who far from disturbing others, desire only to sit under their own vine and fig-tree, enjoying the sweets of industry, friendship and liber∣ty, should be molested by the <HI>ambitious</HI> and <HI>tyrannical,</HI> and forced to fly to arms in sup∣port of their inherent rights and privileges: But such is the depraved state of human nature, that instances like <HI>this</HI> are not un∣common: <HI>Wars and fightings proceed from men's lusts, which war in their members,</HI> and are greatly prevalent since the apostacy. The love of empire, the principles of am∣bition,
<PB N="5" REF="013789_0004_0F91AED138F1E950"/>
avarice and revenge, being deeply radicated in the human heart, have convert∣ed this earth, which otherwise would have been the peaceful retreat of innocence, into an horrid scene of offensive wars, and a field of blood: The united considerations of reason and religion have never been suf∣ficiently powerful to restrain these lusts of men, and keep them from invading the persons, liberties and possessions of their neighbours. Hence it becomes necessary for the <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>quiet,</HI> the <HI>meek</HI> and <HI>in∣offensive</HI> to turn their attention to the art of war; and while they breathe the pacific spirit of the gospel, to furnish themselves with the instruments of slaughter: This is requisite in order to their preserving them∣selves and property, from the hands of vio∣lence. In this view therefore, war though connected with blood and carnage, is legi∣timated. The principles of self-preservation prove it lawful; the voice of reason pro∣claims it expedient, and the law of God demands it as a duty; whilst a most tre∣mendous <HI>curse is denounced against such as do this work of the Lord deceitfully, and keep back their swords from blood</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xlviii.10.</NOTE>. Were we certain of being always safe from the violent and unreasonable assaults of others, it would by no means be expedient for us to spend any part of our time for the acquisi∣tion
<PB N="6" REF="013789_0005_0F91AED69E6CA2A0"/>
of military skill; for the religion of Jesus, the laws of God, do not permit us to invade the rights of others, or disturb them in the quiet enjoyment of their justly ac∣quired possessions. But, inasmuch as the present corrupt temper of mankind can give us no reasonable prospect of an entire ex∣emption from their violence, and as the most probable way to prevent the execution of their wicked designs, is to appeal to the sword, and be in a capacity to repress their insolence, and repel force by force; hence knowledge in the arts and policy of war, is a very desirable accomplishment: And truly happy is the condition of that people, who are so prepared for the reception of an ap∣proaching enemy, as to be free from pre∣vailing fears on the occasion, and have well grounded confidence of success in battle. This was the happy condition of <HI>David</HI> in my text: On what occasion he penned the Psalm is uncertain: Some think, when he was persecuted by <HI>Saul</HI>; others, when he was forced to fly from <HI>Absalom</HI>; and others again, on the occasion of his being deliver∣ed from the hands of <HI>Ishbibenob,</HI> one of the sons of a Giant, who came upon him and thought to have killed him, and probably would have done so, had not Abishai stepped in to his relief <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2d Saml. xxi.16.</NOTE>: But be the occasion what it would, we find it speaks the language of
<PB N="7" REF="013789_0006_0F91AED79FE5C198"/>
confidence, and a full assurance of victory in war, should it ever rise against him. This was not a groundless presumption, nor the effect of pride and self-conceit; it was not an enthusiastic impression, nor an evidence of a rash and fool-hardy spirit; but the result of past experience: His knowledge and dexterity in the use of arms, his own bra∣very and prowess, the goodness of his cause and the favour of heaven towards him, fill∣ed him with these hopes. The words then may well furnish out to us the foundation of an enquiry concerning the things that are requisite to inspire a people with cou∣rage, and reasonable hopes of success in an engagement with an host that either has, or may encamp against them. You will give your candid attention then, whilst I go on to enumerate those things that are necessa∣ry for this purpose.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> The justice of their cause is, in this view essential: They who are believers in the righteous, superintending providence of God, must needs have but very slender hopes of prevailing in battle, if they know them∣selves to be engaged in the support of an unrighteous claim: If the increasing their own power and dominion, the aggrandize∣ment of themselves and families, and the gratification of the passions of avarice, am∣bition or revenge, be the only motives of
<PB N="8" REF="013789_0007_0F91AED7EA140C88"/>
their commencing hostilities, and the only objects they are pursuing in opposition to the peace and happiness, the liberty and vir∣tue of those whom they invade; then, me∣thinks, their own hearts must misgive them; and they can reasonably expect no favour, no countenance, no support from that up∣right Governor of the world who loveth righteousness, and is particularly concerned for the happiness of his great family of mankind: Should they flatter themselves with hopes of success from their superior numbers, or greater acquaintance with mi∣litary discipline, yet they cannot fail to re∣flect, that God is able to arm the elements and the whole host of heaven against them, to impart wisdom to the simple, knowledge to the ignorant, strength to the weak, and courage to the faint-hearted; and thus to cause victory to declare in favour of op∣pressed innocence. <HI>This,</HI> the most authen∣tic history in the world teaches us he has done in time past, and <HI>this</HI> such unrighteous oppressors have reason to fear he may do again; if in a natural way, deliverance cannot be procured for those who are stand∣ing up in defence of their own righteous cause: The invaders therefore of the rights of their fellow-men must necessarily have many fore bodings of ill-success, and just fears of being repulsed, even when engaged
<PB N="9" REF="013789_0008_0F91AED8B56BBC48"/>
in contest with a people less in number and inferior in skill to themselves: Whereas on the other hand, the goodness of a people's cause not only gives hope that God will fa∣vor and succeed them in it; <HI>that the Cap∣tain of the Lord's host will be for them,</HI> and <HI>fight their battles,</HI> but also inspires them with great zeal and resolution in the defence of it. What confidence must that people have of protection and victory, when the interest of religion, the honor of God, the happiness of themselves, and the welfare of unborn millions, are the only object of their contention? And what an amazing unbro∣ken courage, what an invincible heroism, will possess the breasts of those who fight <HI>pro aris et focis,</HI> for their religion, their wives and children, their liberty and happi∣ness, in short, for every thing that is good and great, venerable and sacred. <HI>This</HI> will give spirit to the lifeless, courage to the ti∣mid, invention to the dull, and ardour to the phlegmatic. In such a cause as this, per∣sons of all ages and professions will chear∣fully engage. The husband-man <HI>will beat his plough-share into swords, and the vine-dresser his pruning-hook into spears, and the weak,</HI> forgetting his natural embicility, <HI>will say I am strong</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Joel ii.10.</NOTE>. In fine, as the poet has finely observed:
<Q><PB N="10" REF="013789_0009_0F91AED96DA201C0"/>
<L>—"They have great odds</L>
<L>Against the astonish'd sons of violence,</L>
<L>Who fight with awful justice on their side."</L></Q></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> A suitable body of troops to stand up in defence of this good cause is another thing necessary. On the goodness of their cause a wise people will not alone rely, though God can deliver, and has done so, without any visible means, yet his usual me∣thod is to effect his purposes by the instru∣mentality of second causes: Therefore to neglect the natural means of safety, whilst we have them in our power, is not confid∣ing <HI>in,</HI> but rashly tempting and boldly pre∣suming <HI>on</HI> the power and goodness of God. He expects that we use all lawful methods in our own power for our security and de∣fence; after which we may leave our righ∣teous cause with heaven, in humble hope that he will uphold and protect it. Now to have provided a suitable body of militia to withstand the host that encampeth against us, is one of those methods which we ought to take for our security: And that this mi∣litary body may be such as to give a people reasonable prospect of victory, it should be circumstanced in the following manner: <HI>It should consist of a respectable number of able-bodied, effective men</HI>: Though one some∣times chases a thousand, and two puts ten thousand to flight, yet this must be
<PB N="11" REF="013789_0010_0F91AEDB3ADC9698"/>
owing to the miraculous interposition of Pro∣vidence, and what happens besides the com∣mon and ordinary course of things:—For a large and very numerous army I would not be understood to plead; because such an one commonly rather disserves than helps the cause; rather gives occasion to fear a defeat, than hope for victory: All past experience confirms the truth of this: It is the unvaried language both of sacred and profane history, that overgrown armies have commonly been routed, thrown into confu∣sion and cut to pieces, by those of a more moderate size, who were therefore more easily governed and less unweildy. <HI>Abijah</HI> King of <HI>Judah</HI> with an army of four hun∣dred thousand men entered the field with <HI>Jereboam</HI> King of <HI>Israel,</HI> with twice that number, and yet the former was victorious, slaying five hundred thousand of the latter in one btttle <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">2d Chron. xiii.3, 17.</NOTE>. <HI>Asa</HI> King of Judah, having an army of five hundred and eighty thou∣sand men, entirely routed an army of a mil∣lion, brought against him by <HI>Zerah</HI> King of <HI>Cush</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">2d Chron. xiv.9.13.</NOTE>. So the immense army of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> consisting of between two and three millions was entirely defeated by forty thousand <HI>Greeks.</HI> But though these instances prove that no advantage is to be expected from an over numerous host; yet at the present day when it is not usual to carry such su∣pernumerary
<PB N="12" REF="013789_0011_0F91AEDBB7135998"/>
troops into the field, it is best to equal, or at least not to fall much short of those against whom we appear▪ It is of still greater importance towards insuring success, that the troops should be valiant and courageous, able of body, and capable of enduring the fatigues of a campaign. And notwithstanding the advantage a <HI>stand∣ing army</HI> may, on some account, have over a <HI>militia,</HI> yet these <HI>latter</HI> may, with more security be depended on than the <HI>former</HI>; because being composed of men who have had their sinews strung, their limbs invigor∣ated, and bodies hardened by daily labor, they will commonly exceed the former in strength and courage; and fighting for their estates, families and religion, will have every possible inducement to exert the most strenuous efforts in their defence.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>this militia should be well equipt with martial weapons, with proper arms, and sufficient ammunition.</HI>—Destitute of these, no resistance can be made, nor at∣chievement performed against the advancing foe. <HI>These</HI> are as necessary to the proper soldier to enable him to withstand a well furnished host, as the panoply of God is to the spiritual soldier, who without it cannot expect <HI>to stand against the wiles of the de∣vil, or quench his fiery darts. David</HI> could not have uttered himself as he does in the
<PB N="13" REF="013789_0012_0F91AEDC6E0F3E98"/>
text, unless he knew that <HI>he</HI> and his <HI>subjects</HI> were well provided with weapons of war: For what probability of success can there possibly be in an engagement, if to all the modern instruments of death, we have no∣thing to oppose but our naked bodies, or useless arms, as incapable of annoying as they. Conscious of the disadvantage arising from the want of military weapons, the <HI>Philistines took away all the smiths, through∣out the land of Israel,</HI> lest the <HI>Hebrews should make themselves swords or spears,</HI> and thus be in a posture of defence; and at another time, <HI>when there was not a sword, or spear to be found among forty thousand in Israel,</HI> they fell an easy prey into the hands of their enemies. Further, <HI>they should be possessed of military skill</HI>;—knowledge in the art of war among civilized nations has been much cultivated, and by some of them carried to perfection: To go therefore into the field, in order to face a veteran, well disciplined soldiery, rude and ignorant of this science, is the direct way to sacrifice our lives and betray the cause in which we are engaged. More has often times been done by military skill, than by the advantage of superior numbers and prowess. In battle with bar∣barous forces, this is an accomplishment not so essential. But with those by whom war is studied as a science, and held as a profes∣sion,
<PB N="14" REF="013789_0013_0F91AEDD7274A040"/>
it is in vain to engage, unless we also are well versed in the modern manoeuvres of the same. They that are but superfici∣ally acquainted with history, know that the most glorious exploits have been atchieved by means of martial discipline. By this, in a great measure, the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> sol∣diers made their arms triumphant over the barbarous nations of the globe. This, par∣ticularly, extended the Roman Empire to the most diffusive limits, enabled her to give law to millions, and made her the mistress of the world. This acquired to <HI>Julius Cae∣sar</HI> the false glory of having slain more than twelve hundred thousand men in his wars: For had he been destitute of this skill, he could not have made such mighty ha∣vock; the strength and courage, the pa∣tience and valour of his troops frequently meeting an equal match from the nations with whom they contended. To un∣derstand the use of the gun, the sword and the bayonet; to know how to draw up an army in the most advantageous form for battle, to be expert in the different evolutions, so as to be able to rally a broken squadron; to place a battallion in an ad∣vantageous post, to detach a party to sup∣ply the place of those that may have been outdone, and to reinforce such as are mani∣festly too weak to stand the shock that is
<PB N="15" REF="013789_0014_0F91AEDDEDF4D4E0"/>
brought against them; to know how to perform these several manoeuvres readily, without mistake or blunder, will give to an army a very great advantage in a field en∣gagement, and without this knowledge our confidence in them can be but small. Lastly, <HI>they should be accustomed to military subor∣dination.</HI> To have able Generals, prudent and experienced commanders, and then im∣plicity to obey them, is the beauty and per∣fection, the life and safety of an army. Of this obedience and subordination the regu∣lar troops are an excellent example. It is surprising to observe to what a pitch they have carried their ideas of order, through the influence of severe discipline, and long continued custom. The common soldiers are all obedience to those in command. And amongst the officers themselves there is a just gradation, each inferior one strictly observing the orders of those above him. Every one is fixed in his post, and yields submission to those that are in places of su∣perior command. Hence the supreme offi∣cer regulates the whole. He, like the soul in the natural body, puts in motion every member; and all the different parts, which otherwise would clash and interfere, depend∣ing ultimately on his influence, are made one harmonious body, all tending in their respective places to one grand point, with∣out
<PB N="16" REF="013789_0015_0F91AEDEC4046D58"/>
confusion. Whereas, if there were many masters in an army, all possessed of co-ordinate power, this would obstruct each salutary plan, and breed destruction to the whole. From a consideration hereof, it has ever been esteemed an important point to maintain this subordination; and for the maintenance of it no discipline has been thought too severe. Of such moment did the ancient warlike <HI>Romans</HI> view it, that we have instances of persons being punished with death for fighting contrary to order, even though success attended their arms. This indeed was a punishment disproportion∣ate to the offence: However, all must con∣cede that without the preservation of <HI>go∣vernment</HI> and <HI>order</HI> in an army no success is to be expected against those who religiously uphold it. I come now to observe,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That the righteousness of a people's character is another thing necessary in order to their being confident of success in war. It is evident that under the righteous go∣vernment of Jehovah, those who have ap∣peared in defence of a just cause, have some∣times been defeated. People have been de∣prived both of civil and religious liberty by the prevailing efforts of an oppressive enemy; and this has been permitted to take place by God as a punishment for their dis∣obedience, ingratitude and unfruitfulness.
<PB N="17" REF="013789_0016_0F91AEDF74502A88"/>
As he sometimes <HI>turns a fruitful land into barreness for the wickedness of those that dwell therein</HI>; so at others, he raises up enemies to come and <HI>spy out a nation's li∣berty</HI> and strip them of it, because they have abused it to purposes of licentiousness, or are otherways wholly unworthy of the same. For the abuse of the written and preached word of God, people have had their <HI>teach∣ers removed into corners, and a famine of hearing the word has ensued.</HI> Thus, be∣cause the Jews neglected and despised the gospel, our Saviour threatens, <HI>that the king∣dom of God should be taken from them, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</HI> Just so it is with regard to any other important blessing: If people are not sensible of its worth; if they despise and undervalue, pervert and abuse it; are un∣grateful to the donor of it, and their whole conduct discovers that they are unworthy the possession thereof; then it pleases hea∣ven to take it from them that they may see its worth in its absence, and may be brought to humble themselves before God for their impieties and numerous provoca∣tions. Accordingly, because the Jews had communion with the neighbouring nations with whom they partook in their idolatries, he permitted them from time to time to be conquered and made tributary to them, and
<PB N="18" REF="013789_0017_0F91AEE025903600"/>
to continue in this distressed condition, till they were brought to a sense of their sins, and repenting of them, called upon him for delive∣rance; wherupon he raised them up saviors, and restored them to their wonted privileges. Now in consideration of these things, a people can have no well grounded confidence of success in war, notwithstanding the justice of their cause, and a respectable body of troops to defend it, unless their own cha∣racter be righteous and good; especially if they have abused great favors, and not lived according to their advantages, nor an∣swered in any measure, the righteous ex∣pectations of heaven concerning them. This righteous character is necessary, not only for the people in general, but especially for those on whom they depend to protect them. If they who are immediately engaged in the war, are persons of vicious behaviour, impi∣ous, profane, unjust, intemperate and de∣bauched, we cannot with confidence rely on their efforts, neither can they face an ene∣my with calmness and intrepidity. This character like the accursed thing in the ar∣my of Israel, will trouble the camp, pro∣voke God to withdraw his assistance, and bring <HI>wrath</HI> upon the whole people. No∣thing great is like to be effected by a disso∣lute soldiery. Guilt is always timerous; vice enervates the mind, unstrings the body, and unsits for dangerous enterprises. True
<PB N="19" REF="013789_0018_0F91AEE0F7702768"/>
magnanimity dwells not in the breasts of impenitent sinners; but conscious innocence makes men fearless and undaunted. The wise man observed long ago, <HI>that the wick∣ed fleeth when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><L>"True conscious virtue is to know no sin,</L>
<L>"He's armed without, that's innocent within."</L></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They who have, through Christ, obtained an interest in the divine favour, and made God their friend; they who have inlisted under <HI>Jesus, the Captain of their salvation, and have fought the good fight of faith,</HI> may be fearless even amidst the most shocking scenes of blood and carnage. <HI>If thousands fall around them, and ten thousands at their right hands,</HI> they may remain unmoved, and meet death with calmness in its most dread∣ful forms. Whereas, on the other had, an absolute certainty of victory is by no means sufficient to make a wicked man intrepid in fight; for though the battle may be won, yet his life is in danger of being lost; the consideration of which, must needs excite prevailing fears, and consequently unsit him, in a degree, for real service.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> If people entering into war would have well grounded hopes of success, they must not trust in an arm of flesh, in their numbers, or in their skill or courage; but in the Lord, committing their cause to him,
<PB N="20" REF="013789_0019_0F91AEE2EE8A7590"/>
and depending on his power and wisdom for prosperity This has been the practice of the pious in all past ages. In the 44th Psalm we find the church thus expressing herself: <HI>Through thee will we push down our enemies; through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us: For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me, but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance.</HI> When a people have made provision to re∣pel force by force, and are persuaded of the goodness of their cause and character, then they are properly prepared to confide in the <HI>Lord of hosts and God of armies,</HI> and to look to him for his blessing in so hazard∣ous an undertaking, the event of which de∣pends wholly on his Providence. A people should acknowledge God in all their ways, but especially it is their interest and duty thus to do, when their <HI>all</HI> lays at stake; when life, liberty and property are depend∣ing. They who neglect to do this, con∣fiding in their own numbers, prudence and valour, are guilty of a grand omission that may prove fatal to their cause. The lan∣guage of such conduct is, either that God's Providence is not concerned in the events of war, or that they stand in no need of his in∣terposition and assistance; whereas common observation teaches us that he is particular∣ly
<PB N="21" REF="013789_0020_0F91AEE325A2FE98"/>
concerned in deciding the fate of battles. Things do not always, nay, not frequently turn out according to natural probabilites. How often have armies been defeated in a very wonderful manner, contrary to all hu∣man appearances or expectations. <HI>The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but time and chance happens to them all. Should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,</HI> this would be most manifestly owing to the special inter∣position of the Divine Being on the weak∣er, or against the stronger side. And in∣deed, in victories obtained in a more natu∣ral way, the agency of heaven is concerned, and his superintendency to be acknowledg∣ed; for he is the author of all the warlike accomplishments that soldiers possess: They have nothing but what they received from him, and to him are they indebted for their valour and military skill. Hence David ac∣knowledges that <HI>God taught his hands to war and his fingers to fight.</HI> Now the way to secure the divine assistance and protection in battle, is to trust in him. <HI>They that trust in the Lord, shall be like mount Zion, which cannot be moved. There is no King saved by the multitude of an host; a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. An horse is a vain thing for safety, neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. But
<PB N="22" REF="013789_0021_0F91AEE44EC6B318"/>
whoso trusteth in the Lord shall be safe.</HI> It was this favour and protection of God, which he had secured by trusting in him, that made David so confident of success in war: <HI>The Lord,</HI> says he, <HI>is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear, the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?</HI> In this way did King <HI>Asa</HI> and King <HI>Jehosaphat</HI> ob∣tain signal victories over hosts much supe∣rior in number to theirs: In thier distress they cried unto the Lord, and he did deli∣ver them. The words of <HI>Asa</HI> are these, <HI>Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whe∣ther with many, or with them that have no power; help us, O Lord, for we rest on thee, and in thy name go against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God, let not man pre∣vail against thee.</HI> And <HI>Jehosaphat</HI> addres∣ses himself to heaven in the following man∣ner: <HI>Behold how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. O our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might a∣gainst this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are up unto thee.</HI> In consequence of their thus looking to God, and humbly de∣pending on him for assistance, they both came off victorious; for none that <HI>trust in the Lord shall be ashamed, but cursed is man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> What has been said, may serve as a caution to all people not to engage in a war that is manifestly unjust. Every one is so that is entered upon with a view to de∣prive a nation or society of men of their just rights and privileges; to dispossess them of their property and possessions; and to bring them into a state unfriendly to virtue, re∣ligion and happiness. It is highly danger∣ous and criminal to take up arms in such a cause as this. Dangerous, as such persons put themselves out of the protection of hea∣ven, and can hope for no assistance from <HI>the God of armies</HI>; but on the contrary, have reason to think that he will be against them, frown upon all their enterprizes, disconcert their measures, and cause the <HI>mischiefs they have framed for others, to fall upon their own heads.</HI> Besides, they have reason to ex∣pect the most vigorous opposition from those whom they attempt to oppress: Cri∣minal, because should they prove successful, they are chargeable with the guilt of mur∣der, in the sight of heaven, for every per∣son that is slain by them in the defence of their just rights and liberties. If the cause of the war be just, every person that is des∣troyed when standing up in opposition to it, is righteously slain, and <HI>his blood will be re∣quired at his own hands</HI>; but if it be other∣wise,
<PB N="24" REF="013789_0023_0F91AEE6AF915E40"/>
they that are slain, will hereafter <HI>rise in judgment against</HI> their destroyers, and will <HI>condemn them:</HI> Whereas, if on the con∣trary, they themselves should fall in battle, being killed in the support of an unrighte∣ous claim, they will be in danger <HI>of going down to hell with their weapons of war</HI><NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxii.27.</NOTE>. It is sincerely to be wished, that at the pre∣sent day, when ambition and avarice are so frequently the only motives for fighting, this matter were properly considered by all. Then, methinks, we should not have our ears so often saluted by the unwelcome sounds occasioned by the clashing of swords, the report of cannon, and other instruments of death. Under the prevailing influence of this persuasion <HI>swords would be beat into plough-shares, and spears into pruning-hooks, nation would no more rise against nation, neither would they learn war any more. Eve∣ry one would sit under his own vine and fig-tree, having none to make him afraid.</HI> But, as there is no prospect of this at present; <HI>as wars will not cease to the ends of the earth,</HI> till the lusts and corruptions of men are to a greater degree subdued; and as, impelled by these sordid passions, one state will be perpetually seeking to subjugate and enslave another, therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>ly.</HI> It becomes every people to put and keep themselves in a posture to defend their
<PB N="25" REF="013789_0024_0F91AEE6E206AD98"/>
liberties from the depredations of their fel∣low-men. They cannot expect long to en∣joy the inherent rights of humanity, unless in a capacity to resist the forceable attempts of others against them. <HI>To stand fast in their liberties</HI> is the duty of every body of men, and the way to do this is to be unit∣ed among themselves, to preserve a virtu∣ous character, to keep up a just sense of the importance of their privileges, and to ac∣quire the arts and instruments of war. So much depends on the military character of a people, that they cannot rationally de∣pend on the preservation of their rights and possessions without it. When they sit careless and secure, neglecting the necessary means of defence; when no provision is made by them to resist the incroachments of their ambitious and aspiring neighbours; when a martial spirit flags, and the know∣ledge of arms remains uncultivated, then, like <HI>Laish</HI> of old, they may be easily plun∣dered and subdued, and indeed it is highly probable they will be so. In observations like these the people of this country are par∣ticularly concerned. Though we now enjoy peace, we cannot reasonably flatter our∣selves that this important blessing will al∣ways be continued. Our privileges, pos∣sessions and conveniences of life are too considerable to escape the eye of envy. Eu∣ropean

nations notice our circumstances, and doubtless covet them. In years past the power of Great-Britain has protected us from the invasions of foreign states.— But, alas! the time is already come, when it is not safe wholly to depend on her: For she who was the nurse of our infancy, the guardian of our youth, and he boast of our riper years, has now become the inva∣dor of our liberties. An attack from that <HI>power</HI> to which we have been used hereto∣fore to look up for protection, seems now most immediately to threaten us. So that, it should seem, the period had already com∣menced, when of our privileges we must be deprived, or stand ready to defend them with our own swords. Unhappy is the dispute, which under the government of God has commenced between Great-Britain and these colonies, and encreasing from year to year, has at length arrived to a most alarming crisis. Had we submitted to the unreasonable claims of parliament, and con∣sented to have been slaves, we might then have been delivered from the present gloomy prospects of war. But though we all pro∣fess allegiance to Britan's King, and have ever discovered ourselves as loyal subjects as any in his dominions; yet so just an idea have we of the importance of our rights, that we seem resolved to defend them at
<PB N="27" REF="013789_0026_0F91AEEA57552118"/>
the risque of every thing dear, and never, by a tame submission, entail misery on our∣selves and posterity. This opposition, on our part, has fired the resentment of the <HI>ministry</HI> at home, who seem equally deter∣mined to support their own measures, if possible; and hence, at present, al<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things threaten the horrors of a civil w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. We know, and are fully persuaded that our cause is good, that justice is o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our side, that liberty, religion and happiness are at stake; and therefore that we should be wanting to ourselves, our children and our country, not to endeavour to defend it. And, from this persuasion, are now vigor∣ously making hostile preparations to with∣stand the designs of those who may attempt to enforce the late unconstitutional acts of the British parliament. But, should we be called to battle, what prospect have we of success? Are the conditions to be found with us, that were mentioned in the forego∣ing discourse, as necessary to give confi∣dence of victory? It is to be feared they are not. What shall then be said unto you? Shall you be exhorted to submit to the late pretentions of parliament, acknowledge its authority to legislate for you, and be tame∣ly obedient to its oppressive edicts? God forbid! You are rather to be exhorted, by repentance and reformation, to make
<PB N="28" REF="013789_0027_0F91AEEAAC6DFE30"/>
your character as good as your cause, and piously trusting the event with God, recur to the <HI>ultima ratio,</HI> the sword. Though not prepared, perhaps, at present <HI>to meet the enemy in the gate,</HI> yet we shall be high∣ly culpable if this be long the case with us. If in contest we fail of success, it will be ei∣ther through the viciousness of our charac∣ter, or our deficiency in military skill.</P>
<P>These impediments may be removed, and that I may be instrumental thereof, I would now most earnestly recommend it to this whole people, seriously to consider, that the difficulties under which we labour, and of which we loudly complain, were suf∣fered to fall upon us for our sins. <HI>Our own wickedness has corrected us, and backslidings reproved us that we might know and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that we have forsaken the Lord our God.</HI> In vain do we send the most powerful and skilful troops against our enemies, whilst we re∣main impenitent and disobedient; whilst intemperance and debauchery, pride and oppression, luxury and extravagance, im∣piety and profaneness abound among us; for these will inevitably turn the edge of their swords, and procure them a defeat, because we cannot rationally hope the con∣tinuance of our liberties, unless we are wor∣thy, and prepared to make a good improve∣ment
<PB N="29" REF="013789_0028_0F91AEEB64ACB7B8"/>
of them. Suffer me therefore by every thing that is excellent and desir∣able on the one hand; by the sweets of peace and security, by the blessings of liber∣ty, good government and order, and by the joy of future salvation; also, on the other, by every thing that is dreadful; by the horrors of war; by the flowing blood of your fellow-countrymen; by the miseries of slavery and oppression, and by the still greater infelicities of future damna∣tion: By these hopes and fears, suffer me, with all the plainness of a friend, to conjure you, to <HI>break off your sins by right∣eousness, and your iniquities by turning to the Lord.</HI> Mourn your abuse of privileges, neglect of opportunities and breach of co∣venant; lament all those impieties and re∣bellions which have been so provoking to the Lord, and have caused him to bring us into our present truly distressed circum∣stances. Reform also all your extravagan∣cies, and mortify your pride; renounce fo∣reign superfluities, and live contentedly, <HI>in compliance with the recommendation of the Continental Congress,</HI> on the produce of your own bleating flocks and fertile fields. Such conduct as this, both in a religious and political view, will greatly subserve the interest of our cause, and tend to deliver us from one of the most terrible of all worldly
<PB N="30" REF="013789_0029_0F91AEED582050B8"/>
evils, a civil war. But should it fail of this desired end, yet being thus reformed, we may then with greater confidence make the last appeal. Well disciplined troops fight∣ing for such a penitent people, and in so good a cause as ours, may be almost cer∣tain of victory. But have we a prospect of such? Is it likely, from present appearan∣ces, that <HI>this</HI> and the neighbouring colonies will be able to furnish out an army suffici∣ently qualified to look regular troops in the face? I answer; in our numbers, we shall be in no degree deficient, and the courage of American forces was never justly disput∣ed; they have given as exemplary proofs of it as any people under the sun. The air we breathe, and the climate we live in, tend to make us hardy and bold, persevering and patient. No difficulties can discourage, no dangers terrify the valorous sons of New-England, tempered in these northern climes, and braced by these frigid north-westerly blasts. But what shall we think of their skill? It is readily confessed, that this in years past, has not, in general, been great. But at present, a spirit of emulation, and an ardent desire to excel herein, is excited in the midst of us. Our present prospects of danger have put us upon this important study, which in times of supposed safety we unwisely neglected. In our different towns
<PB N="31" REF="013789_0030_0F91AEEDA37197D8"/>
and colonies, what time is spent, what cost bestowed, and pains taken in the acquisiti∣on of this necessary science? Military com∣panies formed, officers chosen, and prepa∣rations hastily making for an approaching enemy! From specimens already given, we have the most animating assurances, that in the revolution of a few months, if we per∣severe, we shall have a most respectable mi∣litia; qualified to do eminent service for their distressed and insulted country. Re∣joiced are we to find that the same love of freedom, and thirst of martial skill, which so generally prevail through the provinces, have manifested themselves in this place, and been exhibited in a manner that does us honor; for while, on the one hand, we have run into no excesses, been concerned in no disorders, nor offered any abuse to those, who in some things think differently from us; on the other, being prompted by this noble spirit, we have been quietly pur∣suing those steps that have been calculated to procure a redress of grievances, and in particular made considerable advances in the knowledge of the art military.</P>
<P>This naturally leads me to address myself to you, gentlemen of the militia, by whom the science of arms has been cultivated, and at whose desire we are now in the house of God. You are not the first instance of sol∣diers
<PB N="32" REF="013789_0031_0F91AEEE94A44D40"/>
asking wisdom from heaven, and en∣quiring their duty from the ministers of re∣ligion. To John the Baptist, men of this character applied, saying, <HI>what shall we do?</HI> He replies, <HI>Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages.</HI> This is the duty of all soldiers, at all times, and under all circumstances; but not the whole of it. Yours under the pre∣sent circumstances and prospects, I have generally hinted at already. You will suf∣fer me now to be more particular, and say, that as you have voluntarily inlisted with the professed design of standing up in de∣fence of the liberties of your country, you are bound diligently to pursue those mea∣sures, and painfully endeavour to ac∣quire that skill which may most effectually qualify you for this purpose. To this end you will labour to make greater proficien∣cy in military knowledge. Your present improvements are observed with pleasure, and are an earnest of something still more considerable. Go on then, in pursuit of higher measures; <HI>rest not contented with any attainments to which you have already arrived; but leaving the things that are be∣hind, go on unto perfection.</HI> Much, you have been told, depends upon this, and without considerable understanding herein, defeat, if not destruction, will be your por∣tion;
<PB N="33" REF="013789_0032_0F91AEEF2ADA6DB0"/>
should you be called to encounter re∣gular troops. If you are not provided with proper instruments of war, it may be the fault of others; but if deficient in skill, it must be your own, especially as you have peculiar advantages for the obtain∣ment of it<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Every member of this Company, to the number of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7, being furnished with a military book, the generous present of Dr. JOHN TAYLOR, a gentleman truly distin∣guished for his patriotism, and hearty zeal in the cause of ilberty.</NOTE>. Be also persuaded to accus∣tom yourselves to order in your preparato∣ry exercises. Learn to be obedient to com∣mand <HI>now,</HI> or you will probably be regard∣less of it in the field of battle, where its want would prove destructive. This can∣not be too heartily pressed upon you, as it is so essential a point, and a quality also for which our militias have never been distin∣guished. And as it is at present somewhat probable that you will be ere long called from the field of exercise to that of battle, be exhorted to be ready for so hazardous a service, by diligently preparing for death: Set not too high a value upon life; <HI>count it not dear to you</HI>; think frequently of a <HI>better country,</HI> repent of your sins, inlist un∣der <HI>Jesus the Captain of your salvation; get your consciences purged from guilt, through the blood of Christ; acquaint your∣selves with him,</HI> and secure the friendship
<PB N="34" REF="013789_0033_0F91AEEFE2C31BE0"/>
of heaven: This will give you necessary courage, make you more indifferent about life, and be the means of <HI>covering your heads in the day of battle</HI>; for <HI>precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints</HI>; he guards them from danger, and so long as life is a blessing he will preserve it. <HI>Com∣mit your cause to God, trust also in him,</HI> and <HI>he will bring your reasonable wishes to pass.</HI> We sincerely wish you the greatest acquain∣tance with the arts of war, and all the gra∣ces and virtues of the Divine Spirit, to beau∣tify and adorn your souls; but we fervent∣ly pray, that you may never be called, in providence, to fight with, or shed the blood of British soldiers, <HI>who are bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh.</HI> It is the ardent wish of every good man, that the present unhap∣py controversy may be honorably termi∣nated without the effusion of human blood; and that the dark cloud and gloomy pros∣pects with which this year is ushered in, may be scattered long before the end of it: But if it must continue, and our invaluable li∣berties cannot be preserved, but by the sword you will then not shrink from danger, nor desert the cause, <HI>but be of good courage and play the men valiantly for your people, and the cities of your God.</HI></P>
<P>Should you die in battle, you will die in the bed of your honor, and names be had in ever∣lasting

remembrance? <HI>Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, let us all of every charac∣ter remember that we are here in a state of spiritual warfare, surrounded by numerous, subtil and potent foes, who are constantly seeking to seduce our minds to vice, and procure the destruction of our souls. Let us then inlist under Jesus, who is the Cap∣tain that has undertaken to lead on his troops against this formidable host to vic∣tory and to triumph. <HI>May we endure hard∣ness as good soldiers. May we take to our∣selves the whole armor of God, that we may be able to stand against the wilds of the devil, and quench all his fiery darts.</HI> May none of us be dastardly in this spiritual conflict, but being animated by that glorious crown that awaits the victors in heaven, may we fight valiantly, and be faithful unto death. <HI>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life.</HI></P>
