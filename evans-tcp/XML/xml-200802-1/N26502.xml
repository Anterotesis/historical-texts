<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE rise, progress, and improvements in anatomy, is an enquiry so highly de∣sirable, and essentially requisite for every student in the science, that the following history, collected from different authori∣ties, will, I presume, sufficiently recom∣mend itself to the anatomist, philoso∣pher, physician, and every person who esteems scientific pursuits deserving a part of their applications.</P>
<P>Young students too frequently labor un∣der innumerable difficulties in their appli∣cations to possess the works of the most valuable writers.—To attempt to select these from those of less estimation, would be a task which would not only require the most extensive reading, but the most judicious discernment.</P>
<P>However, I presume to offer an ar∣rangement of authors and professors in the periods in which they lived and flourished, together with their discove∣ries and improvements, and eulogiums, as given by the most celebrated modern professors.</P>

<HEAD>THE History of Anatomy.</HEAD>
<P>THE first medical man known to have written on Anatomy was Hippocrates, though before his time there is great reason to believe that this subject was in some degree understood. From the natural horror which attends medling with human dead bodies, it is probable that the first enquiries were made on the brute creation.</P>
<P>The descriptions of parts, given by early anatomists, evidently shew this; and when the anatomist had conquered his own prejudices he still would have the prejudices of the people to encounter, which in most countries have been so great as to endanger the life of him who at∣tempts it; this must necessarily impede the pro∣gress of the science.</P>
<P>The first knowledge on this subject was probably derived from the religious ceremony of performing sacrifices: in this ceremony particular parts were seperated for particular purposes, by which the sacrificer must have ac∣quired some knowledge of the interior parts of animals.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035232_0004_10017F275327EA58"/>
The superstitious maxim of prognosticating events by the appearances of the viscera, would contribute further to the acquisition of this knowledge.</P>
<P>The method of the Egyptians of embalm∣ing bodies, as mentioned by Josephus, must have caused the embalmers to have acquired some knowledge of the human subject.</P>
<P>Some passages in HOMER, who lived one thousand years before Christ▪ serve to shew he had some knowledge of this subject.</P>
<P>Some philosophers, about the time of Hip∣pocrates, appear to have been very much em∣ployed in enquiring into the structure of ani∣mals as a part of natural Philosophy; of these Democrates was particularly eminent. This philosopher lived at Abdera, four hundred and seventy years before Christ, AEtatis 109. He was supposed by his countrymen to be mad, who desired Hippocrates to visit him that he might be cured.</P>
<P>When Hippocrates first saw him, he was dissecting an animal to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over the seat of the bile, and from the conversation which passed between them, Hippocrates pronounced him to be the wisest man living.</P>
<P>Hippocrates appears to have been the first who seperated medicine from philosophy, and made the practice of it a distinct profession. He has pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d out to posterity the most certain means of practising the art successfully, by ac∣quiring
<PB N="5" REF="035232_0005_10017F2989DBBE20"/>
a knowledge of the structure, situation, and also the use of the various parts which com∣pose the human body. The history which he has written proves him to be a man of extraor∣dinary accuracy in his observations. His works have been justly admired in all ages, and accord∣ing to many of his enthusiastic admirers, they contain all the medical knowledge that has been since published. They also assert that the circulation of the blood, and other discoveries claimed by different anatomists, are to be found in his works—If, however, we impartially ex∣amine his opinions on the functions of parts, it must be acknowledged, that he was very er∣roneous, and that his anatomical descriptions are very defective. To judge the better of this, I will afford a concise view of his opinions on several parts, viz.—</P>
<P>First—That the heart was the origin of the blood and phlegm.</P>
<P>Secondly.—That the urine came from the spleen, and the bile from the liver.</P>
<P>Thirdly.—That the liver was the origin and root of the veins, as the heart is of the arteries.</P>
<P>Fourthly.—That the veins conveyed the blood to the different parts of the body, which motion he compares to the ebbing and flowing of the sea.</P>
<P>Fifthly.—That the arteries were the reser∣voirs of the spirit, or air, and conformable to this idea he speaks of the trachea as an artery,
<PB N="6" REF="035232_0006_10017F2BC5F43B20"/>
and accordingly called it <HI>Aspera Arteria,</HI> a name it still retains.</P>
<P>He applies continually the name of vein to the arteries, and also to the nerves and ureters: the nerves, tendons and ligaments are spoken of as being the same. He supposes the brain to be entirely glandular, and that it imbibed, like a sponge, the superfluous water from the heart. He says that the brain is the seat of prudence and of judgment: the spinal marrow, he observes, is continued from the brain, and that the term is improperly employed, as it is surrounded with membranes which the mar∣row in other bones is not. He says that the intestines are of a spongy texture where they touch the urinal bladder, through which the urine passes from the one to the other.—He observes that the kidneys ought to be classed with the glands, that they have an attracting power of imbibing a part of the fluids which are drank, and that it is filtered into water, and passe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from these into the bladder by veins:—he conceived the ureters to be veins, and from observing that they passed so directly into the bladder, he might suppose that they performed this office. In this works very little is said on the muscles, as he supposed that motion and sensation were performed by the arteries.</P>
<P>It is doubted by many whether he ever dis∣sected a human subject. <HI>Haller</HI> supposed that he had, from the description he has given of the
<PB N="7" REF="035232_0007_100164CD35AF1290"/>
subclavius muscle; but this evidence is not alone sufficiently convincing as that muscle ex∣ists in the ape, an animal which was common∣ly dissected at that time.</P>
<P>Hippocrates also tells us, as a great and mi∣raculous event, "he once in his life had the op∣portunity of seeing a human skeleton."</P>
<P>This great man is said to have been a descend∣ant of AEsculapius, he was born in the island of Cos, four hundred and sixty years before Christ, and died at ninety years of age, but according to some, he lived to be one hundred and four.</P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> followed the example of Pythagoras and Democrates, in teaching natural philoso∣phy, by treating of several parts of medicine, particularly the oeconomy of the human body, but on this subject his opinions are very erro∣neous.</P>
<P>He was born at Athens, four hundred and twenty nine years before Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle,</HI> preceptor of Alexander the Great, wrote a natural history of animals, which, (as Pliny relates) consisted of fifty books, there being now only eleven extant. From the ana∣tomy in that part of his works which remain, it is very evident he never had dissected the human subject.</P>
<P>He thought that the skulls of men were join∣ed by three sutures, and those of women by one only: he counts eight ribs on each side. Galen says he first named the aorta. He be∣lieved that the nerves arose from the heart,
<PB N="8" REF="035232_0008_10017F2EA3A8AD68"/>
and that the heart was composed of three cavi∣ties, containing three kinds of blood. He was born three hundred and eighty-four years be∣fore Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Diocles,</HI> a physician of great reputation, who flourished about one hundred and thirty years after Hippocrates, is said by Galen to have written a book of anatomy, in which the order of dissection is described for the purpose of de∣monstrating the different parts of the body.</P>
<P><HI>Praxagoras</HI> of Cos, whose works are also lost, is mentioned by Galen as an excellent anato∣mist. He first distinguished the arteries from the veins, which he describes as being the beat∣ing vessels, and containing only air or spirit; he supposed that the arteries changed into nerves from the diminution of their cavities towards their extremities.</P>
<P>The <HI>Alexandrian School,</HI> during the reigns of the Ptolemies who succeeded Alexander the Great, we find the study of anatomy flourished in Egypt. The second king of this name found∣ed an academy at Alexandria, in which there was a library said to contain two hundred thousand volumes. Some assert a number equal to double the above. In this school anatomy was particularly encouraged, all the executed criminals being sent there for dissection.</P>
<P>From the time of Hippocrates to the found∣ing of this school, which was more than two hundred years, physicians had made very little
<PB N="9" REF="035232_0009_10017F3030C13B50"/>
progress in anatomy, and it seems very proba∣ble that little, if any enquiry had been made, into the structure of the human body, and the brute creation was alone dissected.</P>
<P>Galen has given an account of the Alexan∣drian anatomists, two of which more particu∣larly deserve our attention, viz. <HI>Erasistratus</HI> and <HI>Herophilus.</HI>—</P>
<P><HI>Erasistratus</HI> discovered the lacteals in the me∣sentary of a goat; he explained the principal use of the brain and nerves, and divided the nerves into two kinds, one for the purpose of sensation, and the other motion, and observes that both kinds arose from the brain. He also describes the ventricles of the brain; he was not aware that the arteries and veins carried the same fluid, but supposed that when the lungs were distended with air, it passed from the branches of the bronchia into those of the heart, by which means he supposed the arteries were filled with it.</P>
<P><HI>Herophilus</HI> was contemporary with Erasistra∣tus in the Alexandrian school. He discovered the fourth sinus of the brain which still retains his name; he first named the plexus choroides, the tunica arachnoides, the retina and duode∣num, he compared the fourth ventricle of the brain in figure to a pen, and called it calamus scriptorius.</P>
<P>Ammiames Marcellinus, who lived about six hundred and fifty years after the establish∣ment
<PB N="10" REF="035232_0010_10017F3265C553A8"/>
of the Alexandrian academy, tells us, "They were so famous in his time, that it was sufficient to secure credit to any physician if he could say he had studied at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lexandria."</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ROME.</HEAD>
<P>It does not appear that anatomy was culti∣vated among the Romans before the Christian aera; for though <HI>Celsus,</HI> in his excellent works, <HI>"de Medica,"</HI> considers anatomy as the foun∣dation of medical knowledge. and usually gives a short, though generally correct, de∣scription of the parts before he describes their diseases, yet it appears that these descriptions were almost entirely taken from the great physicians, and there are scarcely any improve∣ments to be met with till near two hundred years after the birth of Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Ruffus</HI> wrote a work about one hundred and twelve years after Christ, in which he describes the recurrent nerves, and observes, that if pressure be made on the carotid arteries, the person will lose his voice from these nerves being compressed being situated on the sides of these vessels; he also describes the fallopean tubes, which were parts not known to pre∣ceding anatomists.</P>
<P>We now arrive at a period when a very ela∣borate work was published at Rome by Galen, who is said to have been born at Pergamus,
<PB N="11" REF="035232_0011_10017F3426E91AF8"/>
about the year one hundred thirty and one, and flourished about one hundred and seventy.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, this celebrated phy∣sician and philosopher, though a very great admirer and accurate observer of nature, lived to nearly the meridian of life an atheist, till one day alone in search of natural productions, he found a human skeleton, which lay exposed on the way side—the singularity of the event drew his attention, and in examining the wonderful machinism of his own frame, he was well assured it was of too curious and beautiful a formation to be the production of chance, and that none but a power infinitely superior to man could produce so strangely ad∣mirable a phenomenon; he was instantaneous∣ly converted to the belief of a Supreme Be∣ing, and fell upon his knees and burst forth in loud acclamations and praise—<Q>My Lord and my God! nothing but a Being Infinitely great as thou art, could ever form such a creature as man is,</Q> or to this effect.</P>
<P>His works contain all the learning of the foregoing ages, more especially of the Alex∣andrian school, where he studied. They are also enriched with descriptions drawn from dissections of the organs of animals, which are frequently compared with those of the human body, and in some instances has thrown light on the functions of organs by real ex∣periments, particularly on the motion of the
<PB N="12" REF="035232_0012_100164CEC6C4D190"/>
blood and the importance of the pulse. These works, therefore, are studied with entertain∣ment, if not with instruction—however, in general, it must be admitted that his opinions were hypothesis, but they were so plausibly connected into a system, that he was implicit∣ly followed for fourteen centuries. They have now long since been laid aside, as being in general the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allies of a luxuriant imagi∣nation.</P>
<P>Dr. Motherby, in his Medical Dictionary, has said, "The medicine of Galen had much affinity with that of Hippocrates, with this difference, that Hippocrates's depends on facts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> experience, and Galen's on reasoning. The genuine works of Hippocrates stand the test of ages, and improvements are rather ad∣ditions to, than alterations in him; but this is not the case with respect to Galen."</P>
<P>He divides the body into four parts, viz. The <HI>abdomen, thorax, head</HI> and <HI>extremities.</HI></P>
<P>He has given a good description of the ab∣dominal viscera, the peritonoeum and abdomi∣nal muscles; he speaks of the difference of the human and brute liver; he believes it to be the principal organ of sanguiferation, and the origin of the veins. He has also described the course of the venaportae from the intes∣tines to the liver. The spleen, he supposes, draws viscid humours from the liver by a ca∣nal leading from the one to the other—he also
<PB N="13" REF="035232_0013_10017F37ADA6A158"/>
says it communicates with the liver by a branch of the venaeportae, and with the heart by the arteries. He has given a very good descrip∣tion of the secretion of urine; he says, that the kidneys have the faculty of separating the superfluous water from blood; that it is col∣lected in a membranous cavity in the middle of the kidney, and that from this cavity a canal, to which he gives the name of ureter, passes to the bladder, and enters it obliquely, by which the urine is conveyed. He has given a tolerable description of the parts of genera∣tion in both sexes; his description of the gravid uterus is evidently from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e▪ In speaking of the connection between the soetus and mother, he describes the cotyledons, and the urachus leading from it to the bladder; the sunis, he says, has two arteries and two veins. In describing the thorasic viscera, he speaks of the valves of the heart, and the fo∣ramen ova<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. He describes the cartilages and muscles of the larynx; of the former he says there are three, viz. The thyroid, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an arytoenoid, which, he observes, is composed of two. The epiglottis he calls the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le tongue, and supposes it to be principally con∣cerned in composing the voice. He describes the ventricles of the brain, and their commu∣nications, the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iata, the thalami nervorum optic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and the tubercull quad∣ragemin—He also, with Herophilus, consi∣ders
<PB N="14" REF="035232_0014_10017F3930B8C740"/>
the nerves as arising from the brain, and traces them with tolerable accuracy. His book, "De Motu Musculorum," proves that he was well acquainted with the muscles and their functions. He has also given a good de∣scription of the bones, and their articulations.</P>
<P>The next anatomist of any reputation, was <HI>Soranus,</HI> of <HI>Ephesus;</HI> he settled last at Rome. Some of his works are contained in Coelius Aurelicanus; he has written an original tract on the female organs of generation, in which (his descriptions being taken from the human subject, are more correct than Galen's) he first described the hymen when he was profes∣sor of anatomy at Alexandria.</P>
<P>In the fourth century the Roman empire was over-run with the northern Barbarians, and learning in a great degree extinguished in the western parts; whilst in the Fast the phy∣sicians continued to follow Galen, and had little knowledge of anatomy.</P>
<P>We have in this period the works of AEtius, Paulus, AEgineta and Alexander, celebrated physicians.</P>
<P>About the end of the fourth century, <HI>Ne∣mesius,</HI> bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hop of Emissa, wrote a treatise on the nature of man, in which, it was said, were contained two celebrated modern disco∣veries, the one on the use of the bile boasted of by <HI>Sylvius de la Boe,</HI> and the other, the cir∣culation of the blood, claimed very justly by
<PB N="15" REF="035232_0015_10017F3B61CD4E18"/>
the immortal Harvey. This last, however, is proved by Dr. Friend, in his history of phy∣sic, page 229, to be falsely ascribed to this author.</P>

<HEAD>THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL.</HEAD>
<P>In thu sixth century Alexandria was taken by the Saracens, and the academy, which had subsisted near one thousand years, was entirely dispersed, and its celebrated library, the re∣pository of the learning of the eastern parts of the world, was almost consumed. How∣ever, when the Saracens were quietly settled in their conquests, they began to examine the remains of the Greek and Roman writers, and by degrees translated them into their own language, and added the history of some new diseases, as the small-pox and measles, with some new remedies, the produce of their own country.</P>
<P>In anatomy they made no improvements; for according to the tracts of their religion, a person after touching a dead body was sup∣posed unclean.</P>
<P>From the superstition which at this time overwhelmed Europe, all the sciences appear to have been at a stand, until the eleventh century, when academies began to be built in Europe, the arabians carrying their knowledge into the western parts.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035232_0016_10017F3D951EC0E8"/>
Academies and universities were instituted in Italy, and at Montpelier, in France.</P>
<P>For several years, however, the professors of anatomy contented themselves with com∣menting on the writings of the Arabians; so that, from the time of Galen (which was near one thousand years) the study of anatomy, so far from making any improvements, had been gradually losing ground; for the writings of the Greeks and Romans had been almost for∣gotten, and the original improvements entire∣ly neglected, while the writings of the Ara∣bians, which were very imperfect, had been substituted in their stead.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the fourteenth century an original work was written by Mundinus, in the year 1315, and although his descrip∣tions were extremely superficial and inaccu∣rate, his books were so highly esteemed, that by the order of the senate of Venice, the pro∣fessors at <HI>Padua</HI> were obliged to teach that only which occasioned a great number of com∣mentaries upon it. This law was observed for two hundred years</P>
<P>In 1440 the art of printing was discovered, and nearly about the same time Constantino∣ple, the seat of the empire, was taken by the Turks; in consequence of which learning was revived, and diffused over Europe by the learned men, who fled from the slavery of the Turks, and carried the original writings
<PB N="17" REF="035232_0017_100164D07A9A1EF8"/>
of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> along with them into the western parts.</P>
<P>The number of books now increased very considerably, and before the end of the cen∣tury several tolerable books of anatomy were published.</P>
<P>In the following century, the spirit of im∣provement was continued. The truly cele∣brated Dr. William Hunter mentions, as the most eminent anatomist of the fifteenth cen∣tury, Leonardo da Vinci. He first instituted anatomi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al drawings, some of which are now in possession in his Britannic majesty's great collection of original drawings, where the doctor was permitted to examine them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Vassare's lives of Painters.</HI></NOTE> Se∣veral discoveries were made by Sylvius, Ni∣cholaus Massa and others; but their merit was greatly eclipsed by their succeeding wri∣ters, viz. <HI>Vessalius, Fallopius</HI> and <HI>Eustachius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Andreas Vessalius</HI> was born at Brussels, 1514, and is said to have shewn a very early genius for anatomy; and after the advantage of stu∣dying in different universities, he was appoint∣ed professor of anatomy at <HI>Padua,</HI> in the twenty-third year of his age. He first pub∣lished his compendium of anatomy when on∣ly twenty five years of age, and afterwards his great work, in which he clearly describes the various organs of the body, and teaches
<PB N="18" REF="035232_0018_10017F3FC2C6A5C8"/>
his readers to follow him, by dissection, ex∣plaining his descriptions by tablets, which are at present admired by painters as well as ana∣tomists. which see in two large folio volumes, written in Latin.</P>
<P>This genius raised him above a servile at∣tachment to the antients: he has taken his descriptions from nature, and pointed out the errors of Hippocrates and Galen.</P>
<P>At the end of his work there are many ex∣periments on living animals, in order to de∣termine the use of organs, which merit par∣ticular attention, and none more than those on the blood vessels, which, when considered, it appears surprising that he missed the disco∣very of the circulation of the blood. He made a ligature on an artery, and observed that it pulsated on the side next the heart on∣ly; he then cut the artery through, and joined the two extremities with a pipe, when the distant portion of artery pulsated, though not when there was no communication. This experiment proved that their pulsation de∣pended on their being distended, which is an opinion diametrically opposite to that of <HI>Galen;</HI> he proves that the arteries naturally contain∣ed blood, by making two ligatures, and cut∣ting out the piece; he says there is no com∣munication through the septem from one side to the other of the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="035232_0019_10017F41F0D4CB20"/>
By opening the chest, he observed that the heart ceased to act, and that the lungs were motionless, by inflating the lungs with a pipe in the trachiae, that the heart again perform∣ed its actions; notwithstanding these experi∣ments, he still adhered to the old hypothesis.</P>
<P>This great merit drew upon him the envy of his cotemporaries, who did not fail to load him with calumny; but having truth on his side, they were at length led to imitate him.</P>
<P>This great reputation caused the Emperor Charles the fifth, to make him his physician, by whom he was greatly estemed, and which fixed him at court.</P>
<P>Vessalius's good fortune now met with a very sudden reverse; he having obtained per∣mission to examine the body of a Spanish gen∣tleman, whom he had attended as physician, it was observed where he opened the chest, the heart palpitated. The parents of the de∣ceased hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of this sad catastroph, per∣secuted him as a murderer, and accused him be∣fore the inquisition "of impiety." This se∣vere tribunal were going to punish his crime, when Philip the second, of Spain, found means to intercede in his favor, and he was ordered to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</P>
<P>Soon after this, Fallopius died, and he was recalled by the senate of Venice, to succeed him as professor of anatomy at Padua; but
<PB N="20" REF="035232_0020_100164D206E18150"/>
in his return he was wrecked on the isle of Zanta, where he died with hunger on the fifteenth of October, 1564, being then fifty years old.</P>
<P><HI>Sylvius</HI> attempts to correct and improve on Vessalius, and also Fallopius and Eustachius.</P>
<P>Columbus, Fallopius, Eustachius and Spigelius, improved, in many parts, the de∣scriptions of Vessalius</P>
<P>Of all Vessalius's pupils, there is none which merits our attention so much as Eu∣stachius who has very accurately described the structure of many parts which before had not been well understood The description he has given of the kidneys has scarcely receiv∣ed any addition by succeeding anatomists; he has also explained their functions by experi∣ments, and given a masterly account of their diseases—he made several discoveries on the organs of earing—he was the first who named the vena azagos, and has also clearly descri∣bed the thorasic duct, its situation and course, in a horse; but from his having supposed it to be a vein, the discovery is not generally given to him.</P>
<P>He composed a system of tablets, which lay hid for more than a century, not being brought to light till the year 1712, and which are at this day admired for their elegance and accuracy.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="035232_0021_10017F43739667D8"/>
The great outlines of the body, and its va∣rious organs, were now well understood and described, but the oeconomy remained very mysterious.</P>
<P>Learning became now diffused from Italy to the northern parts of Europe, and a system was published at Paris by Riolan, which re∣mained for many years the common standard of anatomy.</P>
<P>Experiments become now very frequent, and were made with infinite accuracy.</P>
<P>Hieronymus Fabricus ab Aquapendente—He was so surnamed from Aquapendente, a town in Tuscany, where he was born; he was professor of anatomy at Padua, from 1569 to 1619, when he died; he was the pre∣ceptor of the immortal Harvey—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n 1574, he observed and published on the valves of the veins. 'Tis said, father Paul informed him of them, but knew not either their structure or use. He was the first who considered the carnous coat of the bladder as a muscle con∣cerned in the expulsion of the urine.</P>
<P>In 1626, the lacteals were discovered by Ascellius, in opening living dogs.</P>

<HEAD>THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P>Dr. William Harvey, in 1628, published his works, "De motu Cordis et Sanguinis," in which he proves this great discovery of the
<PB N="22" REF="035232_0022_10017F48AC2DF790"/>
circulation, a doctrine he had taught many years before. This doctrine, which at once overturned the theories of the time, as well as every former system, and led the way to the discovery of many important truths▪ did not fail to draw upon its author many adver∣saries, who first endeavoured to disprove the doctrine; but not being able to invalidate the truth of the system, they endeavored to as∣cribe it to some other author.</P>
<P>Harvey was born at Folkstone, in Kent, in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>78: he had the happiness of establishing his theory on the most convincing and solid proofs.</P>
<P>This great man was physician to James the first and Charles the first, the latter of whom gave him the liberty of using all the deer in the royal forest for perfecting his discoveries on the generation of animals. It has been remarked that no physician in Europe, who had reached forty years, ever to the end of his life, adopted Harvey's doctrine of the cir∣culation of the blood, and that his practice in London diminished extremely by the reproach drawn upon him by that great discovery—He died in 1657, aged 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Servetus, who lived in the sixteenth century, is the only author who seems to have approached Harvey's doc∣trine.</P>
<P>Michel Servetus was a native of Arragon, in Spain, who had studied divinity as well as
<PB N="23" REF="035232_0023_10017F4C66110690"/>
anatomy; published a book, "De Trinitatis," which brought on him the vengeance of the inquisition, from which he escaped into France; but still continuing to publish his religious opi∣nions, he was condemned for heresy, and burnt in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>53, in the forty-fourth year of his age</P>
<P>In his book of the Trinity he says, "That the blood passes through the pulmonary ar∣tery into the pulmonary veins by some un∣known communications, and not through the septem of the heart, as was then supposed.</P>
<P>Within thirty years after the discovery of the circulation, the lymphatic system, was de∣scribed, not only in brutes, but also in the hu∣man, Pecquect discovered the thorasic duct, and traced the lacteals to it.</P>
<P>Rudbic and Bartholini completed the sys∣tem, by the discovery of the lymphatics.</P>
<P>The structure of every part began now to be minutely inquired into by the use of injec∣tions. Malpighi, physician to the Pope, and Ruysch, in Holland, were the first who claim∣ed this art in any degree of perfection, and more especially the latter.</P>
<P>Since the discovery of the circulation of the blood, many parts have been discovered, and their functions explained.</P>
<P><HI>Glyson</HI> has given a good description of the alimentary canal.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="035232_0024_100164D917F00570"/>

<P><HI>Willis</HI> on the brain, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower</HI> on the heart, are both better descriptions of these parts than had yet been given.</P>
<P>Anatomy became now generally studied—that well written books on the subject were published in almost every country in Europe; the most eminent of these are <HI>De Graaf, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w∣enhock, Swammerdan, Valsalva, Du Verney, Wins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, Leutaud, Heis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, Cooper, Albinus,</HI> and others.</P>
<P><HI>Haller</HI> has written an excellent work on physiology in Latin, and translated into Eng∣lish by the late ingenious Dr. Cullen, of Ed∣inburgh, to which is added a valuable index.

The following extract from Hall's Ency∣clopaedia. on the late improvements of ana∣tomy, and on the choice of anatomical au∣thors, I presume may also tend further to as∣sist the studies of anatomical pursuits.</P>
<P>The anatomists of this century have im∣proved anatomy, and made the study of it much more easy, by giving us more correct as well as more numerous figures. We have had four large folio books of figures of the bones, viz. Cheselden's, Albinus's, Sue's and Trew's—Of the muscles we have had two, one from Cowper, which is elegant, and one from Albinus, which, from the accuracy and labor of the work, we may suppose will never be outdone. Of the blood vessels we have a large folio from Dr. Haller. We have had one upon the nerves by Dr. Meckel, and an∣other by Dr. Monro, junior. We have had Albinus's, Roederer's, Jenty's and Dr. Hun∣ter's works, upon the gravid uterus; Weit∣brecht and Leber on the joints and fresh bones; Soemerring on the brain; Zinn on the eye; Cotunnius, Meckel, junior, &amp;c. on the ear; Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er on the nerves of the thorax and ab∣domen; Dr. Monro on bursae mucosoe, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It would be endless to mention the anato∣mical figures which have been published in this century, of particular and smaller parts of the body, by <HI>Morgagni, Ruysch, Valsalva,
<PB N="26" REF="035232_0026_10017F5933531578"/>
Sanctorini, Heister, Vater, Cant, Zimmerman, Walterus,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Those elegant plates on the brain, however, just published by M. Vicq d'Azyr, must not pass without notice, especially as they form part of an universal history of anatomy and physiology, both human and comparative, proposed to be published in the same splendid style; upon the brain alone nineteen folio plates are employed, of which several are co∣loured, The figures are delineated with ac∣curacy and clearness; but the colouring is rather beautiful than correct. Such parts of this work as may be published, cannot fail to be equally acceptable to the anatomist and the philosopher; but the entire design is appa∣rently too extensive to be accomplished within the period of a single life.</P>
<P>To the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oreign treatises already mentioned, we may add those recently publissied by Sab∣batier and Plenk, on anatomy in general. Among ourselves, the writings of Keil, Doug∣lass, Cheselden the first, Monro, Winslow, &amp;c. are too well known to need description. The last of these used to be recommended as a standard for the students of anatomy; but it has of late given place to a more accurate and comprehensive system, in three volumes, published by Mr Elliot, of Edinburgh, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plan approved by Dr. Monro, and executed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Mr. Fyfe. Dr. Simmon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, of London,
<PB N="27" REF="035232_0027_10017F5D9026A0D8"/>
has also obliged the world with an excellent system of anatomy, and another work, under the title of "Elements of Anatomy, and the animal oeconomy," in which the subjects are treated with uncommon elegance and per∣spicuity.</P>
<P>In the latter part of last century, anatomy made two great steps, by the invention of in∣jections, and the method of what we com∣monly call "preparations." These two mo∣dern arts have rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly been of infinite use to anatomy, and besides have introduced an ele∣gance to our administrations which in former times could not have been supposed to be pos∣sible.</P>
<P>They arose in Holland under Swammerdam and Ruysch, and afterwards in England un∣der Cowper, St. Andre, and others, where they have been greatly improved.</P>
<P>The anatomists of former ages had no other knowledge of the blood vessels than what they were able to collect from laborious dis∣sections, and from examining the smaller branches of them upon some lucky occasion, when they were found more than commonly distended with red blood. But filling the vascular system with a bright coloured wax, enables us to trace the large vessels with great ease, renders the smaller much more conscpi∣cuous, and makes thousands of the very mi∣nute ones visible, which from their delicacy
<PB N="28" REF="035232_0028_10017F61F859C418"/>
and the transparency of the natural contents, are otherwise imperceptable.</P>
<P>The modern art of corroding the fleshy parts with a menstruum, and leaving the moulded wax entire, is so exceedingly useful, and at the same time so ornamental, that it does great honor to the ingenious inventor, Dr Nicholls.</P>
<P>The wax work art of the moderns might deserve notice in any history of anatomy, if the masters in that way had not been so care∣less in their imitations. Many of the wax figures are so tawdry, with a show of unna∣tural colours, and so very incorrect in the cir∣cumstances of figure, situation, and the like, that though they strike a vulgar eye with ad∣miration, they must appear ridiculous to an anatomist. But those figures which are cast in wax, plaster or lead, from the real subject, and which of late years have been frequently made here, are of course very correct in all the principal parts, and may be considered as no insignificant acquisition to modern anatomy.</P>
<P>The proper or principal use of this art is to preserve a perfect likeness of such subjects as we can but seldom meet with, or cannot well preserve in a natural state—a subject in preg∣nancy, for example.</P>
<P>The modern improved method of preserv∣ing animal bodies, or parts of them, has been of the greatest servich to anatomy, especially
<PB N="29" REF="035232_0029_10017F6505F04768"/>
in saving the time and labor of the anatomist in the nicer dissections of the small parts of the body; for now whatever he has prepared with care, he can preserve, and the object is ready to be seen at any time; and in the same manner he can preserve anatomical curiosities of every kind such parts as are uncommonly formed, parts that are diseased, the parts of the pregnant uterus and its contents. Large collections of such curiosities, which modern anatomists are striving almost every where to procure, are of infinite service to the art, es∣pecially in the hands of teachers, to give clear ideas of many parts which it is essential to know, and yet which it is impossible that a teacher should be able to show otherwise, were he ever so well supplied with f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh sub∣jects.</P>
<P>A consideralbe list of anatomists, arranged in the order of the times in which they lived and flourished, may be found under the ar∣ticle "Anatomia," in Dr. Motherby's truly valuable medical dictionary.</P>
