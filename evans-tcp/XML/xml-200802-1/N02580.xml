<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE Venerable <HI>Author</HI> of the ensuing Dis∣course, who was <HI>forever devising</HI> Good, thinking how serviceable and glorious it would be, if when <HI>Matrimony</HI> is Solemnized, it might be done with <HI>Devotion</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> and with a Concern that, when the <HI>Hands</HI> are <HI>joined</HI> and so the <HI>united Hearts</HI> are signified, there may be a <HI>Desire</HI> of their Souls and a <HI>Consent</HI> of their <HI>Wills,</HI> that their SAVIOUR may be theirs, <HI>espoused</HI> unto them and <HI>concerned</HI> for them: I say, the Venerable <HI>Author,</HI> reflecting on these things, prepared the following Discourse for the Direction of (<HI>all</HI> indeed, but more especially) those engaging in this <HI>useful &amp; Heavenly Institution.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sermon</HI> was preached and fitted for the Press some Months before the <HI>Author's</HI> Death, who composed it for <HI>an agreeable Present unto the Candi∣dates of Wedlock</HI>; and as <HI>such</HI> it is approved by <HI>several Ministers,</HI> who hope, with me, that the Dis∣course will answer the <HI>pious Intentions</HI> of the Writer; while he is <HI>above</HI> rejoycing in JESUS CHRIST, the <HI>Bridegroom</HI> of his Soul.</P>

<HEAD>A Soul Espoused unto a SAVIOUR.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The most Marvellous <HI>Proposal</HI> that ever was made among the Children of Men, calls now for a most Admiring <HI>Attention</HI> from us.</HEAD>
<P>Tis that in, <BIBL>Rom. VII.4.</BIBL>
<Q>That ye should be MARRIED unto HIM who is Raised from the Dead.</Q></P>
<P>CAN such a Thing be heard with∣out Astonishment! —<HI>Sing O Hea∣vens, and be Joyful, O Earth, and break forth into Singing, O Moun∣tains</HI>; For, Oh! how astonishing are the <HI>Comforts</HI> which the Glorious Lord has for his Chosen People.</P>
<P><HI>Married</HI> unto a Glorious Christ, <HI>Raised from the Dead,</HI> and so taken up to, and sitting down on, the <HI>Throne of GOD.</HI> O Wonderful! O Wonderful! The Soul of a poor, Foolish, Filthy Creature; the Soul of a Miserable Sinner,—<HI>Married</HI> unto the Only Begotten Son of God, who has all the Angels in the Heavens forever Ordered by Him, and Ador∣ing of Him! To be <HI>Commanded</HI> by Him, is a <HI>Dig∣nity</HI>; To be <HI>Employed</HI> for Him, is an <HI>Advancement,</HI> beyond what we can desire. But then, to be <HI>Married</HI> unto Him!—<HI>Seemeth it a light matter unto you,</HI> O
<PB N="2" REF="003061_0004_0FEFB325265EFF80"/>
Children of Men! Verily, tis a matter which cannot (be sufficiently wondred at! But it is a matter, which we now have in prosecution and in expectation.</P>
<P>Behold, an lllustrious Demonstration, That Be∣lievers on a Glorious Christ are delivered from the <HI>Dominion of Sin.</HI> The <HI>Evil principle</HI> which disposes us to Sin, is mortified and extinguished in Believers, to such a degree, that tho' the <HI>Continuance</HI> of it is an Intolerable <HI>Vexation</HI> unto them, yet it has not a <HI>Dominion</HI> over them. While we remain under the <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> or the <HI>Covenant</HI> made with the <HI>First Adam,</HI> as the <HI>Head</HI> of his <HI>Natural Offspring,</HI> we are under a Law which requires a <HI>perfect Obedience</HI> from us, but at the same time it affords us no <HI>Strength</HI> for that <HI>Obedience</HI>: No; our <HI>Corrupt Nature</HI> is there∣by irritated unto <HI>Rebellion</HI> rather than annimated unto <HI>Obedience,</HI> and [the <HI>Evil Principle</HI> gains the Force of a <HI>Law</HI> upon us. The Law which in <HI>it self</HI> is <HI>Holy,</HI> and <HI>just</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> in the <HI>Event</HI> is turned into, a <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> unto us. If we read a few Lines more, we cannot but stand amazed at the Blindness of them, who exclude the <HI>Moral Law</HI> of the <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> from the meaning of the Apostles, and expound it only for the Law of the <HI>Mosaical Ceremonies,</HI> when here we read of being <HI>Delivered from the Law.</HI> But now, our Blessed Jesus is a <HI>Second Adam.</HI> And by our being united unto HIM, we are brought into a <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> In that <HI>Covenant</HI> the Redeemer, to whom we are <HI>united,</HI> makes Attonement for our Trespasses, against the <HI>Law,</HI> answers the Demands of the <HI>Law</HI> in our stead, and conveys into us by his Good Spirit a <HI>principle of Life,</HI> which quickens us to endeavour a <HI>perfection of Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Strengthens</HI> us to make a Gradual Progress towards a <HI>perfection of Holiness in the Fear of GOD.</HI> Thus we become <HI>Dead unto the Law</HI>! Our Hopes of obtaining the <HI>Justification of Life</HI> by our own doing of the <HI>Works</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> re∣quires,
<PB N="3" REF="003061_0005_0FEFB33B632160B0"/>
are all <HI>Dead.</HI> We have laid aside all Hopes of coming to <HI>Life,</HI> on those Terms of the <HI>Law, Do and Live.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> is also <HI>Dead</HI> unto us, and can make no more claim upon us, to adhere unto those Terms of, <HI>Do and Live,</HI> than a <HI>Dead Man</HI> can upon one that he was once by <HI>Marriage</HI> a Master of. Christians, You have the very <HI>Substance</HI> and <HI>Marrow</HI> of the Gospel, and a plain Gloss upon a famous Paragraph of the Sacred Scriptures, in these few Communications. But what is our Condition in this <HI>Change of our State</HI> before the Lord? And what is it that brings us into this Happy Condition? Tis this Marvellous Felicity; Our <HI>Marriage</HI> with a Redeemer that is <HI>Raised from the Dead.</HI> Of this I am now to Entertain you with a DOCTRINE, that brings unto us those <HI>Consolatioas of GOD,</HI> which, O <HI>Hard-Hearted</HI> we, if they be <HI>Small</HI> unto us!</P>
<P>A Soul <HI>Married</HI> unto a Jesus <HI>Raised from the Dead,</HI> is an <HI>Happy</HI> Soul. And it is by <HI>Marrying</HI> of us unto Himself that a Glorious CHRIST brings us to all the <HI>Happiness,</HI> which He has purpos'd and purchas'd for us. Our Apostle, Speaking of a People by his Ministry brought home unto GOD, and made an Happy People, says, 2 Cor. XI.2. <HI>I have Es∣poused you unto one Husband, that I may present you as a chast Virgin unto CHRIST.</HI> This, This is the main intent and business of the Evangelical Ministry. The Ministers of the Gospel are those <HI>Friends of the Bridegroom,</HI> that have a Work to do upon that Noble Design; To <HI>Espouse</HI> the Souls of their People, unto a Glorious Christ, who is willing to become an <HI>Husband</HI> unto them. Now to bring about this Blessedness to the Souls, with and for whom we are concerned, we are going to lay before you the most Important Things, that ever you were addressed upon; And we make our Address to you, with such a pathetic Observation, <HI>Hearken to
<PB N="4" REF="003061_0006_0FEFB32A754A9BD0"/>
me, that GOD may hearken unto you another Day.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The Glorious REDEEMER makes unto your <HI>Souls,</HI> O our Gospelized People, a Proposal to make you Happy in an ESPOUSAL unto Himself.</P>
<P>Can our Souls be any other than swallowed up with Admiration at the <HI>Mystery.</HI></P>
<P>The Infinite Son of GOD, <HI>Espoused</HI> the <HI>Nature</HI> of Man, when <HI>the Word was made Flesh,</HI> and he condescended so far as to take a Man in <HI>One Per∣son</HI> with Himself. The Almighty King, overlook∣ing all the Tribes of <HI>Created,</HI> and even of <HI>Angelic</HI> Beings, <HI>Espoused</HI> unto Himself a Queen, from the Family of <HI>Mankind.—Lord what are we? And what is our Fathers House?</HI> This He did, tho' He saw the Depravation which Mankind by a Fall from God comes to Sink into. A Thing which, Oh! how should we celebrate the <HI>Grace</HI>! <HI>Grace</HI>! that we see shining in it! What an Honour does it put upon the Humane Race! And how should it Encourage our Approaches unto our GOD.</P>
<P>But now, the GOD-MAN, or Immanuel, is upon the Glorious Design of <HI>Espousing</HI> to Himself a Church of People, cull'd and call'd out of <HI>Man∣kind,</HI> into the <HI>Faith</HI> of Him. There is a CHURCH of Believers on Him, a <HI>People formed for himself, to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w forth his praise,</HI> whom in a Mystical MARRIAGE He reckons Himself <HI>Espoused</HI> unto. This Church is by that <HI>Lamb of GOD</HI> Expressly called, <HI>his WIFE</HI>: And Effectually bringing this People into a <HI>Reconciliation</HI> with God, He says, Jer. III.14. <HI>I Marry my self unto you.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se with whom we are principally now concerned, would be little edified; with the Traditions among the <HI>Jews,</HI> of the <HI>Marriage</HI> between <HI>Tipheret</HI> and <HI>Maleuth,</HI> [So the Jewish Thrology calls the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and his <HI>Church</HI>] which we apprehend represented in the Song of <HI>Solo∣mon,</HI> and in the <HI>Forty-fifth Psalm</HI> of his Father <HI>David,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="003061_0007_0FEFB33FC2BE7FD8"/>
which that Song was built upon. Tis enough to say, That People bro't into the Life of GOD, have that word fulfill'd unto them; Hos. II.18, 19. <HI>I will espouse thee unto me for ever; yea, I Will espouse thee unto me in Justice, and in Judgment, and in Loving-Kindness, and in Mercies. I will even espouse thee unto me in Faithfulness, and thou shalt know the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But then, What we would more particularly insist upon, is, That every particular Soul brought home unto God, is <HI>Espoused</HI> unto the SON of God. GOD the KING <HI>Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, makes a Marriage for His SON</HI> in the <HI>Conversion of a Sinner</HI> to Him. In the moment that any of you make the Flight of a Distressed Soul unto your SAVIOUR, who has in Him the <HI>Only Name,</HI> [even the Name of JEHOVAH] <HI>whereby we must be saved,</HI> and entreat of Him, and rely on Him, for His <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> from that Moment thou art Espoused unto Him, and in whatever part of the Earth He finds thee, His Voice to thee, is that, Isa. LIV.5. <HI>Thy Maker is thy Hus∣band ; and thy Redeemer; the G0D of the whole Earth shall he be called.</HI></P>
<P>This, This is the <HI>Espousal,</HI> unto which, O Soul Enjoying the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> of the Gospel, thou art now therein Sollicited.</P>
<P>The Method of coming into the unparallell'd <HI>Espou∣sal,</HI> and so unto Everlasting <HI>Happinses,</HI> is briefly this.</P>
<P>There is a COVENANT of Life, wherein the SON of GOD has engaged these Two things unto his FA∣THER, on the behalf of his People which are in the Eternal <HI>Election</HI> of GOD <HI>given</HI> unto Him: The First That he will by answering the Law of GOD for them, furnish them with a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and a <HI>Righteous∣ness,</HI> on the pleading whereof they shall be <HI>Forgiven</HI> and <HI>Accepted</HI> with Him: The Second, That He will write the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD in their Hearts, and <HI>Heal</HI> all that is amiss in them, and <HI>work in them
<PB N="6" REF="003061_0008_0FEFB32C76A570E0"/>
what is well pleasing in the sight of GOD,</HI> and having by a <HI>Sanctifying work</HI> upon their <HI>whole Man,</HI> prepared them for the <HI>Inheritance of the Saints,</HI> bring them to the <HI>Spiritual Blessings of the Heavenly places.</HI> A Soul desiring to be comprehended in the Engage∣ments of this COVENANT, and consenting that a Glorious CHRIST should <HI>fulfill</HI> for it and in it, all <HI>this Good Pleasure of His Goodness,</HI> is brought into the COVENANT of Grace, and is therein <HI>Espoused unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This Transaction appears under the Character of a <HI>Marriage,</HI> because from this Time, there is an UNION, and not only a <HI>Legal Union,</HI> but also a <HI>Vital Union,</HI> between the <HI>Redeemer</HI> and the <HI>Believer.</HI> It comes to that, Joh. XIV.20. <HI>You in Me, and I in You:</HI> As upon an Espousal, the <HI>Married Couple</HI> becomes <HI>One flesh,</HI> so the <HI>Redeemer</HI> and the <HI>Believer</HI> become ONE, both in point of <HI>Interest,</HI> and in point of <HI>Influence.</HI> The Debts of the <HI>Believer</HI> ly on the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and the <HI>Redeemer</HI> pays them all. The <HI>claims</HI> of the <HI>Redeemer</HI> are imparted unto the <HI>Believer,</HI> and the <HI>Believer</HI> is Entitled unto His precious <HI>Benefits</HI>; What He has bought belongs to thee, <HI>O thou Blessed of the Lord.</HI> At the same time the <HI>Redeemer</HI> does Converse with the <HI>Believer</HI>; and <HI>follow him with Goodness and Mercy all his Days,</HI> and receives him into the <HI>Mansions</HI> of His <HI>Fathers House</HI> at the proper period of his Days, and Show, Oh! <HI>What Wonders to the Dead!</HI> The <HI>Believer</HI> does depend on the <HI>Re∣deemer</HI> for all the <HI>Blessings of Goodness,</HI> and pay Him all possible <HI>Affection</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI>; Delighting in <HI>Communion</HI> with Him; and Resolving to be <HI>for Him and not for another.</HI> He is thy Lord, and, O Loyal and Faithful one, Thou dost <HI>Worship Him.</HI></P>
<P>That which gives yet a further Appearance of a <HI>Marriage</HI> in this Grand Affair, is, Its conformity to what passed in the Case of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and the <HI>First Marriage,</HI> even that which was made in <HI>Para∣dise.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="003061_0009_0FEFB3417107D588"/>
An Apostle of GOD Writing of that <HI>Marriage</HI> says, Eph. V.32. <HI>This is a Great Mystery: But I speak about CHRIST and his Church. Adam</HI> was thrown into a sort of a <HI>Swoon,</HI> wherein GOD as I conceive, Extracted from his whole <HI>Inward,</HI> (which we render his <HI>Rib</HI>) the Substance, which He framed into the Shape that He gave to Eve, and which was <HI>Bone of his Bones, and Flesh of his Flesh</HI>: So that she became his <HI>Consort,</HI> who was also his <HI>Offspring.</HI> Accordingly a Glorious CHRIST having passed thro' the Agonies and Convulsions of <HI>Death</HI> for it, has those produced for Him, and for a most Intimate and Endearing Fellowship with Him; who are also pro∣duced <HI>from</HI> Him, and are indeed His <HI>Offspring.</HI> He Sees His own Seed in them, and He owns them for <HI>Members of his Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bones.</HI> And <HI>as the Bridegroom rejoyces over the Bride, so shall thy GOD rejoyce over thee,</HI> O Soul, willing to be the Lord's.</P>
<P>This then is the Thing proposed by our SAVI∣OUR to us. Yea, <HI>Hear this O all ye People, Every one of you!</HI> Tis to <HI>Every One of You</HI> all, that our SAVIOUR does propose it; and this is the <HI>Gospel</HI> to be <HI>Preached unto Every Creature.</HI> Soul, be willing to come into an UNION with thy SAVIOUR.</P>
<P N="2">II. O you to whom there is the <HI>Word</HI> of such a <HI>Salvation</HI> sent; Your <HI>Compliance</HI> with the <HI>Proposal</HI> of your Glorious REDEEMER for your ESPOUSAL to Himself, does declare you <HI>Espous'd</HI> unto Him, and render you interminably Happy in Him. Tis the Speaking of ONE WORD, upon an overture of a <HI>Marriage,</HI> which determines the Matter. Soul, Tis the Hearty Speaking of ONE WORD which will <HI>Marry</HI> thee unto thy SAVIOUR. That ONE WORD, <HI>Receive me to thy Mercy, and thy Glory O my SAVIOUR.</HI> That ONE WORD, <HI>O my
<PB N="8" REF="003061_0010_0FEFB34FA583A340"/>
SAVIOUR, make me thy own forever.</HI> That ONE WORD, <HI>Lord, I am Thine, Save me.</HI> The People <HI>Espoused</HI> unto the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> are called, Psal. CX.3. <HI>His Willing People.</HI> Tis their being made <HI>Willing</HI> to be <HI>His</HI> that makes them such an <HI>Happy People.</HI> Soul, when thy SAVIOUR makes His Proposal, <HI>Shall I take thee, and make thee my own, and Feed thee and Cloath thee, and Lead thee, and Shield thee, and use thee as my own, and bring thee to be all that I would have mine to be!</HI> Let thy co∣nquered Heart comply with it, and Reply, <HI>O my SA∣VIOUR, I resign my self unto thee; do thou take possession of me!</HI> Lo, <HI>Tis done! Tis done!</HI> This ONE WORD fetch'd from thy Heart by the <HI>Victorious Grace</HI> of GOD has Eternally Saved thee. The SPI∣RIT of GOD inclining the Soul to say unto the SA∣VIOUR, the <HI>Justifier, the Sanctifier, Oh! when will thou come unto me!</HI> He does thereby make that Soul a <HI>Bride</HI> for the SON of GOD. It is the <HI>Bride</HI> that says COME! He waits for that <HI>Voice</HI> of His Dove: <HI>Oh! Let not the only Comforter that can relieve my Soul be far from me: Let there no longer be a distance between me and my SAVIOUR; and let not my Sin hide His Face from me.</HI> Upon this He says, <HI>O my Dove, I take thee into the Clifts of the Rock: Thou shalt be under the shadow of my Wings forever.</HI> It may be Illustrated from the <HI>Espousal</HI> of <HI>Rebeckah</HI> unto <HI>Isaac.</HI> When the <HI>Glories</HI> and the <HI>Desires</HI> of the Excellent Person, and of his Father, had been told her, and it was demanded, <HI>Wilt thou go unto him, and be his</HI>? Her answer of Complyance, <HI>I will go,</HI> Settled all; there needed no more to be said. Soul, <HI>The Word of Truth, and Gospel of thy Salvation,</HI> tells thee, The SON of GOD is a Person beyond all Imagination Glorious, and He is <HI>The Lord of all.</HI> He would gladly make thee <HI>His own</HI>: And His FATHER sends His <HI>Gospel,</HI> to inform thee and assure thee of it. Art thou willing
<PB N="9" REF="003061_0011_0FEF973C562CBA30"/>
to <HI>Go</HI> and live with Him, and prize Him, and serve Him, and <HI>Be what he would have thee to be</HI>? That answer of Compliance, <HI>I will go,</HI> This will settle it; And His Holy SPIRIT will make a sweet <HI>Seizure</HI> on thee; and He will have thee and hold thee for <HI>His own</HI> forevermore. Is it possible to reject such a <HI>Motion!</HI>—</P>
<P>But then, in <HI>Complying</HI> with it, most certainly, it will not be possible to be any other than inexpressibly <HI>Surprized</HI> at it. All the <HI>Surprize</HI> that was expressed by the Lady unto whom <HI>David</HI> sent the Motion of her becoming his, must fall far short of thy <HI>Surprize,</HI> and Marvel, and Rapture, upon this motion from the <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Lord of David.</HI>—<Q>What? The <HI>King of Glory</HI> Stoup at this rate! The <HI>King of King</HI>'s take such an odious <HI>Leper</HI> into his Bosom, and one so <HI>full of putrifying Sores</HI>! The Infinite GOD, look with such an Eye, upon such a <HI>Worm of the Dust▪ The High and Lofty one who inhabits E∣ternity, Espouse</HI> unto Himself this poor, <HI>Humble, Contrite</HI> and self abhorring Soul. The Match be∣tween the <HI>Thistle</HI> and the <HI>Cedar</HI> in <HI>Lebanon,</HI> had no <HI>Disparity</HI> comparable unto this. One fetch'd from
a <HI>Generation of Vipers,</HI> to be a <HI>Bride</HI> for the <HI>Lamb of GOD!</HI> He that is <HI>of purer Eyes than to behold evil and cannot look upon Iniquity,</HI> with such tender Eyes to <HI>behold</HI> one so full of <HI>Evil,</HI> and <HI>look</HI> so <HI>tenderly</HI> on one abounding with <HI>Iniquity</HI>! Lord, When thou feest me such a <HI>Lothsome</HI> wretch, cast out unto the <HI>lothing</HI> of my <HI>Person,</HI> as <HI>in the Day that I was born,</HI> is this the <HI>time of thy Love</HI>! Wilt thou now <HI>Enter into Covenant</HI> with me, and <HI>thoroughly wash me,</HI> and gird me about with thy <HI>Fine Linnen,</HI> and adorn me with thy <HI>Jewels,</HI> and put thy <HI>Crown</HI> upon my Head, and make my <HI>Beauty perfect</HI> thro' thy <HI>Comeliness</HI> which thou wilt put upon me! <HI>Is this the manner of Men, O Lord GOD!</HI>—I could never have believ'd it;
<PB N="10" REF="003061_0012_0FEFB32EF300C340"/>
But, <HI>Thy Thoughts and Ways are not like ours.</HI> Now, <HI>Lord, I believe it, help thou my unbelief!</HI> But, O ye Heavens, be you forever fill'd with the <HI>Praises,</HI> the <HI>Praises,</HI> the <HI>High Praises</HI> of this peerless <HI>Grace.</HI> Let the whole <HI>Earth</HI> be filled with the <HI>Glory</HI> of it.</Q></P>
<P>—I return.</P>
<P>And I add, In our Compliance, with such a Gra∣cious motion, <HI>two things</HI> must not be forgotten. Remember <HI>This.</HI> We must resolve to be forever and <HI>entirely</HI> at the Disposal of our SAVIOUR; and <HI>com∣ply</HI> with every thing that He will have to be done either <HI>on</HI> us, or <HI>by</HI> us. Our compliance must be <HI>without Reserve.</HI> And Remember <HI>This.</HI> If we <HI>com∣ply</HI> with our SAVIOUR, we must own 'tis <HI>His Work</HI> that has <HI>drawn</HI> us and <HI>brought</HI> us and help't us to it. Our <HI>Compliance</HI> must not be ascribed unto the <HI>Free-will,</HI> of an <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>Desperately Wicked.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. In your ESPOUSAL to the REDEEMER, who is now making of you Happy in His <HI>Espousing</HI> of you to Himself, you must particularly consider Him as one <HI>Raised from the Dead.</HI> The Resur∣rection of our Blessed JESUS from the Dead, has, we find, Act. I. 3. <HI>Many Insallible Proofs.</HI> Never any matter of Fact in the World had such <HI>Infallible Proofs</HI>!</P>
<P>But now, in your <HI>Espousal</HI> to Him. considering Him, as one <HI>Raised from the Dead</HI>; You are first of all made sensible, That the <HI>Glorious Gospel of the Blessed GOD,</HI> Which aims to make you Happy in <HI>Espousing</HI> you unto Him, is no <HI>Cunningly devised Fable.</HI> No, it has received such an indisputable <HI>Con∣firmation,</HI> in the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of our JESUS from the Dead, that it is no longer to be doubted of; it cannot without most Criminal <HI>Blasphemies</HI> be doubt∣ed of. Tempted unto any <HI>Infidelity,</HI> or unto the
<PB N="11" REF="003061_0013_0FEFB34829F787C0"/>
least <HI>Suspicion</HI> of the Truth in any thing which the Gospel has Reveled unto us, you need no more to Silence the Temptation but This, My <HI>JESUS it Risen from the Dead.</HI> The <HI>Fiends</HI> will <HI>fly</HI> before this Faith, as at the <HI>Voice of Thunder.</HI> O Soul <HI>Es∣poused</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR, thou canst not but say upon every Article of it, <HI>Lord, I believe it, and I am sure of it! Lord, it is a faithful saying, and worthy of all Acceptation.</HI></P>
<P>But then, Your <HI>Espousal</HI> unto your SAVIOUR, must feel yet more particular, and most moving and melting <HI>Encouragements</HI> from this consideration.</P>
<P>Consider This. <Q>O Glorious JESUS, <HI>Raised from the Dead,</HI> Thou art gone up to, and sat down at, the <HI>Right hand of GOD.</HI> All the <HI>Caelestial Powers</HI> are thy Subjects and Servants; There is <HI>no Numbers of thy Armies.</HI> Yea, <HI>All Power in Heaven and Earth</HI> is given to thee; the <HI>Government</HI> of the whole World is in thy Almighty Hands. <HI>O my Soul what a SAVIOUR art thou to be Espoused unto</HI>!</Q></P>
<P>Consider this. <Q>O Glorious JESUS, <HI>Raised from the Dead,</HI> thou hast had a Release from the <HI>Prison</HI> to which thou wast Committed for my Offences. Thou hast been Acquitted from every <HI>Charge,</HI> which the Violated Law of GOD had against those that belong unto thee. If I am thine, I am one of those for whom the Triumph is made, <HI>who can lay any thing to the Charge of GOD's Elect. O my Soul, what a SAVIOUR art thou to be Espoused unto</HI>!</Q></P>
<P>Consider this. <Q>O Glorious JESUS, <HI>Raised from the Dead,</HI> thou art the <HI>Prince of Life</HI>; and thou dost bestow <HI>Life</HI> upon, infuse <HI>Life</HI> into them that belong unto thee. If I am thine, thou wilt Be and Act as a <HI>principle of Life</HI> in me, and <HI>Quicken</HI> me to <HI>Live unto GOD</HI>: The Best thing that can be done, for a Soul <HI>Dead in Trespasses and Sins</HI>! <HI>O

my Soul, what a SAVIOUR art thou to be Espous'd unto</HI>!</Q></P>
<P>Consider this. <Q>O Glorious JESUS, <HI>Raised from the Dead,</HI> thou wilt <HI>Require,</HI> but thou wilt also <HI>Procure</HI> my walking before GOD in a <HI>Newness of Life.</HI> Thou dost Rescue from the <HI>Dead Works</HI> of the <HI>Old Man,</HI> &amp; from a <HI>Vain Conversation</HI> all that belong unto thee. If I am thine, thou wilt make a <HI>New Creature</HI> of me. And being <HI>Renewed in the Spirit of my Mind,</HI> thou wilt enable me to lead a <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Sober</HI> and <HI>Righteous Life</HI> before thee. <HI>O my Soul, what a SAVIOUR art thou to be Espoused unto</HI>!</Q></P>
<P>Finally, Consider this. <Q>O Glorious JESUS, <HI>Raised from the Dead</HI>; my <HI>Head</HI> is <HI>Raised</HI> from the Dead; then I shall be so too. Thou wilt bring me to be <HI>where thou art,</HI> and there <HI>behold thy Glory.</HI> Yea, thou wilt bring me to be <HI>as thou art,</HI> where I shall <HI>behold thy Glory.</HI> If I am thine, I shall be fetch'd up into thy <HI>Holy City</HI>; and when thou, O Great KING, hast brought me into thy <HI>Chambers,</HI> How Great, <HI>How Great is the Good</HI> which I shall find <HI>laid up</HI> for me there! <HI>O my Soul, what a Saviour art thou to be Espoused unto</HI>!</Q> Be∣hold the Notes of the <HI>Epithalamium,</HI> or, Wedding Song to be Sung on this occasion!</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>O! Happy the People, that are in such a Case! Happy the People whose GOD is the Lord</HI>! Yea, who, who is there Qualified <HI>Sufficiently to de∣clare the Happiness of such a Marriage</HI>!</P>
<P>O Soul <HI>Espoused</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR, canst thou be more <HI>Happy</HI> than such an <HI>Espousal</HI> cannot fail to make thee? The <HI>Day of Espousal</HI> is called, Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> .III. 2. <HI>The Day of the Gladness of the Heart.</HI> Be sure, The <HI>Day of thy Espousal</HI> to thy SAVIOUR may well be the <HI>Day of the Gladness of thy Heart.</HI> It is the very Spirit of Genuine PIETY, <HI>To Rejoyce
<PB N="13" REF="003061_0015_0FEFB34AB3E7A8A0"/>
in CHRIST JESUS.</HI> Verily all the joy that can be wish'd for, belongs unto thee, if thou art <HI>Espoused</HI> unto CHRIST JESUS. Thou art now <HI>Espoused</HI> unto One, who is the <HI>Most High Possessor of Heaven and Earth; Espoused</HI> unto One, who has <HI>unsearchable Riches.</HI> O Wealthy Soul! O <HI>Hap∣py Soul!</HI> The Great GOD now sends this Advice unto thee, <HI>Be of good Cheer; thy Sins are forgiven thee</HI>! The <HI>Spouse</HI> of his own SON can't ly under a Sentence of <HI>Death.</HI> Yea, He has taken all thy <HI>Fil∣thy Garments</HI> from thee; and being the KINGS <HI>Daughter,</HI> he makes thee <HI>All Glorious within,</HI> and thy <HI>Covering</HI> is of <HI>Spangled Robes</HI> which are <HI>Inlaid with Gold; In Robes of Needle Work, thou shalt be brought in unto the King.</HI> He that <HI>sits on the Throne of G0D</HI> calls thee His <HI>Hephzibah,</HI> and says, <HI>my De∣light is in thee.</HI> Yea, He will make all the Heavens to <HI>know that He has Loved thee.</HI> O <HI>Happy Soul</HI>! Being <HI>Espoused</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR, His FATHER becomes thy FATHER; His GOD becomes thy GOD. And who can comprehend what is contained in that Ravishing word! Rom. VIII.17. <HI>Children; Then Heirs; Heirs of GOD, and Joint Heirs with CHRIST.</HI> What a vast <HI>Jointure</HI> hast thou! That Word has the <HI>Deed</HI> in it; <HI>All things are yours, and ye are CHRIST'S</HI>: Of <HI>His Fulness</HI> thou shalt receive, having a <HI>Right</HI> now unto it; Receive even Heaps of <HI>Grace upon Grace</HI>; the <HI>Favours</HI> of Heaven even heaped upon thee. O <HI>Happy Soul!</HI> What mayst thou promise to thy self now from such an <HI>Espousal</HI>! Even all the Good that is laid up in the <HI>exceeding great and precious promises</HI> of the <HI>Gospel:</HI> All the <HI>Promises</HI> that are the portion of the <HI>Overcomer,</HI> who shall <HI>Inherit all things:</HI> All the <HI>Promises</HI> relating to the <HI>Life that now is,</HI> and the <HI>Life that is to come.</HI> In the <HI>Life</HI> that <HI>Now</HI> is, thy Espoused LORD, will not suffer thee to <HI>want any thing that shall be good</HI> for thee; will make <HI>All things to work together</HI> for
<PB N="14" REF="003061_0016_0FEFB3352C0A94F8"/>
thy <HI>Good</HI>; will employ His <HI>Angels</HI> to be thy <HI>Guar∣dians,</HI> and His <HI>Ministers</HI> in unknown <HI>Good Offices</HI> for thee. But, Oh! For the <HI>Life</HI> that is <HI>to come,</HI>—<HI>Eye has not seen, Ear has not heard,</HI> there has not been any <HI>Ascent</HI> high enough in the <HI>Heart of Man to conceive,</HI> what thy Espoused LORD intends to do for thee. What an <HI>easy Lodging,</HI> will thy SAVIOUR provide for thee in His <HI>Paradise,</HI> when thy expired <HI>Spirit</HI> is turn'd out of Doors! But what a <HI>Body</HI> will He endow it withal, when He shall <HI>bring thee with Him,</HI> at His descending to Burn and Judge and Rule the World! What will thy SAVIOUR do for thee, in His Heavenly <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; when He will <HI>present thee Faultless before the presence of His Glory with exceeding joy</HI>; and all that He has ever helped thee to do for Him, shall from His <HI>Book of Remembrance</HI> be published unto <HI>Praise and Honour and Glory</HI>; and have unutterable <HI>Rewards</HI> assign'd unto it. What will thy SAVIOUR do for thee, when he has thee forever with Him in a <HI>Deathless</HI> and <HI>Sinl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss</HI> World; where the overwhelming Testimonies and Emantions of His <HI>Everlasting Love,</HI> shall be multiplied in a Boundless <HI>Variety</HI> and an endless <HI>Eternity</HI> upon thee, and He shall in Ways that will well become an Om∣nipotent GOD, make Thee and all His Holy ones, to <HI>know that he has loved thee! O Happy Soul!</HI> O <HI>Happy Soul</HI>!</P>
<P>But now, the <HI>Conclusion of the matter!</HI> O Solli∣cited Soul, No longer, No longer continue <HI>Stout∣hearted and far from Righteousness and</HI> Happiness. No longer, No longer, delay to Ascertain thy <HI>Es∣pousal</HI> to thy SAVIOUR. Oh! May our Young PEOPLE be so <HI>wise unto Salvation,</HI> as to think of no other <HI>Marriage</HI> till this <HI>Espousal</HI> be brought about! Yea, may those that are too <HI>Young</HI> to have a <HI>Mar∣riage</HI> for them talk'd of, yet come into this <HI>Espousal.</HI> Soul, tho' yet in thy, <HI>Minority</HI> get out of that <HI>Estrange∣ment</HI> from thy SAVIOUR, wherein thou hast the
<PB N="15" REF="003061_0017_0FEFB34E208D05E8"/>
<HI>Wrath of GOD abiding</HI> on thee, and thou art in Hourly Danger of <HI>Dying in thy Sins</HI>—which if thou do—it <HI>had been good for thee, that thou hast never been born.</HI> Thy SAVIOUR again Repeats his PROPOSAL; <HI>Art thou willing to be mine, and willing that I should bring thee to all that I bring my chosen to</HI>? Heaven is waiting to hear thy <HI>Answer.</HI> Oh! Let thy Immediate ANSWER be, <HI>My dear SAVIOUR; made me willing; thou hast, thou hast made me willing. Let my Beloved be mine, and let me be his forevermore.</HI> Is this the ANSWER? O <HI>Happy Soul</HI>; There is <HI>Joy in Heaven</HI> over thee. The <HI>Morning Stars</HI> now <HI>sing together</HI>; the <HI>Sons of GOD shout for joy,</HI> upon thy SAVIOUR thus <HI>Espousing</HI> of thee!</P>
<P>But it must be Remembred; That if thou art <HI>Es∣poused</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR, it will be made evident in thy <HI>bringing forth fruit</HI> unto GOD by him; yea, in thy hearing the <HI>Fruits of Righteuosnes, which are by</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>unto the Glory &amp; praise of G0D.</HI></P>
<P>[COROLLARY.]</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Espoused</HI> of the LORD, <HI>Count all His Precepts concerning all things to be right,</HI> so such as are in the MARRIED STATE of Life, and bear a <HI>Conjugal Relation</HI> to one another, if they are Espoused unto the Lord, this will be found among the <HI>Fruits</HI> of it; They will Study in their <HI>Good Carriage</HI> to∣wards one another to exhibit a Lively <HI>Emblem,</HI> of what passes between the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and His CHURCH.</P>
<P>Unto a MARRIED COUPLE it is impossible to do any thing more Seasonable and Serviceable, than to Recommend unto them a serious and frequent Me∣ditation [First on their own <HI>Latter End,</HI> and then] on the <HI>Latter End</HI> of the <HI>Fifth Chapter</HI> in the Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians.</HI> My Friends, the Sum of your
<PB N="16" REF="003061_0018_0FEFB337080C4D80"/>
Duty lies in this. Let the HUSBAND <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>How wondrously does my SAVIOUR love his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and show compassion to it, and make provision for it</HI>? Let the WIFE a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> think, <HI>How does the CHURCH study to Gratify her SAVlOUR, and give Him cause to call her Hephzibah, and say, my Delight is in her.</HI></P>
<P>And then, Do as all that are truly <HI>Espoused</HI> unto their SAVIOUR, will easily do; and practise on the Golden Maxim, <HI>Do as you would be done unto.</HI> O RELATIVES, [or, Are you not <HI>Really</HI> too <HI>Near</HI> and even too much ONE, to be called so] change Stations each of you with your CORRELATES. Let the HUSBAND think, <HI>If I were the WIFE, what Goodness would I look to be treated with!</HI> Let the WIFE think, <HI>If were the HUSBAND, what Kindness would I look to be treated with!</HI> I think, I have said <HI>much</HI> in a little. I hope, I need say <HI>no more.</HI></P>
