<HEAD>Christmas well kept, AND THE Twelve Days well spent, An Extract from Mr. Whitefield's Journal. 1738, 9.</HEAD>

<P>BEing <HI>Christmas-Eve,</HI> and hav∣ing preached <HI>twice,</HI> I went in the Even∣ing to <HI>Crooked-Lane</HI> Society, where God enabled me to withstand se∣veral Persons, who cavil'd against the Doctrine of the <HI>New Birth.</HI> I then went and expounded to a Company at Mr.

<HI>B—'s,</HI> in <HI>Little-Britain,</HI> and then went to another <HI>Love Feast</HI> in <HI>Fetter-Lane,</HI> and continued till near <HI>four</HI> in the Morning in <HI>Prayer, Psalms, &amp; Thanksgiving,</HI> with many truly Christian <HI>Brethren;</HI> and my Heart was much enlarged &amp; full of Love. God gave me a great Spirit of Suppli∣cation; <HI>Adored be his free Grace in Christ Jesus,</HI> Amen &amp; Amen.</P>
<P>MONDAY <HI>Decem.</HI> 25. About <HI>four</HI> I went and prayed and expounded to another Society in <HI>Red-Cross-Street,</HI> con∣sisting of near two or three hundred People, the Room was exceeding hot. I had been <HI>watching unto Prayer</HI> all Night, yet God vouchsafed so to fill me with his blessed Spirit, that I spake with as great Power, as I ever did in my Life. My Body was weak, but I found a supernatural Strength, and the Truth of that Saying, <HI>When I am weak, then am I strong.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Six</HI> I went to <HI>Crutched-Friars</HI> Society, and expounded as well as I could, but perceived my self a little op∣pressed with Drowsiness. <HI>How does the corruptible Body weigh down the Soul! When shall I be deliver'd from the Burden of this Flesh!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004447_0005_100D9D81D767BEB8"/>
Preached (never the less) <HI>thrice,</HI> and assisted in administring the <HI>Sacrament</HI> the same Day, without going to <HI>Sleep.</HI> God will make his Power to be known in me.—This Day 24 Years I was <HI>baptized.</HI> Lord, to what little Purpose have I lived! However, I seal'd my <HI>Baptismal Covenant</HI> with my dear <HI>Savi∣our's</HI> most blessed Body and Blood; and trust in his Strength I shall keep &amp; per∣form it. Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>SATURDAY <HI>Decem.</HI> 30. Preached <HI>nine</HI> times this Week, and expounded near <HI>eighteen</HI> times, with great Power &amp; En∣largement.—Blessed be God, I am every Moment imploy'd, from Morning till Midnight.—There's no End of People's coming and sending to me, and they seem more and more desirous, like <HI>new∣born Babes,</HI> to be <HI>fed with the sincere Milk of the Word.</HI></P>
<P>What a great Work has been wrought in the Hearts of many within this <HI>Twelve-Month!</HI> Now know I, that tho' <HI>Thou∣sands</HI> might come at first out of <HI>Curiosity,</HI> yet God has prevented &amp; quickned them by his free Grace. <HI>O that I could be humble and thankful!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004447_0006_100D9D85DE9E0EF8"/>
<HI>Glory be to God, that he fills me conti∣nually, not only with Peace, but also Joy in the Holy Ghost!</HI>—Before my Arri∣val, I thought I should <HI>envy</HI> my <HI>Brethrens Success</HI> in the Ministry, but blessed be God I rejoyce in it, and am glad to see Christ's Kingdom come, whatsoever <HI>In∣struments</HI> God shall make use of to bring it about.—Sometimes I perceive my self <HI>deserted</HI> for a little while, and much op∣press'd, especially before preaching, but <HI>Comfort</HI> soon after flows in.—<HI>The King∣dom of God is within me! O free Grace in Christ!</HI></P>
<P>SUNDAY, <HI>Decem.</HI> 31. Preached <HI>twice</HI> to large Congregations, especially in the Afternoon at <HI>Spittlefields.</HI> I had great <HI>Hoarsness</HI> upon me, and was <HI>deserted</HI> be∣fore I went into the Pulpit; but God <HI>strengthned</HI> me to speak, so as to be heard by all.</P>
<P>I despair'd of <HI>speaking</HI> much more that Night, my <HI>Cold</HI> being very great; but God enabled me to <HI>expound</HI> to <HI>two</HI> Companies in <HI>Southwark;</HI> and I was <HI>never</HI> more enlarged in Prayer in my whole Life.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004447_0007_100D9D89954ED198"/>
Those <HI>Words</HI> were much pressed upon my Soul, <HI>"And the Power of the Lord was present to heal them",</HI> and indeed I believe it was; for many were <HI>pricked to the Heart</HI> and <HI>felt</HI> themselves to be Sinners. <HI>O that all the World knew and felt that!</HI></P>
<P>MONDAY, <HI>Jan.</HI> 1. Received the <HI>Holy Sacrament,</HI> preached <HI>twice,</HI> and ex∣pounded <HI>twice;</HI> and found <HI>this</HI> to be the happiest <HI>New-Years-Day</HI> that I ever yet saw. Oh, what <HI>Mercies</HI> has the Lord shewn me since this Day <HI>Twelve Month!</HI> And yet I shall <HI>see</HI> greater Things than these! <HI>O that my Heart may be prepared to see 'em! O that my old Things may pass away and all Things become new!</HI>—Had a <HI>Love Feast</HI> with our <HI>Brethren</HI> at <HI>Fetter-Lane,</HI> and spent the <HI>whole Night</HI> in close <HI>Prayer, Psalms</HI> and <HI>Thanksgivings.</HI> God supported me without <HI>Sleep. O that our Despisers were Partakers of our Joys!</HI></P>
<P>TUESDAY, <HI>Jan.</HI> 2. Staid at <HI>Home</HI> to receive those who wanted to consult me.—Blessed be God, from <HI>seven</HI> in the Morning, till <HI>three</HI> in the Afternoon, Peo∣ple came; some telling me what God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="004447_0008_100D9D8B28CCEA70"/>
done for their Souls, and others crying out—<HI>"What shall we do to be saved?</HI> Being oblig'd to go out after this, I re∣ferr'd several till <HI>Thursday.</HI>—God ena∣bled me to give 'em Answers of <HI>Peace.</HI>—How does he work by my unworthy Hands! His Mercies melt me down, <HI>O that I were thankful!</HI></P>
<P>THURSDAY, <HI>Jan.</HI> 4. My <HI>Cold</HI> conti∣nued, and I fear'd it would <HI>prevent</HI> my Speaking, yet God enabled me to <HI>expound</HI> with extraordinary Power in a <HI>private Society;</HI> and then to <HI>preach</HI> at <HI>Wapping Chapel,</HI> so that the Word <HI>pierc'd</HI> the Hearers Souls! And afterward I ex∣pounded &amp; prayed for an Hour and half, with great Power and <HI>Demonstration of the Spirit,</HI> and my Heart was full of God.</P>
<P><HI>How immediately does Jesus Christ re∣ward me for my poor Services! as soon as my daily Work is done, he says, "Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord." He com∣mands, &amp; it is done.</HI></P>
<P>FRYDAY, <HI>Jan.</HI> 5. Held a <HI>Conferrence</HI> at <HI>Islington,</HI> concerning several Things of great <HI>Importance,</HI> with seven true Mi∣nisters of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> despised <HI>Methodists,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="004447_0009_100D9D8CBB1DB678"/>
whom God brought together from the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West, North</HI> and <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>What we were in <HI>Doubt</HI> about, after Prayer, we determined by <HI>Lot;</HI> and e∣very Thing was carried on with great Love, Meekness &amp; Devotion.—We continued in <HI>Fasting &amp; Prayer</HI> till <HI>three</HI> o' Clock, and then parted with a full Conviction that God was going to do great Things among us. <HI>Oh that we may be any ways Instrumental to his Glory! that he would make us Vessels pure and holy, meet for our Master's Use.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Expounded twice</HI> afterwards in <HI>London</HI> with great Power, and then was much enlarged for near an Hour in <HI>Prayer,</HI> in <HI>Fetter-Lane</HI> Society.—The <HI>Spirit of Sup∣plication</HI> increases in my Heart daily! May it increase ever, more and more.</P>
<P>I did not find the <HI>Pity</HI> I ought, upon seeing a <HI>Brother</HI> full of <HI>Self-love.</HI> LORD, <HI>inlarge my narrow Heart, and give me that Charity, which rejoyces not in Iniquity, but rejoyces in the Truth.</HI>—I perceived some∣thing a little bordering on <HI>Envy</HI> toward my Brother H.—I find more &amp; more that true <HI>Humility</HI> consists in being <HI>sub∣missive</HI> to those who are a <HI>little above</HI> or a little <HI>below</HI> us. <HI>"Oh when shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

to rejoyce in Others Gifts &amp; Graces, as much as in my own! I am resolved to wrestle with Jesus Christ, by Faith &amp; Prayer, till He thus blesses me.</HI></P>
<P>SATURDAY, <HI>Jan. 6. (Twelfth-Day)</HI> Preach'd <HI>six</HI> times this <HI>Week,</HI> and should a <HI>seventh,</HI> but a <HI>Minister</HI> would not <HI>permit</HI> me; which caus'd me to <HI>pray for him most earnestly. Blessed be God I can say, I love my Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Expounded <HI>twice</HI> or <HI>thrice</HI> every Night this Week. The <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> so power∣fully worked upon my <HI>Hearers,</HI> prick∣ing their Hearts, and melting them into such <HI>Floods</HI> of Tears, that a <HI>spiritual</HI> Man said, "He <HI>never</HI> saw the like before.</P>
<P>GOD is with me of a Truth. Adored be His unmerited Goodness, I find his Grace quickning me more &amp; more every Day.—My Understanding is more inlightened, my Affections more inflam∣ed, and my Heart full of Love towards God and Man.—<HI>O that the Scoffers of these last Days were not only almost, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> such as I am, except my Indwel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ruptions!</HI></P>

<P>"WOuld to GOD that <HI>Christmas,</HI> if it must be observed, were kept something after <HI>this Manner</HI> thro' all <HI>Christendom!</HI> And that <HI>Sabbaths</HI> were thus <HI>sanctified</HI> in the <HI>Church of England,</HI> or among <HI>Dissenters!</HI>—Not that I think ordinary <HI>Ministers</HI> or <HI>Christians</HI> called of God or able, to go <HI>these Lengths.
