<P>AS it was the sovereign Pleasure of the eternal God, to make of one Blood all Nations of Men for to dwell on all the Face of the Earth,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Act.</HI> 17. 26.</NOTE> so it was his Pleasure to choose the Nation of the Jews from among all other Nations to be a special People unto himself, above all the People that were upon the Face of the Earth.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>And having chosen them to be his peculiar People, he declared unto them his Covenant, which he com∣manded them to perform even ten Commandments, which he wrote on two Tables of Stone,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 4. 13.</NOTE> and deli∣vered unto <HI>Moses</HI> to transfer unto them.</P>
<P>This <HI>Moses</HI> he raised up from among them, to be their Prophet and King under him, and an eminent Instrument in his Hand of their Redemption and Deli∣verance
<PB N="2" REF="005173_0005_1016CFBB510A9838"/>
out of their Egyptian Bondage; and he con∣descended to speak to him Face to Face, as a Man speaketh to his Friend.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> 23. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>And <HI>Moses</HI> having received the Law from the Mouth and Hand of God, together with many Promises to allure, and Threatnings to awaken the People to Obe∣dience, read it in their Audience; and they upon hearing it, promised Obedience to it.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> 24. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>And <HI>he</HI> not shuning to declare unto them all the Counsel of God, approved himself faithful to God, and to his People, therefore God gave this Testimony concerning him; <HI>My Servant</HI> Moses <HI>is faithful in all my House,</HI> Numb. 12. 7.</P>
<P>In this Chapter we have a divine Song which <HI>Moses</HI> by the Help of God's Spirit composed for the Use and Benefit of the People of God who were then upon the Stage, and those that should arise after them; wherein he setteth forth the Mercy of God to allure them, and his Vengeance to awaken them to obey all his Com∣mandments, <HI>Ver.</HI> 1. <HI>to</HI> 45.</P>
<P>And having made an End of speaking all the Words of this Song, (and almost all he had to say unto them in the Name of the Lord, for the Time of his Depar∣ture was now at Hand.) He in <HI>Ver.</HI> 46. exhorted them,</P>
<P N="1">1. To set their Hearts unto all the Words which he had testified among them. He had shown them the Way of the Lord; the Religion they should choose, profess, practice and propagate in the World; and he would have them set their Hearts to it. <HI>Set your Hearts unto all the Words which I testify among you this Day.</HI> Let these Words reach and affect your Hearts, and engage them to the Duties of Religion, so that you may cheerfully and faithfully perform them.</P>
<P N="2">2. To teach their Children the Religion he had taught them, and to charge them to observe it. <HI>Ye</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="005173_0006_1016CFBF0A05CBC0"/>
<HI>shall teach your Children to observe to do all the Words of this Law,</HI> 'Twas not enough that they were reli∣gious themselves, but they should do what they could to make their Children so; that thereby Religion might be handed down to the latest Posterity.</P>
<P>And in this Verse of which my Text is a Part, he laboured to fasten these Words of Exhortation upon the People, with such Arguments as these; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. That which he had exhorted them unto was not a vain Thing for them to observe; <HI>For it is not a vain Thing for you.</HI> They might be ready to think (as some do now) that Religion is a vain Thing; that there is no Profit in it, and that they might prosper without it, as well as other Nations; but he would have them know and consider that it was no unprofitable Business, but of great Importance, and worthy of their most serious Care and Concern. For,</P>
<P N="2">2. It was their Life; <HI>because it is your Life,</HI> i.e. it is as necessary as your Life; as precious and profitable, and rather to be chosen than your Life. <Q>O that Men were fully possessed of this, that Religion is their Life, even the Life of their Souls!</Q><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry in Loco.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. It was the Way to preserve and prolong their natural and temporal Life in this World; <HI>through this Thing ye shall prolong your Days in the Land whether ye go over Jorden to possess it,</HI> i.e. by this Means, <HI>namely,</HI> the Practice of Religion according to God's Law, you shall prolong your Days in this World.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Moses</HI> the Man of God laboured to excite and stir up the People of God to study the Principles and perform the Duties of the holy Religion he had taught them, and to put their Children upon these Things.</P>
<P><HI>It is your Life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005173_0007_1016CFC1B91138F0"/>
From the Words I shall observe to you, this</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That Religion is the Life of God's People.</HI></P>
<P>In speaking to this I shall endeavour,
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) To shew you what Religion is in general.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) What that Religion is, which is the Life of God's People. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) Why it is called their Life.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. I am to show, <HI>What Religion is in general;</HI> or what we are to understand by it.</P>
<P>And here I shall say,</P>
<P>The Word <HI>Religion</HI> is derived from the Latin Word <HI>Religo,</HI> which signifieth to fasten or bind hard, and it is used for that Profession of Piety which a Man binds himself to observe, in the Practice of which he hopeth and expecteth to be saved. Salvation is that which all Men hope for who have any Sense of a future State of Weal and Wo; of Happiness and Misery; and every Man hopeth to be saved in the Religion he professeth. And therefore when a Man hath drank in any Religion, let it be never so false and vain, he is hardly brought off from it. Thus it was with the <HI>Athenians</HI> when the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> preach'd Christ and the Resurrection unto them. <HI>Act.</HI> 17. <HI>Ver.</HI> 16, 17, &amp;c.</P>
<P>II. I am to shew; <HI>What that Religion is, which is the Life of God's People.</HI></P>
<P>And here I shall say,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not every Religion that is professed in the World, in the Practice of which Men hope to be saved. And therefore mind; it is not the Religion of the <HI>Heathen</HI> or <HI>Pagan</HI> Nations; nor the Religion of the <HI>Mahomitans;</HI> neither is it the Religion of the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is not the Religion of the Heathen or Pagan Nations</HI> Their Religion, (as the Rev. Dr. <HI>Beveridge</HI> observes,
<PB N="5" REF="005173_0008_1016CFC49D3E2520"/>
in his excellent Thoughts on Religion) <Q>Is full of the most notorious Idolatry &amp; Superstition; for some there are among them that pay religious Worship to the Sun, &amp; some adore the Moon; and some the Stars▪ some there are that worship the Earth, and Mountains and Trees; others that worship Serpents and other living Creatures; some bow down to Images in the Fashion of Men, Women, and other Shapes: and some that pay Homage and Adoration to the Devil.</Q></P>
<P>This Religion tho' it be so vain, yet it hath spread <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> profes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the greatest Part of the World.</P>
<P>It prevails in several Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">As in <HI>Tartary, China,</HI> and <HI>India.</HI></NOTE> and in <HI>Affrica</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is of great Extent,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Especially in <HI>Guinea, Nubia, Ethiopia</HI> Inferior, and in the <HI>Affrican</HI> Islands, parti∣cularly <HI>Madagascar.</HI></NOTE> and in some Parts of <HI>America</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the professed Religion of the Natives.</P>
<P>Some by dividing the inhabited World into thirty Part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that nineteen of them are possessed by Hea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>▪<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gordon</HI>'s Geography. p. 425.</NOTE> Again;</P>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Religion of the Mahometans.</HI> Their Re∣ligion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over a great Part of the World, tho' it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> extensive as the other. It is called the Mahome∣tan Religion from one <HI>Mohomet</HI> an Arabian, who by the Assistance of one <HI>Sergius</HI> a Nestorian Monk, compiled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Book in the Arabian Tongue, and called it <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which he made the Rule of his Followers Life &amp; Man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, pretending that it was sent from Heaven to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Hand of the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Beveridge</HI>'s Thoughts on Religion.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Book tho' it promiseth no greater Happiness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sensible Pleasures to the obedient in the coming World, yet it hath gained great Credit in this World; for it is the established Religion in some Parts of <HI>Turky</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Particu∣larly in <HI>Greece,</HI> and in Little <HI>Tartary,</HI> the Inhabitants are for the most Part of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Profession; and in the <HI>Da∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> Provinces Mahomitanism is professed by many.</NOTE> and in several Parts of <HI>Asia</HI> it is the pro∣fessed

Religion of many People,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">As in <HI>Tartary, China,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> and other Places.</NOTE> And in <HI>Affrica</HI> it is the most prevailing Religion,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Particularly in <HI>Egypt, Barbary, Bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red, Zaara,</HI> and the <HI>Negro</HI> Land &amp;c.</NOTE> So that next to the pagan Religion it is of the greatest Extent.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P><HI>It is not the Religion which the Jews now profess.</HI> They were once the only Covenant People of God, and their Religion was the only true Religion in the World: The Principles of it are contained in the Book of the Law, called the old Testament; to which our Gospel is annexed. And this Book they say, (and we concur with them in it) was written by holy Men of God, im∣mediately inspired by the Holy Ghost, and therefore is not of human Invention, but of divine Institution.</P>
<P>But in as much as they rejected the <HI>Messiah,</HI> (our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ) who was prophesied of, and promised to them in the Book of the Law, and who came to them according to Promise, and offered him∣self to them to be their Saviour &amp; Redeemer, and would not accept of him, (<HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 11.) but by wicked Hands crucified and slew him; (<HI>Acts</HI> 2. 23.) They are now broken off from God's Covenant, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 20.) and re∣jected from being a People &amp; Kingdom by themselves, (tho' they were once a Nation and Kingdom of great Renown in the World) and are become a Proverb of Reproach, and a By-Word among all Nations whither they are driven; and their Religion is now become vain, and will not save them.</P>
<P>So that it is not every Religion which is professed in the World, in the Practice of which some hope to be saved, that is the Life of the People of God.</P>
<P>Therefore I shall say;—</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the true <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> and that only which is the Life of God's People.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005173_0010_1016CFCA5AA56558"/>
I say, <HI>the true Christian Religion,</HI> because all the Re∣ligion that goeth under the Name of Christian is not true; and all that call themselves Christians don't pro∣fess the true Christian Religion. Many gross Errors and Heresies, and pernicious Principles and Opinions are broached &amp; taught by Men who call themselves Christians. The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> abounds with such; and among Protestants there are too many; therefore I say, <HI>it is the true Christian Religion,</HI> and no other, which is the Life of God's People. The true Christian Religion hath the Lord Jesus Christ for it's Author and Object; and therefore derives it's Name from him, and it is contained in the Scriptures of the old and new Testa∣ment, called the holy Bible; wherein we are shewn who Jesus Christ is, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that he is the eternal and only begotten Son of God; the Brightness of his Father's Glory; and the express Image of his Person, and only Saviour of the World:</HI> And wherein, we have the History <HI>of his Birth and Education; of his Doctrine and Miracles; of his Sufferings and Death; of his Resurrection from the Dead, and Ascention into Heaven;</HI> where he ever liveth to make Intercession with God the Father on the Behalf of them that come unto God by him, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 25.</P>
<P>This Religion is the only safe Religion; and that in the Practice of which Salvation is to be hoped for upon good and sufficient Grounds; and it hath comparatively but few Vouchers; <HI>i. e.</HI> but few that profess it, and stand firmly by it.</P>
<P>The Christian Religion, if we consider it, in its largest Latitude, (for that which is true, and that which is false) spreads over but a small Part of the <HI>Globe.</HI> <Q>Some that have divided the inhabited World into thirty Parts, have found but five of the thirty to go under the Name of Christian.</Q> And if all that call them∣selves Christians, but yet don't profess the true Christian Religion, were set by themselves, how few would be left?</P>
<P>And having said that the true Christian Religion is the only Religion which is the Life of God's People;
<PB N="8" REF="005173_0011_1016CFCBE9C82EA8"/>
it may seem proper that I give you some distinguishing Marks and Characters of this Religion, (tho' all that might be said of it can't be now expected) whereby it may be discerned and known from that Religion which is not true Christian.</P>
<P>And here I shall say—</P>
<P N="1">1. The true Christian Religion teacheth us to own and acknowledge, the one only living and true God, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> to be the Object of religious Worship, and no other. Not <HI>Baal,</HI> not an Idol, nor any graven Image. As God said to the Chil∣dren of Israel (his ancient Covenant People) so he saith to us, Exod. 20. 3, 4, 5. <HI>Thou shalt have no other Gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven Image, or any Likeness of any Thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Waters under the Earth: Thou shalt not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.</HI></P>
<P>The Heathen, whose Religion is false and vain, have many vain Objects of religious Worship; their <HI>Idols are Silver &amp; Gold, the Works of Mens Hands,</HI> Psal. 135. 15. But the true Christian Religion hath no other Object of religious Worship than the one only living and true God; who is one in Essence, and three in Relations; the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> Mat. 28. 19.</P>
<P>And as the true Christian Religion hath the one only living and true God for the Object of religious Worship, and no other, so it teacheth Men to turn from their Idols which are Vanities, unto the living God, who made Hea∣ven and Earth, and the Sea, and all Things that are therein, (<HI>Act.</HI> 14. <HI>v.</HI> 15.) and to worship him, and him only with religious Worship, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 8, 9.</P>
<P>When the Devil impudently tempted our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to deny the God that is above, and to fall down and worship him, he rejected the Tempta∣tion with the greatest Abhorrence and Detestation, saying as in Mat. 4. 10. <HI>Get thee hence Satan, for it is written,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="005173_0012_1016CFCDDFD6DD18"/>
<HI>thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve:</HI> i. e. in a religious Manner, and with religious Worship.</P>
<P N="2">2. The true Christian Religion teacheth us to make the holy Word of God our Rule and Standard in all religious Affairs, and nothing else. Not the Laws of <HI>Heathens,</HI> not the Laws of <HI>Mahometans,</HI> nor the Laws of <HI>Christian</HI> Men. And every true Christian will look upon himself to be bound by it, for therein (and in no other Book) we are shewn what is Good, and what it is that God requires of us; how he is to be feared, loved, and served by us; and all that we should know, believe, and do; that we may enjoy his Favour here, and be happy with him forever, is therein recorded and revealed to us, <HI>Micah</HI> 6. 8. <HI>Deut.</HI> 10. 12, 13. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 16.</P>
<P>There we are told that we must repent of our Sins, and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and do good Works,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Acts 17. 30. 1 Joh. 3. 23.</NOTE> and that if we do these Things we shall be saved; but if we neglect them, we shall be damned.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Luk. 13. 3. Mar. 16. 16. and Rom. 2. 7, 8.</NOTE> We should therefore search the Scriptures, and adhere to them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5. 39. <HI>Isai.</HI> 34. 16.</P>
<P>When our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ sent forth his Disciples to spread and propagate the true Christian Religion, he did not leave them to their Liberty to teach what they would, and to give what Laws they pleased to the Church, but he charged them to teach the People to observe all those Things which he had com∣manded them, and nothing else, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19, 20.</P>
<P>And when they substituted others in their Room, they charged them to keep to the Word, to preach that and nothing else, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 2. For when Men turn from that they run wild in Religion, and bring Disorder and Confusion into the Church.</P>
<P>The Word of God is pure and perfect, true and righ∣teous altogether, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19. 7, 8, 9. It is holy, just, and
<PB N="10" REF="005173_0013_1016CFD1DED2ABB8"/>
good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 12. and therefore the more sure Word of Prophecy, whereunto every one should take heed, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 19. It is more sure than any Voice from Hea∣ven, Vision or Revelation, that any may pretend to; and if this be laid aside, we have no certain Rule for Religion, and must needs walk in Darkness.</P>
<P>Men are mutable and fallable, subject to Change and to err: they are of one Mind to Day and another to-Morrow; and if Religion were to be under their Di∣rection it would be as mutable and fallable as they, and change as they do; and there would be no certainty in it: therefore they are not fit to make Rules for the Re∣ligion of Christ.</P>
<P>Under the Dispensation of the Law many wicked Kings overthrew the true and pure Religion of God, and substituted a false Religion in the room of it. And the Scribes and Pharisees transgressed the Commandments of God by their own Traditions, on which Account our Saviour found Fault with them, and told them that their Worship was vain, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15. 3, 6, 9. And since the Promulgation of the Gospel, the true Christian Religion hath been overthrown in many Places by the Command∣ments of Men, and a false Religion substituted in the Place of it; and it will be always so if the Word of God be laid aside.</P>
<P N="3">3. The true Christian Religion teacheth us to have respect to all God's Commandments and Ordinances; and will not allow us to be partial in the Law, nor to turn aside to the right Hand or to the left. Deut. 5. 32. 33. <HI>Ye shall observe to do as the Lord your God hath command∣ed you; you shall not turn aside to the right Hand or to the left. You shall walk in all the Ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The true Christian Religion teacheth us to have a special and singular Regard to the Glory of God in all our religious Duties &amp; moral Actions. True Christians are created in Christ Jesus unto good Works, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 10. and will be zealous of them. <HI>Tit.</HI> 2 14. and as they have
<PB N="11" REF="005173_0014_1016CFD5E91BBA38"/>
Opportunity and Ability perform them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6. 9, 10. Not with any sinful View that they may have Praise of Men, but principally and chiefly, and above all Things, that God may be glorified by them, <HI>1 Cor.</HI> 10. 31.</P>
<P N="5">5. The true Christian Religion teacheth us to make our humble &amp; fervent Addresses to the God &amp; Father of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jesus Christ, for the bestowment of his Holy Spirit upon us; (which he hath graciously promised, and for which he will be inquired of by us, to bestow it on us, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36. 27, &amp; 37.) whereby we may be quick∣ned out of our spiritual Death, regenerated and sanctified, and made fit to be Partakers of that Inheritance of the Saints in Light: and without which all our Pretences to the true Christian Religion will prove empty &amp; vain. For if any Man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 9.</P>
<P N="6">6. The true Christian Religion teacheth us not to rely on any Works of Righteousness and Piety which we do, for the Justification of our Persons before God, and Salva∣tion of our Souls; but to acknowledge when we have done all those Things which are required of us, that we are unprofitable Servants, <HI>Luk.</HI> 17. 10.

<P>And having hinted to you these distinguishing Marks of the true Christian Religion; I shall now pass to the third and last Thing which I proposed under the Doctrine.</P>
<P>III. I am to shew you; <HI>Why Religion,</HI> i. e. <HI>the true Christian Religion, is called the Life of God's People.</HI></P>
<P>And here I shall say; (1) Because it is their temporal Life: (2) Their political Life: (3) Their spiritual Life: And (4) The Way to their Enjoyment of eter∣nal Life in the World to come.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="005173_0015_1016CFD8A61BF370"/>
1. The true Christian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <HI>because it is their temporal Life;</HI> that is, the Way and Means to preserve and prolong it▪ When <HI>Moses</HI> exhorted the People of God to set their Hearts to all the Words which he testified among them, and observe to do them, he told them that it was not a vain Thing for them, <HI>because it was their Life;</HI> and then he added, <HI>Through this Thing ye shall prolong your Days in the Land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</HI> By which he shews us, that to be truly religious is a singu∣lar Means to preserve and prolong our temporal Life in this World. Such Godliness hath the Promise of the Life that now is, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 8. God hath said to the Wicked, <HI>they shall not live out half their Days,</HI> Psal. 55. 23. But to the truly religious he hath said; <HI>with long Life will I satisfy him; and shew him my Salvation,</HI> Psal. 91. 16. They have Life in the Promise of God, (and that is wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Wicked have not) and while they live they experi∣ence the Faithfulness of God in performing his Promise to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The true Christian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <HI>because it is their political or civil Life;</HI> or their Life as a civil Government (whether Kingdom or Province) and they can't well, nor long subsist without it. It is this that exalteth a Nation; that makes it honourable in the Eyes of God, and famous &amp; renowned among other Nations, <HI>Prov.</HI> 14. 34. And it is this that is the Defence of a Nation, Kingdom, or Province. As it is said of Wisdom, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7. 12. It is a <HI>Defence;</HI> so it may be said of the true Christian Religion, it is a De∣fence; for while it is preserved in its Power and Purity among the People of God, God is with them to protect and preserve them. See 2 Chron. 15. 2.—<HI>Hear ye me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sa, and all Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you while ye be with him.</HI> And on this Account they may sing with the Church, as in Psal. 46. 1, 2. <HI>God is our Refuge and Strength, a very present Help in Trouble, therefore will not we fear &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005173_0016_1016CFDA51CE1718"/>
It went well with the Nation of the Jews so long as they adhered to the true Religion, and they were famous and renowned in the Eyes of the Nations round about them: But when they declined, then they become con∣temptible in the Eyes of other Nations, and were sorely punished and broken by the just Judgment of God upon them; as you may see in the History of their Kingdom.</P>
<P N="3">3. The true Christian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <HI>because it is their spiritual Life;</HI> or the Life of their precious and immortal Souls: without this their Souls are dead, even while their Bodies are alive, and will die eternally.</P>
<P>As the Body without the Spirit is dead, so the Soul without true Religion is dead also; that is, spiritually dead; dead in Trespasses and Sins; as the Apostle told the Ephesians they were before they embraced the true Christian Religion, Eph. 2.1. <HI>You hath he quickned who were dead in Trespasses and Sins:</HI> i. e. You who were void and destitute of the true Christian Religion, and so of a Principle of spiritual Life; hath he quickned. <Q>The Word <HI>quickned</HI> importeth a restoring of spiritual Life, by the infusion of a vital Principle (in the Work of Regeneration) whereby Men are enabled to walk with God in newness of Life;</Q> to fear him and love him, and serve him, and delight in a careful Observa∣tion of all his Commandments and Ordinances, which in∣deed is the most pleasant and comfortable Life that we can live in this World; for while we live such a Life, we may say with the Apostle, as in Phil. 3. 20. <HI>Our Conversation is in Heaven &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The true Christian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <HI>because it is the Way to their enjoy∣ment of eternal Life and Happiness in the World to come.</HI> Our Saviour said, Joh. 17. 3. <HI>This is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent:</HI> i. e. this Knowledge is the Way to eternal Life, and without it Men will mistake the Way, and miss of it. The Knowledge of God, and of Jesus
<PB N="14" REF="005173_0017_1016CFDCFAC5F5A0"/>
Christ, is an essential Part of the true Christian Religion, and the Way to be happy for ever; for such Godliness hath the Promise of the Life which is to come; not from any Meritoriousness in it, but from the free Grace of God, which hath annexed to it the Promise of eternal Life, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 8.</P>
<P>Thus I have shewn you, on what Account the true Christian Religion, may be called the Life of God's People.</P>
<P>And now I shall proceed to make some Improvement of this Doctrine in a few Words.</P>
<P>USE I. This Doctrine shews us that such as make a Profession of Religion, should examine the Religion they profess, and see whether it be the true Christian Religion.</P>
<P>There are many Religions in the World (as you have heard) and yet but one true Religion that will lead a Man to Heaven; so that tho' some of all Nations shall be saved, yet not some of all Religions; and therefore every Man should examine his Religion, and not take it up upon Trust as some do, saying they believe as the Church believes, and can give no other Account of their Religion.</P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> directs us to prove all Things, and to hold fast that which is good, 1 <HI>Thes</HI> 5. 21. that is, to try all Doctrines and Opinions in Religion which are delivered by any for Truths. And we are not to be∣lieve every Thing we hear 'till we have made trial of it. 1 Joh. 4. 1. <HI>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God, because many false Prophets are gone out into the World.</HI></P>
<P>Q. What are we to try the Spirits by; or the Doc∣trines which Men teach for Truths?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the Word of God, which is the Standard of Truth. Gal. 4. 30. <HI>What saith the Scripture?</HI> Isai. 8. 20, <HI>To the Law and to the Testimony, if they speak not accord∣ing</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="005173_0018_1016CFDEA6ACECB8"/>
<HI>to this Word, it is because they have no Light in them.</HI> The Word of God is a sure Rule, a safe Rule, and a sufficient Rule, whereunto we do well that we take heed; (2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 19.) And to this every Man should bring his Creed, and try every Article of his Faith, and hold fast that which is good; for then is his Religion true when it agreeth with the Rule of Truth, which is the Word of God. The <HI>Bereans</HI> were commended for their Care to try the Apostles Doctrine by the Scriptures of Truth, <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 11.</P>
<P>USE. II. This Doctrine shews us that the true Christian Religion should be dear to us as our natural Life, yea, and more too, because it is our spiritual Life, or the Life of our Souls, and the Way to eternal Life.</P>
<P>The Life of our Body is more precious to us than all our worldly Enjoyments: <HI>Skin for Skin; yea, all that a Man hath will he give for his Life,</HI> Job 3. 4. But the true Religion which is the Life of our Soul, should be more precious to us than the Life of our Body, and we should chuse rather to part with our natural Life, than with our holy Religion, for if we lose this we lose our Souls.</P>
<P>Profane History gives us many Examples of this Na∣ture, and in the holy Word of God we read of many who chose to suffer the Loss of their Possessions, yea, and of their Lives to, rather than part with their holy Religion. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 35, 36, 37.</P>
<P>The Disciples of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ forsook all they had for him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19. 27. And <HI>Ste∣phen,</HI> a Man full of Faith &amp; of the Holy Ghost suffered Death for his Sake, <HI>Acts</HI> 7. 59. And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> willingly suffered the Loss of all Things, rather than he would forsake Christ, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 8. And if we would be his Disciples, we must when he calls us to it forsake all to follow him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14. 33.</P>
<P>There is no worldly Thing that we should be so much concerned for as the Religion of Christ. Tho' there are some, who (<HI>Gallio</HI> like) care not for the Religion of
<PB N="16" REF="005173_0019_1016CFE2A6E250B0"/>
Christ, and others who speak and write against it, and persecute the Professors of it, and do all that they can to beat it down and destroy it; yet it should be dearer to us than our Lives▪ And above all Things we should be concerned to promote and preserve it in the World, and to hand it down to Posterity, that the Generations to come may profess and practice it, and have the Bene∣fit and Comfort of it.</P>
<P>USE III. This Doctrine shews us the Vanity and Madness of such as slight and despise, and set Light by the true Christian Religion, and go about to establish a Religion of their own Invention.</P>
<P>This is the Way and Manner of some Men; they don't see thro' the Religion which God hath instituted and revealed in his Word, therefore they despise it, and set up a Religion of their own Invention, and will not submit to any other than that which is the Product of their own (depraved) Reason and Understanding.</P>
<P>God never designed humane Reason to be the Rule of his Religion, but his own Word &amp; Law; and that Man that hath no other Rule for his Religion than his own natural Reason and Understanding, is no better of it than the Heathen, and stands no fairer for Heaven than they do.</P>
<P>Humane Reason is good in its Place, and when under proper Regulation useful in Religion; but it can never contrive a Religion that will lead a Man to Heaven.</P>
<P>Who will not acknowledge that <HI>Adam,</HI> when he had fallen from God's Favour and Fellowship, had as much humane Reason as any of his Posterity? And did he know how to restore himself into his Favour and Fel∣lowship again? No verily; he had no Notion of this: therefore instead of contriving a Religion to save him∣self by▪ he endeavoured to hide himself from the Pre∣sence of the Lord among the Trees of the Garden; <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 8. And they act as ignorantly who think to contrive a Religion of their own whereby they may be saved; and set Light by the Religion which God hath revealed;
<PB N="17" REF="005173_0020_1016CFE86FBB9EA8"/>
in the Belief and Practice of which alone we may on good Ground expect Salvation.</P>
<P>USE IV. This Doctrine should put us upon a serious Reflection on the State of our holy Religion at this Day; and excite us to consider whether it be in a reviving or dying Condition.</P>
<P>That there hath been a few Years past, a remarkable Revival of the true Christian Religion in some Towns in this Country, is very evident &amp; manifest to the Teachers of it, and many others: and it well becometh us to give God the Praise and Glory of his Grace in reviving his Work as he hath done in one Place and another.</P>
<P>And while we are thankful for this, we have Cause to lament before him that there are such different Opi∣nions with respect to the State of Religion, both among Ministers and People.</P>
<P>Some call it a Time of great Reformation at this Day; others; a Time of great Delusion and Giddiness; and little Reformation.</P>
<P>Some rejoyce that the Work of God is carried on gloriously: others tremble, fearing lest Satan be let loose, and suffered to delude many, both Ministers and People.</P>
<P>Some say that the itenerant Preachers, who have been travelling into many Towns in the Country of late, have been the happy Instruments of rousing many out of their carnal Security and of reforming their Lives. <HI>Others</HI> say they are wandering Stars, and that some of them impart no Light; that their travelling from Place to Place hath been the Occasion of much Confusion and Disorder in the Worship of God, and such Censorious∣ness in some Places, as is inconsistent with the true Christian Religion; and by Means of them some Chur∣ches, where there was Peace and Holiness flourishing, have been sorely rent and broken with Divisions.</P>
<P>Some say that illiterate Men (such it may be, as never learnt the Assembly's Catechism, nor can give any tol∣lerable Account of the Doctrine of our Justification be∣fore
<PB N="18" REF="005173_0021_1016CFEAC7D4E5E8"/>
God, which is as <HI>Luther</HI> well observes, <HI>Articulas stantis vel cadentis Ecclesiae,</HI>) who pretend to an imme∣diate, and inward Call from the Spirit of God to ex∣hort others, and to invite them to come unto Christ; have the Power of God, and that the Holy Spirit works by them for the Conviction, Conversion, and Comfort of many.</P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> say that such Men are unqualified &amp; uncalled, and undertake this Work out of the Pride of their own Hearts, and to gratify their own Lust.—That the Mini∣stry of the Word is a sacred Office, not to be invaded by private Men, whether learned or unlearned, under the Pretence of an inward and immediate Call to it: That none are to meddle in it, but such as are qualified for it, and externally and regularly called to it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. 5. 4. Rom. 10. 15.</NOTE>; That these Men run before they are sent, as the false Prophets did of old;<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jer. 23. 21.</NOTE> And as the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, some shall do in Gospel Times;<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 2. 1.</NOTE> And by Means of such Men the sacred Scriptures are most injuriously wrested, the Peace and Order of the Churches disturbed; and a great many Errors and Mistakes introduced. Satan hath filled the Church and World with Errors &amp; Trou∣bles this Way; saith an excellent Divine, namely Mr. <HI>Flavel.</HI> Again,</P>
<P>Some have a fond Regard to Voices, Visions, and Revelations, and countenance and encourage them, as if the Mind and Will of God were to be known by them▪ There were some such in the beginning of the Reformation by <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> and these Men <Q>were so intangled with certain enthusiastical Snares, that they thought it the highest Impiety to renounce them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> have no Regard at all to Voices, Visions and Revelations, and shew them no Countenance; but say, that God who at sundry Times, and in divers Manners,
<PB N="19" REF="005173_0022_1016CFED51EB4F90"/>
spake in Times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last Days spoken to us by his Son, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 1, 2.) whom we should hear, (<HI>Mat.</HI> 17. 5) and that we are to look for no Revelations but what he hath made to us in his Word: <HI>Indeed we need no more.</HI> As for Voices, Visions, Revelations, and Impulses, many have been deceived by them; but as for what Christ has revealed it deceiveth none; but is sufficient to make Men wise unto Salvation thro' Faith which is in Christ Jesus, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 15.</P>
<P><HI>Luther</HI> upon Occasion said, the Scripture is so full that as for Visions and Revelations <HI>nec curo, nec desidero,</HI> I neither regard nor desire them. And when he him∣self had a Vision of Christ, (after a Day of Fasting and Prayer) he cried out, <HI>Avoid Satan,</HI> I know no Image of Christ but the Scriptures. Again,</P>
<P>Some say that Exclamations and Faintings on the Account of extraordinary Sorrow for Sin, or Joy in the Holy Ghost, in publick Assemblies, or more private Meeting for the Worship of God, is a Sign of the gra∣cious Presence of God, and of the Effusion of his Holy Spirit upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> say it is Breach of that Order and Decency which the Spirit of God hath directed us to observe in our religious Assemblies for his Worship, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 40.</P>
<P>Some say that Divisions and Seperations in the Chur∣ches, have a great Tendency to promote true Religion in them at this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> say, that we have no such Direction in the holy Scriptures; and that it is a Sign of the dying State of Religion; that the Scriptures caution Christian Chur∣ches against Divisions &amp; Seperations among themselves; and exhort them all to speak the same Thing, and to be perfectly joined together in the same Mind, and in the same Judgment; and to endeavour to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 10. and <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="005173_0023_1016CFAAEB5CD868"/>
Thus we are divided and broken, when we should be all united, and in one Mind, being Members of one Body in Christ, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 5.) and Professors of one and the same true Christian Religion.</P>
<P>And there being such Division among us, what shall we say with Respect to the State of our holy Religion at this Day? May we conclude that it is reviving, or dying?</P>
<P>I am perswaded that it is to be acknowledged, with the greatest Thankfulness to Almighty God, that in some Places there are evident Tokens of the Effusion of his Holy Spirit for the revival of Religion among us at this Day.</P>
<P>And we should esteem it so, there, <HI>where</HI> the Word of God is more remarkably quick and powerful in the publick Ministry of it than usual in our publick Assem∣blies; <HI>where</HI> there is a wonderful shaking among the dry Bones, and many that have been for a long Time dead in Trespasses and Sins, appear to be made alive to God; <HI>where</HI> sleepy Sinners are awakened; stubborn Sinners subdued; proud Sinners humbled; carnal Wretches made spiritual; covetous Worldlings made liberal; Drunkards made temperate; and unclean Per∣sons made chaste: <HI>Where</HI> profane Swearers, by the dread∣ful Name of God, now fear his glorious &amp; fearful Name: <HI>Where</HI> those that lived unmindful of Heaven, now seek the Things which are above, and set their Affections upon them: <HI>Where</HI> those that lived prayerless Lives, now call upon God; and those that despised his Word now trem∣ble at it: <HI>Where</HI> many that had no Sight nor Sense of their Sins, and of the wretched and miserable State they are in by Nature, are now pricked in their Heart, and cry out saying, <HI>What must we do to be saved? Where,</HI> many that turned their Backs upon the Table of the Lord, and said (practically at least) the Table of the Lord is contemptible, do now hunger &amp; thirst for Com∣munion with Christ there; and <HI>where,</HI> Additions are made to the Church daily; and true Christian Charity, Peace, and Unity, with Holiness, doth flourish; there
<PB N="21" REF="005173_0024_1016CF9F892B7920"/>
Religion is reviving; and that it is so in some Places, is to be acknowledged to the Praise and Glory of God.</P>
<P>But alas, how is it in some other Places? It is to be spoken with Lamentation, that Religion is in a lan∣guishing and dying Condition, and reduced to a low Ebb, in some Places. It is so in such Places, <HI>where</HI> the Peo∣ple are settled on their Lees, are at Ease in Zion, and unconcerned for the Salvation of their Souls; <HI>where</HI> they that have been filthy are filthy still; that have been unjust are unjust still; they that have been prayerless, are prayerless still; and they that have lived in the Neglect of the holy Duties of Religion, and in the Practice of scandalous Immoralities, are unhum∣bled and unreformed to this Day: <HI>where</HI> there are none that stir up themselves to take hold on God, and the Ways of <HI>Zion</HI> mourn, because none cometh to the solemn Feasts; and <HI>where</HI> there are such lamentable Seperati∣ons, Confusions, and Censoriousness, as plainly shew that God is departing from them: In such Places, Religion is in a dying Condition. And is not this the Case in some of our Towns?</P>
<P>USE V. This Doctrine should excite and stir up all such as make a Profession of the true Christian Religion, to take heed and beware lest Satan deceive them, and so at last they should prove counterfeit Christians. 2 Cor. 2. 11. <HI>Lest Satan should get an Advantage of us.</HI></P>
<P>There is Danger of this, and every one should be jealous of himself, and fear lest he should be deceived. The Pharisee was deceived, (<HI>Luk.</HI> 18. 11.) and the Lao∣diceans were deceived, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 17. And it is common for Men to be deceived with respect to the State and Condition of their Souls.</P>
<P>Some that pretend much to Religion, and the Spirit of God, do many Times give sufficient Reason to fear a counterfeit Work: And indeed it is no wonder if many should prove counterfeit Christians, and reprobate Silver, in such a Time as this, when Religion is so much talked of, and professed in one Place and another.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="005173_0025_1016B84FCC7C55B8"/>
The best Things on Earth may be counterfeited; as <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold,</HI> and precious <HI>Jewels;</HI> and so may the best Things of the Spirit of God, as <HI>Faith, Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Holiness.</HI> We are not to take every Thing for Gold that looks like it, nor every Thing for the Work of God's Spirit that hath a Shew of it. They are not al∣ways the best that would appear to be so.</P>
<P>Satan who transforms himself into an Angel of Light, (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 14.) is doubtless now at Work, and useth his hellish Policy to counterfeit the Works of God's Spirit in many, and how near he may mimick them is hard to determine: He may do much this Way to the Delusion of many Souls, if God permits him.</P>
<P>We may not think the Time is now come wherein he is bound, and shall hurt no more; or that he now sleepeth, when his Kingdom shaketh in many Places, and seems to be coming down apace; but we should fear lest he get an Advantage of us, and pray earnestly that he may be bruised under our Feet; and lament those Things which have a Shew of his Foot, and give us Reason to fear that he is suffered to delude some un∣wary Persons to the everlasting Ruin of their precious Souls.</P>
<P>I shall now pass to the sixth and last Use.</P>
<P>USE. VI. This Doctrine shews us, that we should all do what we can, in the several Places and Stations God hath set us in, for the Preservation and Promotion of that Religion which is our Life.</P>
<P>There is much to be done for it, and something may be done by every one that maketh a Profession of it. Therefore I shall address Persons of every Order and Degree, to put forth their helping Hand for the Pro∣motion of our holy Religion. And here,</P>
<P>I. Let me address <HI>civil Magistrates;</HI> or such as God hath promoted to the Seats of civil Government, to do what they can to promote the Religion of Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="005173_0026_1016CF704B205BB0"/>
<HI>Honoured Patriots!</HI> Let it not seem a small Thing to you, that you have the true Christian Religion to pro∣tect and defend, but esteem it as a very great Honour conferred upon you, and Trust reposed in you by him, <HI>by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice; by whom Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8. 15, 16.</NOTE> and labour to approve your selves faithful to him, and to his Religion.</P>
<P>Thô the Religion of Christ may subsist without the Assistance of civil Magistrates, (as it hath done, yea, and even then when civil Magistrates opposed it, and laboured to beat it down and destroy it,) yet such Men have been very helpful to promote it. And as they have Power and Authority, so they should improve it for that End.</P>
<P>There are several Ways in and by which civil Ma∣gistrates may very much promote the Religion of Christ. Give me leave to mention a few.</P>
<P>They may do it—</P>
<P>By their earnest and fervent Prayers to almighty God, thrô Jesus Christ, for the Preservation of it, in its Life, Power, and Purity.</P>
<P>By their holy and religious Examples; and wise Coun∣sels in such difficult and perplexing Cases as the Mini∣sters of it may be concerned in, and ask their Counsel about. And</P>
<P>By enacting and executing such Laws as have a ten∣dency thereunto. Thus they may promote the Religion of Christ.</P>
<P>Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ hath clothed them with Power to <HI>enact</HI> and <HI>execute</HI> Laws for the Preserva∣tion of his Religion. Here mind—</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Civil Magistrates may enact Laws for the promo∣ting and preserving the true Christian Religion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005173_0027_1016CF73D5229178"/>
They may not make Laws against it, to beat it down and destroy it, for they have received no such Power from Christ, by whom they rule and govern Men: They as well as others are under that Tie, 2 Cor. 13. 8. <HI>We can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth.</HI> They may not hinder the free Course of Religion, nor make Laws for the Rule of it; for this, Christ who is the Head of the Church, and Author of Religion, hath done already, and exhibited them in his Word.</P>
<P>But they may add a civil Sanction and Strength of Law, for the strengthning and aiding the Exercise of Religion, and securing those divine Rights and Privi∣ledges which Christ hath given to his Church, and to oblige Men to submit to the Laws of Christ, so far at least as to make no Disturbance in the Church, and by doing so they may promote the Religion of Christ.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Rivet</HI> saith; <Q>The civil Magistrate is neither to administer the Word, nor Sacraments, nor Church Discipline &amp;c. but he is to take Care that all these Things be done by those whom God hath called thereunto.</Q><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rivet</HI> on the Decalogue, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P>And we find that the wise and pious Magistrates of old, took special Care to preserve the Life of their holy Religion, by preserving to the Church those Rights and Priviledges which God had given to it. And when impious Kings had taken them from the Church, they restored them to her again: Thus did <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Josiah,</HI> who were Kings of <HI>Judah:</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Kin.. 18. 3. a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Chap. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 2▪</NOTE> and so they were nursing Fathers to the Church of God, and did that which was right in the Sight of the Lord,<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">2 C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n. 29. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE></P>
<P>Civil Magistrates may promote Colleges and Schools of Learning, and provide learned and well qualified Teachers for them. They may take Care also that Churches be provided with able, orthodox, and godly
<PB N="25" REF="005173_0028_1016CF75795F6C78"/>
Ministers, and that their Maintenance be honourable and sufficient: Thus did that pious and excellent King <HI>Hezekiah.</HI> See 2 Chron. 31. 4. <HI>He commanded the Peo∣ple that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the Portion of the Priests and of the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the Law of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>In the 25th Article of the Confession of Faith of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> it is said,</P>
<Q><P>To Kings, Princes, Rulers and Magistrates, we affirm that principally and chiefly the Purgation and Conservation of Religion appertains, so that not only they are appointed for civil Policy, but also for Main∣tenance of the true Religion, and for the Suppression of all Superstition whatsoever. And</P>
<P><HI>Calvin, Zanchius,</HI> and <HI>Polanus,</HI> hold that the Christian Magistrate, his Office as concerning Religion, is dili∣gently to take Care that in his Dominion or Kingdom, Religion from the pure Word of God, expounded by the Word of God itself, and understood according to the Principles of Faith, (which others call the analogy of Faith) be either instituted, or (being in∣stituted) kept pure; or being corrupted, be restored, and reformed: That false Doctrines, Abuses, Idols, and Superstitions be taken away, to the Glory of God, and to his own and his Subjects Salvation.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gillespie</HI>'s Aaron's Rod. p. 259.</NOTE></P></Q>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Civil Magistrates may execute such Laws as have a Tendency to promote and preserve the Religion of Christ among the People of God; and inflict those Punishments on Offenders which the Law appoints.</HI> For they are by the Appointment of God to execute Wrath upon them that do Evil. Rom. 13. 4. <HI>He is the Minister of God, a Revenger,</HI> (or Officer) <HI>to execute Wrath,</HI> (or Punishment) <HI>upon him that doth Evil.</HI></P>
<P>The civil Magistrate is <HI>Custos et vindex utrius{que} Tabulae,</HI> and ought to preserve the first &amp; second Table of God's
<PB N="26" REF="005173_0029_1016CF7730628150"/>
<HI>moral Law</HI> (which is binding to all Nations) from being trampled upon by Men of profligate &amp; debauch'd Lives, and to punish such as openly dishonour God, by trans∣gressing either of them; and by doing so they may very much promote the Religion of Christ, which is greatly endangered by the vicious Practices of ungodly Men.</P>
<P>And having spoken these Things to civil Magistrates in general, I shall now be more particular.—</P>
<P><HI>May it please your Excellency;</HI></P>
<P>Your Excellency hath observed that the Design and Drift of this Discourse hath been to promote and pre∣serve the Life of that Religion which is the <HI>political</HI> as well as <HI>temporal</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> Life of a Christian People.</P>
<P>And now in your great Clemency &amp; Goodness, you'l accept an Address from the Desk, by the Hand of One who is sensible of his Unfitness (on any Account) to address a Gentleman of your superiour <HI>Learning, Wis∣dom, Honour</HI> and <HI>Skill,</HI> not only in civil, but also in religious Matters.</P>
<P>All that I shall ask of your <HI>Excellency</HI> is your Favour for that Religion, the Life of which hath been pleaded for: And this I trust you will upon all proper Occasions discover; it being the Religion of our <HI>most gracious Sovereign King GEORGE</HI> the Second; whose Life, we hope, is precious in the Sight of God, (and who to the general Satisfaction of the People of this Province hath appointed you their <HI>Governour;</HI>) the Religion of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> your <HI>own</HI> Religion; and the Religion of the People of your Charge; yea, and of all true Protestants in the World.</P>
<P>Your benign and kind Acceptance of the Address presented by the Body of the Clergy of this Province, when they were met the last Year, and the Assurance you then gave them of your Favour and Protection: And also your wise and mild Conduct since you have
<PB N="27" REF="005173_0030_1016CF7A62A80A30"/>
been in the <HI>Chair,</HI> in the Management of our civil Affairs; the very worthy Deeds that have been done by you for this Province, to the great Joy and Ease of the People; your Care that they may live quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godliness and Honesty: (and many other Things that might be mentioned with Thankfulness) emboldeneth us to expect that you will always endeavour to preserve the Life of our holy Reli∣gion, which is as dear to us as our Lives.</P>
<P>And now let me turn my self to the honourable Gen∣tlemen of the Council:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Honours;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Seeing you make a visible Profession of the true Christian Religion, and have the Character of religious Men; I doubt not but that you will appear on the Side of Religion; be concerned for it; and do what you can to preserve and promote it, in the honourable Station God hath set you in. You'l be advising and assisting every Way, and upon all Occasions; and encouraging every Thing that may serve to promote, and preserve that Religion which is the Life of this People, your own Life, and the Life of your Posterity.</P>

<P>And now to the honourable House of Representatives, who have called me, (thô unworthy) to this Service, I shall take the Liberty to say;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You are met together this Day, (thrô the kind Hand of God upon you) by Virtue of the Authority given in our <HI>Royal Charter,</HI> to choose <HI>Counsellers</HI> for this <HI>Pro∣vince,</HI> and to do those Things which the Good &amp; Safety of this <HI>Privince</HI> calls for.</P>
<P>You can't but know that it is your Duty to lay aside all by and sinister Ends and Views in your Elections,
<PB N="28" REF="005173_0031_1016CF7F9570D0B8"/>
and to choose out of all the People, <HI>able Men, such as fear God, Men of Truth, hating Coveteousness.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Exod. 18. 21.</NOTE> Your Election of such Men will be for your Honour, and the Comfort of this People.</P>
<P>You are also to look into the State of this Province, and to have a tender Regard not only to our <HI>civil</HI> but also to our <HI>religious</HI> Interest, and to do what you can to promote them both.—And as by your Conference one with another, you get the Knowledge of our <HI>civil</HI> State; so you may of the State of <HI>Religion,</HI> (which you should lay to Heart, and exemplify in your Lives:) And then you may consider what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to be done for Religion; and whether you are not called of God to put forth your Power to protect and promote it: And particularly, to guard and defend the Characters of the good &amp; faithful Ministers of it, against the unchristian Treatment many of them meet with at this Day.</P>
<P>Having thus addressed the honourable Magistracy; I shall now turn my self to the Reverend Ministers of our holy Religion.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>II. Let me address you; my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, who are Ministers of the true Christian Re∣ligion; <HI>Reverend and Beloved;</HI> Let us esteem it, not as a small Thing that the God of Israel, hath seperated us from the Congregation of Israel, to bring us near unto himself, to do the Service of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the Con∣gregation, to preach the Religion of Christ, and to minister unto them in holy Things;<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Numb. 16. 9.</NOTE> But let us ac∣count it a great Honour conferred upon us by Jesus Christ, (the Head and Saviour of the Church) and see to it that we honour him in this honourable Service, by doing all we can to preserve and promote his Religion, and to hand it down to Posterity.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="005173_0032_1016CF828E282928"/>
To this End, let us study to shew our selves approved unto God, Work-men that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2. 15.</NOTE> And let us be at Peace among our selves; Love as Brethren, and have fervent Charity one for another; and if it be possible speak the same Mind, and be perfectly joined together in the same Time, and in the same Judgment; <HI>for if the Shepherds are divided, the Sheep will be scattered.</HI></P>
<P>Let us keep up our Association Meetings, and fre∣quently meet together to strengthen one another's Hands, and to encourage one another's Hearts in the Work of God, and to strive together in our holy, humble, and fervent Prayers to Almighty God, thrô Jesus Christ, for the Life of our holy Religion, which is in Danger of dying from among us; and say as in Hab. 3. 2. <HI>O Lord, revive thy Work.</HI> And as in <HI>Psal.</HI> 90. 16. <HI>Let thy Work appear unto thy Servants, and thy Glory unto their Children.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord Jesus Christ charged the Angel of the Church of <HI>Sardis</HI> to be watchful, and strengthen the Things which remained, that were ready to die, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 2. And the same Charge lieth upon all the Angels of his Churches at this Day, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Pastors &amp; Teachers of them; and they must be watchful and do what they can to strengthen the Religion of Christ.</P>
<P><HI>My Brethren,</HI> There never was a Time since the Churches of Christ were planted in <HI>America,</HI> wherein Watchfulness and Patience, Prudence and Courage were more necessary for the Ministers of them than now.</P>
<P>There is, (doubtless) a good Work of God going on in the Country, his Spirit is evidently poured out upon many in one Place and another, which calls for our most grateful and thankful Acknowledgement unto him.</P>
<P>And there is, (doubtless) an evil Work of Satan going on in the Country, even there where the good Work
<PB N="30" REF="005173_0033_1016CF84CECD1BB8"/>
of God is going on; (as it was in the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> when the Spirit of God was remarkably poured out up∣on many: and as it was in <HI>Pargamos</HI> where Christ had a Church, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 22.) which calls for our Humiliation. But for me to say so, may be grievous to the Minds of some, who would have all the Noise &amp; Stir, the strange Agitations and Motions, Screaming and Fainting, and Disorders, that are grievous and offensive to many godly Persons, attributed to the pouring out of God's Spirit upon his People, and will not allow of any Delusion in such Things.</P>
<P>But this (I trust) is not the general Opinion of either Ministers or People. The most are for distinguishing the genuine and proper Works of God's Spirit, from the counterfeit and delusive Works of Satan: And if this Method were complied with and wisely managed by all, Peace and Holiness, with good Order, might be pre∣served and promoted where it is, and restored where it is wanting.</P>
<P>What a sad Condition is Religion running into in some of our Towns (by Means of Satan, and the Lusts of Men,) where Censoriousness, and the Train of Evils which attend that unchristian Spirit, (as Divisions, Sepe∣rations, Disorders and Confusions) lamentably prevail?</P>
<P>And many would have it so; therefore they refuse to be healed, when healing Methods are prescribed.—How often have we such melancholy Accounts from one Place and another?</P>
<P>The Time is now come when many of the true and faithful, pious and laborious Ministers of our holy Reli∣gion, (though they should be esteemed very highly in Love for their Works sake,<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. 5. 13.</NOTE> yet are insulted by some as <HI>Korah</HI> and his Companions insulted <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> saying, <HI>Ye take too much upon you,</HI> Numb. 16. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="005173_0034_1016CF880226A8C0"/>
Some ignorant and mean, vile and base Men, will now proclaim themselves converted, thô they can't give any Scripture Proof of it, nor do they shew it in their Conversation. And if we labour to shew them their Mistake, and tell them what is lacking; they'l presently pronounce us <HI>carnal, unconverted,</HI> and <HI>Opposers of God's Work.</HI> And this they are encouraged to do, by the Example of some Persons of an ecclesiastical Character, who have thus reproached (contrary to the 5th &amp; 9th Commandment) some of our most learned and pious Fathers and Brethren in the Ministry, who have truly preached Christ, and shewn unto Men the Way of Sal∣vation by him; and by their humble, holy, peaceable, and blameless Lives, have shown themselves to be the true Followers of Christ.</P>
<P>Under such a Trial, let that Word of Christ comfort us, Mat. 5. 11, 12. <HI>Blessed are ye when Men shall revile you</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And let us go on in the Way of our Duty in full Assurance of Faith, having our Hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience, and our Bodies washed with pure Water, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 10.22.) And while a Spirit of Giddiness possesseth the Minds of some, so that they are tossed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine by the Slight of Men, and cunning Craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive, (<HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 14.) Let us be stedfast unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord, for as much as we know that our Labour is not in vain in the Lord, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 55.) And holding fast the Profession of our Faith, without wavering, let us consider one another, to provoke unto Love and good Works, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 23, 24.) And then Religion may flou∣rish and prosper in our Churches.</P>
<P>III. Let me address the Reverend and Learned Pre∣sident of our College, and Professor of Divinity, and the worthy Tutors, who are assisting in the Government and Instruction of the Students there.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="32" REF="005173_0035_1016CF89907AD770"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Learned Gentlemen!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The College, we trust, is a Nursery of Religion and Piety, as well as of good humane Literature; and to you is committed the Care of our Sons, not only for their Instruction in the liberal Arts and Sciences, but also in the Principles of the true Christian Religion; and it is expected that while they are under your Care and Instruction, there be a good Foundation laid, by building upon which they may be useful Instruments in their Generation of promoting and preserving the Life of our holy Religion: And by doing what you can for this End, you may be greatly profitable to the Religion of Christ.</P>
<P>Our College hath been very much the Glory of <HI>New-England</HI> for more than a Century of Years, and is so at this Day; many eminent and excellent Men for Learn∣ing, Wisdom, Piety and Prudence, have sprang from thence; Men that have been of great Use and Service both in the Church and State; several of our excellent <HI>Governours,</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Particularly, <HI>Stoughton, Dudley,</HI> and <HI>Belcher,</HI> in this Pro∣vince; <HI>Saltonstall</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> in <HI>Connecticut;</HI> and <HI>Went∣worth</HI> in <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI></NOTE> have been educated there; and many of our Magistrates and Ministers; who in their Day and Generation were happy Instruments in the Hand of God of promoting the Religion of Christ in these Chur∣ches, and among this People: And blessed be God, our Eyes behold many such at this Day.</P>
<P>The Lord grant that the College may never become a Seminary for degenerate Plants, who will with their foolish Hands pull down those Houses which their pious Fathers have been building for the Name of the Lord in this Wilderness; as the Reverend and Learned Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI> (who for many Years presided there to the great Comfort and Satisfaction of many under his Care) feared in his Day.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>Ichabod.</HI> p. 75.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="005173_0036_1016CF8C2ED234C0"/>
The Welfare and Prosperity of these Churches, under God, doth very much depend upon the good Govern∣ment &amp; Education of our Sons at the College: if they come forth well instructed, and established in the true Christian Religion, they may be happy Instruments of promoting it in their Day and Generation; but if they come forth poisoned with corrupt Principles, they'l be likely to poison and ruin these Churches.</P>
<P>I shall now pass to the last Address which I have to offer on the Behalf of our holy Religion.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>IV. Let me address all Gentlemen, and Persons in a private Capacity; and particularly Heads of Families who make a Profession of the true Christian Religion, to do what they can to promote and preserve the Life of it.</P>
<P><HI>Men and Brethren,</HI> You may do much for Religion in the Places God hath set you in: And indeed, all that <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> can do, will not avail much, unless you put to your helping Hand.</P>
<P>Religion will most certainly die from among us, un∣less Heads of Families keep it alive in their Houses: <HI>Well then,</HI> stir up your selves, you who are Heads of Families to this your Duty and Interest. And to this End:</P>
<P>Set up and keep up the Worship of God in your Families; and make your Houses, Houses of Prayer, and resolve with <HI>Joshua,</HI> that as for you and your Houses you will serve the Lord, <HI>Josh.</HI> 24. 15. When Heads of Families cast off Fear, and restrain Prayer before God, and have no Hearts to bless their Houses in the Name of the Lord, they are no true Friends to Religi∣on; and tho' they may not be open and professed Enemies to it, yet by bringing up Children and Ser∣vants in the Neglect of this Duty, they are bringing up a Generation that will, unless sovereign Grace prevent, bid Defiance to Religion. Again,</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="005173_0037_1016CF8E87C136D8"/>
Instruct your Children and Servants in the Principles and Duties of Religion; teach them the good Know∣ledge of God, and of Jesus Christ, and charge them to keep the Way of the Lord; thus did <HI>Abraham, (Gen.</HI> 18. ver. 19.) and <HI>David,</HI> (1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 9.) and so should you. <HI>Deut.</HI> 6. 6, 7. <HI>Prov.</HI> 27. 6. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 4. and 9. Again,</P>
<P>Set good Examples before your Children and Ser∣vants, Examples of Sobriety, Temperance, Meekness, Patience, Humility, Justice, Righteousness, Charity, Faith, and Purity of Life; that you may be able to say to them, with a good Conscience, as <HI>Gideon</HI> said to his Soldiers, <HI>Look on me and do likewise,</HI> Judg. 7. 17.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>Have a watchful Eye over them, and labour to re∣strain and keep them back from bad Company and Courses, as much as you can. <HI>Eli</HI>'s Neglect to restrain his Sons from their wicked Practices, was a great Hurt to Religion, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 17. and at length prov'd the Ruin of his House. See 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3. 13, 14.</P>
<P>These Things Heads of Families should do to pre∣serve and promote the Life of our holy Religion.</P>
<P>And we should all, as we have Opportunity and Ability, freely, cheerfully, and abundantly contribute of our Substance for the promoting and preserving the Religion of Christ, not only in the Places where we live, but also in other Places, where we know our Help is wanted.</P>
<P>It was the Custom and Practice of the primitive Christians to do what they could to promote the true Christian Religion in one Place and another by their publick Contributions; the Churches of <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Achaia</HI> contributed freely and abundantly for that End. <HI>Rom.</HI> 15. 26. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 1, 2, 3, 4.</P>
<P>And we have some modern Examples of this Nature; many of our Christian Brethren and Friends in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> have contributed abundantly for the Propaga∣tion of our holy Religion in remote Places, where the
<PB N="35" REF="005173_0038_1016CF916E6C1438"/>
People have been either not able, or not willing to promote it, among themselves:—And there are many in this Country and Province that have fared the better for their Christian Liberality. And their Zeal should provoke us to the like Works of Piety towards God, and Charity towards the Souls of Men. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 2.</P>
<P>And who indeed that hath experienced the Power and Efficacy of God's Word upon his own Heart for his Illumination, Conviction, Conversion and Comfort, will not endeavour, this Way, when 'tis in the Power of his Hand, that others may experience the same?</P>
<P>I should think it a sad Epitaph should this be wrote upon my Grave, said a certain Person. <Q>Here lies a Man that would not serve his Generation by propa∣gating as much Acquaintance with Religion to Pos∣terity as he could. <HI>Or,</HI> Here lies a Man that had a Life of many Years in the World, but he went thrô it, and yet no Man knew God the better for him, and no one got more Acquaintance with God thrô his Means.</Q></P>
<P>We are not made for our selves alone, but we are made to help in making the World better; and if the Age we live in is not the better for us, it will be the worse.</P>
<P>Our Estates, if justly gotten, come of God, he is the Owner of them, more so than we are, and when we bestow any Thing for the Propagation of Religion, we may say as King <HI>David</HI> did, when <HI>he,</HI> and his <HI>Princes,</HI> and <HI>People</HI> offered willingly and abundantly for the Service of the House of God; <HI>All Things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee,</HI> 1 Chron. 29. 14. And when we thus give to the Lord we honour him with our Substance, and take the most proper Way to increase what we have. See <HI>Prov.</HI> 3. 9. 10. and Chap. 11. 25.</P>
<P>Thus I have with great Plainess appeared as an Ad∣vocate for that Religion which is our Life.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="005173_0039_1016CF94D71685C0"/>
And now I shall conclude with three Arguments to excite us all to do what we can in the Places &amp; Stations God hath set us in, to preserve and promote the Life of our holy Religion. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Con.</HI> That the only true Religion hath been lost from many Places and People that once enjoy'd it, thrô their Neglect of it.</P>
<P>God hath always preserved the true Religion in the World, and he will not suffer the Gates of Hell, so to prevail against it, as to destroy it out of the World so long as Time shall endure, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16. 18. But yet it hath not been always preserved in one Place, &amp; among one People, but it hath been moving from Place to Place; and from one Family, Nation, and Kingdom, to another.</P>
<P>God first gave Life to the true Religion in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Family; then in <HI>Noah</HI>'s; then in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s; and then in <HI>Isaac</HI>'s; then in <HI>Jacob</HI>'s; and then in the Nation of the Jews; and then among the Gentiles.</P>
<P>No People have had it among them from the begin∣ning of the World to this Day; but it hath been mov∣ing, and lost from many Places and People, as is evi∣dent from History both sacred and profane.</P>
<P><HI>It hath been lost from the Nation of the Jews for many hundred Years past.</HI> If we look into the holy Scriptures of the old and new Testament, we may there find that the Jews had once the only true Religion in the World; but now it is lost from them. Our Lord Jesus Christ threatned them with the Loss of it, when he said as in Mat. 21. 43. <HI>The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the Fruits thereof.</HI> And as he threatned so it came to pass, and they have now no true Religion among them: Thrô Unbelief they were broken off from God's Covenant, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 20. and being broken off God hath said to them, <HI>Loammi,</HI> i. e. <HI>Ye are not my People, and I will not be your God;</HI> as in <HI>Hos.</HI> 1. 9. Again,</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="005173_0040_1016CF98A3C02D08"/>
<HI>It hath been lost from many Places of the Gentiles.</HI> When the Jews were broken off from God's Covenant, then the believing Gentiles were graffed in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 11. and the true Religion was with them; and hath been preserved among them unto this Day; but it hath not continued in any one Place from that Time to this; <HI>no;</HI> but it hath been moving from Place to Place.</P>
<P>Those Places in which it flourished in the Days of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, are now destitute of it: The seven Churches which were in the most famous Cities of <HI>Asia,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thiatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, &amp; Laodicea,</HI> of which we read, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1. 11. in which our Lord Jesus Christ walked, are all now ex∣tinct; and the People that dwell there walk in Darkness; in the Darkness of Ignorance, Superstition, &amp; Heresy; and in some Places they have quite lost the Christian Name.</P>
<P>And as the true Christian Religion hath long since been lost from <HI>Asia,</HI> so it hath also from <HI>Affrica,</HI> where there were once some Thousands of Christian Churches, and many famous Ministers; as <HI>Tertullian, Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Austin;</HI> whose Writings are still in Use in the Christian Church.</P>
<P>And as the true Christian Religion hath been lost out of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Affrica,</HI> so it is in a great Measure lost out of <HI>Europe.</HI> In <HI>Bavaria,</HI> in <HI>Austria,</HI> in <HI>Moravia,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Transilvania,</HI> there have been famous Christian Churches, but now they are corrupted with Popery, and Socinianism. As the learned and excellent Dr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> observes.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>Ichabod.</HI> p. 61, 62.</NOTE></P>
<P>There was once in <HI>Rome</HI> the true Christian Religion; a holy Church, a People beloved of God, called to be Saints, whose Faith was spoken of throughout the whole World, as we read, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 7. But what is the true Christian Religion reduced to in that great City? And what is that Church come to? May she not be called the <HI>Mother of Harlots,</HI> and <HI>Abominations of the Earth,</HI> Rev. 17. 5.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="38" REF="005173_0041_1016CF9A692AC5C8"/>
2. <HI>Con.</HI> That the true Christian Religion may be lost from the People of God in this Land, and will be so, if there be no Care taken to preserve it.</P>
<P>It is now something more than six Score Years since the true Christian Religion was brought into this Land, (which was then a Wilderness) by our pious Ancestors; and through the wonderful Patience and Goodness of God it is now handed down to the third and fourth Ge∣neration; but we don't know that it shall be continued for Generations to come; <HI>Gray Hairs are here and there upon it;</HI> many Symptoms of its languishing and dying State and Condition may be seen by every one that hath any Skill in Religion.</P>
<P>Are not the Divisions and groundless Seperations which are in many of our Churches in this Land, evi∣dent Tokens of the sickly State of Religion?</P>
<P>And doth not the springing up, and prevailing of Doctrines contrary to the true Christian Religion in one Place and another, threaten the Death of our holy Religion, particularly <HI>Deism, Arianism, Arminianism</HI> and <HI>Antinomianism?</HI> Thô the three former do not appear so bare-faced among us as the latter, yet they have too many Vouchers in some Places where the true Religion is professed. As for the Antinomian Heresies, they seem to be spreading apace, and it is high Time to guard against them, lest these Churches should be infested and sorely distressed with their Errors, as they were in their early Days. A short Account of which the Reverend and Learned Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> hath given us in his <HI>Magnalia,</HI> which is worthy of our Observation at this Day.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Book 7th. p. 14, 15, 16. The Church of God had not long been in this <HI>Wilderness</HI> before the <HI>Dragon</HI> cast forth several <HI>Floods</HI> to devour it; but not the least of those <HI>Floods</HI> was one of <HI>Antinomian</HI> and <HI>Familistical</HI> Heresies, with which the Country began betimes to be infested.—And the Stir which they made about those <HI>Opinions,</HI> grew so general that they quickly affected all the publick Affairs of the Country.—</P>
<P>There did then arise in the Land a Distinction between such as were under a <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> and such as were under a <HI>Covenant of Grace;</HI> wherein the bigger Part of the Country in the Management of that Inquiry; <HI>By what Evidence must a Man proceed in taking to himself the Comforts of his Justification?</HI> laid upon our <HI>Sanctification</HI> the first and main Stress of our comfortable <HI>Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Opinionists</HI> were for another Sort of <HI>Evidence</HI> as their chief; namely, <HI>The Spirit of God by a powerful Application of a Promise,</HI> begetting in us and revealing to us a powerful <HI>Assurance</HI> of our being justified.</P>
<P>Now the Truth might easily have united both of the Perswasions, yet they that were of the <HI>latter Way</HI> carried the Matter on to a very <HI>perilous Door,</HI> open'd not only for new <HI>enthusiastical Revelations,</HI> but also for a Neglect of such <HI>Qualifications</HI> in all <HI>Godliness</HI> and <HI>Honesty,</HI> as must be found in all that would be <HI>prospered,</HI> and not <HI>rejected</HI> in their Confidences. Yea, they employed their Distincti∣ons about a <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> and a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> at so extravagant a Rate as threatned a Subversion of all the peaceable Order in the Colonies.</P>
<P>They drove at this; That the most virtuous Man upon Earth might not be admitted into the <HI>Churches</HI> without professing, that renouncing of <HI>Sanctification,</HI> as an Evi∣dence of his good State, he waited for <HI>immediate Revela∣tions</HI> to assure him of it. And such as were already in <HI>Church Communion,</HI> unless they became fond of the <HI>New-Lights,</HI> in this Thing pretended unto, were presently branded as favouring a Covenant of Works.</P>
<P>The Contention spread it self into <HI>Families,</HI> and all private and smaller Societies, who were to be accounted under a <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> and so Enemies unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and who were not? which was determined among the busy <HI>Sectaries</HI> by a Person's accommodating himself unto their <HI>fine-spun</HI> Speculations. <HI>Illic ipsum esse fuit promereri.</HI></P>
<P>The Disturbance proceeded from thence into all the general Affairs of the Publick: The Expedition against the <HI>Pequot Indians</HI> was most shamefully discouraged be∣cause the Army was too much under a <HI>Covenant of Works;</HI> and the <HI>Magistrates</HI> began to be contemned as being of <HI>a legal Spirit,</HI> and having therewithal a Tang of <HI>Anti-Christ</HI> in them; nor could the ordering of Town Lots, or Town Rates, or any Meeting whatsoever escape the Confusions of this Controversy.</P>
<P>'Tis incredible what Alienations of Mind, and what a very <HI>Calenture</HI> the Devil raised in the Country upon this <HI>odd Occasion.</HI></P>
<P>But it may not be amiss to describe a little more parti∣cularly the <HI>Methods</HI> whereof the <HI>Devil</HI> therein served his In∣terests. The <HI>Sectaries</HI> acquainted themselves with as many as possibly they could, and carried on their Acquain∣tance with all the <HI>Courtesies</HI> and <HI>Kindnesses</HI> that they could contrive to ingratiate themselves in the Hearts of others, especially of <HI>New-Comers</HI> into the Place; they herewithal appear'd wondrous <HI>holy, humble,</HI> self-denying and spiritual, and full of the most charming Expressions imaginable. <HI>Free Grace, Gospel Truths, Glorious Light, and holding forth of Christ,</HI> was all their Tone: And meeting with Christians that had any Doubts in their Minds about their own future Happiness, they would insinuato into them that they had never taken <HI>a right Course for Comfort,</HI> by going to <HI>evidence</HI> their good Estate by their <HI>Sanctification;</HI> but that there was a more evangelical Way to Peace, by which they themselves were got above all their Fears for ever.</P>
<P>They began usually to seduce <HI>Women</HI> into their Notions, and by those <HI>Women,</HI> like their first Mother, they soon hook'd in the Husband also. Having wrought themselves any where into a good Esteem, they s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t themselves with a manifold Subtilty to undermine the Esteem of the <HI>Mi∣nisters,</HI> and intimate that their <HI>Teachers</HI> themselves, never having been <HI>taught of God,</HI> had mis-taught, and misled the People.—Whence it came to pass that some who had followed those Ministers three thousand Miles thrô ten thousand Deaths, yet now took up such Prejudices, not only against their <HI>Doctrines,</HI> but against their <HI>Persons</HI> also, that they did never care to hear them, or see them any more.</P>
<P>They administred their <HI>Poisons</HI> in smaller <HI>Doses</HI> and not without <HI>Preparations,</HI> wherein if any made any Boggle, they would presently retreat, and say, <HI>Nay, don't mistake me, for I mean the same that you do, we differ only in Words.</HI> And they would besure still father their Whimsies upon such Persons as were held in most <HI>Veneration</HI> throughout the Country; but if they were brought Face to Face, they would still wind out with some cunning Evasions. Thus they went on 'till they had got some noted <HI>Persons</HI> in all <HI>Order</HI> to patronise them.</P>
<P>And then it is impossible to describe the Censures, the Contempts, the Affronts cast upon the best Men in the Land, as Men <HI>ignorant of Christ;</HI> and the terrible Disor∣der and Contention that ensued in all Societies.</P>
<P>The Ministry of the Country, awakned by these <HI>Noises</HI> about the Temple, had several Meetings, that they might set Matters to Rights, all which were ineffectual, until the <HI>General Court</HI> called a <HI>Synod</HI> of all the Churches in the Country to meet at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in the Year 1637.</P>
<P>The Synod being assembled, with the Rev. <HI>Thomas Hooker</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peter Buckley,</HI> chosen its Moderators at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> (then called by the Name of <HI>New-Town</HI>) on <HI>August</HI> 30th. 1637. there were produced about eighty-two erroneous Opinions and Expressions which had been ut∣tered in the Country by several Men, at several Times.</P>
<P>The Authors of these Errors were neither mentioned nor inquired; but the <HI>Errors</HI> themselves were considered, confuted, and condemned from the plain <HI>Word of God.</HI> For indeed the Design of the <HI>Synod,</HI> was not <HI>Jus Dare,</HI> but only <HI>Jus Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re,</HI> and to exercise only a Power <HI>dicisive</HI> of <HI>Doctrines,</HI> not <HI>judicial</HI> on <HI>Persons,</HI> leaving it unto <HI>par∣ticular Churches</HI> to pass their Censures on the <HI>Persons</HI> who should hold the <HI>Doctrines</HI> by the Determination of the Synod found subversive to the <HI>Fundamentals of Religion.</HI> And soon followed an happy Conclusion of the whole Matter.</P></Q></NOTE></P>

Again, what doth Mens flying from Ministers and Ordinances discover? Doth not this shew want of Love to Christ and his Ordinances? If Ministers shew themselves to be unconverted, (as some say they are) let them be convicted; and if they are obstinate, let them be deposed; and let not Churches break into Pieces, because some fondly think, and boldly say, their Mini∣sters are not good Men.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="005173_0043_1016B8442327BD98"/>
Again, Doth not the censorious and uncharitable Spirit which so much prevails in many who make high Pretences to Religion, evidently shew that they are void and destitute of that true Christian Charity, which if a Man hath not he is nothing? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.2.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="005173_0044_1016CFA1587BAB70"/>
<HI>Again,</HI> Doth not an hankering Mind after Visions, and Revelations, and unlearned Teachers, shew a sickly and distemper'd State of Soul?</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="005173_0045_1016CFA33826F448"/>
And doth not the abounding of Mockers and Scoffers at the true Religion, and those that appear zealous for the promoting it; and that secure, careless, and uncon∣cerned Frame of Spirit which appears in many living under the Ministry of God's Word, plainly shew that our holy Religion is dying from among us?</P>
<P>I can't but look on these Things as sad Symptoms, and if they prevail, the true Christian Religion will lan∣guish and die from among us; and we shall be a dead People; spiritually dead, as the Church of <HI>Sardis</HI> was, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Con.</HI> That if the true Christian Religion should be lost from among us, a Flood of Calamities will break in upon us, and we shall be a miserable People.</P>
<P>Our holy Religion is our Beauty, Glory, Strength and Safety; and when this is lost from among us, our Beauty and Glory, Strength and Safety will be lost with it. While we preserve and promote our holy Religion, God will be with us, to protect and preserve us; but if we loose this, then God will be gone, as to his gra∣cious Presence with us, and Woe will be to us, for his Judgments will pursue and overtake us. Hos.9.12. <HI>Wo to them when I depart from them.</HI></P>
<P>Look into those Places from whence the true Christian Religion hath been lost, and see how it is with the Peo∣ple there; and as you find it in those Places, so you may expect it will be in this Land when the Religion of Christ shall be lost from us.</P>
<P>True and credible History gives us a sad and melan∣cholly Account of the Circumstances of many Places from whence the true Religion hath been lost.</P>
<P>As for the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which was once the Glory of all Lands, it hath now lost its Glory, and is
<PB N="43" REF="005173_0046_1016CFA80E6B77A0"/>
become a barren Soil, inhabited by Turks &amp; Heathen, a People whose Religion is empty and vain.</P>
<P>And as for <HI>Jerusalem</HI> which was called the holy City, when the true Religion flourished in it; it is now a miserable Town, in which are no Inhabitants beside Infidels and Idolaters; and on Mount Zion, in that very Place where <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple stood, there is now a <HI>Mosque,</HI> or Turkish Church for Mahomitan Worship.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI>'s Ichabod. p. 57.</NOTE></P>
<P>And what a miserable Place is the lesser <HI>Asia,</HI> where were seven famous Churches, beside many of less Note. In the sixty-sixth Year after Christ, <HI>Laodicea</HI> was destroyed by an Earthquake; and about the Year one Hundred eighty two, the City of <HI>Smyrna</HI> came to Ruin by an Earthquake.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clark</HI>'s Mirrour, p. 488.</NOTE></P>
<P>And as for <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and the other Cities that remain, they are given over to strong Delusions, and to the Be∣lief of doctrinal Lies.</P>
<P>And as it is with those Places from whence the true Religion hath been lost, so it may be with <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> when our holy Religion shall die from among us.</P>
<P>Therefore let us all stir up our selves in the Places and Stations God hath set us in, to do what we can to pre∣serve and promote the Life of our holy Religion, which is indeed our Life.</P>
<P>And to this End let us consider, how we have left our first Love; remember from whence we are fallen, and repent, and do our first Works; for if this be not done, Christ will come unto us quickly, and will re∣move our Candlestick out of his Place; and then we shall be a miserable People. But if this be done by us, he will walk in the midst of these golden Candlesticks, and they shall not be moved: He will help us, and that right early.</P>
