<Q><HI>Offer unto GOD Thanksgiving, and pay thy Vows unto the Most High. And call upon me in the Day of Trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL Nature is full of GOD: He not only inhabits Eternity, but he fills Immensity: He is intimately present with all the Works of his Hands; upholding, superintending, ordering and directing all Things, through the immense Universe: His all-ruling Providence extends to the vegetable and animal, as well as to the rational Creation; and so it does to all the dead Parts of Matter, thro' the whole created System; insomuch that there is not a Motion in the natural, nor a Thought in the intellectual World, but what is subject to his Controul.</P>
<P>As 'tis a Matter of great Importance, that a deep Sense of this should be fixed upon our Minds; the Holy Writings are admirably suited and adapted to this Purpose: There is a remarkable Difference in this Respect, between the holy Scriptures, and human Compositions; the latter are wont to relate Facts and Events as they are; pointing us to the immediate Causes or Occasions of them; whereas the holy Scriptures are perpetually introducing
<PB N="6" REF="009417_0004_0F743B19DABE5BF8"/>
GOD in all the Scenes of Nature, and the Affairs and Transactions of Men; and representing Him, as the supreme Cause and Agent, "Who worketh all things according to the Counsel of his own Will; without whom, not a Sparrow falls to the Ground; and by whom the Hairs of our Heads are all numbered." At the powerful Call of his Voice, the whole Universe of Things sprang into Being, into Regularity, Order and Harmony; and his own al∣mighty Arm perpetually sustains the universal Frame. The Laws of Nature as they are called, are no other, than certain Methods or Rules fix'd by Himself; agreeably to which He governs the natural World. If it rains, 'tis "God that sendeth Rain on the Just and on the Unjust." If the stor∣my Winds arise, in the Language of Inspiration, "The Lord hath his Way in the Whirlwind and in the Storms and the Clouds are the Dust of his Feet." Nahum 1. 3. If it thunders, "The GOD of Glory thundereth, He thundereth marvelously with the Voice of his Excellency." Psalm xxix. 3. Job xxxvii. 4, 5. If there is an Earthquake, "GOD shaketh the Earth out of her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble." Job ix. 6. And if we go on to consider the Affairs of Men and Nations; the same Remark holds good. Does a Nation or Kingdom rise, prosper and flourish; or, is it brought down to Ruin and Desolation; still the Hand of the supreme Ruler is to be acknowledged and adored. Is a Nation unsuccessful in War; "It is GOD that poureth Contempt upon Princes, and weak∣neth the Strength of the Mighty." Or, does a Na∣tion prevail in Battle, and carry on a War to a
<PB N="7" REF="009417_0004_0F743B19DABE5BF8"/>
successful Issue, a desireable and happy Peace; "It is GOD that fighteth for his People; through him, they do valiantly; and he it is that treadeth down their Foes." Of every Deliverance and Sal∣vation we receive; particular public and national Salvations; we are still reminded to acknowledge and adore GOD, as the Author; and to render the Praise and Glory to Him. These Sentiments of Piety and Religion the holy Writings unitedly tend to inspire; particularly that Portion of them, I have now read to you; "Offer unto GOD Thanks∣giving, &amp;c.—" A careful Attention to the Works of Providence, and the Operations of GOD's Hand, is e∣ver our Wisdom and our Duty: And as we now have a particular Call to it; it is to be hoped, our Atten∣tion will be particularly careful, serious and devout.</P>
<P>The Words may be accomodated to the particu∣lar Occasion, of the present Solemnity; and be thus treated and illustrated.</P>

<P>I. <HI>We have been in Trouble;</HI> and who among Mankind have not? Into this apostate sinful World, Men are born to Trouble and Sorrow as the Sparks fly upwards: All the Individuals of the human Race, more or less drink of this bitter Cup. Aches
<PB N="8" REF="009417_0005_0F743B1A393F9BF0"/>
and Pains and Maladies without Number, Crosses and Disappointments, and heart-felt Bereavements, are but some of the Sorrows and Troubles Man∣kind are Subject to, in this Valley of Tears: And well would it be, very well, if these Sorrows were met and endur'd <HI>as</HI> from the Hand of GOD, the wise and good Governor of the World; with a calm and quiet Resignation to his Pleasure; and a firm and steady Reliance on his Providence and Grace.</P>
<P>And as for Ourselves, <HI>us</HI> in this Colony, and in this Land, including our Mother Kingdom; 'tis certain we have been in Trouble, great Trouble!—have been involv'd, for a long Time, in a bloody War with <HI>France</HI> and with the <HI>Savages</HI> of the Wil∣derness; and for some Time, with <HI>Spain.</HI> War considered in itself, is a sore and dismal Calamity; and not to be entred upon, but with good Advice, and with a View to Peace: Nor does GOD wil∣lingly afflict his People, with so terrible a Scourge, but their Iniquities seperate between GOD and them, and draw down his Judgments upon them. Sin is the Cause, the hated Cause and Origin of all the Miseries and Calamities that overspread the Earth. 'Tis Sin that contracts the Brow of Heaven into Frowns; and stirs up the Indignation of an holy GOD. We are a sinful, guilty and degenerate Peo∣ple; and the GOD of our Fathers has been angry with us, and has called for the Sword of our popish and pagan Adversaries, to avange the Quarrel of his broken Covenant and violated Law; and to chastise and punish us, for our many Land-defiling Sins and Abominations.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009417_0005_0F743B1A393F9BF0"/>
If we look back to the Commencement of the late War, how illy were we prepared for it? How low was the Nation sunk into Indolence and Le∣thargy? How little of a martial Spirit, and the old <HI>British</HI> Bravery was to be found among them? How sadly did this bode, and how discouraging and gloomy were our Prospects? Accordingly, some of the Events of the first Year of the War were very calamitous and disgraceful; such as will stain the <HI>British</HI> Annals, and must be resented with Shame and Grief by every sensible <HI>Englishman.</HI></P>
<P>The War opened in the Year seventeen hundred and fifty five, with the ill-conducted and unsuc∣cessful March of General <HI>Braddock,</HI> against Fort <HI>Du Quesne;</HI> a Fort erected by the <HI>French,</HI> on the Territory of his <HI>Britannic</HI> Majesty: This Disgrace and Overthrow was some what qualified by the Re∣duction of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> by Colonel <HI>Monckton;</HI> and Sir <HI>William Johnson'</HI>s Victory over a <HI>French</HI> Army, near Lake <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>The Year fifty-six will not be thought honora∣ble to the <HI>British</HI> Name or History: The scandalous Behaviour of Admiral <HI>Byng</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> and in Consequence of that, the Loss of the Island of <HI>Minorca,</HI> cannot be recollected but with Shame and Regret. And not long after this, (for I mean not minutely to trace the several Steps of the War) what a melancholly and gloomy Period followed, to <HI>Great Britain</HI> and her Provinces. At Home, what Uncertainty, Darkness and Confusion attended the public Counsels? And how were they embroil'd by Divisions and Distractions? Whilst Defeat, Frus∣tration
<PB N="10" REF="009417_0006_0F743B1AF4D285A0"/>
and Shame attended the <HI>British</HI> Arms, in the several Quarters of the World.</P>
<P>Let us fix our Attention for a Moment or two on <HI>America,</HI> the original Object of the Contest, in which we are most intimately concern'd, and to which therefore, I intend principally to confine these Remarks. How were our Fortresses and strong Holds demolished or burnt to Ashes? Our Coun∣trymen and Friends captivated and butchered? Our Troops repulsed and turned back with Frustration and Shame? At that gloomy Period, what Trem∣bling took hold on us, and Confusion covered us? How did every Countenance gather Paleness, and the Panic spread through whole Provinces?</P>
<P>Did not the People of this Land tremble for the Ark of GOD, and all our dear Privileges? Appre∣hensive, fearful, whether GOD would not permit an exasperated Foe, elated with Success and Victory, to carry the devouring Sword through the Land, at∣tended with Desolation and wide-spreading Ruin. This was a dark Day to the <HI>British American</HI> Provin∣ces; a Day of Sorrow and Trouble; a Day, on which, we were loudly call'd upon, to look above an Arm of Flesh—to look to the GOD of Armies, the Supreme Ruler of the World, and our Cove∣nant God, for Protection, Deliverance and Salva∣tion. And did we not take that Course? Which leads me to say,</P>
<P>II. <HI>We have call'd upon God in a Day of Trouble.</HI> "Call upon me in the Day of Trouble." In the Season of our Darkness and Distress, we poured out our Supplications before the Most High. Pray∣er, daily Prayer to GOD, is a Duty incumbent on
<PB N="11" REF="009417_0006_0F743B1AF4D285A0"/>
every human Being, that understands what Prayer is: And for a Christian, for one who names the Name of CHRIST to neglect Prayer, daily Prayer, is quite inexcusable. In all our Ways we are to acknowledge GOD, and maintain an humble, holy Intercourse with Him, through all the Transacti∣ons and Affairs of our Lives. The Sense and Act∣ings of our Hearts towards GOD, at all Times, should agree &amp; harmonize with the various Dispen∣sations and Aspects of his Providence towards us: This is to maintain and enjoy Communion with GOD, in the Despensations of his Providence. E∣very Kindness and Smile of his Providence should be met with correspondent Gratitude, Thanksgi∣ving and Praise: So, for every Thing we stand in Need of for Time or Eternity, we are humbly to call upon God. In all the Sorrows and Troubles, Dangers and Distresses we are incident to, in this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Sin and Changes, we are still to make GOD our Refuge and Dependence; deeply sensible, that without GOD in vain is the Help of Man; that GOD is the exhaustless Fountain of all Good, of all Help—the Father of Mercy and of Lights, from whom cometh down every good and perfect Gift: And in our Seasons of special and imminent Distress and Danger, we have a particular Call, to be very fervent and importunate in our Addresses to GOD: And this, I hope, was, in some Measure, the Case during the Course of the late War; and particular∣ly at that gloomy Period above-mentioned. Did not the Churches and Congregations of GOD's Peo∣ple in <HI>New England</HI>—did not we in this Colony and in this Town, frequently and cheerfully meet
<PB N="12" REF="009417_0007_0F743B1BBA64D658"/>
in the House of GOD, to offer up our Supplications, and pour out our Prayers before the Mercy-Seat, for Protection and Safety, for Deliverance and Salvation? How did you then seem to be struck with a Convicti∣on and Sense, that if GOD did not appear for us, and his own Arm did not bring us Salvation, we were a ruin'd and undone People? How forward did you then seem to be to look above all created Help, to Him that governs the whole World and orders all the Affairs of it as he pleases, and to seek and cry to him for Deliverance? With what Freedom and Earnest∣ness did you croud the Sanctuary of GOD, eager to unite in pouring out your Supplications before his Throne, and to hear Instructions from his Word? You cannot have forgotten, how cheerfully you uni∣ted in setting apart Days for Fasting and Prayer; and Weekly Seasons, for special and solemn Prayer, that GOD would mercifully appear for us and deliver us. And I hope a Conviction is left upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hearts, that He is a Prayer-Hearing GOD, and that it is not a vain Thing to seek and pray to Him.</P>
<P>And tho' we have Reason to suppose, that many Persons did not pray, with such a Sense of their own Unworthiness and evil Deserts, and the Power and Wisdom, Grace and Mercy and All-sufficien∣cy of GOD, and such a Dependence on his Power and Grace through CHRIST, as they ought; yet, no Doubt, many Others were graciously sincere and cordial in their Addresses to GOD. And I have thought and still think, that a Spirit of Prayer and Supplication, in some thing of an uncommon De∣gree, was poured out on GOD's People in the Land: And when GOD gives an Heart to pray, He is
<PB N="13" REF="009417_0007_0F743B1BBA64D658"/>
wont to find an Ear to hear. And did he not hear? Did he not hearken to the Voice of our Supplications, and send us an Answer of Peace? Did he not hearken to the Voice of Men, sinful, guilty Men? And in Answer to the Supplications of his People, did he not make bare his own Arm, and work Deliverance and Salvation for us? Yes, He is a Prayer-hearing GOD, and has never said to the Seed of <HI>Jacob,</HI> seek ye my Face in vain. And so I am led to say,</P>
<P>III. <HI>God has delivered us.</HI> "Call upon me, in the Day of Trouble; I will deliver thee." Yes, GOD has delivered us, with a Salvation never to be forgotten.</P>
<P>GOD might justly, provoked by our Sins, have given us up a Prey, into the Hands of those that hated us; and doom'd us to a State of dismal Sla∣very, under <HI>Gallic</HI> Chains and <HI>Popish</HI> Superstition and Tyranny: But of his rich and abundant Grace he has delivered us. After a Period of Darkness and Perplexity; the Darkness vanished, the Clouds scattered, and the Day dawn'd. "GOD'S right Hand, and his holy Arm, and the Light of his Countenance, have brought us Salvation, because he had a Favour for us." Suddenly the Scene changed, and our Covenant GOD, who seemed in a Manner to have cast us off, appeared for us, in our Distress.</P>
<P>He was pleased to raise up those, whom he de∣lighted to honor, as the chosen Instruments of our Deliverance. In this Connection, the <HI>Patriot Pitt</HI> will not be forgotten. Unity and Harmony were restored to our public Counsels. The British Lion
<PB N="14" REF="009417_0008_0F743B1C817A5B60"/>
aroused as from a Sleep. A martial Spirit and Fire was diffused and spread into our Fleets and Armies. Expeditions were form'd and plan'd with Wisdom and Consistency; and carried into Execution with Firmness and Steadiness; and a Spirit and Resolu∣tion that Nothing could daunt or resist. The guilty, ambitious Schemes of <HI>France</HI> vanished like a Dream of the Night: Our Enemies fled before us in every Climate: Our Fleets and Armies went on from conquering to conquer. The <HI>British</HI> Troops triumphed in every Quarter of the World: <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> beheld with Wonder our Success and Victories.</P>
<P>It would be beside my present Purpose, to enu∣merate the great Things GOD has done in <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> Let me briefly men∣tion a few Instances nearer Home. <HI>Cape-Breton, Crown-Point, Quebec, Montreal,</HI> yea, the whole <HI>French</HI> Territory, almost, in <HI>North-America,</HI> wrested from them, was given into our Hands: Besides <HI>Guadaloupe, Martinic<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> &amp;c. in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> and the <HI>Havana</HI> from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards!</HI> what a wretched, despicable Figure will they make, in the future History of these Times! And what crowns all, the War is at Length terminated in a desirable and happy Peace. The dismal Calamities of War, which had overspread the several Quarters of the Earth, are at an End. The Supreme Ru∣ler, who says to the proud Waves of the Sea, "
"Hi∣therto shall ye go and no further," and who over∣rules the Hearts of Men, has diffused a Spirit of Union and Harmony among the several contending Powers, and mercifully brought on a general Paci∣fication
<PB N="15" REF="009417_0008_0F743B1C817A5B60"/>
—a Peace, by which we have acquired a mighty Enlargement of Dominion and Territory, and many Advantages—a Peace peculiarly favour∣able and advantageous to us, in <HI>America;</HI> even beyond our most sanguine Expectations, when the War first opened. These are the LORD'S Doings, and justly marvellous in our Eyes. Many and strik∣ing are the Demonstrations of a divine Interposition, and of the Goodness and Power of GOD exerted in our Behalf.</P>
<P>Who commanded the Winds and the Seas, and ordered the Seasons, from Time to Time so mer∣cifully? Who commanded the Earth to yield her Increase, and furnished Resources sufficient to car∣ry on so many Expeditions, in so many different Parts of the World, at the same Time? Who spi∣rited the Soldiery to offer themselves, and armed them with Patience, Resolution and Courage? Who inspired our worthy Commanders, by Sea and Land, with Wisdom, Prudence and Magnanimity, so proportioned to their elevated and important Stations? Permit me to say, on this Occasion; Who raised up the late intrepid, heroic Leader, the gal∣lant <HI>Wolf;</HI> and furnished him with Talents, to so uncommon a Degree, for the important Province he was called to? Who gave him an Head to Plan, and an Arm to execute the mighty Design, his Heart was so much set upon? To execute it in a Manner, that extorted the Admiration and Aston∣ishment of his very Enemies? Who animated the Nation and it's public Councils with such a Spirit of Union and Harmony, to prosecute the War with Vigor, according to the Measures so wisely
<PB N="16" REF="009417_0009_0F743B1D35481748"/>
concerted? Finally, Who excited and animated so many of GOD's professing People, in this Land, and we trust also in our Mother Country, to pour out frequent and servent Prayers at the Mercy Seat, for the Smiles of Heaven on our military Operati∣ons? Doubtless, GOD is to be acknowledged and adored in all these Things. Yes, you may say; "The superintending and directing Providence of the Most High extends to all Events, and without Him not a Sparrow falls to the Ground; for GOD governs the whole World." He does so: But then in some of GOD's Works, there seems to be more evident and striking Marks of a divine Superinten∣dency and Conduct; and the Footsteps of Deity are more plainly visible: And here the Results of Battles, and the Events of War are to be ranked. These depend on so many fickle Uncertainties as to us, and so many Things that are evidently beyond the Reach of human Power, as to render the Hand of GOD the more conspicuous. When the Wind and the Weather, the various Elements and an un∣common Co-incidence of Circumstances, have con∣spired to favour our Enterprizes: When an Un∣jarring Harmony has subsisted among all Orders of Men concern'd: When they have all united in one View, in one grand Design: When a martial, he∣roic Ardor seem'd to glow in every Breast: When, though to a common Penetration, the Difficulties attending the most important and decisive Conquest, that of <HI>Quebec,</HI> and which was a Key to the Rest, seemed insuparable; yet the distinguish'd Leader,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WOLF.</NOTE> by a Sagacity lent him from Above, discern'd the
<PB N="17" REF="009417_0009_0F743B1D35481748"/>
Method, perhaps the only Method, in which, hu∣manly speaking, the Enemy could be overcome—discerned the Critical Moment, when it was pos∣sible to wrest a Victory—seized the happy Moment, and with a surprizing Presence of Mind, Wisdom and Courage that Nothing could disconcert or daunt, surmounted all difficulties, and carried his Plan into Execution: I say, when this is the Case, who will not say, not only, that the Hand of GOD was there; but that it was a wonderful Work of his Power and Goodness? And when GOD has been pleased to vouchsafe a remarkable Series, an unbro∣ken Chain of numerous Victories; what pious Mind can contemplate the important Events, without owning and adoring the Hand of Heaven?—with∣out being struck with a kind of Sacred Reverence of the Presence of GOD; and his glorious Perfecti∣ons, his Power, Wisdom, Goodness and Mercy so evidently conspicuous therein.</P>
<P>But that we may be the more sensible of the Goodness of GOD, and our Indebtedness to Him, for our late Successes, and present happy Settlement; it may be proper to take Notice of one or two Things, which plainly determine it a great Deli∣verance.</P>
<P>Let us consider, <HI>First,</HI> the Evils, which were thereby obviated and prevented. How wretched had our Situation been, if <HI>French</HI> Plans had succeded, and their ambitious Schemes been carried into Ex∣ecution? Had their Arms been succeded in <HI>Europe,</HI> according to their Design; what had been the Con∣sequence, with Regard to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but the overthrow of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Succession, a <HI>Popish</HI> Pre∣tender
<PB N="18" REF="009417_0010_0F743B1E26E7C338"/>
obtruded, and the Loss both of civil and re∣ligious Liberty, and the Kingdom being made a Scene of Desolation and Blood? And as to their Intentions in <HI>America,</HI> how dismal had been our Fate had they succeeded? By the Chain of Forts they had carried round us, and the Air, and Manner of their Operations, what less could they design, than our utter Ruin, and the wresting from us this goodly Heritage GOD gave to our Fathers?. And can we imagine to ourselves the execution of such their Design without Amazement and Horror?—Their Popish and Pagan Armies marching into the Heart of our Country, practising their imhuman Cruelties without Pity?—Without Distinction, butchering Men, Women and Children, in their triumphant Progress; involving our Habitations, Churches and Towns in devouring Flames; and deluging the Land with Slaughter and Blood; whilst the miserable Remnant, stript of all their precious Privileges, Civil and Religious, would be reduced to a State of the most wretched Slavery. How dis∣mal were such a State of Things! But GOD in great Mercy has prevented it.</P>
<P>The Pit they were digging for us, they are fallen into themselves: And the Mischief they were fram∣ing for us, GOD has brought down upon their own Heads: Their ambitious, towering Scheme, is dashed to Pieces; and their whole <HI>American</HI> Ter∣ritory almost, is given up; and by the present Settlement annexed to the <HI>British</HI> Crown. So won∣derfully has GOD delivered us.</P>
<P>Let us consider, <HI>nextly,</HI> the Worth and Value of these Acquisitions, thus secur'd to us; and the Evils
<PB N="19" REF="009417_0010_0F743B1E26E7C338"/>
we are like to be secur'd against, for the Time to come. 'Tis not easy to ascertain their Importance and value to the <HI>British</HI> Crown, and to these Pro∣vinces: They are, without Doubt, vastly valuable. The Conquest of all <HI>France,</HI> I imagine, would not have been equally so: For in that Case, it would be immensely chargeable to keep it; and in the End, perhaps <HI>Britain</HI> would become a Province of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In sundry Views, the Reduction of <HI>Canada,</HI> is justly accounted a very important Acquisition. It directly conduces to the future Security and Peace of these Colonies. What a bloody Scourge have the <HI>French</HI> Settlements in <HI>Canada</HI> been to these Pro∣vinces, from Generation to Generation? What horrid and inhuman Butcheries have been perpe∣trated? How much <HI>Protestant</HI> Blood has been shed upon our Frontiers, by the blood-thirsty <HI>Savages,</HI> spirited and set on by the faithless <HI>French?</HI> But these horrid Butcheries are, we hope, likely to be forever over and at an End.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The present in human and cruel Out-breakings of the Sa∣vages, we trust, will be of no long Continuance—that proper Measures will be concerted, for their being speedily and ef∣fectually suppress'd.</NOTE></P>
<P>Besides, what an immense Source of Wealth may this Acquisition prove; as it opens a most va∣luable Trade with the Natives, for a vast Extent of Territory round.—But to wave this, and pass to take in another Point of View, a very interesting and glorious one to a Christian. May we not hope, that these Events will serve to give the Savages some Impressions in Favour of the Gospel, the pure
<PB N="20" REF="009417_0011_0F743B20B1AB4948"/>
Gospel, unadulterated with <HI>popish</HI> Mixtures. Will not the Natives, after having considered and weigh∣ed these Things, be naturally led to say, as the <HI>Heathen</HI> did, with Regard to <HI>Israel,</HI> in Psalm cxxvi. 2. "Then said they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great Things for them." "The GOD of <HI>Britons</HI> and of <HI>Protestants</HI> has done great Things for them: He is a great GOD, and a mighty King." And may we not hope, that their Minds may thence receive some powerful Touch in Favour of the Blessed Gospel: And that a Way may be opened for the spreading the glorious Gospel among them; and their being brought to a professed and cordial Subjection to the Prince of Peace: That so, in these dark Corners of the Earth, where Satan's Seat from Time immemorial has been, the Churches of CHRIST may be erected, and his Gospel and Reli∣gion taught; and Multitudes of Souls train'd up for the Kingdom of Heaven. What a blessed, glo∣rious Event would this be, if CHRIST the King of <HI>Zion</HI> should then take to himself his great Power and Reign! But I need say Nothing further, to give you an Impression of the Greatness of the De∣liverance and Salvation mercifully granted us of GOD. "The LORD is our Strength, and he is become our Salvation." Our Covenant GOD, and the GOD of our Fathers has done this; the GOD that brought our Fathers into this Land, and planted them here; who watched over them in the Days of their small Things; who planted his Church here, and still defends and cherishes that Vine which his own right Hand had planted. 'Tis He that has fought our Battles for us, and
<PB N="21" REF="009417_0011_0F743B20B1AB4948"/>
triumphed gloriously. 'Tis He that has carried us on from Victory to Victory, to the present hap∣py Settlement. Let a Sense of this ever be found warm at our Hearts, and let us feel the Obligati∣ons we are under of Love and Homage, of Gra∣titude, Thanksgiving and Praise to the GOD of all our Salvations. Wherefore,</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Let us offer unto God Thanksgiving, and praise his Name.</HI> This is the Duty we are now call'd to: Let us see to it, it be done aright. Our Hearts should be impress'd with a deep Sense of the good∣ness and salvation of GOD; and they should act and flow out in the warmest and most cordial Gra∣titude to the Supreme Ruler, and our Celestial Be∣nefactor. To engage us to the acceptable Discharge of this Duty, let us consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This is a most fit and reasonable Thing.</HI> 'Tis our treating GOD and acting towards Him, as being what he is; infinitely the best of Beings, and the glorious Source and Spring of all our Salvations. When we sincerely ascribe our public Successes, our Victories and Triumphs, and in Consequence of these, our present Settlement, to GOD; we ascribe them to their true Source and Original. And this, to∣gether with correspondent Gratitude and Thanks∣giving to the Most High, is most reasonable, fit and right; for unto GOD the Honor and Praise do belong.</P>
<P>Men can claim no other Honor from such E∣vents, than what belongs to moral Instruments, the Honor of having faithfully employed their dis∣tinguished Talents for the Good of Mankind. In this View, our wise Counsellors and Politicians,
<PB N="22" REF="009417_0012_0F743B217667FE68"/>
our heroic Chiefs and Commanders, and our brave Soldiers too, justly come in for their Share of Praise. A Tribute of Honor and Praise is due to them from a preserved and grateful Country. But as they were raised up by GOD, and furnished with their various Talents, and spirited and call'd forth to the Exertion of them, for the Welfare and Salvation of their Country, by GOD; so the Praise and Glo∣ry are ultimately due to him. Bless the LORD, O our Souls, and all that is within us, praise his ho∣ly Name: This is reasonable, fit and right.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This is delightful to serious and pious Minds.</HI> True Devotion is the most noble and delightful Exercise of a reasonable Creature. A fixed and governing Habit of Devotion, is the truest Ornament and Glory of a Man: And sincere Gratitude and Thanks∣giving is the most animating Part of Devotion: It warms and exalts the Soul, with noble and affecting Conceptions of the Atributes of the De∣ity, display'd for the Good of Mankind. And when whole Countries and Kingdoms are relieved and made happy, the more elevated and delightful must be the Views of the pious and devout, of the Goodness and Mercy, the Wisdom and Power of GOD; whence all their public Salvations result. I might add here, this Branch of Devotion is no less honorable to GOD, than it is delightful to good Men. GOD himself takes Pleasure in seeing his reasonable Creatures rejoicing in his Goodness, and in Himself the Author of all their Salvation: Yes, it is honorable and pleasing to the most high GOD, to see whole Provinces and Kingdoms kneeling before him, and sincerely ascribing the Praise and
<PB N="23" REF="009417_0012_0F743B217667FE68"/>
Glory of all their public Salvations and Blessings to Him. Permit me then to say, as the <HI>Levites</HI> did to the Congregation of <HI>Israel,</HI> on another Occasion, "Stand up and bless the LORD your GOD forever and ever, and blessed be thy glorious Name, which is exalted above all Blessing and Praise." Nehem. ix. 5.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sincere and Heart-felt Gratitude, on this Occasi∣on, has a Tendency to make us, as a People, more vir∣tuous and religious.</HI> It tends to meliorate the Heart, and make the Life better. True Devotion con∣duces to improve and strengthen, in the Heart, every Principle of Virtue and Holiness. A reve∣rent and grateful Sense of GOD and his Goodness, prevailing in the Heart, naturally discovers itself in a Care and Endeavour to please and honor Him. A due Sense of the Loving kindness and Mercy of the LORD, tends to melt and fill the Heart with a Sense of our own Unworthiness, and to prompt us, from a Principle of Gratitude, to please and serve the GOD of all our Salvations: So that our public Solemnities of Thanksgiving and Praise, if rightly attended, tend to diffuse and spread a Spirit of Devotion and Piety through the Land, and to animate and stir up People to lead Lives of Holi∣ness and Obedience—to make us a better People, more virtuous, holy and religious, more careful to maintain good Works, and to do whatsoever GOD has commanded us. Let us then, with all our Hearts, offer unto GOD Thanksgiving and bless his holy Name. And so I am prepared to say,</P>
<P>V. <HI>We are to pay our Vows to the Most High.</HI> "Of∣fer unto GOD Thanksgiving, and pay thy Vows
<PB N="24" REF="009417_0013_0F743B21C8790970"/>
unto the Most High." We are, in sundry Views, under strongest Obligations to make suitable Re∣turns to GOD, for all his Goodness and Mercy.</P>
<P>Shall I call to your Remembrance, this Day, our solemn Transactions with GOD, in that gloomy Season, presently after Fort <HI>William-Henry</HI> was ta∣ken and destroyed by the <HI>French;</HI> and the Aspects of Providence seemed so very dark and threatning; when we thought it our Duty, to set apart a Day for solemn Humiliation and Prayer before GOD: You may perhaps remember, the Words treated on, on that Occasion, were those in <HI>Judges</HI> x. 15. "We have sinned, do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee, deliver us only, we pray thee this Day." Were you not ready, in that Season of Dis∣tress, to fall down before GOD; and in the Bitter∣ness of your Souls to confess your Sin, your Guilt and evil Deserts; and to implore Protection and Deliverance, on what Terms GOD pleased? "De∣liver us only this Day from our Enemies, and pu∣nish us in what other Way thou wilt for our Sins: Send Sickness, send Pestilence, send Blasting and Fa∣mine if thou wilt; let us fall into the Hands of the living GOD, and not into the Hands of unreasona∣ble Men; not into the Hands of our cruel and bloody Enemies." Were you not ready to pros∣trate yourselves before the Mercy-Seat, and seriously to promise and vow to the Most High, and Cove∣nant with Him, that if He would deliver and save you, you would be his faithful Servants forever; would devote yourselves wholly to Him, to walk before Him and to keep his Commandments all the Days of your Lives: And if you did not
<PB N="25" REF="009417_0013_0F743B21C8790970"/>
do so, were ready to own, you should be the most guilty and inexcusable Creatures imaginable. Well, GOD did appear for us and deliver us: He has sa∣ved us with a mighty Salvation; carried us with Success and Victory, thro' the War, and brought us to this happy Period of it: Now then we must pay our Vows to the Most High—our Vows of Gratitude and Love, of Homage and sincere Obe∣dience. The devout <HI>Psalmist</HI> says in Psalm lxvi. 13, 14. "I will go into thy House with Burnt Offer∣ings: And will pay thee my Vows, which my Lips have uttered, and my Mouth hath spoken, when I was in Trouble."</P>
<P>We are not to forget our solemn Transactions with GOD in Years past; but must still hold them in Remembrance; and render unto GOD according to all the Benefits we have receiv'd. But, whether we formally and explicitly made Vows and Pro∣mises to GOD, in the Season of our Distress, or not; was not something like this implied, in the Solemn Prayers and Supplications we pour'd out in GOD's House, from Time to Time?—And I may add, I hope, in our Families and in our Clo∣sets too? What was the Import and Meaning of those Prayers? Was it not plainly implied, in all that Variety of Phrase and Expression, that might be made Use of from Time to Time?—That we humbly beg'd Deliverance, Success in the War, and a final happy Settlement and Peace, at the Hand of GOD; sensible that GOD only could be∣stow these Blessings; that if He should be pleased to bestow them, it would be all Mercy, rich un∣merited Mercy and Grace; and that it should be
<PB N="26" REF="009417_0014_0F743B2272DB39E0"/>
regarded, resented and improved by us as such; and we should hold ourselves bound and obliged to make all proper Returns to the GOD of all our Salvations? These then are the Returns we are now bound to make, to bless and praise the Name of GOD; and to express our Gratitude by Lives of Holiness and New Obedience.</P>
<P>Besides, we may by no Means forget, that as we are the professing People of GOD, we are under Covenant Obligations, to walk with GOD according to his Word; and to make a right Use and Im∣provement not only of his Word and Ordinances, but likewise of all the Dispensations of his Pro∣vidence. Yes, we are under solemn covenant Ob∣ligations to improve the Salvation and Mercy we now celebrate, so as to be induced thence to conse∣crate ourselves, all our Powers and Faculties, our Time and Talents to GOD, to his Service and Glo∣ry. O let us not fail, on this Occasion, to answer the Obligations, we are under to GOD; and with glad and devout Hearts, to pay our Vows to the Most High. I must add in the</P>
<P>VI. Place, <HI>We must now glorify GOD.</HI> "I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." No Crea∣ture can glorify GOD, by making any Addition to his essential Glory; or by making GOD any more glorious than he really is. It is beyond the Reach or Capacity of Men or Angels, to make GOD any more really Glorious than he always was, and al∣ways will be; for he is infinitely perfect, infinitely glorious, independently of all Creatures: But we glorify GOD, declaratively or manifestively, when we manifest or shew forth his Glory: When we
<PB N="27" REF="009417_0014_0F743B2272DB39E0"/>
think, speak, act and live so as speaks and declares GOD to be glorious: Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We are to glorify GOD, by entertaining high and honorable Tho'ts of Him.</HI> We must remove from our Apprehensions of GOD, every Thing that implies Imperfection; and conceive of Him, as a Being of infinite Perfection and Glory. All possible, in∣finite Perfections and Excellencies must meet in our Idea of GOD: And we must conceive of Him, as the first and infinitely the greatest and best of Be∣ings. We think honorably of GOD, when we re∣ally think and conceive of Him to be, what he re∣ally is, infinitely glorious. Particularly, we must entertain very high and admiring Thoughts of those Perfections of the Deity, his Wisdom, Power, Co∣venant Faithfulness, his Pity and Compassion, his Goodness, Grace and Mercy, that have been emi∣nently displayed in working Salvation for us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We are to glorify GOD by proper and suitable Affec∣tions and Actings of Soul towards Him.</HI> By heartily believing the Revelations He has made of Himself in his Word; by reverencing the Operations of his Hand, in his Works of Providence; by trust∣ing in Him, through the Mediator, for all the Blessings of Time and Eternity; by loving GOD, the best of Beings, with all our Hearts and with all our Souls; and by being effectually induc'd by all that Goodness and Mercy, in which he has pas∣sed before us, to take up our complacential ever∣lasting Rest in GOD, to delight ourselves in Him, as our Portion, and the Object of our Supreme Felicity. In a Word, every grateful and devout Temper of Mind, suitable and adapted to the great
<PB N="28" REF="009417_0015_0F743B23429A5220"/>
Things GOD has done for us, should be call'd forth into flourishing Exercise, to the Honor and Glory of GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We must glorify GOD, by speaking reverently and honorably of Him and to Him.</HI> It is infinite Condescen∣tion in the great GOD, to let Himself down to us: And it becomes us to take his Sacred Name into our Lips, with greatest Humility and Reverence: Es∣pecially on this Occasion does it become us, to pour out through our Lips, the warmest Gratitude of our Hearts to the Father of Mercy, and our great Deliverer and Benefactor, and by offering Praise and Thanksgiving to glorify Him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>We are to glorify GOD, by Lives devoted to Him.</HI> "By adorning the Doctrine of GOD our Saviour in all Things; and making our Light shine be-Men that seeing our good Works, they may glo∣rify our Father which is in Heaven." By worship∣ing and serving GOD according to his Appoint∣ment: By practising Justice, Love and Charity to our Fellow-Men; and by Humility, Meekness and Purity in all our Behaviour. We are to glorify GOD, by improving our Time and Talents well; and by bringing forth Fruit, in Proportion to the Means and Advantages we enjoy. In a Word, we are to glorify GOD, by living and conducting our∣selves in such a Manner, that the natural and ge∣nuine Language of the whole Tenor of our Con∣duct and Deportment may be, that GOD is such an infinitely glorious Being, as he has revealed Him∣self to be in His Word. Let us now make some IMPROVEMENT of this Subject. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us seriously enquire, how we have been affected
<PB N="29" REF="009417_0015_0F743B23429A5220"/>
and influenced, in Heart and Life, by all God's various Dealings with us, in the Course of his Providence, from the Time when the late War opened to the present Day? And be persuaded, in Obedience to the present Call of divine Goodness and Mercy, speedily to reform and amend what∣soever is still to be found amiss in us, or among us.</HI> GOD has been passing before us of late Years, by terrible Things in Righteousness: He has likewise caused his Goodness and Mercy, in remarkable, wonder∣ful Instances of it, to pass before us: And by all, He has been calling upon us, loudly and long cal∣ling upon us; to consider, to repent, to reform and turn to GOD and our Duty. And what Influence have all GOD's Calls, and all the Means He has been using with us, had to effect and bring about a Reformation? Are we, in Consequence of all, become a reformed, and truly religious People? Are we in any Measure—in any considerable Mea∣sure reformed? Some particular Persons, I doubt not, have repented and turned to GOD; it would be sad indeed if none had: But has there been any Thing like a general Reformation effected, by all GOD has been doing with us▪ Is there not as much—is there not more Sin in the Land, than when the War began? What one Sin is generally bro∣ken off and forsaken? Truly, I fear, not so much as one. Are we more pious, godly and devout than we used to be? Do we prize God's Word, Day and Ordinances more? Are we more strict and exemplary in all the Branches of Piety, than formerly? Are we more just, kind, charatable, peaceful and forgiving, with Regard to Men? Has a Reformation been carried on in our Families? Is
<PB N="30" REF="009417_0016_0F743B23F8EC24C0"/>
Family Religion reviv'd among us? In a Word, Do we live and conduct ourselves more, as it be∣comes the Disciples and Followers of the blessed JESUS, than we used to do? I much fear, but lit∣tle of this can be answered in the Affirmative: 'Tis too plain we are yet a sinful People; and there are many dark and threatning Symptoms upon us. Let us, without Delay, take our Case into serious Consideration, and receive Conviction of the Ne∣cessity we are under, of a thorough Reformation. If GOD'S awful Rod has not driven you; let his great Goodness and Mercy lead you to Repentance: And do not, after your Hardness and impenitent Hearts, treasure up to yourselves Wrath against the Day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the righ∣teous Judgments of GOD. It is a dreadful Thing to remain hardened and impenitent under all GOD'S various Dealings with you, for your Reformation. O be persuaded to break off every known Sin, and to turn, with all your Hearts, to GOD in CHRIST; and enter, without Delay upon a Life of strict Re∣ligion and real Godliness. Let a grateful Sense of the unmerited Goodness of God, effectually engage you, to make all proper and suitable Returns to Him, and to live to the Praise and Glory of the GOD of all your Salvations.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us be persuaded to the steady Practice of those Virtues and Rules of Prudence, that are conducive to the public Welfare, Strength and Tranquility.</HI> As for the present Peace, may it be lasting as it is welcome, and may Generations yet unborn, rejoice in the happy Consequences of it. And in this Season of Tran∣quility and Repose, it concerns us to turn our At∣tention
<PB N="31" REF="009417_0016_0F743B23F8EC24C0"/>
to such Things, as tend to render us a hap∣py and flourishing People. The political Precauti∣ons that may be proper at this Juncture, being out of my Province, I leave to those, who have the Conduct and Management of our public Af∣fairs: But the improvement and Cultivation of moral Dispositions and social Virtues, must always be proper to be recommended from this Place. If we consider, how much we are exhausted, by the Length and Expensiveness of the War;—how bur∣dened with Debts, and how many Individuals in the Colony are sunk, or sinking apace under the Burden: It seems proper to call to Mind, the Ne∣cessity of checking and discouraging, a Spirit of Prodigality and Expensive Vanity; which in the natural Train of Things tend to sink us into Po∣verty and Disgrace: And of promoting and culti∣vating Tranquility, Prudence and Industry, and a Method of living according to our Station and A∣bility: This would have a happy Tendency to ren∣der us a flourishing People. 'Tis like wise of high Importance, that we apply ourselves to the diligent Practice of all social Virtues and Duties:—That we studiously shun and avoid all injurious Treat∣ment of Mankind—all Strife and Contention; and every Thing that has a Tendency to breed mutual Alienation, Disgust and Ill-will; and that we practise Equity and Moderation, Kindness, Cha∣rity and Beneficence, and every proper Art of mu∣tual Indearment; and that we live together in un∣ruffled Peace, Friendship, Love and Harmony: This would be our Strength, our Beauty and our Glory. 'Tis proper to observe further, that hard∣ly
<PB N="32" REF="009417_0017_0F743B24B3C4E630"/>
any Thing more directly and effectually conduces to the Strength, Firmness and Prosperity of a State or People, than a Public Spirit, and a generous Regard to the Good of the Whole; and a Sub∣ordinating our private Views and Interest to the Welfare of the Public: A Sense of this should be fixed deep in our Hearts. Permit me also to re∣mind you, on this Occasion, of how great Impor∣tance it is to the Welfare of the Community, that a wise and diligent Care be taken of the Education of Youth; that they be trained up in the Way, in which they ought to go; that so they may become Worthy Members, not only of the Churches of CHRIST, but of the Civil State. They should be form'd betimes to a Veneration and Reverence for Laws, both Human and Divine; and for all law∣ful Authority in Family, in Church and State—to Industry, Diligence and Frugality; to every soci∣al and amiable Virtue; and to every Temper and Practice that tend to render them Blessings in the World: That so, when their Fathers fall asleep, a Generation may arise, who shall shine as Lights in the World, and mark their Way through Life with worthy and laudable Actions, to another and bet∣ter World.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us be persuaded, from the Occasion of the pre∣sent Solemnity, to look forward with Hope and Joy and Trust in God, to that State of Purity and Peace, the Church of Christ expects in the latter Day; and to the complete and endless Purity and Peace of the Heavenly World.</HI> 'Tis painful to a pious and benevolent Mind to con∣sider the Miseries and Calamities Mankind have groan∣ed under, from Generation to Generation, ever since
<PB N="33" REF="009417_0017_0F743B24B3C4E630"/>
the Entrance of Sin into the World. Bloody Wars and Devastations, and Mankind pursuing and de∣vouring one another like Beasts of Prey; make up a great Part of the History of past Ages: And whence come Wars and Fightings upon the Earth? They come from the Ambition and Lusts of Men: And will the Ambition and Lusts of Men always prevail to such a Degree, as to drive Peace in a Manner, from the Earth; and render this lower World a Stage of Calamity and Misery, an Acel∣dama, a Field of Blood? Will Satan, the god of this World, always prevail, to lead ignorant, stupid Mankind captive to their Ruin; and, as it were, go off the Stage victorious? This can hardly be thought: No, the Prince of Peace, is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah: He has bruised the Serpent's Head; and led Captivity captive: And He will assert the Conquest He has gained over the Powers of Darkness: He must reign and triumph; and His Cause will finally prevail: His Kingdom of Truth and Righteousness and Peace, will be glori∣ously set up, on the Ruins of Satan's Kingdom. A Period, a long and happy Period of a Thousand Years, is justly expected; when Satan shall be bound, and the Gospel of CHRIST shall be universally spread over all the Nations of the Earth; and the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the LORD, as the Waters cover the Sea; and Mankind in general through the Earth, in some good Degree, shall be conform'd in Heart and Life, to the Gospel and Temper of JESUS: The glorious Gospel will pow∣erfully prevail, to the disarming their fierce Passi∣ons; regulating their exorbitant Desires, and in∣spiring
<PB N="34" REF="009417_0018_0F743B278D9DFA28"/>
the most kindly and benevolent Sentiments: Hence, once for all, they will beat their Swords into Plow Shares, and their Spears into Pruning Hooks; and they will learn War no more: But Mankind, being united in the Sacred Bands of the Gospel Charity, will dwell together in Love, in Peace and undisturb'd Tranquility. This blessed Period, 'tis probable, will not come on, till we are dead and forgotten in the Earth: Yet ought we not, by Faith in the Word of GOD, to look forward to that Day, with Pleasure and Joy; and earnestly breathe after that Purity and Holiness, that Peace and Joy, which will then bless the Earth. But es∣pecially does it concern us, to look forward with Faith and Hope and Joy, to the complete and end∣less Peace and Purity of the Heavenly World: Where there will be no Sin, nor Trouble, no War nor Uneasiness; but all will be Purity, Peace and Happiness. This blessed State, if we are the faith∣ful Servants of CHRIST, we may justly expect; and it cannot be far off; for Death is hastening upon us. This is that glorious Rest, which GOD, of his un∣bounded Goodness and Grace, has prepared for all good Men. The Holiness, the Joy and Glory of that World, far exceed our present Thoughts: "Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nor have en∣tered into the Heart of Man, the Things GOD has prepared for them that love Him." 'Tis of much greater Importance to us, that we diligently pre∣pare for that World; than that we attempt to dis∣cribe it. Let us see to it, that the Gospel has it's sanctifying and saving Influence upon our Hearts and Lives; that we are accepted in the Beloved;
<PB N="35" REF="009417_0018_0F743B278D9DFA28"/>
and intitled to the Heavenly Felicity; and that we act and live, as it becomes the Candidates for such a Kingdom and World; and the Disciples and Followers of the blessed JESUS: That we enjoy the solid Evidences of the special Love and Favour of GOD, and that Peace of GOD possess our Hearts, which passeth Understanding.</P>
<P>Let it be our Care, to live in Peace; in our Fa∣milies, in our Neighbourhood, and with Mankind around us: And that we improve and flourish, more and more in the divine Life; and grow up by happy and swift Advances to a Me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ness for a better World; ardently aspiring and breathing after the complete Purity, Rest and Happiness of that State: So when we shall be call'd off from these Regions of Guilt and Misery, of War and Blood∣shed; we shall ascend to those peaceful, blissful Realms on High; where no Sin will ever pollute; no Enemy will ever molest; but all will be Peace and Joy and endless Tranquility.</P>
