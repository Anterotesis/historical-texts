<P>True Piety THE BEST POLICY For Times of WAR. A SERMON Preacht at <HI>Boston</HI>-Lecture on <HI>August</HI> 16. 1722. soon after a DECLARATION of WAR, against the <HI>Eastern Indians</HI> &amp; <HI>Rebels.</HI></P>

<P>If ye walk in my sta∣tutes, and keep my commandments and do them, — ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. And I will give peace in the land, &amp; ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid,— neither shall the sword go thro' your land And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, and so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant — I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you, and ye shall flee when none persueth.</P></Q>

<P>When the Host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE words are a divine direction, given to a covenant professing People of GOD. In the Words, we have one thing <HI>supposed,</HI> viz. <HI>That a professing people are sometimes obligd to go forth to War a∣gainst their enemies.</HI> We have another thing <HI>commanded,</HI> viz. <HI>When they do so, they should keep themselves from every wicked thing.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="002400_0004_0FDB3A6808CBF018"/>1. WE have one thing <HI>supposed,</HI> viz. <HI>That a professing people are sometimes obliged to go forth to War against their enemies.</HI> GOD's People sometimes have enemies molesting, disturbing, assaulting of them; striving to rob and spoil 'em of their substance, &amp; to captivate or destroy their Persons. As Mens <HI>carnal minds are enmity a∣gainst God,</HI> (Rom. 8.7.) so they naturally are a∣gainst one another also. Man's fallen, corrupt nature, is <HI>deceitful above all things and desperate∣ly wicked</HI>; it contains the Seed and root of all manner of wickedness against Men, as well as of Irreligion towards GOD. Out of Mens wicked hearts, proceed <HI>evil Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Murders,</HI> Mat. 15.19. Unregenerate wicked Men, are the <HI>Chil∣dren of the Devil, his lusts they will do</HI>; and he's <HI>a Murderer from the beginning,</HI> Joh. 8.44. Mens hearts are naturally <HI>full of all unrighteousness, wickedness, maliciousness, envy, murder, debate, malignity; they're implacable, unmerciful,</HI> Rom. 1.29—31. In their flesh there dwells no good thing; and what are the works of the flesh? Why these are some of 'em. Gal. 5.20, 21. <HI>Hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, en∣vyings, murders.</HI> Men under the reigning power of Sin, how do they live? Hear what the A∣postle says: Tit. 3.3. <HI>We our selves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hatefull and hating one another.</HI> Such car∣riage among Men, is the genuine product of cor∣rupt nature where it prevail, and reigns. Jam. 4.1. <HI>From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts that
<PB N="3" REF="002400_0005_0FDB3A69DDB54920"/>
war in your members.</HI> The prevalency of Men's cursed lusts, often produceth <HI>quarrellings, fightings</HI> between <HI>particular Persons,</HI> in <HI>Families,</HI> and be∣tween <HI>Countreys, Kingdoms, Nations.</HI> Wicked Nations are often enemies to and they often War against one another. And some or other of such Nations, are often open enemies to GOD's pro∣fessing People, seeking to spoil, subdue and over∣throw them. This truth is so plain from Scrip∣ture and experience, that I need not say any thing for the demonstrating of it.</P>
<P>AND when GOD's People are assaulted, mo∣lested, threatened with ruin by their enemies; they're oblig'd to stand on their own defence, and to indeavour the conquering of those, who unjustly strive to conquer and destroy them. GOD has sometimes expressly <HI>commanded</HI> His People, to fight against and destroy their wicked enemies. GOD said to <HI>Moses</HI> concerning <HI>Sihon</HI> King of the <HI>Amorites</HI>; Deut. 2.24. <HI>Contend with him in Bat∣tle.</HI> GOD gave an express command to King <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 Sam. 15.3. <HI>Now go and smite Amatek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not.</HI> There are <HI>Wars of the Lord,</HI> (Numb. 21.14. 1 Chron. 5.22.) and <HI>Battels of the Lord,</HI> (1 Sam. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.28.) and a <HI>Curse</HI> has been denounc'd against some, <HI>for not coming to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty,</HI> Judg. 5.23. It's as reasonable, and often as necessary in <HI>these dayes,</HI> as it was in <HI>former ones</HI>; for GOD's Peo∣ple to fight against, and indeavour to subdue and destroy, their wicked enemies. They're indeed sometimes, yea often, oblig'd to send forth their
<PB N="4" REF="002400_0006_0FDB3A6CF31C4638"/>
<HI>Host,</HI> their <HI>Armies</HI> to fight against their wicked unrighteous enemies.</P>
<P>BUT thus much may suffice for the thing <HI>supposed</HI> in our Text, viz. <HI>That a professing People are sometimes oblig'd to go forth to War against their enemies.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WE have another thing <HI>commanded,</HI> viz. <HI>When they do so, they should keep themselves from every wicked thing.</HI> When GOD's People are in∣gag'd in War, <HI>then</HI> they should keep themselves from every wicked thing. <HI>Then,</HI> it is not to be taken <HI>exclusively of other times,</HI> as thô at other times they might Indulge themselves in wicked practices: no Indeed, for they <HI>should</HI> continually, <HI>perpetually</HI> keep themselves from every wicked thing. But <HI>then</HI> especially they should be care∣ful to shun all wickedness, when their <HI>Host goes forth to War</HI>; lest by Indulging any wickedness, they should provoke GOD to frown on, and fight against them. We have general Precepts, <HI>Pray always, Pray without ceasing. Continuing Instant in Prayer,</HI> Eph. 6.18.1 Thes 5.17. Rom. 12.12. Yet GOD more particularly says, <HI>Call on me in the day of trouble,</HI> If any be <HI>afflicted let him pray,</HI> Psal. 50.15. Jam. 5.13. In our <HI>affliction we should seek God early.</HI> So that we should Pray <HI>always,</HI> and yet especially &amp; peculiarly apply our selves to this duty in time of <HI>Trouble &amp; Affliction.</HI> So, we should be <HI>always</HI> careful to avoid every wicked thing; and should yet be peculiarly and especi∣ally careful to avoid it, when <HI>Ingaged in War</HI> against our enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002400_0007_0FDB3A6EB944B888"/>WHEN the Host goeth forth against thine enemies, <HI>then</HI> keep thee from every wicked thing. It may Imply,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT in time of War, Persons are in pe∣culiar danger of Indulging themselves in vicious practices. Souldiers</HI> are apt to give themselves such a loose, to take such a liberty in unbecoming Words and Actions; which possibly they would be <HI>asham'd</HI> or <HI>afraid</HI> to do, if at home and among their usual Neighbours. Almost every condition and business of Life, has it's special or peculiar Snares and Temptations attending of it; a <HI>Souldier</HI>'s calling is attended with very great and dangerous ones. Thô <HI>Souldiers</HI> have strong <HI>Ob∣ligations</HI> to be <HI>Singularly Pious,</HI> yet they have strong <HI>Temptations</HI> also to be very <HI>wicked</HI>; and they're frequently and shamefully overcome by their Temptations. <HI>John Baptist</HI> seems to have caution'd <HI>Souldiers,</HI> against the evils they were most <HI>peculiarly</HI> in danger of committing; for when they ask'd him, saying, <HI>What shall we do?</HI> He reply'd, <HI>Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages.</HI> Luk. 3.14. So that the <HI>peculiar danger</HI> of Indulging wickedness, in <HI>time of War,</HI> might be one occasi∣on of this special command, <HI>then</HI> keep thee from every wicked thing. It may Imply,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE very <HI>great Importance and Necessity,</HI> of keeping our selves from every wicked thing <HI>in time of War.</HI> A <HI>wicked thing,</HI> What is that? Why it's any thing, every thing that's <HI>contrary to God's Law.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.4. <HI>Whosoever committeth Sin transgresseth also the Law, for Sinis a trans∣gression
<PB N="6" REF="002400_0008_0FDB3A704557EB80"/>
of the Law.</HI> Every thing that's contrary to GOD's Law, is <HI>Wicked, Sinful,</HI> and therefore hateful and loathsome to GOD. For <HI>Sin</HI> is the <HI>abominable thing whith He hates,</HI> Jer. 44.4. He is <HI>of purer eyes than to behold evil, he cannot look upon Iniquity,</HI> Hab. 1.13. And this Infinitely great and glorious GOD to whom <HI>Sin is so hate∣ful.</HI> He orders, over-rules, governs all things as He will; even all things in the <HI>Armies of Hea∣ven and among the Inhabitants of the earth, none can stay his hand, or say unto him, what doest thou?</HI> Dan. 4.35. Victories and Defeats in Battle, even all events of Peace &amp; War, are Intirely at GODS dispose, He orders them as He will. Therefore it highly becomes a professing People Ingag'd in War, to keep in good terms with GOD, to keep themselves from every wicked thing; lest other∣wise they should provoke Him to appear and fight against them. If they fight against Him by their Sins, they may justly fear that He'll fight against them in His Providence. There∣fore, when the Host goeth forth against thine enemies, then <HI>keep thee</HI> from every wicked thing. <HI>Keep thee,</HI> this may refer both to the <HI>Souldiers that go forth to War,</HI> and to <HI>the rest of the People that stay at home.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO the Souldiers that go forth to War.</HI> Those who go out to War, go in danger of their lives. It's true, if we stay at home, live in peace, seem to be most safe and secure and free from danger, yet we're liable to Death. Some grievous Sick∣ness, sudden fit, or unexpected accident may in a little while turn us out of the World. Prov.
<PB N="7" REF="002400_0009_0FDB3A71CEAC1698"/>
27.1. <HI>Boast not thy self of to-morrow, thou know∣est not what a day may bring forth.</HI> Jam. 4.14. <HI>Ye know not what shall be on the morrow: for what is your life? It is even a vapour that appears for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</HI> Thô all Persons are thus liable to Death, and they know not how soon of suddenly it may overtake them; yet those who <HI>go out to War,</HI> are in <HI>more apparent</HI> eminent danger of their lives. They <HI>Jeopard their lives to the Death in the high places of the Field,</HI> Judg. 5.18. They <HI>put their lives in their bands,</HI> as 'tis said of <HI>Jeptha</HI> and of <HI>David</HI> when they went forth <HI>to Battle,</HI> Judg. 12.3. I Sam. 19.5. When Persons are Ingag'd in Battle, thô they're never so <HI>Healthy, Stout, Strong,</HI> yet they know not but that the <HI>Sword, Spear, Hatchet</HI> or <HI>Bullet</HI> of the enemy may dispatch 'em in a Moment, and send their Souls to an endless Eternity. Surely, Persons in such danger, if they will but think, consider, and shew themselves Men, must needs reckon they're strongly oblig'd to <HI>keep themselves from every wicked thing.</HI> They should keep themselves not only from <HI>Robbing, Stealing, Profane Cursing and Swearing Drunken∣ness,</HI> and such gross Scandalous Transgressions, but even <HI>from all known Sins</HI> as much as possible, whether <HI>Open</HI> or <HI>Secret,</HI> of <HI>Omission</HI> or <HI>Commission,</HI> whether more Immediately against GOD, or more Immediately against Men. Their Military con∣dition, Circumstances and Services, can't weaken their obligations to Obey that GOD who is a <HI>Man of War, the God of Armies, the Lord of Hosts, the Captain of their Salvation,</HI> Exod. 13.3. 1 Sam. 17.45. Heb. 2.10. They should not dare to In∣dulge
<PB N="8" REF="002400_0010_0FDB3A75ED70D7D0"/>
themselves in any known wickedness, in any thing displeasing and provoking to GOD; therefore they should not dare to Indulge them∣selves in <HI>Impenitence</HI> or <HI>Unbelief,</HI> than which no∣thing can be more provoking to GOD, or hurt∣ful to themselves. Luk. 13.5. <HI>Except ye repent ye shall perish.</HI> Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth not, shall be damned.</HI> They should therefore be most speedy, hearty, sincere in Repenting of all their Sins, in Believing &amp; Trusting in JESUS CHRIST our LORD for Pardon and Salvation. This, even this is the great, indispensable, most necessary and profitable Duty Incumbent on all that are acquainted with the Gospel; and it can't be neg∣lected by professed Christians going out to War, without the highest madness and folly that can be. It's extreamly unsafe, to go out to War with the guilt of all our manifold, aggravated Transgressions lying on our Souls. If we fight against Men with our <HI>Bodies,</HI> and against GOD by our <HI>Sins,</HI> our danger is unutterable, inconcea∣ble. <HI>Who ever harden'd himself against God, and prosperd</HI>? Job 9.3. <HI>Do we provoke the Lord to Jealousy, are we stronger than he</HI>? 1 Cor. 10.22. What, shall we set briars and thorns in Battle array against GOD? Shall we dare to run on the thick <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of His Buckler? We are but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our own destruction, while by our Sins we're provoking an Infinitely Holy and Power∣ful GOD. It's true, <HI>If GOD be for us, who can be against us</HI>? Rom. 8.3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But on the other hand, if <HI>GOD be against us,</HI> if He's our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for our continuing in Sin (for He <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Psal. 5.5.) then
<PB N="9" REF="002400_0011_0FDB3A77B79CD4E8"/>
who can be for us? Who can protect and de∣fend us, and render us safe? Surely none can. Those therefore who go to <HI>fight against Men,</HI> should take utmost care to be <HI>at Peace with GOD,</HI> Those who Jeopard their lives in the high places of the Field (or on the Seas) should be most careful to keep themselves from every wicked thing, most careful that they dont fight against GOD by their Sins. They should to be sure be sincere &amp; vigorous in the exercise of every Grace, in the practice of every Duty; that so they may please and glorify that GOD, whose favour is most needful for them; even that GOD, <HI>in whose favour is life, and whose loving kindness is better than life,</HI> Psal. 30.5. &amp; 63.3. I might further say, those who go forth to War, should take <HI>ut∣most care</HI> to be <HI>at Peace with GOD,</HI> to <HI>avoid whatever provokes Him,</HI> and to do all they can to <HI>Please</HI> Him, for</P>
<P N="1">1. IT's GOD alone can <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 'em <HI>Skill, Wis∣dom, Prudence</HI> rightly to manage the Military business they're Ingag'd in. Some <HI>Skill</HI> &amp; <HI>Pru∣dence</HI> is needful for the right managing of any business whatsoever; and none but GOD, the <HI>Father of Lights</HI> and <HI>Fountain of wisdom,</HI> can give it. 'Tis said of the <HI>Husbandman</HI>: Isai. 28.26. <HI>His GOD doth Instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.</HI> Dan. 2.21. — <HI>He giveth Wis∣dom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know Understanding.</HI> There's much <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI> needful, for a due managing of <HI>Military Matters,</HI> and GOD alone can <HI>give</HI> it, for He's the <HI>Giver of every good gift,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am. 1.17. <HI>David</HI> was won∣derfully
<PB N="10" REF="002400_0012_0FDB3A7945ACD9B0"/>
furnish'd with <HI>Military Skill</HI> (as well as courage) and he thankfully ador'd GOD as the Author of it. Psal. 144.1. <HI>Blessed be the Lord my Strength, who teacheth my hands to War, and my fingers to Fight.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT's GOD alone can preserve their Health.</HI> Warlike exercises require <HI>healthy Bodies</HI>; it can't be expected that <HI>Sickly Souldiers</HI> should do much. Well, Souldiers are sometimes <HI>crouded in Heaps,</HI> as it were, in <HI>Ships,</HI> or <HI>Garrisons,</HI> sometimes ex∣pos'd to <HI>great Heats, Colds, Rains,</HI> to <HI>Hard fare, Hard lodging, Hard marches,</HI> (they're often ob∣lig'd to <HI>endure hardness</HI>) by which their <HI>Health is endangered.</HI> And, it's GOD alone that can <HI>preserve</HI> their <HI>endangered Health.</HI> He's the <HI>Healer</HI> of His People, the <HI>Health of their Countenance,</HI> (Exod. 15.26. Psal. 42.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.) it's His Preroga∣tive to make sore and to bind up, to <HI>wound and heal, to kill and make alive, and none can deliver out of his hand,</HI> Deut. 32.39.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT's GOD alone can give <HI>Courage</HI> to act properly in <HI>Military Affairs.</HI> A <HI>Cowardly</HI> Souldier is but a poor tool indeed, likely to do more hurt than good; more likely to discourage his Partners and Fellow-Souldiers, than to de∣stroy enemies, <HI>Deut.</HI> 20.8. Good courage and resolution is necessary to constitute a good Souldier; and none but GOD can give such cou∣rage. All hearts are in GOD's hand, He's <HI>the GOD of the Spirits of all flesh</HI>; He can so dis∣pirit and discourage Men, that they shall <HI>fear where no fear is,</HI> and the <HI>sound of a shaken leaf
<PB N="11" REF="002400_0013_0FDB3A7D05768770"/>
shall chase them,</HI> Lev. 26.36. Small dangers, or appearances or suspicions of danger, shall fill 'em with <HI>Frights, Fears, Terrors.</HI> On the other hand, GOD can Incourage and Spirit Persons to undertake <HI>great things,</HI> thô they're very hazar∣dous. Prov. 28.1. <HI>The righteous is bold as a Lion.</HI> Psal. 60.12. <HI>Through God we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.</HI> GOD can fill Persons with such boldness and <HI>courage,</HI> as that <HI>Five shall chase an hundred,</HI> (Lev. 26.8.) Yea, <HI>One shall chase a thousand,</HI> Josh. 23.10. When King <HI>Saul</HI> heard how the <HI>Ammonites</HI> Insulted those of <HI>Jabish Gilead,</HI> it's said, <HI>The Spirit of the Lord came upon him</HI>; and then he took speedy <HI>couragious</HI> methods to re∣lieve his Insulted, threatened Subjects, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11.6. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thrô <HI>Faith</HI> some have <HI>subdued King∣doms, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the Armies of the Aliens,</HI> Heb. 11.33, 34. The live∣ly exercise of Faith in GOD, fills the Soul with holy courage. <HI>The Lord is my light and my sal∣vation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? — Tho' an host should encamp against me, mine heart shall not fear,</HI> &amp;c. Psal. 27.1, 3. Lively <HI>Faith</HI> works great <HI>courage</HI>; and whence comes this <HI>Faith</HI>? Why it is the <HI>gift of GOD,</HI> Eph. 2.8.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT's GOD alone can <HI>Protect</HI> Persons, and <HI>Preserve their Lives in Battle.</HI> Every <HI>Ar∣row</HI> &amp; <HI>Bullet</HI> that's <HI>Shot,</HI> is govern'd by the same Providence, that directed the <HI>Syrian Arrow</HI> be∣tween <HI>the Joints of Ahab's harness to kill him,</HI> 1 King. 22.34. Whoever the Souldier <HI>levels</HI> at
<PB N="12" REF="002400_0014_0FDB3A7F92A3BA80"/>
when he <HI>Shoots,</HI> yet the <HI>Bullet</HI> hits the <HI>Mark</HI> that <HI>Providence aims at,</HI> and none other. Every <HI>Bul∣let</HI> that flies, thô seemingly at random, is as much under the Government of Providence, as the <HI>Sea</HI> to which GOD says; Job 38.11. <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come but no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.</HI> GOD alone can protect in times of danger, Men can't defend themselves. GOD is a <HI>shield,</HI> Psal. 84.11. A <HI>shield</HI> was a <HI>de∣fensive</HI> piece of Armour, to secure Persons against destructive blows, from <HI>Swords, Spears,</HI> &amp;c. Well, with reference to the Warlike dangers, the I sal∣mist call'd GOD, his <HI>Buckler, Deliverer, Shield, Fortress, High Tower,</HI> &amp;c. Psal. 18.2. and 144.2. Yea, he said, Psal. 140.7. <HI>O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of Battle.</HI> He might have had his <HI>head broke,</HI> nay, <HI>cut off</HI> in Battle, if GOD had not <HI>cover'd</HI> and defended it. Thô some <HI>trust in Cha∣riots and some in Horses,</HI> yet we should <HI>remember the name of the Lord our God,</HI> (Psal. 20.7.) for none else but He can preserve us in danger. Thô the <HI>Horse be prepared against the day of Bat∣tle</HI>; yet <HI>safety is of the Lord,</HI> Prov. 21.31. Men may <HI>fight,</HI> none but GOD can defend and <HI>protect.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. IT's GOD alone can give <HI>Success</HI> in War. As, <HI>whoever Plants or Waters,</HI> yet GOD alone gives the <HI>Increase,</HI> (1 Cor. 3.6, 7.) So, whoever <HI>Wars,</HI> and <HI>Fights,</HI> yet GOD alone can give <HI>Suc∣cess.</HI> The likeliest means often fail. The <HI>race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,</HI> Eccl. 9.11. <HI>Weapons</HI> are held in the hands
<PB N="13" REF="002400_0015_0FDB3A80CF306998"/>
of Men, <HI>Victory</HI> is held in GOD's hand, He gives it to whom He will. 1 Sam. 17.47. <HI>The Battle is the Lord's.</HI> 2 Chron. 20.15. <HI>The Battle is not yours but GOD's. The Lord is mighty in Battle,</HI> (Psal 24.8.) Therefore <HI>it's nothing with him to help, whether with many or with them that have no power,</HI> 2 Chron. 14.11. <HI>The Army of the Syrians came with a small company of Men, and the Lord delivered a very great Host into their hand,</HI> 2 Chron. 24.24. GOD can cause even <HI>wounded Men,</HI> to <HI>arise</HI> and <HI>burn a City,</HI> Jer. 37.10. <HI>Gideon's three hundred Men,</HI> with their <HI>Pit∣chers, Lamps, Trumpets</HI>; did fright, rout, and vanquish a vast Army of the <HI>Midianites,</HI> Judg. ch. 7. <HI>Jonathan</HI> and his <HI>Armour-Bearer,</HI> routed and vanquished the <HI>Army of the Philistines</HI>; at least they two <HI>began</HI> the matter, 1 Sam. 14. ch. If an Army is never so <HI>numerous, skilfull, coura∣gious,</HI> never so well <HI>provided with all warlike-stores</HI>; yet they can't command <HI>Success.</HI> All events of <HI>Battles</HI> and <HI>Wars</HI> are Intirely at GOD's dispose; and He often orders them quite contra∣ry to the expectation of Men, possibly of most Men.</P>
<P N="6">6. IF Men die in Battle, none but GOD can <HI>save their Souls.</HI> The Soul is more worth than a World. <HI>Men can kill the body, are not able to kill the Soul; but GOD can destroy both soul and body in hell,</HI> Mat. 10.28. So, GOD can <HI>Save the Soul</HI> too, can pardon it's Sins (and will do so, if it penitently believes in CHRIST) and take it safe to Heaven when it parts from the body. <HI>Good Men</HI> may <HI>die in War,</HI> by the hands of ene∣mies; godly King <HI>Josiah</HI> did so. But if the god∣ly
<PB N="14" REF="002400_0016_0FDB3A82533F5A58"/>
should die in Battle, in the High Places of the Field, yet their Souls go as safe to Heaven, as if, they'd di'd quietly in their Beds surrounded with attending, mourning Friends. <HI>Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, they rest from their la∣bours, their works follow them,</HI> Rev. 14.12. Their <HI>Death is their gain,</HI> they go to <HI>be with Christ which is far better,</HI> Phil, 1.21, 23.</P>
<P>NOW since all these things are so, surely it becomes those who go forth to War, to keep them∣selves from every wicked thing. If they have any thoughtful serious regard to their own <HI>Perso∣nal</HI> safety, honour, usefulness, they should be most careful to avoid every thing which might dis∣please or provoke GOD, <HI>in whose hand is their breath, and whose are all their ways</HI>; and who a∣lone can <HI>save or destroy.</HI> Nay, if they have any regard to the <HI>Welfare</HI> of those they <HI>fight for,</HI> they should be careful to keep themselves from every wicked thing. If those who go forth to War, should <HI>die in Battle,</HI> or be greatly <HI>blasted</HI> or <HI>de∣feated</HI>; this might be greatly and variously hurt∣full to the People they are a part of. They should not Indulge themselves in any wickedness, lest GOD blast them, and therein blast those they represent, or act for. For thô GOD sometimes prospers and succeeds wicked Men in Fight∣ing against Enemies; yet such wicked Men have no ground to <HI>expect Success.</HI> When <HI>Amaziah</HI> King of <HI>Judah</HI> was going to War against the <HI>E∣domites,</HI> he hired an <HI>hundred thousand</HI> Auxilia∣ries, even that number of the Men of <HI>Israel</HI>; but a Prophet of GOD said to him, 2 Chron. 25.7.
<PB N="15" REF="002400_0017_0FDB3A85AD4088A0"/>
<HI>O King, let not the Army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, to wit, with all the Children of Ephraim.</HI> As if the Prophet had said, Don't employ 'em, don't let 'em go with you, because GOD is not with them. Having greatly dishonour'd and provok'd GOD, in wor∣shipping the Idols <HI>Jeroboam</HI> had set up (as well as by other wicked practices) GOD would not so honour 'em in His Providence, as to use them as Instruments to obtain Victories for Judah. GOD sometimes prospers business the letter, for the sake of <HI>Pious Instruments</HI> imploy'd; con∣sider <HI>Jacob</HI> in managing <HI>Laban</HI>'s Affairs; and <HI>Joseph,</HI> in managing the Affairs of his Master in Aegypt.</P>
<P>WELL, as these words, <HI>keep thee</HI> from every wicked thing, may refer to the <HI>Souldiers that go forth to War</HI>; so they may refer,</P>
<P N="2">2. TO the <HI>rest of the People,</HI> even those who <HI>stay at Home.</HI> Doth our <HI>Host go forth,</HI> our armed Men to Fight against our Enemies? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we who stay at Home, should keep our selves from every wicked thing. We should be very studious and careful to do so, not only for the <HI>Glory of God</HI> (which we should <HI>supreamly a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m at,</HI> in all things, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31.) but subordinately also,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>FOR the sake of those who go forth to War.</HI> We've heard already, that the whole of their safe∣ty, welfare, usefulness depends entirely on GOD's Blessing, His favourable Presence, Protection, As∣sistance. Well, Let us not by <HI>our Sins</HI> provoke
<PB N="16" REF="002400_0018_0FDB3A8841BC07E0"/>
GOD to <HI>blast</HI> or frown upon, <HI>our Souldiers</HI> that go forth to Fight for us. They are <HI>part of our selves,</HI> are of the same <HI>body politick</HI> with us, are our <HI>Brethren,; our Bone</HI> and <HI>our Flesh</HI>; and they expose themselves to safeguard us, hazard their own Lives to preserve ours. Justice and Grati∣tude requires, that we should desire and seek their Welfare; therefore we should not by our Sins provoke GOD to bring evil upon them. For the Sins of a professing People, GOD often brings a blast on those they send forth to War. Why did GOD deliver a <HI>very great Host of the Jews,</HI> into the hands of a <HI>small Company of Syrian</HI> enemies? Why, 'twas because the <HI>Jews had for∣saken the Lord God of their Fathers,</HI> 2 Chron. 24.24. For the Sins of GOD's Professing Peo∣ple, he threatened, <HI>That the Bows of their Enemies should dash their young men to pieces,</HI> Isa. 13.18. So, Jer. 11.22. <HI>Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, behold I will punish you; the young men shall die by the sword.</HI> Let us take heed therefore, that we don't by our Sins provoke GOD to <HI>defeat our Souldiers,</HI> or give them up to the rage and <HI>will of our enemies.</HI> If we indulge our selves in a <HI>Careless, Prayerless, Irreligious Life,</HI> in <HI>pro∣fane Cursing and Swearing,</HI> in the <HI>abominable, Sin if Drunkenness</HI> (which is grown shamefully common) in <HI>Lying, Stealing, fraudulent unrigh∣teous Dealing, Malice, Envy,</HI> &amp;c. I say, if we indulge our selves in these, or any other known wicked Practices; what is this but a Fighting a∣gainst GOD by our Sins, and so a provoking Him to blast and disappoint (if not to destroy) our Souldiers gone forth to Fight for us? We're
<PB N="17" REF="002400_0019_0FDB12926BDAAF40"/>
unjust, perfideous, barbarous to those gone forth to Fight for us; if we thus expose and hazard their welfare by our own wickedness. They are hazarding their Lives for our welfare, let us not requite 'em evil for good; let us not add to their danger, by adding to the number and weight of our own Iniquities. We should not by our Sins provoke GOD to blast our Souldiers; but by earnest Prayers, and an humble close walking with GOD, we should do what we can that He may be a <HI>Shield</HI> and <HI>Buckler, Safety</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> to them. As we should keep our selves from e∣very wicked thing, <HI>for the sake of those who go forth to War</HI>; So we should,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>FOR our own Sakes, or for the sake of this People in general.</HI> Are not our Souldiers gone forth for us, for our good, to defend the Lives and Estates of this People; and to Indeavour the destroying those who would destroy us? Are not our Souldiers <HI>thus gone forth</HI>? And would we have them prosper &amp; be succeeded for our well∣fare? Then let us not by our Sins provoke that GOD, who alone can blast or prosper all our un∣dertakings. Let us so live, so act as to please (and obtain the smiles of) that GOD, who does <HI>according to his pleasure in Heaven, Earth, Sea and in all deep places,</HI> Psal. 135.6. Let us <HI>abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, let us live soberly, righteously, godlily in this present world,</HI> Tit. 2.12. This in general is the <HI>best me∣thod</HI> we can take, to have our <HI>Armes successful and prosperous.</HI> GOD said to <HI>Joshua,</HI> Josh. 1.7.
<PB N="18" REF="002400_0020_0FDB3A89C90B1FE0"/>
<HI>Only be thou strong and very couragious, that thou mayst observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst prosper whithersoever thou goest.</HI> Let us obey GOD's Laws, if we would prosper in our ways, Deut. 29.9. <HI>Keep therefore the words of this Covenant and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</HI> 2 Chron. 24.20. <HI>Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper? Because ye have forsaken the Lord, He also hath forsaken you.</HI> When we Sin against GOD, we <HI>wrong our own Souls,</HI> lay our selves open to His revenges, and walk in the way lead∣ing to shame and confusion. For, whatever we think of it, yet 'tis true, <HI>That Righteousness exal∣teth a Nation, but Sin is a reproach to any People,</HI> Prov. 14.34. The usual method of GOD's deal∣ing with His People, is set forth. 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>The Lord is with you while ye be with him, if ye seek him he will be sound of you; but if you for∣sake him he will forsake you.</HI> Isai. 1.19, 20. <HI>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land, but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be de∣voured with the sword, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</HI> What, wont you believe what the LORD says? His <HI>Mouth</HI> declares (and He <HI>can∣not lie,</HI> it's <HI>impossible for him to lie,</HI> Tit. 1.2. Heb. 6.18.) that if we <HI>rebel</HI> against Him, we shall be devoured with the <HI>Sword,</HI> or some Judg∣ments or other (if we walk contrary to Him, He'll walk contrary to us, <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.27, 28.) For these things <HI>written aforetime, were written for our learning,</HI> Rom. 15.4. If <HI>our ways pleasd
<PB N="19" REF="002400_0021_0FDB3A8B46C55A48"/>
the Lord,</HI> we might expect that He would <HI>make our enemies to be at peace with us,</HI> (Prov. 16.7.) Or else <HI>subdue</HI> them before us, Psal. 81.13,—15. <HI>O that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways; I should soon have subdu∣ed their enemies, and turned mine hand against their adversaries. The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him, but their time should have endured for ever.</HI></P>
<P>IF we hearken to GOD's Voice, and walk in His ways, we may humbly expect that He'll Fight against and subdue our Enemies; but if we Fight against GOD by our Sins, we may expect that He'll raise up, multiply and strength∣en and assist Enemies against us. It's extreamly foolish and dangerous (as well as unjust and ungrateful) for a People to <HI>make War against Heaven by their wickedness</HI>; therein they pro∣voke One that is stronger than they, that can blast or destroy them when He will, and use and succeed what Instruments He pleaseth against them. Isai. 42.24. <HI>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the Robbers? did not the Lord, he against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his law. Jacob, Israel,</HI> even a professing People of GOD were given up to the oppressing power of <HI>Enemies, Spoilers, Robbers,</HI> because they were <HI>disobedient to GOD,</HI> and would not <HI>walk in his ways.</HI> The <HI>Assyrian</HI> enemies, what were they, but only Instruments where-with GOD punish'd His rebellious People? Isai. 10.5, 6. <HI>O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand
<PB N="20" REF="002400_0022_0FDB3A8B9E3E4B58"/>
is mine Indignation. I will send him against an hypocritical Nation, and against the People of my wrath will I give him a charge,</HI> (they were <HI>com∣mission'd</HI> by Heaven, as it were to this work) <HI>to take the spoil and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</HI> Our ene∣mies, the <HI>Indians</HI> at the Eastward how <HI>false, perfideous, treacherous, rebellious, barbarous, wick∣ed</HI> soever they are in themselves; yet we're to look on them as the <HI>Rod of GOD's anger, the staff of his Indignation.</HI> He may use what Rod He will, to chastise and correct us. If they're but a <HI>weak rod,</HI> yet they're in a <HI>strong Hand</HI> that can <HI>strike hard,</HI> can whip us and make us <HI>bleed</HI> terribly before He has done with us. It is GOD (and not only the <HI>Indian</HI> enemies) that is con∣tending with us, managing a controversy with us, <HI>bringing a sword to avenge the quarrel of his Covenant,</HI> (Lev. 26.25.) Wicked Instruments are but <HI>His Rod, His Sword.</HI> Psal. 17.13. <HI>The wicked which is thy Sword.</HI> Would we therefore that GOD should <HI>put up his Sword,</HI> or <HI>throw his rod into the fire</HI>? Then the way we should take is, humbly and penitently to turn from all our Sins, trust in His Mercy thrô our LORD JESUS CHRIST for Reconciliation, and walk in His ways. It's not only our Indispensable <HI>Duty,</HI> but also our highest <HI>Wisdom, Prudence, Interest</HI> thus to do. All <HI>Politick Schemes,</HI> deep <HI>Projections</HI> warlike <HI>Stratagems,</HI> are but sorry trifles and bau∣bles compar'd to this <HI>most Wise Method.</HI> By a penitent turning to the <HI>Lord of Hosts, the God of Armies.</HI> Let us engage Him to be <HI>on our side</HI>; then He'll be <HI>our refuge, strength, a very
<PB N="21" REF="002400_0023_0FDB1290EA92B268"/>
present help in trouble</HI>; we need <HI>not fear tho' the earth were removed, and the mountains carried into the midst of the Seas; He can make Wars to cease, break the Bow, cut the Spear in sunder, and burn the Chariots in fire,</HI> Psal. 46. Let us In∣gage GOD on our side, and then He'll <HI>command deliverances for us,</HI> and help us to <HI>push and tread down those that rise up against us,</HI> Psal. 44.4, 5. If GOD be for us, on our side, then <HI>we may boldly say, the Lord is mine helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me,</HI> Heb. 13.6.</P>
<P>SURE I am, now the Host is gone forth a∣gainst the enemy, we should <HI>keep our selves from every wicked thing.</HI> In stead of growing more <HI>loose</HI> and <HI>dissolute,</HI> more <HI>rude</HI> and <HI>vicious,</HI> (as People are very prone to do in <HI>Time of War</HI>) we should seriously study and strive after a <HI>tho∣rough</HI> REFORMATION.</P>
<P>THOSE in <HI>Civil Authority</HI> should do so, in being <HI>Personally Exemplary</HI> and Conspicuous in the exercise of every Grace, and practice of every Duty; in being a <HI>Terror to evil doers and a praise to them that do well.</HI></P>
<P>MINISTERS <HI>of the Gospel</HI> also should do their utmost to promote a REFORMATION, in being <HI>harmless, blameless, unrebukable</HI> in their <HI>Conversation,</HI> studious and faithful in <HI>rightly di∣viding the word of truth,</HI> and <HI>dispensing the mysteries of God.</HI> Isai. 58.1. <HI>Cry aloud, spare
<PB N="22" REF="002400_0024_0FDB3A908917A300"/>
not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their Sins.</HI> They should plainly and faithfully tell People of their <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>; and warn them to <HI>turn &amp; live.</HI> They should also be much in <HI>Prayer,</HI> for the welfare of GOD's People. Joel 2.19. <HI>Let the Priests, the Minicters of the Lord weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heri∣tage to reproach, that the Heathen should rule over them: therefore should they say among the people, where is their God</HI>?</P>
<P>YEA, <HI>All Persons</HI> in their <HI>various Capacities,</HI> should do what they can to promote a RE∣FORMATION. Jer. 25.5. <HI>Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings.</HI> REFORMATION is what GOD loudly calls for at our hands.</P>
<P>WE are lately entred into a <HI>New War,</HI> we know the <HI>beginning</HI> but dont know the <HI>end</HI> of it. We are a <HI>professing</HI> but a very <HI>degenerate</HI> People, GOD is angry with us. The last Year He sore∣ly Scourg'd us by Sickness, the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; it greatly hindred <HI>Trade and Business, lessen'd</HI> our <HI>Estates, thind our Numbers,</HI> by an awful Mor∣tality, thô He <HI>punish'd us less than our Iniquities deservd.</HI> This <HI>Contagious Sickness</HI> was the <HI>Rod of GOD,</HI> He whip'd us with it, and <HI>whip'd many</HI> (probably above a <HI>Thousand</HI>) of this Peo∣ple to Death by it. This was a very sore Judg∣ment of GOD, yet we're not at all Reform'd
<PB N="23" REF="002400_0025_0FDB3A9203AE8528"/>
by it; and He is now contending with us in <HI>other ways.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sore and awful <HI>Drought</HI> Con∣siderably preva<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in many Places of the Land; Men and Beasts meet with difficulties under <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his frown of Providence. This Year also we have been considerably molested and spoiled, by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irates</HI> on the <HI>Sea</HI>; and by <HI>Indians</HI> on the Land, and a <HI>War is now opened.</HI> And what the LORD <HI>will do</HI> with us, we dont know; what He calls for at our hands, we do know, <HI>viz.</HI> that in Ezek. 18.30.— <HI>Repent and Turn your selves from all your transgressions, so Iniquity shall not be your ruin.</HI> The LORD is shaking His <HI>Rod▪</HI> brandishing His <HI>Sword</HI> over us, and what's our business now? Why see, Mic. 6.9. <HI>The Lord's voice crieth unto the City, and the man of wis∣dom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</HI> Our duty is that in Lam. 3.40. <HI>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.</HI> If we do thus, then <HI>He that hath torn, will heal us; He that hath smitten, will bind us up,</HI> Hos. 6.1.</P>
<P>As to the War we're ingag'd in, I would say,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>LET us not trust in Means.</HI> We should <HI>use</HI> the best means and methods we can; but <HI>not trust</HI> in any of them. Jer. 9.23. <HI>Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might.</HI> Very weighty was that saying of King <HI>Ahab,</HI> 1 King 20.11. <HI>Let not him that girdeth on his Harness, boast himself, as he that putteth it
<PB N="24" REF="002400_0026_0FDB3A948513C630"/>
off.</HI> Let us not depend too much on <HI>Probabili∣ties.</HI> Possibly some will think, our enemies are <HI>few</HI> in Number, small in <HI>Power,</HI> have no <HI>Maga∣zines,</HI> no <HI>defenced Cities</HI> to betake themselves to if routed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But, let us not flatter our selves with such thoughts, how mean and contemptible soever the enemy may be thought to be; yet they may possibly <HI>make all our hearts ake,</HI> before we've done with them. We know not how far GOD may Imploy them, to <HI>spill the Blood</HI> of this People. If the enemies are look'd on as <HI>few</HI> and <HI>weak,</HI> yet our <HI>Sins are so many and mighty</HI>; as should keep us from being <HI>vain∣glorious,</HI> from promising our selves speedy and great success. Thô we should be thankful for the success that we've had already, yet we should not be self-confident. Psal 44.6. <HI>I will not trust in my Bow, neither shall my Sword save me.</HI> It's very provoking to GOD and dangerous for us, to trust in means. Jer. 17.5. <HI>Thus saith the LORD, cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.</HI> We should be <HI>couragi∣ous</HI> to use means, but not so <HI>foolish</HI> as to trust in them. We should follow the counsel given by that great <HI>General, Joab,</HI> Just as he was going to ingage in Battle; even counsel becoming a <HI>Souldier</HI> and a <HI>Saint,</HI> (thô he was not much of the latter) 2 Sam. 10.12. <HI>Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our People and for the cities of our God; and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="25" REF="002400_0027_0FDB3A95B66FB6F8"/>2. <HI>WE should be much in Prayer to GOD, for help and success in War.</HI> Psal. 108.12. <HI>Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man.</HI> In King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Prayer at the Dedication of the Temple, it's plainly Intimated, That when the People are ingaged in <HI>War,</HI> they should be <HI>very Prayerful to GOD for help,</HI> 1 King. 8.44. The <HI>Israelites</HI> East of Jordan, were help'd in Battle against their enemies, yea, their enemies were delivered into their hands; <HI>for they cried unto GOD in the Battle, and he was Intreated of them because they trusted him,</HI> 1 Chron. 5.18,— 20. GOD never fails those, who sincerely Pray to Him and Trust in Him. Let us there∣fore be humble, earnest, constant in Prayer to GOD, for Protection and Success to our Souldi∣ers, as well as for all Blessings needful for this People. Psal. 122.6. <HI>Pray for the peace of Je∣rusalem, they shall prosper that love thee.</HI> GOD says, Psal. 50.15. <HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me.</HI> Phil. 4.6. <HI>Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by Prayer and Supplication with Thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to GOD.</HI></P>
