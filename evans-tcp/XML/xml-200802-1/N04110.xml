<BIBL>PSALM CXLVII. 2.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The LORD doth Build up</HI> Jerusalem,</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS every house is builded by some man; so he that built all things is God. The Heavens and the Earth, the upper &amp; lower Sto∣ries of the vast and stupendous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rame and goodly Structure of the Universe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> glorious piece of divine Architecture: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o are all the Hosts of them; the Angels of Light, those morning Stars, those first-born and eldest Sons of time, those bright Intelli∣gences of the superior World; Thousands and Ten Thousand times Ten Thousands of whom People the Empyrean Heavens, inhabiting those blissful Abodes where they do always behold the face of their Father which is in Heaven; and are continually feasled with the Joys of Beatisick Vision: Together with Man∣kind, who dwell in houses of Clay, whose foundation is in the Dust: And all the other vari∣ous Kinds and Species, Ranks and Orders of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nferior Creatures, whether Animate or In∣animate, belonging to this visible Creation

He whose Name alone is Jehovah, who was be∣fore &amp; is above all Worlds, a Being Super-in∣tellectual, Self-existent, Independant, Self-suffi∣cient &amp; alsufficient; this alwise Artificer by his mighty Fiat, call'd up &amp; caus'd this stately Fa∣brick to start forth out of nothing: That high vaulted Roof, that spacious &amp; glittering Canopy spread over our heads (imbellish'd &amp; bespan∣gled with numerous bright Luminaries; the Sky which is strong and as a molten Looking∣glass, enamel'd, bedeck'd &amp; emboss'd with in∣numerable worlds of Light, of various Mag∣nitudes Immensity more orient &amp; glistering than the most sparkling Diamond or Pearl, than the Gold of <HI>Ophir,</HI> the precious Onyx or the Sapphire) this is the work of his Fingers; the wondrous Work of Him which is perfect in Knowlege. 'Tis he who by his Wisdom hath thus garnished the Heavens, who hath there pitched a Tabernacle for the Sun, and ap∣pointed the Ordinances of Heaven; who hath made and guides Arcturus with his sons Orion and Plei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des and the Chambers of the South, those influential &amp; useful Constellations.</P>
<P>Tis the same alwise &amp; alpowerful Being who hath also laid the beams of his chambers in the Waters, and fix'd the Groundfills &amp; Foun∣dations of this Earth, or rather hangeth the same upon nothing: For his huge, ponderous te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous Globe has no Atlas to support it
<PB N="3" REF="005066_0005_1016B638E690F0A8"/>
No, there's nothing underneath save everlast∣ing Arms; an incontestible proof of a Divine Being, an eternal Power and Godhead, Job 26.7. <HI>He stretcheth out the North over the empty place, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Terra pilae similis nullo fulcimine nixa, aere sublato, tam grave pendet onus.</HI></P>
<P>How wonderful! to see an Orb of such vast Bulk, hang equally poiz'd with its own weight and swimming about in the liquid AEther. <HI>Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thy hands, Psal.</HI> 102.25. The Earth (no less than the Heavens) with all its Appurtenances; its useful Atmost∣phere and all its beautiful Apparatus and rich Furniture; the winged Choristers which sing among the Branches, and what time they life up themselves on high scorn the House and his Rider; every Beast of the Forrest and the Cattle upon a thousand Hills; the Finny Na∣tions and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the Seas, these all loudly proclaim the Wisdom, the Power and the Goodness of their Munificent Creator. <HI>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the Earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide Sea,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Psal.</HI> 104.24, 25.</P>
<P>And as all things were made by him, so by him all things consist: His Omnipotent Ma∣nutenency

upholds and keeps them from re∣lapsing into their primordial Abyss of Non∣entity, their original Nothing. As <HI>He spake and it was done,</HI> so <HI>be commanded and it stood fast. For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in Heaven,</HI> in or among the heavenly Bodies, which by virtue of that Word of God's Power by which they were made, do constantly continue the same in their Substance and Order and Courses, which, by virtue of the fix'd and establish'd Laws whereby they are govern'd, are conti∣nually fulfilling their Annual and Diurnal Re∣volutions, and shedding down their benign Influences of Light &amp; Heat upon this Earth: And it follows, <HI>Thou hast establish'd the Earth &amp; it abideth: They,</HI> viz the Heavens &amp; the Earth <HI>continue this day according to thine Ordinances, Psal.</HI> 119.89, 91.</P>
<P>As for Mankind they are his peculiar Work∣manship: His hands have made &amp; fashioned them, and that in wondrous wise; the Inspi∣ration of the Almighty hath given them Un∣derstanding, whereby they are capable of supe∣rior pleasure &amp; felicity in the Contemplation of, and an Assimulation to, and Communion with the Ever-being and Ever-blessed Jeho∣vah, in whose presence there is fulness of Joy; and the fruition of whom, and nothing else, yields consummate Beatitude to an intelligent Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005066_0007_1016B63C4C4A9758"/><HI>The Lord is good unto all,</HI> and leaves not him∣self <HI>without Witness</HI> among the Heathen, in that <HI>he gives them Rain and fruitful Seasons, filling their hearts with food &amp; gladness,</HI>—But his <HI>Divine Philantrophy,</HI> his Love &amp; good-will to his own dear chosen People (together with all the other Excellencies &amp; Perfections belonging to his thrice glorious Essence, which have time immemorial been Employ'd for their welfare and Happiness; particularly his amazing Con∣trivance and Transaction for their recovery from the ruins of their Apostasie) merits our special Notice and challenges our most devout Resentment and grateful Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>This is what the Psalmist takes special No∣tice of and summarily mentions in the Text, as an Argument whereby he would stir up himself &amp; others to celebrate the high Praises of God.</P>
<P>Who was the inspired Author and Penman of this Psalm is uncertain, whether David or some Prophet who liv'd after the Jews resto∣ration from the Babylonish Captivity and the Rebuilding of their City and Temple in Jeru∣salem: But undoubtedly the Text has a pri∣mary reference to that great, notable and wonderful Event. Hence the following words are,—<HI>He gathereth together the Outcasts of Israel.</HI> And yet it may be consider'd not only as a brief and bright Meditation and compendious
<PB N="6" REF="005066_0008_1016B5D41E8B9868"/>
Narration of what God had done and was then doing; but likewise as a Prophetick indigita∣tion of what God has ever since been, is still doing, and will do in behalt of his Church &amp; chosen People even to the end of the World. For Jerusalem not only in David and Solo∣mon's days and during the time that the first Temple was standing, but after the Rebuild∣ing of it, was the chosen Place of the stated and solemn Worship of the true God: For the Lord had <HI>chosen Zion, he desired it for his habita∣tion</HI>; and <HI>loved the gates of</HI> that Mountain more than <HI>all the dwellings of Jacob.</HI> Thither King David had brought <HI>up the Ark of the Covenant</HI> and had there fix'd its <HI>resting Place</HI>; even in this City of David, in whose Palaces <HI>God was Known for a Refuge:</HI> The house of God was there, and thither the Tribes went up, <HI>the Tribes of the Lord unto the testimony of Israel,</HI> to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord. And there also were <HI>set Thrones of Judgement,</HI> the <HI>Thrones which appertain'd to the house of David.</HI> It was now the Sent of God's Publick Wor∣ship &amp; Ordinances, and so an eminent Type and Figure of his universal Church for ever∣more. It was <HI>a City that was compact together,</HI> and so a lively and lovely Emblem of the Churches Unity &amp; Happiness, and the flou∣rishing State of Religion in all after times; pointing us to that <HI>Jerusalem which is above,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="005066_0009_1016B63DEB6DE3B0"/>
or rather from above, <HI>is free and is the Mother of us all</HI>: By which is meant the Gospel Church, somtimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the heavenly Jerusalem,</HI> and <HI>the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of hea∣ven as a Bride adorned for her Husband.</HI>—As the Literal Jerusalem was a Type of the Spi∣ritual, so the Rebuilding of the former was a Type of the Reviving and Edification of the latter.</P>
<P>And if we run over the Annals of the Church and observe the several Periods wherein God has remembred it in, and rais'd it up from, its low Estate; we shall find that it bears no little Resemblance to Jerusalem in the fall and rise thereof, which our Text nextly refers to.</P>
<P>Now then, by the <HI>Lord's Building up Jerusa∣lem,</HI> we may understand in general, no only his Rearing up the Church of Israel and making them the Subjects of many peculiar and distin∣guishing Priviledges &amp; Immunities; Blessings both of a Spiritual and Temporal nature and reference, but likewise all that he has done, is now doing and may do hereafter in Building up the Christian Church; all that any way contributes to the furtherance of the Welfare and Happiness of his People in Gospel Days.</P>
<P>Here a large field of Discourse opens to our view; but I may not enter far into it, lest I exceed the narrow limits of Time allotred me. Would the time permit me, I might mention
<PB N="8" REF="005066_0010_1016B5E0764324D0"/>
<HI>the loving Kindnesses of the Lord</HI> and the <HI>great Goodness toward the house of Israel</HI> which he hath bestowed on them, <HI>according to his Mercies,</HI> and <HI>according to the multitude of his loving Kindnesses</HI>: And likewise the loving Kindnesses of the Lord according to all that <HI>the Lord hath be∣stowed on Us and Others</HI> of the Gentile Church through the several Periods and successive A∣ges thereof: As also those glorious things which are <HI>spoken concerning the City of God,</HI> in those Scripture Predictions and Promises which have not as yet had their plenary accomplish∣ment. For according to his promise, <HI>we are looking for new Heavens and a new Earth where∣in dwelleth Righteousness.</HI> We are waiting in hope and praying for <HI>the great Deliverer to come to Zion &amp; turn away Ungodliness from Jacob.</HI> We are wishing for the dawn of that happy day, when <HI>He who is the Light of the Gentiles,</HI> shall be likewise <HI>the Glory of his People Israel,</HI>—When the Lord shall bring back his ancient People from all the Lands whither his anger hath scattered them, and release them from their Bands of thick Darkness, <HI>whom Satan hath bound, lo, this</HI> Seventeen Hundred <HI>Years.</HI></P>
<P>The ancient method of Preaching in Old Testament times, consisted very much in an historical Narration or Recital of memorable Mercies relating to God's Church and People; See <HI>Psal.</HI> 78. 1—7. <HI>Holy men of God as they were

moved by the Holy Ghost,</HI> have taken in hand to <HI>set in order a Declaration of many remarkable things</HI> respecting the Birth, Infancy and Growth of the Church, both <HI>Jewish</HI> &amp; <HI>Christian.</HI> A most valuable Church History this! Than which there is none Extant more Instructive, Delight∣ful, Entertaining and Profitable; nor indeed is there any that is Equally so.</P>
<P>Here then let me briefly mention a few things relating to the Upbuilding,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Of the Jewish Church,</HI> more especially du∣ring the Fourteen Generations from Abraham to David. <HI>The God of glory appeared unto Abra∣ham when he was in Mesopotamia, and said unto him, Get thee out of thy Country and from thy Kin∣dred, &amp;c.</HI> And by Faith when he was so call'd <HI>to go out into a place which he,</HI> viz. in his Seed, <HI>should afterward receive for an Inheritance, be obey'd,</HI> and <HI>by faith sojourned in the land of Promise</HI>; and from him <HI>sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the Stars of the sky in mul∣titude, and as the Sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</HI> Abraham (thence called <HI>the Fa∣ther of the Faithful</HI>) was the first lively Stone that was laid in that spiritual Building. Isa. 51.1, 2. <HI>Look unto the Rock whence ye are hewn, &amp;c.</HI> i. e. <HI>Look unto Abraham your Father and unto Sa∣rah that bare you; for I called him alone &amp; blessed him and increased him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005066_0012_1016B5E263CEB7B0"/><HI>When Israel was a Child then</HI> the Lord <HI>loved him, and called his Son out of Egypt; he taught them also to go, taking them by their Arms: He led him about, He instructed him, He kept him as the apple of his Eye: The Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him. What mar∣vellous things did he in the sight of their Fathers in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan?</HI> And du∣ring their Forty Years Travel through the Wilderness of <HI>Sinai,</HI> how often did he appear <HI>Riding on the Heavens for their help,</HI> and in his <HI>Excellency upon the Skies?</HI> When Means failed and they could not help themselves; when they knew not what to do no which way to turn and could only <HI>stand still and see the Salva∣tion of God.</HI> Witness his <HI>dividing the Sea</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the Ransomed of the Lord to pass over</HI>: His raining down <HI>Manna upon them to Eat,</HI> giving of them <HI>the Corn of Heaven, so that Man did eat Angels food</HI>: His <HI>raining Flesh also upon them as Dust, and feathered Fowl like as the sand of the Sea,</HI> Moreover his <HI>cleaving the Rocks in the Wilderness,</HI> and giving them Drink <HI>as out of the great Depths,</HI> bringing <HI>Streams out of the flinty Rock,</HI> and cau∣sing Waters to <HI>run down thence like Rivers.</HI></P>
<P>In what an elegant and exalted Style strong and lively Metaphors, are the signal Favours of Heaven towards that People recognized and recorded in that Swan-like Song of <HI>Moses? Deut.</HI> 32 8, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>14, And so by the Prophet <HI>Ha∣bakkuk,
<PB N="11" REF="005066_0013_1016B646D45E5330"/>
Chap.</HI> 3. 3.—16. And elsewhere in the Sacred Pages. The Wisdom, Goodness, Justice, Holiness, Faithfulness and Power of God were Conspicuous &amp; eminently display'd in the Methods of his guiding, governing, pro∣tecting and building up his Church &amp; People at that Day; in setting up and establishing Religion among them, giving them his A∣doption, his Covenant, his Law and Promises; setting up his Tabernacle, giving them Or∣dinances &amp; Institutions, &amp; appointing Priests and Levites to teach Jacob his Law and Israel his Statutes, and administer those Ordinances according to that Mosaic Paedagogy. This is remark'd in our Context as a signal Instance of divine Favour and the distinguishing Mercy of God towards them, <HI>Ver.</HI> 19, <HI>&amp;</HI> 20. The Gospel was Preach'd to them <HI>at sundry times</HI> &amp; in <HI>divers manners</HI>; particularly in <HI>the brazen Serpent,</HI> and <HI>the Rock that folowed them, which Rock</HI> (the Apostle assures us) <HI>was Christ,</HI> 1 Cor. 10. 4. Moreover, in <HI>setting up Civil Government</HI> among them, sending <HI>Moses his Servant,</HI> as well as <HI>Aaron whom he had chosen.</HI> While they were &amp; remain'd under a Theocratical form of Go∣vernment, God himself as their great Legisla∣tor, delivered them all their Civil Statutes as well as Sacred Canons; all their Laws, Mo∣ral, Ceremonial, Judicial and Military; and raised up, qualified &amp; improved such as were
<PB N="12" REF="005066_0014_1016B5E9F45F8C08"/>
<HI>Utriusque tabulae Custodes,</HI> who were happily In∣strumental towards their Upbuilding both in Church and Commonwealth; towards secu∣ring to them whatsoever was Valuable per∣taining either to Religion or Property: Men famous and had in reputation for Wisdom, In∣tegrity, Ability &amp; Faithfulness; able Men and such as feared God, men of Truth and hating Covetousness; wise men and understanding &amp; known, <HI>i. e.</HI> approved among their Tribes. Such should all Civil Rulers be. <HI>See Numb.</HI> 11.16, 17, 25.</P>
<P>Thus God led them through the Wilder∣ness by the right hand of <HI>Moses &amp; Aaron,</HI> with his own glorious Arm, going before them; affording them all that Light and Direction which their darkness and difficulties, streights and perplexities called for; teaching them in the way which they should go, and guiding them with his Eye: Supporting them under and extricating them out of their distresses &amp; dangers. In the Mount of their difficulties he was seen, working deliverance &amp; salvation for them; and brought them at length to the border of his Sanctuary, even to the Mountain which his right Hand had purchased. He drave out the Heathen before them, made room for them and did plant them in the land flowing with Milk and Honey: for they got not the Land in possession by their own

Sword, neither did their own Bow save'em, but his right hand and his holy arm and the light of his Countenance, because he had a favour unto them.</P>
<P>Thus happy was Israel, so that no People was like unto them, a People saved by the Lord, <HI>the Shield of their Help,</HI> and who was <HI>the Sword of their Excellency</HI>; whose Wisdom, Power and Goodness were singularly Con∣cerned and Employed for them: And this notwithstanding their base and black ingrati∣tude, frowardness, multiplied Prevarications &amp; manifold Heaven-daring Rebellions against him.</P>
<P>And (to pretermit many things) how did the Lord appear in his glory, by <HI>the Building up of Zion?</HI> How did his Wonder-working Providence, even literally <HI>Build up Jerusalem,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>David and Solomon?</HI> And so after it had been Demolish'd, laid in Ashes and turn'd into a ruinous heap by the Chaldeans, that bloody and hasty Nation.</P>
<P>But I may not further Enlarge here, but must hasten,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To take Notice of some few things relating to the Lord's Building up his New Jerusalem the Gospel Church.</HI> God willing to shew his Wrath and make his Power known, endured with much Long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to Destruction; and that he might make known
<PB N="14" REF="005066_0016_1016B5EEDB303C50"/>
the riches of his Glory on the vessels of Mer∣cy which he had afore prepared unto glory, even Us whom he hath called under the New Testament dispensation, <HI>not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles.</HI> He now calls us <HI>His People which were not his People,</HI> and us <HI>Beloved which were not Beloved.</HI> In how surprizing a manner was the Arm of the Lord Revealed, during the Apostolick Age, when <HI>also to the Gentiles be granted Repentance unto Life</HI>; when Thousands were added to the Church, even <HI>such as should be Saved,</HI> and that in one Day, and by the preaching of one Sermon? when in great Numbers and with great Speed they came flocking into the Christian Church, ful∣filling that which was spoken by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Chap. 66.8. when <HI>the Earth was made to bring forth in one Day,</HI> when <HI>a Nation was born at once.</HI> And Chap. 60.8. <HI>Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as Doves to their windows</HI>? How many golden Candlesticks were Erected, even <HI>where Satan's seat and synagogue had been</HI>; in those <HI>dark places of the Earth</HI> which had been <HI>full of the habitations of Cruelty</HI>? Thus was the glory of the Lord revealed, and all Flesh saw it together. And Gods way has ever since been &amp; is still in the Sanctuary. <HI>Who is so great a God as our God?</HI> But I must dismiss this tho't, &amp; pro∣ceed now to offer two or three brief hints, from whence it may further appear that the words
<PB N="15" REF="005066_0017_1016B6514442A708"/>
of our text are <HI>words fitly spoken, like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</HI> Words taken in their allusive &amp; metaphorical or figurative Sense, very signi∣ficant &amp; expressive of divers things relating to the Church of God respecting both the <HI>Esse</HI> &amp; the <HI>Bene Esse</HI> of it; which are to be attributed and ascribed to none but Him who <HI>worketh all things according to the Counsel of his own will.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Church is fitly flyl'd Jeru∣salem, appears in that,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>Jerusalem (which was built up as a City that is Compact together) was a lively Emblem or Picture of the Church's Unity and Peace.</HI> The Name signifies <HI>Peace:</HI> Which Name was given it after David took the Fort of <HI>Zion</HI> from the <HI>Jebusites.</HI> For before that it was called <HI>Jebus</HI>; a Noun of a quite contrary sig∣nification: Which being interpreted, is, <HI>The Fire of God.</HI> Agreeable to which mystical Name, the Inhabitants (who were a People <HI>hated &amp; accursed by God,</HI> against whom he had <HI>had indignation a long time,</HI> and that <HI>fire kindled in his anger burnt to the lowest Hell</HI>) perhaps were suffered (as a just Judgment of heaven upon them) to live in the fire of Contention, Variance &amp; Strife, in Malice and Envy, Hate∣ful and Hating one another.)</P>
<P>It was not now distinct and opposite, but united and uniform both in its Government
<PB N="16" REF="005066_0018_1016B5F307F1DBF8"/>
and Religion. In a resembling manner there is (at least there ought to be) Unity, Unifor∣mity, Peace and Harmony maintained &amp; cul∣tivated among Christians. <HI>That they all may be one,</HI> agreeable to our Saviour's Prayer, and to the inspired Apostle's description of the Church, <HI>Fpb</HI> 4.1,—6 <HI>&amp;</HI> 12,—16. Peace and Love and Unity is the great and distinguish∣ing Law and Character of the Christian Pro∣fession. A divided Church is (in a very ill sense) <HI>terrible as an Army with Banner</HI>; and as <HI>the Company of Two Armies,</HI> — Indeed the phrase (in strictness of speech) is a Solaecism, and a Contradiction in terms.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Jerusalem was a very pleasant &amp; beautiful City.</HI> Beautiful for Situation and for its good∣ly Buildings; particularly the Temple, which was the most magnifical, curious &amp; splendid Edifice that ever human Art contriv'd, Hands Erected or mortal Eyes beheld. On account of which, men call'd that City, <HI>the perfection of Beauty, the Joy of the whole Earth.</HI> In like manner, the Church is exceeding Beautiful; especially in the Eyes of him <HI>who seeth not as ruin seeth,</HI> but <HI>looketh on the heart.</HI> Psal. 45.13. <HI>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, her Cloathing</HI> also <HI>is of wrought Gold.</HI> Ezek. 16.13.— <HI>Thou wast exceeding beautiful: Thy beauty was perfect through my Comliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.</HI> See also <HI>Rev.</HI> 9.8,—

With what lively &amp; significant flowers of di∣vine Rhetorick does the heavenly Bridegroom set forth the excelling Beauties of his Spouse, the Church, in that <HI>Song of Songs which is Solo∣mon's? Thou art beautiful, O my Love as Tirza, comly as Jerusalem. Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thou hast ravish'd my heart, my sister, my spouse, with one of thine Eyes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Who is</HI> she <HI>that looketh forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, and clear as the Sun? How fair and how pleasant art thou, O Love, for Delights? Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple. Thy neck is as a tower of Ivory.

<P>Thus do all true Believers (who are the constituent parts of this Building of God, this Temple in which the Holy Ghost dwells) shine with a distinguishing Lustre, and reflect a Divine, God-like Beauty; insomuch that <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> yea even <HI>Solomon's Temple in all its glory was not adorn'd &amp; beautify'd like one of these.</HI></P>
<P>Tis true, the Visible Church (collectively taken) somtimes resembles one <HI>that has lain among the Pots</HI>; and may say as in Cart. 1. 5, 6. <HI>I am black as the tents of Kedar. Look not upon me, &amp;c.</HI> But then again there are times when

it resembles <HI>a dove whose wings are covered over with Silver, and her feathers with yellow Gold.</HI> The Daughter of Zion was cover'd with a dark Cloud, the beauty of Israel was greatly marr'd; her gold was become dim, her most fine gold was changed, when those miseries &amp; calamities spoken of in <HI>Daniel</HI> were brought upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> by the remainder of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire, and afterwards by the <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣pire, about the time of our Saviour's Nativity, especially at the time of the Destruction brought upon the City and Temple &amp; Nation by <HI>Titus.</HI></P>
<P>But yet when the <HI>bright and morning Star</HI> ap∣peared, and <HI>the Sun of Righteousness arose with healing in his wings,</HI> how beautiful and glorious did the Kingdom of the Messiah soon appear? Fulfilling what was spoken by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> when he beheld his glory and spake of him. Isa. 4.2. <HI>In that day shall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent amp; comly.</HI> And (blessed be God) we hope er'e long to see a more ample Fulfilment of these and such like glo∣rious Prophecies and Promises, Isa. 60.1, 3. <HI>A∣rise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightness of thy rising.</HI> Chap. 52.1. <HI>Awake, awake, put on strength, O Zion, put on thy beautiful garments, O

<P>The good Lord hasten the time when there shall be even upon the Bells of the Horses, <HI>Ho∣liness unto the Lord,</HI> and when every Pot in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and in <HI>Judah,</HI> shall be <HI>Holiness unto the Lord</HI>; when every common thing, such as Bells, and Bridles, and the Utensils of private Houses, Pots and Pitchers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall be dedi∣cated to God, <HI>i. e.</HI> used in his Service and as Instruments to his Glory.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>As the Mountains were round about Jeru∣salem, by which it was in some measure Screen'd both from stormy Winds and Tempests, and from the assaults of the Enemy</HI>: So the Lord is round about his People from henceforth even for ever. — <HI>We have a strong City, Salvation will God appoint for Walls &amp; Bulwarks,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.1-4.</P>
<P>But I must hasten,</P>

<P>And,</P>

3, 11. The Church is built on the Founda∣tion of the Apostles &amp; Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone. This is the Lord's doing and it is marvellous in our Eyes. Isa. 28.16. <HI>Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a Foundation, a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious Corner-stone, a sure Foun∣dation,</HI> &amp;c. As the Temple (that illustrious Type of the Christian Church) was founded on a Rock, <HI>viz.</HI> Mount-<HI>Moriah</HI>; so on this Rock of Ages the Church is built, whence it is that the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it. This Foundation of God standeth sure: Tis an everlasting Foundation. Hence the Superstructure, <HI>viz</HI> the Church Built thereon, is more stable, durable &amp; permanent, than all the Monuments, Statues and triumphal Ar∣ches Erected to perpetuate the Memory of Princes, than Mountains of Brass. than Pyra∣mids of Gold or Pillars of Marble, — Upon this living Stone has the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom which shall never be destroyed; a Kingdom spiritual &amp; heavenly in the Laws and Administration of it: Not bounded by any Limits, as worldly Empires are; but truly Universal, which is the true Catholick Church. And this lead me to say,</P>

Now its God alone who can <HI>of Stones raise up Children unto Abraham, i, e.</HI> Can quicken and make spiritually Alive such <HI>as are dead in tres∣passes and sins.</HI></P>
<P>Men (who before Conversion are like Stones or Timber in their native Roughness or Crookedness before they are hew'd &amp; squar'd) by Renewing grace become like <HI>Corner stones, polish'd after the similitude of a Palace</HI>; fit Mate∣rials to build withal an House for the Lord, a <HI>Habitation for the Mighty God of Jacob.</HI> Is the Church Edified? Are Sinners Converted? Are Saints built up in spiritual Knowlege, Faith, Holiness and divine Comfort? This is all owing to the Convincing, Enlightning, Humbling, Regenerating, Sanctifying In∣fluences of the Holy Spirit of Grace, Light &amp; Truth. — Which brings me to say,</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>The Means and lnstruments made use of &amp; improved in carrying on this Work, are all under the Divine Management, Direction and Influence</HI>; are actuated, guided, govern'd and rendred Effi∣cacious and Successful by a Virtue and Power derived from him.</P>

And hence Conversion (which is a Moral and not a Phy∣sical Change wrought in the Soul) is called a <HI>turning of it from darkness to light.</HI> Which is done by God's shining into our hearts, and giving of us the light of the Knowlege of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. If in Judgment to a person or people, the influences of the Spirit are deny'd, the dews of divine Grace suspended and withheld, they prove like the barren Earth <HI>which drinketh in the Rain that falls ost upon it,</HI> and yet <HI>bringeth forth nothing but Briars and Thorns,</HI> is <HI>nigh unto Cursing, whose End is to be burned.</HI> The long continued Un∣fruitfulness

<P>And as true it is,</P>
<P N="3">[3] <HI>That except the Lord keep this City, the Watchmen</HI> (the Civil Ruler I mean) <HI>waketh but in vain.</HI> Civil Government is a choice and valuable Blessing, of very high Importance to the Weal of a Republick.

Hence they are styl'd, <HI>Gods, Nursing∣fathers, Benefactors, Shields of the Earth, Strong Rods, Pillars, Corner-stones, &amp;c.</HI> This denotes and plainly intimates the necessity of them and their great usefulness, — Even as the whole Building depends upon the Pillars or Corner∣stones, which bear it up, — They are in many respects their Peoples <HI>Decus ac Tutamen,</HI> both their Glory and their Defence; their Instru∣mental Saviour's, their Tutelar and Guardian Angels, as the Breath of their Nostrils, as the Light of the Morning when the Sun riseth,
<PB N="27" REF="005066_0029_1016B6629E01F220"/>
even a Morning without Clouds: They come down like Rain upon the mowen Grass, like Showers that water the Earth; and are as needful and as useful in their place, as those comprehensive and extensive Blessings, the <HI>Sun and the Rain.</HI> They are as <HI>an Hiding place from the Wind,</HI> and <HI>a Covert from the Tempest</HI>; as <HI>Rivers of Waters in a Dry place,</HI> as the <HI>Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</HI> See all this Exemplify'd in <HI>Job,</HI> when he sat Chief, and dwelt as a King in the Army; as one that comforteth the Mourners: Job 29 11,—17. <HI>When the Ear heard me then it blessed me; and when the Eye saw me, it gave witness to me.

<P>Moreover, God is to be seen in Raising up, Qualifying and Improving, Counselling and Assisting, Prospering and Succeeding those whom he advances to Place, Power &amp; Dignity above others. <HI>Promotion cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South; but God is the Judge, He putteth down one, and setteth up another.

<P N="3">III. <HI>Our Subject suggest Divine Counsel to all Orders and Degrees of men in a Publick Station and Capacity, by which to Regulate their Conduct.</HI> Since the <HI>Great &amp; Wise Master-Builder</HI> sees fit to carry on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the <HI>Instrumentality</HI> of those whom he delights <HI>thus to Honour,</HI> it must needs be their bounden Duty, as <HI>Co∣workers together with God</HI> to Exert themselves in a God-like manner, in furthering &amp; pushing forward the same.

Religious Interest &amp; Enjoyments of this Peo∣ple: Many of whose <HI>Names</HI> (we trust) <HI>are writ∣ten in Heaven,</HI> and Recorded <HI>in the Lamb's Book of Life.</HI> An Interest this, which must needs be dear to him, <HI>Your Mothers Children</HI> do make You <HI>the Keepers of the Vineyard,</HI> and under God confide in You; trusting you will yet <HI>Rule with God,</HI> and be <HI>Faithful with the Saints.</HI> And God has graciously promised that <HI>He will be with the good</HI>; viz. <HI>the good Ruler.</HI> He will be with you, in all your faithful, wise &amp; just Administrations; and will not <HI>wipe out your good Deeds,</HI> but <HI>remem∣ber you for good according to all that you have done,</HI> or may do, <HI>in building up</HI> this <HI>his Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>What Qualifications are requisite for, and what particular Duties are incumbent on Civil Rulers, as such, have from time to time been suggested to You by such as were much more Capable of it than I am: But of all that has or indeed can be said, this is the comprehensive Sum, viz, <HI>That You Employ all your Powers and Abilities, and make use of all your Wisdom and Authority and do all you can towards Building up Jerusalem.</HI> This is the Epitome of all that God requires or that we your People can rea∣sonably expect from You. And as touching what there is or may be for You to do in this great Affair, I hope I may say to each one of You, as <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 King. 2.9. <HI>Thou art a wise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and knowest what thou oughtest to do.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="005066_0042_1016B6241F91BDC8"/>I presume, I may in the Name of the most, if not all, the pious thinking &amp; well-affected a∣mong us (without flattery) go into the Lan∣guage of <HI>Tertullus</HI> the Orator &amp; say, <HI>Seeing that by You we enjoy great Quietness; and that very worthy Deeds are done to this People, by your Provi∣dence, we accept it always &amp; in all places</HI> (most noble Rulers) <HI>with all Thankfulness.</HI> So that when in the Name of Your People I humbly address my self to You, and say as they to Ezra,— <HI>This matter belongeth to You, arise and do it</HI>: I trust I may add, <HI>We also will be with you.</HI> We the Lord's Ministers, and we the People of the Lord. And, Oh! that more of the Spirit that came upon <HI>Amasai</HI> might rest upon us all, 1 Chron. 12.18. <HI>Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: Peace, peace be unto thee, and Peace be unto thy Helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.</HI></P>
<P>When it pleased the Supream, Alwise and Sovereign Ruler of the World (in whose right Hand are all our Changes) to call up our MOSES, our late Honourable Governour in Chief <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Honourable <HI>JOSEPH TALCOTT</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR></NOTE>, when full of Days and full of the Holy Ghost; (as it were) to the Mountain of <HI>Nebo,</HI> to the top of <HI>Pisgah,</HI> to die there; who after he had long faithfully Served his Generation, by the Will of God fell on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and his Sepul∣chre is here with us: Whose Death was gene∣rally

Regretted, &amp; deservedly Lamented, whose Memory is still dear to us, and will be <HI>had in Everlasting Remembrance</HI>: And when Provi∣dence so ordered and dispos'd. that by that time we had Mourned for him <HI>our Moses,</HI> Thirty Days, and even before the days of Weeping &amp; Mourning for him were ended; our JOSHUA on whom <HI>Moses</HI> had laid his Hands; one full of the Sprit of Wisdom, was Chosen to Succeed and fill up that Vacancy. This was (as I take it) to the great Satisfaction of such as were well-affected &amp; well-wishers to our happy E∣stablishment; was look'd upon <HI>as clear shining after Rain.</HI></P>
<P>And now, SIR, methinks, You may hear the Lord speaking to You as he did to Joshua, <HI>Moses my Servant is dead, now therefore arise thou,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>As I was with Moses so will be with thee all the days of thy life: Be strong and of a good Courage; be strong and very Couragious, that thou mayest ob∣serve to do according to all the Law of Moses, turn not from it to the right Hand nor to the left: For then thou shalt make thy way Prosperous, and then thou shalt have good Success.</HI></P>
<P>So when <HI>David</HI> the chief Ruler in <HI>Israel</HI> (who had set his Affection to the House of God, and in whose heart it was to Build an House to his Name) died in a good old Age, full of Days, Riches &amp; Honour, <HI>as a shock of Corn cometh in its season</HI>; when he was grown ripe for Hea∣ven,
<PB N="42" REF="005066_0044_1016B6271AFD06F0"/>
was satisfied with long Life, <HI>i. e.</HI> had liv'd as long, as we may suppose he desir'd to live; <HI>Solomon</HI> (on whom the Eyes of all <HI>Israel</HI> were fix'd, and in whom was the Wisdom of God to do Judgment, which was the chief Ornament of <HI>Solomon</HI> even when he appear'd in all his glo∣ry) Succeeded him; of whom God had said, <HI>He shall Build an House for my Name: Moreover, I will Establish his Kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my Commandments and my Judgments, as at this Day.</HI></P>
<P>I am very sensible the work of <HI>Building Je∣rusalem</HI> at this Day under the present Situation of Affairs, is not altogether unlike what it was in <HI>Nehemiah's</HI> time. There is much Rubbish that needs to be cleared out of the way; and some <HI>Sanballat's</HI> and <HI>Tobiah</HI>' s (not to say <HI>Adonijah's</HI>) that conspire to discourage, obstruct, retard and hinder the Work: Insomuch that you may find occasion while you are building on the Wall, and have one Hand Employed in the Work, with the other to hold a Weapon. And God grant you may <HI>not bear the Sword in Vain.</HI> There are but too many Cursing <HI>Shimei's</HI> and Sons of <HI>Bichri,</HI> that <HI>blow the Horn</HI>; Men that <HI>despise Government,</HI> and are <HI>not afraid to speak Evil of Dignities</HI>; to <HI>Curse the Gods,</HI> and speak <HI>Evil of the Rulers</HI>; Licentious Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> (<HI>absque Jugo</HI>) who <HI>lift up the Horn,</HI> and speak <HI>with a stiff Neck</HI>; who <HI>fear not God neither regard

Man.</HI> Civil Rulers frequently find themselves obliged to tread <HI>Antipodes</HI> to some who lift up the Heel against them, and even kick against the pricks: <HI>Thorns there are that must be thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands; But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with Iron and the staff of a Spear.</HI></P>
<P>So they that wear Crowns must expect to feel the Thorns. Moreover, it is with Poli∣tical Bodies, as with Bodies Natural in a Fever and Ague, that have their up's &amp; down's; if one day tolerably well, the next worse again.</P>
<P>But yet, methinks, I hear your grand Em∣ployer saying to You for your Encouragement and Strengthning; as in Haggai, 2.4. <HI>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord, and work; for I am with you, &amp;c.</HI> Is not this the Word of the Lord to You, our Zerubbabel's? Zech. 4 6,—9.—<HI>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts. Who are thou, O great Mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a Plain, and he shall bring forth the head∣stone thereof with shouting, crying, Grace, grace unto it. The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the Foundation of this House, his hands shall finish it.</HI> There is no Wisdom nor Counsel, nor Under∣standing against the Lord. Isa. 8.9, 10. <HI>Asso∣ciate your selves, and ye shall be broken to pieces; take counsel together, and it shall come to nought: for God is with us.</HI> Since this work &amp; counsel
<PB N="44" REF="005066_0046_1016B62C61802C00"/>
is of God, none can overthrow it. <HI>The LORD doth Build up Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Honoured &amp; Worshipful,</HI> since You (like the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> of old, the Supreme Court or Grand Council of the <HI>Jews,</HI>) are now wait∣ing at the Tabernacle, that God may put his Spirit upon you; <HI>We wish You a Blessing out of the House of the Lord. May the Lord your God be with You as he was with</HI> JOSEPH, <HI>and make all you do to Prosper is your Hand. May the Holy Spirit accompanying the Word</HI> (which is Pure &amp; more Enlightning to the Eyes than the Honey which <HI>Jonathan</HI> tasted) <HI>make You of quick Un∣derstanding in the fear of the Lord, that you may have understanding of the Times, and know what our Israel ought to do, how to go out &amp; come in before us, and may under God be both our Sun &amp; our Shield. And having been faithful over a few things, you will finally be made Rulers over many things; and with a transporting Euge be admitted into the Joy of your Lord. AMEN.</HI></P>
<P>And that I may not be further tedious, what I say unto our Chief Rulers, I say unto all that are in Subordinate Places of Publick Trust of every Denomination; and to the whole <HI>Representative Body of this People now Con∣ven'd; viz.</HI> As you are under manifold special Advantages for it, so it must needs greatly be∣hove and concern you vigorously to Exert your selves in helping forward <HI>the Building up
<PB N="45" REF="005066_0047_1016B6A2CF12F2A0"/>
of Jerusalem.</HI> Perhaps, there never was more need than now of the Exercise of your Wis∣dom, Prudence, Fidelity, Zeal, Vigilancy, Re∣solution, Fortitude, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the common Safe∣ty &amp; Welfare. You will therefore (we trust) keep back nothing of these that may be pro∣fitable for us.— <HI>For your Brethren and Com∣panions sake, and because of the House of the Lord our God you will seek our good.</HI></P>
<P>I am sorry it has fallen to my Lot to stand in this sacred Desk, especially at such a Day &amp; Time as this is; <HI>A day of Trouble &amp; of tread∣ing down &amp; of Perplexity in this valley of Vision</HI>: But since his Honour has Commanded me here, You will suffer me to deliver my own Soul, to plead the Cause of God, and stand up for him against the Workers of Iniquity. And are there not many growing Evils and prevailing Sins, for which the Land Mourns, and which have a very awful tendency to Undermine our Foundations, to Sap our Walls, to Bury us in a general Desolation, and lay our Jerusalem utterly Waste? <HI>At which my heart trembleth &amp; is moved out of its place</HI>— And, <HI>Oh! that my head were Waters, and mine Eyes a fountain of Tears.</HI> And is there no Balm in <HI>Gilead</HI>? Can no Remedy be found out and apply'd for the Cure of <HI>this Wound of the Daughter of my People</HI>? Is there no way to stem the Stream and keep out the rising &amp; swelling Tyde of Sin &amp; Wick∣edness,
<PB N="46" REF="005066_0048_1016B62E258DA9A8"/>
which otherwise like a mighty Deluge Inundation, or wide-breaking in of Water, threatens to Overwhelm &amp; Destroy us? Is there no possible way to bridle the Tongues of such Prophane Persons, as dare take in Vain that Sacred &amp; Dreadful Name the Lord JEHOVAH, before whom Angels bow and Devils tremble — To give a check and put a stop to the shameful Prophanation of the Holy Sabbath; The growing neglect of God's Publick Worship; The forsaking the Assem∣bling of themselves together, <HI>as the Manner of some is,</HI> and setting up Schismatical Conventi∣cles, setting up <HI>Altar against Altar,</HI> and their <HI>Posts by God's Posts</HI>; and too much Symbolizing with the practise of those Times, wherein they said, — <HI>Let the men that Sacrifice kiss the Calves, Hos.</HI> 13.2.</P>
<P>I would humbly propose whether this be not an Iniquity to be Punished by the Judges, and whether in these Times, not of <HI>Ignorance</HI> but of <HI>great Light,</HI> these things should be con∣nived and winked at by any? Can nothing be done to heal our unhappy Divisions? To put a stop to, and prevent Unscriptural Separations &amp; Disorderly Practises of various kinds, which have a direct Tendency to, and by a natural Causality necessarily do, disturb the Peace of this our <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and greatly weaken the Walls of it? Practices concerning which we

may say as the Prophet did in another case, <HI>Hear this ye Old men, and give Ear all ye Inhabi∣tants of the Land; hath that been in your Days, or even in the Days of your Fathers? Joel.</HI> 1.2.</P>
<P>I desire, with others, to Adore God for all the genuine fruitys of the spirit visible among us; and for what of his Work he has been &amp; is carrying on in the Land: But yet think we have all reason to tremble <HI>for the Ark of God</HI>; if some Irregularities &amp; Extravagancies which are grown rise &amp; bare-fac'd &amp; but too notori∣ously known, be not timely Suppress'd.

<P>Surely, it must concern all that are Vested with Legislative or Executive Power and Au∣thority, to <HI>Remedy</HI> this as far as in them lies. Does not that Exhortation speak to all such?

Let us do the work of Evange∣lists, and make <HI>full proof of our Ministry.</HI> Let us not <HI>be afraid, tho' briars &amp; thorns be with us</HI> (as God said to the Prophet) and tho' we <HI>may dwell among Scorpions.</HI> Let us not be <HI>afraid of their words,</HI> nor <HI>dismayed at their looks, tho' they be a rebellions House.</HI> We that have God's Word, <HI>let us speak his Word faithfully; for what is the Chass to the Wheat? saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Let us not <HI>daub with untempered Mortar,</HI> nor <HI>prephesie smooth things,</HI> or <HI>say Peace to the wicked,</HI> to whom God saith, <HI>there is no peace.</HI> Let it grieve us to the heart to see any of our People <HI>pining away in their iniquities</HI>; and from a deep &amp; tender Compassion to them, employ all our Tho'ts &amp; contribute our utmost Endeavours; try &amp; try again <HI>to pluck them as brands out of the burning.</HI> As we are made Watchmen, so <HI>let us stand continually upon the Watch Tower,</HI> and not desert our Post. Let us not <HI>depart from the

Temple day nor night,</HI> left upon our departure <HI>grievous Wolves should enter in not sparing the Flock.</HI> Let us <HI>study to be quiet &amp; to do our own business,</HI> and not <HI>be busie bodies in other mens matters.</HI> Let us be <HI>Labourers</HI> and not <HI>Loyterers</HI> in our <HI>Lord's Vineyard.</HI> And then tho' all the winning, en∣dearing Methods of Perswasion should be dis∣regarded &amp; spurnd at by Sinners; and tho' they should deride &amp; laugh at <HI>the shaking of the glittering Spear</HI> of divine Comminations; should account the most awful weapons of our War∣fare but <HI>as stubbie, straw &amp; rotten wood.</HI> In a word, <HI>Tho' Israel should not be gathered, yet shall we</HI> (if we are faithful) <HI>be glorious in the Eyes of the Lord.</HI> And blessed shall we be if when <HI>our Lord comes he finds us so doing.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, it is a <HI>Difficult,</HI> but yet it is a <HI>good Work; a Sacred Function,</HI> an <HI>Exalted Service,</HI> a <HI>Noble Employment,</HI> an <HI>honourable, pleasant, desira∣ble &amp; delightful Work</HI>; the best we can be Em∣ployed in on this side glory. Angels &amp; Arch∣angels, Cherubims &amp; Seraphims do not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sdain to <HI>be ministring spirits to the heirs of Salvation.</HI> Nay, the incarnate JESUS tells us, <HI>He came not to be ministred unto, but to minister.</HI> And what faith our text? <HI>Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Be it so, that we are treated (by the licen∣tious Sons of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rah,</HI> or by any whose throat is an open Sepulchre &amp; their tongue an unruly Evil, full of deadly Poison, and set on fire of

Hell) as <HI>the Off-scouring of all things,</HI> made <HI>the Song of the Drunkard,</HI> or stigmatiz'd as <HI>Carnal, Pharisees, Hypocrites, Dumb Dogs,</HI> &amp; what not? Tis enough <HI>that the Disciple be as his Master, &amp; the Servant as his Lord.</HI> The world hated Christ before it hated his Ministers. <HI>If they call the Master of the house Beelzebub, no marvel if they call them of the Houshold so.</HI> Which brings to my mind a Stanza or two in a <HI>Funeral Elegy</HI> made by that sweet Singer of the <HI>British Israel,</HI> the very Pious &amp; Excellent Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> to the Me∣mory of the Reverend &amp; Renowned Mr. <HI>Thomas Gouge</HI>; of whom the Doctor says, <HI>Tho' he was so great &amp; good a Man, he did not escape Censure.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Ye Seraphs that surround the Throne,</L>
<L>Tell how his Name was through the Palace known,</L>
<L>How warm his Zeal was and how like your own.</L>
<L>Speak it aloud, let half the Nation hear,</L>
<L>And bold Blasphemers shrink and fear.</L>
<L>Impudent Tongues to blast a Prophet's Name;</L>
<L>The Poyson sure was fetch'd from Hell,</L>
<L>Where the old Blasphemers Dwell,</L>
<L>To taint the purest Dust &amp; blot the whitest Fame.</L>
<L>Impudent Tongues! You should be darted through,</L>

<L>Till Slander die with you.</L>

<P>Be it so that any of us by means of devoting our selves to this Work, are <HI>brought to a piece of Bread</HI>; Yet thanks be to our heavenly Fa∣ther, <HI>In his House there is Bread enough &amp; to spare.</HI> And e're long (if we are good &amp; faithful Ser∣vants) we <HI>shall eat Bread with him in his King∣dom
<PB N="54" REF="005066_0056_1016B6BEE23CA600"/>
of glory. Lord, evermore give us</HI> that <HI>Bread.</HI></P>
<P>Let us be frequently looking up to that glit∣tering and immortal Crown, that <HI>Crown of life &amp; glory</HI> which is promis'd to him that <HI>is faith∣ful unto the death.</HI> Which that we may all be, let us also be frequently lifting up our hands to the holy Oracle for <HI>Light Counsel, Direction, Assistance</HI> &amp; <HI>Success,</HI> in our work; and especially now when it seems to be such <HI>a Day</HI> as the Pro∣phet describes, Zech. 14 6, 7. <HI>And it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark; not day nor night.</HI> God grant that the <HI>Evening</HI> of it may prove Light. Our work is <HI>Onus humeris angelicis for midandum.</HI> But yet we know who has said, <HI>Lo, I am with you alway to the End of the world</HI></P>
<P>Let us be earnest &amp; incessant in our Requests at the Throne of grace in behalf of our dear Charge, resolving with the Prophet, Isa 62.1. <HI>For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, &amp; for Je∣rusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go sorth a brightness, &amp; the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</HI> We that make mention of the Lord should <HI>not keep silence,</HI> should give him <HI>no rest till be establish</HI> and till he <HI>make Jeru∣salem a Praise in the whole Earth.</HI> Let us then add to our faithful Endeavours our servent Prayers for the <HI>Peace</HI> &amp; <HI>Prosperity</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem. Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord weep be∣tween the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orch &amp; the Altar, and let them say, Spare thy People, O Lord; O God, thou hast been displeased,
<PB N="55" REF="005066_0057_1016B6C4EDAE1F50"/>
thou hast scattered us; thou hast made the Land to tremble, thou hast broken it: heal the breaches, for it shaketh. Where is thy Zeal, O Lord, and thy Strength, the sounding of thy Bowels &amp; thy Mercies, are they Restrained</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>To Conclude,</HI> Let all that now hear me be per∣swaded to unite your Strength and do all You can in your respective Places and according to your several &amp; different Talents, Abilities and Oppurtunities, to <HI>further the Building up of Je∣rusalem.</HI> As to the greater part of this Nume∣rous Assembly, I never expect to see Your faces more, till we hear the Sound of the last Trum∣pet, and all appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ. I would therefore leave this with You as <HI>my Dying Counsel.</HI> And, Oh! hearken to it; if you have any regard to God's Glory, to the Honour and Interest of our Dear Re∣deemer; if you have any Love to your Neigh∣bours, or to the dear Off-spring of your own Bowels; if you have any Regard to your own Safety, <HI>seek the Peace and Prosperity of this City, and pray to God for it; for in the Peace thereof ye shall have Peace.</HI></P>
<P>And here let me enter a Caveat against some things which have an undoubted tendency <HI>to pull down &amp; destroy,</HI> instead of <HI>Building up Jerusalem.</HI> Beware of that <HI>Luciferian Pride and Arrogancy,</HI> which prompts some to invade the Divine Pre∣rogative, to anticipate the Work of the Day of Judgment, to take upon them to Judge the Se∣crets
<PB N="56" REF="005066_0058_1016B6C675087E08"/>
of mens Hearts &amp; determine their State Godward, to Censure &amp; Condemn even those as Unconverted &amp; Hypocrites, <HI>of whom the world is not worthy.</HI> What is this better than that? Isa. 14.13. <HI>For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the Stars of God; I will be like the Most High.</HI> Those that teach this for Doctrine, <HI>understand neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Further,</HI> I beseech you, Brethren, <HI>Mark them which cause Divisions &amp; Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them: For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own Belly; and by good words and fair speaches deceive the hearts of the simple.</HI> The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is the Wisdom that is from above. The Kingdom of God is not Meat &amp; Drink, but Righteousness &amp; Peace; for he that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God &amp; approv'd of men. Where as divisive, separating Principles &amp; Practises are Condemn'd in Scripture as Works of the Flesh, and an Argument of a Carnal Mind. See 1 Cor. 3 2 4 <HI>For whereas there is among you Envying &amp; Strife &amp; Divisions, are ye not Carnal &amp; walk as men? For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another I am of Apollos, are ye not Carnal</HI>? See also <HI>Jam.</HI> 3 14, 16. A Church-rending, Unpeaceable, Party Spirit, is certainly a bid Spirit. How can one Edifie another, without following after the things that make for Peace? 'Tis true, our Sa∣viour
<PB N="57" REF="005066_0059_1016B6C80083CA48"/>
says, <HI>He came not to send Peace, but a Sword.</HI> But what Sword? Why not the Sword of Friends, but of Enemies to Christianity. For Christians to Hate, Persecute and Wound one another, this is like plunging a Spear into Christ's Sacred Side (whose <HI>Mystical Body</HI> the Churh is) 'tis Crucifying the Son of God afresh and putting of him to an open shame Alas! that the Blessed JESUS, the Prince of Peace, should be thus Wounded in the House of his Prosessed Friends! That his Seamless Coat should be rent in twain, like the Vail of the Temple, by those almost <HI>Unpresidented Schisms</HI> which have of late been made, and are still sub∣sisting in some of our Churches.</P>
<P><HI>Further still,</HI> Take that Caution given by the Inspired Preacher Prov. 24. 21 <HI>My son, Fear thou the Lord, and the King; and meddle not with them that are given to Change.</HI> As touching any Se∣cret Plots, of Intreagues against the State; and likewise as to those which are call'd Separate Meetings: Respecting the former, methinks, we have all reason to say as the holy Patriarch, <HI>O my Soul, come not thou into their Secret</HI>: And with respect to the latter, <HI>Unto their Assembly mine Honour be not thou United.</HI> The Calling of such Assemblies, is (I am perswaded) <HI>what God cannot away with: It is Iniquity,</HI> even their <HI>So∣lemn Meetings</HI>; For <HI>who hath required this at their hands</HI>? Those (God tells us) are <HI>a Smoke in his Nose,</HI> a <HI>Fire that burneth all the Day,</HI> who walk in
<PB N="58" REF="005066_0060_1016B6CF58088AC8"/>
<HI>a way that is not good,</HI> after their <HI>own Thoughts,</HI> that <HI>Sacrifice in Gardens, &amp;c.</HI> Which say, Stand <HI>by thy self, come not near to me▪ for I am holier than thou,</HI> Isa. 65. 2—5. To me it plainly appears (and therefore I am neither afraid nor asham'd to declare it as my Opinion) that diverse things relating to, and transacted in, these Separate Meetings, are a great Blemish to the Christian Name and Profession, directly contrary to the Religion of the Bible: particularly to that A∣postolick Rule, 1 Cor. 14.40 <HI>Let all things be done Decently &amp; in Order.</HI> That they are subversive of <HI>Peace, Discipline &amp; Government</HI>: Lay open the Sluices &amp; make a Gap to let in a Flood of Con∣fusion &amp; Disorder; and very awfully portend the Ruin of these Churches, unless a Stop be put to them. Should this spirit &amp; practise ge∣nerally obtain &amp; be in Vogue, we should soon find stretch'd out upon us, the <HI>Line of Confusion,</HI> and <HI>the Stones of Emptiness.</HI> This would soon be an <HI>Habitation of Dragons,</HI> &amp; <HI>a Court for Owls.</HI>—Wherefore let us beware less we throw the House out at the Windows, or pull it down upon our Heads. Lest our <HI>Bethels</HI> be converted into <HI>Bethavens</HI>; Lest our <HI>House of Prayer</HI> be haunted <HI>with Evil spirits,</HI> &amp; trun'd <HI>into Dens of Disorder, Confusion, Noise</HI> and <HI>Clamour</HI>; or into <HI>Dens of Thieves &amp; Robbers</HI>: And lest (as it has happen'd in some other parts of the world) our whole Land should become <HI>an Aceldama,</HI> a <HI>Field of Blood &amp; Slaughter</HI> on account of Religion.—<HI>Let
<PB N="59" REF="005066_0061_1016B6D297F3C278"/>
us not be high minded but fear.</HI> And, Oh! let us befiege the Throne of grace, that God would lead us into all Truth, &amp; not scatter Darkness in our Paths, nor suffer us to err from this ways.</P>
<P><HI>And now, Brethren, I commend you to God &amp; to the Word of his grace, which is able to build you up</HI>; and shall now shut up all with those words of the Holy Ghost in the Epistle of Jude,-<HI>Behold the Lord cometh with Ten thousands of his Saints, to excute Judgement upon all,&amp; to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts, and their mouth speaking great swelling words of vanity, having mens persons in ad∣miration because of advantage. But beloved, re∣member the words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, how that they told you that there should be meckers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts: These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. But ye beloved, builing up your selves on your most holy Faith, Praying in the Holy Ghost, Keep your selves in the Love of God. Looking for the Mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto Eternal Life. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the Presence of his glory with exceeding Joy. To the Only Wise God our Saviour, be Glory and Majesty, Dominion and Power, both now and ever.</HI> AMEN.</P>
