<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Kind Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW many people have fallen in the city of Philadelphia, by the <HI>pestilential Infection,</HI> is unknown to the Author—and he believes to the inhabitants of the same place; for the accounts are very different, as some mention four, others five, six, and even more than seven thousand: and the latter has been supposed to be not too large.—Some have given the <HI>disorder</HI> one name, and others another, &amp;c. It has been called a <HI>genuine Plague;</HI>—a <HI>putrid malignant Fever;</HI>—a <HI>yellow Fe∣ver,</HI> and a <HI>pestilential Infection.</HI> It seems that the <HI>mor∣tality</HI> began about the beginning of August, and raged with great violence till the weather grew colder.</P>
<P>THE Author has composed the following lines at his leisure hours, in which he has given a true description of the terrible effects of this contagion, according to the best information he has been able to obtain from recent publications; and as many people have called it a <HI>Plague,</HI> and as he knows not its proper name, he hopes he shall be excused for calling it so in the subsequent pages.—From, kind Reader, your's and the public's most obe∣dient humble servant,</P>

<HEAD>POETICAL LINES, On the DESTRUCTION of the Citizens of Phi∣ladelphia, by a pestilential Infection, A. D. 1793.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FROM Philadelphia comes a doleful sound,</L>
<L>Of thousands slain, and buried in the ground!</L>
<L>Who were alive and well three months ago;</L>
<L>But of their fate at that time did not know.</L>
<L>The young, the old, those of a middle age,</L>
<L>With rapid force, have been swept from the stage!</L>
<L>By an infection, which some people say</L>
<L>From distant lands, somehow, has found the way:</L>
<L>But some with boldness do this thing deny,</L>
<L>And say the <HI>venom</HI> from the earth did fly;</L>
<L>From <HI>filth</HI> expanded by <HI>Sol'</HI>s burning heat,</L>
<L>Or <HI>fumes</HI> proceeding from a dirty street;</L>
<L>Thus generated, did infect the air</L>
<L>With putrid exhalations ev'ry where,</L>
<L>Within the limits of the city's bound;</L>
<L>But not in places which the same surround.</L>
<L>In Water-street this <HI>mortal Plague</HI> began,</L>
<L>And with great slaughter through the city ran;</L>
<L>From house to house the dread contagion flew,</L>
<L>And on its way a num'rous train hath slew!</L>
<L>In diff'rent ways the exhalations strike,</L>
<L>And all the patients are not seiz'd alike;</L>
<L>Their constitutions diff'ring much likewise,</L>
<L>Make symptoms too of diff'rent kinds arise.</L>
<L>Some who were seiz'd, had on the first attack</L>
<L>Cold chills, and pains, both in the head and back,</L>
<L>And in their limbs, and also in their bones,</L>
<L>Exciting horror, gloom, and dismal groans!</L>
<L>Within the stomach humours did convene,</L>
<L>And vomiting did often supervene;</L>
<L>The bile was black, and putrid too indeed,</L>
<L>And haemorrhages sometimes did succeed;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="026206_0004_0FD02C4B78E27830"/>
The pulse run high, but often very low.</L>
<L>Sometimes too quick, and then as much too slow;</L>
<L>The eyes grew red, their pupils did dilate;</L>
<L>The fluids rush'd into a putrid state;</L>
<L>The thirst was great, the urine colour'd high;</L>
<L>The tongue turn'd white, the skin was hot and dry.</L>
<L>The dang'rous fever often did remit;</L>
<L>And was succeeded by an ague fit.</L>
<L>Sometimes eruptions rose upon the skin,</L>
<L>Exceeding thick on some, on others thin.</L>
<L>Amongst great numbers of the human race,</L>
<L>The putrefaction did gain ground apace:</L>
<L>Its raging force at last became so keen,</L>
<L>That <HI>death</HI> stept in, and clos'd the awful <HI>scene!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>About this <HI>Plague</HI> physicians disagree,</L>
<L>And other men, who from its <HI>virus</HI> flee:</L>
<L>Great numbers who have seen its raging flames,</L>
<L>By promulgation gave it diff'rent names,</L>
<L>Some say it is the <HI>pestilence,</HI> indeed,</L>
<L>Which from a foreign country did proceed.</L>
<L>Another name few men of skill do find,</L>
<L>Call it a fever of some <HI>yellow</HI> kind;</L>
<L>Think it arose, as we do understand,</L>
<L>By <HI>exhalations</HI> from the filthy land.</L>
<L>We are inform'd, that no man can deny,</L>
<L>That some knew not what med'cines to apply</L>
<L>For this <HI>disease,</HI> which ne'er was <HI>known</HI> before</L>
<L>To make an entrance on our solid shore!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The celebrated Doctor <HI>Rush</HI> did find,</L>
<L>That <HI>calomel,</HI> with <HI>jalap</HI> well combin'd,</L>
<L>Was the best <HI>purge,</HI> by far, that could be giv'n</L>
<L>By any <HI>medicaster</HI> under heav'n,</L>
<L><HI>Phlebotomy</HI> he highly recommends</L>
<L>To all <HI>physicians,</HI> and to other <HI>friends.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Evacuations</HI> of these kinds repress'd</L>
<L>The raging <HI>Plague,</HI> and thus sav'd the distress'd:</L>
<L>But <HI>antiseptics</HI> often were employ'd;</L>
<L>Till putrefaction was thereby destroy'd.</L>
<L>For my own part, I do applaud his <HI>plan,</HI></L>
<L>And, with esteem, call him a <HI>skilful man.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From his <HI>infection</HI> but few have been free,</L>
<L>But few exempt, of high or low degree,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="026206_0005_0FD02C556A1ED640"/>
Unless they have from the great city fled,</L>
<L>Before the <HI>virus</HI> o'er the same was spread;</L>
<L>Or have not been in that large place at all,</L>
<L>In August last, or any time this fall.</L>
<L>Some people <HI>fell,</HI> 'tis said, on the first day!</L>
<L>Though some liv'd longer, yet were swept away!</L>
<L>Sometimes an hundred in one day, 'tis said,</L>
<L>And often more, have in their graves been laid!</L>
<L>Some thousands by the putrefaction fell!</L>
<L>But some by chance have of the <HI>Plague</HI> got well.</L>
<L>The air <HI>corrupt,</HI> made people then believe</L>
<L>'Twas dang'rous for them in the same to breathe!</L>
<L>Hence many <HI>fled</HI> to keep off from its force,</L>
<L>And settled in the country towns of course;</L>
<L>The shops were shut, and business at a stand;</L>
<L>The Plague, 'twas thought, would desolate the land!</L>
<L>The people, pent as in a lonesome den,</L>
<L>Sell not their goods unto their countrymen;</L>
<L>The vessels too lay loaded by the shore,</L>
<L>For want of hands the num'rous goods to store;</L>
<L>The sweeping <HI>illness,</HI> by its rapid sail,</L>
<L>Did cause the markets in the town to fail!</L>
<L>For in the city ev'ry one did know,</L>
<L>The country people were afraid to go,</L>
<L>Lest the <HI>contagion</HI> they might thus convey,</L>
<L>Lose their own <HI>lives,</HI> and fill men with <HI>dismay!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps, by writing, no man can express</L>
<L>What people suffer'd in this great distress!</L>
<L>For want of <HI>food,</HI> some very hand did fare,</L>
<L>Some dy'd, no doubt, for want of <HI>proper care!</HI></L>
<L>Distressed objects on their beds did lie;</L>
<L>The want of help produc'd a dismal cry!</L>
<L>Their friends gone off, and their kind neighbours fled,</L>
<L>That they might not be number'd with the dead!</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>death</HI> and <HI>horror</HI> spread themselves around,</L>
<L>Young <HI>children</HI> were by their <HI>dead</HI> mothers found!</L>
<L>A shocking sight, indeed, for to behold!</L>
<L>Made the <HI>spectator'</HI>s very <HI>blood</HI> run cold!</L>
<L>Thus parents slain! their infants left so small,</L>
<L>Can't tell their names—some are not known at all!</L>
<L>The sad <HI>destruction</HI> made the people groan!</L>
<L>Bereav'd of wives, some Husbands live alone!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="026206_0006_0FCF57F045DFF7A0"/>
The widows too (it cannot be deny'd)</L>
<L>By this <HI>infection</HI> have been multiply'd.</L>
<L>The fatherless and orphans did increase,</L>
<L>Until the time the dreadful Plague did cease,</L>
<L>Which did commence, as we've been often told,</L>
<L>Upon the revolution of the cold;</L>
<L>Which soon <HI>condens'd</HI> the stagnant atmosphere,</L>
<L>And made the <HI>noxious vapours</HI> disappear;</L>
<L>Fall to the ground, where they in <HI>ambush</HI> stay,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Sol</HI> once more rolls on the northern way;</L>
<L>His <HI>heat</HI> may then the poison <HI>filth</HI> expand,</L>
<L>And <HI>desolate,</HI> for aught we know, the land!</L>

<HEAD>A FORM OF PRAYER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ALMIGHTY GOD, wilt thou thy people <HI>spare?</HI></L>
<L>Deliver them from this <HI>contagious snare!</HI></L>
<L>This <HI>mortal Plague</HI> at thy command began,</L>
<L>And thou thereby hast <HI>humbled</HI> sinful man!</L>
<L>Thou art the fountain of all good and love,</L>
<L>And dost thy will on earth—in heav'n above!</L>
<L>Thou givest life, thou givest health and ease,</L>
<L>To all thy creatures, just as thou dost please!</L>
<L>In thine own time thou smitest them with death,</L>
<L>Their bodies fall when thou dost take their breath!</L>
<L>Thou hast ordain'd that this shall be the fate</L>
<L>Of <HI>ev'ry creature</HI> in this mortal state!</L>
<L>These works of thine, if rightly understood,</L>
<L>Promote, we find, the universal good;</L>
<L>Remove thy <HI>children</HI> to a better <HI>shore,</HI></L>

<L>That to thy people thou hast been so kind,</L>
<L>That this contagion has been much confin'd:</L>

Confin'd, indeed, unto a narrow space,</L>
<L>Preventing death amongst the human race!</L>
<L>May all thus favour'd their glad voices raise,</L>
<L>In celebrating the <HI>Creator'</HI>s praise,</L>
<L>That he's been pleas'd in dang'rous times to save</L>
<L>Them from <HI>destruction</HI> and the <HI>silent grave!</HI></L>
<L>That on thy earth they're yet allow'd to dwell,</L>
<L>Whilst thousands by the pestilence have fell!</L>
<L>May all who from the raging Plague recover,</L>
<L>Their thankfulness unto the world discover,</L>
<L>By rend'ring praise to thee, the GOD above,</L>
<L>For preservation and thy boundless love;</L>
<L>For all the favours that from thee have came,</L>
<L>Especially for health's new kindled flame!</L>
<L>That strength is now to them restor'd again,</L>
<L>Whilst by thy will some of their friends are slain!</L>
<L><HI>Lord,</HI> wilt thou <HI>grant</HI> that those who've liv'd in <HI>sin,</HI></L>
<L>May all refrain, and a new life begin!</L>
<L>Live temperate, be holy, just, and pure,</L>

<L>IN Philadelphia has been slain,</L>

<L>Which now lie silent in the ground!</L>

<L>A pestilence, which there did rage</L>
