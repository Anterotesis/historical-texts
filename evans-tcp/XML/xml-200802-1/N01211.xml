<HEAD>The Time for Chusing Town-Officers drawing near, I shall express my regard to the good of the Town, by a brief Discourse on that Advice of JETHRO, viz.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Exod. 18. 21.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the People, Able men, such as fear God, men of Truth, Hating Covetousness; and place such over them, to be Rulers of thousands, and Rulers of Hun∣dreds, Rulers of Fifties, and Rulers of Tens.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE Read, <HI>Exod.</HI> 2. 18. That <HI>Moses</HI> fled from <HI>Pharaoh</HI> into the Land of <HI>Midian,</HI> and Married <HI>Zippo∣rah,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Jethro, the Priest or Prince of Midian.</HI> The reason why he is thus stiled, I conceive may be ga∣thered, by considering the Character that is given of <HI>Job. Job</HI> is supposed to be descended from <HI>A∣braham,</HI> and that he lived in the time between <HI>A∣braham</HI> and <HI>Moses;</HI> he was the Greatest Man of the East, not only as to <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Estate,</HI> but also in <HI>Majesty,</HI> and <HI>Authority;</HI> For, <HI>When he went out to the Gate through the City, when he prepared his Seat in the Street. The Young men saw him, and hid them∣selves, and the Aged arose, and stood up. The Princes refrained talking, and laid their hands on their mouth. The Nobles held their peace; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dwelt as King in the Army.</HI> Job 29. 7, 8, 9, 10, 25. Yet this <HI>Prince</HI> offer∣ed
<PB N="4" REF="001448_0003_0FB2F37E68B1DCA8"/>
Burnt-Offerings; <HI>Job</HI> 1. 5. Yea, his three Friends were directed to go to him with their Burnt-offer∣ing, and he was to Pray for them, which he did, and the Lord accepted him, <HI>Job</HI> 42. 8, 9, 10. Being thus consecrated by God, he might be stiled <HI>Priest,</HI> or <HI>Prince.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jethro</HI> was descended from <HI>Midian,</HI> the fourth Son of <HI>Abraham,</HI> by his Wife <HI>Keturah,</HI> Gen. 25. 2. and was <HI>Priest,</HI> or <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Midian.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Melchizedeck</HI> King of <HI>Salem,</HI> was <HI>Priest</HI> of the Most High God. <HI>Jethro</HI> owned, and worshipped the True God, <HI>Exod-</HI> 18. 12.</P>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> by express Command from God, departed from <HI>Midian</HI> to go into <HI>Egypt,</HI> taking his Wife and two Sons with him. <HI>Exod.</HI> 4. 20. But after God ma∣nifested his displeasure against him, for neglecting to Circumcise his Son; he sent his Wife and Chil∣dren back unto <HI>Jethro,</HI> who remained with him un∣til the happy Congress mentioned in this Chapter.</P>
<P>It is conceived that this part of the History is transposed; because it appears that this meeting was after the giving of the Law: when <HI>Moses</HI> sat as <HI>Judge;</HI> both to explain the Mind and Will of God to the People, and to determine matters in Controversy according to the Law. That it should therefore in point of time have been mentioned after the 10th verse of the 10th of <HI>Numbers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jethro</HI> had in his own Land, a general account of the wonderful deliverance God had granted his People <HI>Israel,</HI> from the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> under the Conduct of his Son-in-law <HI>Moses;</HI> and therefore moves towards him, with his Wife and Children;
<PB N="5" REF="001448_0004_0FB2F380AF73FAD0"/>
<HI>Moses</HI> went out to meet him; and after the joyful Congratulation, and they were come into the Tent, <HI>Moses</HI> gives him a more particular account of the merciful and wonderful dispensations of Divine Providence towards <HI>Israel,</HI> since he left him in <HI>Mi∣dian.</HI></P>
<P>This filled the heart of the Good old man with joy, <HI>which he expressed, by acknowledging the trans∣cendent Glory, and excellency of the God of Israel; by offering of Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices, and feasting with</HI> Aaron, <HI>and the Elders of Israel before God,</HI> Exo. 18. 12. so joyning with the Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> in the Solemn Worship of God.</P>
<P>The day following, <HI>Moses</HI> sat to judge the peo∣ple, who stood before him from morning to even∣ing; which his wise Father-in-law observing, testi∣fied his dislike of, as a method that would be very prejudicial both to himself, and also to the people: to prevent the inconvenience, he proposeth an ex∣pedient; yet, as a good, as well as a wise man, submits to the determination of God himself, <HI>v.</HI> 23. <HI>If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall go to their place in peace.</HI> His advice was to provide out of all the people, a certain number of Officers, who might bear the burthen with <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> was sensible of the necessity of complying with this advice, and acknowledged <HI>before the Con∣gregation, that he was not able by himself alone, to bear their cumbrance, their burthen and their strife.</HI> Deut. 1. 12. The people therefore, having by his direction, Chosen a sufficient number of persons for
<PB N="6" REF="001448_0005_0FB2F3831C96B5D8"/>
divers Offices; <HI>Mose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> made them Heads over <HI>Isra∣el</HI> in several Districts, with a most solemn Charge; saving to them, <HI>Hear the Causes between your Bre∣thren, and judge righteously between every man, and his brother, and the Stranger that is with him; ye shall not respect persons in judgment, but you shall hear the small, as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is Gods; and the Cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</HI> Deut. 1▪ 16, 17.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divine Approbation</HI> of this advice, is mani∣fest by that standing Law, <HI>Deut.</HI> 16. 18. <HI>Judges and Officers shalt thou make thee in all thy Gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy Tribes, and they shall judge the people with just judgment, thou shalt not wrest judgment, thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the Righteous; that which is altogether just (Justice, Justice) shalt thou follow.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly that great Reformer, King <HI>Jehosha∣phat</HI> set <HI>Judges in the Land, throughout all the fenced Cities of</HI> Judah, <HI>City by City▪</HI> with the like solemn Charge, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19. 5, 6, 7. He said to the Judges, <HI>Take heed what you do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment; where∣fore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of Gifts.</HI></P>
<P>In the words of the Text, <HI>Jethro</HI> manifests both his Wisdom, and his Piety, in directing not only to a suitable number of Officers; but to those qualifi∣cations
<PB N="7" REF="001448_0006_0FB2F388DEE69178"/>
which were necessary for the discharge of their duty, in their several Stations.</P>
<P><HI>Jethro</HI> mentions four qualifications; Able men, such as fear God, men of Truth, hating Covetous∣ness: <HI>Moses</HI> mentions three more, Wise men, and Understanding, and known among your Tribes, <HI>Deut.</HI> 1. 13. Under these seven, all other good Qualities and Vertues being comprehended; I shall briefly explain, and distinguish them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Wise men,</HI> men of Sagacity, of an acumen or sharpness of understanding, easily, and speedily to penetrate into the nature and qualities of things; men of large Capacities; in a degree answering the Character of <HI>Solomon▪ to whom God gave largeness of heart, even as the Sand on the Sea shoar,</HI> 1 King. 4. 29. Men who have right Ideas, notions and con∣ceptions, and that in great abundance; men that can discern the true sence of the Law; and distin∣guish between things that differ: between plea and plea; and not be imposed on by the Sophistry of those who would pervert Justice and Judgment, for filthy lucres sake.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Men of Understanding, h. e.</HI> of prudence and discretion; <HI>for wisdom dwells with prudence, and finds out knowledge of witty inventions,</HI> Prov. 8. 12. men that know how to dispose things into a due method and order, in the proper time and season; that matters may appear in a clear light, and that Jus∣tice may not be deferred, or delayed; delays of∣ten proving more pernicious than a wrong Judg∣ment.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Men known among your tribes,</HI> not obscure men,
<PB N="8" REF="001448_0007_0FB2F389A4D55A10"/>
who hide their Talents in a Napkin; but who have appeared to be of a Publick Spirit, and have given proof of their ability, and fidelity; men of experi∣ence, and who deserve a good repute among their Neighbours; as Persons fit for Publick Service.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Able men,</HI> strong men, men of Fortitude, Cou∣rage and Resolution, that will not be diverted from their duty by frowns, nor smiles; men that have an antipathy against Flatterers, and Flattery; men that will dare to do Justice, though there are dif∣ficulties and dangers in the way.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Fearing God;</HI> not <HI>Atheists,</HI> nor <HI>Deists,</HI> but who know and own the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent; Men who have a prin∣ciple of Holy Fear in their hearts; consider them∣selves as placed in their Stations by Divine Provi∣dence, to act therein for God, to whom they are accountable; Men that dare do nothing contrary to the Mind of God, because they fear him: that dare do all that God Commands, because they fear him, relying on his protection for their defence and security.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Men of Truth,</HI> or, <HI>True men;</HI> not men of a dou∣ble heart, nor double tongue; not <HI>Hypocrites, lest the people be ensnared,</HI> Job 34. 30. Men that love Truth, study Truth, speak Truth, and will plead for Truth; Men of Faith, whose words and promi∣ses may be relyed on; Men who will keep <HI>Faith</HI> with the Publick; and be very careful to maintain, and preserve the <HI>Publick Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Men hating Covetousness;</HI> as an Evil most de∣structive to Humane Society; no mans Life, Estate
<PB N="9" REF="001448_0008_0FB2F38B233365F8"/>
or Interest is secure, where <HI>Covetousness</HI> reigns. <HI>Naboth</HI> found it so; because he would not part with his Fathers Inheritance, to satisfie the <HI>covetous</HI> desire of <HI>Ahab,</HI> a method was found to destroy his Life, that his Vineyard might be possessed by that <HI>Ahab,</HI> who tho' a King, made himself a Slave, <HI>Sel∣ling himself to work evil in the sight of the Lord,</HI> 1 King. 21. 20. Therefore in Chusing Publick Of∣ficers, be sure to avoid <HI>Covetous men;</HI> let them be men <HI>Hating Covetousness.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> to be insisted on, is only this▪</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL> In Chusing Persons for Publick Offices, and Employ∣ments, there ought to be special care that they are men, Hating Covetousness.</P>
<P>For the clearing and proving of this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> I shall insist on two Propositions.</P>
<P>Proposition I. <HI>In Chusing of Persons for Publick Of∣fices and Employments, respect ought to be had to their Qualifications for such Offices and Employments.</HI></P>
<P>This is so evident to the light of nature, that no rational man will Chuse a <HI>Servant,</HI> or a <HI>Slave</HI> that is not fit for the work he designs him.</P>
<P>Here Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Choice is a free, deliberate and distinguishing act of the Mind.</HI> In this case, it is supposed that di∣vers
<PB N="10" REF="001448_0009_0FB2F39154B9FFF0"/>
persons stand as <HI>Candidates</HI> for such an Office or Employment. Every Elector hath a determi∣ning Vote, <HI>as far as it respects himself,</HI> which of the two is best qualified for such a Station, and by his Choice testifyeth a peculiar respect to the person he thinks most worthy.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As there are different Offices and Employments▪ so there are different Gifts which adapt, or fit for such Offices; and different measures and degrees of those Gifts. The Father of lights;</HI> from whom every good and perfect gift comes, doth distribute <HI>common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> for the good and benefit of Humane Society▪ as well as <HI>Spiritual Gifts, for the benefit of the Church;</HI> distributing to every one severally as he will; all are adapted to some use or service: The greatest <HI>Prince</HI> cannot say to the meanest <HI>Peasant,</HI> I have no need of thee▪ for <HI>the King himself is served by the field,</HI> Eccles. 5. 9. not only by the produce of the field, but by the labour of the Husbandman that worketh in the Field. Now Choice ought to have respect to <HI>Divine Providence;</HI> considering who is it that the Supreme Governour of the World doth <HI>indigitate; or point me to,</HI> as fitted for such a Station, by the qualifications he hath bestowed up∣on him? Election of Officers ought to be attended unto with seriousness, looking up to God for dire∣ction, his Glory is concerned in their management; the judgment is Gods; and they ought to act in his name and fear, for his Glory.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To have a liberty for Choice, and not to respect qualifications, is to trifle in a matter of greatest im∣portance;</HI> it is to slight a priviledge, which some
<PB N="11" REF="001448_0010_0FB2F392A563F9C8"/>
<HI>Heathens</HI> would sooner part with their Lives, then their Children should be deprived of: It is to i∣mitate the Sin and Folly of <HI>Esau, who for a morsel of meat fold his birth-right.</HI> Oh! how often do men suffer themselves to be imposed on by those who seek their own Interest, by their neglect or credu∣lity▪ little Emissaries are often imployed, by falss representations to divert from the Choice of the most Useful and Vertuous, and to engage a party to serve the <HI>Covetous.</HI> Oh! how often have flou∣rishing Cities and Countreys been lost, ruin∣ed and spoiled of all their Glory, by <HI>ungrateful</HI> 80 <HI>perfidious Hypocrites,</HI> who were Chosen to serve the Publick Interest. It is therefore of the <HI>last impor∣tance,</HI> in chusing persons to Publick Offices, to have respect to their <HI>Qualifications, That they be wise, un∣derstanding, known among the tribes, able men, fear∣ing God, men of Truth, Hating Covetousness.</HI> Which leads to the second Proposition.</P>
<P>Proposition II. <HI>In Chusing persons to be Publick Of∣ficers, there ought to be special care, that they be men hating Covetousness.</HI> The holy Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in giv∣ing the qualifications for Bishops and Deacons, doth in a very particular manner warn against the <HI>Co∣vetous. A Bishop must be blameless,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>not greedy of filthy lucre, not covetous; likewise the Deacons must be grave,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>not greedy of filthy lucre.</HI> 1 Tim. 3. 3, 8. Tit. 1. 7. <HI>not given to filthy lucre.</HI> As <HI>Covetous</HI> Bi∣shops and Deacons are a pest to the Church, so are <HI>Covetous</HI> Officers to the State.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="001448_0011_0FB2F394E08F3868"/>
In clearing this Proposition, I shall answer three Questions.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>What is Covetousness?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>Who may be said to be men hating Cove∣tousness?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>Why ought there be special care that per∣sons chosen to publick Offices, should be men hating Co∣vetousness?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>What is Covetousness?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. G.</HI> I intend only to explain the nature of the evil, in general; and not to discourse of the vari∣ous ways &amp; methods wherein this Sin doth appear.</P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Covetousness is sometimes used as a term that comprehends all irregular and inordinate inclinations, and motions of the Soul towards forbidden Objects;</HI> the first motions of depraved nature towards sin; the first <HI>Issues</HI> of Indwelling sin, are termed <HI>Covet∣ing, or Lusting.</HI> Rom. 7. 7. <HI>I had not known lust, or concupiscence, except the law had said, thou shalt not Covet; but sin taking occasion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of Concupiscence. Thus, e∣very man is tempted when be is drawn aside of his own lust, and enticed; then when lust▪ hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</HI> Jam. 1. 14, 15. <HI>Thus, every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart, are only evil continual∣ly.</HI> Gen. 6. 5. And the employment of the <HI>Unregenerate</HI> is to fulfil <HI>the wills or desires of the flesh and of the mind▪</HI> all their labour and toil, their risques &amp; hazards, are only to this end; <HI>to make provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof,</HI> Rom. 13. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>A. 2. <HI>Covetousness is commonly taken in a more li∣mited
<PB N="13" REF="001448_0012_0FB2F39727A00B00"/>
or restrained sence, for a peculiar sort or kind of lust, distinguished from other lusts by a particular Ob∣ject.</HI> The holy Apostle distinguisheth the several sorts of lusts that are in the world, into three heads. <HI>The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. Covetousness</HI> is a lust of the eyes, having Riches for the Object; The holy Apostle saith, <HI>The love of mony is the root of all evil. Covetousness</HI> is the first expression of that <HI>love,</HI> which is predomi∣nant in them that will be rich.</P>
<P><HI>Covetousness is a distemper of</HI> the <HI>Soul, which mani∣fests itself in a constant, greedy, insatiable desire</HI> after <HI>Riches, and employeth</HI> the <HI>whole man in various me∣thods to gratifie that desire.</HI> More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is a distemper of</HI> the <HI>Soul seeking after Rich∣es; a Covetous man is one that will be rich,</HI> 1 Tim. 6. 9. <HI>Riches, Mammon,</HI> is their chiefest good, and last end, their <HI>Idol,</HI> and they are termed <HI>Idolaters,</HI> Eph. 5. 5. I term it a distemper of the Soul, on a double account. (1.) <HI>To shew</HI> that <HI>it is seated in, and pro∣ceeds from a Soul</HI> that <HI>hath lost its Original Rectitude.</HI> It proceeds from the heart of man as depraved with Original Sin, Mat. 7. 22. <HI>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Covetousness.</HI> Man being made after the Image of God, and for the enjoyment of God as his <HI>chiefest good, and last end;</HI> while he re∣mained in his Integrity, there was a blessed calm and serenity in his mind; a Harmony; all his mo∣tions were regular, he fought his happiness in the way God had appointed, improving all the Creatures to load him unto his rest <HI>in God.</HI> But hav∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that happiness, he is a <HI>restless Creature▪</HI> seek∣ing
<PB N="14" REF="001448_0013_0FB2F399960A5968"/>
it where he can, under the conduct of an erro∣neous, and vain mind, preferring meer <HI>trifles</HI> be∣fore the most <HI>substantial good;</HI> some seek a happi∣ness in <HI>sensual pleasures,</HI> running into <HI>excess and ri∣ot;</HI> others seeking after <HI>Honours,</HI> and <HI>Preferments▪</HI> But the <HI>Covetous</HI> man (who esteemeth himself the wisest of the three) saith, <HI>mony answers all things;</HI> if I can but get enough of that, I can purchase <HI>Ho∣nours</HI> and <HI>Pleasures;</HI> therefore laying aside all other designs, but what are subservient to his main end, he saith, <HI>he will be rich.</HI> (2.) <HI>Covetousness is term∣ed a distemper,</HI> to distinguish it from a lawful, li∣mited desire after a competent portion of the good things of this life, for the support of our selves, &amp; those under our Charge, according to our several Stations. <HI>Our Heavenly Father knoweth that we have need of these things;</HI> and requires us in the di∣ligent use of <HI>proper</HI> means, to manifest our depen∣dance on him for such a competency; hence we are directed to pray <HI>for our daily bread;</HI> that <HI>God would feed us with food convenient for us;</HI> that which is a competency for a single person, is not for a Family; and that which is a competency for an <HI>Husbandman,</HI> is not for a <HI>Prince.</HI> That God who hath ordained <HI>Publick Offices,</HI> Sacred and Civil, and calleth persons whom he qualifieth for such Stati∣ons, therein to abide with him, attending on the duty of their Callings; alloweth them a <HI>suitable support.</HI> There is <HI>an accursed Levelling</HI> Spirit in the World, which I cannot testifie against with a <HI>suf∣ficient indignation; It will starve Religion &amp; Learn∣ing out of a Land;</HI> those of this temper would hard∣ly
<PB N="15" REF="001448_0014_0FB2F39DAF8FB860"/>
allow so much to <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Ecclesiastical Officers</HI> as to the <HI>meanest Artificer,</HI> or <HI>Day Labourer.</HI> This is contrary to distributive Justice, and the Rule there∣of. The holy Apostle, who saith, <HI>Rulers</HI> are the <HI>Ministers of God for good: h. e.</HI> to those under their Government; requires, <HI>for this cause to pay tribute</HI> also, <HI>for</HI> they <HI>are Gods Ministers,</HI> attending <HI>continu∣ally upon this very thing; Render therefore to all their dues▪ Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Custom to whom Custom is due, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour.</HI> And due it is, on the same account the people said to <HI>David,</HI> Thou art worth <HI>Ten Thousand of us,</HI> 2 Sam. 18. 3. So in proportion, the Service which Righteous, Wise and Faithful Officers do for the Publick, is <HI>vastly more</HI> than what <HI>many Labour∣ers</HI> can do by their Industry. Thus an <HI>Ingenious man</HI> often by a single proposal, doth save more to the Publick Treasury; or directs to a method for gaining more than a <HI>Labouring</HI> man can procure by his Industry in many years; the Use and Service of such men is beyond what the Vulgar can dis∣cern: If their Service then be more in proportion, so ought their <HI>Support</HI> to be; but <HI>Covetousness</HI> is a distemper that will not allow <HI>Tribute, to whom Tri∣bute is due.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Covetousness is a continual, greedy and insatia∣ble desire after Riches.</HI> (1.) It is a <HI>constant, continu∣al desire, they covet all be day long:</HI> these are of the daughters of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> crying, <HI>Give, give▪</HI> These <HI>Covetous desires</HI> are as the <HI>pulse</HI> of their Souls, never ceasing so long as life lasts: Give, give, is their const<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t Tone. The holy Prophet describing

the Covetous Rulers of <HI>Israel,</HI> saith, Hos. 4. 18. <HI>Her Rulers with shame love Give ye.</HI> Or her <HI>Shields love Give ye, which is a shame; h. e.</HI> Her Rulers, who should be as Shields, and called Shields, <HI>Psal.</HI> 47. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

(2.) <HI>It is a greedy desire after wealth▪</HI> they are <HI>greedy of filthy lucre:</HI> This denotes the eager∣ness and vehemence of the desire. <HI>Covetousness</HI> is that in <HI>Morals,</HI> which <HI>Physicians</HI> in <HI>Naturals,</HI> term a <HI>Canine Appetite;</HI> they eat with greediness like Dogs. Thus the holy Prophet describes the <HI>Watch∣men</HI> of <HI>Israel: Watchmen</HI> were either <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> or <HI>Civil</HI> Rulers; of such he saith, <HI>Isa.</HI> 56. 10. <HI>Her Watchmen</HI> are <HI>blind, they are all ignorant,</HI> they are <HI>all dumb dogs</HI> that <HI>cannot bark, sleeping, lying down, loving</HI> to <HI>slumber; yea,</HI> they <HI>are greedy dogs, which can never have enough, and</HI> they <HI>are Shepherds</HI> that <HI>cannot understand, they all look to their own ways, e∣very one</HI> to <HI>his gain from his quarter, Come ye say</HI> they, <HI>I will</HI> fetch <HI>wine, and we will fill our selves with strong drink, and</HI> to morrow <HI>shall be as</HI> this <HI>day, and much more abundantly.</HI> Or, we read their greedy appetite described, Zeph. 3. 3. <HI>Her Princes within her, are roaring Lions; her Judges are evening wolves,
<PB N="17" REF="001448_0016_0FB2F3A0EA090450"/>
they gnaw</HI> not <HI>the bones till the morning.</HI> They are so greedy, they leave nothing to be eaten on the morrow they devour all presently: yet some of them are so considerate, <HI>they tear in pieces for their Whelps;</HI> the small morsels they rend and tear <HI>from the poor and needy, must satisfie the Lions Whelps, they strangle for their Lionesses; their Queens and their Concubines must have whole Carcases,</HI> the plun∣der of <HI>Cities</HI> and <HI>Towns</HI> to prey upon; they fill their dens with Ravin, their Stately Palaces are furnished and adorned, their Magazines stored with the Spoils of Kingdoms. (3.) <HI>Covetousness is an un∣satiable desire after Riches, they never say they have enough.</HI> It was observed of old, that the love of Mony encreaseth with the enjoyment, &amp; the Scrip∣ture confirms it; for it is written, Eccl. 5. 10. <HI>He that loveth silver, shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase.</HI> It is part of the Curse of God on man for his Apostacy: It is just, that those who forsake their <HI>own mercy▪</HI> should be left to observe, and pursue after <HI>Lying Vanities,</HI> Jonah 2. 8. It is just, that those who <HI>for∣sake the fountain of living waters,</HI> should be left to the toy I and expence of <HI>hewing out cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</HI> Sometimes persons do project to fill the desires of the <HI>Covetous at once;</HI> hoping thereby to have some rest from their de∣mands, that they will cease from their old cry, <HI>Give, give;</HI> but alas! they may as well think to quench the fire with Oyl; they do but put them into a capacity to do them the more mischief: at first with more modesty they say▪ <HI>Give ye,</HI> but in a
<PB N="18" REF="001448_0017_0FB2F3A263C69D78"/>
little time they will say, <HI>you shall Give;</HI> they lay out what you give, to purchase the opportunity, &amp; to <HI>prepare,</HI> and <HI>shape the tools</HI> to force open your locked treasures. <HI>They enlarge their desire as Hell and as death, they cannot be satisfied.</HI> Hab. 2. 5. ne∣ver, never say, it is enough. (4.) <HI>This greedy and unsatiable desire issues in a sullen discontent</HI> if they are disappointed: <HI>They wander up &amp; down for meat, and grudge if they are not satisfied.</HI> Psal. 59. 15. they are like that <HI>Ahab,</HI> that covetous <HI>Ahab,</HI> who <HI>went to his house heavy and displeased, lying down on his bed, turning away his face, and would eat no bread; because</HI> Naboth <HI>denied him his Vineyard.</HI> 1 Kin. 21.</P>
<P>Or, they are like those false Prophets, mention∣ed, Mic. 3. 5. <HI>if any put not into their mouths, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prepare war against them.</HI> They are full of Cursing, and bitterness; and will employ all their little Emissaries to defame, hurt and destroy those who obstruct their unjust gain: if they once get them into their clutches, they will deal with them like those Pyrates mentioned, Prov. 1. 12. <HI>Swallow them up alive like the grave, and whole, as those that go down to the Pit.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Covetousness employeth the whole man, and all his interests, to obtain their desires.</HI> The <HI>Golden Ball</HI> is before them, they will stretch forth, press for∣ward, run swiftly, and expose themselves to utmost perils, to obtain it. (1.) <HI>It employeth their minds; Covetous</HI> men have their <HI>hearts exercised with cove∣tous practices,</HI> I Pet. 2. 14. They are intent on get∣ting gain; they have many subtil <HI>artifices</HI> and <HI>de∣vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> to manage; sometimes they are contriving,
<PB N="19" REF="001448_0018_0FB2F3A4ADEBD048"/>
to remove obstructions; sometimes to prevent dis∣covery, that they may act with secrecy, that they may not be mistrusted; sometimes in supplanting their Rivals; sometimes in finding out, &amp; shaping tools to be used in their Service; &amp; when all things are ready, to know the best methods, and fittest seasons for accomplishment. They spend many waking ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in imagining mischief <HI>upon their b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds:</HI> as <HI>the abundance of the rich will not suffer them to sleep;</HI> so the <HI>hungry, greedy appetite of the Covetous,</HI> (gnawing with anxious cares) will not permit them to sleep; they must resolve these Questions: <HI>What shall I eat? What shall; I drink? Wherewith shall I be cloathed? Or, how shall I increase my trea∣sures?</HI> before they can give <HI>sleep to their eyes,</HI> or <HI>slumber to their eye-lids.</HI> Thus are their minds em∣ployed. (2.) <HI>Their buisy minds call them no to acti∣on; they must rise up early, and set up late, &amp; eat the bread of sorrows,</HI> bereaving themselves of the com∣mon comforts of life, that they may perform their enterprize. The holy Prophet thus describes their industry. <HI>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the Prince asketh, and the Judge asketh for a reward, and the Great man he uttereth his mischie∣vous device;</HI> and so they wrap it up, or twist it to∣gether; taking as much pains as those who twist Cables of the largest dimensions; they will spare no pains to effect their purposes. (3.) <HI>Covetousness doth not only employ their Persons, but their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Friends, &amp; their Purses to get more gain.</HI> They mistake, who think Covetous persons are always nig∣gardly, they will make very expensive Feasts, when
<PB N="20" REF="001448_0019_0FB2F3A6F2B097D0"/>
they know how to make others pay the Reckoning. They employ their <HI>Children,</HI> their <HI>Servants,</HI> their <HI>Neighbours,</HI> their <HI>Tenants,</HI> their <HI>Friends,</HI> with all others who come under their influence, to Serve in several Stations, and by various methods; some Tools they shape by <HI>flattery</HI> and <HI>fawning;</HI> some by <HI>frowns</HI> and <HI>threats;</HI> some must serve them by <HI>admiring,</HI> &amp; <HI>praising</HI> them; some by their <HI>Pens,</HI> &amp; some by their <HI>Purses;</HI> &amp; to them Gain is sweet, out of whatever it be ex∣tracted.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>Who may be termed men hating Covetous∣ness?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>These who studying the holy Scriptures, have the same thoughts and resentment of this sin, and of those who are under the dominion of it, the Scripture d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th require.</HI> It is the advice of the Blessed Jesus; <HI>Take heed and beware of Covetousness;</HI> and all his true Disciples observe that caution. <HI>Covetous</HI> men are sometimes by their <HI>Flatterers,</HI> termed <HI>thrifty, frugal, sparing, good Husbands;</HI> they are men of <HI>fine parts,</HI> and <HI>great abilities,</HI> only a little too selfish; too much set upon the World: But what saith the Scripture? It saith, Eph. 5. 3. <HI>Covetousness, let it not be once named amongst you, as becometh Saints: g. d. Covetousness</HI> is an evil so <HI>hateful to God,</HI> so di∣rectly opposite to the whole tenour of the Gospel, to the <HI>terms,</HI> the <HI>precepts;</HI> and to the blessed <HI>pattern</HI> and <HI>example</HI> of the <HI>Holy Jesus;</HI> that you ought to abstain from the very <HI>appearance</HI> of it; that there may not, from the least degree of it in you, be any occasion to mention it; and never speak of it with∣out abhorrence. But consider further, (1.) When

the Holy Scriptures give the Characters of those who are excluded from the Kingdom of Heaven; the <HI>covetous</HI> are numbred among them. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. <HI>Know ye not the Unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God; be not decerved, nor thieves, nor Covetous▪ no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Whoremonger, nor Covetous man, who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ, and of God.</HI> Eph. 5. 5.

in admiration because of advantage.</HI> But behol∣ding their face in the glass of the Word; look on them as the most deformed monsters pretending to Christianity.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By men hating Covetousness,</HI> I intend those who are of a free, generous, noble, Princely Spirit, re∣sembling the Children of a King, yea, the <HI>King of Kings▪</HI> those Heaven-born Souls, who bear the I∣mage of their Heavenly Father, <HI>who makes his Sun to rise on the evil, and on the good; and sendeth Rain on the just, and on the unjust,</HI> Mat. 5. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>Q. 3. <HI>Why ought there to be so much care to Chuse men hating Covetousness, for Publick Officers?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Covetous men will do no good to the Publick. h. e.</HI> they have no real, direct intentions to serve the <HI>Publick Interest:</HI> they often by <HI>accident,</HI> and by serving their <HI>own interest,</HI> do some good; but this is not their design. You may as well expect the Stream will rise above the Fountain, as think that <HI>Covetous</HI> men will act above the principle of <HI>self-love;</HI> this is the first spring of action, and this their center; here their thoughts, designs, cares &amp; endeavours terminates <HI>I will be Rich.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="001448_0022_0FB2F3AF085627C0"/>
A. 2. <HI>Covetous men will hinder</HI> others <HI>from doing good;</HI> they hate those who are of a Publick Spirit: they know their proposals will interfere with their private interest; therefore they will what they can, blast their reputation, find fault with their Schemes for the Publick Service; they will to the utmost of their power, by themselves and Agents, stop, clog, hinder, obstruct; and if possible, subvert and overthrow whatever may thwart their private Interests.</P>
<P>A. 3. <HI>Covetous men will do much hurt to the Pub∣lick.</HI> For, (1.) Their predominant principle influ∣enceth them thereto; for <HI>the love of mony is</HI> the root <HI>of all evil,</HI> 1 Tim. 6. 10. Many foolish and hurtful lusts spring from this root, such as <HI>Lying, Fraud, Cheating, Bribery, Usury,</HI> &amp;c. besides, it in∣clines to all other sins that may subserve this great design of getting mony. What will a <HI>Covetous man</HI> stick at to accomplish his design? They are Time-servers, and Men-pleasers, and will turn with every wind: They often prostitute themselves to the greatest abominations in compliance with the lusts of men, in order to obtain their end. It will make <HI>Princes</HI> the <HI>companion of Thieves.</HI> Isa. 1. 23. (2.) There is nothing will obstruct, or hinder them, they will break all bonds, both Sacred and Civil, rather than be restrained from getting Mo∣ny. Indeed they will seem to be Religious, it may be boast of their Conversion to God, and their as∣surance of an Heavenly Inheritance; and appear devout in the Temple, grave and sober in their de∣portment. when there are <HI>seven abominations in
<PB N="24" REF="001448_0023_0FB2F3B223AAD048"/>
their hearts,</HI> Prov. 26. 25. <HI>They lie</HI> unto <HI>God</HI> with their <HI>lips, they flatter him with</HI> their tongue, <HI>they come before him with images of Jealousie in their hearts;</HI> Mammon is the God they worship, and their hearts go after their <HI>Covetousness;</HI> and there∣fore <HI>depart from the faith,</HI> and turn <HI>aside from the Holy Commandment,</HI> when in pursuit after Riches &amp; Honour. No Oaths will hold them, they will swear to do Justice, and yet take a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to pervert Judg∣ment. They will swear Allegiance to their Prince, and correspond with their Enemies. Oh! how ma∣ny Cities, and Strong Holds have been delivered up! how many Free-born Subjects have been bought and sold like Slaves, to satisfie the greedy appetite of the <HI>Covetous.</HI> No principles of Honour will ob∣lige them, they will not spare their nearest Relati∣ons, they will be <HI>cruel</HI> to their <HI>own flesh;</HI> they <HI>will speak you fair,</HI> and <HI>flatter with their lips,</HI> when <HI>war is in their hearts:</HI> they will pretend to kiss, when they design to <HI>smite under the fifth rib,</HI> 1 Sam. 20. 10. There can be no true friendship with a Cove∣tous man, he will betray his most intimate friend for a little mony. <HI>Covetous men will do much hurt to the Publick.</HI> (1.) <HI>By their Example;</HI> Covetousness is a very spreading evil: when men see others <HI>thrive, prosper, succeed in</HI> the <HI>world, grow rich and a∣bound;</HI> they enquire into their Methods, hoping for the like success; and so they <HI>teach the wicked ones their ways,</HI> Jer. 2. 33. (2.) <HI>By their Influence;</HI> accor∣ding to the extent thereof; <HI>Covetous men</HI> will make a prey of the careless, foolish and ignorant; but will make use of the crafty, as tools to serve their▪

design; they therefore enquire after such as are <HI>subtil,</HI> but <HI>indigent;</HI> these must be disposed into seve∣ral <HI>Under-Offices,</HI> in <HI>divers Stations;</HI> now these poor Cretuers are often under cruel Bondage; they have their Debts to pay, their Families to maintain, and a proportion to pay unto their <HI>Employers.</HI> What course must they take? To complain of their <HI>hard Terms,</HI> is to lose their <HI>Livelihood;</HI> to <HI>disclose the Intreague,</HI> is the way to <HI>ruin;</HI> the only way is to <HI>grind the faces of the poor,</HI> to use artifices to filch from the Publick; and by such methods, <HI>Poverty comes on a people like an armed man;</HI> they hardly know whence the mis∣chief doth arise; only they find themselves in a <HI>deep Consumption,</HI> past cure. So pernicious, hurtful and destructive are <HI>Covetous men to the Publick In∣terest.</HI></P>
<P>Inasmuch as my design in treating on this Sub∣ject, was in a peculiar manner, for the Service of this Town. I shall in the Application humbly of∣fer my Advice in three particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us be very thankful for the Priviledges we Enjoy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us highly prize and value them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Manifest that value, by Chusing men hating Co∣vetousness, to the several Offices at your dispose.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Adv.</HI> 1. Let this Town be very thankful for the <HI>Mercies</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> it doth yet enjoy, through the favour of our <HI>Gracious God.</HI> When we consider the many provoking Evils that have been, &amp; still are in it; we must acknowledge, <HI>that it is of the Lords mercies that we are not consumed.</HI> This Town is a monument of the <HI>patience, forbearance</HI> &amp; <HI>long∣suffering</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="001448_0025_0FB2F3B46B7415A0"/>
of God: it had been consumed and laid in Ashes, had not the tender mercies of God prevent∣ed; <HI>Many a time may we now say, had not God been on our side, the Enemy would have swallowed us up quick; the proud waters had gone over our Soul; but blessed be God, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth: Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers, the snare is broken, and we are escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made Hea∣ven and earth,</HI> Psal. 124. Let us consider, very ma∣ny Towns, Cities and Strong Holds (the Master∣pieces of Art) have been shattered, beaten down, consumed by fire, plundered and ravaged, during the long War; and yet this Town preserved; <HI>no Gally with Oars, nor Gallant Ship hath shot a Bullet, nor Bomb against it; this is the doing of the Lord, &amp; it ought to be marvellous in our eyes;</HI> we ought to <HI>call upon our Souls, and all within us to sing praises to God, sing praises, for he hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad,</HI> and <HI>Blessed be his glorious name.</HI> But we are not only <HI>preserved; we enjoy many mer∣cies, we are daily loaden with benefits,</HI> we have a <HI>great measure of health, peace and plenty,</HI> while others are consumed by the <HI>Sword, Famine,</HI> &amp; <HI>Pestilence;</HI> the <HI>Lord dealeth bountifully with us.</HI> To all this. (1.) We enjoy our <HI>Sacred Priviledges;</HI> we have liberty to <HI>Worship God</HI> on his <HI>Holy Day,</HI> in the ways of his <HI>own Appointment, and none make us afraid.</HI> We have <HI>faithful Ministers,</HI> instructing us in the great <HI>Myste∣ries of the Gospel,</HI> in the things that <HI>concern our peace; Watchmen upon our walls,</HI> to warn us of our danger, and calling us to <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation:
<PB N="27" REF="001448_0026_0FB2F3B60CB23A98"/>
Watchmen</HI> that Pray for our Welfare, saying as <HI>Isa.</HI> 122. 7. <HI>Peace be within thy walls, prosperity within thy palaces; for my brethren and companions sake, I will now say, peace be within thee; because of the House of the Lord our God, I will seek thy good.</HI> Let us consider, the many famous Churches, which have been broken and dispersed, there is <HI>none to break the Bread of Life to them,</HI> there is a <HI>Famine, not of Bread, but of hearing the Word of the Lord; they wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North even to the East, they run to and fro to seek the Word of the Lord, and cannot find it, Amos</HI> 8. There are many of the precious Sons of <HI>Zion</HI> murthered in the most barbarous manner? Many in <HI>Dungeons</HI> and <HI>Gallys;</HI> and many dispersed into the several Quarters of the Earth, and their Children brought up in <HI>Popish Ido∣latry;</HI> and we have a full Enjoyment of <HI>precious ad∣vantages,</HI> though so <HI>barren</HI> &amp; <HI>unfruitful</HI> under them: It is from rich and glorious Grace; let us <HI>remember whence we are fallen, repent and do our first works.</HI> We have large <HI>Civil Liberties.</HI> It is a great favour, that there are so many of the Children of the Town (as well as others) who seek the Good thereof, &amp; that are well-qualified for <HI>Publick Service</HI> in divers Stations; and that the Town hath liberty to Chuse such into Office. Let us consider many there are who once had very great priviledges of this sort▪ but they have been wrested out of their hands by force, or stollen from them by cunning artifices; they are now but <HI>Vassals,</HI> daily exposed as a prey to hungry, greedy, savage <HI>Officers,</HI> who oppress them in all their Interests; all <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> is ta∣ken

away; or at least is so <HI>precarious;</HI> that they can hardly say a <HI>Foot of Land,</HI> or any of <HI>their Goods are their own.</HI> But blessed be the Lord our God, who hath freed us from such <HI>Oppressors.</HI> And let us not forget to be thankful <HI>for the QUEENS most Ex∣cellent Majesty, daily Praying for Her long Life and Prosperity,</HI> under whose <HI>Influence we Enjoy such preci∣ous advantages.</HI></P>
<P>Adv. 2. <HI>Let us prize and value our Priviledges, &amp; not at a low rate, but as a rich Inheritance.</HI> As the <HI>Constitution of the English Government, is justly esteem∣ed the most excellent in the Earth;</HI> the Priviledges of <HI>English</HI> men the greatest; so it hath cost much <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Treasure</HI> to secure them from <HI>Generation to Generation.</HI> The Glorious God hath marvellously <HI>preserved them;</HI> and shall we <HI>disregard them? What home-born Slaves shall we deserve to be, if we do not value them.</HI> They ought to be treated with indig∣nation, who would perswade <HI>poor people</HI> they are <HI>little worth:</HI> they intend to make their market of them, and are like those crafty Traders mention∣ed, Prov. 20. 14. <HI>It is naught, it is naught saith the Buyer, but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth;</HI> and so will these triumph over those whom they impose upon.</P>
<P>Adv. 2. <HI>Manifest your value for your</HI> Priviledges▪ <HI>by Chusing men hating Covetousness into all such</HI> Pub∣lick Offices <HI>and</HI> Stations <HI>as are at your dispose.</HI> Con∣sider, (1.) <HI>There is no security for any</HI> Priviledge <HI>or</HI> Trust <HI>committed to a Covetous man:</HI> They are usu∣ally timorous and fearful, they are Flatterers and Time servers; and their greediness after Riches,

will influence them to accept <HI>a good profer</HI> when presen∣ted by them that know how to make the <HI>advantage.</HI> It is impossible to conceive the <HI>mischiefs</HI> done by the <HI>Co∣vetous.</HI> How many <HI>Cities, Towns,</HI> &amp; <HI>Countreys</HI> have been <HI>bought</HI> &amp; <HI>sold</HI> by the <HI>Covetous.</HI> Whence had the <HI>French</HI> their Glory? but by <HI>Pensioners</HI> in the several <HI>Neighbour∣ing Countreys,</HI> who exposed Priviledges to Sale where∣by he had the opportunity <HI>to seize the Effects? And is not this one great end of this long and expen∣sive War,</HI> (which <HI>hath cost many millions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> measure; and hundreds of thousand Lives</HI>) to make him <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efund</HI> which he <HI>purchased so clandestinely?</HI> (2.) <HI>Men hating Covetousness will do much Service:</HI> I intend not this <HI>Qualification▪ ex∣clusive of others,</HI> but in conjunction; even <HI>able men, men fearing God, men of Truth, hating Covetousness;</HI> this <HI>Generous principle,</HI> will dispose them to employ all their <HI>Talents St. Interests</HI> to <HI>Serve the Publick.</HI> They will have a <HI>watch∣ful eye over the Covetous,</HI> they <HI>know their narrow selfish souls are always contriving</HI> by <HI>subtil artifices to gull the Publick; and therefore will endeavour to prevent them.</HI> Whereas the <HI>Publick Good</HI> lying near <HI>the hearts</HI> of these, they will be always <HI>projecting</HI> and <HI>contriving</HI> something to promote it, viz. <HI>To reform the Manners of the Town;</HI> To <HI>prevent Nusances,</HI> &amp; <HI>Inconveniencies;</HI> to <HI>strengthen</HI> &amp; <HI>defend it▪ to regulate, and increase the Trade of it;</HI> to <HI>relieve</HI> &amp; <HI>sup∣ply the poor;</HI> &amp; <HI>to punish the disorderly, as far as their pow∣er extends.</HI> And besides all this, will be examples of a <HI>ready, chearful Contribution</HI> of <HI>their proportion</HI> to the <HI>Pub∣lick Charge.</HI> (3.) <HI>Men hating Covetousness will not only do most Service for the Publick, but with least expence.</HI> Here we may observe, (1.) There are indeed <HI>divers Offices in the Town,</HI> which <HI>Qualified men</HI> ought to <HI>attend</HI> out of pure regard to the <HI>publick Good;</HI> as <HI>Members of the Body Politick;</HI> without expecting a <HI>Salary: Men hating Cove∣tousness</HI> will serve the <HI>Town</HI> in such <HI>Capacities, readily, chearfully and impartially;</HI> and ought to be treated with Respect, loved and valued for their Fidelity. It is la∣mentable
<PB N="30" REF="001448_0029_0FB2F3BD0CD055A0"/>
to consider what <HI>ill-usage</HI> such have sometimes met with. (2.) There are other <HI>Officers in the Town,</HI> who justly <HI>expect a Support suitable to their Stations and Work.</HI> I advise <HI>to Chuse men hating Covetousness into such Stations and Employments;</HI> On this Account, that they <HI>will do most good, with least Charge;</HI> which will appear, if we consider, (1.) <HI>That those who Chuse Per∣sons into Publick Offices, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, ought to provide for their Subsistance to such a degree, that they may diligently and chearfully attend on that Ser∣vice to which they call them;</HI> this is <HI>their due</HI> by the <HI>Lams of God as I Man;</HI> to <HI>deny</HI> or <HI>with-hold it,</HI> is to contradict one of the first <HI>dictates of the Law of Na∣ture;</HI> therefore such may and ought to expect it, and depend upon it. (2.) <HI>Men hating Covetousness will be content with a competency;</HI> there is a bound and limit to their desires in this respect: <HI>As they pray, that God would feed them with food convenient,</HI> so they <HI>expect no more from man,</HI> but what is suitable to their Station, and Circumstance. But here I must observe, that for this their temper, they are often <HI>horribly abused,</HI> and <HI>neglected; for which God will judge.</HI> (3.) But then Consider, <HI>If covetous, greedy men be put into such Stati∣ons, what will follow:</HI> They will thus argue, There is a suitable supply for the support of <HI>me</HI> and <HI>mine,</HI> due to me by all Laws, Divine and Humane; If I <HI>provide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for my own, especially for those of my own house, I deny the faith,</HI> h. e. <HI>The Christian Faith, and an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than an Infidel.</HI> I have no other way to subsist while I live, nor Leave to mine when I Die. These people deny me what is just and equal; it is not for want, they have enough, they have plen∣ty: I see it in their costly and extravagant Garbs, their stately Fabricks, their rich Furniture; in their Shops, Ships, in their Fields &amp; Barns: Therefore ha∣ving an opportunity in my hand, I will improve

it, and employ all the <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Agents</HI> I can, to get that which they unjustly detain from me. And thus often-times <HI>Covetous men</HI> squeese more Treasure from them, than would support many others; and they have no remedy; but may set down bewailing their folly, in <HI>with∣holding more than was meet.</HI> I beseech you to consider what mischief <HI>Covetous men</HI> may do in their several Offices and Stations; some by <HI>false En∣tries,</HI> defacing, or altering of <HI>Records;</HI> by wasting of <HI>Treasure;</HI> by unjust <HI>Rates,</HI> and cruel <HI>Exactions,</HI> by denying to <HI>Vote,</HI> or selling of <HI>Votes;</HI> and by innumerable methods, and subtil devices; and you will perceive they are <HI>dangerous men,</HI> and to be a∣voided; they are often (as we term them) <HI>sober men,</HI> and nothing to be objected, save only in the matter of <HI>Covetousness▪</HI> they will pretend to save Charges, but are on all men most profuse and la∣vish, will lose opportunities for doing of Service, and part with rich advantages for the <HI>Publick,</HI> ra∣ther than stay a few hours from their own Inte∣rest. I Conclude with one Consideration more, which would afford matter for a long Discourse▪ <HI>Viz.</HI> To shew what mischief <HI>Covetous men</HI> do in Churches. <HI>Where Church-Officers are greedy of fil∣thy lucre,</HI> and the Body of the Community <HI>Le∣vened</HI> with the same evil; there is nothing se∣cure where <HI>Covetousness</HI> reigns. If <HI>Church-Rulers</HI> are <HI>Covetous,</HI> they will fawn, flatter,▪ and com∣ply with the lusts of men; <HI>having their persons in admiration for an advantage, &amp;c.</HI> If the Peo∣ple are <HI>Covetous,</HI> they will expose the <HI>Officers</HI> to
<PB N="32" REF="001448_0031_0FB2F3C12D535908"/>
innumerable difficulties and temptations; divert them from their Duty, or so clog them; that as dispirited and discouraged men will do little or no Service! It is so contrary to the Gospel, that those who are under the power of it, are excluded from the Priviledges of it. <HI>If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him:</HI> Such Profes∣sors are <HI>Spots</HI> and <HI>Blemishes; they grieve the Holy, Spirit of God, quench his motions, and cause him to depart from that people; and provoke the Holy One to give them up to strong delusions.</HI></P>
<P>Having been thus helped to leave a plain <HI>Testi∣mony against Covetousness;</HI> through Grace I will a∣bide thereby; leaving it to the Blessing of God; and recommend the Advice of our Lord Jesus; Luke 12. 15. <HI>Take heed, and beware of Covetous∣ness.</HI></P>
