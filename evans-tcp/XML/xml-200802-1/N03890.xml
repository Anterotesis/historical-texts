<HEAD>A short Account of the LIBRARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Library-Company was form'd in 1731, by Constitutions or Ar∣ticles entred into by 50 Persons, each obliging himself to pay 40 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for purchasing the first Parcel of Books, and 10 <HI>s. per annum</HI> to defray Charges and encrease the Library.</P>

<P>Any Member may borrow a Book for 2, 3, or 4 Weeks, leaving his Note for double Value, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> paying a small Penalty if 'tis not return'd at the Time agreed; which Penalties are applied to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Charges, or pur∣chasing more Books.</P>
