<HEAD>SERMON I. The Obligation of Justice, and its Importance to the Happi∣ness of a People.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH V.7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And He looked for Judgment, but behold Oppression; for Righteousness, but behold a Cry.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is part of the explanation and application of a very pertinent and instructive parable; wherein, under the similitude of a vineyard, the divine tenderness and care, and <HI>Israel</HI>'s un∣fruitfulness and danger, are plainly pointed out. <HI>My welbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: And he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah judge I pray you be∣twixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it?
<PB N="6" REF="013278_0004_0F8FB8CC2BAD4640"/>
Wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? and now, go to I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up: And break down the wall thereof and it shall be trod∣den down. And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it:</HI> As from the first to the fifth verse.</P>
<P>From this representation it appears, that God's an∣cient people were most highly privileged; that they had all the means of temporal and spiritual prosperity in their hands; yet that they misimproved and per∣verted them; were ungrateful and disobedient, and thereby provoked God to withdraw his special pro∣tection from them, and leave them exposed to wasting calamities.—That they need not fail of understanding the parable, and applying it to themselves, the prophet adds, as in the verse of which our text is part; <HI>For the vineyard of the Lord of bosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: And he look∣ed for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteous∣ness, but behold a cry.</HI></P>
<P>The words thus connected and introduced, evident∣ly supply us with these three topicks of discourse, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteousness, are what God expects and de∣mands from a people. Nevertheless,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. They are sometimes so degenerate as, instead of judgment, to be guilty of oppression; and instead of righteousness, to occasion a cry.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="7" REF="013278_0005_0F904A029715CA40"/>III. When this is the case with a people, he may justly leave them to the fatal consequences of their folly and wickedness, or send other distressing judgments among them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteousness, are what God expects and demands from a people. <HI>He looked for judgment—and for righ∣teousness.</HI> God had done so much for his people <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> both in an ordinary and extraordinary way, that he had all the reason in the world (speaking after the manner of men) to expect that they should be a righ∣teous and holy people. God, indeed, has just reason to expect an observance of the laws of righteousness from every society of rational creatures, and from every individual, so far as those laws may be known. And the greater advantages any person or people have to know and observe those laws, the greater is their ob∣ligation to observe them.—But this point may be il∣lustrated by the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteousness are what God expects and demands from a people, may be argued from the nature and constitution of man. God manifests his will by the operations of his hands, as well as by the dictates of his word. Mankind in general shew the work of the law written in their hearts; particularly the law of justice and equity. We are born with a sense of right and wrong, which grows quicker and stronger, as we advance in age, unless weakened, corrupted and over∣borne by education and example. There is a princi∣ple within us that approves of the practice of righte∣ousness, and condemns wrong and injustice. Even sa∣vage nations retain this sense, and have rules among
<PB N="8" REF="013278_0006_0F904A02B7B6D140"/>
them of equitable dealing. And though there are some that live by plundering and robbing their neighbours, yet they do not like to be plundered and robbed them∣selves, but retain amongst one another the practice of justice. Now, such being the impressions made on the hearts of men by the hand of their Creator, it is plain that he requires them to preserve these impressi∣ons; to do nothing to obliterate them; to square their conduct by them; that being upright and honest in their dealings, they may answer God's reasonable ex∣pectations from them, by promoting the general order and felicity of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we consider the moral character of the deity, as being a lover of righteousness, and hater of iniquity, and the precepts and prohibitions he has published, we cannot but conclude, that the execution of judgment and the practice righteousness, are what God justly ex∣pects and demands from a people. Our natural no∣tions of God will not allow us to think of him as any other than an all perfect, and consequently, as an in∣finitely holy and righteous being: As one, who will do no wrong to any of his creatures; but, in all his transactions with them, will observe the strictest equity. To besure, this is the idea which revelation every where conveys of the divine nature and conduct. He is there stiled, <HI>the just God, the righteous Lord,</HI> &amp;c. And as to his dealing, we are assured, that <HI>the judge of all the earth will do right</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii.25.</NOTE> that <HI>he is excellent in judgment and in plenty of justice</HI>; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job xxvii.23.</NOTE> that <HI>he will not lay upon man more than right</HI>; <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Job xxiv.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> that <HI>he is no respecter of persons; but in every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness, is accepted of
<PB N="9" REF="013278_0007_0F904A0383CC7D08"/>
him.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts x.34, 35.</NOTE> This being the character of God, it is evident that he must delight in such a character; and that the opposite to this, in any of his creatures, is dis∣pleasing to him. Hence we read that <HI>the righteous Lord loveth righteousness, and his countenance be∣holdeth the upright: To do judgment and justice is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxi.3.</NOTE> And the laws both of the old and new testament require strict justice between man and man. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, execute ye judgment and righteousness. In all your labors let none iniquity be found in you.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxii.3.</NOTE> These commands are enforced by promises to the righteous, and threatnings to the unjust. <HI>If a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right; hath not oppressed any; hath restored to the debtor his pledge; hath spoiled none by violence; hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, and executed true judgment between man and man; he shall surely live saith the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xviii.5, 7.8.</NOTE> But on the other hand, <HI>He that doth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done; his reward shall return upon his own head</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Col. iii 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Know ye not that the un∣righteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?</HI><NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> It is particularly to be observed how greatly the God of ju∣stice detests, and how strongly he prohibits, that par∣ticular species of unrighteousness, called <HI>oppression</HI>; which in my text is opposed to judgment. <HI>Ye shall not oppress one another.</HI><NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">Lev. xxv.14.</NOTE> <HI>If thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent perverting of judgment and ju∣stice in the earth, marvel not at the matter; for he that is higher than the highest regardeth, and there be higher than they.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Eccl. v.8.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="013278_0008_0F904A0440EE20F0"/>These precepts and prohibitions respecting the pract∣ice of righteousness and judgment, are obligatory up∣on every individual of a community from the highest ruler down to the lowest subject. Every person, how mean soever in himself, is intitled to justice, and no one has a right to injure him. The laws of every commu∣nity should be so framed, as to secure the rights of the whole; and protect the person and property of every individual, and to restrain and punish all acts of vio∣lence and injustice. For, though by being members of society, some part of our natural liberty is given up; yet not so much of it is given up, as that any other member, or members of society, how great soever, may lawfully enslave us, or deprive us of our property, we remaining innocent. Our persons and earnings are our own; and we have a right to the unmolested enjoy∣ment of them; yea, we ought to be protected in the enjoyment of them, so long as we remain the peace∣able members of the community. It is incumbent on legislators to contrive and enact the most equitable laws; such as are most conducive to the security and prosperity of the state. And when such laws are or∣dained, justice requires that they should be observed. No individual, not the King himself, is above law, or has liberty to go contrary to, or beside the constitution of the kingdom. The king of heaven <HI>exerciseth judg∣ment and righteousness in the earth, and deligheth,</HI> and commandeth the kings of the earth to imitate him <HI>therein.</HI> The highest human potentate has not the least power or permission, by the laws of nature or re∣velation, to do wrong, to pervert judgment and ju∣stice, or to injure the meanest of his subjects. The rules of righteousness and equity are the rules of <HI>his</HI> conduct, as well as of others. The safety and advan∣tage
<PB N="11" REF="013278_0009_0F904A051C301850"/>
of the people is the supreme law by which the prince, and all subordinate magistrates should govern themselves; the highest point at which they should aim.</P>
<P>An inspired king, and the wisest of the sons of men says, <HI>Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxv.5.</NOTE> When the throne is established in righteousness, every edict that proceeds from it will be mild, where mildness will answer the end: And where severity is necessary, still the laws of justice and equity will not be violated. <HI>Justice and judgment are the habitation of God's throne:</HI> And this is a model for earthly kings. Punishment is God's <HI>strange work</HI>; and it should be equally the <HI>strange work</HI> of princes and magistrates. Punishment should never be inflicted, but when the safety and be∣nefit of the community require it; never, to gratify the resentment and revenge of a prince, or his coun∣sellors; never, to awe and intimidate to unworthy sub∣missions. And if light and gentle corrections will an∣swer the end, heavier should never be made use of.</P>
<P>As it is the business of legislators to enact the most equitable laws, so it is the part of executive officers to see that such laws are obeyed. And if they are just magistrates, actuated by a principle of righteousness and equity, or a regard to the people's interest, they will avoid every thing that will frustrate the attainment of this end. Those that sit on the tribunal, will hold the balances of justice with an equal and impartial hand. In their decisions between man and man, they will pro∣nounce uprightly, without respect of persons. And
<PB N="12" REF="013278_0010_0F904A05C2A31068"/>
when they <HI>sit to judge men after the law, they will not command them to be smitten contrary to the law.</HI> They will observe the charge that was given by <HI>Moses</HI> to the judges of <HI>Israel: Hear the causes between your bre∣thren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but you shall hear the small as well as the great: You shall not be afraid of the face of a man, for the judgment is God's.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut i.16, 17.</NOTE> They will therefore avoid every thing that will tend to byass their judgment. They will <HI>shake their hands from holding of bribes.</HI> They will choose to be in such a si∣tuation and circumstances as will have their minds free and independent; and to receive their support from that quarter which will be least likely to influence their decisions. <HI>So much</HI> is dependant on the sentence of judges; so much of the peace and welfare of society, and the secure enjoyment or recovery of what is our own, that the greatest care ought to be taken by <HI>those</HI> who appoint them and the means and manner of their support, and by <HI>themselves</HI> in hearing and determining causes, that their minds and the fountain of justice may be preserved uncorrupt; lest the words of the wise man be again verified, and too applicable to modern judicatures: <HI>I saw under the sun, the place of judg∣ment, that wickeaness was there, and the place of righ∣teousness, that iniquity was there.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eccl. iii.16.</NOTE> And it is pro∣bable that this is the reason (viz, "because so much of the peace and welfare of a people, and their secure enjoyment or recovery of what is their own, depends so much on the unbyassed sentence of judges," that this is the reason) why the word <HI>judgment,</HI> which is properly the sentence or decision of a judge, is so of∣ten,
<PB N="13" REF="013278_0011_0F8FB8CCF866F318"/>
in scripture, put for the practice of justice and e∣quity in general.</P>
<P>But God not only <HI>looketh for judgment</HI> from prin∣ces and magistrates, but for <HI>righteousness</HI> also from the common people. In all their commerce with one a∣nother, justice and equity should be their invariable standard. They must never go beyond, nor defraud one another in their dealings; never injure another in his person, property, or good name. In all their com∣merce with their fellow men, they must observe the golden rule, <HI>Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. vii.12.</NOTE> It argues a corrupt and dishonest mind, for any to expect the exercise of justice in others towards themselves, and to practise in∣justice themselves towards others. 'Tis absurd and wicked for any to conduct as if righteousness and judg∣ment belonged only to rulers and judges, or were con∣fined only to courts of judicature, or became obliga∣tory only in consequence of human laws. To refrain from injuring and wronging another; to pay every one his due; to treat every one with that tenderness, respect and deference, which his particular station, cha∣racter and merit demand, are duties which primarily result not from the laws of man, but from the laws of nature which are the laws of God. They are duties in all ages and nations, under all forms of government, and even where human establishments were never framed. Therefore, to withhold from another his just right, or to offer him any injury, because there is no human authority to oblige him to pay the one, or to punish him for offering the other, is dishonest and un∣just. The rules of righteousness oblige people to <HI>ren∣der to all their dues; tribute, to whom tribute is due; custom, to whom custom; fear, to whom fear; honor,
<PB N="14" REF="013278_0012_0F904A06702DDCC0"/>
to whom honor; and to owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii.7, 8.</NOTE> They should never <HI>curse the king, no not in their thought</HI>; never <HI>speak evil of dignities</HI>; never <HI>revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of the peo∣ple</HI>; never <HI>resist those powers which are ordained of God</HI>; to be <HI>ministers to them for good,</HI> and who answer the end of their appointment. On the contrary, they should put up <HI>supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority, that they may lead quiet and peacea∣ble lives in all godliness and honesty.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii.1, 2.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. That the execution of judgment, and the pract∣ice of righteousness are what God expects and demands from a people, may be argued from the tendency of those virtues to the happiness of a people, and the con∣trary tendency of oppression and injustice.</P>
<P>It is evident from the constitution of man; from the furniture of his mind and the disposition of his heart; from the chain of love which runs through the whole, and links man to man, and forms them into societies; from the bountiful provision that is made throughout the creation, for their accommodation, defence, and pleasure; from all these things, as well as from reve∣lation, it is evident, that the father of the universe, the great head of the social system, consults the good and happiness of human society, and that he would have all the members of it do the same. And he hath pre∣scribed such a system of laws, as, if duly observed, <HI>will</HI> promote the interest of the whole. Whatever tends to build up a society upon a virtuous foundation, and to increase its opulence and strength, <HI>that,</HI> God would
<PB N="15" REF="013278_0013_0F8FB8CE61D03448"/>
have the members of it pursue; and whatever would have an opposite effect, <HI>that</HI> he would have them a∣void: Consequently he would have a people pursue the paths of judgment and righteousness, which are the paths of peace and prosperity: And to shun the road of oppression and violence, as this is the road to unhappiness and ruin. <HI>Righteousness exalteth a nation,</HI> says the wise man, <HI>but sin is a reproach to any people.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov; xiv.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE></P>
<P>When a people are all righteous; when the rules of equity and justice are heartily loved and practised by all ranks of men, things must go well in the midst of them. If kings, governors, and all subordinate magistrates and rulers, are influenced by principles of integrity, how greatly conducive are they to the hap∣piness of their subjects, and their own? They will not, in this case, frame any laws but what tend to the pub∣lic good. They will endeavor that "the advantages of the constitution and of the laws, may extend to eve∣ry branch, and to each individual in society, of what∣ever degree; that every man may enjoy his property, and pursue his honest course of life with security. Such rulers will attend to the operation of their own acts, and will repeal whatever laws, upon an impartial review, they find to be inconsistent with the laws of God, with the rights of men, and the general benefits of saints. Stability in promoting the public good, leads to a change of measures, when the interest of a community requires it, which must often be the case in this mutable, im∣perfect state." It must be evident that such a con∣duct in rulers (an invariable regard to the rules of e∣quity and justice) must have a most direct tendency to
<PB N="16" REF="013278_0014_0F904A075A133F48"/>
the happiness of a people, and to their own honor, ease and interest, in both worlds. As to themselves, such an upright conduct will afford them the most peace∣ful and joyous reflections, and a heart-felt pleasure, in∣finitely superior to any that can be administred by the servile flatterer. Yea, they will be able to appeal to God in the language of governor <HI>Nehemiah, Think upon me my GOD for good, according to all that I have done for this people</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neh. v.19.</NOTE> or in that of king <HI>Hezekiah, Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in thy sight</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xx 3.</NOTE> Pious king <HI>David,</HI> in some of his <HI>last words,</HI> lays down what is essential in the character of a good ruler, and then immediately subjoins what will be the benign, the happy effect of such an one's administration: The character is this, <HI>He that ruleth over men, must be just, ruling in the fear of GOD.</HI> His kindly influence upon the people will be, <HI>as the light of the morning when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds: As the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxiii.3, 4</NOTE></P>
<P>If rulers are pious towards GOD, and benevolent and just towards men, it will have a happy and most di∣rect tendency to transfuse a spirit of piety, benevolence and justice through the body of the people. Exam∣ple is very influential, especially in superiors. The lower classes of mankind look up to those above them for patterns of behavior as well as dress; and easily slide into the imitation of those whom they consider as their betters. Happy would it be for people, if they always found in the higher classes, examples of piety and justice suitable to be followed! Pious rulers,
<PB N="17" REF="013278_0015_0F904A0829E19690"/>
like pious ministers, are the lights of the world, diffu∣sing a benign influence all around, attracting regard, and inviting imitation.</P>
<P>And when people in general follow after righteous∣ness, charity and godliness; when <HI>judgment runs down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream,</HI> how great must be their security and prosperity! When iniquity stoppeth her mouth, and justice has a free course among all orders of men, the body politic will feel easy and free, healthy and joyous. There will be no complaints of injustice and violence, of tyranny and oppression, of anarchy and disobedience. <HI>No man will seek his own, but every man another's wealth</HI> and pros∣perity. As christians, they will <HI>study the things which make for peace, and the things wherewith one may edify</HI> and benefit <HI>another.</HI> Neighborhoods, towns and pro∣vinces will live in the peaceable enjoyment of life, li∣berty and property; <HI>every one sitting under his own vine and figtree, and none making him afraid.</HI> They will eat the fruit of their own labor, dwell in the land securely, see the good of God's chosen, and rejoice in the gladness of his nation. All <HI>their officers being peace, and their exactors righteousness, violence and spoil shall no more be heard in their land, wasting and destruction within their borders; but they shall call their walls salvation, and their gates praise.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. lx.17, 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>And if it should at any time happen, through the necessary imperfection of the greatest and best minds, that some grievances took place; a people having such rulers as were actuated by principles of integrity, would not be greatly depressed, having confidence, that their
<PB N="18" REF="013278_0016_0F904A0A9D8D1810"/>
complaints would be patiently heard, their just petiti∣ons granted, and every unnecessary burden removed. The innocent would have no cause to fear being pu∣nished with the guilty; but on the contrary, would be supported and protected in their just rights. And where controversies were to be settled by the decision of magistrates and judges, how happy must the parties be, from a confidence, that the courts of judicature were constitutional and uncorrupt; that they could obtain a fair trial; that judges and jurors were upright and impartial, and under no undue influence to favor one more than another; that they would determine with wisdom, and <HI>judge righteous judgment?</HI></P>
<P>But let us reverse all this goodly scene, and what disorder, tumult, and infelicity will ensue? How mi∣serable will a people be, where, instead of <HI>judgment,</HI> we behold <HI>oppression</HI>; and instead of <HI>righteousness,</HI> we hear a <HI>cry?</HI> If a king does not rule in righteousness, his sub∣jects will, in many instances, have their rights and li∣berties, and perhaps their lives, endangered, if not de∣stroyed. They will not be able to depend on his pro∣mises and engagements; they will be liable to be de∣prived of their charter rights though they have not forfeited them.—The wise man says, <HI>if a ruler hear∣ken to lies, all his servants are wicked.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxix.12.</NOTE> If a prince is disposed to be just, yet if his counsellors are not ac∣tuated by the same principle, they will obstruct the free course of justice, and occasion much wrong and inju∣ry. They will not make the public good, but some selfish passion their end of governing, and the consti∣tution itself will be in danger. And <HI>if the foundations be destroyed, what shall the righteoue do?</HI> If avaricious
<PB N="19" REF="013278_0017_0F904A0AF55175B8"/>
men are in authority, they will be disposed to sacrifice the public, to their own private interest. "Terrible are the effects of this corrupt passion, when rulers are venal, and justice itself is bought and sold." If ambi∣tion be their leading principle, every thing else, even liberty itself, and the most sacred rights, must give way thereto. If their tempers are naturally severe, they will "incline to write their laws in blood; which will keep a society unquiet, and be apt to approach the verge of tyranny." And where men of arbitrary principles are at the helm, they will "dispose of liber∣ty, property and life, in spite of the most venerable rights descended from distant ages; in spite of the voice of reason, the maxims of equity, and the claims of conscience.—No justice restrains; no mercy re∣lents." The cries of the oppressed, are unheard and unpitied; the needy and the fatherless are crushed in the gates. "Does any one dispute or lift up his hand, fire comes out of the bramble, and destroys the cedars of <HI>Lebanon.</HI>" In fine, where the selfish passions are predominant, in those that govern, honor and consci∣ence will be but slender restraints from oppression and wrong; and if places of honor and profit can be se∣cured to themselves and families, no matter what is sacrificed in attaining them; not even the freedom of their country, or the rights of their countrymen shall be regarded.</P>
<P>And if those who are in executive authority are un∣faithful, partial, and corrupt, what injustice and misery will be likely to happen amongst the people? If judges are appointed, and rewarded, and kept in place, not during, or according to good behavior, but solely at the will of the prince; yea, if jurors, and every other
<PB N="20" REF="013278_0018_0F904A0D54FD0048"/>
officer concerned in trying causes, and executing the laws, be wholly on the side of the king, by virtue of their appointment, is there not danger of justice being perverted, and the subject greatly injured as to his li∣berty, estate, and person?

<P>And if the body of the people catch the infection; or rather if the malignity of their hearts shou'd break out, the restraints of law and authority being weaken∣ed, how much distress and wretchedness will they oc∣casion to one another? Provoked at the vast stretches of arbitrary power which they see in their rulers, and not being sufficiently swayed by a principle of justice themselves, they will be in danger of opposing lawful authority; of destroying all distinction and subordina∣tion among men; of weakening, or rendering useless the laws; of contemning all government; of putting forth their hands to their neighbours damage or de∣struction; or by some other rash proceedings, preci∣pitating the ruin they were endeavoring to avoid.</P>
<P>If people are not influenced by a principle of honesty and integrity, in their conduct towards one another, they will create amongst themselves the greatest vex∣ation and calamity.

<HEAD>SERMON II. The Nature and Danger of Op∣pression, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH V. 7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And He looked for Judgment, but behold Oppression: for Righteousness, but behold a Cry.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM these words we observed, in the forenoon, the following things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the execution of judgment, and the pract∣ice of righteousness are what God expects and de∣mands from a people. Nevertheless,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. They are sometimes so degenerate, as, instead of judgment, to be guilty of oppression; and, in∣stead of righteousness, to occasion a cry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. When this is the case with a people, he may justly leave them to the fatal consequences of their folly and wickedness, or send other distress∣ing judgments among them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="23" REF="013278_0021_0F904A127523B6C8"/>The first of these only, has been considered; and I now proceed to the <HI>second,</HI> viz.</P>
<P N="2">II. That notwithstanding God's just expectations from a people, they are sometimes so degenerate as, instead of judgment, to be guilty of oppression; and instead of righteousness to occasion a cry.</P>
<P>Humanly speaking, God was greatly disappointed in his expectations from his ancient people the <HI>Jews.</HI> He appeals to them, and to all the world, that he had done every thing to make them a righteous and pros∣perous nation. But they had frustrated the end, by perverting the means. <HI>What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Where∣fore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</HI></P>
<P>But other people, as well as <HI>Israel,</HI> decline from the right way, become corrupt and immoral; are guilty of impiety towards God, and unrighteous dealing to∣wards one another. <HI>Oppression</HI> is found, and the <HI>cries</HI> of the injured are heard, in the midst of them.</P>
<P><HI>Oppression</HI> seems, in my text, to be opposed to <HI>judg∣ment,</HI> and a <HI>cry</HI> to <HI>righteousness.</HI> As <HI>judgment</HI> is more especially the duty of magistrates, <HI>so oppression</HI> is more generally their sin: Though neither the one, nor the other, is wholly confined to them. For <HI>judgment</HI> often comprehends a duty or duties which the common peo∣ple owe to one another; and it is certain that the com∣mon people can be guilty of <HI>oppression.</HI> As to the practice of <HI>righteousness,</HI> it is incumbent on all men to∣wards all, whether they be high or low, rich or poor; superiors, inferiors, or equals. And acts of injustice
<PB N="24" REF="013278_0022_0F904A1334545CC0"/>
may occasion a <HI>try,</HI> whether the wrong proceed from a ruler or subject; whether it be occasioned by an op∣pressive use of power, or by trespass and dishonesty in common dealings. By <HI>cry</HI> in this place, we are to un∣derstand the complaint of the injured and oppressed. 'Tis a token of distress; and the word is often made use of to denote the exclamation of those who think themselves abused. <HI>They cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiv.28.</NOTE> <HI>They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">xxxv <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> <HI>Be∣hold the hire of the laborers, which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped, have entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Jam. x <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE></P>
<P>Here we may make a few brief observations.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is natural for the injured to complain. All the passions and sensations of nature, have particular ways of expressing themselves: And these expressions being natural, are universally felt and understood. External injuries, which occasion bodily pains, cause groans and cries, which are the calls of nature for pity and relief. But keener pain and distress may be felt in the mind from the ill treatment we meet with from our fellow∣men; a pain from grief, anger and other passions in∣termixt. And it is not more natural for a child to cry when it is hurt, than it is for these inward sensations to vent themselves in some way of complaining. When any act of injustice is practised upon us, we feel ourselves injured, we feel ourselves imposed on and dishonored; and we cannot help feeling our resentments kindle, our anger rise, and our grief excited, to find any of our
<PB N="25" REF="013278_0023_0F904A13EF7838C0"/>
fellow-creatures discovering such a base temper, and that we are the objects upon whom they practise it. Sometimes, when the injury is great or long continu∣ed, we feel the workings of revenge: We vent our passions in bitter language, in threats, if not in execra∣tions; (for the passions are apt to be extravagant, and <HI>oppression will make a wise man mad</HI>) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. vii.7.</NOTE> we utter our complaints <HI>of</HI> the injurious, if not <HI>to</HI> them: We pub∣lish them to men, and sometimes send them to heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is not only <HI>natural,</HI> but the injured have a <HI>right</HI> to complain. They have a right from the laws of na∣ture, which are the laws of God. If it is fit and rea∣sonable for any natural cause to produce its necessary effect; or for any natural law to have its genuine ope∣ration, then it must be lawful and right for the passions and affections of human nature to express themselves in their natural language: Consequently, the injured have a right to complain. Yea,</P>
<P N="3">3. They have not only a right to <HI>complain,</HI> but to be <HI>heard,</HI> and <HI>relieved.</HI> They have a right to be re∣placed in former circumstances and enjoyments; yea, in equity, a right to damages, or to be repaid for all losses and sufferings. Be the <HI>injurer</HI> never so high in dignity, and the <HI>injured</HI> never so low in degree, it al∣ters not the case. The <HI>greatest</HI> has no <HI>right,</HI> though he may have <HI>power</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> to do wrong, even to the <HI>meanest</HI>; and if he does, the latter has not only a right to complain, but to seek redress, and to obtain it. The injured, indeed, have no right to use inde∣cent language in their complaints, or improper mea∣sures in their endeavors to obtain relief. In a state of
<PB N="26" REF="013278_0024_0F904A14B1AA6E88"/>
nature, the sufferer may immediately avenge himself, or make reprisals, upon him that did the wrong. But in society, where there are laws and civil government, redress must be sought in a legal way. Complaint may be made to the aggressors; And in case they refuse to make amends, to those whose business it is to recti∣fy abuses, to punish evil-doers, and to redress the in∣jured.</P>
<P>"But what shall be done where the controversy lies betwixt the supreme power, and a part of the subjects; where the former, is supposed by the latter, to distress and injure them; to encroach upon their rights and liberties?" I shall not presume to give a full answer to this question; though I will venture to say, that an injured people have an undoubted right to complain, petition, and remonstrate. This, to besure, is a maxim in the <HI>British</HI> constitution. "But what if all their complaints, petitions and remonstrances are treated with neglect and contempt? To whom shall they appeal? or how shall they get redress? or must they, like <HI>asses,</HI> crouch down to every burden?" To this it may be re∣plied, that as the supreme power has no more right to deprive any of the subjects of their privileges, than one subject has to injure another, they may lawfully seek redress, and ought to obtain it, and may take every method to obtain it that prudence and reason, that e∣quity and the constitution will justify. When a reli∣gious and loyal people are oppressed, they may cer∣tainly prefer their petitions to heaven, in humble hope, that, <HI>no weapon formed against them</HI> shall be suffered to <HI>prosper</HI>; but on the contrary, that they shall be di∣rected and supported in their endeavors to maintain, or recover their just rights, and liberties. But with
<PB N="27" REF="013278_0025_0F904A1573CCE8F8"/>
regard to the lawfulness of opposition, I choose to make use of thoughts and expressions superior to my own. "It is exceeding difficult to determine exactly where submission ends, and resistance may lawfully take place, so as to leave no room for men of bad minds unrea∣sonably to oppose government, and destroy the peace of society. Most certainly, people ought to bear much before they engage in any attempts against those who are in authority. They ought to consider their rulers as frail and fallible men, who are liable to mis∣takes and faults even when their general aim is good and right. They should overlook their errors, and e∣ven their vices, if they are not such as tend directly to overturn the state, and bring distress and ruin on the whole community. Better a particular person, yea many individuals should suffer, than to encourage civil broils and a public disturbance. But where rulers per∣vert their power to tyrannical purposes; when they evidently encroach on natural and constitutional rights; when they trample on those laws which were made to limit the regal power, and defend the people, sub∣mission, if it can be avoided, is so far from being a du∣ty, that it is a crime. It is an offence against the state of which we are members, and whose happiness we ought to prefer to our chief joy. It is an offence a∣gainst mankind, whose rights we meanly betray. It is an offence against God, who is good to all, and who has appointed government for the welfare and happi∣ness, and not for the destruction of his creatures." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. ELIOT'S Election Sermon.</NOTE> The injured therefore have not only a right to com∣plain, but to be redressed, and to make use of every constitutional measure to obtain redress. Therefore,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="28" REF="013278_0026_0F904A163232C0F8"/>4. To deny them this right is a double injury and grievance. When a people have grounds to complain of unconstitutional measures in government, and of re∣peated encroachments upon their privileges; and when they utter their complaints in decent language, though with that noble freedom and firmness, which a sense of injury, joined with a love of liberty, will inspire, and instead of being heard, and encouraged, meet with only contempt and disgrace, how hard and injurious! And it seems the harder, when we reflect, that all earthly rulers should be imitators of Him whose <HI>kingdom ruleth over all,</HI> whose ears are open to the petitions of every humble suppliant, and who hears even <HI>the ravens when they cry.</HI></P>
<P>But this leads to a more particular consideration of the complicated sin in the text, which is represented as so hateful to God, and injurious to men, viz <HI>Op∣pression,</HI> which occasions complaints and outcries.</P>
<P>Men in power are not guilty of oppression, when they only use that authority, which the community has entrusted them with, for the general good. In∣deed, kings and subordinate magistrates may make an oppressive use of their prerogatives and powers, if so disposed. But so long as they keep within the bounds of the constitution, and in view of the general good, in the exercise of their authority, they are not to be accused of oppression. It is no more than their duty to exert the powers of their office to such a degree as is necessary to awe the licentious and turbulent, and to preserve the state in harmony and quiet. Indeed, there is little need of exercising authority merely for the sake of commanding reverence, or enforcing obedience,
<PB N="29" REF="013278_0027_0F904A16EE73A5B8"/>
where rulers make it appear that their talents and dis∣positions are equal to their stations, and that, not the gratification of their own private views, but the wel∣fare of the community, is their end in governing.</P>
<P>Neither is it oppression to put laws in execution a∣gainst obstinate offenders. Here again, the best good of the community must be the standard. For it execu∣tive officers were to construe the law in the most rigo∣rous sense it would bear, and recognize every supposed breach of the letter of it, they might, under colour of law, greatly disquiet and distress the subject. But when they only put the laws in execution for the punishment of evil-doers, and shew themselves <HI>God's ministers to execute wrath</HI> upon daring transgressors, they are to be commended for fidelity in their office.</P>
<P>Yea, where milder laws and punishments are found in∣sufficient, it is no part of oppression to institute <HI>severer,</HI> and to put them in execution against obstinate offend∣ers, who render life, liberty and property insecure.</P>
<P>And where <HI>rigor</HI> is necessary for the good of the state, <HI>rigor</HI> is not oppression.—It has often been tho't necessary, and therefore it has been practised in some cases, to make examples of some leading transgressors, by punishing them to the utmost extent of the law, <HI>in terrorem,</HI> to strike an awe into others, and deter them from the like offences. Again,</P>
<P>There may be instances wherein the innocent may be involved with the guilty, and suffer with them, or on their account, and yet those who ordered the pu∣nishment not be guilty of oppression. Thus, when a man has committed treason, he not only forfeits his
<PB N="30" REF="013278_0028_0F904A17B4B360F8"/>
own life, but all his estate and titles to the king; and thereby his innocent family are degraded and distressed. And when the inhabitants of a city, or province rise up in rebellion against their lawful prince, or lawful authority, it may occasion the distress, and perhaps cost the lives of many innocent persons, to reduce them to obedience.</P>
<P>Moreover, the raising of men for the defence of a nation against a dangerous enemy, is not oppression, though many perhaps are forced away from their friends and families, and useful employments, and return no more. In such a case, the general preservation absorbs all private connexions and concerns.</P>
<P>Neither is levying taxes, in a constitutional way, for the defreying necessary public expences, to be com∣plained of as oppression, though such taxes may be heavy and burdensome. Government must be sup∣ported, and the various officers that are requisite for steering, managing and securing the political vessel, ought to be rewarded according to the dignity and importance of their respective stations, and their fide∣lity in discharging the duties of them. Again,</P>
<P>There may be cases, wherein one part of the nation may be more burdened, or enjoy fewer privileges than the rest, and yet neither the king nor subordinate ru∣lers be guilty of oppression, Many political disad∣vantages may arise from extreme distance from the centre of business and of government; and from other unfavorable circumstances that cannot be avoided in this imperfect state. The various inhabitants of the earth, by reason of their different situations, do not e∣qually enjoy the benign influences of the sun, and yet
<PB N="31" REF="013278_0029_0F904A18DA6EF7C0"/>
there is no fault in this <HI>ruler of the day.</HI> "Every large community," says the author before quoted, "is con∣stituted of a number of little societies, in which there will be different branches of business. These, what∣ever pains are taken to prevent it, will have their differ∣ent connexions, and form seperate interests: It is vast∣ly difficult for those that govern, to keep the balance so exactly prized, as that neither part may be injured; but much more so, to prevent jealousies and suspicions that things are carried by favor and affection."</P>
<P>Many other negative particulars might no doubt be suggested by a person versed in politicks; but I pro∣ceed to say positively,</P>
<P>Oppression in rulers may be defined, an undue use, or stretch of power, to the injury of the subject.— "Whatever form of civil government men may have chosen, there are certain fundamental laws which mark out and fix the chief lines and boundaries between the authority of rulers, and the liberties and privileges of the people: And those can be no other than what are mutually agreed on, and consented to. Whatever au∣thority therefore, the supreme power has to make laws, to appoint officers, &amp;c. for the regulation and govern∣ment of the state, being an authority derived from the community and granted by them, can be justly exer∣cised only within certain limits, and to a certain extent, according to agreement. To suppose otherwise, and that without a delegated power, and constitutional right, rulers may make laws, and appoint officers for their execution, and force them into effect, i. e. accord∣ing to their own arbitrary will and pleasure, is to defeat the great end of civil government." And this would be oppression and tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="013278_0030_0F904A1962102378"/>It is essential to a free state, that no member of it shall have his property taken from him by taxation, or any other way, unless by his own consent, given personally, or by his representative. To infringe up∣on this right is another instance of tyranny and op∣pression.</P>
<P>'Tis a glorious privilege of <HI>Englishmen</HI> to be tried by their peers: To deprive them of this, is unconsti∣tutional and oppressive. To place courts of judicature upon such an establishment as to be exposed to parti∣ality and corruption; or so as that one contending party may have it in his power to distress, or ruin the other; to turn away the needy from their right, and prevent justice from taking place; this would be op∣pression: This would be to <HI>turn judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amos vi.12.</NOTE></P>
<P>When punishments are meditated and inflicted to gratify revenge, or merely to shew power and superi∣ority; or when they greatly exceed the demerit of the crime; or involve a whole community in distress for the offences of a few. When acts are made and con∣tinued, yea, and enforced by military power, which, in general, are considered as unconstitutional and grievous; all these are instances of oppression.</P>
<P>It is arbitrary and oppressive in rulers to infringe, curtail, and annihilate as they please, those charter rights which were granted to a people in the most solemn and explicit manner. For if they can at pleasure take away such grants without, nay, contrary to the consent, without a hearing, of the persons in their own vindica∣tion
<PB N="33" REF="013278_0031_0F904A1C4A7BBB28"/>
to whom those grants were made, what is there that they may not take away, since by those grants they are supposed to hold all their liberties and all their estates?</P>
<P>Other instances of oppression in rulers might be reckoned up; but I would now observe, as was hint∣ed before, that it is not a vice peculiar to men in au∣thority, but may be committed by people one among another. When people oppose the authority of their rulers, it is generally called insurrection and rebellion. And when a mob assumes the government into their own hands, they are in danger of committing such vi∣olence and outrage as are many degrees beyond the guilt and mischief of bare oppression. Yea, people, where they are not guilty of lawless riots, may combine and impose such restrictions, and severe conditions upon others, with intimidating threats, as shew that they themselves are as tyrannical, imperious and op∣pressive, as arbitrary rulers. In common dealings like∣wise, men may oppress one another by cheating, over-reaching and taking advantage of their necessities, ig∣norance and simplicity. The rich may oppress the poor by severe exactions; by taking them at distress; by harrassing them at law; and many other ways. Yea, people are guilty of oppression, not only by every act of trepass, fraud, and injustice; but by every de∣signed and needless delay of paying their just debts, whereby damage or difficulty accrues to the creditor.</P>
<P>That the word, <HI>oppression,</HI> is used in these senses by the sacred writers, is evident from a multitude of texts, which I shall leave you to recollect and peruse at your leisure; only observing, that the command to <HI>Israel</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="013278_0032_0F904A1D8E4313C8"/>
was, <HI>Thou shalt not oppress one another.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. xxv. 14.</NOTE> And the description of a people given up by God to the effects of their own wickedness, is thus exhibited. <HI>And the people shall be oppressed every one by another, and every man by his neighbour.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. iii. 5.</NOTE> But this brings me to the last observation, viz.</P>
<P N="3">III. When this is the case of a people, that instead of <HI>judgment,</HI> they are guilty of <HI>oppression</HI>; and in∣stead of <HI>righteousness,</HI> they occasion a <HI>cry,</HI> God may justly give them up to the consequences of their folly and wickedness, or send other distressing judgments among them.</P>
<P>When God <HI>looked</HI> that his vineyard <HI>should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes</HI>; or in the language of the text, <HI>when he looked for judg∣ment, but behold oppression; and for righteousness, but behold a cry,</HI> He utters this severe denunciation, <HI>And now, go to, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor digged; but there shall come up briars and thorns. I will also command the clouds, and they shall rain no rain upon it:</HI> As in the two verses immediately preceeding my text. A vineyard cannot be in a more ruinous condition than is here de∣scribed. And when the description is applied to a community, it must point out a most wretched situation. When a people, by their ingratitude and sinfulness, their injustice and oppression, have forfeited the pro∣tection of heaven, and incurr'd its displeasure, they are
<PB N="35" REF="013278_0033_0F904A1DB2EE3D10"/>
like a vineyard whose fence is broken down, and which has nothing to secure it from ravage and destruction. When they undervalue and misimprove their privile∣ges, whether civil or religious, they justly forfeit them to heaven, and are in danger of loosing them. <HI>They shall not be pruned nor digged,</HI> the means of cultiva∣tion and prosperity shall cease. <HI>I will command the clouds, and they shall rain no rain upon it</HI>; which may be fulfilled in a literal sense, and drought and scarcity may distress and impoverish them: Or in a moral and religious sense; the divine influences may be with∣holden, and people be left to their own hearts lusts, to fill up the measure of their iniquities, and to bring up∣on themselves swift destruction. Injustice and op∣pression prevailing among a people, are most pernici∣ous vices (as has been already demonstrated) and tend directly, not only to the vexation, but to the utter de∣struction of civil societies. But besides the natural ill consequences of them, they are provoking to God, who <HI>loveth righteousness and bateth iniquity,</HI> and who will not fail to testify his displeasure against those who <HI>spoil by violence,</HI> or <HI>oppress the poor and needy. Shall he not visit for these things; shall not his soul be a∣venged on such a nation as this? For thus hath the Lord of hosts said, hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: This is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her. As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wicked∣ness: Violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds. Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerem. vi. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Wo to the op∣pressing city: She obeyed not the voice; she received
<PB N="36" REF="013278_0034_0F904A1E76DC4020"/>
not correction; she trusted not in the Lord; she drew not near to her God. Her princes within her are rear∣ing lions; her judges are ravening wolves.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zeph. iii. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> These threatnings God had executed against his ancient peo∣ple, and against many others that were once distinguished by various important privileges, who are now utterly extinct, or else in abject slavery to cruel oppressors. This shews what other sinful nations have to fear from the prevalence of injustice and impiety; and the ab∣solute necessity of a timely and universal reformation. <HI>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. xiii. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Being thus led to the <HI>Improvement</HI> of the subject, I would gladly apply it to ourselves on this occasion: But I feel a peculiar difficulty in expressing myself at this season of doubtful, anxious expectation. Though I am full, I scarce know what to say; but, in general, to exhort and beseech you to repent, and throughly to amend every thing that is amiss in your temper and conduct; and to cry mightily to God, that he would turn away his anger from us, replace us in the favor of our King, and in the enjoyment of our liberties.</P>
<P>It is said, that 'God helps those that help themselves.' But what can we do? Our harbour is blocked up by ships of war; armed soldiers, in hostile appearance, are planted in our metropolis; the trade of that once flou∣rishing Town is destroyed; its inhabitants greatly dis∣tressed and impoverished; and multitudes in danger of being starved, were it not for the charity of others. And to compleat the concern and distress of the coun∣try, we find by the last accounts from <HI>England,</HI> that several other acts have passed both houses of parliament,
<PB N="37" REF="013278_0035_0F8FB8CE73171DE8"/>
whereby our most important charter-privileges are wrested from us. And all, for what? Because we have renounced subjection to the King of <HI>Great-Bri∣tain,</HI> and have set up for independency? Because we are unwilling to be on the same footing with our bre∣thren and fellow-subjects in <HI>England,</HI> and refuse to take up with the same privileges which they enjoy? By no means. It is not on account of all, or of any one of these reasons. For we rejoice in being the subjects of King GEORGE: We rejoice in being part of the <HI>British</HI> dominions; and we consider a close, constitu∣tional connexion with the nation as our safety, our hap∣piness, and our glory. We want nothing but the pri∣vileges of <HI>British</HI> subjects, and to be considered and treated as entitled to them. We are unwilling to have our estates, or our charter-rights at the arbitrary dis∣posal of a distant legislature, in which we can have no voice. We mean only to maintain those privileges, which were confirmed to our fathers, and have been transmitted to us, and to which we have an unquesti∣onable right as <HI>men,</HI> and as <HI>Englishmen.</HI> We have no design to oppose any authority that is constitutionally founded and exercised; but only to <HI>stand fast in the liberty wherewith God,</HI> and our charter, <HI>hath made us free.</HI> And yet, such is the indignity and cruelty with which we are treated, as mentioned above! And amidst all these oppressions, we have little, or no encourage∣ment to petition or complain, but only to heaven. If any stand up for us and interceed in our behalf, they are scorn'd and disgrac'd: If we consult together for mutual security, we are deemed mobish and riotous: If we attempt to throw off our burdens, we are re∣proach'd as rebels: If we adopt the most peaceable method to help ourselves, by laying aside all luxuries
<PB N="38" REF="013278_0036_0F904A1F2E6EAC48"/>
and superfluities, and subsisting by our own industry and frugality (which is no more than our distressed sit∣uation renders necessary) we are rail'd and proclaim'd against as traitors. What then can be done? What steps can be taken by us for our relief? There is one course which reason and religion point out as the most effec∣tual, and which, if universally adopted, and persevered in (as God grant it may be) will greatly mitigate, if not wholly remove, the calamities we suffer; and that is, to <HI>live soberly, righteously, and godly in the world. Sobriety</HI> includes frugality and temperance, the retrench∣ment of every unnecessary expence, and reducing every inordinate appetite to the standard of reason. <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> comprehends all those duties we owe to one another, and which, if generally practised, will obviate innumerable difficulties, and make a society comforta∣ble and easy, united and prosperous. <HI>Godliness</HI> com∣prizes the duties which more immediately respect our Creator, which are attended with inward satisfaction, and, in conjunction with the foregoing virtues, never fail to conciliate the favor of heaven, and to procure freedom and happiness.</P>
<P>The aspects of providence are indeed gloomy and perplexing: More so perhaps, than ever they were since our fathers fled from oppression at home, to the woods of <HI>America.</HI> But let us not be overwhelmed with me∣lancholly and despair, which unhinge the mind, unbrace our resolutions, and unnerve our endeavors. There have heretofore been <HI>Days, wherein God afflicted</HI> our an∣cestors, and <HI>Years, wherein they saw evil</HI>▪ But though <HI>for a small moment he forsook them,</HI> yet <HI>with great mercies did he gather them:</HI> Though <HI>in a little wrath he hid his face from them, for a moment,</HI> yet he soon

<HI>turned again and caused his face to shine upon them, and they were saved.</HI> Let us, for our encouragement, re∣member the years of the right hand of the most High, and the works he did in the days of our fathers, when they made God their refuge and confidence, in the way of well-doing, and found him <HI>a very present help in trouble.</HI> He is the same God, <HI>merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keep∣ing covenant and mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin.</HI> And if we do not retain our ini∣quities as a wall of separation between God and us, to hinder good things from us, we shall yet be a free and a happy people. Indeed, when we consider our abounding immoralities, our flesh may well trem∣ble for fear of God, and we may be afraid of his judgments. The calamities we feel, are no doubt the tokens of the divine displeasure against us for our sins: For God does not pour out the vials of his wrath upon a people, unless to punish them for their disobe∣dience. Though we are unwilling to own that we have forfeited our privileges into the hands of men, yet must we not confess, that by our ingratitude and rebel∣lion against heaven, we have forfeited them all into the hands of God? Though we have been under peculiar obligations, being a free and enlightened people, to ex∣ercise loving kindness, judgment and righteousness in the earth; yet when God <HI>looked for judgment, hath he not beheld oppression; and for righteousness hath he not heard a cry?</HI> Have we not practised too much of the same oppressive, encroaching, tyrannical temper towards one another, which we have complained of in some of our rulers towards us? Have we not committed, or countenanced unkindness and injustice? Either wrong∣ing our neighbor in his estate, or good name, or deny∣ing

him that freedom to which he had a right? Have we not been too apt to censure and condemn the views and measures of men in office? Have we not abused the inestimable privileges we have enjoyed as men, as chri∣stians, and as <HI>British</HI> subjects, to the purposes of licen∣tiousness and extravagance? And is it not for this that we are punished by the diminution of them? But what∣ever particular vices have provoked God to bring us low by oppression, it behoves us to be sincere and uni∣versal in our repentance and reformation, and then we shall be sure of getting rid of our worst enemies. Let us search and try our ways and turn to the Lord with our whole heart and not feignedly, and then he will have mercy upon us, and deliver us out of the hand of the oppressor, and we shall no longer <HI>cry out of wrong and not be heard.</HI> Let us, in this day of adversity, humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt us in due time. Renouncing all impiety, injustice and uncharitableness, let us become <HI>righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordi∣nances of the Lord blameless.</HI> Let us love one another, for love is the fulfilling of the law. Let us not forget the necessity of subordination and government, nor the obedience that is due-to the laws, nor the respect and submission that we owe to those who are cloathed with authority. Let us <HI>honor all men; love the brother∣hood; fear GOD, and honor the King.</HI> Then may we hope that he who was the God of our fathers, will con∣tinue to be our God, and the God of our posterity, from generation to generation. <HI>O</HI> then, <HI>that there were such an heart in us, that we would fear him, and keep all his commandments always, that it might be well with us and with our children for ever.</HI> AMEN.</P>
