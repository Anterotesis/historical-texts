<HEAD>AN EARNEST CALL: ADDRESSED TO THE Inhabitants of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY effort to support and strengthen the Christian cause, to inculcate the amiable principles of virtue and morality, to dissemi∣nate the glad tidings of salvation through a glorious Mediator, to impress upon the de∣generate and careless sinner, sensations of the vast and inconceivably important realities of a judgment to come, and a never-ending eternity of happiness or misery.—Such at∣tempts deserve the encouragement and pat∣ronage of all good members of society, all those who are anxious to preserve the tran∣quility and well-being of their country. For righteousness will prove an impenetrable bar∣rier in securing the permanency of a govern∣ment; whilst every species of vice must tend to enervate, debilitate, and finally sap the foundation of the wisest constitution. For the Almighty will be a canopy and safeguard to his faithful servants.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="025427_0003_0FCCE3CE1EFA11A8"/>
UPON the candour of my readers, and my own conscious rectitude, I must depend for the reception of this Publication: at least I shall enjoy the inward satisfaction of con∣tributing mercy mite, to rouse mankind from their stupor, and promote the cause of Chris∣tianity. And I can assure my readers that I am not instigated to this undertaking, by selfish motives; but am directed for the good of souls, and the glory of God. Should it in any degree answer the much desired pur∣pose, I shall be amply compensated for my labors.</P>
<P>GRANT, O thou inexhaustible Fountain of all good, thy enlightning, enfluencing, all-prevailing grace, to make my pen like that of a ready writer; in awakening, con∣vincing and converting those, who have never participated of the ineffable riches of divine grace and pardoning love, which flow inces∣santly from the right hand of the immacu∣late Jesus! O that I may experience that sweet complacence and serenity—that clear∣ness of perception—and that divine illumi∣nation, from the immutable Source of per∣fection, which are necessary for all those who engage in thy service! Suffer no fascinating allurements of worldly objects to draw me aside, or the seducing wiles of the devil to pervert my pen from the simplicity and puri∣ty of the unerring Word of Truth. O thou whose wisdom never degenerates into craft, justice into severity, or mercy into weakness!
<PB N="5" REF="025427_0004_0FCCE3D041A1F030"/>
direct my mind in this undertaking! With∣out thy blessing I can do nothing; every effort will be as the sounding brass or tink∣ling cymbal: but under the auspecious influ∣ence of thy spirit, I trust thy kingdom may be advanced—thy church militant more and more established, and that many precious souls may taste the pure, unsullied joys, that flow from thee! Grant this, for thy dear Son's sake.</P>
<P>I MUST beg leave to premise, that I shall sedulously wave all disputation on the con∣troverted points of Christianity. It is far from my intentions to engage as a champion in the vindication of any jarring opinions of scholastic divinity; which perhaps is not worth the contention, or not at all necessary to salvation. Neither intrude upon the "sep∣tical subtilties" of Deists: nor shall I perplex myself or readers, with the deep researches of metaphysical disquisition. I shall submit such lucubrations to those who are more pen∣etrating, or consider them of more conse∣quence than myself: for I have long enter∣tained the opinion, that controversies have a very pernicious effect; and are generally cre∣ative of animosity, envy, hatred, and the very passions that are the most unlike those inculcated, by the meek and lowly Jesus. Scripture expressly commandeth to avoid all vain contentions. How is it possible for Christians, to reconcile that implacable spirit of bitterness and acrimony, with which con∣troversies
<PB N="6" REF="025427_0005_0FCCE3D11369A678"/>
are maintained? So high is the resentment of the opponents sometimes rais∣ed, that they catch with avidity at any clue, however weak or opposite to truth, to extend the controversy, interlarded with scurrility and abuse. And disputants are generally predetermined not to acquiesce in the opini∣on advanced against their own, however sanctioned by truth, or guided by reason.—Disputes sow the seeds of hatred and malev∣olence, and finally terminate in open rup∣ture! And it is a lamentable fact, that good men sometimes greatly err in this. Is it not devoutly to be wished, that all jarring opini∣ons and dissentions could forever cease? And is it not fervently to be desired, that the fol∣lowers of Jesus of every denomination, should join together in an amicable league of har∣monious love? Is not every Christian con∣strained to exclaim, "Accelerate O God, that glorious period, when peace, uninter∣rupted, triumphant peace! shall reign on earth! when the kingdom of this world, shall become the kingdom of God and his Christ! and anti-christ no more be suffered to diffuse his baneful seed." Are not all Christians desirous of attaining the same haven? Do not their desires inseparably centre there? Why then should one say, "I am of Paul," another, "I am of Apol∣los," since Jesus Christ is all in all, and through his name alone can we be saved. Do we invariably observe his affectionate
<PB N="7" REF="025427_0006_0FCCE41FD5CC5E38"/>
mandate, "Love one another?" Can we do this and at the same time foster the worm∣wood of gall and bitterness in our bosoms?</P>
<P>THERE was never perhaps a more gloomy season, never a period more pregnant with calamities, and "big with death," in the city of Philadelphia, than the present. Her streets are become desolate, and the goodly prospect, is quite reversed! Was there ever a time that called with a more audible voice, for a sud∣den, sincere and unreserved reformation? The wrath of the Almighty seems inflamed against this City—his wrath impregnated with death!—His fiery indignation scatters terror around!—The light of his countenance is hidden from us—his long suffering patience is at length exhausted—his mercies slighted—his gospel despised! At length the sword of his indignation, the sharp two edged sword of wrath is unsheathed. And his vindictive justice must be satisfied. His thunders arm∣ed with triple horror and vengeful fire, sleep no more; but hang impending over our guil∣ty heads, replete with mortality. "Yet the reed, the brittle reed, just sinking, may re∣commend us to the Rock of ages!"</P>
<P>I KNOW there are many who attribute this awful Contagion to natural causes, and ridicule the idea of a supernatural agent: but I conceive, we may clearly trace the finger of God in our chastisement. Although his ways are a great deep to mortals, and some∣times dark and inscrutable to finite intelli∣gences;
<PB N="8" REF="025427_0007_0FCCE4215B76A3C0"/>
yet here his wonder-working wis∣dom is manifest, and those who are dispas∣sionate, and not wholly blinded by the god of this world, may behold omnipotent ven∣geance carried on.—Let any one of my read∣ers lay his hand upon his heart, and ask his conscience if he has not contributed his share in provoking the wrath of almighty God: if after an impartial examination he receives an acquital; I salute him as a thrice happy soul! and pronounce, that he need not trem∣ble at the approach of any pestilential disease, however deadly, nor death itself with all its frightful apparatus!</P>
<P>THE present afflicting season most strik∣ingly depicts, the amazing folly, and fatal delusion of those whose affections are inor∣dinately attached to the fluctuating, unstable enjoyments of a vain world. These solemn seens of mortality will lead us to reflect, that there is no permanency in any worldly pleas∣ure. How soon, alas! do all the guilded baubles vanish, (in which we have placed such durable gratification) and leave nothing to satisfy the famishing soul! The earth and all the fulness thereof, with all the blandish∣ments of time and sense, can never be a suf∣ficient value to attach the rational, immortal mind! This transitory state can never bound its attainments, it ardently pants for the ce∣lestial joys of a kingdom <HI>whose builder and maker is God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="025427_0008_0FCCE422DB267C38"/>
DEATH, is truly an all-eloquent preacher, it convinces powerfully, when all arguments have been wielded to no purpose—it points and says, "Be ye also ready!"—for in such an hour as ye know not, the fatal arrow will receive its irresistible mandate! Nay often attacks those who are hugging themselves, saying, "I will enjoy the fruits of my labor and lay up wealth for future grandeur—soul, soul, take thy rest." Fatal security! fool!—to imagine thyself safe, when death is even now approaching towards thee with rapid strides, like a "staunch murderer, steady to his purpose:" and perhaps in a few hours all thy braggart hopes will be included in a mouldering coffin of inanimate clay:
<Q><L><HI>—Death's subtle seed within,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sly treacherous minor, working in the dark,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Smil'd at thy well concerted scheme, and beckond,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A worm to riot on a rose so sweet,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Unfaded as it fell! a moments prey!—</HI></L>
<BIBL>Dr. YOUNG.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE dear parent leaves the world, unmind∣ful of his tender offspring, suffused in tears! "The beloved spouse perishes in the embrac∣es of her husband.—Death shews no pity, he relents not at her parting sighs, nor at the fervor of her supplications one hour!" "Now he hurls his dart at the poor peasant, and now launches it at the monarch on his throne:" they indiscriminately mingle with
<PB N="10" REF="025427_0009_0FCCE4245BE0DF10"/>
the silent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and fall unresisting victims to the unerring stroke.</P>
<P>THE express declaration of inspiration must convince every believer, that judgments are often inflicted upon rebellious and gain∣saying generations, as a chastisement for their departure from him. If we turn to the sa∣cred volume, we shall find this invariably the case, in God's dealings with the old world, whenever they apostatized, the scourges of his rod pursued them.—I do not expect to convince those who sacrilegiously deny the divine origin of the Scripture, of this sacred truth: the power of omnipotence alone, will strike conviction into obstinate unbelieving souls; yet God is not a man that he should change, he is the same immutably, perfect being, that he then was, and we are equally the objects of his care. Sin caused the utter distruction of the ante-deluvians. Their prime∣val rectitude was transformed, and they were immersed in every species of licentiousness, pride and corruption. The Almighty beheld it afar off, and sent his avenging ministers of wrath to destroy them. <HI>And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every immagination of the heart was evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth. And God said I will destroy man whom I have created.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> Thus was his indignation signally and terribly man∣ifested
<PB N="11" REF="025427_0010_0FCCE49F646AE810"/>
in their distruction. And thus will it be with all those who persevere in abusing his mercies, and contumeliously rejecting the son of his love!—Wickedness caused the dis∣truction and overthrow of Sodom and Go∣morrah. <HI>And the Lord said, because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is very great, and be∣cause their sins are very grievous, &amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii. 20.</NOTE> Many parallel instances in Scripture might be pro∣duced, were it necessary.</P>
<P>AH Sirs! suffer yourselves no longer to be deceived by the god of this world. Our in∣iquities have provoked Jehovah's avenging wrath, they pierce the vaulted skies with a voice more extensive than the innocent blood of Abel, shed by a brother!—Are we not crucifying afresh the blessed Jesus, by our ingratitude and perverseness? Is he not fre∣quently wounded in the house of his friends, and put to open shame! And is there noth∣ing reprehensible in such conduct? nothing to provoke the omnipotent Godhead? Are we not far more guilty than Cain, in our obstinate rejecting of one, who ought to be infinitely more precious to us than the dear∣est brother? One who has already lavished, and is still able to bestow greater remunera∣tions and blessings, than all earthly relatives! And this glorious reversion is beneficently prof∣fered to us, without money, or without price—our acceptance and obedience is all that is
<PB N="12" REF="025427_0011_0FCCE4A0DA948508"/>
requied. Permit me to ask, if you have highly estimated such invaluable benefits? Have you returned any part of that love, that transcendant love, with which he has loved you? Have you bowed the knee of unfeigned humility and thankfulness, to this infinite lover? Has his condescending good∣ness constrained you to receive him in a vi∣tal union, by the living covenant of faith; and to cry out with believing Thomas, <HI>My Lord and my God!</HI> Perhaps you have never yet meditated, never yet revolved in your mind the plenitude of his love to a ruined race! Perhaps you have frequently treated with contempt, those who appeared concern∣ed for the salvation of your soul! Poor de∣luded mortal! you are entirely unacquainted with the intrinsic excellence of spiritual things! or the worth of your immortal soul:
<Q><L><HI>Which must blaze on for ages, when the sun,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Fair trasitory creature of a day,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is lost in night.</HI></L>
<BIBL>Mrs. BAR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>AULD.</BIBL></Q>
Do you from henceforth seriously determine you will serve the Lord? Glorious resolu∣tion! and worthy the highest aspiration of an immortal soul!—Persevere, let me beseech you persevere in this resolve—let no obstruc∣tions, no impediments, hinder your pressing forward to the mark of your high calling in Christ Jesus. Let no consideration draw your feet aside, or retard your course—relax
<PB N="13" REF="025427_0012_0FCCE4A3281C7A78"/>
not for a moment in your pursuit! Remem∣ber it is a diadem of unfading lustre you are in pursuit of; this will animate you in the Christian warfare. In a short space, all ma∣terial difficulties will insensibly vanish away, and a life of holiness will appear as the dilu∣table source of happiness. At last the rug∣ged precipices, and the rocky ascents of life, shall fly before you like a transient meteor! All trouble and anguish shall forever cease, and the fulness of joy spread its plumes around you with refulgent glory! Hail hap∣py mansions of the blest! And all hail thrice happy inhabitant of these regions! You have changed the filthy garments of your own righteousness, and made them white in the blood of the LAMB! You shall be presented "like the king's daughter, all glorious with∣in, and all your rament of wrought gold!"</P>
<P>SUFFER me at this place to delineate, and point out the most crying sins, that have pro∣voked our God to anger; that by a speedy return, we may prevail upon him to rebuke the disorder, and say; "Hitherto shalt thou go—and no farther."
<Q><HI>For these things will I visit them, saith the Lord God!</HI></Q></P>
<P>HIS threatnings have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ally ful∣filled in all ages—though he may wait long, and endure much—his indignation will at last break forth, and where shall men hide from his avenging hand?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="025427_0013_0FCCE4A4A0C04700"/>
How shall I enter upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able catalogue of our innumerable transgressions, which are like mountains piled upon mountains. How are we fallen from an orb not our own, and accumulated repeated sins of omission and commission? How is the gold changed! and the most fine gold become dim!—Shall I not declare the whole counsel of God, without any palliatives to lull the soul into a more carnal security? The wound must first be made, the incision must be submitted to, how∣ever painful and excruciating the operation may be, before the sovereign balm of Gilead can be applied.</P>
<P>PROPHANE swearing has of late shed its baneful contagion, in a most alarming degree in this city; notwithstanding the most solemn and repeated prohibitions against such a God-provoking sin. "Swear not at all," says the inspired penman: and again. "Take not the name of the Lord thy God in vain." Our streets are replete with the most horrid imprecations of blasphemies. The great, holy and immaculate name, which archangels pro∣nounce with the most profound veneration, is used upon the most vile and trifling occa∣sions, with all the attendant aggravations that a genius fertile in wickedness could invent. The most ridiculous tales receive the sanction of numerous attestations of this kind. How shocking, how affrontive must this be to the Divine Majesty of heaven? He who could with an inconsiderable exertion of omnipo∣tence,
<PB N="15" REF="025427_0014_0FCCE4A61B96A328"/>
crush the impious authors, and plunge them into the abyss of eternal, never ending despair! How heart-rending must such pic∣tures of degenerate mortality, be to the Christian! How sincerely must he lament over the fatal mistakes and depravity of his fellow mortals? He retires under the pres∣sure of affliction to his closet, and with a torrent of commiserating tears, exclaims in some such language as this; Pity, heavenly Father, those creatures who have made them∣selves so exceedingly sinful and obnoxious to thee!—O turn them from such awful profli∣gacy—picture their folly in all its odious de∣formity.—Turn, O turn them from eternal death! Lord thy children mourn incessantly for them—hear the united prayers of thy ser∣vants, and finally, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.—Swearers cannot have the least shadow of vindication, to plead an extenuation of their wickedness. Some vices may afford a brutal pleasure to gratify; but this sin does not even admit of this poor palliation. No man is born of a swearing constitution, nor can it be of the least conceivable advantage. What then is the wonderful inducement to it? what valu∣able end can the swearer propose to himself? It requires not the least exertion of genius to make a perfect adept in this accomplishment; and this is obvious that the most illiterate of mankind excel in swearing. It is pathetically to be lamented, that men of consequence
<PB N="16" REF="025427_0015_0FCCE4A7BB3800F0"/>
should indulge themselves in so pernicious and illiberal a practice. I am clearly of opinion, did such persons give themselves the trouble of deliberating upon the probable termination of it, a regard for their country; mere political motives would effectually de∣ter rulers, from setting so destructive a prece∣dent before the governed. It must inevita∣bly tend to invalidate the validity of oaths, upon which in a great measure depends the firmness of the constitution. This naturally assists in the introduction of perjury; from which crimes of the most enormous magni∣tude naturally flow. But what shall I say to the fluttering, giddy herd of profligates and libertines, on this head? What effect can I hope to have on such who seldom peruse any books, exclusive of plays, romances, &amp;c. who would consider it an intolerable piece of drudgery, at being compelled to read a <HI>dull performance</HI> on Christianity. With gilded plumage, an audacious effrontery of coun∣tenance, and a well-timed oath (as they ex∣press it,) they impose upon the undiscerning and illiterate, as persons of profound impor∣tance, and as a proper pattern for imitation: when alas! they are rendering themselves obnoxious to the displeasure of their heaven∣ly Father. Their wisdom is at best but low cunning, for they degrade themselves by vices, unworthy the character of Christians, unwor∣thy the image they ought represent, and un∣worthy of men. Strip such mortals of their
<PB N="17" REF="025427_0016_0FCCE4AA57038A60"/>
borrowed plumes, their blushing honors—investigate them through a right medium, and they will appear objects of pity rather than envy: "For a follower of Jesus should view vice with detestation, whilst he looks upon the vicious, with the tenderness of a pitying angel."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter.</NOTE></P>
<P>SWEARING then, can be used for no other purpose than to show a brutal courage, in greatly daring to disobey the Lord of glory, and defy his power; in fighting against the supreme majesty of heaven, and speaking more irreverently of the King of kings, than they dare of a petty prince. Is it not a very alarming presage of a still greater judgment, when children are heard lisping out oaths before they can speak intelligibly! when <HI>comparative</HI> infants make the streets resound with oaths and execrations? This would alone, convince us of our depravity and wickedness; and that this is strictly conso∣nant with veracity, all who have the organs of hearing will jointly bear testimony. Is there any one who has a spark of genuine piety in his heart, but must be touched with the most sensible and agonizing grief, at the afflicting sight? O ye <HI>parents,</HI> have ye no commiseration for your children? If so, what do such scenes exhibit to your imagin∣ations? Is the idea delightful that your children improve in prophanity? Can you
<PB N="18" REF="025427_0017_0FCCE4AB5D13C190"/>
consider it a valuable acquisition? You doubtless answer in the negative. Well, do you practice the probable means to stop them in their mad career? Do you frequently and solemnly animadvert upon this wicked prac∣tice? Do you inculcate an abhorrence of it, and enforce the precepts by your own exam∣ple? without which it is madness to expect any instruction can be influential. Do you pour out the effusions of your hearts before the throne of grace, with, and for your off∣spring? Alas! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have great reason to fear that such precautions are not sufficiently at∣tended to, or at least too slightly touched up∣on. I believe it is not at all uncharitable to pronounce, that such parents are the bitter∣est and most implacable enemies to their chil∣dren, who suffer such practices to pass by unnoticed, and unregarded. I dread to think of the natural consequences resulting from inattention to the morals of youth. Suffer me for a moment to trace it beyoud the grave—At the great and solemn day of retribu∣tion, you may expect to see those very chil∣dren whom you love with such a foolish fond∣ness, accusing you before God, of being ac∣cessory to their everlasting misery—of ruin∣ing their souls and rendering them complete∣ly unhappy forever!</P>
<P>THE violation of the Sabbath is another flagrant and glaring offence, against the Al∣mighty and his express command; "Re∣member the Sabbath to keep it holy." It is
<PB N="19" REF="025427_0018_0FCCE4AD440CE938"/>
notorious and needs no confirmation, that the holy day is perverted by many, and per∣verted for answering the most unjustifiable purposes. Else, whence so much visiting, unnecessary rambling (not to mention great∣er enormities) on this sacred day! Do not the ways of Zion mourn for this? Are not the attibutes of the Deity shamefully and ir∣reverently treated by this practice? And is not God incensed at the violation of so plain and declarative a commandment? Are not public houses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Taverns, tippling houses, &amp;c.</NOTE> filled with idlers on this day? Does not inebriety and intoxication frequent∣ly succeed; and then all kinds of execrations reverberate from unhallowed lips? And more shameful still, the sacred day is sometimes employed in rattling the dice, or "detaching and arranging painted paste-boards." Ah Sirs! you are sporting on a tremendous precipice, which may dash you and all your full-blown hopes on the rock of never never ending dis∣pair and woe! Ye are voluntarily disposing of your eternal all, for momentary delusive gratifications, for gay visionary dreams of pleasure. That mandate of devoting one day in seven to rest and devotion, is a per∣fectly reasonable as well as necessary com∣mand. It is a truly benevolent ordination, and worthy the sapience of the divine author. And how ungrateful is it to repine at the ap∣pointment, so just and good in itself? How
<PB N="20" REF="025427_0019_0FCCE4AED0BE25E8"/>
exceedingly culpable are those, who treat it with indifference.</P>
<P>O LET me conjure you to strive to avert the present and future judgments, by a sud∣den reformation in hallowing and keeping holy this day. Do not vainly imagine that God will hold you guiltless if, in defiance to this, his most reasonable mandate, you know∣ingly transgress the Sabbath of the Lord. Alas! if you neglect this admonition, the time swiftly approaches, when you would give worlds to purchase the probationary term of a few Sabbaths. When you stand upon the verge of death; when conviction has seized you, and your deplorable situation puts on the most affrightful aspect. Every reflection at this dreadful period will tend to aggravate your woe—not the least glimpse of hope re∣mains—horrible amazement, and wild des∣pair glares around—O how you execrate your folly for mispending your invaluable time—disregarding Sabbaths, and spurning at Christianity. Alas! all this can avail nothing.</P>
<P>O THEN for God's sake, and for your own sakes, for the time to come, hallow the Sabbath-day. Let your penitential tears as∣cend to the throne of purity, acceptable and well pleasing sacrifices—Earnestly intreat your heavenly Father that he would stop the growing sin of Sabbath breaking. Such de∣votional exercises on this holy day, will be attended with the divine blessing—and the
<PB N="21" REF="025427_0020_0FCCE4B003130C60"/>
spirit of all grace will animate those who conscientiously practice prayer, thanksgiving and praise on this day.</P>
<P>FAMILY prayer is a duty incumbent upon all who are parents, masters or guardians over families. What is deprecated upon prayerless communities? <HI>Pour out thy wrath upon those families who call not upon my name.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. x. 25.</NOTE> And yet this great duty is shamefully neglect∣ed, and frequently treated with contempt and ridicule. And when it is performed at all, have we not cause to lament of the cold and inanimate manner which attends it? Where shall we observe that propriety, that decency of behaviour which is requisite on such occasions? Is it not greatly to be ap∣prehended, that the whole mind is not en∣tirely engrossed by heavenly aspirations? and that worldly objects have too great a share in the affections? To a considerate mind, prayer ought to be esteemed the most inval∣uable privilege, that mortals can enjoy: by this sweet intercourse, a vital communion is maintained between God and the soul—O how precious are such seasons! how is the whole soul drawn out towards the fountain of grace. We are admitted by prayer into his presence, and participate of his pardon∣ing love and condescending goodness. By prayer we rise toward perfection, and be∣come more inseparably connected to our
<PB N="22" REF="025427_0021_0FCCE4B2F7752C90"/>
heavenly Father. I am persuaded, that by this means we attain to what Mr. Addison beau∣tifully speaks of—"There is not in my opin∣ion, a more pleasing and triumphant consid∣eration in religion, than this, of the perpet∣ual progress which the soul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever ar∣riving at a period." This noble attainment is gained by prayer.—Supposing an earthly monarch to issue a proclamation throughout his dominions, that on a day appointed his subjects should assemble around his throne, and whatsoever demands they would make, he promised to grant. If at the day appoint∣ed they universally appear, and instead of making known there requests, they fall asleep in his presence—would not his majesty be highly offended and punish their neglect? How much more then our heavenly Father, who is willing to bestow such unspeakably precious gifts. Nothing then can excuse any person from joining in the exercise of public or private prayer.</P>
<P>How beautiful it is, when houses are made vocal with the grateful incense of prayer and praise! How sweetly are the devout aspira∣tions of the sincere heart wafted on the silver∣ed wings of the dove, to the holy of holies; and return with tenfold blessings, like the fructifying moisture of the spring, on the petitioners head! he receives the anticipation and foretaste of the joys of heaven—the ra∣diant glory of the cherubim, seraphim, and

all the celestial choir of beatific spirits, ap∣pear with unsullied robes of purest white to his rapt imagination! they inraptured touch their golden harps, and the trembling music floats around—The Christian beholds in fan∣cy the face of the LAMB!—"He sees the display of paradisiacal innocence, the lofty, the resplendant traces of the son of GOD! This fills him with silent extacy, he is too highly blessed to be affraid of man: elevated by a flaming ardor, his eye is serene, filled with the irresistible fire of awful virtue." Thus Christians sometimes enjoy communion with GOD, which is better felt than described.</P>
<P>PRIDE is a sin fearfully prevailing among us at this period. Its pernicious and distruc∣tive tendency is sufficiently realized, and ac∣knowledged by all. All agree in decrying the turpitude of it; and sometimes the most ar∣rogant repudiate it with a greater degree of inveterancy than the really humble of heart. The devil makes use of pride as the chief in∣strument of our undoing. Every precaution is necessary to conquer this truly formidable enemy. <HI>Be not high minded, but fear,</HI> says the apostle. We ought to keep a strict cen∣tinal, in order to guard every avenue of the human heart, and repulse the fasci∣nating enemy, opposing force to force. Its baneful influence infuses itself into every faculty of the soul, and rankles in each vein.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vulnus alit venis et coeco carpiter igni. VIRG.</NOTE>

A writer observes, "That pride is a rank weed, and generally takes root in a barren soil." From this passion naturally flows many other hateful and discordant vices, degrading to the rational nature, and dishonoring to the Deity. It impels the mind to grasp at unwarrantable attainments, and produces an unceasing solicitude.</P>

<P>To define pride in all its different positions, windings and eccentricities, is perhaps a task impossible to be performed. It operates ex∣tremely different in different persons; and sometimes rankles at the heart of apparent humility. Shall we continue to foster a ser∣pent in our bosoms, that thief like infixes its barbed stings into our hearts, and by poi∣soning the fountain, renders the streams nox∣ious and impure? Is not pride its own cease∣less tormentor? The pomp and spledour of the great, excites this passion. We strug∣gle with ambitious and aspiring hope. "The glowing pencil of fancy, dipt in her own creative ideas," pictures to the mind perma∣net happiness in delusive, vanishing trifles!</P>
<P>Do the scenes at this period continually exhibited before us, furnish matter for pride and ostentation? Do charnel houses and graves inspire that mad principle? Does the gauzy mantle of death excite your arrogance? Do Cypress weeds, and mournful funeral
<PB N="25" REF="025427_0024_0FCCE4B82E9195C8"/>
obsequies serve to inflame your ambition! Do not such distressing scenes rather level your pride prostrate with the dust? and awaken your whole souls in anxious solici∣tude for your safety? If neither the long suffering goodness of God, nor his fierce judgments have any effect—think for once, you hear your deceased friends and relations who have departed before you, addressing you form their everlasting habitations: "Pre∣pare, prepare for eternity, ye frail short-lived mortals—ye dear neighborers to the world of spirits—ye borderers on heaven and hell, <HI>make ready—</HI> loosen your hearts from earth, and all that it contains—weigh anchor, and prepare to launch into the boundless ocean of eternity, which is now within your ken, and roars within your hearing!"</P>
<P>THE pride of man revolts at the humiliat∣ing doctrine of the cross. Proud assuming man, immediately takes the alarm when a crucified, despised "Jesus of Nazareth," is held up as a proper example for their imita∣tion. They flee <HI>from the Rock of safety,</HI> to the contaminated garments of their own car∣nal righteousness. They thus hang uncon∣scious of danger, over a tremendous gulf, suspended by a scarce percepible thread!—Perhaps the pride of the human heart, cannot be exerted in any point of vice, more de∣structive to itself, than in this dangerous re∣jection, of all that is salutary to the soul. It is this I fear that ruins many precious souls.

Thus "The empty pageant of a day fondly rolls along;" exulting in his boasted strength and self-sufficiency: he bestows not a thought on futurity, and rides on fortunes passing gale in triumph. But beware giddy mortal, left like the fabled Isarus whilst soaring aloft, the invisible archer precipitates thy fall, and plunges thee where hope can never come. What hast thou that thou didst not receive? Whence then are such ambitious thoughts? Dost thou imagine thy pampered body will survive the wreck of matter? Did the arm∣ipotent Cesar fall at last? Did the Macedo∣nian Madman, after conquering the world and despoiling nations, extend his conquests beyond the period of three-score years and ten?

of grace, is sweetly constrained to exercise benevolence and humanity to all mankind; whom he now considers as his brethren. This is the peculiar prerogative of divine illumina∣tion; that it excites to charity, and diffuses philanthropy—vain and worse than vain, are all pretentions to Christianity without this, which is the essence, the foundation of all religion. Religion was founded upon love—and so far as we act according to this pow∣erful principle, so much the nearer resem∣blance we obtain to the Founder of salvation. To show our holiness in the most conspicu∣ous light, we must comfort the distressed, bind up the broken heart, raise the drooping, desponding mind, and exert ourselves to ren∣der society more happy. What avail our prayers, our pompous professions, or our bearing the name of Christ, if we send the hungry from our doors, refuse to comfort and relieve the naked traveller, and turn a deaf ear to the cries of the widow and father∣less—Ah Sirs! whoever you are, think not that you are Christians, not attending to a duty, without which, you are worse than in∣fidels. It is much to be feared there are many who have all the externals of religion, whose hearts are insensible to the soft ties of hu∣manity—persons who despise their neigh∣bors, and stand contemptuously aloof, saying, <HI>I am holier than thou!</HI> Search your own hearts—search the Scriptures, and see if you stand unimpeached by the Ordeal.

grace never gives the spirit of persecution or uncharitableness—it is meekness, love, char∣ity and every social virtue; whilst unenlight∣ened by a divine spark, from the Rock of ages, the soul is immured in a baneful pris∣on; but touched with a coal from the sacred altar, all nature changes its appearance; like a bird which having escaped from its prison, conscious of having regained its liberty, tow∣ers aloft, and joyous skims through the cleav∣ing air—so the human soul when illuminated by the Spirit of grace.</P>
<P>THE necessity of regeneration or a change from above, is abundantly evident from rea∣son, as well as from revelation. A knowl∣edge of our evil and corrupt hearts ought to convince us of this—yet alas! unless awak∣ened by an invisible agency, we shall still re∣main in a maze of darkness. "Not all the angels in heaven, nor the doctors on earth, can convince us of this, till Christ shall be pleased to convince us that we are poor, frail, erring, vile and despicable creatures; sub∣jected to innumerable lapses and infirmities; sickness, passions and crosses; griefs, agonies and death—When this is effectually done, the whole of the business is done—We shall call for and catch at a Saviour, in the sensi∣bility of our want of him. When we come thus ladened with our sins to him, he will in no wise cast us out; but he will take us as Noah took the wearied dove into the ark; he will receive us within the vale of his own

<P>THE Almighty has been pleased to extend his afflicting arm over this city: yet he hath scourged us for our good. His chastisements are like that of a father to a beloved son, in order to reclaim, and turn him from the broad way of destruction. For though he causeth sorrow, yet he will have compassion, accord∣ing to the multitude of his tender mercies. Our crimes had provoked him, and he sent forth his ministers of wrath. We saw his correction—we beheld his frowns, and we ought to acknowledge his superintending care, with fear and trembling. Our God cannot rejoice in the sufferings of mortals, and he would not have created this life a vale of tears, were it not absolutely requisite that mortality should endure temporary evil, in order to be conducted into that world of un∣ceasing joy, where God will wipe all tears from our eyes. Therefore, God saw and commiserated our fallen, miserable state; he beheld, and by a kindly reverse, determined to turn all the evils of corrupt and fallen na∣ture to our endless benefit, and everduring felicity. He therefore in compassion for us, instituted disease, pain, affliction, distress and judgments, as monitors and ministers to ef∣fect our convictions of the depravity of our natures, and absolute need of a Saviour. This is the great end to be accomplished, and if we are so happy as to be warned by this

calamity, <HI>of our latter end—</HI> we shall have reason to rejoice throughout eternity, that we were thus afflicted. The bright Morning-Sar, the Lamb of God, slain from the foun∣dation of the world, will (upon our sincere repentance) be our portion forever. Then when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail of our frail mortal bodies is removed, we shall behold the "same blessed body, which for the redemption of commis∣erated sinners, went through the shameful and bloody process of scourges, thorns, spit∣tings and buffeting; which hung six agoniz∣ing hours on the cross; which descended in∣to the grave—even this body, shall shine forth in ineffable beauty and beatitude; in essentially communicative grace and glory; through the height, and through the depth, through the length and through the breadth, beaming wide beyond the universe, from in∣finity to infinity." Thus we shall behold him arrayed in glory, no more like the des∣pised God-man on earth. He will then wel∣come his faithful servants into celestial man∣sions of love and joy. Then you will rejoice with unspeakable complacency, that you have surmounted the barriers that opposed your progress, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> impeded your warfare; that you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ered from the rocks and quick-sands of a dangerous voyage through life, and escaped from the snares of the enemy of mankind.

FAITHFUL and persevering Christians are truly an ornament of society—they put forth the lustre of the Christian religion, and shine more conspicuous in a time of danger, and an hour of darkness—they prove the sincer∣ity of their professions, by their boldly suf∣fering in their Masters service—and enduring all things to render themselves more con∣formable to the image of their divine Master, who had not a place to lay his head. I should injure my own feelings should I neglect this opportunity, of publicly expressing my ap∣probation of the conduct of the Rev. Mr. Pilmore, through the whole course of the alarming contagion in this city. That intrepid fortitude and unvarying perseverance, which has so highly distinguished him, merits our respect and gratitude. His affectionate, fer∣vent and pathetic addresses from the desk, clearly evinces his concern for precious souls, and his resignation to the Divine will. Ever attentive to his abundant labors in the minis∣try, his activity and his extensive abilities, renders him a laborer that needs not to be ashamed. The envenomed tongue of envy and malevolence must shortly lie dumb and acknowledge the attractions of superior vir∣tue and religion.</P>
<P>PERSONS who have peculiarly felt the weight of the distressing season, by some af∣fecting bereavement; are thrice miserable if they are not brought to reflect seriously upon their own exit. For this purpose did God in

his love afflict you. Perhaps your affections were inordinately attached to your deceased relatives—it is possible that your God was neglected on the account. Now if you made the right application, two most important ends would be answered: that of detaching your thoughts from the creature, and directing them to the Creator, God blessed forever more! And by exhibiting mortality before you in the image of death, shows you as in a mirror, that you also are mortal, and must shortly follow. Again, the Almighty wounds but to heal more effectually, more savingly; and when you seem shrouded in a cloud of im∣penetrable darkness, and encompassed about with many sorrows, when all nature wears a lowring aspect, and the light of his coun∣tenance seems hid from you; he is then work∣ing greater things for you than you can con∣ceive: in short, he is preparing a crown of immortal glory for you. He is not more merciful in his favous than his punishments. Since it is evident that prosperity renders us fargetful of our benefactor; and adversity, by pointing out the instability of all created enjoyments: forces us to seek for more per∣manent possessions in the embraces of the great Bridegroom. He graciously interfered, and removed the stumbling blocks ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of your way, in order to draw you to that Rock of ages, whose habitation is without end, and whose glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fills immensity of space.

<P>THE late lamented and revered Licius and his amiable consort, long dived in connubial felicity, far transcending the lot commonly assigned to humanity. The soul of Licius was harmony—with the most amiable and tender sensibility, and formed highly suscept∣ible of tender and ennobling emotions. He was remarked, and estimated for his probity, undistinguished honesty, and undissembled sin∣cerity. Taught by his divine Master, he looked upon the great family of mankind with love, and exercised his talents in com∣forting, and aiding the indigent and distressed. His chief happiness however consisted in do∣mestic, innocent amusements. He loved his wise with the most ardent, though temperate passion; that is, his regards were not tumul∣tuous and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounding professions, but reduced to a calm and unruffled sunshine. She an∣swered his affection, and nothing appeared wanting for the completion of their happi∣ness on earth. Yet alas! vain, unstable, mu∣table state of transitory things! how short, and how uncertain are all created enjoyments! His avocations called him to a distant part of the continent; and he left his family after recommending them to the protection of their heavenly Father. Immediately after his de∣parture, the pestilential contagion made its appearance in the city. Licius received ac∣counts of the deadly malady; he prayed fer∣vently
<PB N="34" REF="025427_0033_0FCCE50497FB0DA8"/>
for the preservation of his partner and little ones; and left them in the hands of him who formed their mortal bodies. He how∣ever, accelerates his return, and with a mix∣ture of hope and fear; as he advanced to∣wards his habitation, he heard the sound of mourning and lamentation. And upon en∣tering the door, was met by a coffin and mourners—His daughter was no more—the prevailing contagion had cut her off, in the bloom of youth! He supported this sight with the fortitude that becomes a Christian; and hurried to see if his still dearer Naomi was safe—he hastened to her apartment; when, O heart-rending idea, the dear part∣ner of his life was laid upon her bed, pale and breathless—a lump of inanimate clay! Such a trial was for a moment too much for his gentle nature—his fortitude forsook him—his knees trembled beneath him—a death∣like paleness overspread his countenance, and he fell almost deprived of all sensation upon the floor—On recovering, the tears invol∣untarily streamed from his eyes, and his heart was rent with distressing convulsions—he cried out, she is gone!—the dear soother of my sorrows is gone!—never—never—more to return. Why, O why was life so pleasant, so delectable to me—it plunges me still deeper into exquisite misery! Yet what shall I say? forgive, O Father in heaven, forgive the repinings of thy poor afflicted servant—I will no more murmur, no more
<PB N="35" REF="025427_0034_0FCCE50632C792A0"/>
complain—Thy will, thy righteous will O God! be done.

<P>I AM fearful that those who were absent in the distressing season of our calamities; and did not observe the afflictions of mortality, will not be suitably impressed with the awful and mournful desolation; nor lay to heart, that judgments are sent to rouse the sleepy and secure. Let me intreat you Sirs, not to slight the admonition of a kind and gra∣cious God. Return not to rioting, revelling, and mispending that time which ought to be inestimably precious in your eyes, by employ∣ing it in securing your best interest, your glo∣ry and immortality! The precious light of his glorious countenance is now again beam∣ing upon us—The clouds are fast scattering, and health may soon again bless this city. But oh! avert a second judgment, which may prove more grievous than the first. Live like pil∣grims and strangers on earth—turn from the allurements of vice, and fly for assistance to the Rock of ages. Follow not the dulcet voice of the destructive Siren, which sound∣eth to allure, and allures but to destroy. Give no ground to the enemy of your souls; but trust in humble resignation upon him, who gives grace for grace. Sould you neglect so

great salvation, proffered to your free acceptance: should you despise his warnings, his invitations and providences—should neither his loving kindness nor his fierce judgments have any effect upon your hearts, grown obdurate a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hardened beyond expression, your condemnation will be just and equitable, you must stand speechless and dumb before the mercy seat. The lip of unimpeached justice must pronounce your doom—the Saviour that hung suspended on the cross for your salvation, even he, will change his smiles into an angry countenance of terror. And oh! how in∣conceivably dreadful will this exhibition appear, to the dismayed soul of the affrighted sinner—no ad∣vocate, no intercessor, the sweet, the mediatorial hour is past and all is darkness, terror and eternal death!—But oh! whilst the precious season of grace is still present, incessently supplicate and implore for pardon and reconciliation—The angels and the spi∣rits of just men made perfect will hail your return, from darkness to light, from misery to happiness consummate. When dislodged from this clayey taber∣nacle, when raised from the clod of the valley, glo∣ry and beautitude will burst upon us from the face of the once despised, though now exalted Emanuel! "The invisible Godhead will then become visible; the infinite, circumscribed; the unapproachable, ac∣cessable; and the incomprehensible, comprehended; within the humanity of the Prince of peace. Then will his cross be exalted for an ensign to the circling, bending, and worshiping universe; his wreath of thorns will kindle all nature with the dartings and castings forth of its corruscations, and his reed of mockery will become the sceptre of unlimited domi∣nation—Indissolubly united to the celestial choir, and rising from glory to glory, and a blessing rising on blessings, through an ever beginning to a never ending eternity!"</P>
