<Q><BIBL><HI>DANIEL IV.35.</HI></BIBL>
<P>—And He doth according to His Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Doctrine of universal Providence is believed and acknowledged by all (I suppose) who confess God to be the Creator of the World; and with very good Reason; for if he made it, it was doubt∣less for some wise Designs; and therefore it is necessary that he should govern it, that his Design in it may be accomplished.</P>
<P>The sacred Scriptures do every where instruct us to give God the Glory of his preserving and governing Providence, as well as his creating Power.</P>
<P>He that commanded the World into Being, has caused it to continue unto this Day. And as all Things are preserved by him; so he rules and governs them according to his Will. This Doctrine of the universal Dominion and Pro∣vidence of God is here laid down—<HI>He doth according to his Will, in the Army of Heaven,
<PB N="6" REF="009331_0004_1030EBF84BAC0D68"/>
and among the Inhabitants of the Earth</HI>—a Sub∣ject well worthy of our Contemplation; and not unseasonable at this Time.</P>
<P>The surprizing Turns of Providence, and the marvellous Things God has wrought for his People in the Course of the late War, which is now bro't to so happy and honourable a Con∣clusion, so interesting to us in this Land in particular, and which may with Propriety be commemorated on this Day and Occasion, have determined my Thoughts to this Subject. For <HI>he hath made his wonderful Works to be remem∣bered. He has shewed his People the Power of his Works, that he might give them the He∣ritage of the Heathen.</HI></P>
<P>Very apparently is the Government and Pro∣vidence of God seen in the Affairs of War; And not only is Success and Victory in Battle, but the bringing of a troublesome War to a comfortable and advantageous Issue, the Result of Providence, which Duty and Gratitude to the supreme Ruler of the World requires us to take Notice of, with Wonder and Thankfulness. <HI>He maketh Wars to cease to the End of the Earth,</HI> puts an End to the Wars of the Nations, which had turned the Earth into a Stage of bloody Confusion, and crowns them with Peace. And this he does <HI>that he may be exalted in the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>This great Truth is confirmed to us not only <HI>by rational Deductions</HI> (as may he shewn here∣after) but also by <HI>many Passages</HI> of the <HI>sacred Scriptures,</HI> and particularly by the Words be¦fore
<PB N="7" REF="009331_0005_1030EBFBD73AE258"/>
us. They were uttered by <HI>King Nebu∣chadnezzar,</HI> one of the most <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>absolute Monarchs</HI> of the World. The God of Heaven had given him a <HI>Kingdom,</HI> or <HI>Empire,</HI> abounding in <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Worldly Glories</HI>; and being fixed at the Top of worldly Honors and Greatness, he would also be <HI>absolute and uncontroulable in his Matters, and forgets that there is one above him.</HI> But God would have <HI>the living to know that the Most High ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Babylon</HI> and his Flatterers con∣ceited that he was <HI>God in Earth, independent, and unaccountable to any.</HI> Tho' he might have some Notion of <HI>a supreme God,</HI> yet he might also think, as some of the <HI>Heathen</HI> pretend to believe, that his Government was confined to Heaven: But the great God will have all Men to know that <HI>he rules on Earth too</HI>; that <HI>he sets up, and debases whom he pleases.</HI> And at last the <HI>ambitious King</HI> is bro't to acknowledge this to the Glory of God. For because he had lived a <HI>brutish sensual Life,</HI> and because he was in Heart lifted up above the <HI>common Race of Mankind</HI>; therefore he was driven from his magnificent <HI>Palace,</HI> and all <HI>Converse and Society with Men, to herd with Beasts, and graze with Oxen.</HI> By this strange Turn of Providence, God would teach him this <HI>Lesson,</HI> That he is the Giver of all Things; that even Princes are accountable to him; that their <HI>Tenure</HI> is at his Will alone; and that he can alter and alienate the Property of all Enjoyments, <HI>being himself the absolute Lord of all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009331_0006_1030EC0042F917D8"/>This in Conclusion is freely acknowledged. He who, at last, thought himself Supreme on Earth, <HI>blessed the Most High, and praised and honoured him that liveth for ever and ever, whose Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, and his Kingdom from Generation to Generation. And all the Inhabitants of the Earth are re∣puted as nothing: And he doth according to his Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>My Text then teaches us, <HI>That the glorious God exercises an actual Providence over all Things, according to his good Pleasure.</HI>—He is a great and a universal King; His <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Government over all Creatures</HI> is <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>unlimitted</HI>: His <HI>Right of Dominion</HI> cannot be disputed; and he <HI>actually</HI> governs and influen∣ces all Creatures as seemeth him good. He is the <HI>great Lord</HI> and <HI>Inspector</HI> of the Universe; and that not as an idle and unconcerned <HI>Spec∣tator</HI> of the <HI>Designs, Behaviour</HI> and <HI>Actions</HI> of created Beings; but he continually watches over them as their <HI>King, Possessor</HI> and <HI>Ruler,</HI> to lead and determine them to <HI>such Intentions and Ends</HI> as shall tend most to his Glory.— His Providential Care and Regard is exercised towards all; so that the End by him designed and appointed, shall infallibly be attained.— He doth <HI>according to his Will, every where, among all Creatures.</HI></P>
<P>There is no earthly Potentate that has so <HI>cer∣tainly, absolutely</HI> and <HI>intirely</HI> the Dominion over, or Disposal of any particular People, or Person,
<PB N="9" REF="009331_0007_1030EC01D7040B48"/>
as God has over all <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Things. For his is the Greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majesty: For all that is in the Heaven, and in the Earth is his; and his is the Kingdom, who is exalted as Head above all.</HI></P>
<P>That this important Truth may be set in a just Light, We shall endeavour
<LIST>
<ITEM>In the <HI>first Place,</HI> To shew what is implied in the Notion of a Providence, or what is intended when God is said to exercise a Providence over his Creatures.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> To consider the great and universal Extent of his Providential Care and Re∣gards. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Lastly,</HI> To enquire what reasonable Grounds we have to conclude that God actually exercises such a Providence.—</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I am to consider what is implied in the Notion of a Providence.—</P>
<P>God's exercising a Providence over his Crea∣tures, <HI>principally</HI> intends and implies in it these <HI>two Things</HI>: His <HI>sustaining and upholding Pow∣er, whereby the Creatures subsist, and are conti∣nued in actual Being</HI>; and his <HI>governing and disposing of all Things according to his Will.</HI></P>
<P>It is the <HI>latter of these</HI> that my Text more especially leads to the Consideration of.</P>
<P>God exercises his <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> to∣wards his Creatures, whereby they are <HI>supported</HI> and <HI>continued</HI> in their <HI>several distinct Orders.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="009331_0008_1030EC036731F368"/>
He does in his Providence continually preserve the Creation, and keep the several Parts of it <HI>in that Order of Being</HI> which he at first design∣ed to keep them in. All Creatures, of what <HI>Kind</HI> or <HI>Nature</HI> soever, are upheld in Being by a divine Power. They all live upon God, who is the Fountain of Life to all his Creatures; and therefore frequently styled, <HI>The living God.</HI></P>
<P>But he not only sustains and keeps his Crea∣tures in their Beings; but he always <HI>determines</HI> and <HI>orders</HI> them just as he pleases. He has an <HI>actual Influence</HI> over his Creatures, and <HI>governs</HI> them, and <HI>disposes</HI> of them <HI>as seemeth good in his Sight.</HI> He does, as it were, <HI>hold them all in his Hand;</HI> and they are more at his abso∣lute Pleasure and Disposal, than the meanest Worm is at ours. He is a most soverein Lord, and <HI>may,</HI> and <HI>actually does work all Things af∣ter the Council of his own Will</HI>: For he has made all Things for himself, and <HI>for his Plea∣sure they are and were created.</HI> The <HI>Potter</HI> has not more the <HI>Power over the Clay,</HI> than God has over his Creatures—</P>
<P>It is not only true that sovereign <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> belongs to God; but it is cer∣tain that he exercises such a Power. His Crea∣tures are intirely at his <HI>Will</HI>; tho' it be many Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> against <HI>their own</HI> that they are so. And let the reasonable, but sinful Creature, use all his <HI>Policy</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> after all, <HI>the Counsel of the Lord that shall stand.</HI>—He gives <HI>Liberty</HI> or <HI>Restraints, permits</HI> or <HI>with-holds</HI> as he sees meet.
<PB N="11" REF="009331_0009_1030EC0A79374B08"/>
There is no <HI>Event of Providence</HI> but what is according to his <HI>Sufferance</HI> or <HI>actual Disposal.</HI></P>
<P>The sovereign and all wise Providence of God <HI>steers, directs</HI> and <HI>marriages</HI> all <HI>Creatures</HI> and <HI>Things.</HI> As the whole Creation was made <HI>by Him</HI> and <HI>for Him,</HI> he will take Care and pow∣erfully dispose of all Things, so that the Honor of his <HI>holy Name</HI> shall in the End be vindicated and magnified. For this End he superintends his <HI>Creatures, their Actions</HI> and <HI>Concerns</HI>: and if he pleases, he will restrain, or even invert the natural Order of Things. He will <HI>make the Wisdom of the Wise Foolishness. The Battle shall not be to the Strong; nor Favour to Men of Skill.</HI> The <HI>Sun</HI> at his Command at one Time <HI>stands still,</HI> and at another <HI>takes an unnatural Course backwards.</HI> The Winds and Seas which are so impetuous, and one would think even Lawless, yet they stir not, nor breathe, but to fulfil his Word.</P>
<P>And his directive and influencing Providence is as certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Creatures when they act according to the general Laws of Nature, as when they act in Opposition thereto. For, as he certainly knows all their Designs, Incli∣nations, and Tendencies; so he can by his Pow∣er easily disappoint, curb and alter them.</P>
<P>Thus we see what is intended by the Provi∣dence of God: It is that Influence and Power of his, whereby he not only preserves and sus∣tains his Creatures, but governs, restrains and orders them as he pleases.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="009331_0010_1030EC0DA506CE38"/>It may be added here, without the Formality of a distinct Head, The Rule according to which he thus watches over, protects and dis∣poses of his Creatures, is his own Will "which is always directed by infinite Wisdom, and is the Rule of Goodness." <HI>He doth according to his Will</HI>—Nothing besides is or can be a Rule to him for the Government of the World. His sovereign Will is the alone Law by which all Creatures shall be ordered, determined and disposed. Because he is Lord of all, and be∣cause he is Supreme and Independent, therefore he is not accountable to any for any of his Matters. He may do whatever he pleases, <HI>in Heaven, in the Earth, and all deep Places, and none can stay his Hand, or may say, Wherefore hast Thou done thus?</HI></P>
<P>There can be nothing binding to God, nor any Thing that can influence him in any of his Operations out of himself, and beyond his own Will. His Wisdom, Justice and Holiness alone must determine what is holy, just and good, and so what is fit to be done in his Kingdom of Providence.</P>
<P>We may now pass on, and consider in the <HI>second Place,</HI> The great and universal Extent of God's Providential Care and Influence. <HI>He doth according to his Will, in the Army of Hea∣ven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth</HI>— He is the sole universal Monarch of the World. He is the great Lord and Governor of all Crea∣tures and Things, <HI>whether they be in Heaven, or on the Earth, visible or invisible.</HI> As all owe
<PB N="13" REF="009331_0011_1030EC0F353EA938"/>
their Existence to him; so they are all, without Exception, under his restraining, preserving and directing Power and Providence. He has <HI>pre∣pared his Throne in the Heavens:</HI> but <HI>his King∣dom ruleth over all.</HI> Tho' he manifests much more of his Glory and Excellency there; yet his Dominion is by no Means confined thereto, but it reaches to the utmost Bounds of the Creation. All Worlds and Creatures are abso∣lutely his: And were there as many more, they would be equally and rightfully under his Au∣thority and actual Government.</P>
<P>This might be more fully and clearly evinced by considering the several Ranks of Creatures, and Orders of Beings; all which are under the Providential Care and Power of God, and in his Word expresly said to be so—</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P>Good Angels are under the divine Providence and Government. They are the most excel∣lent and perfect Creatures; and yet are so far from being exempted from his Dominion, that none are more at his Will and Command than they. God exercised a special Act of Provi∣dence towards them, when he made them in their primitive Rectitude and Felicity. And after a sufficient Trial of their Obedience, did for the Praise of his glorious Grace, confirm them in a State of most perfect Blessedness for ever. This was an Act of sovereign Dominion and Providence in God; for they as Creatures are mutable and liable to fall from him, and to forfeit his Favour, as others who actually did apostatize.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="009331_0012_1030EC10CC4C54A8"/>And now they are intirely devoted to the di∣vine Will and Pleasure. They are readily, chear∣fully and constantly obedient to the Will of God. It is their Delight, and they account it, as indeed it is, their Glory and Honor to adore and worship God, and execute his Will. And God makes use of them as the Ministers of his Providence, and the Executioners of his Will in this lower World.— Again,</P>
<P>The evil Angels are under the powerful Re∣strains of divine Providence. Tho' they are apostatized from God, and cannot willingly yield themselves up to his good Pleasure, yet they are his and he will do with them whatsoever he plea∣ses, notwithstanding their high Opposition against him, and continual Endeavours to free them∣selves and others from any Subjection to his Authority and Will. When they had lost their original Integrity, and shewn themselves impla∣cable Enemies to God, his Glory and Dignity, he cast them out of Heaven, the Seat of the Blessed, and plunged them into the Pit of De∣struction and Misery. And tho' they have now an irreconcilable Enmity in their Natures against God, his Laws and Government; yet they can effect nothing against Him. He curbs and re∣strains them as he pleases. He holds them as in Chains, and they can go no further than the Limits by him prescribed. He is able, and does, as he pleases, pull down their strongest Holds. He binds the strong Man armed, and casts him out; destroys his usurped, unlawful Power over the Souls of Men. The Son of
<PB N="15" REF="009331_0013_1030EC19EADF20D0"/>
God when on Earth shewed such a divine Pow∣er in ejecting him from possessed Bodies; in not suffering him to speak, and in extorting from him a Confession that he was the Son of God.</P>
<P>Tho' evil Spirits are potent, politick, and nu∣merous, yet they can't controul divine Provi∣dence in the Designs of it. They cannot stay an Omnipotent Hand. They are securely re∣served in everlasting Chains under Darkness to the Judgment of the great Day. The Provi∣dence and Power of God watches over, and holds them in Horror and Misery. They are as condemned Malefactors, bound over to the last Judgment, when final Vengeance shall come upon them. And even now their evil De∣sires and mischievous Designs are restrained by a superior Power.</P>
<P>Furthermore,</P>
<P>God exercises his absolute Dominion and sovereign Providence over Men on Earth. The Affairs of the World in general are ordered and determined by Him. His is the King∣dom, and he is the Governor among the Nati∣ons. His Eyes are in every Place, and he ob∣serves all Things with the most perfect, exact and critical View. And he has an actual In∣fluence in all human Affairs and Concerns.</P>
<P>Particular Nations and Kingdoms are under his Care and providential Rule, and the Civil, Military and Secular, as well as religious and spiritual Interests of a People are either oppos∣ed and lost, or established and promoted accord∣ing to his Permission and Will.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009331_0014_1030EC1B79D684C0"/>He puts the Administration of Government into what Hands he pleases; for all the sub∣ordinate Powers that be are ordained of God, or at least suffered by him. <HI>Promotion cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South, but God is the Judge, he put∣teth down one, and setteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>The Kingdoms and Dominions of the World are his, and he giveth them to whom he will. All humane Power is derived from him, whose Power and Authority is universal, infinite and adorable. The greatest Potentates of the Earth, who have been ready to imagine themselves sovereign and independent, are nevertheless un∣der his powerful Influence, and are by him made to subserve his Interest and Glory, when their very Design was to contradict and oppose it. That proud and potent King of <HI>Babylon, whose Greatness reached unto Heaven, and his Dominion to the End of the Earth; all Nati∣ons trembled before Him; whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive;</HI> yet even he, this Child of Pride, is made to con∣fess one higher than himself, and to bow be∣fore him.</P>
<P>And this is what every one shall finally be made to do. For, the most High actually rules in the Kingdoms of this World, and determines the Concerns of particular States and People, according to his own Will and Wisdom. <HI>He stands in the Congregation of the Mighty, and judges among the Gods.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009331_0015_1030EC1D119F0C20"/>Suffer me particularly to observe here, that whatever the Circumstances of a Person of Peo∣ple are, they are put into such Circumstances either in the Course of God's common Provi∣dence, or by some unusual Events. For God has the ordering and government both of na∣tural and accidental Causes and Events.</P>
<P>Hardly any Thing happens to Men, in the ordinary Course of their Lives, but what, if heed∣fully attended to, may teach them that there is a wise, just and good Providence, which directs and manages those natural Things, which are the immediate Causes of their Prosperity, or of their Sorrow and Distress.</P>
<P>God does in some Measure govern the Moral, by the World of Nature. He rewards or pu∣nishes Men by a wholesome or pestilential Air; by fruitful or barren Seasons. He hinders or promotes their Designs by Wind and Weather; by a backward or forward Spring. He makes Nature give Laws to Men, and set Bounds to their Passions and Intrigues. How often does he by natural Causes, overthrow powerful Fleets and Armies, defeat the wisest Counsels, arbitrate the Differences of Princes, and decide the Fate of Kingdoms! Now if God thus go∣verns Men by Nature, he must govern Nature too. For necessary cannot be suited to the Designs and Endeavours of free Agents, with∣out the Influence of a wise Providence.</P>
<P>God also has the Government of accidental Causes and Events. The outward Peace and Comfort, or Misery of Men, of Families, and
<PB N="18" REF="009331_0016_1030EC244AE346F8"/>
sometimes of whole Kingdoms, depends upon something accidental. So that if God did not rule such Things, some of the greatest and most remarkable Changes in the World, would be excepted from his Care and Providence.</P>
<P>Men lay their Schemes as well as they can, and Providence seems to favour them too; but by some secret Cause, their Devices are all dis∣appointed, and their Counsels carried headlong—</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the most unlikely Means shall sometimes attain the End. A People shall be raised to worldly Glories by a surprizing Course of Events, as accidental as they are pros∣perous. Does not some wonderful Turn of Providence sometimes highly favour Men, even contrary to all human Probability?</P>
<P>Again, Some casual Occurrences frustrate the most proper Means, and give an unexpected Turn to the Interests of Men. What should conquer in a Race, but Swiftness? What should win the Battle, but Strength, and Valor, and Marshal Skill? What should supply Men's wants, and get Riches, but Understanding and Dili∣gence in human Affairs? What more likely Way to gain the Favour of others, than a skil∣ful Address? Yet the wise Man observed in his Days, and the Observation holds good still, that it is not always thus; <HI>Time and Chance hap∣peneth to all</HI>—Some favourable Juncture, and unseen Accidents are more effectual than all human Strength, Art or Discretion.</P>
<P>Now, however fortuitously Things may hap∣pen, they are brought to pass by a divine Effici∣ency; and there is some wise Design in them.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="009331_0017_1030EC2800005208"/>Many Things befall us which we never looked for, and could not foresee. These are what we call Contingencies, or Accidents. But with Respect to God, there can be no such Thing as Chance. For as he foreknows those Events, which to us are most uncertain and sur∣prising; so he actually governs them.</P>
<P>But I may not enlarge.</P>
<P>The various Successions of Peace and War, War and Peace are from Him. The Desola∣tions of War, and the Blessings of Peace are ordered by Him. War is the Sword of the Lord, which he draws and sheaths again at his Pleasure. When he sees fit he disturbs the Re∣pose of the Nations, and calls opposing Armies into the Field of Battle, where clashing Swords, and Garments rolled in Blood, open a most distressing and melancholly Scene.—And then, when the War has accomplished that for which it was sent, he composes the Belligerent Powers to Peace,
<Q>calls off the Nations from opposing and destroying one another, and disbands the most furious Armies.</Q></P>
<P>It must indeed be allowed that War origi∣nates in the Lusts of Men, and Princes; and that their Pride, Envy, Covetousness, Affectation of undue Dominion, &amp;c. are the secondary Causes of its Rise; and all the Horrors that attend it.—Nevertheless there is an over-ruling Hand of Providence, disposing and ordering the exact Time of its Beginning, Continuance, and Conclusion—as well as the great and im∣portant Events of it.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="009331_0018_1030EC2B22025450"/>Moreover,</P>
<P>God in his Providence cares, provides for, and governs particular Persons. Tho' the uni∣versal World be under his constant Inspection, yet no particular Soul is neglected by him. He has as much Respect to every individual Person, as to the greatest Man upon Earth, or the World in general. So unsearchable is the Wis∣dom of God, and so unlimited his Power, as that he can and actually does know the State of every Man, and rules and governs him ac∣cordingly.—</P>
<P>All Men, both Good and Bad, are particu∣larly respected by him, and either succeeded or blasted in their Enterprizes, according to his Will. Yea,</P>
<P>He has an Influence into the particular Ac∣tions of particular Persons. Every good Action is performed by his efficacious Power, and the immediate Assistance of his Grace.</P>
<P>And even evil Actions are done by his spe∣cial Permission. He suffers them to be per∣formed, and yet, by his Providence, so directs and over-rules them, as that they will in the Con∣clusion make for his own Glory.</P>
<P>In a Word,</P>
<P>The Providence of God extends itself to the meane<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and most inconsiderable Creatures. They are not without the Limits of divine Pro∣vidence and Care. Yea, the very Hairs of our Head are all numbred by him. Divine Provi∣dence reaches to the most minute Things, and influences the most invaluable Beings in the
<PB N="21" REF="009331_0019_1030EC2CD9414560"/>
World. In short, it reaches to the utmost Bounds of the Creation, and extends to all Things.</P>
<P>We hasten now in the third and last Place, to consider what reasonable Grounds we have to conclude, that God does actually exercise such a Providence.</P>
<P>It is certain we have sufficient Grounds of Assurance to found our Belief upon, even from the frequent and express Testimony of the Word of God. He is there said to be an in∣finite and an all-comprehending Being. All Power, and Might and Dominion is ascribed to him. <HI>His Name is excellent in all the Earth; his Glory is above the Heavens. Of him, and thro' him, and to him▪ are all Things.</HI> He is the great and mighty God. The Lord of Hosts is his Name. Great in Counsel, and mighty in working. The God of the Spirits of all Flesh, and nothing is too hard for him. <HI>He forms the Light, and he creates Darkness: he makes Peace, and creates Evil; the Lord does all these Things. To whom can we liken him, for he is God: his Counsel shall stand, and he will do all his Pleasure. He alone is God, and there is none with him. He kills and he makes alive; he wounds and he heals▪ neither is there any that can deliver out of his Hand.</HI></P>
<P>It were easy, but it is needless to multiply Texts of this Nature and Import, wherein the Excellency, and Majesty, the Greatness and Glory, the Sovereignty and Providence of God are asserted, and set forth, in the best Manner that Words of human Eloquence will allow.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="009331_0020_1030EC2E69621208"/>There are further many rational Grounds to believe the all-disposing Providence of God.</P>
<P>As his eternal Godhead, almighty Power▪ and infinite Wisdom, are manifested to his rational and intelligent Creatures; so they may also rea∣sonably infer his active Providence and conti∣nually influencing Power over all the Works of his Hands. There is just Reason to believe that God rules and governs all his Creatures, and all their Actions.</P>
<P>This may be argued from his creating all Things for himself. That God is the Maker of all Things, is as true as that he is God. For except we allow him to be the original Cause, the Creator and Former of all Things, we shall by Consequence deny him to be the only self-existing, and independent Being. If any Thing could exist and act without him, then he is not the all-perfect Being: and so not truly God.</P>
<P>It therefore must, and easily will be granted, that in the Beginning God made the Heavens and the Earth; and that without him was not any Thing made that was made; that all with∣in the Limits of the Creation, from the most glorious Angel to the meanest Insect; yea, to the least Atom of Dust, was commanded into Being by his all-powerful Word.</P>
<P>And as all Things were made by him, so for him. He hath made all Things for himself. His own Glory was the principal and last End in all his Works of Creation. In whatever God does, his only Rule is his own Will, and his End is the Manifestation of his glorious Excellencies.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="009331_0021_1030EC38B71ED318"/>Now, see if this Consideration will not ne∣cessarily infer his providential Rule and Govern∣ment over all Things? Can any Man believe God the Creator of all Things, and acknow∣ledge, as every one must do, that he made all for himself; and yet disbelieve his actual Power and Providence over all? It cannot certainly be beneath the Majesty of God to regard and take Care of the meanest Creatures, since it was not unworthy of him to exert his almighty Power in giving them Being at first. And it must certainly be inconsistent with the Wisdom of God to create such a Variety of Beings for his own Glory, and then intirely desert them, and take no Care that the End were actually attained.</P>
<P>We may be assured, that since God made all Things for the Display of his glorious Per∣fections in them, he will so restrain, direct and influence them, as that this End shall certainly be secured.</P>
<P>If God be the Maker of all Things, and his own Honor was his End therein; then he is the Lord and sovereign Disposer of all. This is a plain and undeniable Consequence.</P>
<P>Nor is it any reasonable Objection against this, that a Multitude of the most excellent Crea∣tures, Angels and Men, have fallen from their original State of Perfection, and are now be∣come unwilling and unable actively to glorify God. For he by his Power can, and in his Providence actually does so over-rule them and their Actions, as that the great End shall be ob∣tained. For <HI>God will be glorified in them that
<PB N="24" REF="009331_0022_1030EC3A9A916C10"/>
perish, as well as in them that are saved</HI>—</P>
<P>I shall only add,</P>
<P>A divine Providence may be argued from Miracles, or Works above the Power of natu∣ral Agents. Those Operations and Events which exceed the meer Force and Power of Nature, will necessarily infer some superior and most powerful Being, who interposes when he pleases, and hinders or inverts the natural Course and Tendency of the Creatures.</P>
<P>That there have been such extraordinary Works or Events, we have all possible Reason to believe. He that will n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> give his Assent to the Truth of such Facts, because he was never an Eye-witness of them, may, as well, and with as much Reason, resolve to believe nothing at all, but what he has had a Personal Knowledge of.</P>
<P>Allowing then that there have been such mi∣raculous Works as never could have been effec∣ted but by a divine Power, We may be assured that God exercises a sovereign Power and Pro∣vidence over the World; that he acts his Will and Pleasure among all Creatures; that he per∣mits them to act, or obstructs and hinders ac∣cording to his Will. If he did not watch over and govern the World, to what can we impute those wonderful and miraculous Things which we find recorded in the Scriptures of Truth? They were manifestly contrary to the known established Laws of Nature. And it would be unreasonable to suppose that they were effected by evil, but powerful Spirits, to put a Cheat up∣on Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="009331_0023_1030EC3C30D845C0"/>The manifest Design of them was to glorify God, and to promote the Holiness and Hap∣piness of Men. They must therefore be wro't by the Finger of God; and they prove his Power and Providence over his Creatures—</P>
<P>The Truth under Consideration might be further evidenced from God's frequent restrain∣ing and subduing the Lusts of Men. These are so many Miracles of Grace, and so many Evidences of God's adorable Power, and sove∣reign Providence. For if some Almighty Hand did not continually hold in, and restrain the inordinate Lusts of Men and Devils, this World would, before now, have been an Habitation of Cruelty, and a mere Hell of Confusion and Misery.</P>
<P>What we have now heard under this Head, without further insisting upon it, may give us a rational Conviction of the Truth we have been considering, viz. That God exercises a power∣ful Providence over all his Creatures, according to his Will.</P>
<P>And now, from what has been offered, let us in the first Place learn to adore the infinite Majesty and Greatness of God.</P>
<P>How excellent, great, and glorious a Being is he, who thus rules, disposes, and governs all Things! What an exalted Idea does this give us of the divine Majesty, to think that he is a King, absolutely Sovereign, universal and eternal! Of how glorious and adorable Per∣fections must that God be; and with how glo∣rious a Majesty must he be cloathed, who can
<PB N="26" REF="009331_0024_1030EC3FBAB41380"/>
thus inspect and order the Universe as he pleases!</P>
<P>What Authority and Power is he invested with, whose is the Heavens, and the Earth, and all that therein is, and who has all Crea∣tures at his sole Command, and intire Disposal! How great a God is he! How greatly to be feared and had in Reverence!</P>
<P>He must needs be entitled to all Honor and Worship, who has a necessary and indisputable Right of Dominion over all. He who is Lord of all, is worthy to receive all Blessing and Glory from all Creatures, according to their several Abilities. It is the obliged Duty of all his reasonable Creatures to adore him and mag∣nify his Name, who is the exalted King and Head over all.</P>
<P>Earthly Princes and Governors will be res∣pected, honoured and obeyed by those who are lawfully subjected to their Authority. And by how much they exceed in Health and world∣ly Glories, and in the extent of their Dominions, a proportionably greater Honor will be chal∣lenged by them. The Respect and Honor which is paid them rises in Proportion to their outward Magnificence and worldly Greatness.</P>
<P>What Glory, Adoration and Praise then is due to God, the universal King and Governor, whose Authority and Power is most just and rightful; and who has all Things at his Will and good Pleasure? We have all possible Reason to make him the highest Object of our Esteem, Fear and Reverence. Shall not the Excellency of so glorious a Being make us afraid▪ Shall
<PB N="27" REF="009331_0025_1030EC4665EAF860"/>
not a holy Awe and Dread of the almighty King fall upon us? Shall a finite Creature, to whom is given some worldly Power, be regarded and reverenced by us; and shall not the infinite God, who has all Power and Authority, be much more so? It is only for the Sake of that derived Power wherewith Earthly Rulers are invested, that we honor and obey them? Does not therefore God, the infinite Original of all Authority, Might and Power, much more chal∣lenge our Fear, Adoration and humble Obedi∣ence▪ Should not the Consideration of that sovereign Dominion, that boundless Power, and all-governing Authority of God, strike us into an holy Fear and Trembling, at the infinite aw∣ful and terrible Majesty that is with him?</P>
<P>How glorious is God our heavenly King! And how reveren<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial, humble and obedient should we be to a Being, great and powerful as he is! He justly demands, and it is our reason∣able Duty, to pay all Worship, Homage and Praise to him, who is all in all; who by an underived Authority, and an irresistible Power, over-rules all Creatures for his own Glory.</P>
<P>That which naturally flows from this Doc∣trine, is that of the inspired Psalmist, <HI>O come, let us worship, and bow down!</HI> We should en∣tertain high and honourable Thoughts of him▪ and fall low before the high and lofty One—</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Let what has been said excite us to a serious Contemplation on God's Works of Providence, and to give him the Glory of his Wisdom, Power, Goodness, and other Ex∣cellencies
<PB N="28" REF="009331_0026_1030EC47F51395E0"/>
that are therein manifested. This is one main Business of our present State, as we are understanding and thoughtful Creatures. And it is no improbable Opinion that some Part of our Employment in Heaven will be to contemplate the Works of God, as well as his eternal Essence, and to render him the Praise which results from both.</P>
<P>As the Glory of God is visible in the Cre∣ation of the World, so he makes known his Wisdom and Goodness, his Power, Justice and Mercy in the Government of it. The Word of God (as we have heard) teaches us to be∣lieve that all Creatures are preserved and govern∣ed by the same almighty Hand which at first gave them Being. That he by whom they at first existed keeps them in their several Orders, Operations and Motions, and that nothing hap∣pens either in the common Course of Nature, or in extraordinary Events without his Know∣ledge and Determination. In a Word, that he is ever present with all his Creatures, and that even the most inconsiderable of them are not excepted out of his Dominion and Government. It is the Duty of reasonable Creatures to live under a due Sense of this Providence. Nor is it enough that we retain the general Notion and Belief of it in our Minds, but should take Care to apply it to particular Events. For if God knows and orders every Thing that hap∣pens to ourselves and others, to Nations and Kingdoms, it must be the Duty of his People to acknowledge him in all.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="009331_0027_1030EC4987F26C80"/>We should often meditate, with suitable Af∣fections, on the glorious Instances of his Pow∣er, his Goodness, and his Grace, his unsearch∣able Wisdom, and his Truth and Righteousness, which appear in the Administration of his Go∣vernment of rational Beings.</P>
<P>The Dispersions of Nations over the Face of the Earth, the Rise of Empires, and the Fate of Kingdoms, as to outward Circumstances or spi∣ritual Privileges, are according to the Appoint∣ment of God, and the Influence of his Power.</P>
<P>We should particularly reflect with Grati∣tude upon the many signal Events of Provi∣dence, in God's Protection of his own People; his defeating the Designs of their Enemies; and the many wonderful Salvations and Favours which he has granted to them.</P>
<P>Gratitude to God for favourable Dispensati∣ons of Providence, is so rational a Duty, that they who regard nothing but their precious En∣joyments, without any serious Remembrance of God, are, not only lost to all Sense of Religion, but even to the most reasonable Apprehensions and Affections of human Nature.</P>
<P>Let us then ascribe the Glory of all the Sal∣vations and Deliverences, which the Church and People of God have had Experience of, from Time to Time, to him who doth according to his Will, in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth. It is he that has saved and defended them from their Enemies, and disappointed their Devices against them. He is the supreme Cause and Author of all those
<PB N="30" REF="009331_0028_1030EC4CABC2F120"/>
glorious Works which are wro't for the Church∣es Salvation.</P>
<P>Instruments are indeed to be honored as In∣struments whom God makes use of in subdu∣ing the Church's Enemies; but God is to be acknowledged as the sole Author of all Salva∣tions. It is he that raises up Instruments: it is he that qualifies and sits them for any Services and it is he that does all by them, and there∣fore to his Name alone is all the Glory due.</P>
<P>Let our Souls then magnify the Lord, who hath done great Things for his People. Let us lift up his Name on high, and sacrifice Praise to him, who alone doth wondrous Things.</P>
<P>Let me here adopt some of the Expressions of another. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. <HI>Foxcroft</HI>'s Sermon on <HI>Psalm.</HI> 15 7. on Occasion of the Death of King <HI>George</HI> the First, and the Accession of King <HI>George</HI> the Second, to the British Throne.</NOTE></P>
<P>God has pleaded the Cause of his People, and upheld his Church amidst innumerable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Wars, Persecutions and Oppressions. The Lord is great in Zion, and he ruleth in the midst of his Enemies.</P>
<P>What an admirable Train of glorious Deli∣verances did the Lord give his People in old Time to experience▪ The whole Story of the Jews is brightned with very numerous and most surprizing Memorials. And the Conduct of Providence towards the Christian Church, both in the primitive Ages, and latter Times, has been almost equally full of Wonders.</P>
<P>The English Nation in particular, has been the Stage of many the most remarkable Dispen∣sations.
<PB N="31" REF="009331_0029_1030EC55AE7F2708"/>
—By what marvellous Methods of Pro∣vidence was the Reformation from Popery ac∣complished. And how has this glorious In∣terest been signally guarded by an amazing Series of special Interpositions to this Day▪ It hath passed thro' many a hazardous Crisis, and been reduced to an expiring Posture Time after Time: but has received new Life▪ and been made to flourish again by some happy Turn of Affairs, so sudden and unaccountable, that the Finger of God hath visibly appeared, its Ene∣mies themselves being judges.</P>
<P>And to come to this Land: how very re∣markable have been the Operations of a special Providence towards this People, from the Be∣ginning down to this Day!</P>
<P>The great Actions and Specialties of Provi∣dence in Favor of the People of God here, have been many and astonishing, and afford Materials for as entertaining and affecting a Story as any Place in the whole World, in the same Compass of Time, can furnish out. For whether we reflect on the Beginning and Rise, or Continuance and Progress of these Plantati∣ons, that were begun upon a religious Foun∣dation, which you will allow me to say is the special Honor of New-England. We are on all Sides presented with wonderful Displays of the saving Power, directing Wisdom, beneficent Goodness, and unfalling Truth of our Cove∣nant-God.—Let me add▪—</P>
<P>We have in particular been wonderfully saved from our Enemies, when, to all human
<PB N="32" REF="009331_0030_1030EC5746FC0A48"/>
Appearance, they might have easily, had they been permitted, swallowed us up, and made a Prey of us.—</P>
<P>If we come down to the late War, which very much originated in Disputes relative to <HI>North-America:</HI> how marvellous and affecting have been the Appearances of Providence for us.</P>
<P>At the opening of it, when thro' the Perfi∣diousness of our Enemies, we were obliged in our own Defence, to have Recourse to Arms, they had almost surrounded us by Land, with a Line of Forts; had some of the best Troops in <HI>France</HI> sent to their Assistance, and had en∣gaged vast Numbers of the native Savages in their Interests; and were big with Hopes of driving us from the Inheritance derived to us from our Fathers, and obtained thro' a World of Peril▪ Toil and Hardship▪ and at the Expence of much Blood and Treasure.—But <HI>blessed be God who hath not given us a Prey to their Teeth: our Soul is escaped as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowlers▪ the Snare is broken, and we are escaped.</HI></P>
<P>Several Times▪ at first, our military Affairs were under a Cloud, and presented us with gloomy Prospects. But at length they took another Turn, and became prosperous, even beyond our Expectation, and most sanguine Wishes. Providence awaked on our Behalf, and by one Conquest after another, has sub∣jected the extended Country of <HI>Canada</HI> to the British Empire, whereby we are delivered from
<PB N="33" REF="009331_0031_1030EC58D7AC12E8"/>
the Hands of our ancient and inveterate Ene∣mies, who had from the Beginning been Scour∣ges in our Sides, and upon all Occasions vexa∣tious to us; always contriving our Ruin, and exciting the Savages of the Wilderness, ever delighting in Blood and Mischief, thro' deep rooted Prejudices against us, to numberless in∣human Murders, and Depredations, on our in∣fant Settlements.</P>
<P>Let us then <HI>Praise the Lord with our whole Hearts, and shew forth all his marvellous Works. Let us be glad and rejoice in him, who has main∣tained our Right and our Cause, and who sat in the Throne judging Right—He has not suffered them who were our Enemies wrongfully to re∣joice over us, and them that hated us without a Cause—He hath stirred up himself and awaked to our Judgment, even to our Cause.</HI>—</P>
<P>And now after a surprizing and almost un∣parrelled Series of Victories and Successes, with which divine Providence has crowned the British Fleets and Armies in all Parts of the World, our Enemies have been brought to submit to honourable Terms of Peace, and particularly advantageous, comfortable and happy to these Colonies.—This great Event reflects a Lustre on his Majesty's Crown and Arms, and adorns the Beginning of his Reign; which it is our ardent Wish and Prayer may be very long and glori∣ous—and that <HI>in his Days the Righteous may flourish, and Abundance of Peace.</HI>—</P>
<P>It was an happy Period with God's ancient People, when it was said of their new conquer∣ed
<PB N="34" REF="009331_0032_1030EC5A683332E0"/>
Country, The Land rested from War. And blessed be God that such a joyful Aera now shines forth upon us in <HI>America;</HI> and that we may <HI>sit every Man under his Vine and under his Figtree, having none to make us afraid</HI>—or to disturb us in the Enjoyment either of the Fruits of the Earth, or our more precious and distin∣guishing Privileges, both of a Religious and Civil Nature.</P>
<P>But is War bro't to an happy Conclusion? And do the Blessings of Peace smile around us? Shall we therefore now <HI>beat our Swords into Plowshares, and our Spears into Pruning Hooks</HI>; and lay aside our military Weapons as useless Things, which we shall never more have Occa∣sion for, and give up all Endeavours to be ac∣quainted with the Art of War, and to keep up a martial Spirit?—How impolitic; how unsafe; how dishonorable such a Conduct! Who knows how soon he that hath stilled the Tumult of the People at present, may again call to Arms? We cannot but remember that it was but a few Years after the late Peace in 1748 was established, and the Flames of War extinguished, before they broke out again.</P>
<P>The Church's Enemies are ever restless; and tho' God is above all the Enemies of his Peo∣ple, and is able to curb their Power and restrain their Malice;—yet have we not Reason to fear that the abounding of Iniquity in the Protestant World, may provoke God soon again to chastize his People with the Punishment of the Sword.</P>
<P>Is it not the Wisdom of a People to be al∣ways in a Posture of Defence?</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="009331_0033_1030EC5D8EFDFF58"/>Among the various Changes of human Af∣fairs, the different and opposite Events that do interchangeably succeed in the Course of human Life, for which the Royal Preacher tells us, There is a Time and Season, those that do more eminently affect Nations and Kingdoms are a Time of War, and a Time of Peace. These take their Turns in their appointed Seasons, which is (as one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> in his Artillery Election Sermon 173<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> observes) an Admonition to us, that as War must be managed with Views of Peace, so a Time of Peace must be improv∣ed to prepare for War.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> the wisest of Men and Monarchs, tho' in his Days such a Peace flourished▪ that it is said, there was <HI>no Adversary or evil Oc∣current,</HI> yet who made greater Preparation for War than he? And the Scripture speaks of it to his Commendation.</P>
<P>Skilful and brave Soldiers are ever the Beau∣ty and Glory, and under God, the Safety and Defence of a People.</P>
<P>And I may be allowed on this Occasion par∣ticularly to say that the Gentlemen of the <HI>ancient and honourable Company of the Artillery,</HI> should be encouraged in their Endeavours to keep up a martial Spirit, and to acquire and propagate Skill and Expertness in the Use of Arms. And we trust they are so, and will be so by <HI>His Excellency</HI> the <HI>Captain-General,</HI> by the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>General Assembly</HI> and by all that wish well to the real Interests of this People.—</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="009331_0034_1030EC64E51827A0"/>His EXCELLENCY, and our other honoured Rulers, who are pleased to grace these Anniver∣saries with their Presence, and Attendance on the Exercises of divine Service, usual on such Days, surely, do hereby signify their Approba∣tion of the Design of the Institution of this Company, as valuable, and of real Benefit to the Community.</P>
<P>Our Fathers who laid the Foundation of this Establishment, tho't it of Importance. Nor will it be an Argument of our superior Wis∣dom to dissert the Cause they were so anxious to support.</P>
<P>Have we not seen the Importance of well disciplined Troops in the late War? And shall we that have known the great Utility and Ne∣cessity of expert and valiant Soldiers, not be concerned to have such found among ourselves, who might be able to force regular Forces upon equal Grounds, and not be afraid to speak with the Enemy in the Gate?</P>
<P>Well accomplish'd and skilful Soldiers will be more than ever necessary for us in any future War that may arise, as such will be those, in all Probability, whom we shall chiefly have to deal with.—</P>
<P>As the Establishment of Peace upon such glorious Terms cannot but diffuse Joy thro' the Minds of all that wish well to Zion, and are the real Friends of the Protestant Cause▪ so we all bear our Part in grateful Acknowledgments to the supreme Disposer of all Events, who hath the Hearts of the Princes and Potentates

of the Earth in his Hand, for this gracious Dispensation, so much in Favour to the British Governments in <HI>America,</HI> and to this Province in particular.</P>
<P>Nevertheless it becomes us all, and Persons of a military Character will especially remem∣ber, that the Time may come even in our Days, such is the Instability of human Affairs, when those who envy our growing Greatness, may form deep Plots against us, and endeavour to put them in Execution by the Point of the Sword. Is it not then our Wisdom even in a Time of Peace to prepare for War, and cherish a martial Spirit, that we may be in a ready Posture of Defence on the Turn of Affairs?</P>
<P>Altho' the peculiar Smiles of Providence which attend this anniversary Solemnity, inspire Joy and Gratitude into all our Hearts, yet we feel our Sorrow and Mourning renewed for the Decease of the late worthy Colonel PHILLIPS, who was so long an Ornament to the <HI>Artillery Company,</HI> as well as a great Blessing in the other various public Stations which he filled with Honor, Fidelity and Acceptance. But he is gone! Gone to be here no more! His Piety, Integrity, Benevolence, and extensive Kindness and Goodness, afforded him solid Comfort at the Approach of the last Enemy, and Victory over him. He quitted the Field of Battle with Honor; and we doubt not knows by happy Experience the Import of that gracious Procla∣mation and Promise of our divine Commander, <HI>To him that overcometh will I grant to set with
<PB N="38" REF="009331_0036_1030EC6A93C54780"/>
me on my Throne, even as I also overcame and am set down with my Father on his Throne.</HI></P>
<P>We, my Brethren, must ere long engage in the same Combat, <HI>for there is no Discharge in that War;</HI> and the Body will fall and die in the Conflict, and Death feed on its prostrate Prey in the Grave.</P>
<P>May we, may all in this Assembly of what∣ever Character and Condition in Life, be con∣cerned that we may be prepared for this last Scene of Life, and the Beginning of a new, and never-ending State. This is the chief Bu∣siness of Life, which if neglected we are eter∣nally ruined. To this End let us believe in the LORD JESUS CHRIST, fly for Refuge to his atoning Sacrifice, submit to him as the Lord our Righteousness, yield Obedience to his Com∣mands as the Captain of our Salvation, and live in the faithful Discharge of the Duties of our several Stations.</P>
<P>Let us look to him, <HI>in whom it hath pleased the Father that all Fulness should dwell,</HI> for Grace and Strength to enable us to prosecute our Christian Warfare amidst our surrounding and powerful Enemies, with Courage and Reso∣lution, and to push on with Patience and Bra∣very to the final Conquest; that when our War∣fare shall be accomplished, and Death shall dis∣charge us from the Fatigues and Turmoils of this transitory Life, we may put on the Garland of Immortality, and live and reign with our victorious Redeemer, in the Realms of a glori∣ous and undisturbed Peace, thro' the endless Ages of Eternity. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
