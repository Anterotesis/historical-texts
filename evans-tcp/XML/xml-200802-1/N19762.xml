<HEAD>A SERIOUS EXPOSTULATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN the American Daily Advertiser, and other public papers, are inserted Debates of the House of Representatives of the United States, on the 28th of November last, some speeches or animad∣versions of two or three of the southern delegates, on the presentation of what is there stiled "a pa∣per purporting to be a memorial respecting the abo∣lition of slavery, which in the opinion of the said delegates, and divers others, was declared to be an application unconstitutional, and of mischievous consequences, as it would only tend to render the Negroes unhappy, and excite them to insurrections in those states where they were most necessary to be retained; and that even the publication of a <HI>fanatical memorial</HI> in the news-papers, might have a fatal effect in disturbing the present excellent har∣mony of the union; for the people of the southern states may be led thereby to suppose, that this me∣morial is before Congress, and will be discussed dur∣ing the present session, it is therefore the more ne∣cessary
<PB N="4" REF="025821_0003_0FCEF044E2C20E58"/>
to undeceive them, by publishing the con∣trary, and by expunging the entry from the jour∣nals."</P>
<P>Having believed it my religious duty to address that memorial to Congress, and that in so doing, I was really influenced by the Catholic principle of uni∣versal good-will to men, and sincerely desirous of promoting that <HI>excellent harmony and union,</HI> which is founded on the solid basis of impartial liberty and common right, I may acknowledge it is far from being a matter of indifference to me to find, in the above-cited publication, so little regard paid to this great fundamental of the public weal; by men chosen and entrusted to fill a station so very im∣portant, who ought and may be supposed, on a subject of so interesting and extensive concernment, to speak their real sentiments, unbiassed by any sinister purpose; I have been therefore led I trust, by the same disinterested and Christian motive, which induced me to make the application in ques∣tion, to enter into a close self-examination and reconsideration of the tenor of my said memorial, left through an unguarded warmth of zeal, I might have given occasion to those not well-affected to that divine precept and perfect rule of universal equity, enjoined by the highest authority, <HI>whatso∣ever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so unto them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii.31.</NOTE>—to stamp the righteous and liberal aim and design of my memorial, with the oppro∣brious stigma of <HI>fanaticism</HI>; and as far as I have
<PB N="5" REF="025821_0004_0FCEF056F4099C08"/>
been capable of an impartial scrutiny, I do not find any thing therein contained more justly me∣riting so invidious a censure, than what may be found in divers publicacions of Congress on the same subject; some of which I have thought pro∣per to select and bring into view, beginning with the following remarkable language of the associati∣on entered into the 20th of October, 1774.</P>
<P>"And therefore we do for ourselves and the in∣habitants of the several colonies whom we represent, firmly agree and associate under the sacred tics of virtue, honor, and love of our country, as follows:</P>
<P>2d Article. "We will neither import nor pur∣chase any slaves imported after the first day of De∣cember next, after which time we will wholly dis∣continue the Slave Trade, and will neither be con∣cerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor fell our commodities or manufactures to those who are concerned in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Did not Virginia and Maryland consider this to be perpetual, by their Assemblies passing laws accor∣dingly?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>8th Article. "And will discountenance and discourage every species of extravagance and dissipa∣tion, especially all horse racing, and all kinds of gaming, cock-fighting, exhibitions of shews, plays, and other expensive diversions and entertainments."</P>
<P>To the Inhabitants of the Colonies.</P>
<P>"In every case of opposition by a people to their rulers, or of one state to another, duty to Almigh∣ty
<PB N="6" REF="025821_0005_0FCEF0766DEDDBB8"/>
God, the Creator of all, requires, that a true and impartial judgment be formed of the measures leading to such opposition; and of the causes by which it has been provoked, or can in any degree be justified, that neither affection on the one hand, nor resentment on the other, being permitted to give a wrong bias to reason, it may be enabled to take a dispassionate view of all circumstances, and to settle the public conduct on the solid foundations of wis∣dom and justice. From counsels thus tempered arise the purest hopes of the divine favor, the firmest encouragement to the parties engaged, and the strongest recommendations of their cause to the rest of mankind, &amp;c."</P>
<P>Address to the Inhabitants of Canada, May <HI>29, 1775.</HI></P>
<P>"When hardy attempts are made to deprive men of rights bestowed by the Almighty, when avenues are cut through the most solemn compacts for the admission of despotism."</P>
<P>Declaration July <HI>6, 1775,</HI> of the causes and necessity of taking up arms.</P>
<P>"If it were possible for men who exercise their reason to believe, that the Divine Author of our ex∣istence intended a part of the human race to hold an absolute property in, and unbounded power over others, marked out by infinite goodness and wisdom as the objects of a legal domination, never rightfully resistable, however severe and oppressive the inhabi∣tants of these colonies might at least require from the Parliament of Great Britain, some evidence that
<PB N="7" REF="025821_0006_0FCEF077F46D6300"/>
this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So may the Africans say</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"But a reverence for our great Creator, principles of humanity and the dictates of common sense must convince all those who reflect upon the subject, that government was instituted to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be administered for the attainment of that end. The Legislature of Great Britain however stimulated by an inordinate passion for power, &amp;c."</P>
<P><HI>2d.</HI> Address to the People of England, July <HI>8, 1775.</HI></P>
<P>"Britains can never become the instruments of oppression 'till they lose the spirit of freedom."</P>
<P>Address to Ireland, July <HI>28, 1775.</HI></P>
<P>"Compelled to behold thousands of our coun∣trymen imprisioned, and men, women, and children involved in promiscuous and unremitted misery, when we find all faith at an end, and sacred treaties turned into tricks of state; when we perceive our friends and kinsmen massacreed, our habitations plundered, our houses in flames."</P>
<P>And in the Declaration of Independence is inserted respecting the King as follows:</P>
<P>"He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works
<PB N="8" REF="025821_0007_0FCF2788C295BE40"/>
of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy searcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us."</P>
<P>And here I think it may be proper to mention, that under permission of Divine Providence, the measure which both Britains and Americans had long dealt to the natives of Africa, they were in like manner suffered reciprocally to mete out to each other, by burning towns, &amp;c. captivating their inha∣bitants, stowing them into gaols and prison ships, to linger under agonizing pains unto cruel death; at this stage of affairs Congress resolve at different times on public fasting and prayers, wherein they acknowledge the superintendence of an all wise Providence, and the obligations our nation was un∣der to reform from its sins and implore his merci∣ful interposition, to remove those calamities from the land, and avert those desolating judgments with which we were threatened. See Journal June 12, 1775, and March 16, 1776.</P>
<P>In a pamphlet, intitled, "Observations on the American Revolution," published by order of Con∣gress in 1779, the following sentiments are declared to the world, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The great principle (of government) is and ever will remain in force, <HI>that men are by nature free:</HI> as accountable to him that made them, they must be so; and so long as we have any idea of Divine Justice, we must associate that of human freedom. Whether men can part with their liberty, is among
<PB N="9" REF="025821_0008_0FCF278A80D47E70"/>
the questions which have exercised the ablest writ∣ers; but it is concluded on all hands, that the right to be free can never be alienated—still less is it practicable for one generation to mortgage the privileges of another."</P>
<P>After the laborious productions of the wisdom of this country, manifested to the world by the declarations and addresses from which the forego∣ing are extracted, with others of a similar nature, demonstrating the natural rights of men in so clear a manner, the following appears to have been adopted as the then faith of the nation, in the de∣claration of independence the 4th of July 1776, viz. "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that amongst these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."</P>
<P>At the time of entering into the solemn league and covenant (20th October 1774) to vindicate the rights of man, and promote national righteousness, had any one declared as their opinion that it was of mischievous consequence, tending to render un∣happy the helpless victims of despotic tyranny, and excite to insurrection, or attempted to enforce as a political creed, so detestable a position, as that a happy <HI>national harmony and union</HI> depended on se∣curing to one class of men, the power and privi∣lege of enslaving and exercising an imperious lord∣ship over another part of God's rational creation, such person, though he might not have been stig∣matized
<PB N="10" REF="025821_0009_0FCF278DB3E69B18"/>
as a fanatic—would doubtless have been in danger of being proscribed as an enemy to his coun∣try, and a traitor to the common cause of equal li∣berty: now feeling such a weight on my spirit, I am thereby impelled, by a sense of duty to the So∣vereign of the Universe, and the dictates of huma∣nity, to open my mouth for the dumb, in the cause of such as are appointed to destruction; and if this is fanaticism, enthusiasm, &amp;c. may the Almighty grant a double portion to what I ever experienced, if it be his holy will! I cannot use the carnal sword in my country's defence, I believe that weapon for a Christian to be unlawful, yet I trust I shall with the weapons that are to me lawful in the cause of my country, manifest as much firmness and stabi∣lity, though it be but in the exercise of one talent, as those who think themselves justified in the use of other and greater talents: and therefore, as I do indeed feel alarmed, when I consider that the so∣lemn professions so lately made in time of extremity and danger, and held up as the national faith, should so soon on this important occasion seem to be regarded as mere <HI>tricks of state,</HI> what can be thought will be the issue? may it not be consider∣ed like trifling with omnipotence?</P>
<P>I crave your patience, my fellow citizens—I am interested in the welfare of this country; but I can∣not have any conception that this nation will long fare well, when after such declamations against Bri∣tain on account of the despotic measures pursued by her administration, the spirit of tyranny and op∣pression is suffered so readily to prevail in the coun∣cils
<PB N="11" REF="025821_0010_0FCF278F95D48BF8"/>
of American rulers, to a degree in no instance exceeded by Britain; on which head I venture to appeal to the witness for God in your own breasts, which will undoubtedly shew the national iniquity is the same, whether it proceed from Acts of Con∣vention, or receive its strength from the counte∣nance of Congress.</P>
<P>Had Congress done as much towards removing this national guilt, as by the tenor of their own vote they have power to do, there is no doubt with me, but that it would at least have given a very powerful check, if not a total stop to the odious traffic, notwithstanding the plea of restriction in the constitution of the general government: but whe∣ther you will hear or forbear, I think it my duty to tell you plainly, that I believe the blood of the slain, and the oppression exercised in Africa, pro∣moted by Americans, and in this country also, will stick to the skirts of every individual of your body, who exercise the powers of Legislation, and do not exert their talents to clear themselves of this abomi∣nation, when they shall be arraigned before the tre∣mendous bar of the judgment-seat of him who will not fail to do right, in rendering unto every man his due; even him who early declared, "at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man;" before whom the natural black skin of the body will never occasion such degradation. I desire to approach you with proper and due respect, in the temper of a Christian, and the firmness of a veteran American Freeman, to plead the cause of injured innocence, and open my mouth for my
<PB N="12" REF="025821_0011_0FCF2791037D5368"/>
oppressed brethren, who cannot open theirs for themselves. I ask no pecuniary advantage for my∣self, neither post nor pension. I feel the sweets of American Liberty—I trust I am sensible of, and thankful for the favor; and am not easy to par∣take of mine so partially, and see, hear and know of my brethren and fellow mortals being so arbi∣trarily and cruelly deprived of theirs, and not en∣ter my protest. I desire to have this favor and blessing continued to myself and posterity, and can∣not but view the tenure, both to myself and coun∣trymen, as very precarious, while a plea is founded on the general constitution, in bar of the rights of man; and the equal distribution of justice being confirmed, that the views of a righteous govern∣ment would be, to promote the welfare of man∣kind universally, as well those of other nations, as the subjects or citizens of its own; and therefore, that it is obligatory on the United States, to pre∣vent the citizens thereof injuring the inhabitants of Africa, as those of one state the citizens of ano∣ther: and I doubt not in the least, if Africa was in a situation to send fleets and armies here to re∣taliate, but Congress would soon devise ways, with∣out violating the Constitution, to prevent our citi∣zens from aggravating them. The almost daily ac∣counts I have of the inhumanity perpetrated in these states on this race of men, distresses me night and day, and brings the subject of the Slave Trade with more pressure on my spirit; and I believe I feel a measure of the same obligation that the Prophet did when he was ordered to cry aloud, spare not, list up thy
<PB N="13" REF="025821_0012_0FCF2792A4166740"/>
voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their trans∣gressions, and the house of Jacob their sins. And here I think I can shew, that our nation are revolt∣ing from the law of God, the law of reason and hu∣manity, and the just principles of government; and with rapid strides establishing tyranny and oppressi∣on; to prove which, I need do no more than oppose the present conduct of the nation, to that part of it which I have now brought to your view, from the former journals of Congress, and then mention the sanction the African Slave Trade at this time has from the general government; in proof of which I may refer to the condition on which Congress ac∣cepted the cession of the Western Territory of North Carolina, viz. <HI>That no regulation made or to be made shall tend to emancipate slaves.</HI></P>
<P>I am concerned that the leaders of the people may not cause them to err, or strengthen them in error; the plea now is by state Legislators, as well as other classes of citizens, and even those abandon∣ed dealers in the persons of men, that Congress au∣thorizes the traffic as I myself now believe you vir∣tually do.</P>
<P>If your disapprobation of this trade as a body was publicly known to be sincere, I believe it would have a good effect; and if you are so it is my judg∣ment the people has a right to know and expect it from you. I am persuaded, nine tenths of the ci∣tizens of the United States reprobate the African Trade, and consider every slave imported an injury to the public; and that they repose confidence in your wisdom as guardians of the nation, to prevent
<PB N="14" REF="025821_0013_0FCF279943862D08"/>
its injury; and that herein you betray the trust re∣posed in you, which is indeed a great and weighty trust, even to do that which of right ought to be done by the nation; therefore it requires on this ve∣ry important subject your deep and serious conside∣ration, what you can do so as to obtain the favor of Divine Providence to this land, which I do indeed believe will be marked with something very different, if such an inhuman traffic is continued.</P>
<P>Humane petitions have been presented, to ex∣cite in Congress benevolent feelings for the suffer∣ings of our fellow citizens under cruel bondage to Turks and Algerines, and that the national power and influence might be exerted for their relief; with this virtuous application I unite, but lament that any of my countrymen, who are distinguished as men eminently qualified for public station, should be so enslaved by illiberal prejudice, as to treat with contempt a like solicitude for another class of men still more grievously oppressed.</P>
<P>I prosess freely, and am willing my profession was known over the world, that I feel the calls of hu∣manity as strong towards an African in America, as to an American in Algiers, both being my bre∣thren; especially as I am informed the Algerine treats his slave with more humanity; and I believe the sin of oppression on the part of the Ameri∣can, is greatest in the sight of the father of the fa∣mily of mankind.</P>
<P>I hope some will excuse my inserting, in this apo∣logetic expostulation, a few texts of scripture as they revive—I trust there are some of our rulers yet
<PB N="15" REF="025821_0014_0FCF279AC23B9438"/>
believe in the authenticity of the holy scriptures; what revives now, is the declaration of our Lord, Matt. 25 chap. and 41 verse. <HI>Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, depart from me ye cursed,</HI> &amp;c. They also shall answer him, saying— <HI>When saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stran∣ger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</HI> His answer then you may read, <HI>Inasmuch as you, did it not to the least of these, ye did it not to me.</HI></P>
<P>That I may not be thought to trespass on your patience on this momentous subject, after repeating my special request, that you would without delay exert your power and influence to frustrate the ava∣ricious purpose of those mercenaries, who are per∣haps now on their voyage from Liverpool to Afri∣ca, to bring to some of the Southern states cargoes of innocent human beings into cruel, unconditional bondage; the grounds I have for this apprehensi∣on, are I believe not unknown to some among you. I will draw towards a conclusion, with a quotation from the address of Congress to the Assembly of Jamaica, dated 26th of July 1775.</P>
<P>"We receive uncommon pleasure from observing the principles of our righteous opposition distin∣guished by your approbation: we feel the warmest gratitude for your pathetic mediation in our behalf with the crown—but are you to blame? mournful experience tells us, that petitions are often rejected, while the sentiments and conduct of the petitioners entitle what they offer to a happier fate."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="025821_0015_0FCF279C42D743B0"/>That wisdom from above may be mercifully vouchsafed to direct the councils of America, that this extensive and rising republic may be exalted by righteousness, and not overturned by pride, oppres∣sion, and forgetfulness of the rightful Ruler and Dread of Nations, is the prayer of an enthusiast in a pure and uncorrupted sense, and who am both yours individually, and my country's real friend,</P>

<P>OBSERVING in the Journals of Congress, giv∣en us in the last Gazette, mention is made of the reading and returning a Memorial subscribed by Warner Mifflin: As the design of publishing those Journals is, I presume, to give their constituents the means of forming an opinion of the doings of their representatives, I therefore request the enclosed copy of said Memorial may have a place in the next Gazette, as without it, no safe opinion can be formed upon that article in the Journals. The Memorialist has been well known to many, in almost every state in the union, to be a man of good sense and solid discernment, of a plentiful estate and unfullied character, a citizen of one of the southern states, and a firm friend to the uni∣versal liberty of mankind, both in principle and practice. Whether the sentiments in that Memo∣rial could consistently warrant the epithet <HI>fanatical,</HI> from any one Member of Congress, who profes∣seth to believe in the moral government of the world by a Supreme Being, the reader will judge.</P>

<HEAD>THE MEMORIAL OF WARNER MIFFLIN <HI>To the</HI> PRESIDENT, SENATE <HI>and</HI> HOUSE <HI>of</HI> RE∣PRESENTATIVES <HI>of the</HI> UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>He that ruleth over Men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</Q>
<BIBL>2d Samuel, xxiii. 3.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING for a long time felt my mind im∣pressed with a religious engagement on your account, and a belief, that if measures are not tak∣en to redress the wrongs, and alleviate the suffer∣ings and oppressions of the African race in these states, the Almighty will manifest his displeasure in a more conspicuous manner than has yet appear∣ed; the consideration whereof excites me, in his fear, earnestly to solicit, and solemnly to warn you, to exert your power and influence, that right and justice may be done in this important case.</P>
<P><HI>I have also been affected with the following de∣claration of the Prophet, Ezek. iii. 20.</HI> When a righte∣ous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not he remembered, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</P>
<P>21. Nevertheless, if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned, also thou hast delivered thy soul.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="025821_0019_0FCF27A483A9F530"/>Now I cannot view the declaration made by the first Congress, in substance to amount to any thing short of a solemn covenant entered into, with the God of heaven and the whole earth, viz <HI>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are cre∣ated equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty,</HI> &amp;c. and which remains obligatory on the present Congress so to consider. How then have those rights become alienated, that Americans should be permitted to continue to ravage the coast of Africa, thereby promoting murder, pillaging, plundering and burning its towns, and enslaving its inhabitants?—And in the United States, while some of those very men, who perhaps with their own hands subscribed the aforesaid declaration, re∣main in the supreme Legislature,' that avaricious men should be permitted to pass through the coun∣try, steal, buy, traffic, barter and exchange the blacks, as though they were indeed brute beasts, separating husband from wife, parents from chil∣dren, even mothers from infant babes, yea, from all that is dear to men in this world, except life, and indeed that also, as there are divers instances of their being murdered; others in iron setters, huddled into gaol until the number wanted is col∣lected, then stowed into vessels for transportation to foreign ports, and sold into perpetual slavery, not permitting a parting leave between the nearest ties of nature—</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025821_0020_0FCF27A7535C63F0"/>My soul now revolts at the infernal crime com∣mitted against innocent persons, without provoca∣tion. Oh let me now beseech you, not to think it too much degradation for you to reflect, was this the lot of one of your beloved delicate wives, your tender babes, or near relatives, how then would you feel!</P>
<P>Do not you with me believe, that there is a God of justice, who will finally recompence unto all men according to the fruit of their doings; and that he doth at one view, by his all penetrating eye, behold the actions of men over the face of the globe? if so, how do we think he will look on the rulers of this land, when he beholds many of them faring sumptuously every day, living in ease and fulness, and at the very time that they are invent∣ing unto themselves instruments of music, and spending their precious time in vain theatrical and Other amusements, remember not the afflictions of their suffering African brethren, who in this country may be loaded with irons, under all the pangs of sorrow the human heart can be capable of enduring, for no crime whatever, but because it pleased God to suffer them to come into the world with a black skin—will this not make him your enemy, who is a God that is no respecter of persons?</P>
<P>I crave your serious attention to this important subject; and that while you may feel an animated warmth to fill your minds, when engaged respect∣ing the natives of this land, you suffer a turn of
<PB N="7" REF="025821_0021_0FCF27A84AF7ADA0"/>
thought respecting the conduct of Americans in Africa, and in this country also towards Africans, and see if any savage cruelty of the natives can exceed that of the white people towards the Africans, considering our superior advantage of civilization, under the light of the gospel. Let us consider we are informed, that the measure we mete to others is to be meted to us; and likewise, that we may so conduct, as never to feel the effects (in the full extent) of the declaration of the Almighty for∣merly delivered to a highly favored people, in fai∣lure of complying with their covenants and en∣gagements, viz. <HI>Jerom.</HI> xxxiv.17. <HI>Behold I pro∣claim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the famine, and to the pestilence.</HI></P>
<P>Is there not reason to acknowledge, that we have seen in some measure fulfilled a part of the first? are there not traces of the second? and do we not acknowledge, that all three are subservient to Almighty power! and has our nation fulfilled its covenant? Oh! my countrymen and fellow-citi∣zens, be serious on this subject, and allow me the liberty of a free expostulation with you. I feel for the welfare of my country, and my fellow-citizens, every one of whom I love; and believing myself eve∣ry way equally interested with the largest part of your body in the welfare of my country, I hoped you would allow me freely thus far to relieve my pained heart, who feel so much on account of the barba∣rous cruelties exercised on an unoffending people,
<PB N="8" REF="025821_0022_0FCF27A9C7B54FF8"/>
(which I am persuaded you generally have not a full conception of) that under an apprehension of duty I have attempted in this manner to address you; being, with sincere desires for your welfare,</P>
