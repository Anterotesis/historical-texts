<HEAD>On the joys of God's House and Worship.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CXXII. 1, 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.</P>
<P>Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JERUSALEM was not only the seat of government for the Commonwealth of Israel, but also of the church of GOD. On this favoured spot stood the National Temple, whither the tribes of the LORD went up to pray and praise. The happiness of the nation was so connected with the prosperity of the church, that whatever touched the one, would af∣fect the other. It was presumed, therefore, that He who had an intelligent regard for the prosperity and happiness of civil society, would discover it by a suit∣able affection for the house and worship of GOD.</P>
<P>THIS psalm seems to have been composed to be sung at the general national festival, when the assembled tribes had opportunity to meet each other with mutual congratulations, and unite together in devoutly wor∣shipping their common Creator: And by an easy transfer of the sentiments it contains to the occasion of our present meeting, it may afford instruction both
<PB N="4" REF="028839_0003_0FDDD87CE208FB70"/>
useful and entertaining. For the church of CHRIST is called, The Jerusalem that is above.</P>
<P>WE <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>embled, my respected auditory, for the purpose of solemnly separating and setting apart a house erected for religious worship; and of dedicating of it unto GOD. May it never be profaned by impie∣ty, nor dishonored by improper uses! May it be for∣ever sacred to GOD and his service! Here, may thy worship arise as incense, and the offerings of thy peo∣ple be an acceptable memorial before thee!</P>
<P>THE duties of piety and devotion are the most im∣portant part of the service which is due from man to his Maker. In vain do we offer GOD the outward form without the homage of the heart! And in vain do we profess to have devotion, unless we have clean hands and a pure heart, moral virtue and christian charity! These are sentiments which should always accompany us to the house of GOD.</P>
<P>MAY they impress our minds while we proceed to consider this congratulatory hymn, and apply it to the present occasion.</P>
<P>"<HI>I WAS glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the</HI> LORD. <HI>Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem,</HI> Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: Whither the tribes of the LORD go up, the tribes of the LORD unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. For there are set thrones of judgment; the thrones of the house of David."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="028839_0004_0FDDD8812F257158"/>WITH inimitable melody he represents them as ex∣pressing, in semichoir, the pleasure they received by the invitations to go up to the temple, echoed by the full choir "<HI>Our feet shall stand</HI>—;" because the worship and order of it was fair as the moon, clear as the sun; and the workmanship of it was as beautiful as Tirzah, and comely as Jerusalem.</P>
<P>MANY of them came from a distance. They did not decline the fatigues that must attend going there. But urged on by the love they felt for the house and worship of GOD, they rejoiced in the opportunity of at∣tending there. They celebrate the uniformity and ele∣gance of the city, which added beauty to the temple, while that in turn contributed much to ornament the city.</P>
<P>IT was on this account that they were encouraged to go from strength to strength. Here they beheld every thing decent and in order. Here they consult togeth∣er the oracles of GOD. They worship Him together. And as the order and arrangement of the building, formed a faint emblem of the glory and magnificence of the great Builder of the temple above, so it had a good effect on the mind.</P>
<P>IT was matter of joy too that this seat of worship was also the seat of justice and of judgment, where their civil rights and ecclesiastical concerns were patronized and secured. Though religion needs not the aid of civil government to defend, much less to prove its truth, yet government needs the aid of religion to sup∣port it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028839_0005_0FDDD882B3911C60"/>FEEBLE indeed were the efforts of law in the hand of civil officers to control the unruly passions of men, were they not restrained by the more awful sanctions of religion. Happy the state where the current of justice runs pure by the temple of GOD! Where religion ren∣ders all in authority a terrror to evil doers!</P>
<P>THE favourable aspect of morality and religion on the prosperity and happiness of society cannot be doubt∣ed. Indeed, it is a well known fact, that those places are more opulent and happy where publick worship is made respectable, by suitable houses dedicated to GOD, and His worship steadily supported, than where they are neglected. The expense notwithstanding.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS establishments are the just abhorrence of freemen, both as a violation of the rights of conscience, and as the bane of pure religion, by introducing an ab∣horrent system of corruption, priestcraft and state poli∣cy: But the experience of mankind envinces the im∣portance of upholding religious institutions.</P>
<P>THE air of respectability which elegant churches give a town, tends to its prosperity and happiness, by inviting settlers, by giving a spring to industry, and by promoting order. The respect which religion ac∣quires by an open, fair and liberal support, has a great influence on the welfare of society, by refining the sen∣timents and polishing the manners of men. The ef∣fect on the education of youth, and in forming the char∣acter of the rising generation, is unspeakably great. And while these pleasing effects are produced on the face of the world, the way is prepared for the growth
<PB N="7" REF="028839_0006_0FDDD886C637B490"/>
of real virtue and piety in the heart, which are the final objects of all religious institutions.</P>
<P>THESE things are, in their operation, promotive of the best interests of mankind on earth. They are at the same time, by their instructive and moral tendency, training up men for higher scenes of nobler joys.—Thus the institutions of religion, by qualifying men to be citizens on earth and ornaments in the church, are preparing them to receive, as the gift of GOD'S grace, the rank of citizenship in heaven, and to shine as stars in the firmament above.</P>
<P>"<HI>PRAY for the peace of Jerusalem; they shall prosper that love thee.</HI>" Since so many blessings attend the or∣dinances of religion, how natural to call on the church to pray for the city which contained them, especially when both their outward prosperity, and inward and spiritual comfort depend on the blessing of GOD.</P>
<P>THE welfare of men on earth depends so much on the preservation of order, that to pray and exert our∣selves for the prosperity of Zion, is an evidence of our regard for the good of the world, and is a mean of en∣creasing our attachment to it. With this publick and generous spirit, christianity inspires its true subjects, and is itself the highest possible example of it, in the astonishing act of its Author and Founder, who died a martyr to the truth and importance of our subject.</P>
<P>SO true is the saying, that "godliness is profitable to the life that now is," that he who exerts himself for
<PB N="8" REF="028839_0007_0FDDD887EF12FAC8"/>
the honour and interest of religious institutions, is con∣sulting his own good and prosperity. By a wise con∣stitution of things, it is so ordered, that he who casts his bread on the waters shall receive again after many days.</P>
<P>HE will find his account in all his deeds of charity or of publick utility, in one way or another. Whate∣ver service he renders the church of GOD, he thereby lays up in store a good foundation for himself or his children. Though he should experience no particular marks of prosperity himself, he has the consolation of reflecting that he has laid the foundation for it in pos∣terity, by the order he has contributed to establish.</P>
<P>THE Psalmist thought it a sufficient reason to wish peace and prosperity to Jerusalem, because that city contained the temple of GOD. "<HI>Peace be within thy walls.</HI>"—It is not uncommon for man to envy the pros∣perity of the opulent and the condition of publick char∣acters. But a better spirit is inculcated in the house of GOD; even to pray for them. Of how much conse∣quence, then, to their comfort and tranquillity, that they should give publick countenance and sanction to the institution of worship?</P>
<P>"<HI>FOR my brethren and companions' sake, I will now say, peace be within thee.</HI>" The interests our friends have in the prosperity of the church should engage our at∣tention to it. Their happiness, as ours, depends on the preservation and growth of religion. But how is this to be effected but by keeping up religious in∣stitutions.</P>
<P>WERE religion left to a solitary retreat without hous∣es or forms of worship, how would the spirit of it die
<PB N="9" REF="028839_0008_0FDDD88C1F3793C0"/>
away for want of public countenance; and with the failure of this, how would iniquity and every evil work abound? But there are many who wish well, but can do but little towards the support of religion. Those may be among the salt of the earth, by whose moral influ∣ence the system is preserved. "<HI>For their sakes</HI>" should we cultivate a public spirit, and seek the good of the church.</P>
<P>"<HI>BECAUSE of the house of the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, <HI>I will seek thy good.</HI>" To prayers in the church, every good man will add his endeavors to promote the welfare of the State, and so much the more as they enjoy protection from it, and freedom in the exercise of religion.</P>
<P>IT is the wisdom of the state to hold out public countenance and encouragement to religion, not by re∣ligious establishments in favor of one and to oppress another sect; but by extending equal patronage to all literary and religious institutions, and by the appoint∣ment of friends to religion to public offices. Then the influence would be reciprocal. The state would derive a salutary influence from the temple, and that in turn, the countenance of the state.</P>
<P>THE sanctions or civil law can reach no further than the outward act, and that only as discovered and support∣ed by legal evidence; but those of religion extend to the heart, take hold of the conscience, and strike at the root of wickedness. While the one can only lop off the branches within its reach, the other is tearing up the tree by the roots. Judge then whether the institutions of religion deserve not the countenance of every wise and judicious citizen.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028839_0009_0FDDD88D476714A0"/>IN the application of the subject we are led to make the following reflections:</P>
<P>THE first is, that all good men will rejoice in the prosperity of the christian church: Yea, that all who consult the good of society will pay respect to the insti∣tution of public worship.</P>
<P>INDEED, the psalmist intimates that the want of this spirit of philanthropy is inconsistent with an honest and good heart; and therefore takes it for granted that all such would cultivate it. The more of this benevolent disposition we possess, the more shall we resemble Him who is the standard of all perfection. In whatever breast this spirit prevails, towards the church in general, there will be an attachment to the particular christian so∣ciety with which we are connected; not to the exclu∣sion of any others from our charity; much less to their injury.</P>
<P>THE rational ends which men have in view in form∣ing into distinct religious societies are, the opportunity of worshipping GOD according to the dictates of their own consciences, and the convenience of attending an uniform mode of social worship with their families.—How important this is to the education of children and youth, let the experience of the world declare!</P>
<P>BUT in vain do men profess an attachment to socie∣ty unless they are willing to exert the abilities which GOD hath given them to promote its welfare. Expen∣ses necessarily arise in erecting houses of worship and upholding the stated ministry, which requires their u∣nited
<PB N="11" REF="028839_0010_0FDDD88ECC126888"/>
exertion to defray, because it is for common good. A moment's consideration will show every wise man the necessity of the former, and convince him of the pro∣priety of the latter. It is a sentiment that meets the common ideas of justice, that "the laborer is worthy of his hire;" and it is a statute of immutable obligation in the christian kingdom, that—"they who preach the gospel shall live of the gospel."—But I will not offend the understanding of an enlightened audience by dwell∣ing on so plain a case.</P>
<P>ANOTHER sentiment arising from the subject, is, that some respect is due to the construction of houses erected for the worship of GOD.</P>
<P>GREAT and magnificent was the temple of the Jews at Jerusalem, built under the direction of the great head of the church. Although this may not afford a suitable model for the more spiritual institution of christ∣ian worship, yet it is presumable that a rational venera∣tion for the Deity will lead to the bestowment of much labor and expense upon buildings dedicated to GOD. Will it be objected that GOD is not confined to the walls of houses, nor pleased with the elegance of build∣ings or costly offerings—that all nature is his temple, and that he is worshipped through the vast amplitude of space? Be it granted! yet though we cannot be profit∣able to GOD, His worship made respectable, may be so to us. He is not confined to houses, but houses built for convenience of social worship are appropriat∣ed to Him. And if we follow the allusion in the objec∣tion, may we not ask in turn—Why ought they not, in humble imitation of the superb structure of his univer∣sal temple, to be the master strokes of human ingenuity,
<PB N="12" REF="028839_0011_0FDDD89206507480"/>
the highest efforts of human skill? At least, fitness re∣quires that the beauty and elegance of houses for worship should ever correspond to the progress of wealth and refinement in society, with which other buildings keep pace. Otherwise there would be a marked inattention to religious order; and the want of decent accommodations might be pleaded by peo∣ple of taste for the neglect of public worship.</P>
<P>HAPPILY, the people of this town can have no such apology for such neglect! Few towns, of its size, per∣haps, none in the United States exceeds it in this res∣pect.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The new meeting house in Providence, at the dedication of which this sermon was also delivered, is 87 by 71 feet on the ground plat. That in Brookfield west-pa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh, is 64 by 51, and considering its remoteness from any great commercial town, must be viewed as possessing a high degree of elegance.</NOTE> This society finding their house of worship out of repair and not sufficiently large to accommodate their growing numbers, conceived the bold design of erecting another which will stand as a lasting monument of praise to the present generation. What seemed to be wanting in ability has been supplied by generous and harmonious exertions; and Divine Providence smiling on efforts so laudable hath rendered them successful. And we are this day called to felicitate you on the cheer∣ful, but serious occasion of dedicating to GOD the house ye have builded for His name! May the same spirit of concord and▪ brotherly love, that have marked your proceedings in projecting and accomplishing this no∣ble edifice, continue among you and render you happy in the enjoyment of it!</P>
<P>A THIRD observation that results from the foregoing discourse, is the union of duty with pleasure in attend∣ing public worship.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="028839_0012_0FDDD89348764E38"/>IN vain are houses erected for this purpose, unless we have some pleasure in hearing it said—"<HI>Let us go into the house of the</HI> LORD," and our hearts respond—"<HI>My feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.</HI>" That we should worship GOD together is a dictate of reason. What can be more fit and reasonable than that beings constantly dependent on GOD should acknowledge this to Him; should thank Him for His favours; commit themselves to His protection, and seek His blessing? This joint offering is necessary in our social state be∣cause our wants are common, and so are our blessings; and this is a public and visible mark of respect and reverence for the giver of every good gift.</P>
<P>BUT, besides those outward expressions of worship and homage, the public institutions of religion afford a convenient opportunity of communicating useful in∣structions to all, old and young. There are always to be found, in society, many individuals who need the benefit of such communications from those whose busi∣ness is study and improvement. How many are there who have neither time nor means for gaining this knowledge? And how much need have those who pos∣sess both to be quickened in the knowledge they have? What method so suitable to effect▪ this as public ad∣dresses to people congregated for that purpose, in ra∣tional and well digested discourses on moral and reli∣gious subjects? The benevolent design of such institu∣tions, and the rational ends of such public religious as∣semblies, must be a reason sufficient to induce every well wisher to the best interest of society to give their exem∣plary attendance, though it were only of human ap∣pointment. But where to this motive, is added the
<PB N="14" REF="028839_0013_0FDDD894C582DBB0"/>
weight of Divine authority, how does the obligation encrease?</P>
<P>THE institution of social worship is coeval with so∣ciety itself, and has met the approving voice of men in all ages. Particular directions were given about it to the Jews. Solemn assemblies were continued under the gospel; and the neglect of them was considered as apostacy from the faith. And to the preservation of these may be ascribed all the appearances of religion which we this day behold in the world. It requires no great penetration to discern, nor force of argument to prove, that without this method of preserving a remem∣brance of the Deity in the world, and of cultivating on the mind a due reverence for Him, a general forgetful∣ness of Him would ensue. The feeble light of natural reason would soon be clouded; and human nature un∣der the weight of its own infirmities and degraded pas∣sions would soon degenerate into wildness and barbarism.</P>
<P>HENCE among all civilized nations stated seasons for calling of the mind from the employments of this life have been observed, and means used for directing it to the concerns of another. Without the restraints of re∣ligion, what happiness, yea, what safety could be en∣joyed in the world? Take away those ties, and you let loose the whole army of the wretched and the desperate upon the industrious, the affluent, and the happy; and open the door for violence to stalk at noon day, unawed by fear, and unrestrained by principle. To awaken these principles is the office of religion, and to keep a∣live this restraint is the tendency of public worship. How can parents expect dutiful children, or masters
<PB N="15" REF="028839_0014_0FDDD89897CD79B0"/>
faithful servants, unless they are seen openly and pub∣licly to acknowledge, in a dutiful manner, the athor∣ity of the great Parent and Ruler of men?</P>
<P>IT cannot be thought an improper use of the subject if I make use of the occasion to remind you of one cir∣cumstance that should ever attend your assembling here.</P>
<P>THE house is such as reflects honor upon you. Its walls are sacred by consecration and appointment only, your principal pleasure therefore in coming hither should not be the gratification of the eye but the ex∣ercise of devotion in worshipping GOD in spirit and in truth. May your delight in coming to this house of the LORD be in communion with Him, and in hearing from Him out of His word! Must not that heart be awfully engrossed with the vanities of this world that can take no pleasure in those things—that cannot sep∣erate the Sabbath from the common business of the week and devote it unto GOD?</P>
<P>IT is the character of the true worshippers that "<HI>they love the habitation of His house and the place where His honor dwells.</HI>" Their hearts are there and where their hearts are they will endeavor to be also. They will conscientiously attend the appointed means of moral instruction and religious improvement, with a view to benefit themselves by "<HI>adding to their virtue, knowl∣edge</HI>;" and for the benefit of others, by their counte∣nance and example.</P>
<P>THIS whole assembly will permit me to recommend to them to preserve a due respect to religion.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="028839_0015_0FDDD89ABB78FDA8"/>THERE are never wanting those who endeavour, by the force of ridicule, to undermine the pillars of the christian church, and to sap the foundation of all reli∣gious worship and order. Let not your respect for so useful an institution be lessened either by the raillery of those who make a mock at sin, or by their example—whose conduct casts contempt on the institution of re∣ligious worship. But rather rejoice that there are still so many who favor the cause of Zion, and that, in this, you have the countenance of the wisest and most virtuous, who rejoice in hearing it said—"<HI>Let us go into the house of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>THE things there discoursed on carry in them an air of high importance. They claim to be from GOD. They have respect to the best interests of men. They therefore, demand the attention even of the infidel him∣self, who can never disprove their truth; and on account of their great public utility claim attendance on these forms of instruction. Shall the polished period of the Orator be listened to with attention—shall the artful mimicry of the actor excite alternate joy or grief or in∣dignation, and shall not the awful majesty of the gos∣pel warm and affect the heart? What subjects so de∣serving our attention as those contained in the gospel? They are of all others the most interesting. They have an influence on our present condition; yea, their effects run parallel to our existence. They open to us the great things of eternity. They treat of a day of final judgment—of worlds dissolving with fervent heat—the universal wreck of nature—the joys of heaven, and the perdition of ungodly men.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028839_0016_0FDDD89C351EE080"/>SUCH, and so great are the subjects that chalange your attention in this house! And it should be remembered that the day is approaching in which we must all ren∣der an account of our doings, how we have heard, and how we have improved the privileges we have enjoyed. To that momentous period may all our conduct bear reference; that from worshipping GOD in earthly tem∣ples, we may, in His own time, be translated to the temple above to join the general choir in ascribing un∣to Him, blessing and honor and glory and power for∣ever and ever. AMEN.</P>
