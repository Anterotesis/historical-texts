How much soever the abandon'd Sons of Vice might be gratified with a Persuasion, that the <HI>Deity</HI> is confin'd to the <HI>Third Heaven,</HI> and not concern'd about Persons and Things in this lower <HI>World:</HI> It is certain, this Thought would overspread the Souls of the wise and serious Part of <HI>Mankind</HI> with Clouds and Darkness.</P>
<P>But Thanks be to GOD; notwithstanding the many and great <HI>Apostacies</HI> of this <HI>Land,</HI> our Degeneracy hath not proceeded to this Degree and Pitch of <HI>Atheism:</HI> We yet believe there is a glorious <HI>Providence</HI> managed by the sovereign, unerring, powerful, righteous, faith∣full and merciful Hand of the <HI>Most High.</HI></P>
<P>What but the Consideration of <HI>this</HI> induceth us re∣ligiously to <HI>assemble</HI> in this <HI>sacred</HI> Place, upon the joyful Return of our Anniversary Solemnities? Is not a Sense of our Dependance upon GOD, the great Motive of our coming into His <HI>House,</HI> this Morning? Is not the Belief, that He interests Himself in the Concerns of Men on Earth; that it is with Him graciously to con∣tinue us in the Enjoyment of the invaluable <HI>Privileges,</HI> which He hath given us; to direct and influence in the momentous Transactions of <HI>this Day,</HI> and the Affairs of Government the <HI>Year</HI> ensuing: Is not this <HI>Belief</HI> the Reason of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Supplications</HI> we present unto Him, and the Oblation of <HI>Praise</HI> we pay Him, for <HI>publick</HI> Blessings?</P>

The inspired Book of <HI>Psalms,</HI> out of which I have chosen the Passage, now read in your Audience, abounds in a peculiar Manner, in the Displays of the matchless Glory and Grandeur of the blessed GOD, as the supream Ruler and Governour of the World; it is fruitful in the Exhibitions of His boundless and everlasting Domi∣nion and Kingdom; gives us Assurance, that His Angels, those Ministers whom He hath made Flames of Fire, <HI>do His Commandment, and hearken to the Voice of His Word</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal</HI> 10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0</NOTE>. That He doth what He pleaseth in the <HI>Realms of Light above,</HI> and Governs in the inferior <HI>Heavens</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal,</HI> 148. 8</NOTE>. That His <HI>Footstool</HI> is not below His Cognizance and Concern; but that He extends His Inspection and pro∣vidential <HI>Influences</HI> to all Parts of this lower Creation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 135. 6.</NOTE>.—And, that the <HI>Legions of Darkness</HI> are under His Government<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 78. 49.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But not to be too <HI>general,</HI> I shall contract and con∣fine my Thoughts to one particular Branch of Divine <HI>Providence,</HI> plainly directed to in the Words of the <HI>Psalmist, GOD standeth in the Congregation of the Mighty.</HI></P>
<P>The heavenly <HI>Intelligencies</HI> have the Stile <HI>Mighty</HI> given them in the sacred Oracles. The great <HI>Apostle</HI> declares, That <HI>the Lord Jesus Christ will be revealed from Heaven with His Mighty Angels</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. 1: 7.</NOTE>: And <HI>St. John</HI> in his <HI>Visions,</HI> saw a <HI>mighty Angel</HI> make his Descent from the upper World<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> 10. 1.</NOTE>: But the <HI>Mighty,</HI> whom the sacred Penman speaks of, are, in the Context, charged with judging unjustly, and accepting Persons, are exhorted to defend the Poor and Fatherless, and do Justice to the Afflicted and Needy; and tho' they are called Gods, yet were obliged to die like Men: Characters utterly incompatible to those spotless and immortal Creatures who surround the Throne of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005737_0007_1026D44D065ED818"/>
It is evident then, That by the <HI>Mighty,</HI> in the Con∣gregation of whom GOD is said to stand, we are to understand <HI>Men</HI> that are concerned in the Government of a People, those that sustain high Posts, who have the <HI>Legislative</HI> Power in their Hands, who assemble and sit to consider, determine and resolve upon what will be for the Relief and Good of particular Persons, and Bodies and Societies of Men under their Jurisdiction; and the Defence, Peace and Happiness of the People in general, committed to their Charge: These are the Per∣sons, I conceive, whom the Psalmist means, when he says, <HI>GOD standeth in the Congregation of the Mighty.</HI></P>
<P>In this great Congregation GOD standeth: I suppose every one will easily conceive, that bodily Parts and Postures are by no means strictly and properly to be ascribed unto Him, who is an immense <HI>Spirit;</HI> but with∣out any Difficulty will see a <HI>Figure</HI> in the Word. Should we take it strictly and literally it would be to debase the <HI>Godhead,</HI> and make Him such an one as ourselves<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> 50. 21.</NOTE>: When it is said then, <HI>GOD standeth in the Congregation of the Mighty,</HI> we are to understand (as I apprehend) His inspecting and affording this honourable and important Assembly His protecting Presence and gracious In∣fluence.</P>
<P>I shall endeavour to discourse upon the Words under the two following PROPOSITIONS.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>IT is most fit and suitable, that there should be a</HI> Number <HI>concern'd in the</HI> Civil Government <HI>of a People.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>THE great GOD is present in the Assembly of</HI> Political <HI>Rulers.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005737_0008_1026D450DC6CBFA8"/>
I. <HI>It is most fit and suitable, that there should be a</HI> Number <HI>concer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in the</HI> Civil Government <HI>of a People.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Congregation of the Mighty,</HI> says the Text, im∣plying there was a <HI>Number</HI> invested with Power and Authority convened for the Exercise thereof. Now that it is most fit and suitable it should be, will appear from the three following Things.</P>
<P N="1">1<SUP>st</SUP>, Such is the <HI>Infirmity</HI> and <HI>Darkness</HI> of the human Understanding in Man's present Condition, as to render Government managed by a <HI>Number</HI> of Men most eligible.</P>
<P>In this State of Imperfection, the intellectual Powers of Mankind labour under great Disadvantages; tho' they may be greatly improv'd, strengthned and brightned by Use, Study, Education and Conversation: The wisest Man is not always wise; his Mind is subject to <HI>Inadvertency,</HI> and his Memory needs a <HI>Monitor:</HI> Tho' his Capacity be large and extensive, yet there may be some Things re∣lating to the publick Good, that have escaped his Obser∣vation, that others may take Notice of; and for this Reason 'tis best there should be an Assembly of Rulers: The Welfare of a People may be more promoted by having <HI>many</HI> Heads employ'd for it, than One only.</P>
<P>When there is a <HI>Number</HI> concern'd in <HI>Government,</HI> setting to deliberate and resolve upon Measures proper to be taken for the Safety, Peace and Advantage of a People, or the Relief and Happiness of particular Men; the Debates, in such an Assembly, are productive of <HI>Light,</HI> which tends to prepare and ripen the Thoughts of <HI>Rulers</HI> for coming to a Determination upon the weighty Mat∣ters that call for their Consideration.</P>
<P N="2">2<SUP>dly</SUP>, The <HI>Burden</HI> of Government, if faithfully attend∣ed, is too great for a <HI>single</HI> Person to bear.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005737_0009_1026D45373B36D88"/>
It is a Business that is very ponderous; the Cares and Fatigues of it are too painful and heavy to be sustained by <HI>one</HI> Man; his Strength had need be the Strength of Scones, and his Flesh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, or he will sink under them. Apprehensive of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was <HI>Jethro,</HI> Father-in-law to <HI>Moses;</HI> when he saw him sit alone, from Morning to Evening, to judge the People; he was concern'd for him, and said, <HI>the Thing that thou doest is not good, thou wilt surely wear away; this Thing is too heavy for thee, thou art not able to perform it thyself alone;</HI> and then he gives him this prudent <HI>Advice,</HI> to <HI>provide out of all the People able Men, such as feared GOD: Men of Truth, hating Covetousness, and to place them over the People.</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Exodus</HI> 18. 17, 18, 21, 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is a Multiplicity of arduous Concerns that he upon the Hands, and fill the Head of a <HI>Civil Ruler;</HI> and it is so especially at some particular <HI>Junctures.</HI> The Safety and Defence of his People is to be intensely re∣garded, when Enemies make <HI>War</HI> against them: Their Trade is to be protected; it may be, they are fallen into perplext and distressing Circumstances, and, if it can be, are to be extricated and delivered out of them: Good Laws must be supported, and new ones occasionally made; meet Persons to <HI>execute</HI> them are to be chosen, and put into Commission: <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> are to be upheld, and Measures taken to promote the flourishing of these great Interests: The <HI>Grievances</HI> of particular Persons and Societies must, if it be practicable, be redress'd. It is not enough, that a Ruler take Care, that the People don't suffer in their Persons and Interests; but he must lay himself out to advance their <HI>Prosperity:</HI> And it may be further observed, that sometimes a People are grievous∣ly out of <HI>Frame;</HI> and this renders the Difficulties of Government so much the greater. The composed, meek and patient Leader of <HI>Israel,</HI> found the Discontent and Uneasiness of his People to be more than he could bear,

<HI>How can I myself alone,</HI> said he, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear your Cumbr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, and your Burden, and your Strife?</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Deut. 1. 12.</NOTE> And he than ex∣postulated with the glorious GOD,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Numb 1</NOTE> <HI>Have I conceived all this People, have I begotten them? that Thou shouldst say unto me, Carry them in thy Bosom, (as a nursing Fa∣ther carrieth the sacking Child) unto the Land which Then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rest unto the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Fathers: I am not able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear all this People alone, because it is too heavy for me.</HI> The compassionate GOD heard the Complaint of his dejected Servant, and provided Assistance for him, said unto him, <HI>Gather unto Me seventy of the Elders of</HI> Israel, <HI>whom thou knowest to be the</HI> Elders <HI>of the People, and Officers over them, and bring them unto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, that they may stand there with thee, and I will come down, and talk with thee there; and I will take of the Spirit, that is upon thee, and I will put it upon them, and they shall bear the Burden of the People with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.</HI> It is very evident then, that the <HI>Government</HI> of a People is too great a Labour and Burden for One to bear; and conse∣quently it is most fit and suitable, that a Number should be employed and concerned therein, that there should be <HI>an Assembly</HI> of Rulers to share the Labours, Cares and Troubles which attend it.</P>
<P N="3">3<SUP>dly</SUP>, For one Person alone to have the Government of a People in his Hands, would be too great a Temp∣tation.</P>
<P>It tends to excite and draw forth the Pride of Man, to make him unsufferably haughty; it gives him too much Liberty to exert his <HI>Corruptions;</HI> and it encourages him to become a <HI>Tyrant</HI> and an <HI>Oppressor,</HI> to <HI>dispense</HI> with Laws, and break the most solemn Oaths; to pro∣ceed so far in his unrighteous Practices, that his Subjects, weary of the Doctrine of <HI>passive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-resis∣tance,</HI> are necessitated to plead their own Cause, and vin∣dicate
<PB N="12" REF="005737_0011_1026D459F1E8CF48"/>
their Rights by Measures which for a long Time they were loth to make Use of.—Thus King <HI>James the Second,</HI> tir'd with <HI>Parliaments,</HI> and thirsting after a des∣potick Power, set them aside; and such <HI>arbitrary</HI> Courses did he take, that his injured, provoked Subjects, arm'd themselves in Defence of their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Liberties;</HI> the Consequence of which was his <HI>abdicating</HI> the Throne, which, by all his Attempts and the Endeavours of his Friends, he could never afterwards recover. So let the Efforts of his <HI>pretended Son</HI> to seat himself upon the <HI>British Throne,</HI> be blasted by Heaven, and rendered abortive, as (blessed be GOD) they have hitherto been.</P>
<P>From the Whole then, it appears, that it is most fit and suitable that a <HI>Number</HI> should be concern'd in <HI>Civil Government,</HI> that it is best for a People to be under such a Constitution and Establishment, whether it be a mixt <HI>Monarchy,</HI> that excellent Form which <HI>our Nations,</HI> and the <HI>British Plantations</HI> are happily in the Enjoyment of, who are governed by a KING, House of <HI>Peers,</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> the latter of which are chosen by the People; or an <HI>Aristocracy,</HI> which is the Government of a <HI>Com∣monwealth,</HI> by <HI>Nobles;</HI> or a <HI>Democracy,</HI> wherein <HI>Magi∣strates</HI> are elected from among and by the People.</P>

<ITEM>I pass now to take the <HI>Second Proposition</HI> under Consideration.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>The great GOD is present in the</HI> Assembly <HI>of Political Rulers.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To illustrate this <HI>Head,</HI> I shall consider in what Respects He is present in this <HI>Assembly.</HI></P>
<P>It would be too great a Departure from the Intention of the Text, should I observe, that He is present in it <HI>Representatively,</HI> although 'tis so in <HI>Fact,</HI> for Rulers are his Vicegerents, his Agents, and exhibit some Image of

His Authority and governing Power: For this Reason they are called Gods in Scripture, they are stiled so twice in the <HI>Psalm</HI> that contains my <HI>Text: He judgeth among the Gods: I said ye are Gods:</HI> But not to dwell upon this Thought.</P>
<P N="1">1<SUP>st</SUP>, The <HI>inspecting Presence</HI> of the great GOD is al∣ways in this Assembly.</P>
<P>He is an immense <HI>Being,</HI> and therefore Omniscient: <HI>Is He a GOD at hand, and not afar off; and can any hide themselves in secret Places, that He should not see them? He fills Heaven and Earth with His Presence;</HI> and nothing escapes His Observation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hath not He, who governs and will judge the World, a universal Knowledge of Men, their Actions and Beha∣viour? Besure His <HI>Eyes are in every Place, beholding the Evil and the Good</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> 15. 3.</NOTE>; He <HI>pandereth Men's Goings</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> 5. 21.</NOTE>; and <HI>all Things are open and naked unto Him</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb</HI> 4. 13.</NOTE>: Who can doubt then of His <HI>inspecting Presence,</HI> it's being in the Assembly of <HI>Political Rulers?</HI> He takes a particular and critical View of them, seeth who they are who com∣pose the Congregation of the <HI>Mighty,</HI> and sit in this <HI>Honourable Assembly;</HI> He calls them all by Name: <HI>His Eyes are like a Flame of Fire;</HI> and penetrate into the Hearts of Rulers: <HI>The Lord seeth not as Man seeth; Man looketh at the outward Appearance, but the Lord looketh at the Heart</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. 7.</NOTE> If any of the Members that com∣pose this <HI>Society</HI> are govern'd by low, mean, base and selfish Principles in their Proceedings; if they are in∣fluenced by a Party-Spirit, and have no Regard for the publick Good, any further than is consistent with their private Interests, the Omniscient GOD remarks it: Are there any <HI>careless, indolent Members,</HI> contented with the Honours and Emoluments of their advanced Seats, not
<PB N="14" REF="005737_0013_1026D460D5D5B8C0"/>
attending to the weighty Concerns of <HI>Government,</HI> the great GOD is privy to it: He is conscious of it, if there be any who indulge themselves in letting their Minds be absent from the Business of their exalted Stations, who depend upon their <HI>Brethren</HI> to think for them; and by an <HI>implicit Faith,</HI> will give their <HI>Votes</HI> with the Majority, not weighing and examining Matters themselves, which they act upon: If <HI>Iniquity</HI> should be established by a Law, in this Assembly, the righteous LORD, who loveth Righteousness, has a perfect Knowledge of it.</P>
<P>If obvious Measures to promote the Honour of GOD, the Interests of Religion, and the Relief and Prosperity of his People be neglected, it comes under his Observa∣tion: He was able, from His own Knowledge, thus to expostulate with the Congregation of the Mighty of old, <HI>How long will ye judge unjustly?</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 82. 2, 10 5.</NOTE> And this was His Complaint, <HI>They know not, neither will they understand, they walk in Darkness, all the Foundations of the Earth are out of Course.</HI> In short, He is thoroughly acquainted with all the Sins of this <HI>Assembly,</HI> whether of Omission or Commission.</P>
<P>And indeed, this His <HI>Inspection</HI> is very <HI>awful;</HI> for it is in order to a <HI>future Account,</HI> which He will exact of the Rulers of the Earth: <HI>The Great, as well as Small, must stand before His enlightned Tribunal:</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 12.</NOTE> Though Rulers <HI>are called Gods,</HI> yet they <HI>must die like Men</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 82. 6, 7.</NOTE>. <HI>The Breath even of Princes goeth forth, and after Death is the Judgment</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 46 4.</NOTE>. The exalted Potentates of the Earth are accountable to Him, who is higher than the highest: And with GOD there will be no Respect of Persons: He will judge <HI>impartially;</HI> and none of the <HI>Distinctions,</HI> which make a Difference between Men in this World, will be regarded at the <HI>last Day;</HI> but every Man shall be treated according to his Works, whether he be high or low, rich or poor.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="005737_0014_1026D4638420A7E8"/>
And if the <HI>Great GOD</HI> takes Cognizance of what is <HI>amiss</HI> in the Assembly of <HI>Civil Rulers,</HI> besure He doth of what is <HI>pleasing</HI> to Him. He observes the Integrity, the Diligence and the Faithfulness of those who sit in the Assembly of the Mighty: He beholds their Patience and Self-denial, their publick Spirit, and the agreeable Ap∣plication of their Talents; the good Improvement they make of their superior Accomplishments, and their pe∣culiar Opportunities to do Good, and singular Advan∣tages to serve the Honour of His Name in their exalted Stations, and to approve themselves publick Blessings: They may address Him in the Words of Governour <HI>Nehemiah, Think upon me, my GOD, for good, according to all that I have done for this People</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neb.</HI> 5 19.</NOTE>.

<P N="2">2<SUP>dly</SUP>, The great GOD is present in the Assembly of Political Rulers <HI>influentially.</HI></P>
<P>He has a tender Regard for <HI>human Societies;</HI> and in order to their Safety, Peace and Prosperity, establishes and preserves <HI>Government</HI> in them: He furnishes them with Rulers: The raising up Persons of this Character is His Work, <HI>The Powers that be, are ordained of Him</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 1.</NOTE>. <HI>The Shields of the Earth are His</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 47. 9</NOTE>. <HI>By Him Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice: By Him Princes rule, and Nobles, yea, all the Judges of the Earth</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 15 6.</NOTE>.

<P>When He, who dwelleth between the <HI>Cherubims, shines forth,</HI> affords Light, gives Counsel and Direction in this Assembly, He is present in it by His Influences upon the Minds of His Servants. And is it not oftentimes so? Don't He lead them in a right and plain Path? He is the GOD of <HI>the Spirits of all Flesh</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> 16. 22.</NOTE>; and has an easy Access to the Souls, which He hath made; strengthens Men's thinking Powers and Faculties; scatters the Clouds which darken the Minds of Rulers, and irradiates their Understandings; leads them into such wise and prudent Measures as answer the great Purposes of <HI>Government:</HI> Under the illuminating Influences of Heaven they make good Laws, do <HI>Justice</HI> to Persons who complain to them of Grievances; project such <HI>Schemes,</HI> as greatly tend to the Peace, Safety and Prosperity of a People; are directed to Means conducive to their <HI>Defence,</HI> from the Insults and Depredations of their Enemies; and which issue in the <HI>Annoyance</HI> of those that rise up against them: We have had a late Instance of a great and good Pro∣jection of this Kind, form'd by the <HI>Government</HI> we are <HI>immediately</HI> under.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The great GOD is present in the Assembly of Political Rulers by His <HI>animating Influences.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005737_0016_1026D46A430B57B8"/>
<HI>Courage</HI> is an Endowment necessary in the <HI>Leaders</HI> of a People. Rulers should not be Cowards. When the LORD advanced <HI>Joshua</HI> to be Successor to His Servant <HI>Moses,</HI> He bid him <HI>be strong, and of good Courage</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Joshua</HI> 1. 6.</NOTE>. Unhappy is it for a People when they have Women and Children to govern them; those who are not only void of Political Wisdom, but Persons who are apt to be dis∣heartened at the Sight of Difficulties, and affrighted at the Appearance of Dangers: But happy is it when GOD provides strong Rods for the Scepter of them that bear Rule over a People. Civil Rulers should be steady and unmoveable, as the great <HI>Mountains,</HI> in just and good Proceedings, stedfast in the Discharge of the Duties of their superior Places, and ought with Intrepidity to pur∣sue what makes for the Welfare of the Publick, though they incur the ill Resentments of particular Men, and expose themselves to the Malignity of some People.</P>
<P>Now when they are resolute and couragious in the Discharge of their weighty <HI>Betrustments,</HI> it proceeds from the divine <HI>animating</HI> Influences: Being vigorously moved hereby, they had rather offend <HI>Men</HI> than the great and mighty Ruler of the Universe, whose <HI>Trustees</HI> they are; had rather preserve a good Conscience, than gratify ill Humours, and keep in good Terms with those who impertinently meddle with State-Affairs, and addict them∣selves to inspect the publick Administration, and find Fault with every Thing almost, which they themselves have not a Hand in. Being thus influenced by <HI>Heaver,</HI> the Pilots of a <HI>Province</HI> won't baulk their Duty, thro' a base Fear of being dropt out of their publick Character at the next <HI>Election:</HI> They had rather live <HI>neglected,</HI> and in an obscure private Capacity, than omit doing what appears to them to be for the publick <HI>Weal,</HI> or have a Hand in what they they think will be an <HI>Encroachment</HI> upon the <HI>Royal Prerogative,</HI> or Detrimental to the <HI>People,</HI> with whose Interests they are betrusted.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="005737_0017_1026D46E442B0C10"/>
As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which they have received from above will restrain them from lavishing away the Publick Mo∣ney, so they won't let a Projection drop, if they can help it, when the common Safety and Prosperity makes the Prosecution of it necessary. They will engage in chargeable Enterprizes, in Behalf of their People, trusting in GOD to give them an Ability in Time, to discharge the Expences arising therefrom. The <HI>Outcries</HI> of inconside∣rate People will not terrify them so much as to prove a Temptation to Unfaithfulness.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The great GOD is <HI>present</HI> in the <HI>Assembly</HI> of Political Rulers by His <HI>pacifick</HI> Influences.</P>
<P>When there is Peace among the Heads of a People it proceeds from Him: He is the GOD of Peace. He maketh Peace in the <HI>high Places</HI> of the Earth, and pre∣serves it among Rulers: By an <HI>Impression</HI> upon the Souls of Men, He creates and upholds a <HI>Harmony</HI> among them. When Love and a good Agreement subsists among Rulers, in their Essays to promote the common Welfare, it is evident, GOD is with them in a gracious Manner. How favourable is He to them, and to those who are under their Authority, when one Spirit and Soul appears to animate this Body of Men; and they are united in employing their <HI>Talents</HI> for the Honour of Him, from whom they have derived them, and the Good of the People, who are their Care and Charge? But on the other Hand, when there are Jars and a Misunderstand∣ing among Rulers, GOD absents Himself from them, as to His <HI>gracious</HI> Presence; and it bodes ill to this Assembly, and has a dark Aspect upon the Circum∣stances of a People. Where there is Envy and Strife among Persons of <HI>low Life,</HI> there is Confusion; but much worse is a <HI>Fire</HI> kindled and blown up in the Bowels of a <HI>Political</HI> Body: 'Tis a bad <HI>Omen,</HI> when this is the State of the <HI>Congregation of the Mighty:</HI> It presages ill to Rulers and Ruled: The Contrary is a Token for Good,
<PB N="19" REF="005737_0018_1026D470DBEF2368"/>
that GOD has a gracious Design and Purpose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> res∣pect to those who are in Authority, and them who are subject to them. A good Harmo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is the Strength, the Beauty and Glory of Societies, and especially of <HI>political Assemblies.</HI> A House divided against itself is a Place of <HI>Confusion,</HI> and in Danger of falling; and 'tis well if a <HI>Kingdom</HI> divided against itself is not brought to Ruin.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">(4.) When Rulers are <HI>patient</HI> and <HI>resigned,</HI> the great GOD is <HI>influentially present</HI> with them.</P>
<P>They have need of Patience and Resignation: The Occasions for the Exercise of these <HI>Vertues</HI> are many and various. The <HI>Labours and Fatigues</HI> of Government are very heavy, if it be faithfully attended: Sometimes the <HI>Schemes and Projections,</HI> which they form to promote the Publick Good, don't succeed according to their Hope and Expectation; the Smiles of Divine Providence don't accompany them, although they are most wisely adapted to bring about the End they are design'd for: This Disappointment calls for their Patience and Resignation to the Will of GOD. Sometimes their <HI>Way</HI> is so dark, encumbered and embarassed that they can't proceed with <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of Mind: And let them be never so diligent and faithful in serving the Publick, many will fault and reproach them: This is too often the Case. <HI>Moses</HI> was a Ruler of rare Accomplishments, he was a wise Man, and learned in all the <HI>Learning of the Egyptians,</HI> and was eminently faithful in his Post; yet were there some that disliked him, and were uneasy under his <HI>Conduct;</HI> their discontented Spirits moved them to an Insurrection against this excellent Servant of the LORD; there was a Confe∣deracy to throw off his <HI>Government:</HI> The great Cry was, that <HI>he took too much upon him;</HI> but GOD awfully re∣buked these bold and wicked <HI>Men.</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb</HI> 16</NOTE> When Civil Rulers are patient and resign'd under the uneasy and difficult

Things they meet with, from a Consciousness of the <HI>Divine over-ruling Providence,</HI> and their own <HI>Integrity,</HI> the great GOD is <HI>graciously present</HI> with them by His Influences upon their Spirits. He is the <HI>GOD of Pa∣tience</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> 15. 5.</NOTE>. They are the Words of the Apostle, <HI>Strength∣ned with all Might, according to His glorious Power un∣to all Patience and Longsuffering, with Joyfulness.</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Col.</HI> 1. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have considered, that the <HI>inspecting and influential Presence</HI> of the great GOD is in the Assembly of Political Rulers: I would observe,</P>
<P N="3">3<SUP>dly</SUP>, That His <HI>safe-guarding Presence</HI> is in this Assembly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Congregation of the Mighty</HI> is sometimes exposed to great Dangers. There are secret Plots and Devices, form'd against it by the Enemies of the <HI>Government,</HI> the Execution of which would be fatal and destructive to it. When GOD, who is knowing to all the Works of Dark∣ness, and has the wicked Contrivances of Men and Devils under His Observation, brings to Light <HI>treasonable Ma∣chinations</HI> against Government, He is <HI>graciously</HI> present with the Assembly of the Mighty: Thus was He <HI>present</HI> with the great Convention <HI>of our Nations,</HI> in the <HI>Reign of King</HI> JAMES <HI>the First;</HI> He wonderfully discovered the <HI>Gunpowder Treason,</HI> when it was ripe for Execution: In the <HI>Mount</HI> was GOD seen; the <HI>sudden</HI> Design was in an astonishing Manner detected, and the wicked In∣struments of it were brought to condign Punishment.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Enemies of a <HI>Government</HI> seek its Ruin by <HI>open Violence,</HI> by hellish <HI>Insurrections</HI> and <HI>Rebellions:</HI> But the supreme Ruler of the World, who sitteth in the <HI>Heavens,</HI> laugheth at their Attempts, maketh them as <HI>Chaff before the Wind; and His Angel chaseth them.</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="005737_0020_1026D47789066108"/>
This was the Case in our Nations, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1715. And we have had a <HI>late Instance</HI> of it: GOD's People have seen the <HI>Rebels</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> fleeing before the <HI>Mighty</HI> and <HI>Puissant</HI> DUKE of CUMBERLAND: Their Hands have not been able to perform their Enterprize. Blessed be the most high GOD, who <HI>granteth Deliverance, and giveth Salvation unto Kings,</HI> that the horrid <HI>Rebellion,</HI> conceived and formed in the <HI>Conclave</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> fostered and spirited up by the Courts. of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> hath been so far obstructed in its <HI>Progress:</HI> May it be utterly discouraged, and all the Sparks of it ex∣tinguished!</P>
<P>It remains now that I make some <HI>Application</HI> of what has been said.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1<SUP>st</SUP>. Is it most <HI>sit</HI> and suitable, that a <HI>Number</HI> should be concerned in the Civil Government of a People, what Cause have We to bless GOD, for the agreeable Politi∣cal <HI>Establishment</HI> which we are under.</P>
<P>The <HI>supream</HI> Government at Home, which we are the Subjects of, calls for our most hearty Gratitude to <HI>Heaven.</HI> That Form of Government is thought by many wise Men to be the Best, which is lodg'd in the Hands of a KING and <HI>Parliament;</HI> the best adapted for the Security and Advantage of a People: Should we not be very thankful for so good a <HI>Constitution?</HI> It has been once and again struck at, and the Subversion of it has been greatly attempted, the Liberties and Privileges of the <HI>British Realm</HI> have been in great Hazard; but the <HI>Gates of Hell,</HI> and Men of arbitrary Principles, have not been able to prevail against them: Being safe guarded by the kind and watchful Providence of GOD, they have continued unto this Day.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="005737_0021_1026D47B8DC705F8"/>
And what Reason have we to bless the great Ruler of the World, for the <HI>Charter-Privileges</HI> which we enjoy? That the Form of <HI>Government</HI> we are <HI>immediately</HI> under, is not oppressive. We are ruled by a GOVERNOUR who represents the KING, a Board of <HI>Councellers,</HI> chosen by and from among our-selves; and by a House of <HI>Repre∣sentatives,</HI> elected by the <HI>Freeholders</HI> of the respective <HI>Towns</HI> of the <HI>Province.</HI> It is of GOD, that our <HI>political</HI> Circumstances are so comfortable; We should rejoice in them, and give Him Praise, that it is our Lot to be subject to such a desireable Constitution: May we never be so imprudent and ungrateful to GOD and the KING, as to take any <HI>Steps,</HI> which may expose us to the Loss of our <HI>Charter;</HI> but let us be solicitous that we may enjoy it all our Days, and leave it as a most rich and valuable Inheritance to our <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<SUP>dly</SUP>, Is the <HI>inspecting Presence</HI> of the great GOD in the Assembly of political Rulers, then they ought to be greatly <HI>influenced</HI> by the Consideration hereof in all their Proceedings.</P>
<P>They should act up to <HI>Conscience,</HI> as remembering they are under His Eye, who is a <HI>Being</HI> of consummate <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Goodness.</HI> These divine Perfections, which He displays in the Government of the World, they should be concern'd to <HI>Copy.</HI> They should be Followers of Him, in the Exercise of the same Virtues and Perfections; hereby their Administrations will be highly pleasing to Him: But if they are conducted by Principles that are corrupt and vicious, He will behold it with Displeasure. The Presence of such a GOD, the Virtues which He discovers in the Government of His Creatures, should keep the Gods of the Earth under a proper <HI>Regimen.</HI> Shall not these Excellencies make them afraid? Shall not the Dread of a just and good GOD fall upon and influence them in all their Transactions? Shall it not engage them to the greatest Fidelity in the
<PB N="23" REF="005737_0022_1026D47DA4FCEEE0"/>
Services He requires of them? Shall not the Intention for which He takes <HI>Notice</HI> of their Actions, have a mighty Force to make them sincere and conscientious? Doth He <HI>inspect</HI> them, in order to the calling them to an Account, and rendering to them according to their Behaviour in the publick Capacity they sustain; and should not the Thought hereof oblige them to acquit themselves well in their exalted Stations, that they may escape His tremendous Rebuke, and through Grace, receive His transporting <HI>Well done, good and faithful Servant?</HI> Faithful Rulers shall receive a great and blessed Reward from Him, who knows their Services, and is acquainted with the Integrity of their Hearts: And when we lament the Loss we sustain by the Deaths of our wife, faithful and serviceable <HI>Patriots,</HI> may we not rejoice in their superior and peculiar Felicity; and particularly should we not refresh our Souls, in the midst of our <HI>Sorrow,</HI> by thinking of the distinguishing Glory, which is already, and will at the <HI>last Day</HI> be assigned, by the Grace of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, to the lately deceas'd Honourable <HI>Thomas Cushing,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> who up∣rightly employed his <HI>rare and sanctified Political Talents</HI> for the <HI>Honour</HI> of the great GOD, and in the Service of His People?</P>
<P>And will the Honourable <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who are to be concern'd in the important <HI>Elections</HI> of this Day, suffer me to say, Let the Consideration of GOD's <HI>inspecting Presence</HI> make a powerful Impression upon your Hearts, and govern you in the great Affair before you.

<P>And doth not <HI>Justice and Honesty</HI> enter into the Cha∣racter of a good Ruler?

<P>And is not <HI>Mercy,</HI> as well as <HI>Zeal and Justice,</HI> essential to a good Ruler? In Government <HI>Mercy</HI> must be mixt and blended with Justice.

<P>Finally, Is it not of great Importance that those who are chosen into His <HI>Majesty's Council,</HI> be Gentlemen of <HI>Sobriety and Religion?</HI> Are those so fit to govern others who don't govern their Passions and Appetites?

<P>A great <HI>Trust</HI> is reposed them, they need Help from above, for the right and acceptable Discharge of it: Being sensible hereof, it is of Consequence that they exercise Faith in the allsufficient GOD, through the great <HI>Mediator.</HI> GOD is able to guide the <HI>Guides</HI> of a People, to lead their <HI>Leaders,</HI> and give their <HI>Senators</HI> Wisdom; to animate and inspire them with <HI>Resolution</HI> and <HI>Courage;</HI> to fill their Souls with <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>pacifick Dispositions;</HI> and carry them through the weighty Affairs they are engaged in.
