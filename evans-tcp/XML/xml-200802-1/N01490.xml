<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>Deuteronomy XVII.18, 19.</BIBL>
<P>And it shall be when he sitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, he shall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests, the Levites.</P>
<P>And it shall be with him, and be shall Read therein all the Days of his Life: that he may Learn to Fear the Lord his God, to keep all the Words of this Law, and all these Statutes, to do them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN God chose Israel to be His peculiar People before all the Nations of the Earth, He gave them Laws, Statutes, &amp; Ordinances of several sorts : He gave them not only the Moral Law written on the <HI>Tables of Stone,</HI> at Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>; which was a Rule to direct them in the performance of those Duties which the Light of Nature had more imperfectly inculcated upon them : but He gave them also the Ceremonial Law, consist∣ing in sundry Rites and Ceremonies, to be used in their Religious Worship; most of
<PB N="2" REF="001769_0003_0FB825872A3C1E58"/>
which had a Typical reference unto the Mes∣siah to come, &amp; the Righteousness that He was to bring in, and so ceased with the coming of the Messiah. And moreover, besides these, God gave them also their Judicial or Common∣Wealth Law, which consisted in sundry Sta∣tutes, and Political Orders; directing how the Civil Affairs of their Common Wealth, as they were a Civil State, should be managed. Our Text and Context is a Branch of their Civil Law, and is God's Statute to Israel, de∣claring how their King, their Chief Civil Ruler, should bear &amp; behave himself in that high &amp; dignify'd Station, and how he should Qualify himself for that Post in the Govern∣ment of God's People, so as to attain the right Ends of Civil Government, and be God's Minister, for good to His People.</P>
<P>In the words of the Text we may observe two things more generally;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) God declares what the Chief Civil Ruler of His People shall do, or what he ought to do.</P>
<P N="2">(2) He renders a Reason why he shall thus do.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to what God requires the King the Chief Civil Magistrate to do; its in these words, <HI>When he sitteth on the Throne of his King∣dom, he shall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests, the
<PB N="3" REF="001769_0004_0FB82588EA691DE0"/>
Levites; And it shall be with him, and he shall Read therein all the Days of his Life.</HI> And here by a parity of Reason, this Command seems to be binding to all Inferiour Magistrates, tho' none but the Chief is expressed; for their Office is of the same kind, tho' their Power may be less in degree: And then the reason rendred to Enforce the Command, shews it to be as needful for all Inferiour Civil Rulers, to comply with this Com∣mand, as the Chief, for they have all need to fear the Lord their God, and to keep all His Statutes, to do them; and particularly that of Executing Judgment among His People, so as to be God's Minister for good to them; the great End of the Office of Civil Rulers, whether of higher or lower Degree. And in this Command of God, respecting Civil Rulers, there are two Branches.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That the King, the Chief Ruler <HI>should Write out a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests, the Levites.</HI> Here we may do well to observe, that this Origi∣nal Law, out of which the Ruler was to take a Copy, was not only the Moral &amp; Ceremo∣nial Law, but also the Civil or Judicial Law, which was to be the Rule of his Govern∣ment; and according to which he was to Execute Justice &amp; Judgment in Israel. This is plain, if we consider that the Civil Law,
<PB N="4" REF="001769_0005_0FB8258A5C2AF7D0"/>
as well as the Ceremonial, was laid up before the Priests, in the sides of the Ark of the Covenant, there to be kept from one Gene∣neration to another; as its written, Deut. 31.24, 25, 26. <HI>And it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing all the Words of this Law in a Book, until they were finished; that Moses Commanded the Levites that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying, Take this Book of the Law, and put it in the sides of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a Witness against thee.</HI> And this was more than the Moral Law, for that was reposited in the Ark, and not in the sides; as may be seen at large, in <HI>Deut.</HI> 10.2, &amp; 5.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The second Branch of the Command unto the Civil Ruler is, <HI>That he should keep this Copy he had taken by him, and should Read therein all the Days of his Life.</HI> The meaning seems to be, that he should often Read and Study this Law; and thereby get the Letter of this Law well fixed in his Memory, and his Understanding well inlightned as to the meaning and true intent of the Law; (both which frequent Reading and Study hath a tendency to promote.)</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>More generally</HI>; In the Words we may take notice of the Reason rendred, to En∣force this Command, and that is this; <HI>That he may learn to Fear the Lord his God, and to
<PB N="5" REF="001769_0006_0FB8258BBB7F8588"/>
keep all the Words of this Law, and all these Statutes, to do them.</HI> The general Nature of the Reason seems to be this; That he might by his own Practise, according to the Moral and Ceremonial Law, and by exercising his Power over the People, according to the Limitation of the Civil Law, shew himself to be one that fears God, and will be God's Minister for good to His People; (as <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4.) One that will take care that the Laws of God, and the good and wholesome Laws of the Common Wealth are kept: Which is the great End of the Office of all Civil Rulers, whether Supreme or Subordi∣nate; for they are all to be God's Ministers for good, such as bear not the Sword in vain, Revengers to Execute Wrath on them that do Evil.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE from the Words, on which I may insist is this;</P>
<P>That the frequent Reading and Studying the Scriptures, and the Civil Law of the Common Wealth, is a thing very Needful and Profitable, for Civil Rulers in order to a right Execution of their Respective Civil Offices.</P>
<P>For Illustration of the Doctrine, it may be needful to State and Answer one Enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001769_0007_0FB8258D3B6E2450"/>Quest. <HI>Wherein consisteth the right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office</HI>?</P>
<P>Precedent to the Reply unto this Enquiry, it may be premised, That Civil Rulers, in the Discourse under management, are to be taken in a limited sense; only as they are vested with Executive Power of Government and not Legislative; not as they may be con∣cerned with Legislative Power in Govern∣ment. This we may take notice of in the whole of the following Discourse. This being premised, I answer the Question stated, (1.) More generally. (2.) More particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>More gen.</HI> The right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office lyeth, in their well Go∣verning of a People subject to their Autho∣rity, according to Just and Good Laws, so as to be God's Ministers for good to them. It is not meerly in Ruling a People, but in Ru∣ling them by good and wholesome Laws, keeping within the due limits of their Power in Government. All Civil Rulers have their Power of Government limited, and that by the Boundaries of some Laws, that are the Laws of that Kingdom, State or Common Wealth, over which any particular Ruler or Rulers are set to Govern. All just Govern∣ment, whether it be Monarchie or Popular, or
<PB N="7" REF="001769_0008_0FB825901C301C38"/>
a Mixture of both, or of any other differing Form; is originally founded in either Com∣pact or Conquest (where the War is just on the Conquerors part:) Now when &amp; where its founded originally in Compact or Agree∣ment, between the parties Ruling and Ruled, there must necessarily be supposed some Rules agreed upon which the Ruler is bound to take notice of, in his exerting Power of Government over the Ruled; for as none can make a just Claim to any Natural Ori∣ginal Right to Rule over others, (Family Rulers only excepted) so Mankind never did nor will, Submit themselves voluntarily to the Government of others their Fellow∣Men; but upon some Agreement of what Rules, the Ruler or Rulers should observe in Government; which Rules are the Laws of that Kingdom or State so Covenanting to be under Government; and in such Go∣vernment founded thus Originally in Com∣pact; the right Execution of the Civil Ru∣lers Office lyeth in the impartial &amp; upright Administration of Justice among such a People, according to these Rules. And a∣gain; When and where the Government of any Civil State, is originally founded in Con∣quest, (which may be a Just Government, where the War is Just on the Conquerors part) yet there God hath not Left such Con∣nqueror
<PB N="8" REF="001769_0009_0FB82591A04DBEB0"/>
at his liberty, what Laws to impose upon his Conquered Subjects, but hath obli∣ged him to institute good Laws for the Rule of his Government, for he is bound to be God's Minister for good to the People, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4. A revenger to execute Wrath upon them that do evil, and not on them that do good; and so his Laws must be correspondent to the Laws of God, and so good. Neither hath God left it at such Conquerors liberty, when he hath instituted good Laws, whether he will keep to them, as the Rule of exert∣ing his Executive Power in Government, or no: but he is as much bound to Govern by such good Laws as to make them; <HI>for he that Ruleth over men, must be Just, Ruling in the fear of the Lord.</HI> This the Rock of Israel hath said, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.3.</P>
<P>But more <HI>Particularly</HI> to Resolve the En∣quiry before us, we Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. The right Execution of the Civil Ma∣gistrates Office, partly consisteth in preserving promoting, &amp; maintaining <HI>Peace</HI> among the People over whom they are set to Rule; and to do this by executing good and wholesom laws made for that end. One great end of the Civil Rulers Office is Peace; that Peace might be kept was one end for which God appointed and approveth of Civil Govern∣ment. Peace is a very valuable and choice
<PB N="9" REF="001769_0010_0FB82593280A07D0"/>
outward Mercy; and therefore the Spirit of God, in the Hundred &amp; Thirty Third <HI>Psalm,</HI> compares it to the Odoriserous Anointing Oil, <HI>that ran down upon Aarons Head &amp; Beard, even to the skirts of his Garments.</HI> Now mens Lusts Interrupt the stream of this Choice Blessing; as <HI>James</HI> faith, Jam. 4.1. <HI>Whence come Wars and Fightings, but from your Lusts</HI>? And thus every Kingdom &amp; Country would be in an Uprore, and rush quickly into in∣evitable Ruine, if there was not some Ma∣gistrate in the Land to keep the Peace. And therefore God hath appointed such an Office among men; and men themselves have seen it needful every where, to set up some Forms of Civil Government for this End. Paralel here unto are we commanded, in I Tim. 2.1, 2. <HI>To Pray for Kings, and all in Places of Au∣thority; that under them we may lead quiet and Peaceable Lives.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office, partly consisteth, in their obliging men subject to their Authority, to <HI>Worship God</HI> according to Divine lnstitution, so far as they are enabled to do it, by virtue of any Civil Law of the Common Wealth over which they Rule The Civil Magistrate is rightly styled, <HI>Custos utriusque Tabula</HI>; The Keeper of both Tables. Its as much within his Pro∣vince to see that Men under his Authority,
<PB N="10" REF="001769_0011_0FB825949E49B920"/>
attend First Table Duties to God, as to ob∣lige them to Second Table Duties; as Du∣ties of Righteousness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> towards their Fel∣low Men. Thus the good King <HI>Asa</HI> did; as we find, in 2 Chron. 14.3, 4. <HI>He took away the Altars of the strange gods, and the high places,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their Fathers, and to do the Law and the Commandment.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The right Execution of the Civil Ma∣gistrates Office, consisteth partly in rendring such <HI>Rewards</HI> to the Righteous and Vertuous in the Land, as they may by Law; and espe∣cially in shielding them from those Injuries, Oppressions &amp; Violence, that they are liable to, and may be in danger of: and most cer∣tainly to acquit them, in Judgement when ever the Righteous and Vertuous, happen to be Arraigned at the Tribunal Bar under the supposition, and accusation of Guilty persons, as Violaters of the Laws. The Civil Rulers are as much bound in Duty as Officers in the Civil State, to Justify the Righteous in Judgment, as to Condemn the Wicked. Both were incumbent on the Judges in Israel, by one and the same Command; as Deut. 25.1. <HI>If there be a Controversie between men, and they come to Judgment, that the Judges may Judge them, then they shall Justify the Righteous, and Condemn the Wicked.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="11" REF="001769_0012_0FB82599781F8208"/>4. The right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office, in part lieth in the <HI>Condemning</HI> &amp; <HI>Pun∣ishing</HI> according to the Rule of the Law, those that are guilty of breaking the good &amp; whol∣som <HI>Penal Laws</HI> of the Land; especially if the Transgression be a Violation of any <HI>Moral Precept,</HI> so that the Criminal hath transgressed the Law of GOD, as well as the good and wholesom Laws of the Government; then the Civil Ruler with <HI>Phineas</HI>'s Zeal and re∣ligious Fortitude, should take up the righteous Javelin of the Law, and finite through the Loines of such workers of Iniquity; that all <HI>Israel</HI> may hear and fear, and do no more so Wickedly: In thus doing, the Civil Ruler becomes God's Minister for good; as <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4 A revenger to execute Wrath upon them that do evil. The Civil Ruler doth rightly execute his Office in such Cases, when he acteth without fear of offending any but God; and without indulgent affection on the score of Consaguinity or Affinity; after the Example of that Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> in the Wil∣derness at Mount-<HI>Sinai,</HI> when Israel was fallen to Idolatry; of whom it is recorded, in <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.9. That with reference to Executing Judgment for God; <HI>he said of his Father, and his Mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his Brethren, nor knew his own Children.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="001769_0013_0FB8259B8CF64C60"/>5. The right Execution of the Civil Ru∣lers Office in part, consisteth in their making a right and just Decision of <HI>Controversies,</HI> in matters of <HI>Meum &amp; Tuum,</HI> depending between Persons that are subject to their Authority, &amp; that according to the rules of the Law One End of Civil Government, is, That Contro∣versies of a Civil Nature might be well issued, and that men might not be Judges in their own Cases, &amp; endeavour to right themselves, <HI>Vi &amp; Armis</HI>; when they think they are wronged, which would be destructive to any State: And therefore God hath instituted the Civil Magistrates Office among men, and set up Rulers, that they might Judge righte∣ous Judgment between a Man &amp; his Neigh∣bour, and issue the Quarrel by a righteous Sentance, binding to both Parties. This was God's Command by <HI>Moses</HI> to the Seventy Elders, that they should Judge Righteously in Controversies of this nature; as we see in <HI>Deut.</HI> 1.16. <HI>And I charged your Judges at that time, saying Hear the Causes between your Bre∣thren, Judge Righteously between every man and his Brother, &amp; the Stranger that is with him.</HI> And in this kind of Executing Civil Power the Judges should not respect Persons, but Causes only: The <HI>Rich</HI> Should not be favoured in Judgment, because he is <HI>Rich</HI>; nor the <HI>Poor</HI> carry his Cause to his mind because he is <HI>Poor,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001769_0014_0FB8259D0A54B6E0"/>
when the right according to the Rules of the Law is not on his side; neither should the <HI>Vertuous</HI> man gain Judgment in his favour, be∣cause he is <HI>Vertuous</HI>; nor the <HI>Vicious</HI> man loose the Cause because he is <HI>Vicious</HI> (in matters of a Civil concern) when the Law discovers the right to be on his side. The rule given by <HI>Moses,</HI> to the Judges in <HI>Israel,</HI> was; as in <HI>Deut.</HI> 1.17 <HI>Thou shalt not respect Persons in Judg∣ment; but shall hear the small as well as the great.</HI></P>
<P>This Enquiry being Resolved in some mea∣sure; the thing that is next to be attended, is the Proving of the Doctrine in both the Branches of it.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>That the frequent Reading &amp; Stu∣dying the Scripture, is a thing Needful and Profi∣table for Civil Rulers, &amp;c.</HI> This will appear if we Consider these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. By frequent Reading and Studying the Scripture, Civil Rulers will be likely to be men of Religion &amp; good Conscience: And Religion is very serviceable to the regular managing the affairs of Civil Government. It was told <HI>Timothy,</HI> in 2 Tim. 3 15. <HI>That the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, was able to make him wise to Salvation.</HI> Now, if Rulers become wise to Salvation, thro' the knowledge of the Scriptures, gain'd by reading &amp; study; they will be Wise also in ordering the Affairs of
<PB N="14" REF="001769_0015_0FB8259E82727700"/>
Civil Government under their care; or will order them the more Wisely. If Rulers are men really Godly, have &amp; maintain the true Fear of God before their eyes; they will en∣deavour to execute their respective Offices well, so as to attain the right ends of Civil Government: As <HI>Nehemith</HI> said of his Bro∣ther <HI>Hanani,</HI> Neh. 7.2 That he gave him Charge over <HI>Jerusalem, Because he was a faith∣ful man, and one that feared God above many.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By frequent Reading and Studying the Scriptures, Civil Rulers may learn how to ex∣ert their Civil Power aright, for the glory of God &amp; the good of the People. It is set down in the Scriptures, what is the Nature &amp; End of the Civil Magistrates Office: As in Rom. 13.3, 4. <HI>Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good, &amp; thou shalt have praise of the same: For he is the Minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be a∣fraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: For he is the Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that doth evil.</HI> So in Lev. 19.15. <HI>Ye shall do no Unrighteousness on Judgment; thou shall not respect the person of the Poor, nor honour the person of the Mighty: but in Righteousness shalt thou Judge thy Neighbour.</HI> So in a Chron. 19.6, 7 <HI>And said to the Judges, take heed what ye do: for ye Judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is
<PB N="15" REF="001769_0016_0FB825A115E3BE98"/>
with you in the Judgment. Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed &amp; do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of Persons, nor taking of Gifts.</HI> Thus when Civil Rulers, learn their Duty as Rulers out of the Scriptures, they are the more likely to well execute their respective Offices; and thus Reading &amp; Studying the Scriptures, is a thing very needful, &amp; profitable for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. The frequent Reading and Study of the Scriptures keepeth fresh in the Memory of Rulers, the Examples of sundry Good Rulers in old time, whose Examples of right Ruling, are recorded in the Scriptures for Imitation. And as Examples, are more prevalent than Precepts, in some things; so they are not without their usefulness in the affairs of Civil Government. The Record of the Examples of those good Rulers of old, and the Blessings that followed them as a Reward of their Faithfulness in Government, hath a great tendency to influence the minds of present Rulers, to a vigorous discharge of their Duty, as such; that they may be the recipient Sub∣jects of the same Blessings. And thus Read∣ing and Studying the Scriptures is a thing needful &amp; profitable for all Rulers, Supreme or Subordinate. The Scripture Examples of good Rulers are those, of <HI>David, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah</HI>; and other Godly Kings, who Ruled
<PB N="16" REF="001769_0017_0FB825A249081688"/>
well; and God show'red down many Blessings upon them. Its peculiarly observable in <HI>Je∣hoshaphat</HI>'s case, in 2 Chron. 17.5, 6. <HI>That he had Riches &amp; Honour in abundance.</HI> And this seems to be sent from God, as a reward for his good Service in Government: For it's said in the foregoing words; <HI>That he sought the Lord God of his Fathers, &amp; walked in His Commandments,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and therefore the Lord established him in the King∣dom, and all Judah brought him Presents; and he had Riches and Honour in abundance.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The frequent Reading &amp; Studying the Scriptures, impresseth on the minds of Rulers those accounts of Evil Rulers, in old time, recorded in the Scriptures, &amp; the Judgments of God that fell upon them, for their Sins and Errors in Government; which hath a ten∣dency to disswade present Rulers, whether Su∣perior or Inferior, from the like evil practises in Government, left being found in the like Sins, the like Judgments should alight upon them also: For those things written in for∣mer times, were for our admonition &amp; cauti∣on, as well as some of them for our imitation. And thus the Reading &amp; Studying the Scrip∣tures, is needful &amp; profitable for Rulers. In the Scriptures there is Recorded the wicked Reigns of <HI>Jereboam, Ahab, Ahaz,</HI> &amp; <HI>Zedekiah</HI>; and other Ungodly Kings &amp; Rulers, on whom the wrath of God fell in the terrible effects of it in out∣ward
<PB N="17" REF="001769_0018_0FB825A3A0343F58"/>
Judgments, brought on them and their Houses; for their wickedness in Government. Very Remarkable is <HI>Ahab</HI>'s case; who by a wicked act in Government had disseised righ∣teous <HI>Naboth</HI> of his Vineyard, &amp; his Life also: but God meets him by his Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI>; as in I <HI>King.</HI> 21.19. Upon the same spot of ground he had so unrighteously gotten, with a dread∣ful Threatning, which came exactly to pass; <HI>in the place where the Dogs licked the blood Na∣both, there shall they lick thy blood, even thine.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Scriptures containeth a Body of Po∣litical Statutes, which altho' they were insti∣tuted by God as the Civil Law of the Com∣mon Wealth of <HI>Israel</HI> only; yet many of them are of a general Nature, and are founded in natural Equity; and so are as suitable for o∣ther Nations, States &amp; Kingdoms, as for God's <HI>Israel</HI> of old; conformable unto which, sundry Christian Nations, (and ours in particular) have fram'd many of their Civil Laws. So that upon this account the frequent Reading and Studying the Scriptures brings the Civil Ruler to a better understanding of the Civil Law, the Rule of right exerting Power of Government; and so is Needful and Profita∣ble for all Civil Rulers.</P>
<P>Most of our own Laws, called <HI>Capital Laws,</HI> are exactly the same, with the Law given to <HI>Israel</HI> in those cases; and sundry other of our
<PB N="18" REF="001769_0019_0FB825A5EB6D8DC0"/>
Laws are conformable to, and framed out of the Reason of those Laws recorded in the Scripture; and so the Reading &amp; Studying the Scriptures is very Needful and Profitable for our Rulers, in order to know and understand the Rule by which they are to Govern us; without the knowledge of which, they can never rightly Execute Judgment for God and for the Good of His People.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>That the frequent Reading and Studying the Civil Law of the Land, is a thing very Needful &amp; Profitable for Civil Rulers.</HI> This will appear if we Consider these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Knowledge and right Understand∣ing of the Law, cometh by Reading &amp; Study. <HI>Homo fit Doctus non vi sed sepe Legendo</HI>: And the Knowledge of the Law is so needful a thing for Civil Rulers to have; that they can not rightly execute their Civil Office without it: They cannot do Justice &amp; Judg∣ment without it (except it be by accident, as a blind man may chance to hit the mark) for the Law being the Rule they are to at∣tend in Judgment, (and that they are Sworn to attend) how can they do Justice, accord∣ing to this Rule, unless they know it? In all affairs whatsoever, its needful that men know the Rule by which they are to act, otherwise its as likely their actions will be irregular as
<PB N="19" REF="001769_0020_0FB825A75F179458"/>
regular. One reason why there is a Wo, pronounced upon that Land, whose King is a Child, (as <HI>Eccl.</HI> 10 16.) is because being a Child in Knowledge, he can't understand the Law the rule of his Government, and so can't rightly sway his ruling Rod; for want of which, the Kingdom will be in a sad case; and in danger of utter Ruine: Likewise when the Rulers of any People are Children in the Knowledge of the Law; that Land is in danger of Ruine: For however good the Law is, which is the great Bulwark to secure Reli∣gion, Life, Liberty and Property to the Sub∣ject; since its but a dead Letter, if the Ruler or Rulers don't understand it, the Common Wealth is in a sad case; the best Subjects in all their best Enjoyments, stand upon a very fickle, uncertain and dangerous Foundation: <HI>The malicious Transgressor riseth up, and no man is sure of his Life; as Job</HI> 24.22. And the wicked trespass or riseth up, and no man is sure of his Inheritance; tho' there be the best Laws in the world to defend it; because he that is to Execute the law is a meer <HI>Child in Knowledge,</HI> and doth not know that righteous Rule by which Controversies are to be de∣cided.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Knowledge of the Civil Law which cometh by Reading &amp; Study, is a thing very needful &amp; profitable for Civil Rulers, in that
<PB N="20" REF="001769_0021_0FB825AC71E49D10"/>
hereby they are enabled to weigh with a just Balance, those Pleadings of the Law that are frequently offered to their Consideration, when they are setting on the Seats or Judg∣ment; so as to reject Error tho' in never so fine a Dress; and to receive Arguments of Truth, and be swayed thereby, tho' not set off with so much flowrish of Words. If men that are Rulers and Judges don't know the Law, they are easily imposed upon, by more knowing Advocates, that sometimes have a bad Cause to manage; and so in the issue the matter is brought to that fatal Catastrophe, that the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> Complaineth of, in Isa. 59.14. <HI>Judgment is turned away backward, Justice standeth afar off, Trush is fallen in the Streets, and Equity can not enter.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Knowledge of the Law of the Land which comes by Reading and Study, is need∣ful and profitable for Civil Rulers; in that this good Knowledge gives them good Cou∣rage and Fortitude of Mind; or at least hath a tendency so to do, without which its a very difficult task for the Civil Magistrate to Ex∣ecute his Office aright. If Rulers are afraid on the Seats of Judgment, there is but a little or no Likelihood of their bearing the Sword of Justice, so as to make others Fear; so as to be a Terror to Evil doers: And if Rulers have but little knowledge in the Law the
<PB N="21" REF="001769_0022_0FB825AD65399A20"/>
Rule by which they are to Govern, and be Persons of so much common Sense as to know they know but little, it hath a natural ten∣dency to make them afraid, when in the Ex∣ercise of their Civil Power, so every threat∣ning Word from a bold &amp; sawcy Delinquent, which a wise Judge wou'd Curb and Punish, is such a Lion in the way, to the ignorant Ruler, that it brings him to <HI>a ne plus Ultra</HI>; he dare proceed no further: And so the daring Criminal Offender passeth with Im∣punity.</P>
<P N="4">4. Reading and Studying of the Law, is a thing needful and profitable for Civil Rulers, in that God hath seen meet to Enjoyn it on the Chief Ruler in <HI>Israel,</HI> even the King upon the Throne; and for such Reasons as make it as needful for all Inferiour Rulers. That which God doth Command Rulers to do, as Needful, none may say is Needless: Now God expresly Commandeth, as in our Text; <HI>That the King when he sitteth on the Throne of his Kingdom, should write him a Copy of the Law in a Book; and it should be with him, &amp; he should Read therein all the Days of his Life; that he might learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all these Statutes, to do them.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Reading and, Studying the Civil Law of the Land, by which Knowledge is at∣tained, is a thing very needful and profitable
<PB N="22" REF="001769_0023_0FB825AF39EA5EC8"/>
for Rulers; in order to keep up their Credit &amp; Reputation among the People over whom they are to Rule; without which they can't be very Serviceable as Rulers, in their Places. When the People have a contemptible low Thought of the Ruler, and esteem him as a man of little or no Knowledge in the Law, the Rule of Government; they but little Re∣gard him, or his Civil Commands, how Just so ever they are, and but a little do they Re∣gard the Punishments that the Law layeth upon Transgressors, how great so ever they are; since they Esteem him that is to Exe∣cute the Law a meer Child in Knowledge, whom they think they can easily delude or affright; And so the great End of Civil Go∣vernment is in a manner Lost, and the Ruler very Unserviceable in his Place.</P>
<P>Having endeavoured to Illustrate &amp; Con∣firm the Doctrine in both the Branches of it. I would make some suitable Improvement; and that in several Uses.</P>
<P>USE, I. Of INFERENCE or IN∣STRUCTION, in a few Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence we may learn, <HI>That the Civil Ma∣gistrates Office well Executed, is that which re∣quires or calls for great Labour &amp; Pains.</HI> Idle∣ness we may see is inconsistent with the
<PB N="23" REF="001769_0024_0FB825B06F2B5140"/>
right discharge of Duty in a Civil Ruler. Frequent Reading &amp; Studying, the Scriptures and the Civil Law of the Common Wealth which the Doctrine sheweth, is so needful for the Civil Ruler, is Laborious. <HI>Solomon</HI> well observes, in Eccl. 12.12. <HI>That much Study is a weariness to the Flesh.</HI> He that will Qualify himself for a good Ruler, must take Pains. He that thinks a man may be Qualified for the Office of a Civil Ruler without Reading and Study, which takes up Time, and costs Labour &amp; Pains is much mistaken. Rulers are to bear the weight of Government upon their Shoulders; the smaller Vessels the lesser Subjects, are to have their dependance upon them, to preserve them from those injurious Oppressions and other Mischiefs that they are liable unto: In this sense they are to be as Nails fastened in a sure place, on which they hang the smaller Vessels. As was said of <HI>Eliakim,</HI> a Chief Ruler in <HI>Judah,</HI> in Isa. 22.22, &amp; 24. <HI>I will fasten him as a Nail in a sure Place,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And they shall hang upon him all the Vessels of smaller quantity.</HI> Now what Sup∣port can the Civil Ruler afford to the smaller Vessels the lesser Subjects, that have their dependnnce upon him, for Security &amp; Safety, many ways, unless he be a man of Know∣ledge? And how can Knowledge be attain∣ed, without Reading &amp; Study? <HI>Nemo sapiens
<PB N="24" REF="001769_0025_0FB825B205669950"/>
nascitur.</HI> And Reading &amp; Study is Laborious. So upon the whole we see that the Civil Ru∣lers Office well Executed is Laborious.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence we infer, <HI>That men who are care∣less in Reading and Studying the Scriptures, and know but little of the Mind of God contained in the scriptures; are not fit for Civil Rulers.</HI> Hence we may learn, that all Persons of Atheistical Principles, are unfit for Rulers; and so are all Persons grosly Ignorant of the Scriptures: also all Irreligious Persons, who shew by their Practical Ungodliness, that they are Unac∣quainted with the Law of God that Con∣vinceth &amp; Converteth the Soul, Enlightens the Mind, and maketh Wise the Simple. If Rulers don't fear God, (which is gain'd in great part by the frequent use of the Scrip∣tures) what may be expected from them, but that as often as they can do it, and pass with impunity, (which they have great advantage for, considering the Sphere of E∣levation which they are placed in) <HI>they will Sell the Righteous for Silver, and the Poor for a Pair of Shoes</HI>? Which the Prophet <HI>Amos</HI> complaineth of, (in <HI>Amos.</HI> 2.6.) as the sad Custom of those Evil Times. <HI>Abraham</HI> ex∣pected no Justice would be done him in <HI>A∣bimelech</HI>'s Court, but rather that he should be Slain, tho' an innocent Man; not because of
<PB N="25" REF="001769_0026_0FB825B389C6AB98"/>
the want of Civil Government in that Coun∣trey, for that there was, and <HI>Abimelech</HI> was Chief Ruler at that time; but the reason of his fears and sad expectation, arose from an apprehension he had that there was not the fear of God in that Place; as we may see in Gen. 20.11. <HI>Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this Place; and they will Slay me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3 Hence we may be further instructed, <HI>That it is not every good Man, who doth really fear God; that is fit for a Civil Ruler</HI>: For some such have little or no Knowledge of the Law of the Common Wealth, which Rulers are Bound, nay Sworn to attend in Government; and so not fit, And many times the case is so with some good Men, that they can't qua∣lify and fit themselves for good Rulers, tho' men of natural good Abilities; for the case is so circumstanced with them, that they can't find Time to gain Knowledge in the law, the Rule of Civil Government; which Knowledge comes by Reading and Study: For their Secular occasions, needful to be at∣tended in order to Support themselves and their Families in this World, ingrosseth all their Time; except so much as is requisite for Natural Comforts, and Religious Du∣ties; and so if power of Government should
<PB N="26" REF="001769_0027_0FB825B4E134C738"/>
be devolved on them, <HI>they cannot be Strong Rods for Scepters to bear Rule.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hence we learn, <HI>That Rulers should spend Time and deep Tho't upon the Scriptures and the Civil Law of the Land; in or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r to a right Ad∣ministration of Juftice: as well as to spend what Time is needful in Hearing &amp; Determining Causes that come before them in Judgment.</HI> Prelimi∣nary Preparation in this way, is as needful, as Proceeding with Care and deliberate wise Counsels when they are upon the Seats of Judgment; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> indeed the latter is not like to be without the former. One Reason why God Commanded the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> as in our Text; <HI>To write him a Copy of the Book of the Law, and to keep it by him, and to Read therein all the Days of his Life</HI>; was, That he might have so well digested the whole Body of the Political Statutes contained therein, in his thoughts; that when he came to apply it to Particular Persons and Cases, he might not be at a loss, but might make a ready wise &amp; Just Decision of all Controversies, according to this Rule. If Judges come upon the Seats of Judgment unprepared as to any precedent Study of the Law; one of these Mischiefs ordinarily will ensue, Either Justice must be delayed, until the Judges have took time to Study the Law referring to such. Causes, as
<PB N="27" REF="001769_0028_0FB825B6A0C55BC8"/>
are depending before them; which is an in∣jury to the Subject, many ways: or else Judg∣ment must be given ignorantly, which is as like to be wrong, as right; and this will bring all Legal Decisions to a meer Chance, which will make the righteous Subjects whom the Laws should Secure and Protect, as unsafe in all their best Enjoyments, as if the Dice were cast for them.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence we learn, <HI>That the Civil Ruler should be a man of a good Estate, that he may be able to afford Time to be spent in Reading &amp; Study, in order furnish him with Knowledge in State Affairs, that he might serve the Publick the better.</HI> There are some Men that would make good Rulers, if that of Estate were not wanting: but for want of this, they are not only apt to be of mean and mercinary Spirits, but are also unable to spend that Time which is needful in Reading and Study, thereby to Treasure up Knowledge; and so they are upon this Consideration uncapable of being good Rulers. And when any Government finds it needful to place Persons in exalted Stations of Trust and Civil Power, who are of mean Estates; there should be some way found to supply that detect, by afford∣ing them such Supplies out of the. Publick Treasury, as may make it a thing seasable for
<PB N="28" REF="001769_0029_0FB825BCA73621B8"/>
them, to spend a convenient part of their Time, in Reading and Study that they may serve the Publick the better. And upon this Consideration of its being needful for Rulers to spend part of their Time (and so disad∣vantage their own Estates) in Reading and Studying the Law, that they may ad∣vantage the Publick Interest; <HI>and be God's Ministers for good to His People</HI>: I say upon this Consideration, it becomes a very just, Righteous and Reasonable thing, for the Ruled to Pay Tribute to Rulers: Rom. 13.6, 7 <HI>For this cause pay you Tribute also; for they are God's Ministers attending constinually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their Dues: Tribute to whom Tribute is Due,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>USE, II. Of EXHORTATION, unto several Ranks and Orders of Persons here Present,</P>
<P N="1">1. With all due Regards and utmost Hu∣mility, &amp; Sabmission, I would suggest, a few word of Exhortation to our <HI>Honourable and Worshipful RULERS; that now are or this Day may be fixed in the most Exalted Station of Civil Dominion in this Colony</HI>; as well as to all Subordinate Rulers, that have or may have a share in the Executive Power of Govern∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="001769_0030_0FB825BF218C39F0"/>Honourable, &amp; Worshipful, &amp; worthy Gentlemen;</P>
<P>The Exhortation that may be offered to you and each of you, as resulting from the Text and Doctrine under our management; may be Proposed in these following Particu∣lars.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Be pleased to take Time, in seriously Read∣ing and Studying the Scriptures, the Law of God that Convinceth and Converteth the Soul, that En∣lightneth the Mind, and maketh Wise the Simple.</HI> It is not to be imagined, that this Duty hath been grofly neglected by our Honourable &amp; Religious Rulers, and it is not under that apprehension, that the Counsel is now given: but as it lieth fairly in my way, at this time, having been shewing how needful and profi∣table it is for Rulers to frequently Read and Study the Scriptures. And here suffer me a few words. With all submission, let it be spoken to our Honourable Rulers; The greater Care, Time and Diligence is taken, by your selves in Reading and Studying the Word of God, the more likely it will be, that you will become Wise to Salvation; and the more capable you will be of doing GOD and the Government, good Service as Ruler; for in the Scriptures you learn the Art of Go∣verment; and there you have all manner of
<PB N="30" REF="001769_0031_0FB825C0E3144920"/>
Encouragement to the right Discharge of those Duties that are incumbent on you as Rulers: and that as a chief, &amp; notable Per∣swasive, that GOD will be with you; if you Zealously and Religiously attend your Duty as Rulers: As in 2 Chron 19.6. <HI>Ye Judge not for Man, but for God, who is with you in the Judgment.</HI> In the Scriptures you find the End of Civil Government, and what are the most proper Methods to be taken by Rulers, in order to attain this End; which may be a Motive to good Rulers to Converse much with the Scriptures, that they may be what God hath appointed them to be, His Ministers for good to His People.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>Be pleased to be frequently Reading &amp; Stu∣dying the Civil Law of the Land.</HI> Let a Copy of this Law, the Rule limiting your Power in Government, and teaching you how to Go∣vern; be with you, and Read therein all the Days of the Life of your Civil Power; that you may keep all the Statutes thereof, and do them; and may be the better able to ob∣lige all of us, Subject to your Authority, to keep those good and wholesome Laws like∣wise. I need not suggest it, to Persons of your Reason and Experience, that the Study of the Law is a large Field, in which many a Painful Step must be taken; and much Ob∣servation used, before we discover the utmost
<PB N="31" REF="001769_0032_0FB825C264567D80"/>
Boundaries of it: yet the Delight that is in it, to ingenious Minds, in your Stations▪ (<HI>Scire multum est Jucundissimum</HI>) Knowledge is most Pleasant: and the Profit that resolteth there from, unto your Selves, and to the whole Government under your Command, I hope will be an encouraging Motive thereunto; tho' the work may seem tedious and may re∣quire length of Time, depth of Tho't, and great Pains. I hope none will object, That our Civil Law is so plain and easie to be un∣derstood, that there needeth not much Time to be spent in the Reading and Study of it. For tho' the more the matter is look'd into, the more Knowledge will be gain'd, yet the more shall we find it to be, <HI>Durum opus est Difficile</HI>; an hard &amp; difficult Task. It is no∣so easy a thing to understand the right spirit and meaning of the Law, so as to be able to make a right Application of it, to all the various Persons and Causes, that come be∣fore the Judges on the Seats of Judicature, as some men vainly imagine. If any such Objection, as above stated shou'd be made, it may be Replied; That the Political Statutes which God gave to His <HI>Israel</HI> of old, were as plain &amp; easie to be understood, as any of the Laws of Nations of a later Date; and yet God did expresly Command that the King upon the Throne, the Chief of Executive
<PB N="32" REF="001769_0033_0FB825C3EE2CDCA0"/>
Rulers, and the Fountain of Executive Power, <HI>should write him a Copy of this Law in a Book; and should Read therein all the Days of his Life.</HI> Neither the Dignity of his Office, nor the Weight of his other Business should excuse him.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>Be humbly Exhorted to distribute Justice and Judgment among our several Tribes, and in all our Gates, according to this Rule, the Law.</HI> Let the Law Study'd &amp; Understood by you, and each of you, be the Rule and Measure of all your proceedings in Government: To this Rule you are limited by the Solemn Oath of God upon you; and by your virtual Co∣venant with the People, by whose Suffrages, you are designed to those Places of Power and Trust, that you are, or may be in. Let neither fear of Offending some, nor hope of Pleasing others; nor any other thing cause you to deviate from this Rule the Law, in any of your Civil Administrations. Let this be your peculiar Motto and Maxim of State, <HI>Fiat J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>itia ruit caelus</HI>; Let Justice be done what ever be the Event.</P>
<P>It will not surely be ungrateful, to recom∣mend to your serious Consideration, that Scripture; Deut. 1.16, 17. <HI>And I Charged your Judges at that time, saying, Hear the Causes be∣tween your Brethren, and Judge Righteously be∣tween every Man &amp; his Brother, &amp; the Stranger
<PB N="33" REF="001769_0034_0FB825C5DD423048"/>
that is with him. Ye shall not respect Persons in Judgment, but you shall Hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of the Face of Man; for the Judgment is God's.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4) <HI>Be pleased to shew a distinguishing Zeal for God &amp; His Cause, in bearing the Sword of Justice so, as it may be terrible to Evil Doers.</HI> In this you will do a great Service for God, and for His People also, even in severely Punishing according to the Law, those Wicked Men, who greatly Provoke God, by their high handed iniquities, and not only bring Wrath upon themselves; but are one principal me∣retorious Cause of those heavy Judgments, that from time to time, fall upon our Land. We read, Josh. 22.20. <HI>That one man Sinned, even Achan the Son of Zeri, and Wrath fell upon the whole Congregation of Israel; and that man perished not alone in his Iniquity.</HI> Those that thus Offend God, and bring Wrath upon His People, should be Punished by the Civil Ma∣gistrate according to the Merit of their Offences; and for this reason the Civil Ma∣gistrate is Armed with the Sword, that he might cut off from the Common wealth those Wicked Men, whose Crimes merit it; and who are (as gangren'd Members, to the na∣tural Body) infectious and destructive to the whole Body Politick. <HI>Ense reciderdum ut ne pars sincera trahatur immedicabile Vulnus.</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="001769_0035_0FB825C8FA3BCA88"/>
The incurable Limb must be cut off, left the whole Body be Ruined. Be pleased to in∣flict the Just punishments the Law hath al∣lotted, upon Criminal Offenders of every Kind, so, as you may be God's Ministers in this respect for good, Revengers to execute Wrath upon them that do evil; <HI>that all Israel may Hear and Fear, and do no more so Wick∣edly.</HI></P>
<P>Suffer me a few words by way of Motive here, in two Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">[1.] For Rulers to bear a severe Testimo∣ny against Sin, &amp; Sinners; is the ready way to bring on themselves and their Families a peculiar Blessing from God. See that Scrip∣ture; Numb. 25.12, 13. <HI>Wherefore, behold I give him my Covenant of Peace. And he shall have it,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Because he was Zealous for his God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">[2.] For Rulers thus to do, is the way to turn away God's Wrath from a Sinful People, &amp; to lengthen out their Tranquility: Numb. 25, 11. <HI>Phineas the Son of Eleazer, the Son of Aaron the Priest, hath turned away my Wrath, while he was Zealous for my sake among them.</HI> And so saith God by His Prophet of old; Jer. 5, 1. <HI>Run ye to and fro through the Streets of Je∣rusalem, and search in the broad Ways thereof, if ye can find a Man, to stand up &amp; execute Judg∣ment, and seek the Truth, and I will Pardon it.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="35" REF="001769_0036_0FB825CBEA199E50"/>2. In the Second Place by way of Exhor∣tion, I would make my humble Address, unto my <HI>Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the MINISTRY</HI>: And tho' it belongs not to us, to execute Judgment for God according to the Statutes of the Land, (as it belonged not to King <HI>Uzziah</HI> to burn Incense, but to the Priests the Sons of <HI>Aaron</HI>;) and so not so needful for us to Read &amp; Study the Civil Law: Yet as Ministers of CHRIST, and Stewards of the Mysteries of GOD, and Rulers in His House; it is very Needful and Profitable for us, to Read and Study the Scriptures, in the which the Law of CHRIST is contained. That ought to be the Rule of all our Sacred Administrations: <HI>Christ was not less Faithful in all his House, than Moses was in his.</HI> And HE is the great Le∣gislator, as well as the King of His Church. And in the Scriptures His Laws are contain∣ed, to which we must Conform as strictly in our Ministry and Government, as the Civil Ruler must Conform to the Civil Law, as the Rule of the Lawful Exercise of his Power. Let us therefore Painfully Study this Law of Christ in all the Parts of it; and make it the Rule of our Practise, in the performance of all the Duties of our Sacred Calling. To CHRIST our Great Lord and King, we must
<PB N="36" REF="001769_0037_0FB825CF314CE538"/>
ere long be Accountable; and the great En∣quiry then will be, Whether we have Regu∣lated all things, in the House and Worship of God <HI>according to the Pattern given in the Mount.</HI> Therefore let us <HI>take a Copy of this Law,</HI> in the Book of the Scriptures; <HI>and let it be with us, and let us Read therein all the Days of our Lives; that we may learn to fear the Lord our God, and to keep all His Commandments and his Statutes, to do them.</HI> In our Ministry and Government, let us bear a due Testimony against Sin, and Sinners; as did <HI>Phincas</HI> the Son of <HI>Eleazer,</HI> that God may <HI>Bless us, and Establish with us the Covenant of an Everlasting Priesthood, because we have been Zealous for His sake among His People.</HI> That bold and daring Transgressors, where the Sword of Civil Power doth not reach, or not sufficiently correct and amend, may be reached and slain by the Sword of the Word: That it may be, as was said, in 1 King. 19.17. <HI>Him that escapeth the Sword of Jehu, shall Elisha Slay.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Third Branch of Exhortation may be directed to all such, who according to the Constitution of our Government, are <HI>Electors of Rulers</HI>; either as they are <HI>Freemen of this Corporation,</HI> or as they are <HI>Members of that Representative Body of our Colony,</HI> to whom the Power of Electing Inferiour Rulers doth
<PB N="37" REF="001769_0038_0FB825D0B4B52DE8"/>
belong. The Advice to you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> is this; <HI>Take care to Choose such for Rulers whether Superiour or Subordinate, as are men of Religion, and Knowledge in the Laws.</HI> Such as Conscientiously Read and Study the Scrip∣ture and the Laws of the Land, that they may do God and His People good Service as Rulers; and be God's Ministers for good. Don't choose either Vicious Persons or Babes in Knowledge, to manage our State Affairs; such are not fit to have the Charge over our <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> or if they have it can they manage that Charge and Trust, as becomes good Rulers. And don't choose Men to Rule over us, meerly because they are your par∣ticular Friends, and will suit you in some of your particular Designs &amp; private Interests: Neither with-hold your Suffrages from any that are Men of Religion and Knowledge of the Laws, because they are not of your Faction, and will not suit with your private Humour and particular Interests. If you do guide your Choice by private Favour, Af∣fection or Faction, without regard to Publick Good; you will Violate the Solemn Oath of God upon you, and bring your selves under great Guilt; and can not answer it before God in the Great Day of Account. You ought herein to act in the fear of God, and discarding all respect to your Private Interest
<PB N="38" REF="001769_0039_0FB825D220F852A8"/>
and all Prejudice; aiming at God's Glory, and the Good of His People in general; and as God declares to the Rulers what they must do in order to Rule well; viz <HI>Write them a Copy of this Book of the Law, and Read therein,</HI> &amp;c. So those you observe most Con∣formable to this Duty which God requires of Rulers; they are the Persons for whom you should give your Suffrages when ever you are called to it.</P>
<P>To you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who are the <HI>Represen∣tative Body of our Colony,</HI> I would say one word in special; That altho' there may want some further good Laws to be made, for the Punishing of Sin, Immorality and Prophaneness, that are too much abounding in our Land (and if that be the Case, its your business to Exercise your Legislative Power for that end) yet it may be a matter more highly requisite in order to Reforma∣tion, to put good Laws already made, in due Execution: And your business herein, is to put into Place of Power, such Inferiour Ru∣lers throughout our several Tribes, as in their respective Stations, will put good Laws in due Execution. Such as know the Law, and so are such as crafty and bold Criminals, or their Advocates and Abetters can not, battle; and such as have learned the Fear of God out of the Scriptures, and are men of
<PB N="39" REF="001769_0040_0FB825D45FEF2008"/>
such Religious and Conscience, that they will be Zealous for God among His People, bear∣ing the Sword of Justice not in Vain; but so as to be God's Ministers for good, revengers to execute Wrath upon them that do evil.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Lastly,</HI> I would by way of Exhortation offer a few words, unto all those that are the <HI>Ruled,</HI> Subject to the Authority of Civil Rulers: And the Exhortation to you is, <HI>Take care to Keep the Laws of God, and the good and wholesome Laws of the Common Wealth.</HI> It is as much our Duty to keep the Laws, as its the Duty of our Religious Rulers to inflict the Punishments of the Law upon us in case we are the breakers of it.</P>
<P>And here more Particularly be Exhorted to discharge Four Points of Duty, respecting our Carriage towards our Rulers, which the Laws of God as well as the Laws of the Government make our especial Duty.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) To Honour and Regard them as our Civil Fathers; not Vilifying or Reproaching of them in any of our words or actions; as in Rom. 13.7. <HI>Render therefore to all their Duet,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Honour to whom Honour is due.</HI> So in Exod. 22.18. <HI>Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the Ruler of thy People.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) To Freely and Readily Pay them Tribute for their Serving us as Rulers, and
<PB N="40" REF="001769_0041_0FB825D8363A7240"/>
being God's Ministers to us for good: Rom. 13.6, 7. <HI>For this cause pay you Tribute also: for they are God's Ministers, attending continually on this very thing. Render therefore tribute to whom Tribute is Due.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) To Pray for them to the <HI>Eternal Lord Heaven and Earth,</HI> whose Vicegerents they are; that they may be acting in their sphere of Exaltation for God's Glory, &amp; our good. To this we are Commanded, 1 Tim. 2.2 <HI>Pray for King's, &amp; all in Place of Authority, that under them we may lead Quiet and Peaceable Lives, in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4) To Submit to them as they are God's Ministers to Rule over us, and have received their Power from GOD; and are called <HI>Gods</HI> from the dignity of their Office: which Submission we must render unto them as a Duty which God requires of us, so long as they keep within the limits of their Power in Ruling over us. And this we must do not only for fear of their Wrath, but for Conscience sake: For the Rule is, Rom 13.5. <HI>Wherefore ye must needs be Subject, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</HI> And God saith, in the Second Verse of the same Chap∣ter; <HI>Whosoever resisteth, resisteth the Ordinance of God: and shall receive to himself Damnation.</HI></P>
