<HEAD>LETTER 1.</HEAD>
<P>SIR John Denham, in his poem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cooper's Hill, says to the Thomas,
<Q><L>O could I saw like thee, and make thy stre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></L>
<L>My great example, as it is my theme;</L>

<L>Strong without rags, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stowing full</L></Q></P>
<P>And why may not I address myself<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in like manner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> CANDIDUS? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has, in a peculiar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my pride, and, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>

opinion of his benevolence, by his ge∣nerous opinion of the conduct and capacities of women in general. It is a constant matter of secret triumph to me, for any part of my sex to deserve honor from the judicious part of your's. The superiority of intellectu∣al faculties I am always ready to re∣sign to you; as masculine strength, and greatness of thought, are as un∣doubtedly your prerogative, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in the <HI>king's</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and I should as soon think of claiming one as the other; being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> convinced, in my own mind, of your charter in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> I have many times differ∣ed from ladies in opinion on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> perhaps one reason is, few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been more dependant on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> myself, in matters of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> felt my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in a thousand instances, since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been honored with your corres∣pondence:
<PB N="3" REF="024450_0006_0FC74DCD754037A8"/>
But though, as an indivi∣dual, I feel myself so very weak in in∣tellectual endowments, that I have but little right to any part of the noble compliments you make my sex, yet I am very glad there are many ladies now living who have; and being a link of the same chain, it is sufficient for me to enjoy their just praises.</P>
<P>The celebrated Mrs. Montagu, whom you mentioned to have heard spoken of with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh distinction, stands the first in the present class of female literati. I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, CANDIDUS. that you have not read her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on <HI>Voltaire,</HI> in her defence of <HI>Shakespeare:</HI> I will not anticipate your opi∣nion of that work, further than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and saying, I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have a pleasure to come, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> peruse it with due attention. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> several times I have been in company with this admirable lady, her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="024450_0007_0FC74DD5291B8F40"/>
has risen upon me; from observation of the refined tenderness, softness, and feminine qualities, that are characte∣ristic of <HI>woman;</HI> while she is justly and publicly allowed to be endowed with so great a share of the wisdom of <HI>man,</HI> that it proves, beyond contradic∣tion, it is not always the <HI>wig,</HI> nor the <HI>cap,</HI> that distinguishes the learning of the head it encircles.</P>
<P>You know <HI>Voltaire,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all his ta∣lents, was thought to be one of the most inconsistent men in the world. He greatly enriched himself, by the bounties of royalty, when he first came to England; and, we are informed, he did not hesitate to copy the finest thoughts and incidents of our dramatic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and translate whole scenes into his own language: Yes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he had conversed <HI>with,</HI> and written letters to, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word panegyrics on, the genius of the English poets, on his return to <HI>France:</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="024450_0008_0FC74DD8CA8FACA0"/>
yet, after all this, we are told, <HI>Voltaire</HI> did not scruple to say, "that <HI>Shake∣speare</HI> would never have been known out of his own country, as a poet, had he not condescended to pick up a few pearls from his enormous dunghill." Did not such a writer as this, who had learnt our language, and stole as much fire as he possibly could from an author he depreciated, deserve the se∣verity of criticism? Yes, I presume you will say; and an English lady, who had investigated <HI>Voltaire's</HI> plays with amazing penetration, and cool∣ness of judgment, gave the deservell laurels to our beloved <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> on due comparison of their respective me∣rit. Nor is it at all to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at, that such a truly great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mrs. <HI>Montagu</HI> possessed, should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> superlative pleasure in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> lies of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> It is con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="024450_0009_0FC74DDA3A432D28"/>
the French poet could not hear to hear of a rival, alive or dead, in dra∣matic excellence; which found was as dreadful to <HI>Volatire,</HI> as the name of <HI>Hector</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Greeks:</HI> Like the great <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Caesar,</HI> he could not brook an equal; for the Grand Turk is not more jealous of a competi∣tor in power, than <HI>Voltaire</HI> was of one of the quill.</P>
<P>But I hope, CANDIDUS, the amia∣ble and learned Mrs. <HI>Montagu,</HI> is but one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many, who can confute the Mahometan doctrine, and prove that woman have <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uls.</HI> Certainly them have been, and are numbers, that have written on subjects serious, abstruse, and entertaining; withers much instruction and enlivening spirit a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who have been studious to depreciate female endowments; and by that means to give us no high opinion of their own.

of the first converts to the gospel, and gloried in martyrdom for its sake. Providence has generally wise ends to answer in all its dispensations; and it must be ackowledged, that from the rich fountain of female learning, ma∣ny useful and noble streams have slowed to posterity; for no out but a cynic, or rough satyrist will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but that a liberal knowledge of letters may be of great advantage to women as well as men. As folly is the certain off-spring of ignorance, it is incompatible with true generosity of soul, to wish to setter the female mind in its attain∣ments, when so much happiness to so∣ciety depends upon its invigorating ex∣ample: But I believe men in general are much more jealous of their pre∣rogative in imputed wisdom, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in attaining its reality▪ For this reason they explode <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they call, learning
<PB N="9" REF="024450_0012_0FC74DE9608BB9E0"/>
in women, as an endowment which will only help the possessors to be very quick-sighted to the weakness of their opponents; and, therefore, like the Turks, they think that Empire safest, which is founded on ignorance. It is noble in you, CANDIDUS, to declare, that you don't wish <HI>the tree of know∣ledge</HI> to be monopolized <HI>by your sex only;</HI> nor do I wish it to be by ours. A republic of women in science, would be to me as extraordinary and uncha∣racteristic in private life, as in the state: All I wish is, that the daughters of the land (on whom much depends) might enjoy similar privileges with the sons; for though it is not given them to rise so high in the scale of be∣ings as the lords of the creation, that transmit their names to posterity, yet as virtuous acts will confer more real honor than a <HI>name,</HI> why should they be denied it? Candour must allow,
<PB N="10" REF="024450_0013_0FC74DEB0F9A5AB0"/>
that God nor nature has not excluded women from being ornaments to their families, however some have chused to treat us <HI>even</HI> below rationality. Lord <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> for one, has been very illiberal to us in several of his letters, wherein he treats us, "as tri∣fling children, capable of nothing but wrangling and quarrelling▪ weak crea∣tures, that are bloated up with self-conceit, and fostered up by vanity:" For he further adds, "women have an intolerable share of it; no flattery, no adulation is too <HI>gross</HI> for them." We are not obliged to this great mas∣ter of politeness, for his sarcastical ob∣servations, on the weak endowments and very narrow faculties of female minds. Had his lordship humanely considered, that it was to a woman he owed his birth, filial reverence might have induced him to have drawn a veil over female imbecillity, especially
<PB N="11" REF="024450_0014_0FC74DEDC3D32428"/>
as it is allowed, by very competent judges, that a tenderness and respect for the fair-sex is a criterion of nati∣onal politeness, and refinement of man∣ners: But I hope the virtues of women, in all ages, have, in general, been <HI>such,</HI> that the bare mention of them will suf∣ciently refute so cruel an assertion.</P>
<P>With due submission to Lord <HI>Ches∣terfield's</HI> humiliating observations, per∣mit me to say, that no man but one, who was governed by a contracted spirit, and more studious to display <HI>wit</HI> than <HI>wisdom,</HI> could have been thus severe upon our whole sex. It must indeed be allowed, that the present mode of education lies too much in ex∣ternal qualifications, which, like an er∣ror in the first concoction, spreads its pernicious influence over our whole lives. The faculties of the mind are not properly exercised; and whilst genius is employed in childish amuse∣ments,
<PB N="12" REF="024450_0015_0FC74DEF3377C030"/>
it is impossible to say how much the soul is curbed in her most noble productions, and useful actions, in which the female powers are not taught to expand. I am certain, numbers of us are more obliged to nature and ap∣plication for instruction, in many parts of laudable improvement, than to all we learn at school. I speak from ex∣perience: We are forced to struggle for the little knowledge we attain, as a swathed infant does for liberty, that is pinioned down, body and limbs, by an injudicious <HI>nurse.</HI> This being my case among many others, I must abso∣lutely disclaim the courage you attri∣bute to me, i. e. "that I have taken learning by force." 'Tis true, I have capitulated a little for it; but the <HI>fort</HI> is so strongly defended by your able <HI>corps,</HI> that, 'tis evident to demonstrati∣on, it will not, in any respect, yield to my weak, presumptuous attack.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="024450_0016_0FC74DFAB8DF6320"/>
But, however, I can still amuse my∣self in an humble sphere, with contem∣plating the mental perfections, and ex∣emplary conduct of those ladies, in ancient and modern times, whose names will reflect honor to our sex. Your encomiums on several, CANDI∣DUS, has flattered and soothed my pride, and turned my thoughts to what history relates of some other noble women, in whom many distinguished graces and virtues were united. But these endowments must be the subject of another letter, in which I intend to introduce so many learned and no∣ble ladies to your notice, that good manners demand your being apprised of their visit. In the mean time I ex∣pect an epistle from you, which will be esteemed a fresh obligation to</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR last epistle to me is a full demonstration, that spleen have never spread her sable wings over you, in respect to your opinion of female literature. You do me justice in as∣serting, that you don't think my am∣bition leads me to leap over those boundaries, that God and nature have seemed to draw between the sexes, merely to be deemed a <HI>learned woman.</HI> Far, very far from it, I assure you, my friend; that abused <HI>epithet,</HI> I am very certain, is not the criterion of female merit. Prudence, Oeconomy, and an obliging deportment in the domestic sphere, I well know, render us far more pleasing and useful in the private walks of life, than mere learning can do, without the former attainments.
<PB N="15" REF="024450_0018_0FC74DFF44248C00"/>
There must be, as you observe, a kind of <HI>sex</HI> in the mind, that dictates its proper employment. I know your sentiments are, on this subject, corres∣pondent with our admired author's, that says, "that a <HI>Boadicea</HI> in armor, and an <HI>Achilles</HI> in petticoats, are ap∣pearances equally ridiculous and extra∣vagant." It may be so; but that ob∣servation does not depreciate the utili∣ty and merits of learned women: Not that I am an advocate for the charac∣ter of those <HI>only</HI> that have been, e∣steemed <HI>learned,</HI> but for all others that have been, and are, exemplary in the virtues of chastity, probity, fideli∣ty, charity, fortitude, and piety; and to approve these virtues are not whol∣ly of the masculine gender, such num∣bers under each class might be addu∣ced, as would compel an infidel to own <HI>that</HI> merit in our sex, many of your's deny.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="024450_0019_0FC74E0284BF8BB0"/>
I will not pretend to enumerate those particular endowments or ac∣complishments, that have immortaliz∣ed the names of some <HI>women,</HI> because it may be thought holding out the gauntlet of challenge to some <HI>men;</HI> besides, the glorious list would swell my letter to a book: Therefore, I shall only beg leave to introduce a few cha∣racters to your notice, in support of female attainments.</P>
<P>I believe our ancestors held learned women in high esteem, and thought, that all excellence had a right to be recorded, since historians have trans∣mitted to us many characters that was eminent in this respect: Witness <HI>Cor∣nelia</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in the lives of <HI>Tiberius</HI> and <HI>Caius,</HI> and in his morals on conjugal precepts. This <HI>Cornelia</HI> was the daughter of <HI>Scipio,</HI> and the wife of <HI>Sempronius Gracchus.</HI></NOTE>, (the mother of the Gracchi)
<PB N="17" REF="024450_0020_0FC74E066C4CC260"/>
she composed such excellent epistles, that her children afterwards derived from them all their eloquence, and <HI>Cicero</HI> himself admired them.</P>

<L>Her rich endowments cou'd great SCIPIO grace,</L>

It is said, <HI>Socrates</HI> himself was pleased to attend her lec∣tures. The Marchioness <HI>du Lambert</HI> wrote excellent advice to her son; and Madame <HI>Savigne's</HI> letters to her daughter, are demonstrations not only of parental affection, but female capa∣city
<PB N="18" REF="024450_0021_0FC74E0E7478A5D0"/>
These latter are believed to be written without study, or any intention to be published: Yet the composition has been thought to surpass <HI>Pliny's,</HI> and many other celebrated authors.—History likewise informs us, that <HI>"Tullia</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Conyers Middleton's</HI> History of <HI>Cicero,</HI> Vol. II.

You, CANDIDUS, that have so tho∣rough a knowledge of the Oriental languages, and ancient history, could, if you please, produce many more in∣stances of great and learned women, than my little reading can furnish me with. But if you will not do our sex that honor, allow me the pleasure to recite some English ladies names, whose minds were irradiated with those bright beams of knowledge, which shone with a lustre almost as strong, as those more renowned ones of <HI>Greece, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> When was there an age that produced more learned and good women, than those who live between the years one thousand five hundred, and one thousand six hun∣dred?

Nazianzen,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Nor was her la∣dyship less eminent for her public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> private charities: She gave a scholar∣ship to St. <HI>John's</HI> college in Oxford, and valuable legacies to the poor of <HI>Rumford, Cheshunt,</HI> and <HI>Wooltham;</HI> and, in her life time, she sent four times a year, money secretly, to buy all neces∣sary provision for four hundred per∣sons in the prisons of London, who were, not allowed to know their benefactress.</P>
<P>Nor does it appear to me, that her next sister, Lady <HI>Anna Bacon,</HI> was, in any respect, inferior to Lady <HI>Burleigh,</HI> in mental endowments. Historians have not scrupled to declare, that to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> care, and great abilities of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, her two sons, owed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> want of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as an ingen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us writer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with∣out any injustice to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of o∣ther of these great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>I must confess, it is an uncommon blessing for one another to give birth to four daughters, of such excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> endowments as those good Judies were. The gren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Author of Mature is not always so profuse of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bounties to one family: There we oft-times

see, that if the mental faculties of one person in it shines with resplen∣dent lustre, other branches of the same family are so remarkable dull in their capacities, that one is almost ready to doubt, they derive their existence from the same parents—However, these learned sisters shall not stand singular in my epistle, since I must admit Sir <HI>Thomas Moore's</HI> bright triumvirate of daughters a place next them; But I fancy the literary circle of ladies, in those days, owed much of their attain∣ments in science, to the great encou∣ragement, and generous instruction of the learned gentlemen of their times: Witness Sir <HI>Thomas Mere,</HI> Sir <HI>Anthony Cooke, Erasmus,</HI> and others; whose minds were too enlarged, whol∣ly to estimate their daughters merits by the standard of their pits and cus∣tards; rightly judging, "that in a

country where the <HI>women</HI> are admit∣ted to a familiar and constant share in the active scenes of life, particular care should be taken in their educati∣on, <HI>to cultivate their reason, and form their hearts."</HI></P>
<P>You well know, CANDIDUS, Sir <HI>Thomas Mere's</HI> daughters were deeply learned, and very respectable women; particularly the eldest, Mrs. <HI>Roper,</HI> his favourite, whom her father (great man as he was) acknowledged to be, in some parts of literature, his rival. It founds an incredible generosity of sen∣timent, that the lord high chancellor of England, should condescend to pronounce a <HI>woman</HI> his equal, much more his superior in science, and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time capable of being en∣trusted with his most important secrets. Nor was it only the partiality of a fond father that celebrated the cha∣racter of these learned sisters, but it
<PB N="27" REF="024450_0030_0FC74311F9A7C10"/>
was re-echoed by the trumpet of fame from distant parts of the world; for mental excellence was then the lover's theme, as much as their mistress's glory; which, I suppose, made <HI>Eras∣mus</HI> say, "the scene of human things is changed; the Monks, famed in times past for learning, are become ignorant, and women love books." But <HI>Erasmus</HI> was but one among the wisest sons of that age, who were emu∣lous to give their suffrage in favor of these much admired sisters, as is evi∣dent by an epigram of the celebrated antiquarian poet, <HI>Mr. John Leeland,</HI> Thus translated:
<Q><L>Forbear too much to extol great Rome from hence,</L>

It would be but like holding a can∣dle to the <HI>sun,</HI> were I to expatiate fur∣ther on the superlative merit of these ladies I have mentioned, or those I might add, it being copiously expressed in the memoirs of several eminent writers.

habitation: No, the rehearsal of these masculine abilities, shall be left by me to some future, more capable, and honored biographer: But you must permit me just to put you in mind of the learning that adorned the most ex∣cellent and benign princess that even swayed the British sceptre! You may easily think, by the word <HI>benign,</HI> I mean the good Queen <HI>Mary:</HI> I do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and I appeal to your veracity, if you can tell of any prince, in whom the graces of majesty, goodness, <HI>learning,</HI> gentleness, and justice, shone with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more strong and united lustre?</P>
<P>What lady, so young, ever showed, a greater firmness of understanding, than this good <HI>princess</HI> did, when she piously expostulated with her father (then upon the throne of <HI>Great-Bri∣tain</HI>) with such energy of reason, up∣on the principle of the Protestant re∣ligion? With what dutiful respect did
<PB N="37" REF="024450_0040_0FC74E5CC4E19E58"/>
she address him, as her parent and so∣vereign; yet, at the same time, how nicely and truly did she sift the reasons that were urged to her, for the infal∣libility of the <HI>Pope?</HI> alledging, that if St. <HI>Peter</HI> himself could not maintain that authority which it was evident he could not, when St. <HI>Paul</HI> withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed, how could that supposed in∣fallibility, which had ceased with mi∣racles, be given to their successors, whose bad lives ill agreed with the <HI>a∣postle's</HI> doctrine? It appears from hi∣story, that Queen <HI>Mary</HI> embraced the Christian religion, upon full convicti∣on of its being orthodox; and she con∣cluded the attack made on her by her royal father, by saying, that "she trusted, by the grace of God, that she should spend the rest of her days in it; and that she was so well assured of
<PB N="38" REF="024450_0041_0FC74E6091DB22F0"/>
the truth of our Savour's words, that she was confident the gates of hell should not prevail against it." To which Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> adds, "that she exerted so much proper resolution, and force of argument, that she let the <HI>popish</HI> party see, that she under∣stood her religion as well as loved it."</P>
<P>But in this grand controversy of the church, it doth not appear, that our noble <HI>heroine</HI> discovered the least tinc∣ture of enthusiasm: On the contrary, she had generous ideas of the liberty of human nature, and of the true ends of government: Nor could she think that religion was to be delivered up to the humors of misguided princes whose persuasion made them as cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in imposing on their subjects the dic∣tates of others, as they themselves we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> implicit in submitting to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Though her soul panted for the tran∣quil pleasure of private life, yet she

supported the burden of a <HI>crown,</HI> with the utmost propriety and patience; because it enabled her, in the elevation of a throne, to be the guardian of pro∣perty and liberty to her subjects.—She narrowly inspected the conduct of the superior clergy, before she would honor them with rich church prefer∣ments; and the disposal of them al∣ways gave her great anxiety, that the <HI>benefice</HI> given might redound to the glory of God, by the worth of its <HI>in∣cumbent.</HI> It sorely grieved the righ∣teous soul of this common parent, that some nominal divines contented them∣selves with <HI>non-residence,</HI> and basked in the sunshine of <HI>pluralities,</HI> while many of their indigent brethren, who labored more abundantly in the vine∣yard, (like their suffering <HI>Master</HI>) scarcely knew <HI>where to lay their beads.</HI> The enormous abuse of riches, and neglect of pastoral duty, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

that of the head, but her hands and heart expanded with the dictates of the former, in all that was great, lau∣dable, and exemplary. Nor did the dignity of a regal queen, tempt her to forget the duties of a private woman; for the hand that swayed the <HI>sceptre,</HI> used the <HI>needle:</HI> And such was the influence of the princess, in this re∣spect, that she brought the new fashi∣on of <HI>sewing</HI> into court, and the town followed the worthy example: Nor was she less active and vigilant in state affairs, when the executive part of na∣tional government was vested solely in <HI>her.</HI> To these bright endowments we may add, in all respects, the strict∣est sincerity, and the sublimest height of conjugal affection and duty. <HI>Pens-fret</HI> was not lavish in his panegyric on this princess. in saying,

<P>Well, CANDIDUS, I suppose you think that I have given you a sufficient criterion for the trial of your reputed virtue, <HI>patience,</HI> to peruse my account of learned ladies: If not, it shall be farther exercised by a few more cha∣racters of women, as eminent for cha∣rity, fortitude, and other heroic and amiable endowments, as the former were for their attainments in <HI>science,</HI></P>
<P>And though these are chiefly of great personages, yet, believe me, I could add numbers in a less exalted sphere, whose private memoirs would be worthy your reading, though I shall suppress my inclination of reciting them now.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="024450_0047_0FC74E6DFB35F28"/>
Perhaps Providence, foreseeing how rigorously we are denied those improve∣ments and acquisitions that you enjoy so freely, has endowed our minds with stronger propensities to virtues of a calm, but magnanimous turn, to compensate, in some degree, the ar∣duous trials that fall to the lot of some women, particularly those who are linked in wedlock, with men of a ty∣rannical, weak, impetuous, or churlish temper. I never read the anecdote of Queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> interceding (with King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, her husband) for the lives of the fix noble burghers of Calais, that my heart does not di∣late with the most sensible pleasure. What cogent reasoning,—what resist∣less eloquence,—what royal dignity,—what tender, yet nervous expostulati∣ons, enforced the petition of this gra∣cious queen, for those unhappy priso∣ners! <HI>Shakespeare</HI> himself could not
<PB N="45" REF="024450_0048_0FC74E7907C4AFB0"/>
have made her talk in a strain more judicious, or suitable to her request: Nor the renowned <HI>Cicero,</HI> at the <HI>bar,</HI> with all his oratory, and the eyes of <HI>Rome</HI> upon him, could not have used greater weight of argument, nor pow∣ers of rhetoric, to gain the cause of his most beloved friend, than this hea∣venly solicitor did, to save the lives of national enemies!—Well might she urge, that the death of these devoted victims would have tarnished the glory of her <HI>Edward's</HI> conquests, and there∣fore she not only pleaded for their lives, but for her <HI>husband's honor, his kingdom, and his crown.</HI> Mercy, uni∣ted with glory, shone round the brows of this royal intercessor, with a far more resplendent lustre, than the spark∣ling rays of the brightest diamond! But <HI>Phillippa</HI> seemed to be the first born daughter of heaven in <HI>mercy;</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="024450_0049_0FC74E7DF7029C70"/>
for I am informed, from <HI>Stow's</HI> survey of London, "that in the reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> there was an erection, or shed, near St. Mary-le-Bow, for the public entertainment of their magesties, and persons of quality, which lasted three days. There it was that Queen <HI>Phillippa▪</HI> with many ladies, fell from the scaffolding, without the least hurt; Wherefore this good queen took great care to save the carpenter from punish∣ment; and through the fervency of her prayer, which she made on her knees, she pacified the king and coun∣cil on this occasion." Well might England exult in such a queen! She, who made the life and happiness of all, her important care, must have reigned triumphant in the heart of e∣very subject! Do you think, CANDI∣DUS, there was ever half the glory in all the victorious battles of her <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI> as there was in the conduct of
<PB N="47" REF="024450_0050_0FC74E86F8541AE0"/>
his royal consort, to preserve the lives of the community? O! <HI>Philippa!</HI> how often has thy eloquence and cle∣mency seemed to vibrate in mine ear, when I have contemplated thy tomb in the universe of death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Westminster-Abbey.</NOTE>! There I thought how liberally this Island had been blest, in having <HI>queens for its nursing mothers,</HI> and interceding friends: For I find, that in 1517, when an insurrection of the London apprentices happened, under pretence of expelling such strangers as carried on trades in London, which being sup∣pressed, two hundred of the rioters were convicted of treason; but one hundred and eighty-five were pardon∣ed, on the powerful intercession of the queens of <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> then residing in the court of <HI>England</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Stow's Survey of London.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="024450_0051_0FC74E88371A52C0"/>
These acts of clemency and good∣ness, speak <HI>women</HI> to be something more than those little impertinent, fri∣volous animals, who are only capable of busying themselves in the trifling concerns of their neighbors, the baga∣telle of a day, or placing a flounce or feather. Noble distinctions and epi∣thets! by which some of the male part of the human creation, are pleased to li∣mit the extent of our talents.—But such men have never learnt to look inward, and improve their rational fa∣culties; a lesson that would instruct them, at the same time, to treat our's with candor, and never to depreciate women for verifying that we have <HI>souls;</HI> which we think it our duty to render worthy the residence of a Deity, and not let our perception and powers of understanding contract, and grow useless for want of due exercise.</P>
<P>In remoter centuries, the trumpet
<PB N="49" REF="024450_0052_0FC74E89B4B78B60"/>
of fame has been loud in celebrating the just praises of those great learned ladies I have mentioned. <HI>Cowley</HI> him∣self, speaking of female attainments, condescended to say of his favorite,
<Q><L><HI>Orinda</HI> does our boasting sex out do,</L>
<L>Not in wit only, but in virtue too:</L>
<L>She does above our best examples rise,</L>
<L>In hate of vice, and scorn of vanities, &amp;c. &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>To these ladies of ancient date, who were adepts in science, and emi∣nent for noble actions, I could (as I said before) recite numbers of great dignity in the present republic of let∣ters, that never made their wealth a shield to sloth; which might contra∣dict the assertion of <HI>Sallust,</HI> "that luxury and idleness suits none but women." But quality having taken the due precedence in this list of great la∣dies, I must not <HI>now</HI> extend it, to give
<PB N="50" REF="024450_0053_0FC74E97DD7E1C20"/>
women of humbler birth, but conge∣nial merit, a place at their feet. Cer∣tain it is, that the heroic virtues, or the distinctions of learning, have not been confined to ladies of high rank, though munificent charities are often limited to them, by the narrow bound∣aries of circumstances. The late ce∣lebrated Mrs.<HI>Rowe</HI> is one among many, whose character is a full de∣monstration of this assertion; for she, in obscure life, and with a mediocrity of fortune, was truly exemplary in exalted beneficence, ascetic piety, and great humility; and to the bright as∣semblage of these, and other virtues, she added those real accomplishments, and knowledge in literature, that a∣dorn high stations. Would the un∣thinking part of women endeavor to imitate such a model of human per∣fection, much money might be saved from being lavished away in superflu∣ous
<PB N="51" REF="024450_0054_0FC74E998D159430"/>
ornament, and much time redeem∣ed from being spent in diversions of doubtful innocence. Mrs.<HI>Rowe's</HI> pri∣vate charities were greater in her sta∣tion, than those public ones of great personages, whose names are recorded in history: That informs us, St <HI>Ca∣tharine's</HI> hospital, near the Tower, had the honor to be founded and endow∣ed by four queens of England. Queen <HI>Matilda</HI> or <HI>Maud,</HI> was the first found∣ress, whose graces of mind and person, we are told, seemed to contend for ri∣valship; yet her supreme humility did not allow her to be conscious of either. Queen <HI>Eleanor,</HI> wife to King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, was next, whose conjugal af∣fection was of such a magnitude, that she saved her husband's life at the greatest hazard of her own. Queen <HI>Philippa</HI> was the third foundress of this noble hospital; the splendor of her virtues I will not enlarge more on
<PB N="52" REF="024450_0055_0FC74E9AF7D4A9E0"/>
than I have already done: Nor shall I expatiate upon those of the fourth queen, <HI>Catharine,</HI> (dowager) I suppose to <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth. To these royal dames, (of ancient times) I might add a long list of noble ladies now living, that petitioned to his late majesty for, and liberally subscribed to, the endow∣ment of the foundling-hospital.</P>
<P>Though my examples of female ge∣nerosity, or arguments for female lite∣rature, are by no means exhausted, I will obtrude but one character more, of the former, to your considerati∣on.—It is that of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> (Margaret) countess of Richmond and Derby, and mother to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh. This lady was greatly distinguished for her piety, though it was strongly tinc∣tured with the superstition of those times. Her charities were very great and extensive: She performed, all her life time, so many noble acts, and
<PB N="53" REF="024450_0056_0FC74EA49A9294F0"/>
charitable deeds, that as <HI>Stow</HI> expres∣ses it, "they cannot be recited in a small volume." I shall mention only three; the two colleges she founded at Cambridge, one to <HI>Christ,</HI> the other to St. <HI>John</HI> his disciple; and the gram∣mar school at <HI>Winbourne:</HI> And she kept constantly in her house twelve poor persons, whom she maintained in every respect; and her high rank<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis said of this illustrious lady that, by her birth and marriage with the Earl of Richmond, she was allied to thirty kings and queens.</NOTE> was so far from inspiring her with pride or haughtiness, that she would frequently dress the wounds of poor distressed people with her own hands.</P>
<P>So much to the memory of the re∣nowned dead! The celebrity of living ladies, I should be happy to see recited by your pen, as I flatter myself they must retain the esteem of the most

<HEAD>TO FULVIA: ON THE TRANQUIL PLEASURE OF RURAL FELICITY.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE left the busy town, and all its tumultuous joys, for several weeks past, to visit some very worthy friends, who live a retired life in the humble vale of <HI>Calmly.</HI> That you have not heard from me since I have been there, is owing to my incapacity of entertaining a <HI>lady</HI> of your gaiety of temper, with volatile news from a village, where amusements seldom rise higher than a mountebank parade, or the rural felicity of a <HI>May-pole.</HI> No doubt but you will rally me for vul∣garity of taste, when I tell you I was a
<PB N="56" REF="024450_0059_0FC74EB04AC3FB40"/>
spectator of these rustic diversions. But don't be severe on me, for you know my veneration for antiquity; and I can plead superiors in rank, who attended the festivities of a May-day, long before your humble servant was in being.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These festivities were formerly attended by persons of distinction.</NOTE> My being accidental∣ly here at this time was a fortunate circumstance, as it gave the inhabi∣tants (of the highest class) an oppor∣tunity to pay their respect to their worthy priest, by inviting his guest to their <HI>May-pole.</HI> I knew the compli∣ment paid me, meant as much respect as a ticket from a duchess to a birth-night ball; and as such I received the simplicity of peasants with grateful sen∣sibility. I excused myself from being near the centre of entertainment, as both my friends at the vicarage were invalids, for which reason I confined
<PB N="57" REF="024450_0060_0FC74EB174B54D28"/>
myself to the limits of their paddock. But though I could not, with proprie∣ty, share the honors of the day, in dan∣cing round the <HI>May-pole,</HI> I was near enough stationed to be happy in seeing much innocent joy diffused over the face of the harmless cottagers, without any luxurious expence. How cheaply may pleasure be procured, where the mind is not tainted with ambition or extravagance! A ploughman's whistle, or a milk maid's song, sometimes con∣veys as much music as those Italian notes, for which you often pay a very high price at the opera. But then they would not have the force of no∣velty, which has a most powerful charm for <HI>Fulvia.</HI></P>
<P>Fine weather, and this gay season of the year, when <HI>nature wantons in her prime,</HI> I suppose, contributed to the chearfulness of this rural assembly.
<PB N="58" REF="024450_0061_0FC74EC244870EC0"/>
However, the delight so apparent in their aspect, communicated itself to my mind; and it was equal, if not su∣perior, to any I ever felt, when I have been a spectator of the proud parade which attends the king when he goes to the parliament house, or the glare and festivity that accompanies a lord mayor's show. These pageants of a day wear off the mind with the exhi∣bitions of it, or else leave it to reflect on the caprices of fortune: For you know, the followers of these triumphal appearances are often divided into parties of <HI>huzzaers,</HI> or <HI>hissers,</HI> with∣out knowing (perhaps) for why, or what; but as one leads the other, they form a clamor, which majesty it∣self cannot silence.
<Q>"What king so strong, can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?"</Q></P>
<P>That monarch never can, who is
<PB N="59" REF="024450_0062_0FC74EC716DD60D8"/>
giddy with unbridled power, and thirst of unlimited sway; who does not use his prerogative of human greatness for the good of his subjects, and depend∣ents, whether in church or state, and bounds his ambition by this reason.</P>
<P>But I must not moralize with you, <HI>Fulvia,</HI> who, I am sure, will not envy me the rustic enjoyment of plebeian sports, whilst you can range unrival∣led in Kensington gardens, and the park; and, at other times, display yourself in all the pride of beauty, glittering with jewels in a side-box, the masquerade, or Ranelagh, with all your surrounding beau attendants: These inflate your mind with empty adulation, and make you think you are something above the human spe∣cies, and incapable of change, pain, or the innovations of age and disease. Alas! what is there our weak sex will not believe, when we are compli∣mented
<PB N="60" REF="024450_0063_0FC74EC818D7F858"/>
with the attributes of a deity? Pleasure we still pursue in every delu∣sive form, though when it has run its wild career, it generally leaves us near the same ground on which it first found us; seldom on better.</P>
<P>But these, you will tell me, "are cold, phlegmatic sentiments, to which you will not attempt to lower your i∣deas: They can only be adopted by some country parson's wife, or forsa∣ken old maid, who never breathed the fragrant air of St. James's, and can have no perception of the glorious con∣quest of subduing hearts.</P>
<LG>
<L>" In that gay circle thousand <HI>Cupid's</HI> rove,</L>
<L>" The court of Britain is the court of love."</L>
</LG>
<P>Rustic souls in the country may dul∣ly attend their dinner and prayers, or be pleased with the stupid amusement of books and work, but such frozen hearts can have no more adequate idea
<PB N="61" REF="024450_0064_0FC74EC973E297C0"/>
of the homage paid to beauty, than the deaf can be a judge of harmony, the blind of symmetry, or the prude of politeness." Such being the lan∣guage of your heart, I am afraid I should have but ill success, were I to invite you to leave the <HI>beau-monde</HI> party, (who are daily offering up the incense of flattery to your greedy va∣nity) and, for variety's sake, wish you to try what the country will afford: A different entertainment I'll assure you, as you have never been out of the smoke of London, I will try to give you a specimen of what delights me here.</P>
<P>My reverend friend, in whose hos∣pitable mansion I now am, performs all the duties of his function, with great regularity and exemplary piety. He has long since renounced popular applause, for the solid satisfactions of
<PB N="62" REF="024450_0065_0FC74ED846865D48"/>
duty. His congregation highly reve∣rence him in the pulpit, and love and esteem him out of it. With gentle remonstrance he silences any little dis∣putes that may arise amongst his pa∣rishioners, and nips contention in the bud, betwixt dissenting parties. In many of the exigencies that occur in life, this worthy man has shewn him∣self the <HI>lawyer</HI> as well as the <HI>divine:</HI> and has been thought the former in courts of judicature, where he has pleaded the cause of the widow and orphan with resistless energy, without fee or reward, <HI>when he saw his help in the gate.</HI></P>
<P>I often enjoy the luxury of mental food, when I go by invitation) to my friend's library, not <HI>with remnants of Latin to puzzle the vicar,</HI> but with questions relative to opinions, books, or authors. These my preceptor im∣mediately condescends to answer, and
<PB N="63" REF="024450_0066_0FC74ED9F3FEFD48"/>
conveys instruction to his female pupil, without ostentation of learning, or se∣verity of reproof. Most generously my friend points our some latent flaw in my conduct or sentiments, that was before unknown to myself; and by some amicable opposition in argument, rectifies my judgment, by politely ma∣king me sensible of my errors. The stream of conversation is generally turned into some improving or plea∣sing channel, without degenerating in∣to tittle-tattle, or dwelling on the faults of the absent; the errors of whom, this society think it prudent to forget, and seldom allow themselves to make a comment on it. In other company, I have often observed with concern, scandal gives a zest to con∣versation, and if one cannot dwell on that topic in modern visits, or enlarge on fashions, &amp;c. &amp;c. a ragout is want∣ing to compleat the table. As I can∣not
<PB N="64" REF="024450_0067_0FC74EE284F12EB8"/>
always partake of this feast to o∣thers with innocence to myself, nor stem its tide by reserve, I have often turned from it, and combated your railery on the occasion, with silent smiles, but not of approbation. To accept of an invitation to an enter∣tainment reason condemns, is to me like being duped by that enchantress, whose bed was covered with fine linen, and strewed with roses, but thorns were planted in the pillow of reflecti∣on.</P>
<P>But here it is far otherwise, the wan∣ton never invited the libertine to come in and smell of her myrrh, cinnamon, &amp;c. &amp;c. with half the propriety that I again solicit you to come and regale your mental faculties, in this society at <HI>Calmly.</HI>—Believe me, <HI>Fulvia,</HI> it would strengthen your reason, and give a lasting polish (tho' not a modern one) to your manners.

<P>But I suppose you would think such a retirement like the valley and shadow of death, and enter into it with as much disgust and solemnity, as you would the convent of the Car∣melites: But don't be afraid; I assure my gay friend, this mansion itself wears a chearful aspect; and the minds of the inhabitants are illumi∣nated by that light, which is not hid to the world, but of manifest advan∣tage to society. I am no favorer of monastic solitude, nor constrained de∣votion. "Religion does not send her true votaries to cloisters, to add
<PB N="67" REF="024450_0070_0FC74A2ADDC73AE0"/>
one crime to another, by retreat into a useless, and too often a discontented life; where uniform and chearful pi∣ety cannot shew its light to the world, nor encourage others to tread the same footsteps by example."</P>
<P><HI>Constantia,</HI> the vicar's wife, has re∣fined sense, and a judicious taste, in most parts of ancient and modern li∣terature, being mistress of the French tongue, and not ignorant of the Italian. Her husband often appeals to her judg∣ment, in points of criticism, to strength∣en his own: Yet, with all the advan∣tage of a scholar in abstruse science, the modest <HI>Constantia</HI> is as humble as either of her maids; and as fearful of displaying her superior knowledge that way, as if she was to be fined for the acquisition. She well knows every branch of domestic oeconomy, and there she constantly shines with pecu∣liar grace and dignity. Calm, steady
<PB N="68" REF="024450_0071_0FC74A34EF498B88"/>
wisdom, seems to direct every part of the compass in her line of duty, and all is prudently executed, without hur∣ry or confusion.</P>
<P>The world, in general, have a very illiberal opinion of the conduct and manners of women, who are deemed <HI>learned,</HI> an epithet of frightful import! With it, we are looked on, by our own sex, as owls among the lesser birds; and, by the lords of the creation, as having a superficial, pragmatical know∣ledge. But surely this is an error in judgment; for learning, properly u∣sed, renders our sex much more suit∣able companions to men of sense and literature, as well as better qualified to instruct their children, and save some expence in their education. That man must have a very contracted soul, who is jealous of prerogative, be∣cause his wife happens to know some∣thing beyond the government of her
<PB N="69" REF="024450_0072_0FC74A360B767A90"/>
table. No such narrow minded jea∣lousy reigns in the breast of this wor∣thy <HI>divine.</HI> His and his <HI>Constantia's</HI> conduct to each other, gives me the highest opinion of the marriage state, in which this couple has lived above forty years, mutual, comforts to each other; and still their happiness seems increasing: For the God-like luxury of promoting each other's felicity, and doing good to society, is a bliss of that nature, that age cannot alter, nor cus∣tom cloy.</P>
<P><HI>Montaigne</HI> said justly, "that all external acquisitions receive colour and taste from the internal constituti∣on." Thus the order of this house, the neatness of the garden, which con∣tains every wholesome vegetable and pleasing flower, is an emblem of the order and tranquility of the owner's minds, were religious and social vir∣tues
<PB N="70" REF="024450_0073_0FC74A379CA413B8"/>

<HEAD>ON MARRIAGE; ADDRESSED TO A SISTER.</HEAD>
<P>To be a wife, Maria, such as I could wish you, requires more care, more temper, more conduct and solidity, than young women usually pretend to; therefore, to become a wife, it were necessary to become a new woman, in the most essential parts of her conduct. The very great dif∣ference between the obsequiousness of a lover, and the authority of a husband, will set this in a proper light. To the mo∣ment of your marriage it is your reign; your lover is proud to oblige you, watches your smiles, is obedient to your commands, anxious to please you, and careful to avoid every thing you disap∣prove; but you have no sooner pro∣nounced that harsh word <HI>obey,</HI> than
<PB N="83" REF="024450_0086_0FC74A74FAA84410"/>
you give up the reins, and it is his turn to rule so long as you live. Then it is that he, very justly expects an ad∣equate return. He has served you with fidelity; and the laws of nature, the bonds of society, and the injuncti∣ons of religion, now claim your grate∣ful obedience—not to the mandates of a tyrant, but your chearful submission, and pleasing compliance to the soft dictates of a friend, a guardian, and protector. Yet this is so opposite to the vain pleasure of a rule, and so dif∣ficult to be relished at the first, that many young girls, soon after their mar∣riage, think themselves ill treated if they are ever so gently contradicted, and seem, by their perverse manner, to think eternal adoration their parti∣cular due, and that their husbands ought to kneel like their lovers, and fawn like their lap dogs, to their lives end. This, however, so far from set∣ting
<PB N="84" REF="024450_0087_0FC74A775538E068"/>
them in an advantageous point of view, or making them objects of envy or imitation, would only render the husband contemptible, the wife despi∣cable. A quite contrary mode of be∣haviour is absolutely necessary in every woman, who is ambitious of honor, or barely desirous of respect.</P>
<P>The moment a woman enters into the nuptial state, she should look up∣on herself as a new being, or rather as being in a new kind of existence. She ought to look upon the trifles which before delighted her, with the same eyes as a man views the baubles of his infancy. The pleasing levities, and agreeable fooleries of a girl, are particularly disgusting in a wife, and very often receive a construction not at all redounding to her understand∣ing or her modesty. The honor of a woman, and that of a soldier, is justly said to be equally delicate, it must not
<PB N="85" REF="024450_0088_0FC74A78B9286E58"/>
be trifled with; but the reputation of a wife exceeds both; it must not be injured, even in thought. Hence you may perceive, of what importance it is for a married woman, to attend to seeming trifles, both on account of the unfavorable impressions her husband may receive on her neglect, and what constructions a busy world may put on it. It is necessary for her to relin∣quish, in a great measure, her young female acquaintance; at least, to be careful of going abroad with parties of them, except in the company of her husband; for you seldom know a knot of young females without their attendant beaux, whose politeness can∣not refuse compliments to a lady mere∣ly because she may be married; and these compliments may sometimes be impertinent, often misconstrued, and are generally improper for the ear of
<PB N="86" REF="024450_0089_0FC74A8493A39298"/>
a married woman. But the relin∣quishing of all male acquaintance is an indispensible point, where reputation is regarded, and intended to be pre∣served. Innocent freedoms between the youthful of both sexes may be in∣dulged, before matrimony, without the censure even of the most rigid cy∣nic; but after that, they become cri∣minal in the eye of the world, and can∣not be suffered without a manifest inju∣ry to the character of a virtuous wo∣man.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE TENDERNESS AND FORTITUDE OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH delicacy and ten∣derness be the most amiable ornaments of the female character, and are those properties which more immediately insure our veneration, and command our love; yet is not fortitude in the hour of trial, nor foresight in that of danger, to be ex∣empted from their other virtues.</P>
<P>The devotion of women towards the objects of their duty and affection, has been carried, in many cases, to such extremes of sensibility, that the weakness of their natures has been forgotten in the day of trouble, and when the body would have sunk had it not been supported by the vigor of the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="024450_0091_0FC74A87C2E6D410"/>
How often have these amiable exam∣amples of parential affection and con∣nubial love hung over the bed of sick∣ness, for weary days and sleepless nights, without the sigh of impatience, or the murmer of complaint! The victims of sentiment, and absorbed by duty, how frequently do they testify their attach∣ment, although, perhaps, to an unfeel∣ing and ungrateful object, when their reward, alas! happens to be insulting language, and a breaking heart! How distressing is it to see them steal aside to wipe away, in private, those tears, which, if publicly encouraged to flow, would strike with contrition and shame the unworthy partaker of their cares! Tender to excess, when tenderness is a duty, and undaunted to the extreme, when courage becomes a virtue; we see them collected in danger, patient of cold, of hunger, and fatigue; con∣tent to share the stony pillow or the
<PB N="89" REF="024450_0092_0FC74A8E86920990"/>
noisome draught—to despise the how∣ling wind, the beating rain, or the lathing surge—provided only they can soften misery, and prove their love.</P>
<P>In those trying and eventful mo∣ments of life, when the balanced mind requires a counsellor to fix its resolu∣tion, and a friend to point out, and to shew by example, the necessity of for∣titude; how often have women exhi∣bited, upon those occasions, instances of courage the most heroical, of resig∣nation the most philosophical, and of a contempt of death, to be admired, at least, if not imitated! and of this position we have many vouchers in the annals of ancient history, as well as in the occurrences of our own.</P>
<P>The life and death of Portia, one of the most illustrious, as well as one of the most virtuous and accomplished of the Roman matrons, affords a ve∣ry prominent, and, if I may be allow∣ed
<PB N="90" REF="024450_0093_0FC74A900BB00120"/>
the expression, a very striking ex∣ample of the intrepid despondency of a female kind, which shares in, and is determined to partake of the misfor∣tunes of disappointed and heroic love. The daughter of Cato, the most re∣nowned of the senators of Rome, for austerities of manners and integrity of heart; she seemed to have derived from the paternal source the dignity of a more than female deportment in life, and of a more than manly forti∣tude in death: and the means that she employed to rid herself of a painful existence were unprecedented for their application and effect. So soon as she heard of the overthrow and fate of her beloved Brutus, she swallowed the burning coal; as if the excess of her virtue could only be measured by the extremity of her suffering.</P>
<P>There are but few characters in hi∣story that excite the feelings of the
<PB N="91" REF="024450_0094_0FC74A95F073B790"/>
reader so much as the unhappy fortune of Agrippina, the illustrious widow of the great Germanicus. A peculiar tenderness of sentiment is always found to accompany her name; and the eye seems to droop with compassi∣on, and the soul to melt with pity, whenever this virtuous and amiable mourner is brought to remembrance, and bears with a feeble step and a de∣jected look, the urn that contains the ashes of her lamented husband: a sub∣ject that has always been a particular favourite with the lovers of painting, and which will ever strike and interest the mind of sensibility, so long as the pen can immortalize, or the pencil charm.</P>
<P>The fortitude of Arria has been re∣corded on marble, and adds, not in∣deed an amiable example, but a stub∣born proof, of the undaunted vigor of the female mind.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="024450_0095_0FC74A9C513749A0"/>
Paetus, the husband of Arria, was a favorite of Nero, and to whom he confided a secret of importance, with a strict injunction that he should not communicate to any person whatever, the nature of its contents; but so sin∣gular an affection did he bear to his wife, that he could not help committing to her breast the particulars with which he was instructed; but he soon had occasion to repent of his indiscre∣tion, and her life, as well as his own, became the victim of her imprudence and breach of trust.</P>
<P>While the one was lamenting in prison the abuse of confidence, and the weakness of love, and in moment∣ary expectation of an ignominious and a painful death, the other found an opportunity to introduce herself into his presence, and with a dagger, which she had hitherto concealed, she inflict∣ed in her breast a deadly wound, and
<PB N="93" REF="024450_0096_0FC74AA132D5CF28"/>
then drawing out the fatal instrument, she presented the point to her hus∣band, and accompanied it with these memorable words: "The point to me is soft, but the wound that it will occasion thee is truly painful"</P>
<P>This kind of fortitude, resulting from despair, is unamiable, if not dis∣gusting in itself, and partakes more of ferocity, than of that patient firmness, and affecting resolution, of which ma∣ny bright examples may be given in the English history.</P>
<P>When Prince Edward was wounded by a poison'd arrow from the hand of a Saracen, in the time of the crusades, his wife, the beauteous Eleanor, with signal love and pious hazard, applied her balmy lips to attract the venom it had left; an instance of affection and fortitude without a rival, and which danger could be only justified by the
<PB N="94" REF="024450_0097_0FC74AA2028ED8A0"/>
transcendant merit of the object for whom it was incurred.</P>
<P>The conduct of Margaret of Anjou, after the defeat of the Sixth Henry at the battle of Hexham, presents a no∣ble instance of female heroism; as the field of combat was at too great a dis∣tance from the Scottish territories to permit the Lancastrians to retreat with safety, and as the country abounded with mountains and woods, they were not only annoyed, but frequently cap∣tured by the enemy. The Queen, in her flight with the prince, betrayed by the splendor of dress, was surrounded and taken by a party of banditti; but while they were disputing about the spoil, she made an escape, and had not proceeded far before she was again met by a single robber; when, collecting all her fortitude, she advanced towards him, saying, "Here, friend, protect thy prince." The man, struck with
<PB N="95" REF="024450_0098_0FC74AA4DBE4EA38"/>
awe, instantly obeyed the mandate, and conducted his royal charge to a village adjoinining to the sea, from which they passed into the dominions of the Duke of Burgundy in Holland.</P>
<P>Many other instances of tenderness and fortitude, produced by instinctive or acquired love, might be adduced to the honor of the female character, in the exalted situations of life: and even in the more humble and neglected ha∣bits of society, the affection and at∣tachment of women, although sur∣rounded by distress and misery, have not been without the excitements of applause and imatation; for virtue is often concealed by rags, and greatness of soul confined by want of action.</P>
<P>Do we not frequently observe these amiable ornaments of human nature, these refiners of our pleasures and a∣menders of our hearts, whose tender∣ness softens the rigor, and whose for∣titude
<PB N="96" REF="024450_0099_0FC74AA5D5E10B30"/>
instructs us to bear the rebuffs of life;—do we not frequently see these angelic consolers watch over, with care and perseverence, the bodily suffering; and endeavor, by the elo∣quence of tears, and the energy of words, to divert the merited afflic∣tions of a worthless husband, a cruel parent, or a profligated and ungrateful son!</P>
<P>However painful the knowledge of infidelity and the abuse of tenderness may be, yet is there an unspeakable comfort to be derived from the wil∣ling performance of moral duties, be the objects of them ever so undeserving of regard: and he who can affix a ge∣neral censure of inhumanity, or want of sentiment, upon that sex, from whom our principal comforts in life are derived, ought to live forever ex∣empted from those delights, which a rational intercourse of thought, and a
<PB N="97" REF="024450_0100_0FC74AA736078EE8"/>
confidence of mind, in an union of love and virtue, can only produce, substantiate, and ensure.</P>

<HEAD>ON CONVERSATION: FROM MISS MORE'S ESSAYS.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been advised, and by very re∣spectable authorities too, that in conversation, women should carefully conceal any knowledge or learning they may happen to possess. I own with submission, that I do not see ei∣ther the necessity or propriety of this advice. For if a young lady has that discretion and modesty, without which all knowledge is little worth, she will never make an ostentatious parade of it, because she will rather be intent on acquiring more, than on displaying what she has.</P>
<P>I am at a loss to know why a young female is instructed to exhibit, in the most advantageous point of view, her
<PB N="99" REF="024450_0102_0FC74AB57B023F38"/>
skill in music, her singing, dancing, taste in dress, and her acquaintance with the most fashionable games and amusements, while her piety is to be anxiously concealed, and her know∣ledge affectedly disavowed, lest the for∣mer should draw on her the appella∣tion of an enthusiast, or the latter that of a pedant.</P>
<P>In regard to knowledge, why should she for ever affect to be on her guard, lest she should be found guilty of a small portion of it? She need be the less solicitous about it, as it seldom proves to be so very considerable as to excite astonishment or admiration: for, after all the acquisitions which her talents and her studies have ena∣bled her to make, she will, generally speaking, be found to have less of what is called <HI>learning,</HI> than a common school boy.</P>
<P>It would be to the last degree pre∣sumptuous
<PB N="100" REF="024450_0103_0FC74AB70F23ABE0"/>
and absurd, for a young woman to pretend to give the <HI>ton</HI> to the company—to interrupt the plea∣sure of others, and her own opportu∣nity of improvement, by talking when she ought to listen—or to introduce subjects out of the common road, in order to show her own wit, or to expose the want of it in others: but were the sex to be totally silent when any topic of literature happens to be discussed in their presence, conversati∣on would lose much of its vivacity, and society would be robbed of one of its most interesting charms.</P>
<P>How easily and effectually may a well-bred woman promote the most useful and elegant conversation, almost without speaking a word! for the modes of speech are scarcely more va∣riable than the modes of silence. The silence of listless ignorance, and the si∣lence of the sparkling intelligence, are
<PB N="101" REF="024450_0104_0FC74AC51970C970"/>
perhaps as separately marked, and as distinctly expressed, as the same feel∣ings could have been by the most un∣equivocal language. A woman, in a company where she has the least in∣fluence, may promote any subject by a profound and invariable attention, which shows that she is pleased with it, and by an illuminated countenance, which proves she understands it. This obliging attention is the most flat∣tering encouragement in the world to men of sense and letters, to continue any topic of instruction or entertain∣ment they happen to be engaged in: it owed its introduction perhaps to ac∣cident, the best introduction in the world for a subject of ingenuity, which, though it could not have been for∣mally proposed without pedantry, may be continued with ease and good hu∣mor; but which will be frequently and effectually stopped by the listlessness

inattention, or whispering of silly girls, whose weariness betrays their igno∣rance, and whose impatience exposes their ill-breeding. A polite man, however deeply interested in the sub∣ject on which he is conversing, catches at the slightest hint to have done: a look is a sufficient intimation, and if a pretty simpleton, who sits near him, seems <HI>distraite,</HI> he puts an end to his remarks, to the great regret of the rea∣sonable part of the company, who per∣haps might have gained more improve∣ment by the continuance of such a con∣versation, than a week's reading would have yielded them: for it is such com∣pany as this, that give an edge to each other's wit, "as iron sharpeneth iron."</P>
<P>That silence is one of the great arts of conversation is allowed by Cicero himself, who says, there is not only an art, but even an eloquence in it. And this opinion is confirmed by a great

modern<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon.</NOTE> in the following little anec∣dote from one of the ancients:</P>
<P>When many Grecian philosophers had a solemn meeting before the am∣bassador of a foreign prince, each en∣deavored to show his parts by the bril∣liancy of his conversation, that the ambassador might have something to relate of the Grecian wisdom. One of them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity of his companions, observed a profound silence; when the ambas∣sador, turning to him, asked, <Q>But what have you to say, that I may re∣port it?</Q> He made this laconic, but very pointed reply: <Q>Tell your king that you have found one a∣mong the Greeks who knew how to be silent.</Q></P>
<P>There is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than
<PB N="104" REF="024450_0107_0FC74AC9B9160380"/>
knowledge, this is wit, the most capti∣vating, but the most dreaded of all ta∣lents: the most dangerous to those who have it, and the most feared by those who have it not. Though it is against all the rules, yet I cannot find in my heart to abuse this charming quality. He who is grown rich with∣out it, in safe and sober dulness, shuns it as a disease, and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomitant. The moralist disclaims against it, as the source of irregularity; and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankrupt∣cy itself; for he considers it as the pa∣rent of extravagance and beggary. The cynic will ask of what use it is! Of very little perhaps: no more is a flower garden, and yet it is allowed as an object of innocent amusement and delightful recreation, A woman who possesses this quality, has received a most dangerous present, perhaps not
<PB N="105" REF="024450_0108_0FC74ACB373C6568"/>
less so than beauty itself: especially if it be not sheathed in a temper peculi∣arly inoffensive, chastised by a most correct judgment, and restrained by more prudence than falls to the com∣mon lot.</P>
<P>This talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for as wit is the immediate property of its possessor, and learning is only an ac∣quaintance with the knowledge of other people, there is much more dan∣ger, that we should be vain of what is our own, than of what we borrow.</P>
<P>But wit, like learning, is not near so common a thing as is imagined. Let not, therefore, a young lady be alarmed at the acuteness of her own wit, any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge. The great danger is, lest she should mistake pert∣ness, flippancy, or imprudence, for
<PB N="106" REF="024450_0109_0FC74ACEF88B24B8"/>
this brilliant quality, or imagine she is witty, only because she is indiscreet. This is very frequently the case; and this makes the name of wit so cheap, while its real existence is so rare.</P>
<P>Lest the flattery of her acquaintance, or an overweening opinion of her own qualifications, should lead some vain and petulant girl into a false notion that she has a great deal of wit, when she has only a redundancy of animal spirits, she may not find it useless to attend to the definition of this quality, by one who had as large a portion of it, as most individuals could ever boast:
<Q><LG>
<L>'Tis not a tale, 'tis not a jest,</L>
<L>Admir'd with laughter at a feast,</L>
<L>Nor florid talk, which can that title gain,</L>
<L>The proofs of wit forever must remain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Neither can that have any place,</L>
<L>At which a virgin hides her face;</L>
<L>Such dross the fire must purge away; tis' just</L>
<L>The author blush there, where the reader must.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="024450_0110_0FC74AD07B3CE2F0"/>
But those who actually possess this rare talent, cannot be too abstinent in the use of it. It often makes admi∣rers, but it never makes friends; I mean, where it is the predominant fea∣ture; and the unprotected and de∣fenceless state of womanhood calls for friendship more than for admiration. She who does not desire friends, has a sordid and insensible soul; but she who is ambitious of making every man her admirer, has an invincible vanity, and a cold heart.</P>
<P>But to dwell only on the side of po∣licy; a prudent woman, who has esta∣blished the reputation of some genius, will sufficiently maintain it, without keeping her faculties always on the stretch to say <HI>good things.</HI> Nay, if re∣putation alone be her object, she will gain a more solid one by her forbear∣ance; as the wiser part of her acquain∣tance will ascribe it to the right mo∣tive
<PB N="108" REF="024450_0111_0FC74ADC40B601C0"/>
which is, not that she has less wit, but that she has more judgment.</P>
<P>The fatal fondness for indulging a spirit of ridicule, and the injurious and irreparable consequences which some∣times attend the <HI>too prompt reply,</HI> can never be too seriously or too severely condemned. Not to offend is the first step towards pleasing. To give pain is as much an offence against humani∣ty, as against good breeding; and surely it is as well to abstain from an action because it is sinful, as because it is unpolite. In company, young la∣dies would do well, before they speak, to reflect, if what they are going to say, may not distress some worthy persons present, by wounding them in their persons, families, connexions, or reli∣gious opinions. If they find it will touch them in either of these, I would advise them to suspect, that what they are going to say, is not so <HI>very</HI> good
<PB N="109" REF="024450_0112_0FC74ADE0212DA70"/>
a thing as they at first imagined. Nay, if even it was one of those bright ideas, which <HI>Venus has imbued with a fifth part of her nectar,</HI> so much greater will be their merit in suppressing it, if there was a probability it might of∣fend. Indeed if they have the temper and prudence to make such a previous reflection, they will be more richly rewarded by their own inward tri∣umph, at having suppressed a lively but severe remark, than they could have been with the dissembled ap∣plauses of the whole company, who, with that complaisant deceit, which good breeding too much authorises, affect openly to admire what they se∣cretly resolve never to forgive.</P>
<P>I have always been delighted with the story of the little girl's eloquence, in one of the children's tales, who re∣ceived from a friendly fairy, the gift
<PB N="110" REF="024450_0113_0FC74ADF847C3950"/>
that at every word she uttered, pinks, roses, diamonds, and pearls, should drop from her mouth. The hidden moral appears to be this, that it was the sweetness of her temper which produced this pretty fanciful effect; for when her malicious sister desired the same gift from the good natured tiny intelligence, the venom of her own heart converted it into poisonous and loathsome reptiles.</P>
<P>A man of sense and breeding will sometimes join in the laugh, which has been raised at his expense, by an ill∣natured repartee: but it was very cut∣ting, and one of that shocking sort of truths, which, as they can scarcely be pardoned even in private, ought ne-never to be uttered in public, he does not laugh because he is pleased, but because he wishes to conceal how much he is hurt. As the sarcasm was uttered by a lady, so far from
<PB N="111" REF="024450_0114_0FC74AE5562ADDA0"/>
seeming to resent it, he will be the first to commend it; but notwith∣standing that, he will remember it as a trait of malace, when the whole com∣pany shall have forgotten it as a stroke of wit. Women are so far from be∣ing priviledged by their sex to say un∣handsome or cruel things, that this is the very circumstance which renders them more intolerable. When the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is no relief to him who is wounded, to re∣flect, that the hand which shot him was a fair one.</P>
<P>Many women, when they have a fa∣vorite point to gain, or an earnest wish to bring any one over to their opini∣on, often use a very disingenious me∣thod: they will state a cause ambigu∣ously, and then avail themselves of it, in whatever manner shall best answer their purpose; leaving your mind in a state of indecision as to their real
<PB N="112" REF="024450_0115_0FC74AE64732B660"/>
meaning, while they triumph in the perplexity they have given you, by the unfair conclusions they draw, from premises equivocally stated. They will also frequently argue from excep∣tions instead of rules, and are astonish∣ed when you are not willing to be con∣tented with a prejudice, instead of a reason.</P>
<P>In a sensible company of both sex∣es, where women are not restrained by any other reserve than what their na∣tural modesty imposes—and where the intimacy of all parties authorises the utmost freedom of communication—should any one enquire what were the general sentiments on some particular subject, it will, I believe, commonly happen that the ladies, whose imagi∣nations have kept pace with the narra∣tion, have anticipated its end, and are ready to deliver their sentiments on it, as soon as it is finished. While some
<PB N="113" REF="024450_0116_0FC74AE7C4FA23B0"/>
male hearers, whose minds were busi∣ed in settling the propriety, comparing the circumstances, and examining the consistencies of what was said, are o∣bliged to pause and discriminate, before they think of answering. Nothing is so embarrassing as a variety of matter; and the conversation of women is often more perspicuous, because it is less la∣bored.</P>
<P>A man of deep reflection, if he does not keep up an intimate com∣merce with the world, will be some∣times so entangled in the intricacies of intense thought, that he will have the appearance of a confused and perplex∣ed expression; while a sprightly wo∣man will extricate herself with that lively and "rash dexterity," which will almost always please, though it is very far from being always right. It is easier to confound than to convince an opponent; the former may be ef∣fected
<PB N="114" REF="024450_0117_0FC74AEF34055E18"/>
by a turn that has more happi∣ness than truth in it. Many an excellent reasoner, well skilled in the theory of the schools, has felt himself discomfited by a reply, which, though as wide of the mark, and as foreign to the quest∣ion, as can be conceived, has discon∣certed him more than the most start∣ling proposition, or the most accurate chain of reasoning could have done; and he has borne the laugh of his fair antagonist, as well as of the whole company, though he could not but feel, that his own argument was at∣tended with the fullest demonstration: so true it is, that it is not always ne∣cessary to be right, in order to be ap∣plauded.</P>
<P>But let not a young lady's vanity be too much elated with this false applause, which is given, not to merit, but to her sex: she has not, perhaps, gained a victory, though she may be allowed a
<PB N="115" REF="024450_0118_0FC74AEFF8269A70"/>
triumph; and it should humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her strength, but to her weakness. It is worth while to discriminate between that applause, which is given from the complaisance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</P>
<P>Where great sprightliness is the na∣tural bent of the temper, girls should endeavor to habituate themselves to a custom of observing, thinking, and rea∣soning. I do not mean that they should devote themselves to abstruse speculation, or the study of logic; but she, who is accustomed to give a due arrangement to her thoughts, to rea∣son justly and pertinently, on common affairs, and judiciously to deduce ef∣fects from their causes, will be a better logician than some of those who claim the name, because they have studied the art: this is being <Q>learned with∣out the rules;</Q> the best definition,
<PB N="116" REF="024450_0119_0FC74AF331D6A2F0"/>
perhaps, of that sort of literature which is properest for the sex. That species of knowledge, which appears to be the result of reflection rather than of science, sits peculiarly well on wo∣men. It is not uncommon to find a lady, who, though she does not know a rule of syntax, scarcely ever violates one, and who constructs every sentence she utters, with more propriety than many a learned dunce, who has every rule of Aristotle by heart, and who can lace his own thread-bare discourse with the golden shreds of Cicero and Virgil.</P>
<P>It has been objected, and I fear with some reason, that female conversation is too frequently tinctured with a cen∣sorious spirit, and that ladies are sel∣dom apt to discover much tenderness for the errors of a fallen sister.
<Q>If it be so, it is a grievous fault.</Q>
<PB N="117" REF="024450_0120_0FC74AF4856FA1D0"/>
No arguments can justify, no pleas can extenuate it. To exult over the miseries of an unhappy creature is in∣human: not to compassionate them is unchristian. The worthy part of the sex always express themselves humane∣ly on the failings of others, in propor∣tion to their own undeviating good∣ness.</P>
<P>And here I cannot help remarking; that young women do not always care∣fully distinguish between running in∣to the error of detraction, and its op∣posite extreme of indiscriminate ap∣plause. This proceeds from the false idea they entertain, that the direct con∣trary to what is wrong, must be right. Thus the dread of being only suspected of one fault, makes them actually guilty of another. The desire of a∣voiding the imputation of envy, im∣pels them to be insincere; and to esta∣blish
<PB N="118" REF="024450_0121_0FC74AF5F5AF9378"/>
a reputation for sweetness of tem∣per and generosity, they affect some∣times to speak of very indifferent cha∣racters with the most extravagant ap∣plause. With such the hyperbole is a favorite figure; and every degree of comparison, but the superlative, is re∣jected, as cold and inexpressive. But this habit of exaggeration greatly weakens their credit, and destroys the weight of their opinion on other oc∣casions; for people very soon discover what degree of faith is to be given both to their judgment and veracity. And those of real merit will no more be flattered by that approbation, which cannot distinguish the value of what it praises, than the celebrated painter must have been at the judgment passed on his works by an ignorant spectator, who, being asked what he thought of such and such very capital, but very
<PB N="119" REF="024450_0122_0FC74B01B9FEFC20"/>
different pieces, cried out in an affect∣ed rapture, "All alike! all alike!"</P>
<P>It has been proposed to the young, as a maxim of supreme wisdom, to manage so dexterously in conversation, as to appear to be well acquainted with subjects, of which they are totally ig∣norant; and this, by affecting silence in regard to those, on which they are known to excel.—But why counsel this disingenuous fraud? Why add to the numberless arts of deceit, this prac∣tice of deceiving, as it were, on a set∣tled principle? If to disavow the know∣ledge they really have, be a culpable affectation, then certainly to insinuate an idea of their skill where they are actually ignorant, is a most unworthy artifice.</P>
<P>But of all the qualifications for con∣versation, humility, if not the most brilliant, is the safest, the most amia∣ble, and the most feminine. The af∣fectation
<PB N="120" REF="024450_0123_0FC74B08A36B7970"/>
of introducing subjects, with which others are unacquainted, and of displaying talents superior to the rest of the company, is as dangerous as it is foolish.</P>
<P>There are many, who never can forgive another for being more agree∣able and more accomplished than themselves, and who can pardon any offence rather than an eclipsing merit. Had the nightingale in the fable, con∣quered his vanity, and resisted the temptation of showing a fine voice, he might have escaped the talons of the hawk. The melody of his singing was the cause of his destruction; his merit brought him into danger, and his vanity cost him his life.</P>

<P>AMONG the many evils which prevail under the sun, the a∣buse of words is not the least conside∣rable. By the influence of time, and the perversion of fashion, the plainest and most unequivocal may be so alter∣ed, as to have a meaning assigned them almost diametrically opposite to their original signification.</P>
<P>The present age may be termed, by way of distinction, the age of senti∣ment, a word, which, in the implica∣tion it now bears, was unknown to our plain ancestors. Sentiment is
<PB N="122" REF="024450_0125_0FC74B0BC83E3EA8"/>
the varnish of virtue, to conceal the deformity of vice; and it is not un∣common for the same persons to make a jest of religion, to break through the most solemn ties and engagements, to practise every art of latent fraud and open seduction, and yet to value them∣selves on speaking and writing <HI>senti∣mentally.</HI></P>
<P>But this refined jargon, which has infected letters, and tainted morals, is chiefly admired and adopted by <HI>young ladies</HI> of a certain turn, who read <HI>sen∣timental books,</HI> write <HI>sentimental letters,</HI> and contract <HI>sentimental friendships.</HI></P>
<P>Error is never likely to do so much mischief, as when it disguises its real tendency, and puts on an engaging and attractive appearance. Many a young woman, who would be shock∣ed at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely flattered at the idea of a sentimental connexion, though per∣haps
<PB N="123" REF="024450_0126_0FC74B0E4E1E9408"/>
with a dangerous and designing man, who, by putting on this mark of plausibility and virtue, disarms her of her prudence, lays her apprehensions asleep, and involves her in misery—misery the more inevitable, because unsuspected. For she who apprehends no danger, will not think it necessary to be always upon her guard; but will rather invite than avoid the ruin, which comes under so specious and so fair a form.</P>
<P>Such an engagement will be infinite∣ly dearer to her vanity, than an avowed and authorized attachment; for one of these sentimental lovers will not scruple very seriously to assure a cre∣dulous girl, that her unparalleled me∣rit entitles her to the adoration of the whole world, and that the universal homage of mankind, is nothing more than the unavoidable tribute extorted by her charms. No wonder then, the
<PB N="124" REF="024450_0127_0FC74B10DA9782A8"/>
should be so easily prevailed on to be∣lieve, that an individual is captivated by perfections which might enslave a million. But she should remember, that he, who endeavours to intoxicate her with adulation, intends one day most effectually to humble her. For an artful man has always a secret de∣sign to pay himself in future for eve∣ry present sacrifice. And this prodi∣gality of praise, which he now appears to lavish with such thoughtless profu∣sion, is, in fact, a sum economically laid out to supply his future necessi∣ties; of this sum he keeps an exact esti∣mate, and at some distant day promi∣ses himself the most exorbitant interest for it. If he has address and conduct, and the object of his pursuit much va∣nity, and some sensibility, he seldom fails of success; for so powerful will be his ascendancy over his mind, that she will soon adopt his notions and o∣pinions.
<PB N="125" REF="024450_0128_0FC74B13678D9088"/>
Indeed it is more than pro∣bable she possessed most of them before, having gradually acquired them in her initiation into the sentimental charac∣ter. To maintain that character with dignity and propriety, it is necessary she should entertain the most elevated ideas of disproportionate alliances, and disinterested love; and consider for∣tune, rank, and reputation, as mere chimerical distinctions and vulgar pre∣judices.</P>
<P>The lover, deeply versed in all the obliquities of fraud, and skilled to wind himself into every avenue of the heart, which indiscretion has left un∣guarded, soon discovers on which side it is most accessible. He avails him∣self of this weakness by addressing her in a language exactly consonant to her own ideas. He attacks her with her own weapons, and opposes rhapsody to sentiment. He professes so sove∣reign
<PB N="126" REF="024450_0129_0FC74B1B94ECDB78"/>
a contempt for the paltry con∣cerns of money, that she thinks it her duty to reward him for so generous a renunciation. Every plea he artfully advances of his own unworthiness, is considered by her as a fresh demand, which her gratitude must answer; And she makes it a point of honor to sacrifice to him that fortune which he is too noble to regard. These profes∣sions of humility are the common arti∣fice of the vain; and these protestati∣ons of generosity the refuge of the ra∣pacious. And among its many smooth mischiefs, it is one of the sure and suc∣cessful frauds of sentiment, to affect the most frigid indifference to those external and pecuniary advantages, which it is its great and real object to obtain.</P>
<P>A sentimental girl very rarely en∣tertains any doubt of her personal beauty; for she has been daily accus∣tomed
<PB N="127" REF="024450_0130_0FC74B1E6AB8B8C8"/>
to contemplate it herself, and to hear of it from others. She will not therefore be very solicitous for the con∣firmation of a truth so self-evident; but she suspects, that her pretensions to understanding are more likely to be disputed, and, for that reason, greedily devours every compliment offered to those perfections, which are less obvi∣ous and more refined, She is persua∣ded that men need only open their eyes to decide on her beauty, while it will be the most convincing proof of the taste, sense, and elegance of her admirer, that he can discern and flat∣ter those qualities in her. A man of the character here supposed, will easi∣ly insinuate himself into her affections by means of this latent but leading foi∣ble, which may be called the guiding clue to a sentimental heart. He will affect to overlook that beauty which attracts common eyes, and ensnares
<PB N="128" REF="024450_0131_0FC74B1F508AD530"/>
common hearts, while he will bestow the most delicate praises to the beauties of her mind, and finish the climax of adu∣lation, by hinting that she is superior to it.</P>

<P>But nothing, in general, can end less delightfully than these sublime at∣tachments, even where no acts of se∣duction are ever practised, but they are suffered, like mere sublunary con∣nexions, to terminate in the vulgar ca∣tastrophe of marriage. That wealth, which lately seemed to be looked on with ineffable contempt by the lover, now appears to be the principal attrac∣tion in the eyes of the husband: and he, who but a few short weeks before, in a transport of sentimental generosi∣ty, wished her to have been a village maid, with no portion but her crook

and her beauty, and that they might spend their days in pastoral love and innocence, has now lost all relish for the Arcadian life, or any other life in which she must be his companion.</P>
<P>On the other hand she who was lately
<Q>An angel call'd, and angel-like ador'd,</Q>
is shocked to find herself at once strip∣ped of all her celestial attributes. This late divinity, who scarcely yielded to her sisters of the sky, now finds herself of less importance in the esteem of the man she has chosen, than any other mere mortal woman. No longer is she gratified with the tear of counter∣feited passion, the sigh of dissembled rapture, or the language of premedita∣ted adoration. No longer is the altar of her vanity loaded with the oblati∣ons

Her faults, which were so lately overlooked, or mistaken for virtues, are now, as Cassius says, set in a note∣book. The passion which was vowed eternal, lasted only a few short weeks; and the indifference, which was so far from being included in the bargain, that it was not so much as suspected, follows them through the whole tire∣some journey of their insipid, vacant, joyless existence.</P>
<P>Thus much for the <HI>completion</HI> of the sentimental history. If we trace it back to its beginning, we shall find, that a damsel of this cast had her head originally turned by pernicious read∣ing,
<PB N="131" REF="024450_0134_0FC74B2478F538F8"/>
and her insanity confirmed by im∣prudent friendships. She never fails to select a beloved <HI>confidante</HI> of her own turn and humor, though, if she can help it, not quite so handsome as herself. A violent intimacy ensues, or, to speak the language of sentiment, an intimate union of souls immediately takes place, which is wrought to the highest pitch, by a secret and volumi∣nous correspondence, though they live in the same street, or perhaps in the same house. This is the fuel which principally feeds and supplies the dan∣gerous flame of sentiment. In this correspondence the two friends en∣courage each other in the falsest noti∣ons imaginable. They represent ro∣mantic love as the great important bu∣siness of human life, and describe all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry to merit the attention of such e∣levated beings, and fit only to employ
<PB N="132" REF="024450_0135_0FC74B3147DE9A48"/>
the daughters of the plodding vulgar. In these letters, family affairs are mis∣represented, family secrets divulged, and family misfortunes aggravated. They are filled with vows of eternal a∣mity, and protestations of never-end∣ing love. But interjections and quo∣tations are the principal embellish∣ments of these very sublime epistles. Every panegyric contained in them is extravagant and hyperbolical, every censure exaggerated and excessive. In a favorite, every frailty is heightened into a perfection, and in a foe, degra∣ded into a crime. The dramatic po∣ets, especially the most tender and ro∣mantic, are quoted in almost every line, and every pompous or pathetic thought is forced to give up its natural and ob∣vious meaning, and, with all the vio∣lence of misapplication, is compelled to suit some circumstance of imaginary woe of the fair transcriber.

<P>Fathers <HI>have flinty hearts,</HI> is an ex∣pression worth an empire, and is al∣ways used with peculiar emphasis and enthusiasm. For a favorite topic of these epistles is the groveling spirit and sordid temper of the parents, who will be sure to find no quarter at the hands of their daughters, should they pre∣sume to be so unreasonable as to direct their course of reading, interfere in their choice of friends, or interrupt their very important correspondence. But as these young ladies are fertile in expedients, and as their genius is ne∣ver more agreeably exercised than in finding resources, they are not without their secret exultation, in case, either of the above interesting events should happen, as they carry with them a cer∣tain air of tyranny and persecution
<PB N="134" REF="024450_0137_0FC74B3443E0E798"/>
which is very delightful. For a pro∣hibited correspondence is one of the great incidents of a sentimental life—and a letter clandestinely received, the supreme felicity of a sentimental lady.</P>
<P>Nothing can equal the astonishment of these soaring spirits, when their plain friends or prudent relations presume to remonstrate with them on any impropriety in their conduct. But if these worthy people happen to be somewhat advanced in life, their contempt is then a little softened by pity, at the reflection that such very antiquated, poor creatures should pre∣tend to judge what is fit or unfit, for ladies of their great refinement, sense, and reading. They consider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the sub∣lime pleasures of a dilicate and exalt∣ed passion; as tyrants whose authority is to be contemned, and as spies whose vigilance is to be eluded. The pru∣dence

of these worthy friends they term suspicion, and their experience dotage. For they are persuaded, that the face of things has so totally chang∣ed, since their parents were young, that though they might then judge tolera∣bly for themselves, yet they are now (with all their advantages of know∣ledge and observation; by no means qualified to direct their more enlight∣ened daughters; who, if they have made a great progress in the sentimen∣tal walk, will be no more influenced by the advice of their mother, than they would go abroad in her laced pin∣ner, or her brocade suit.</P>
<P>But young people never show their folly and ignorance more conspicuous∣ly, than by this over confidence in their own judgment, and this haughty disdain of the opinion of those who have known more days. Youth has a quickness of apprehension, which it
<PB N="136" REF="024450_0139_0FC74B3B1283CAB8"/>
is apt to mistake for an acuteness of pe∣netration. But youth, like cunning, though very conceited, is very short∣sighted, and never more so than when it disregards the instructions of the wise, and the admonitions of the aged. The same vices and follies influenced the human heart in their day, which influence it now, and nearly in the same manner. One, who well knew the world and its various vanities, has said: <Q>The thing which hath been, it is that which shall be, and that which is done is that which shall be done, and there is no new thing un∣der the sun.</Q></P>
<P>It is also a part of the sentimental character, to imagine that none but the young, and the beautiful have any right to the pleasures of society, or e∣ven to the common benefits and bles∣sings of life. Ladies of this turn also affect the most lofty disregard for use∣ful
<PB N="137" REF="024450_0140_0FC74B3CB4879608"/>
qualities and domestic virtues, and this is a natural consequence; for as this sort of sentiment, is only a word for idleness, she who is constantly and usefully employed, has neither leisure nor propensity to cultivate it.</P>
<P>A sentimental lady principally va∣lues herself on the enlargement of her notions, and her liberal way of think∣ing. This superiority of soul chiefly manifests itself in the contempt of these minute delicacies, and little decorums, which, trifling as they may be thought, tend at once to dignify the character, and to restrain the levity of the young∣er part of the sex.</P>
<P>Perhaps the error here complained of, originates in mistaking <HI>sentiment</HI> and <HI>principle</HI> for each other. Now I conceive them to be extremely differ∣ent. Sentiment is the virtue of <HI>ideas,</HI> and principle the virtue of <HI>action.</HI> Sentiment has its seat in the head, prin∣ciple
<PB N="138" REF="024450_0141_0FC74B3EBB05E0E8"/>
in the heart. Sentiment suggests fine harangues and subtil distinctions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> principle conceives just notions, and performs good actions in consequence of them. Sentiment refines away the simplicity of truth and the plainness of piety; and, as a celebrated wit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voltaire's Prophecy concerning Rous∣seau.</NOTE> has remarked of his no less celebrated co∣temporary, gives us virtue in words and vice in deeds. Sentiment may be called the Athenian who <HI>knew</HI> what was right, and principle the Lacedemonian who <HI>practised</HI> it.</P>
<P>But these qualities will be better ex∣emplified by an attentive consideration of two admirably drawn characters of Milton, which are beautifully, delicate∣ly, and distinctly marked. These are, Belial, who may not improperly be cal∣led the <HI>Demon of Sentiment;</HI> and Ab∣diel,
<PB N="139" REF="024450_0142_0FC74B43472A2310"/>
who may be termed the <HI>Angel of Principle.</HI></P>

Now turn to the artless, upright, and unsophisticated Abdiel,

<P>But it is not from these descriptions, just and striking as they are, that their characters are so perfectly known, as from an examination of their conduct through the remainder of this divine work: in which it is well worth while to remark the consonancy of their ac∣tions, with what the above pictures seem to promise. It will also be ob∣served, that the contrast between them is kept up throughout, with the utmost
<PB N="141" REF="024450_0144_0FC74B4F6CFD8C30"/>
exactness of delineation, and the most animated strength of colouring. On a review it will be found, that Belial <HI>talked all,</HI> and Abdiel <HI>did</HI> all. The former,

<P>But notwithstanding I have spoken with some asperity against sentiment, as opposed to principle, yet I am con∣vinced, that true genuine sentiment
<PB N="143" REF="024450_0146_0FC74B5333554BE0"/>
(not the sort I have been describing) may be so connected with principle, as to bestow on it its brightest lustre, and its most captivating graces. And enthusiasm is so far from being disa∣greeable, that a portion of it is per∣haps indispensibly necessary in an en∣gaging woman. But it must be the enthusiasm of the heart, not of the senses. It must be the enthusiasm which grows up with a feeling mind, and is cherished by a virtuous educa∣tion—not that which is compounded of irregular passions, and artificially refined by books of unnatural fiction and improbable adventure. I will e∣ven go so far as to assert, that a young woman cannot have any real greatness of soul, or true elevation of principle, if she has not a tincture of what the vulgar call Romance, but which per∣sons of a certain way of thinking will discern to proceed from those fine
<PB N="144" REF="024450_0147_0FC74B589E1CA9F8"/>
feelings, and that charming sensibility, without which, though a woman may be worthy, yet she can never be ami∣able.</P>
<P>But this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very apt to lead those who possess it into incon∣veniences, from which less interesting characters are happily exempt. Young women of strong sensibility may be car∣ried by the very amiableness of this temper, into the most alarming ex∣tremes. Their tastes are passions. They love and hate with all their hearts, and scarcely suffer themselves to feel a reasonable preference, before it strengthens into a violent attachment.</P>
<P>When an innocent girl, of this open, trusting, tender heart, happens to meet with one of her own sex and age, whose address and manners are enga∣ging, she is instantly seized with an ar∣dent desire to commence a friendship
<PB N="145" REF="024450_0148_0FC74B5C080855E0"/>
with her. She feels the most lively impatience at the restraints of compa∣ny, and the decorums of ceremony. She longs to be alone with her, longs to assure her of the warmth of her tenderness, and generously ascribes to the fair stranger all the good qualities she feels in her own heart, or rather all those which she has met with in her reading, dispersed in a variety of heroines. She is persuaded, that her new friend unites them all in herself, because she carries in her prepossessing countenance the promise of them all. How cruel and how censorious would this inexperienced girl think her mo∣ther was, who should venture to hint, that the agreeable unknown had de∣fects in her temper, or exceptions in her character! She would mistake these hints of discretion for the insinu∣ations of an uncharitable disposition.
<PB N="146" REF="024450_0149_0FC74B5D860E56B8"/>
At first she would perhaps listen to them with a generous impatience, and afterwards with a cold and silent dis∣dain. She would despise them as the effect of prejudice, misrepresentation, or ignorance. The more aggravated the censure, the more vehemently would she protest in secret, that her friendship for this dear injured crea∣ture (who is raised much higher in her esteem by such injurious suspicions) shall know no bounds, as she is assu∣red it can know no end.</P>
<P>Yet this trusting confidence, this honest indiscretion, is, at this early period of life, as amiable as it is natu∣ral; and will, if wisely cultivated, produce, at its proper season, fruits in∣finitely more valuable, than all the guarded circumspection of premature, and therefore artificial prudence. Men, I believe, are seldom struck with these sudden prepossessions in favor of each
<PB N="147" REF="024450_0150_0FC74B6645BEB400"/>
other. They are not so unsuspecting, nor so easily led away by the predomi∣nance of fancy. They engage more warily, and pass through the several stages of acquaintance, intimacy, and confidence, by slower gradations; but women, if they are sometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, enjoy even then an higher degree of satisfaction, than if they never trusted. For to be always clad in the burdensome armor of suspicion, is more painful and in∣convenient, than to run the hazard of suffering now and then a transient in∣jury.</P>
<P>But the above observations only ex∣tend to the young and the inexperien∣ced; for I am very certain, that wo∣men are capable of as faithful and du∣rable friendship as any of the other sex. They can enter not only into all the enthusiastic tenderness, but into all the solid fidelity of attachment. And
<PB N="148" REF="024450_0151_0FC74B6ADFA11390"/>
if we cannot oppose instances of equal weight with those of Nysus and Eury∣alus, Theseus and Pirithous, Pylades and Orestes, let it be remembered, that it is because the recorders of those cha∣racters were men, and that the very existence of them is merely poetical.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF A REASONABLE WOMAN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a Lady.</BYLINE>
<P>AFTER a night spent in healthful repose, the reasonable woman rises in that happy tranquil frame of mind, which results from pleasant re∣flections on the past day, and anticipa∣ting the temperate pleasure and im∣portant duties of the commencing one. Its first moments are devoted as due to that Being whom she regards with filial love, gratitude, and reverence; and whom she approaches, not with the lifeless prostrations of fear, but with the devout and cheerful homage of the heart. Before engaging in domes∣tic cares, she prepares her mind for meeting with firmness, or bearing with patience, the little rubs and vexations of the day: she plans a thousand schemes of benevolence and utility;
<PB N="150" REF="024450_0153_0FC74B6D426CDD68"/>
and the good she cannot perform, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> generously intends, is recorded in hea∣ven as virtue. The time necessarily spent at her toilette, is short; it is, however, rendered pleasing by the de∣lightful hope of becoming, by means of its adventitious aids, more agreea∣ble in the eyes of a husband, whom she loves too tenderly to omit a single opportunity of complying with his taste, or confirming his esteem. Books, work, and, above all, the important duty of impressing the infant minds of her children with that love of goodness which insensibly leads to the practice of it, fill up the rest of the morning. Through the day she checks the little sallies of her own temper, and, unob∣served, steals from others, by the influ∣ence of her good humor, every disqui∣eting care. To them her time, her taste, are often sacrificed; but conscious benevolence does more than repay her▪
<PB N="151" REF="024450_0154_0FC74B6EB58D7130"/>
Her conversation, equally remote <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om chilling reserve and petulant lo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acity, has no aim, but to instruct or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use; and in her care to please o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers, she seems wholly to forget her∣self. Her elegant, yet frugal board, presents a striking emblem of her mind. There, plenty is seen without profusion, and neatness without osten∣tation. Good taste, good breeding, good sense, and mild complacency, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each her guests to forget they are stran∣gers, and to feel they are friends. Her husband beholds her with min∣gled pride and pleasure; and his ap∣probation though silent, diffuses joy through her heart, and cheerfulness through her conversation. The even∣ing is spent amidst the chosen circle, with whom she knows no reserves, and whose accumulated happiness becomes her own. Conversation, if useful or agreeable, is encouraged, if dull; re∣lieved
<PB N="152" REF="024450_0155_0FC74B75A7A28BA0"/>
by the aids which the fine arts supply to those who cultivate them. Music, dancing, cards, are occasional∣ly called in; and even those amuse∣ments for which she has no relish her∣self, she cheerfully adopts, in the hope of contributing to the enjoyment of o∣thers. Public diversions are sometimes visited, but always tend, with the rea∣sonable woman, to increase her love of social and domestic pleasures. When in public, she appears with propriety and modesty. She envies not beauty, she covets not grandeur, she seeks not to engage attention; for in the plea∣sing consciousness of discharging her duty, in the love of her husband, and esteem of her friends, she finds com∣plete happiness. Such is a Reasona∣ble Woman! The very opposite of a Fashionable one.</P>
