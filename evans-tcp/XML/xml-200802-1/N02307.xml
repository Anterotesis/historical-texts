</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N this Chapter we have holy <HI>Job</HI> religiously meditating on the <HI>Life</HI> &amp; <HI>Death</HI> of Man; com∣muning with his own Heart, and expostulating with GOD.</P>
<P>IN the first <HI>6</HI> verses, he re∣presents the shortness and un∣certainty of our Lives, the va∣nity &amp; vexation of the World, the Pollution of hu∣man Nature, and the settled Period of human Life: and urges these Considerations with GOD, as so many Pleas for Mercy and Forbearance. <HI>Man, that is born of a Woman, is of few days,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN the next place he turns his Tho'ts upon
<PB N="2" REF="002743_0003_0FE61F8FB5274108"/>
DEATH, &amp; affects himself with the dreadful Na∣ture and Consequences of it; groaning out his Soul in various Complaints, Requests, and passionate Expostulations. He realises it to himself, that Death is an awful &amp; final Remove out of the Pre∣sent World; but then refreshes himself with the Prospect of a future Resurrection, &amp; his Existence in another &amp; better World. ver. 7 — 15. <HI>For there is hope of a Tree, if it be cut down,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>HAVING said these things, he falls again into complaining Language; and tho' not utterly des∣perate, yet is hard put to it to bear up under his present Troubles. He complains of GOD's Sever∣ity in his dealings with him, as if he was strict to mark Iniquity against him; ver. 16, &amp; 17. <HI>For now thou numbrest my steps,</HI> &amp;c. In the next place he observes the decaying Condition and Mutabili∣ty of all Earthly Things: and then he speaks of it as the common Lot of all Mankind to die; and mentions the power, the terror, and the agonies of Death: ver. 18. to the end, <HI>And surely the mount∣ain falling cometh to nought,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>ALL things in Nature are subject to continual Vicissitudes, to Decays, and Desolations; even <HI>Man</HI> (the noblest of visible Creatures) not except∣ed. We are of the Earth, earthy, sprang original∣ly out of the Dust, and must return to our native Earth. The very <HI>Mountains</HI> &amp; <HI>Rocks</HI> have not such a Stability, but that they may be unfixed from their places, be removed &amp; broken to pieces, or gradually moulder away. No marvel then if frail Mankind be in a wasting Condition. The very strongest, the most healthy &amp; most powerful among
<PB N="3" REF="002743_0004_0FE61F917519FE80"/>
Men, are subject to Mortality, as well as others. Tho' they see many days, &amp; last a long time, yet sooner or later, they are worn out, as the Rocks in the Sea wax old and Stones wear away with the continual dropping of Water upon them. — And as to the Generality of Mankind, they are easily carry'd away, &amp; often suddenly, as Flowers of the Field, and tender Herbs which <HI>grow out of the dust of the Earth,</HI> by a sweeping Rain, which (as <HI>Solomon</HI> observes) leaveth no Food, but cuts off the Expectations of the Husbandman, &amp; when he looketh for much, bringeth it to little.</P>
<P>THUS saies <HI>Job,</HI> directing his Speech to the ALMIGHTY,— <HI>Thou washest away the things that grow out of the Dust of the Earth; and thou destroyest the Hope of Man. Thou prevailest for ever against him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>HERE (1.) WE have an acknowlegement of GOD's <HI>Dominion</HI> and Agency in the Affair of our <HI>Death. — Thou</HI> destroyest <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) WE have a <HI>Description</HI> of Death, by some of it's Properties, and Effects.</P>
<P>IN our Text he observes, <HI>It destroys the Hope of Man,</HI> puts a Period to all our Worldly Hopes and Projects, &amp; to the presumptuous hopes of the Hy∣pocrite. In the following verses 'tis observed:</P>
<P><HI>IT prevails for ever against him, and he passeth away.</HI> The Stroke of Death is irresistible, &amp; often makes quick dispatch. The Blow is many times given suddenly, &amp; the Man passes away; makes a speedy flight, as a timorous Bird hastens out of it's Nest when disturb'd, or as a conquer'd Soldier slys before his pursuing Adversary. — 'Tis added,</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002743_0005_0FE61F9182603B08"/><HI>IT changeth his Countenance</HI>; it's Approach is terrible, and discomposes the Mind; and it's Ex∣ecution alters the looks, slurs the Beauty of the Face, and turns it into Paleness &amp; Deformity.</P>
<P><HI>IT sends him away,</HI> — with Speed &amp; Force; out of Time into Eternity; out of a State of Pro∣bation into a State of Retribution. Finally, <HI>His sons come to Honour, and he knoweth it not, &amp; they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I shall consider at present only the Beginning of the Account here given of Death. And shall speak to it under these two Observations.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. GOD is the Sovereign Dispenser of Death.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. DEATH destroys the Hope of Man.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>GOD is the Sovereign Dispenser of Death,</HI> and the absolute Disposer of all the Circum∣stances and Consequences of it.</P>
<P><HI>JOB</HI> attributes all to GOD, — <HI>Thou</HI> destroyest the Hope of Man; <HI>Thou</HI> prevailest for ever against him,— <HI>Thou</HI> changest his Countenance, and sendest him away. — Thus he ascribes this great Event, in the several Circumstances &amp; Consequents of it unto GOD.</P>
<P>AND this Truth might be confirm'd from ma∣ny other Passages in sacred Writ. I shall here only mention that one place, where GOD himself as∣serts his Dominion over human Life, and challen∣ges it as his Prerogative to dispose of it. Deut. 32.29. <HI>See now, that I even I am HE, and there is no God with me: I kill &amp; I make alive; I wound &amp; I heal; neither is there any that can deliver out of my
<PB N="5" REF="002743_0006_0FE61F9AC9CF7D68"/>
hand.</HI> He orders &amp; disposes every thing relating to the Death of every one; the Time, the Place, the Manner, together with all the Effects, and Things which follow.</P>
<P>DEATH is no contingent or accidental Event, the fruit of Chance, but the Result of Divine Counsil &amp; Efficiency. It may be said indeed to be fortuitous or casual with respect to us, who are ignorant of futurities, and meet with many things we could not foresee, or did not expect. But GOD is perfect in Knowlege, &amp; foresees the most distant Events; and with reference to him nothing can be call'd a Contingency, Accident, or Chance. He worketh All things according to the Counsil of his own Will: &amp; in particular, He pre∣sides in the great affair of Death. Thus saith <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. 12.9, 10. <HI>Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? In whose hand is the Soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</HI> It is he turneth Man to Destruction, &amp; bringeth us to the House appointed for all Living. The Decree (wherein it's appoint∣ed unto Man once to die) came out of his Mouth; and the Execution is done by his powerful Hand. Men don't die at random, just when &amp; as it hap∣pens: but our times are in GOD's hand; He measures out our Life, &amp; determins our days; the number of our Months is with him; He hath ap∣pointed our Bounds that we cannot pass. And when the set time is come, he gives the fatal Blow, takes away our breath, and lays us in the dust. There is the hand of GOD in every one's Death, whatever be the way, &amp; means; whether it be a
<PB N="6" REF="002743_0007_0FE61F9AD34939B0"/>
natural or a violent Death; by Distempers or Disasters; if he be slain in Battel, cut off by the Sword of Justice, or stab'd by an <HI>Ehud</HI>'s Dagger <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All comes to pass by the Determination &amp; Provi∣dence of GOD. It was <HI>according to the determinate Counsel &amp; Fore-knowledge of God,</HI> that our <HI>blessed Saviour</HI> was by <HI>wicked Hands crucify'd &amp; slain.</HI> GOD directed the Arrow, when a certain Man drew his bow <HI>at a venture,</HI> and smote the King of <HI>Israel</HI> between <HI>the Joynts of the Harness.</HI> <Q>It is appointed to us, not only once to die, but <HI>how</HI> and <HI>when</HI>: the particular Time of our <HI>Birth</HI> is not more fully settled in the Counsels of GOD, than the Time of our <HI>Death.</HI></Q> There is a Time to be born, and a Time to die; a <HI>set</HI> Time for both: and GOD <HI>determineth the Times fore-appointed.</HI> <Q>It is the same Invisible Hand, which <HI>writes down</HI> our Names in <HI>the Book of the Living,</HI> and <HI>blots</HI> them out too.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is a Truth we should often meditate upon; that GOD hath the power of Life &amp; Death; and we should make a wise application hereof to the Ends of Holiness and spiritual Comfort.</P>
<P>THIS Reflection should serve to <HI>greaten and elevate our Apprehensions of the Divine Majesty.</HI> Death is one of the weightiest and most important Events. 'Tis the Destruction of an human Body, which infinite Wisdom hath fearfully and wonder∣fully made. 'Tis the dislodging of an immortal Soul; a changing of its State, &amp; translating it from a world of Sense to a world of Spirits, from a State of Trial, to a State of Rewards unknown and ever∣lasting. It is therefore a great and very awful
<PB N="7" REF="002743_0008_0FE61F9C98266368"/>
Thing to die. And it is no small Exercise of the Divine Dominion, which is seen in this Affair. Hence we should maintain a profound Reverence of GOD, in whose hand our Breath is, and should have exalted Tho'ts of Him on this account.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> THE Thought of this should <HI>strike a Ter∣ror on rebellious Sinners, and excite them to a speedy Repentance.</HI> This tells you, that your Lives are under a Divine Inspection, the most strict, ac∣curate, and never-ceasing. The LORD of all has his Eye upon you continually, observing how you fill up the measure of your Iniquity, and waiting the fit season to turn the Keys of Death &amp; Hell up∣on you. O Consider this, &amp; tremble. Your Death will certainly be a miserable one, if you die in your Sins. And you know not how soon or suddenly you may have the fatal Summons serv'd upon you. The Providence of GOD is at this day calling aloud on you in several sudden Deaths. It is owing intirely to the Patience &amp; Forbearance of a good and merciful GOD, that you are spared, &amp; have had your Lives lengthen'd out hitherto. You are continually abusing this Patience by your Rebellion and Impenitence. And if you go on in your Tres∣passes, there is hazard lest abused Patience should break out into inflamed Wrath, &amp; cut you down as Cumberers of the Ground, &amp; cast you as fit Fewel into the Everlasting Burnings. GOD has said, <HI>My Spirit shall not always strive with man.</HI> O secure Sinners, think of this, &amp; tremble lest Divine Vengence should kindle against you, &amp; burn to the lowest Hell. — The Doctrine before us reads loud Lessons of Terror to the Wicked. O that such
<PB N="8" REF="002743_0009_0FE61F9C9F771D60"/>
would hear &amp; fear &amp; no longer harden their Hearts, but to Day while it is called to day, hearken to the Casts of the Gospel, &amp; turn from their evil ways, that they perish not. But then further,</P>
<P>IT reads sweet Lectures of <HI>Consolation to the Children of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>UNDER the Difficulties &amp; Troubles of Life, in <HI>general,</HI> it should minister Support &amp; Comfort to Believers, to consider that GOD is the Sovereign LORD of Life &amp; Death. However your Lives may be embitter'd to you by a Variety of Afflictions; so that you may be even weary of Life, and be tempted (with <HI>Job</HI>) to wish for Death, yet remem∣ber it is GOD who continues your Lives, and de∣lays your Death; HE performeth the Thing that is appointed for you; and let this Tho't teach you a humble Submission &amp; patient Waiting. And re∣member that er'e long He will command Delive∣rance for you; will give you a Quietus, and bring you to the Rest which remains for the People of GOD. The prospect of this shou'd calm your Spi∣rit, and make you easy under all your present Trials —.</P>
<P>BUT in particular, under <HI>Bereavements,</HI> the Tho't of GOD's Dominion over Death should be quieting to you. <HI>Job</HI> composed himself with this consideration, — <HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,</HI> (Job 1.21.) Let such as are Mourning under bereaving Dispensations, eye the hand of GOD. You may not with the ignorant &amp; foolish <HI>Philistins</HI> make a Doubt, Whether it is GOD who hath done this Evil, or whether it is a Chance that hath happened to you. You must not impute it to
<PB N="9" REF="002743_0010_0FE61FA771D8AA78"/>
second Causes merely; but look above &amp; beyond Instruments &amp; Means to the Prime Efficient, and acknowledge with <HI>Naomi,</HI> That <HI>the Hand of the Lord</HI> is gone out against you. Realize the Agency of Divine Providence in your Afflictions, and in the midst of your disquieting Tho'ts within you, let this Reflection comfort you. Remember <HI>Who</HI> it is that has laid you under these bereavements. He is One absolutely <HI>Sovereign</HI> and giveth not ac∣count of any of his Matters. Why then shouldest thou strive against Him? Wo to him, who striveth with his Maker! Behold, He taketh away, and who can hinder him, or who may say to him. What doest Thou? Behold in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, That GOD is greater than Man! Again, He is One Infinitely <HI>Wife</HI>; and therefore knows what is best &amp; fittest to be done, and even how to bring Good out of Evil. Is it not then both a Duty and a Decency in you to acquiesce in his Pleasure, with the highest Satisfaction? Moreover, He is infinitely <HI>Good</HI> &amp; Gracious, and has engag'd himself by his faithful <HI>Promise,</HI> to employ his Wis∣dom &amp; Power in making all things work together for your final and best Advantage; so that you shall be spiritual Gainers by your temporal Losses &amp; Bereavements. O how should this Tho't sustain, animate &amp; comfort you! I shall only subjoyn, You may fetch in additional Consolations from the prospect of that <HI>Happiness</HI> &amp; <HI>Glory,</HI> which such of your deceased Friends, as were Pious, are gone to inherit, and which shall be abundantly increased at their future Resurrection. It is GOD who has ta∣ken them away; and you must needs conclude
<PB N="10" REF="002743_0011_0FE61FA778CD1788"/>
from his Love to his People, and from his gracious Promises to them, that he has remov'd them into a State more excellent &amp; happy, than that they were in here; and that he will raise up their Bodies at the last day, to Glory, Blessedness &amp; Immortality. So that not a Tear nor Sigh is due on the score of the departed Godly, who are pleased with the Change which we lament. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. Take them for a Spunge, to dry up all your excessive Tears; and let not immoderate Resentments prevail over you, to the dishonour of GOD, and the prejudice of your own Souls. At least, let your Resentments turn upon <HI>Sin,</HI> the grand Occasion &amp; Procurer of Death: <HI>Hear the Lord's Controversy with you,</HI> and inquire into the Grounds of it; O humble your selves un∣der his mighty hand, and learn Righteousness from his Judgments; knowing that He will one day call you to an Account for your Afflictions, as so many Talents, put into your Hands to improve for his Glory.</P>
<P>Further, THE Doctrine before us should teach us all to be <HI>Thankful to GOD for the Preservation of our Lives hitherto,</HI> and <HI>to trust in him for the future Continuance of them.</HI> We live in the midst of dan∣ger, are encompass'd with innumerable Evils; and it is of the Lord's Mercies we are not consumed. To him give the Glory of past Preservations; and in him let us put our Confidence for the future. What Time we are afraid, let us trust in the Lord: when our Lives are in hazard by Sickness, by Ac∣cidents, by the Rage of Creatures, let us confide in GOD, and be quiet from the fear of Death. If
<PB N="11" REF="002743_0012_0FE61FA886A9F2A8"/>
He cover us with his Feathers, we are safe, and need not fear whrt Men or Devils can do unto us. Prov. 26.2. <HI>As the bird by wandring, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.</HI> We should trust in GOD as the GOD of our Life, for the preservation of it, and for all the Blessings need∣ful to sweeten it to us: and we should resign to his Will, as to the Time &amp; Manner of our Death. We should daily by Faith be putting over ourselves into his safe and glorious Hands, and commit the keeping of our Souls, and ordering of our Bodies and all our Concerns wholly unto Him; from a realising view of his Sovereignty, Goodness, and Wisdom.</P>
<P>Finally, WHAT has been said shou'd <HI>give Check to all inordinate Fears of Men,</HI> however they may set themselves against us, or any of GOD's People. Are we apprehensive of Danger to ourselves, or to the Publick, or to the Church of GOD abroad, from subtil &amp; powerful Enemies? Do Tyrants &amp; Op∣pressors arise, and do they breathe out Threatnings and Slaughter? This is our Comfort, Their Breath (as well as ours) is in GOD's hand; and tho' they may be called gods, they shall die like men. The LORD, when he pleaseth, can dash them to pieces with his strong Arm, and cover them with shame, can bring down the glory of their high looks, and cast their Throne down to the Ground, by one easy instantaneous Blow, either with or without In∣struments. It was the Word of the LORD to the Prince of <HI>Tyre,</HI> Ezek. 28.8—10. <HI>They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. Wilt
<PB N="12" REF="002743_0013_0FE61FA89024A120"/>
thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man and no God in the hand of him that slayeth thee. Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised, by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God. — Pharaoh,</HI> that oppressor of GOD's Israel, was drowned in the Red Sea. So <HI>Herod</HI> the King who vexed the Church, was smote by the Angel of the Lord, &amp; devoured of Worms. Thus those Persecutors were stopt in their furious Career; by the Blast of GOD, they perish'd out of the Earth, &amp; went where the Wicked cease from troubling. Wait on the Lord then, &amp; keep his way. Fret not thy self because of evil doors; neither be afraid of Dying Creatures tho' they plot against the just, &amp; bend their Bow, to slay such as be of upright Conversation. The wrath of Man shall praise GOD, &amp; the Remainder thereof shall be restrained. Lo, I have seen the Wicked in great power &amp; spreading himself like a green Bay-Tree, yet he passed away; and lo, he was not. The Sal∣vation of the Righteous is of the Lord, and unto GOD belong the Issues from Death, <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.14. <HI>He shall redeem their Soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.13, 14. <HI>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? But and if ye suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled</HI>;</P>
<P>I come now to the other Observation.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>DEATH destroyes all Earthly and False hopes,</HI> and puts a period to the Expecta∣tions &amp; Projects of the Men of this World.</P>
<P>SO in our Text — <HI>Thou destroyest the hope of
<PB N="13" REF="002743_0014_0FE61FB10BFD1398"/>
Man.</HI> <Q>Death is the Destruction of all those Hopes which are built on Worldly Confidences, and confin'd to Worldly Comforts. Hope in Christ and hope of Heaven [well grounded] Death will consummate and not destroy.</Q> But it destroys the Hope, which is Worldly or False. We read 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.15. <HI>Our days on Earth are a shadow, and there is none abiding,</HI> or no Expecta∣tion, as it might be render'd, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11.7. <HI>When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>IT puts a period to all Worldly Projects, to all Earthly Hopes,</HI> and the prospects of Temporal Glory and Happiness, which vain Man is so apt to flatter himself with. Death puts an end to his tem∣poral Life and Abode here on Earth; and together therewith, to all his Worldly Employments and Designs, as well as Enjoyments and Possessions. Death turns us out of our several Callings, Relati∣ons &amp; Secular Capacities, &amp; leaves us no more opportunity to attend the common works of Life, and pursue any designs relating to the present World. Thus we read, <HI>Eccle.</HI> 9.10. <HI>There is no work, nor device, nor knowlege, nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest.</HI> So Psal. 146.4. <HI>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts perish.</HI> The meaning is not, that the Soul then passes into a tho'tless, stupid in∣dolent State, &amp; loses its power of Cogitation, No, but it imports, that a Period is then put to the De∣signs they formed for this World. When Death comes, they can no longer prosecute the Schemes they have laid for Worldly Gains, Pleasures or Pre∣ferments.
<PB N="14" REF="002743_0015_0FE61FB1141FD330"/>
In that very day the Plans they have laid perish: "their designs die with them, their Thoughts vanish with their Breath! — In one Moment all their Hopes are dash't; their Desires, and their Expectations perish forever.</P>
<P>HENCE, <HI>Let us not put our Trust in Men</HI>; whose Lives, however important &amp; useful, are un∣certain; and therefore our Expectations from them very precarious, &amp; easily defeated. Hear the Pro∣phet's Advice, <HI>Isa.</HI> 2.2 2. <HI>Cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be ac∣counted of</HI>? Surely Man is like to Vanity; his days are as a Shadow that passeth away. Men of low degree are Vanity: and Men of high degree are a Lye. Hear the Psalmist's Advice, <HI>Psal.</HI> 146.3, 4, 5. <HI>Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts perish. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God</HI>: "This is a Life, &amp; Will, &amp; Power we may depend upon".</P>
<P>Again, <HI>LET us not be high minded and trust in uncertain Riches.</HI> We must not fix our Desires and Hopes on the things of Time &amp; Sense: we must not conceive too big Hopes, nor indulge too perempt∣ory Expectations; but always project &amp; act with an absolute Resignation to GOD, &amp; sit loose from the World, as Pilgrims &amp; Strangers upon Earth. Let us not put on too much Confidence, nor flatter and please ourselves too much with Worldly Hopes and Views at any time. Hear the Wise Man's Caution, Prov. 27.1, 24. <HI>Boast not thy self of to mor∣row; for thou knowest not what a day may bring
<PB N="15" REF="002743_0016_0FE61FB2BA5745B0"/>
forth. — For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation</HI>? Remember the Admonition of our Saviour, in the Parable of the Rich Fool, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.16—22. And that of the A∣postle, <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.13—15. [Which, you'l do well to turn to and read.]</P>
<P>LET us not be immoderately <HI>anxious,</HI> nor spend too much of our Time in unprofitable Projections, about the perishing Enjoyments of the Life which now is. But let us be laying Schemes for <HI>Eternity,</HI> which will never perish; and be forming Designs of Good (Spiritual Good) to coming Generations. We should be projecting proper Methods to serve Poste∣rity, as well as the present Generation in their Reli∣gious Interests: particularly by devoting of our E∣states to Pious Uses, by the Pious Education of our Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus we shall lay the Foundations of peculiar Benefit &amp; Service to the World, after we are Dead. But especially we should be wisely lay∣ing Schemes for a <HI>Blessed Immortality</HI>: we are hidden to lay up Treasures in Heaven, to lay up in store a good Foundation against the time to come, that we may lay hold on Eternal Life. — We are here upon our good Behaviour, in a state of Trial for Eternity. Great then is the Folly of the Men of this World, who only seek a Portion under the Sun, and terminate all their Tho'ts &amp; Cares &amp; Hopes upon Sublunary things. They set their Hearts on that <HI>which is not,</HI> &amp; neglect the great Salvation which is the <HI>one thing needful.</HI> Verily this their Way is their Folly. O let us beware of such e∣gregious Folly. Eccl. 11.8. <HI>But if a man live ma∣ny years, and rejoyce in them all; yet let him re∣member
<PB N="16" REF="002743_0017_0FE61FB2C5AC35A0"/>
the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.</HI> Let us shew our selves <HI>Men,</HI> by applying all our Powers to secure the great Interests of our Souls &amp; Eternity, which will never fail, &amp; which are of the highest possible value and importance. Let us look off from this present World, retire from it in our Thoughts, Affections and Pursuits; live above its frowns &amp; flatteries, and pass the time of our Sojourning here in the fear of GOD. Let us look into the coming World, ex∣tend our Cares, Designs &amp; Hopes beyond the Li∣mits of fleeting Time; and seek another Country even an Heavenly. Let us make it the great Business of our Lives to provide for the next World, and secure to our selves an Inheritance among the Saints in Light. And considering the shortness and uncertainty of our opportunities, <HI>let us make Haste.</HI> We are frequently warned of GOD, both in his Word &amp; Providence, to prepare for Death. The Voice of the Lord crieth aloud to the City, (in the late sudden Deaths, which have alarm'd the Town) in such moving Language as that—BE YE ALSO READY, <HI>for ye know not the day nor the hour.</HI> O let us fear GOD, and receive In∣struction: let us number our days, &amp; apply our Hearts unto Wisdom. Hear, ye Old Men, and be wise, &amp; understand this. And hear, ye Children! O Young Man Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy Youth, lest the Iniquity of thy Heels overtake thee, &amp; thou be snared in an evil time, and mourn at the last, saying How have I hated Instruction! Verily Death (that irresistible De∣vourer of all false hope &amp; peace) is coming, yea it
<PB N="17" REF="002743_0018_0FE5F415EB86CAB0"/>
hastens greatly upon us, when the day of Salvation will end. Now is the day of Salvation; now is the accepted time. Death will conclude the season of Grace: and then there will be no retrieving lost opportunities; 'twill be too late to Repent, too late to obtain Mercy, too late to work out our Salvation. It must be done <HI>Now or Never.</HI> When we have once put off the Body, we shall never return into it, to redress the Errors of our former Lives; but must receive our Reward, according to the things already done in the Body, whether good or bad. <HI>After Death comes the Judgment,</HI> even eternal Judgment, an irresistible Doom. After that we shall no more have the offers of Salvation made to us; nor any more Enjoy the Hopes &amp; Means of Grace; but shall be fixed in an everlasting State. We have only the present short Life to work in and prepare for an eternal World. We had need then be up &amp; doing As our Lord said, Joh 9.4. <HI>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work.</HI> Let us make haste and not delay. It is high time to awake unto Righteousness. Let us not be secure, and trifle away our time in idleness, putting far away the evil day: but let us do with Might, with Speed and Vigour, what our hand findeth to do, redeeming the Time. Let us not content ourselves with empty wishes, and unactive Resolutions; for in the day of Death all our Tho'ts will perish, and avail us nothing, unless now put in Execution.</P>
<P>AND let us see to it that we be <HI>Sincere,</HI> that our Hearts be right with GOD, and sound in his Sta∣tutes; that we so number our days, as indeed to
<PB N="18" REF="002743_0019_0FE61FBC7333ECE8"/>
apply our <HI>Hearts</HI> unto Wisdom. Let no man de∣ceive Himself. Be not deceived: GOD is not mocked. But whatsoever a Man soweth, that shall he also reap. He that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap Life everlasting. But he that sow∣eth to the Flesh, shall of the Flesh reap Corruption and Death. Let us see to it that we be indeed the Children of GOD by Faith in Christ Jesus: and if Children, then shall we be <HI>Heirs</HI> of GOD, and joynt Heirs with Jesus Christ; we shall receive the End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</P>
<P>BUT if we are not the Children of GOD, if we do not truly believe in CHRIST, and live Godly in him, but prove finally the Children of this World, we shall certainly perish, and our Hope shall perish: which brings me to say,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>DEATH destroys the Hope of the Hypo∣crite,</HI> and puts an End to all his Dreams of Heaven and Happiness. The Righteous hath Hope in his Death, and becomes an Heir according to the hope of eternal Life. But the Way of the wicked shall perish, and the Expectation of the Hypocrite shall perish. If we die in our Sins, verily Hell will be our portion; we shall lie down in sorrow and be doomedd to everlasting Despair: If we die Hy∣pocrites, verily all Hope will die with us, and no∣thing but Misery and Confusion remain for us. However we may now flatter ourselves in our own Eyes and rejoyce in our Boastings, we shall then be shaken out of all our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rusts and have an End put to all our Triumphs. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Hypocrites <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> compared to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ush</HI> and the <HI>Flag,</HI> which tho' they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> green &amp; verdant for a while,
<PB N="19" REF="002743_0020_0FE61FBD814FC120"/>
and out-strip the Grass, yet are hollow and empty, have no solid Foundation, or Consistence in their Nature, and wither presently before any other herb. Even so (says he) are the paths of all that forget GOD, <HI>and the Hypocrite's Hope shall perish.</HI> His Hope shall be cut off, and his Trust shall be a <HI>Spi∣der</HI>'s <HI>Web</HI> (woven out of his own bowels, light and airy, and easily swept away by the besome of Destruction:) He may lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he may hold it fast, but it shall not endure. All the false Confidences of Hypocrites will fail them in the day of Wrath; their sandy Foundations will crumble under them in the Storm that's coming, and they themselves shall perish in the Ruines. The Refuges of Lies will be swept a∣way; and all their bright Thoughts of Heaven and Happiness shall end in black Despair.</P>
<P>WHILE here in this World, Sinners in <HI>Zion</HI> are many times carnally confident and at ease; They speak Peace &amp; promise Safety to their Souls. They value themselves upon their extraordinary Gifts, on their Gospel-priviledges, on their Religious Profes∣sion and Performances, and the like: but these will all prove vain Pleas, and avail them nothing. Of this we are assur'd by the Judge himself, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.21—27. So in the Parable of the Virgins, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.1—12. [Which Scriptures for brevity sake, I must only turn you to.]</P>
<P>THUS the Hope of the Hypocrite shall be cut off, and destroyed for ever. Now to apply what has been said, <HI>in a hint or two.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER this, ye that forget GOD and flatter your selves with presumptuous Hopes</HI>; Let
<PB N="20" REF="002743_0021_0FE61FBD88E93830"/>
Destruction from GOD be a terror to you, and be perswaded by the Terrors of the LORD. You may now think your Mountain stands strong, and be crying <HI>Peace, Peace</HI> to your selves: but be∣hold (Thou Hypocrite) <HI>Destruction cometh,</HI> as a Whirlwind, even a Destruction without Remedy. O Remember you are ere long to DIE: and Death will storm you out of all your delusive Confidences, and pull down your towering Imaginations. Then you will see the Vanity of your present Dreams. That which is now a high Wall in your Conceit; a Munition of Rocks, and a substantial Security unto you, will then prove but a shadow, mere ap∣pearance &amp; deceit. Then you will see and bewail your Folly and Presumption; will be ashamed of your treacherous Hope, and abandon your self to everlasting Despondence, Regret &amp; Rage. — At Death there will be a fatal period of all your Joys and Hopes. Your Hope may now bud &amp; flourish, and yield unto you peaceable fruits; but verily the <HI>latter Harvest shall be a Heap in the day of Grief and of desperate sorrow.</HI></P>
<P>O that Sinners who are at ease in <HI>Zion,</HI> would hear &amp; fear, &amp; no longer delude themselves with a groundless hope. <HI>Job</HI> 15.31. <HI>Let not him that is deceived, trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</HI> Consider before it be too late, how vain &amp; destructive your false hope will prove in the end. Consider how Death is hastning upon you, which will destroy your Hope, &amp; turn it into en less Desperation. O give Credit to the Divine Threatnings, &amp; take seasonable Warning. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.18, 19. <HI>For many walk, of whom I have told you
<PB N="21" REF="002743_0022_0FE61FC4D2002398"/>
often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: Whose end is de∣struction, whose God is their belly: and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.</HI> Isa. 50.11. <HI>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass your selves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow.</HI> O Rest not easy in your present Condition. Fly for refuge to Jesus Christ &amp; lay hold on the hope set before you. Repent &amp; turn to GOD, else how shall you escape the Damnation of Hell? How shall you escape, if you neglect so great Salvation, and die in your sins? None can fly from GOD, and hide themselves in secret places. None can resist. He will prevail for ever against them, &amp; will de∣stroy all the hopes of the Wicked. And how ag∣gravated your Misery, if you perish from under the Gospel! Job 36.18. <HI>Because there is wrath, beware lest be take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</HI> To him that is joyned to the Living, there is hope, but Death destroys the hope of Sinners, destroys it <HI>totally,</HI> destroys it <HI>finally.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Word, Let us all then from what has been said, be put upon <HI>Examining our Hope,</HI> whether it be a Hope that Death cannot destroy.</P>
<P>THIS is an Inquiry of infinite Importance. It relates to our Souls, &amp; to the Eternal World; to our Spiritual &amp; Everlasting Safety &amp; Welfare: And therefore surely must deserve our Consideration, and calls for a peculiar concern that we be not deceivd about it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002743_0023_0FE61FC4DABE0608"/>BUT yet Multitudes <HI>do</HI> deceive themselves in this great Affair, resting in a false Faith and pre∣sumptuous Hope.</P>
<P>AN Error here is fatal, and yet (alas) very com∣mon.</P>
<P>WE had need then apply our selves with the greatest Care and Solicitude to inquire into the Truth &amp; Grounds of our Hope, that we may not by a deceived Heart be turned aside from the path of Life, and finally perish with a Lie in our right hand.</P>
<P>Let it be Inquired then,</P>
<P>IS your Hope built on the Promise of GOD in Jesus Christ, and accompany'd with Qualifications and Deportments agreeable to the Terms of the Promise? Are you of the Number of those, Phil. 3.3. <HI>Which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh</HI>? Can you take up the Language of the Apostle, and from the Heart repeat his words in the following <HI>verses,</HI> <Q>I count all things but loss, for the excel∣lency of the knowlege of Christ Jesus my Lord; and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ; and be found in him, not having on mine own Righteousness, but that which is of Christ by Faith. I count not my self to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high Call∣ing of GOD in Christ Jesus.</Q></P>
<P>DO'S your Hope in Christ in flame your Desires and invigorate your Endeavors after Communion
<PB N="23" REF="002743_0024_0FE61FC7280FBCC0"/>
with him and Conformity to him? In fine —</P>
<P>HAS your Hope a purifying Influence upon you? The Apostle <HI>John</HI> lays down that infallible Character for us to try our selves by, — 1 Joh. 3.3. <HI>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth him∣self, even as God is pure.</HI> — Verily, if these be the Properties &amp; Fruits of your Hope, 'tis a <HI>good Hope,</HI> and shall stand the shock of Death, &amp; may well reconcile you to the Tho'ts of the Grave. It is a Hope built on sure and everlasting Foundations, strong in the LORD, and guarded with all the Forces of his strength. Wherefore it is said in the Scripture, <HI>He that believeth on Him, shall not be confounded.</HI> They shall not be ashamed, that wait for the LORD, and hope in his Mercy. Such may triumph with the Prophet, Isai. 50.7, 8. — <HI>The Lord God will help me; — I know I shall not be ashamed. He is near that justifyeth me: who will contend with me,</HI> &amp;c. — So you may glory with the Apostle, in like words, Rom. 8.33, &amp;c. <HI>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that justifyeth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died —. Who shall separate us from the Love of Christ? — Neither Death nor Life, nor Angels — nor any other Creature shall be able</HI> —. Verily, if you truly believe in CHRIST, your Hope is such an one as shall not be disappointed; shall not make you ashamed. Even Death shall not destroy it, but <HI>accomplish</HI> it. Your Flesh shall rest in Hope, and your Hope shall never perish; but be <HI>completed</HI> in everlasting Fru∣ition, swallow'd up in the Sight and Enjoyment of the Blessed GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002743_0025_0FE61FC72F52D670"/>GOD may seem to hide himself from you for the present, but he will never forsake you utterly. Isai. 45.15, &amp;c. <HI>Thou art a God that hidest thy self, O God of</HI> Israel <HI>the Saviour. They shall be ashamed, all of them, — that are makers of</HI> Idols. <HI>But</HI> Israel <HI>shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvati∣on: ye shall not be ashamed, nor confounded world with∣out end.</HI> You may be apt to condemn your selves, but GOD wou'd have you trust in him. Isai. 50.10. <HI>Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light? let him trust in the Name of the LORD, and stay upon his GOD.</HI> Finally, Men may vote you Reprobates, and pass the Doom of Hypocrites upon you: but says the same Prophet, Chap. 66.5. <HI>Hear the Word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my Name's sake, said Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</HI> AMEN!</P>
