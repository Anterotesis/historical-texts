<P>For I have espoused you to one Husband, that I may present you as a chaste Virgin to Christ.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE exceeding Riches of divine Grace in our blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, afford us matter for Wonder, Love and Admiration. That the Lord Jesus Christ should so wonderfully condescend, for our Salvation, as to be born of a poor Virgin, <HI>be made of a Woman, made under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the Law:</HI> that he should humble himself to all those ignominious Circumstances in which he lived and died; he <HI>humbled himself, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross,</HI> when, with infinite Ease, he could have spoken all his Persecutors into the very Deeps of Hell. This is wonderful. But what is still more astonishing, and speaks the Heights and Depths of infinite boundless Love, is that he should <HI>wed</HI> such vile Worms of the Dust, such polluted Monsters, who <HI>have played the Harlot with many Lovers,</HI> and take them into the Arms of his Love, yea into his Bosom, to all the Indearments of that wonderful Relation in the new and everlasting Covenant, in which Christ and Believers are one. That Christ should be a Hus∣band for Souls, a loving, kind and tender Husband, expressed in his GIVING HIMSELF for them: And that he should <HI>so give himself a Ransom</HI> for them, that he might purchase to himself a glorious Church <HI>without Spot or Wrinkle, or any such Thing,</HI> must appear to be infinite Love and Condescention. And this is the very Case; the Lord Jesus Christ seeks this in all he has done,
<PB N="6" REF="010146_0003_0F7D1CB1C310C270"/>
and is doing as Mediator. This is the End, the important End of the Gospel; and for this noble, glorious Purpose are the Ministers of it sent forth; and thus we read 2. Cor V. 20. <HI>Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you, in Christ's Stead, be ye reconciled unto God.</HI> And according to this, says the Apostle in the Text, <HI>I have espoused you to one Husband,</HI> i. e. I have been the Instrument of it. I have drawn up the Contract fairly before you, and have besought, and prayed you, in Christ's Stead, to be reconciled to God; and I persuade my self that I have been so happy as to be instrumental of bringing many of you into that blessed Marriage Covenant with Christ: And this was one great View I had in it <HI>that</HI> I might at last present you as a chaste Virgin to Christ, present you holy and pure, true and faith∣ful to him, according to the true Intent of the Covenant, to his Acceptance and Glory, and your Joy and Comfort.</P>
<P>Therefore was the holy Apostle <HI>Jealous over them with a godly Jealousy,</HI> i. e. he had a tender Fear and Concern for them, when their false Teachers were endeavouring to seduce and lead them a∣way from the Simplicity of the Gospel, and to undervalue him, although he had been the Instrument of their Conversion from Heathenism to Christianity, and had planted the Gospel among them with indefatigable Pains and Industry. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 18.3, 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> And indeed it must give every true and faithful Minister a very painful and affecting Concern to see the LORD's FLOCK carried away captive; and in Danger of being devoured with greedy Wolves: to see them that they have laboured to espouse to one Husband, Christ, snared and led away after other Lovers; for how shall they present such as a chaste Virgin to Christ.</P>
<P>That they may be the happy Instruments of Souls being espoused to Christ, and present them finally, to him, pure, holy and spot∣less is the great Design of their Office. For this they are Ambas∣sadors. And O how blessed to be succesful! How greatly to be desired?</P>
<P>Suffer me then to treat this noble and divine Subject under the following Propositions, viz.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="010146_0004_0F7D1CB2631844A8"/>I. As it is the great Design, so it should be the earnest Desire and Endeavour of the Ministers of Christ to espouse Souls to him, as to one Husband.</P>
<P N="2">II. Those Ministers who are made the happy Instruments of espousing Souls to Christ shall have the great Honor, the unspeaka∣ble Satisfaction, Joy and Comfort of presenting them as a chaste Virgin to him.</P>
<P>I return to the first Proposition.</P>
<P N="1">I. As it is the great Design, so it should be the earnest Desire and Endeavor of the Ministers of Christ to espouse Souls to him, as to one Husband.</P>
<P>Here I would, by divine Help, shew,</P>
<P N="1">1. What it is for Souls to be espoused to the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. That this is the great End and Design of the Gospel Mini∣stry. And therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. That it should be the earnest Desire and Endeavor of Mi∣nisters to espouse Souls to Christ.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to shew what it is for Souls to be espoused to the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>And this, surely, can be nothing less than <HI>to be united to him in the Covenant of Grace, by Faith.</HI></P>
<P>It has pleased God, in his infinite Love, to think upon our fallen guilty Race, who had broken the Covenant of Works, and brought themselves thereby, under it's severe and terrible, though infinitely righteous, Curse. When that holy Covenant could afford us no Help, but, on the contrary, doomed us to eternal Woes: the ve∣ry Moment we might expect the tremendous Displays of divine Justice, behold, the blessed Jesus appears in the precious Promise! God says Help upon one that is <HI>mighty to save, able to save all, even to the uttermost, that come unto God by him.</HI> God reveals his most gracious Covenant for his chosen People, in and through Christ, who <HI>is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by Means of Death, for the Redemption of the Transgressions that were under the first Testament, they which are called might receive the Promise of eter∣nal Inheritance</HI>▪ <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eo. 9 15.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010146_0005_0F7D1CB32BFD4E88"/>It is indeed very wonderful that ever the glorious JEHOVAH should take such a Method for our Salvation. That ever there should be such a Thing as an everlasting Covenant, between the Father and the Son, for our Redemption: that the eternal Son of God should be the Mediator of the new Covenant, the Covenant of Grace, in which all true Believers are united to Christ, by a divine Faith. By this most gracious Covenant are the Faithful saved from deserved Wrath, and <HI>raised up to sit together in heavenly Places in Christ Jesus,</HI> to his eternal Glory.</P>
<P>This is a Covenant that has it's Foundation all laid in Grace; for it is a Covenant of Mercy for Covenant Breakers; a Covenant of Grace for guilty, Hell deserving Creatures, for ever inca∣pable of helping themselves in any Measure at all. And O how great this salvation! God the Father lays the Foundation, and in the Fulness of Time gives his own only Son out of his Bosom; Christ comes, and lays down his Life, and purchases all the Bless∣ings of the Covenant: the holy Spirit is given to <HI>open our Eyes, and to turn us from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God; that we may receive Forgivness of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are sanctified by Faith that is in Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts 26.18.</NOTE> The poor Soul is taken most freely, out of his unregenerate State, <HI>in the Day of</HI> God's <HI>Power</HI>; cut off from the wild Olive, and graffed in∣to the true; planted in Christ; born from above, being begotten again to a lively Hope by the Resurrection from the Dead, and made a Partaker of the divine Nature.</P>
<P>To bring this to pass, God is pleased to write to us the great Things of his Law, and <HI>thunder</HI> forth the terrible Curses thereof from Mount Sinai. To set Home, upon the Conscience, the awful Truths of his holy Word, and awaken the secure Sinner by a Spirit of Conviction; to shew him his lost Estate, his guilty, filthy Circumstances; that he is justly deserving of the divine Displeasure, and going to Destruction, and unable to help himself.</P>
<P>It is true that God has appointed various Duties to be done; the Word, Sacraments and Prayer are the outward and ordinary Means by which Christ communicates to us the Benefits of Redemption.
<PB N="9" REF="010146_0006_0F7D1CB3E1D69900"/>
And these Duties are to be attended as proper Means of Grace, yet will never save a Soul, nor can they give Relief to one under such distressing Circumstances. No, <HI>without Faith it is impossible to please</HI> God, or to gain any true Comfort to the Soul. True God is pleased to order the Word of Faith, the blessed Gospel to be preached to them that are in such a Condition; so God has written to us the great Things of his Gospel, and <HI>to us is the Word of this Salvation sent.</HI> Christ was sent, and his Ministers are sent <HI>to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the Opening of the Prison to them that are bound</HI>; and not only so but also to call even to the Ends of the Earth to <HI>look</HI> unto Christ <HI>and be saved</HI>; to <HI>behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World.</HI> And hence we find the Apostles Paul and Silas, exhorting the trembling Jaylor <HI>to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and he should be saved.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 16.31.</NOTE> Never∣theless the Arm of the Lord must be <HI>revealed,</HI> or the Gospel <HI>Report</HI> will not be <HI>believed</HI> even by the convinced Sinner. In the Day of God's Power his stubborn Will shall be bowed, and the Word of the Gospel be made the effectual Means of his Conversion and Salvation. The Eyes of his Understanding are opened to a divine Discovery of the blessed Redeemer in his Mediatorial Fulness and Glory. To behold <HI>his Glory, the Glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of Grace and Truth</HI>; and <HI>of his Fulness to receive, and Grace for Grace.</HI> To receive him as the <HI>End of the Law for Righ∣teousness to every one that believeth</HI>: to cast his whole Soul upon him and rest upon him, as the only Propitiation for our Sins, and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole World. To ac∣quiesce, most heartily and freely, in the only Way of Salvation by him. To take him upon his own Terms, or Proposals of Agree¦ment, embrace him by Faith and Love, and cleave unto him with a cordial Affection, from a Sense of his infinite Worth and Excel∣lence, divine Amiableness and transcendant Beauty and Glory. Thus are Souls espoused unto Christ as to one Husband, joined unto him, and made one with him in the new Covenant, ordered in all Things, and sure: And these be they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. I proceed to shew,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="010146_0007_0F7D1CB4A9963D80"/>II. That it is the great End and design of the Gospel Ministry to espouse Souls to Christ.</P>
<P>Now if the Ministers of the blessed Jesus, are sent to preach the Gospel, to preach Christ Jesus the Lord, to preach Repentance to∣wards God, and Faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ, it must be the Design of their Ministry to bring Souls to espouse the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>It is not here to be supposed that it lies in their Power to bring Souls to espouse the Lord Jesus Christ, but that Christ does it by them, and they should desire and endeavour to be instrumental of it. The gospel Covenant is that only in which Souls are espoused to Christ. And it is this that Ministers are to preach; and they are to make Use of the Gospel Arguments and Motives for this great Purpose. To exhibit the sweet and powerful Invitations, Calls and Promises of it, that by these they may be sweetly <HI>compelled</HI> to come to the Marriage of the King's Son, and partake of the great Gospel Supper. Moreover, Ministers are Ambassadors of the blessed Jesus. So our Apostle, <HI>Now then, we are Ambassadors for Christ, as tho' God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's Stead, be ye recon∣ciled to God.</HI> Great and sovereign Princes sometimes send their Ambassadors into foreign Countries, to obtain, by Suit, a Bride for themselves. And the Lord Jesus does so likewise, he sends his Ministers to seek a Bride for himself; to invite and call Souls to a Marriage with him in the Covenant of Grace. Hence we find our blessed Saviour discoursing of the Kingdom of Heaven by Way of Similitude likning it to a certain King that made a Marriage for his Son, and sent forth his servants to invite and call Guests to the Wedding, Mat. 22.1, 10. We have the same Thing in Sub∣stance in Luke 14.16, 24. This, this is the great Thing they are sent upon to bring Souls to the Marriage, and must gather them even out of the Highways and Hedges, that our Lord's House may be filled. O then how should the Love of Christ constrain them! Methinks I hear the blessed Jesus saying, <HI>Simon Son of Jo∣nas, lovest thou me?—Feed my Sheep.—Feed my Lambs.</HI> O how much have Ministers to do to <HI>watch</HI> for Souls as they that must give Account? How should they watch every Opportunity to commend
<PB N="11" REF="010146_0008_0F7D1CB6CE39A1D0"/>
their glorious LORD in all his Beauty, transcendant Beauty, Glory and Excellency; and become all Things to all Men, that by all Means they may gain some to Christ?</P>
<P>Moreover, it is the great Thing that Christ's Heart is upon. Our dear Lord and Master has his Heart upon this as the great Thing in which his Glory as Mediator and Head of the Church consists. O how was his Heart upon it, in the Days of Eternity; when he was daily his Father's Delight, and was rejoicing always before him? Then he rejoiced in the habitable Part of his Earth, and his Delights were with the Sons of Men. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8.30, 31.</NOTE> And surely his Heart must be greatly upon it, when he came down, and taberna∣cled in Flesh, and dwelt among us. When he humbled himself in such an amazing Manner in his Birth, Life and Death for our Sakes. Submitted to all Ignominy and Sorrow: was a <HI>Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isa. 53, 3.</NOTE> He bore the Malice of wick∣ed Men and Devils; and suffered the Hidings of his Father's Face. <HI>Was stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted; was wounded for our Transgressions, and bruised for our Iniquities. The Chastisement of our Peace was laid vpon him, that by his Stripes we might be healed.</HI> And O how was his Heart upon espousing us to himself, when <HI>for the Joy that was set before him, he endured the Cross, despising the Shame</HI>; and was so <HI>straitned till it was accomplished?</HI></P>
<P>And when we consider him as an Intercessor, consider him in all his Offices; in all the indearing Characters in the blessed Gospel; and in all the Offers, Pains and Care of it in sending his Ambassa∣dors to preach <HI>Peace by Jesus Christ, and pray us in his Stead to be reconciled to God,</HI> must we not be constrained to say that his Heart was upon espousing Souls to himself; and of bringing many Sons and Daughters unto Glory? and if this be the Case, how evidently does it appear to be the great Work and Business of Ministers, the very End and Design of their Office to win Souls to Christ.</P>
<P>Furthermore, as it is absolutely impossible that even Souls should be saved any other Way, than, by a Mystical, and vital Union with the Lord Jesus Christ; so the very Business of his Ministers must be about it. Indeed there is no other Way of Salvation for
<PB N="12" REF="010146_0009_0F7D1CB79062EE58"/>
Sinners, but by the only Redeemer; and no other Way of being saved by him, but by Faith in him, which Faith is the very Act of the Soul whereby it receives him as both Lord and Christ, or, as he is represented and offered to us in the Gospel. And thus we become interested in his Merits. As the Bride becomes inte∣rested in her Husband's Estate and Priviledges by Marriage, so the believing Soul becomes, intrusted in the Righteousness and Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ by Marriage with him. Faith brings the Soul into a Union to Christ, and to a Participati∣on in his Estate, if I may so say, and thus it is that we are justified by Faith alone; and that <HI>by him, all that believe, are justified from all Things, from which they could not be justified, by the Law of Moses. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay; but by the Law of Faith.</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. 3.27.</NOTE> Therefore <HI>let him that glorieth, glory</HI> only <HI>in the Lord.</HI> And let Ministers be careful to preach Righteousness by Faith, without the Deads of the Law; yet be constant in affirming, that they which have believed in God be careful to maintain good Works; yea and that whosoever would find the Mercy of God, must seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.</P>
<P>I proceed to the third Thing proposed,</P>
<P N="3">3. To shew that it should be the earnest Desire and Endeavour of the Ministers of Christ, to espouse Souls to him. And if it is their Work and Business, and a Work of so great Importance, they ought to go about it with their Hearts engaged in it, with very ardent Desires that it might be accomplished, and should use their utmost Endeavours to promote it, that their great Masters Interest may be advanced. Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. It should be their <HI>earnest, fervent Desire.</HI> Ministers should not take the Oversight of the Flock of Christ by Constraint, but willingly; not for filthy Lucre, but with a ready Mind, ready to lay down their Lives in the glorious Cause, to lay down their Lives for the Brethren. The Love of Christ and Souls should constrain them; and not the Love of this vain, transitory World. O how should the Ministers of Christ <HI>travail in Birth</HI> for their dear People
<PB N="13" REF="010146_0010_0F7D1CB81D33D868"/>
with St. Paul, <HI>'till Christ be formed in them</HI>? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.19.</NOTE> Such should be their Desires, earnest, painful Desires for the Conversion of Sin∣ners to God, and very especially of those committed to their more immediate Care. If they are the Friends of the Bridegroom, (as indeed they should be) how greatly should they desire to have the Weeding furnished with Guests: And the King of Zion crowned in the Day of his Espousals, the Day of the Gladness of his Heart. Surely, not to desire it a above every worldly Advantage, above their Honor, or Ease, or any Thing secular, must be highly criminal in the Sight of God, who has sent them out upon such Business. <HI>Jerusalem's Peace</HI> should be preferred <HI>above their chief Joy.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 137.6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. They should <HI>earnestly endeavour</HI> to bring about the blessed Match between Christ and Souls.</P>
<P>What indefatigable Pains should the Ministers of the blessed Jesus take, to espouse Souls to him in the Gospel Covenant? Here let me say,</P>
<P>Much Pains should be taken in the Study, that beaten Oil may be brought into the Sanctuary. Wise Preachers will give <HI>good Heed, seek out, and set in Order</HI> their Discourses: they will <HI>seek to find out acceptable Words, even Words of Truth.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Eccles. 12.9, 10,</NOTE> They should <HI>give themselves to Reading, Meditation and Prayer.</HI> Ministers should be praying Men. <HI>We will give ourselves continually to Prayer, and to the Ministry of the Word,</HI> say the APOSTLES. And they should <HI>study to shew themselves approved unto God, Workmen that need not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2.15.</NOTE> O how great Need is there that Ministers should be furnished with a good Fund of Knowledge, both human and divine? They should search the Scriptures and other Writings with unwearied Attention and Dili∣gence. They should have good Learning, as well as true Grace; and labor to improve in their Studies, that their Profiting may ap∣pear unto all, while they bring forth out of their Treasures <HI>Things new and old.</HI></P>
<P>They should also labor most fervently in the <HI>Pulpit.</HI> When they come to stand before God and his People to Minister in holy
<PB N="14" REF="010146_0011_0F7D1CB8606C7210"/>
Things, with what Gravity and Decency, Solemnity and Reverence should they be clothed? What a holy Zeal and heavenly Fervor should they put on; and, in the Strength of the Lord declare all his Works, declare all the Council of God? And give to every one his Portion in due Season?</P>
<P>They should preach the Law, for by it is the Knowledge of Sin; by it are the careless and carnal, the vicious and profligate, and every unregenerate Sinner to be awakned, that they may flee from the Wrath to come. And they should preach the Gospel, sound the <HI>Jubilee</HI> Trumpet, proclaiming Liberty for the <HI>insolvant Debter,</HI> the poor miserable Bond Slave to go out free, and possess the rich Inheritance among the Saints in Light. And, O how earnest and fervent should they be in inviting and calling them that are bidden to the Wedding? yea, and how instant in Season and out of Season, taking every Opportunity, that, by all Means, they may gain some to Christ? And, O how sweet and joyful, to bring one Guest to the Wedding!</P>
<P>Again how faithful should they be in Administring the Seals of Gods gracious Covenant, to his visible People? And also in warn∣ing and admonishing the ignorant and scandalous; and in dispens∣ing the Discipline of Christ's House according to his Mind?</P>
<P>Again, what Pains and Endeavours should be used in <HI>visiting and catechising,</HI> and, in private, instructing and feeding the Flock of Christ? Surely their Conversation should be savory, and <HI>Admi∣nister Grace to the Hearers</HI>▪ And they should be <HI>examples to the Flock, in Word, in Conversation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. 4.12.</NOTE> <HI>In all Things shewing themselves Patterns of Good Works.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. 2.7.</NOTE></P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>How <HI>winning</HI> should Ministers be in their Preaching, Conversati∣on and Behaviour? How wise and prudent? How kind and ten∣der, courteous and affable, apt to teach, ever ready to advise and counsel; to remove Doubts and Difficulties, direct under Trials and Temptations? to strengrhen the weak, encourage the faint and timorous, comfort the sorrowful distressed Christian, and alarm the secure Sinner, as well as detect the close Hypocrite? And never
<PB N="15" REF="010146_0012_0F7D1CBC059C91B8"/>
should the Servant of the Lord rest easy while there is a Soul out of Christ. It should be his fervent Desire, and most diligent Endea∣vor to have all espoused to him; for, O how cutting the Thought to loose one Soul! Would to God that all might <HI>be saved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth</HI> as it is Jesus!</P>
<P>Thus having briefly spoken to the first Proposition, I proceed to the other, viz.</P>
<P N="2">II. Those Ministers who are made the happy Instruments of espousing Souls to Christ shall have the unspeakable Satisfaction, the great Honor, Joy and comfort of presenting them as a chast Virgin to him.</P>
<P>Indeed every true and faithfull Minister of Christ shall be glori∣ous in the Eyes of the LORD, tho' Israel be not gathered; and great shall be their Reward in Heaven. God will reward them, not so much according to their Success, as according to their Faith∣fulness. Yet, certainly <HI>they that be wise shall shine as the Brightness of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteousness, as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dan. 12.3.</NOTE> It is not only possible, but probable that they will have some additional Honors and Comforts, some Joys which may exceed; Joys in their spiritual Children, whom they have begotton through the Gospel. But here let me observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. That some Ministers have been, are, and doubtless will be, the happy Instruments of espousing Souls to Christ. God is pleased graciously to bless their Labors for the Conviction and Conversion of Sinners. It is not in them, let them labor ever so faithfully, but of God alone that sheweh Mercy. Paul himself may plant, and Apol∣los water in vain, except God giveth the Increase. Without the Father draws, no Man can come to Christ; for the carnal Mind is Enmity against God, the will set in Opposition against him. There must, therefore, be the Day of God's Power to bring the Sinner to a Gospel Submission. And that Christ's faithful Mini∣sters have good Ground to expect. A most wonderful Promise our dear Lord and Master has left for them, <HI>LO, I am with you al∣ways, even to the End of the</HI> World. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat. 28.20.</NOTE> And as God has been pleas∣ed to make such abundant Provision in the Gospel, and so many
<PB N="16" REF="010146_0013_0F7D1CBD334B9B68"/>
precious Promises of the Spirit to be poured forth, as Floods, and as Waters upon the dry Ground, we may well look for glorious Days of Reformation; and therefore that God will make some, at least, of his faithful Mininers happy Instruments of bringing ma∣ny Sons and Daughters unto Glory.</P>
<P>It is so commonly, if not always, that where Christ sends his Ministers, he has chosen Vessels to be called in, and brought Home to himself: and wherever it is so, he will undoubtedly bless their Labors for gathering in his Harvest. It has pleased God, <HI>by the Foolishness of preaching</HI> (tho' not by foolish Preaching) <HI>to save them that believe.</HI> He is indeed all in all, and the Instrument nothing but an Instrument, and no more of an Instrument than he is pleas∣ed to make it: but blessed be his Name, he is many times pleased to make his Ministers wonderful Instruments of a glorious Reforma∣tion. What Wonders were done by the preaching of the Apostles and Ministers, in the first Ages of Christianity? And what great Things have been done many times since, when the Gospel has been preached in it's Power and Purity? What was done by the Instrumentality of Luther, Calvin and others about 250 years ago. A Reformation which has not been lost to this Day. And how has God succeeded the Labors of some of his Ministers in our Day, for the building up of his Kingdom and Interest among us? True, we have great Reason to mourn many sorrowful Things, as the Prevalence of Errors and Divisions, and the awful Profanity and Wickedness of Multitudes in the Land; and that after, yea in the Midst of great Judgments and Mercies, Nevertheless there are a goodly Number, who evidence, by their Virgin Purity and Chasti∣ty, that they are espoused to one Husband, even Christ.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Such ministers of Christ as are instrumental of espousing Souls to him <HI>shall present them to him as a chaste Virgin.</HI></P>
<P>Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. I would speak of the Time when they shall present them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Shew <HI>how</HI> they shall present them to Christ</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to speak of the Time when the faithful Ministers of Christ shall present believing Souls to him.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010146_0014_0F7D1CBDD1BD4668"/>And it may be said that they are presenting them in their daily Prayers, and in the Administration of the holy Ordinances of the Gospel. But then, the Time referred to is very likely the great and last Day, the Day of Judgment. Then shall they come, and appear before their LORD and Master to give Account of their Stewardship, and then shall they say, <HI>Here Lord am I, and the Children which thou hast given me.</HI> I have delivered to them thy Word; And thro' thy Grace, they have received it, believed in thy Name, and obeyed thy Will. They have kept thy Word. And now LORD, let them be glorified with thee according to thy most gracious Promise. This will undoubtedly be the Time, when, in a very especial Manner, they shall present them before the LORD JESUS CHRIST; and then shall they be led in to the King in Raiment of Needle Work, in the pure and fine Linen which is the Righteousness of Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. I am to shew How the Ministers of Christ shall present those whom they have espoused to him, and that is <HI>as a chaste Virgin.</HI> So they shall present them <HI>pure and holy</HI>; for they shall be perfectly holy, being made free from all Sin: yea, they shall be really and positively holy, being washed, justified and sanctified in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God. The holy Image of the blessed God is in stamped, and compleated upon them; and they are transformed by the renewing of their Minds by the Holy Ghost. And how great is this Purity and Holiness? 'Tis the Price of Christ's Blood, and the Labor and Operation of the blessed Spirit, who creates the Soul anew, and forms it after the divine Image, <HI>in Knowledge, Righteousness and true Holiness.</HI> Not only are they <HI>Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> but their whole Nature and Temper is divine and heavenly. All the Graces of the Spirit are grown up to Perfection, and Sanctification is compleated; so there is no Alloy, no Remainders of Corruption, but a perfect Soundness in every Part.</P>
<P>They shall also present them <HI>free and intire</HI> Believers espoused to Christ, are espoused to him <HI>only,</HI> being divorced from all other former Lords, who had Dominion over them. They were once as base, vile Harlots, with their Affections set upon many Lovers;
<PB N="18" REF="010146_0015_0F7D1CBE7B6B1EE0"/>
but the Wonders of divine Grace have made them as a chaste Vir∣gin, spotless, innocent, pure and clean. They are married to Christ, and kept pure and intire: they are brought to be wholly for Christ, and for no other. Their Love is pure Virgin Love, undivided sound and unblemished. And they are now, pre∣sented to Christ, <HI>without Spot or Wrinkle, or any such Thing.</HI> These are the wise Virgins, who shall go with the Bridegroom, when he shall come, into the Marriage Chamber, and be for ever with the LORD. Such shall the Ministers of Christ present unto him, and in such a Condition shall they present them at that great Day. Suffer me once more to observe,</P>
<P N="3">3. With what great Satisfaction the Ministers of Christ shall pre∣sent these chaste Virgins to him. The APOSTLE speaks, in our Text, as if it was his great Desire that he might so present the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Church to Christ. He was therefore, jealous over them with a godly Jealously, least he should be disappointed of presenting them in this Manner. And surely, if it was a Matter of no great Importance; if it would be no great Satisfaction, Joy or Comfort to him, he would not be so concerned about it. We must there∣fore conclude that the true and faithful Ministers of Christ, will have abundant Satisfaction, when they come before their LORD and Master, with a <HI>Here</HI> LORD <HI>am I, and the Children which thou hast graciously given thy Servant.</HI> They must have great Satisfaction, Joy and Comfort in the Glory and Honor of their dear and blessed LORD, in so many Seals of their Ministry; so many joined to him in the Covenant of Grace, espoused to him, as a chaste Virgin to one Husband. They must have their Joy fulfilled, when they be∣hold them received into the Presence of their glorious LORD, <HI>to behold his Glory,</HI> and partake of the Blessings of the Marriage Feast. And will it be no Honor, Joy or Comfort, to have so many Stars in their Crown? Verily, <HI>they are their Joy and Crown,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. 4.1.</NOTE> especially <HI>in the Day of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>How blessed will the true Ministers of Jesus Christ be at that great Day, who will then have not only their own Salvation to re∣joice in, but the Salvation of so many precious Souls, thro' their
<PB N="19" REF="010146_0016_0F7D1CBF3427B710"/>
Instrumentality? And now to look back upon all their Labors and Sufferings in the glorious Cause of the blessed Jesus; and all the Dangers and Difficulties through which they, by the Help of di∣vine Grace, have led the Flock of Christ, must be refreshing and comforting. And if any shall have an Additional Happiness they will: If any shall have a larger and weightier Crown of Life and Glory such Ministers will have. And then he that sow∣ed, and they that reap, shall rejoice together. And as a Father has a peculiar Joy in his Children, so these Fathers in Christ will have a peculiar and special Joy in their spiritual Children. And very likely good Ministers of Christ, will have something special to do, in leading, and assisting the Church of God, in Heaven, to all Eternity; may go before in the heavenly Worship and Services. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The four Beasts, or rather the four living Creatures in the Rev. IV. supposed to intend, or to be Representatives of, the Ministers of Christ, are represented V. 6. as <HI>full of Eyes before and behind</HI>; and in V. 8. <HI>full of Eyes within,</HI> which may denote their exquisite Knowledge and Discerning in divine Things; that they look, not only within, to themselves and for themselves, but <HI>before and behind</HI> them, even to all that are about them. And V. 9, 10. We read that <HI>when those</HI> living Creatures <HI>give Glory and Honor, and Thanks to him that sat on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever, the Four and Twenty Elders,</HI> which are supposed to represent the Church, <HI>fall down before him that sat upon the Throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever,</HI> &amp;c. Thus <HI>the four living Creatures,</HI> the Ministers of the Gospel, lead the <HI>Four and Twenty Elders,</HI> the Church, in the heavenly Worship.</NOTE> Indeed, we, poor short sighted Creatures can know, in this our imperfect State, but very little of those Things: God has reserved the Discovery of them, chiefly for that blessed Period before us; but doubtless the Satisfaction of the Friends of the Bridegroom, at that Day, will be great, and their Joy will be full, to see the Spouse of Christ brought Home, thro' so many Tribulations; and led in to the King, who <HI>will wipe away all Tears from her Eyes, and lead her to living Fountains of Water.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Is there such a Thing as a Marriage Union of precious Souls, Sinners of Adam's Race, with the LORD JESUS CHRIST?</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence What abundant Reason have we for Wonder, Admi∣ration
<PB N="20" REF="010146_0017_0F7D1CC0697B27E8"/>
and Praise? That the LORD JESUS CHRIT, the eternal Son of God, should take such as we are, even his worst Ene∣mies, into so near a Relation to himself, is amazing Grace, marvel∣lous Love, Love beyond all Expression, and Condescention, with∣out a Parallel. For the greatest King in the World to marry the poorest Virgin in his Empire, is no Condescention, compared with this. For the highest sovereign Monarch among the Kings of the Earth, to stoop to marry the vilest Harlot among his worst Enemies, his open, and avowed Enemies, would look like Conde∣scention, and may be some faint Shadow of this; but really there would then be an infinite Disproportion; for it would be but one of his Fellow Worms; and their Natures are the same. But for the God of Nature, the Creator of the Universe, by whom all Things do consist, to veail his Divinity in Humanity, and freely submit to all those cruel Sufferings which our dear Redeemer did; and then take such vile Creatures, his worst Enemies, and the Bond Slaves of the Devil into his Bosom, is truly astonishing, and marvelous. Such his Grace finds them, but, how glorious is the Change at once made when they are brought Home to Christ in Regeneration and Conversion in Justification, Adoption and Sanctifi∣cation? They are then made Children and Heirs, <HI>Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Christ,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.17.</NOTE> to an Inheritance incorruptible, un∣defiled and that fadeth not away. Surely we may well cry <HI>Grace, Grace to it from the Bottom to the top Stone.</HI> And let his Name have endless Praise.</P>
<P N="2">2. What Honor and Dignity is conferred upon every true Be∣liever? That they should be brought into such a Union with the Prince of Life, such a Relation to the blessed God and only Saviour Jesus Christ, be joined to the Lord in an everlasting Covenant, be made one with Christ, taken so near to him, and <HI>raised up to sit to∣gether in heavenly Places in Christ Jesus.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. 2.6.</NOTE> <HI>To sit with him in his Throne, even as—he is set down with his Father in his Throne,</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rev. 3.21.</NOTE> how great the Honor and Dignity?</P>
<P>If the Christian had been set over all the World, or had been exalted to rule and command all the Angels in Heaven, it would
<PB N="21" REF="010146_0018_0F7D1CC0F715E5F0"/>
not have been equal to the Honor that he is now raised to in his Marriage with the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God over all blessed for ever. And is it not a great Honour to be made a Partaker of the divine Nature, and invested with all the Privileges of the Gos∣pel Covenant? These, these are Honors that are high and noble, and truly divine for which every Child of God should be thankful.</P>
<P N="3">3. We also see here the wonderful Love of God and Christ to his People. <HI>Behold,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>what Manner of Love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1. John, 3, 1.</NOTE> <HI>Here in,</HI> verily, <HI>is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Chap. 4.10.</NOTE> Herein is Love, that Christ, when we were his bitter Enemies, should die for us. His Love was stronger then Death.</P>
<P>And that he should take our defiled Souls, our guilty Persons into his Bosom; that he should make such rich and ample Provision for us, as if a common Place in Heaven was not good enough for us, when we most justly deserved the very Deeps of Hell, and the full Vials of the Wrath of God to be poured upon us for ever and ever▪ O the Height and Depth, the Length and Breadth of this unmeasurable Love! How full of Wonders, amazing Wonders!</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="4">4. How mysterious and wonderful the Way and Manner of a Sinner's Justification before God? That infinite Wisdom should pitch upon such a Method for the Glory of divine Justice and the Honor of the great Redeemer, that it must be brought about by our Espousals to Christ, when we were infinitely unworthy, and ill deserving. That we should be brought into such a Relation to the Lord Jesus Christ, and thereby become interested in his Riches and Righteousness, speaks the Wisdom of God, and the exceeding Riches of his Grace; and shews how he can be just, and, yet, the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. Let us admire and adore, wonder, love and praise.</P>
<P N="5">5. This also affords a most plentiful and free Invitation to poor, miserable and enslaved wretched Sinners, to come and join them∣selves to the Lord Jesus Christ, in an everlasting Covenant. And
<PB N="22" REF="010146_0019_0F7D1CC166373018"/>
O that they would be persuaded to come, and be bethrothed unto the Lord <HI>in Righteousness, and in Judgment, in Lovingkindness and in Mercies.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hos. 2.19.</NOTE> If any thing can be alluring and inviting this must be. Indeed there is every suitable and proper Motive to induce Souls to come and be saved: Yet nothing will avail, till the LORD shall, in the Day of his Power, open their Eyes and turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God. LORD, what is Man! But,</P>
<P N="2">II. Is it the great End and Design of the gospel Ministry, to espouse Souls to Christ? Hence,</P>
<P N="1">1. How deeply concerned should Ministers be to prosecute that great and good Design? Surely with Aaron they should bear the People upon their Hearts <HI>before the Lord continually</HI>; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Exod. 28.30.</NOTE> and wrestle and plead for the Blessing. They should labor with the greatest Assiduity with every one under their Care, and with others as they shall have convenient Opportunity, to bring them to comply with the Gospel Call, and Invitation, and come to the Marriage of the King's Son.</P>
<P N="2">2. How great a Blessing is the Gospel Ministry? if such be the noble and glorious Designs there of as the espousing of Souls to the blessed Jesus, and preparing a Bride to be presented faultless and blameless before the Presence of his Glory at last, it must be a great and rich Mercy to enjoy the Gospel Ministry. O how wonderfully are many favored with Ascension Gifts, and yet how insensible of the Mercy of God therein! Even some of the most faithful Mini∣sters of Christ are illy treated, and their Counsel despised and rejected by those whom they would fain espouse to the blessed Jesus. But let such know that the Time is coming when they shall know that there has been a Prophet among them. It will be very terrible by and by for such as receive not the Testimony of the Gospel Mini∣sters. Christ will take all that is said and done against them, as said and done against himself. Therefore let People beware how they conduct towards Christ's Ministers, and see that they esteem highly of their Office, and be very thankful for them. They should esteem them great Blessings, and the richest Treasures they
<PB N="23" REF="010146_0020_0F7D1CC263FAA1E0"/>
possess, next to spiritual Blessings. And they should be much in Prayer for them, love and honor them as their Lord's Ambassadors: hearken to the Word they preach in the Name of the Lord, and the private Counsels and Instructions they give them, and do as the noble <HI>Bereans,</HI> search the Scriptures and see whether they speak according to that unerring Rule, or not.</P>
<P N="3">III. Should it be the earnest, fervent Desire and Endeavor of Christ's Ministers to espouse Souls to him? Hence,</P>
<P N="1">1. Ministers should be holy and good Men.</P>
<P>If such be their Work and Business, and they are to go forward in it with fervent and earnest, hearty Desires for the Glory of God in the Salvation of Souls, they had need to be godly and gracious, holy and righteous Men: For what Desires can a wicked Man have for the Glory of God, the Interest of the great Redeemer and the Good of precious Souls? True, he may have many Desires from selfish Views, or Ends. But will such an one <HI>travail in Birth</HI> like the Apostle, <HI>till Christ be formed in his People?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.19.</NOTE> Will he wrestle and plead as Jacob and Moses till he obtains the Blessing? Can he out of Love to Christ, with Peter, feed Christ's Sheep and Lambs? Rather will he not regard the Fleece more than the Flock? And instead of preaching Christ Jesus the LORD, will he not preach himself? O how great Danger, that while the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the Ditch? Indeed such an one may preach good Truths, and even to Edification, but all the while he is a Stranger to those Truths and knows them not in their Spirituality and Glory. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Ministers greatly need the Presence of Christ, and the Assis∣tances of his Spirit with them. If, as we have heard, such is to be their Labor, and Endeavour for the Conversion and Salvation of Sinners, they really need the Presence of Jesus Christ with them, even his promised Presence; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. 28.30.</NOTE> and the Holy Ghost quickning, in∣lightning, sanctifying and comforting them. This will wonderful∣ly strengthen and help him in his great and difficult Work. How will his Soul be full of heavenly Matter, and his <HI>Tongue</HI> as <HI>the Pen of a ready Writer,</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Psal. 15.6.</NOTE> and the holy Fire of Love and Zeal, burn
<PB N="24" REF="010146_0021_0F7D1CC2E22D5420"/>
<HI>Seraph</HI> like in the Presence of the eternal Jehovah? Then will he <HI>be strong in Grace that is in Christ Jesus</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2, 1.</NOTE> and with heroic Courage and Fortitude engage in the Work of the Lord his God, and plead his Cause against the mighty. He will labor, and not faint; and im∣prove all his Time and Talents for the Interest of the great Re∣deemer, and the Good of Souls. Therefore, what Reason have they to be humbled to the Dust, and mourn the Want of the di∣vine Presence? And how earnestly should they seek it; and not allow themselves to live easy and contented without it? For Mini∣sters to be cold and dead, lifeless and slothful is a greater Sin than for a private Christian, a more heinous Sin against their Lord and Master, and a great Injury to the Interest of Souls. O that our Hearts and Lips were ever <HI>touched</HI> as <HI>with a live Coal from the Altar.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">6 Isa. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. How few Ministers do their Duty as they ought? How great Reason have they to be humbled, and ashamed before the Lord, and cry with the Prophet <HI>My Leanness, my Leanness</HI>! And how should they look to the great Atonement for themselves as well as the People! Blessed be God, there is enough in our great High-Priest for the Priesthood, as well as the Congregation. Were it not so, we could not hold up our Faces before the LORD. Here is our Refuge. But O let us, who are Ministers, bewail our Bar∣renness and Unprofitableness, look over our Ministry, and view our short comings, which may be seen in every Part of our Ministry; and let us fly to the Blood of the Covenant with an <HI>O God deliver me from Blood Guiltiness.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 51.14.</NOTE> And would to God that we, and every Minister, might be more concerned to be found faithful! A very sad Account the unfaithful Minister will have to give up at last. And instead of a goodly Number of precious Souls, espoused, through his Instrumentality, <HI>to one Husband, to present, as a chaste Virgin to Christ,</HI> he stands with a ghastly Number, whose Blood is required at his Hands. Tremble, my Soul, at the awful Thought! Blow the Trumpet in Zion, and warn the wicked of his Ways!</P>
<P N="4">IV. Shall those Ministers who are instrumental of espousing Souls to Christ, finally have the unspeakable Joy and Satisfaction of pre∣senting
<PB N="25" REF="010146_0022_0F7D1CC3A991E050"/>
them, at last, unto him? How should this <HI>animate</HI> and <HI>sup∣port</HI> every Minister in his great and difficult Work?</P>
<P>Ministers have a very great and difficulty Work, a weighty Work that lies heavy upon their Souls. A very great and difficult Thing it is to bring Souls to espouse the Lord Jesus Christ. Many make light of the Invitation, and will not come to the Wedding. Ministers have various Tempers and Constitutions to deal with; a Flood of Errors and Corruptions to withstand, and guard against: Temptations to remove by all possible proper Means. Hard Hearts, stupied Consciences; worldly, carnal, loose, profane and profligate Sinners to deal with; and what not? for the Children of apostate <HI>Adam</HI> have run into thousands of Disorders, and wild Mazes of Sin and Error, out of which they must be brought, or they will inevi∣tably perish. And there is a Legion, yea Legions of Devils, ever in busy Employ to prevent the Success of the Gospel. Besides, the good Minister has a bad Heart of his own to grapple with, which renders his Work the more difficult. And how many more Dif∣ficulties has every true Minister of Jesus Christ? How many Dis∣courgements, and Heart-breaking Considerations? yet, blessed be God, he has an over ballance for them all. In due Time he shall reap if he faint not. <HI>He that goeth forth, and weepeth, bearing pre∣cious Seed, shall doubtless come again with Rejoicing, bringing his Sheaves with him</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 126, 6,</NOTE>. The thought of winning Souls to Christ, and of presenting them at last, as a chaste Virgin to him, affords a won∣derful Support and Comfort under every Discouragement. To be the happy Instrument of the Conversion of one Soul is a great Thing: to be the Instrument of Good to one of the least of all Christ's Houshold, is a Matter of so much Importance, that a Mini∣ster's Labor cannot be said to be in vain; no, but eternal Honor will redound to God, and Good to that Soul, yea, and a glorious Reward too to the good Minister himself. Let them therefore, be animated in their Work, and take Comfort in it. It is a good Work; a glorious Work; the Work of the Lord. Let them labor and not faint; press forward, and <HI>look to Jesus</HI> their Lord and Mas∣ter, <HI>Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.2.</NOTE>, and <HI>endure as seeing
<PB N="26" REF="010146_0023_0F7D1CC461CE01C8"/>
him that is invisible,</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Chap. 11.27.</NOTE> knowing that <HI>great is their Reward</HI> from their Father which is <HI>in Heaven</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat. 5.12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And now as I am going to take the Care of one of Christ's little Flocks in the Wilderness, what shall I say to myself upon so solemn an Occasion? Sensible, in some Measure of my great Insufficiency <HI>for these Things,</HI> I would humbly bow my Neck to Christ's Yoke, depending upon his abundant Grace to be sufficient for me in the great and important Work; and would engage to persevere in it, by his Help, <HI>without which,</HI> I see, <HI>I can do Nothing.</HI></P>
<P>In my early Days I freely gave up myself to the blessed Jesus, with a fervent Desire to serve him in the Work of the glorious Gospel. The ardent Desire of espousing Souls to Christ, was the prevailing Motive with me, to devote myself to study under many Disadvantages, and caused me to persevere until I entered upon the Work. And blessed be God who has in any Measure, owned my worthless Endeavours for the good of Souls.</P>
<P>Indeed it has pleased a holy, righteous and sovereign God, in his all wise and all governing Providence to call me to leave that dear People in <HI>Norwich,</HI> to which I lately stood in the pastoral Relation, to the great Grief of us both. Yet thro' Grace, I esteem <HI>this</HI> with all my Sorrows but my <HI>light Afflictions,</HI> and <HI>not worthy to be com∣pared with the Glory to be revealed.</HI></P>
<P>And as I am now called to leave my Friends, to go a considerable Distance into the Wilderness, to an infant Plantation, where the Gospel is so greatly needed, I chearfully comply, hoping in God's own Time, to see the Wilderness and the Desart to rejoice, and blossom as the Rose, so that <HI>the Glory of Lebanon, the Excellency of Carmel and Sharon shall be given to it▪ that they shall see the Glory of the Lord, and the Excellency of our God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 35, 1, 2. See the rest of the Chapter.</NOTE>. If thro' the abundant Grace of God, I may be the happy, tho' unworthy Instrument of espousing Souls to Christ, and may at last, present them as a chaste Virgin to him, it will be the Sum of all my Desires. To this End I earnestly ask an Interest in all your Prayers, and humbly commend myself to the Grace of God in Christ Jesus my Lord.</P>
<P>And now my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, may I, your most
<PB N="27" REF="010146_0024_0F7D1CC5E4A9AA78"/>
unworthy Brother <HI>in the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus Christ</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">Rev. 1.9.</NOTE>, be suffered humbly to bespeak your tender Care and Concern for the Spouse of our royal and worthy Lord and Master Jesus Christ. O that it might be our Study, Prayer and Labor to espouse Souls, precious and immortal Souls to Christ. Can we be easy to live, to preach, to pray or Converse to no such blessed Effects? Should we not <HI>travail in Birth again</HI> for our dear People, <HI>till</HI> Christ be formed in them? O to see the Kingdom of our dear Lord advanced, Re∣ligion flourishing, the Land, Emmanuel's Land, a Mountain of Holiness and a dwelling Place of Peace, and Truth, and Righteous∣ness; and the Beauty of the Lord upon his People, how fervently to be desired! Let us think no Pains too great, no Labor too hard to win Souls to Christ. Let us lye at the Throne of Grace and take no Denial there, and lye upon our People, and take no Denial of them. <HI>For Zion's Sake,</HI> let us <HI>not hold our Peace, and for Jerusa∣lem's Sake</HI> let us <HI>not rest, until the Righteousness thereof go forth as Brightness, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isa. 62.1.</NOTE>. And let us think often of the <HI>presenting</HI> Time, which is at Hand; and God of his infinite Mercy grant that we may present a glorious Number as a chaste Virgin to Christ, and meet a <HI>Well done, good and faithful Servants, enter into the Joy of your</HI> LORD. Once more,</P>
<P>Let me address this numerous Congregation in the Name of the Royal Bridegroom, and invite you all to come and be espoused un∣to this one Husband. I beseech you in the Bowels of Christ, by all his Worth and Excellency, and by all the Blessings and Comforts of his Love, and by the Dreadfulness of his Wrath, that ye delay not the Matter, but come to a present Resolve for Christ. As ever ye would be presented faultless and blameless before the Presence of his Glory with exceeding Joy, and <HI>inherit the Kingdom prepared for the royal Bride from the Foundation of the World,</HI> now consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace. And the Lord be with you, AMEN.</P>
