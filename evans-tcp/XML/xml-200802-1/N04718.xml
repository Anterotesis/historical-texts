<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING had the Opportunity of perusing the following Dis∣courses, I do with pleasure re∣commend them to the World, as found, seasonable, and solid Composures. They appear to me to contain, the <HI>Words of Truth and Soberness;</HI> and to be well adapted to <HI>correct the Errors</HI> of the present Day, as well as to <HI>promote</HI> vital and practical <HI>Godliness.</HI>—The Obser∣vations in them are pious, pertinent, and instructive; and so well suited to the Times we live in, that they are like <HI>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Sil∣ver.</HI> The Stile is easy and natural,
<PB N="iv" REF="005885_0003_10275F59EAD1CAC0"/>
and the practical Inferences, affectionate and poignant, equally fitted to alarm Sinners, and comfort the Saints of God amidst the various Miseries that attend their present <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> thro' this Val∣ley of <HI>Tears,</HI> this uncertain and diffi∣cult State of Probation. In a Word, I am humbly of Opinion, that the Dis∣courses aforesaid, are grave and mas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uline; that they indicate a sober, hum∣ble, well-informed Mind, and a warm Heart. I therefore earnestly beseech the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to bless them to those noble Ends for which they are specially adapted, for the Sake of his dear Son!</P>
<P>Upon hearing the Reverend Author of the aforesaid Discourses, preach fre∣quently in this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity,</HI> particularly in his last Visit, and after frequent Conver∣sation with him in private, I find, to my <HI>great</HI> Satisfaction, that he is clear and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in the great Doctrines of Religion, and preaches exactly agree∣able
<PB N="v" REF="005885_0004_10275F5B72FCCF88"/>
to the <HI>Doctrinal Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and our <HI>Westmin∣ster Confession of Faith,</HI> between which there is the sweetest Harmony.—</P>
<P>It was likewise peculiarly agreeable to me, to hear the aforesaid Gentle∣man openly and boldly declare in his publick Discourses, against that detest∣able and dangerous Error of the <HI>Anti∣nomians,</HI> viz. <HI>That Persons are actual∣ly justified before Faith;</HI> which is the <HI>proton pseudos,</HI> or first Rise of all their Abominations.—</P>
<P>And I think it my Duty, having this Opportunity, to inform the Pub∣lick, that the Author of the following Discourses, has declared <HI>his Sentiments</HI> in this City, against that perilous <HI>ignis fatuus, Enthusiasm,</HI> (particularly in his last agreeable Visit) with equal Zeal; the Quintessence of which, as I con∣ceive, consists in following <HI>Impulses,</HI> or our own <HI>Fancy,</HI> as a Rule of Con∣duct, without the written Word, while
<PB N="vi" REF="005885_0005_10275F5E57E93358"/>
the sober Use of <HI>Reason</HI> is rejected; This, the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD has expresly opposed and declar'd a∣gainst.—There are some Things in this faithful Servant of Christ, which I cannot but admire as very uncom∣mon, <HI>viz.</HI> His continued <HI>burning Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of Christ for so many Years, with but little Interruption comparatively: His <HI>indefatigable La∣bours</HI> for God, especially in preaching the everlasting Gospel daily, for so long a Space of Time: The <HI>Preservation</HI> of his <HI>weak Constitution,</HI> from being entirely <HI>ruin'd</HI> by such an extraordina∣ry Course of vehement <HI>Labours</HI> and fatiguing <HI>Travel:</HI> The <HI>Preservation</HI> of his <HI>Soul,</HI> from being either quite lifted up, and carried away with <HI>Pride,</HI> in the midst of so much Popularity and Applause, or at times quite <HI>sunk</HI> in melancholly <HI>Despondency,</HI> under the <HI>Withdrawings</HI> of God's <HI>comfortable Presence,</HI> the <HI>Jealousies</HI> and Desertions
<PB N="vii" REF="005885_0006_10275F6415198CE0"/>
of dear <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Enemies,</HI> whereby his <HI>Character</HI> has been with Art and Elegance, exceedingly and unjustly blackened; tho'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by <HI>some,</HI> at least in all Probability, with an honest Inten∣tion: Add to these Sources of Grief, the Apostacies of divers promising <HI>Professors;</HI> some from the <HI>sound Doc∣trines</HI> of Religion, and some from Truth and practical Godliness both to∣gether; with the <HI>fiery Darts</HI> of <HI>Sa∣tan's Temptations,</HI> suited to the afore∣said Circumstances of Distress.</P>
<P>I may add to these, his extraordi∣nary <HI>Success</HI> in winning poor Sinners to the Lord Jesus Christ, and building up Saints in Knowledge, Faith, Holi∣ness, and Comfort!</P>
<P>Having had more Opportunities to know <HI>the Fruits</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Labours</HI> in the <HI>Gospel</HI>-Ministry than many others, be∣cause of my <HI>Travels</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> I can freely and safely declare, that I have met with many who have given a
<PB N="viii" REF="005885_0007_10275F6703FFD1A8"/>
rational and scriptural Account of their Conversion by <HI>his</HI> Ministry, and do crown their Narrative by a holy Prac∣tice. I heartily wish that some ingeni∣ous Gentlemen of Figure and Charac∣ter who have wrote against him, and have possibly been influenced thereto in a Measure, by a wrong Information respecting some Particulars in his Preaching and Conduct, had but the Opportunity of hearing him preach frequently, and pray, not only in Pub∣lick, but in private, as well as of free Conversation with him about the Things they object; I cannot but think that they would then alter their Senti∣ments concerning him. Surely their Jealousies would be removed, and their present apparent Aversion, turned into Wonder and Love. For my own Part, I must speak honourably of him, for God's Sake, and for Truth's Sake, should it cost me never so dear.—He comes out so clearly, so boldly and
<PB N="ix" REF="005885_0008_10275F688B366838"/>
prudently, for the sweet, sweet, sweet <HI>Truths</HI> of the <HI>ever-blessed</HI> LORD JESUS, that it charms my Heart into Admira∣tion and Love. If he doth not preach the Gospel of Christ, in my humble Opinion, it is not in the Bible. I be∣lieve in my Heart, and I think, with sufficient Reason, that his Designs in travelling are pious and honourable, <HI>viz.</HI> To bring poor Sinners to Christ, and to build them up in him. And he is for the general, uncommonly en∣livened and assisted in his blessed Ma∣ster's Service. He preaches the great Doctrines of the Reformed Churches, <HI>viz. Original Sin, Justification by Faith alone, Man's Impotency to do spi∣ritual Good, Regeneration, Sanctifica∣tion</HI> and <HI>Perseverance.</HI>—These impor∣tant Points he mainly insists upon, and that with Clearness, Pungency, and Pathos.</P>
<P>Moreover, he is <HI>meek</HI> and <HI>patient</HI> in <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and treats his Opposers
<PB N="x" REF="005885_0009_10275F6CC6698A60"/>
with Temper and <HI>Kindness.</HI>—In a Word, his whole Life evidently ap∣pears to be devoted to Jehovah, and is filled with Acts of Piety towards God, and Mercy towards Mens Souls and Bodies.</P>
<P>Yea, such is the Vehemence of his Desires to do extensive and manifold Service to the Church of God, that he is in Danger of losing his Life in the Cause, by a Series of extraordinary Labours (to all Appearance quite dis∣proportioned to his bodily Strength.) Now what greater Evidence can we have of the Sincerity of any Man than these? Especially if we add thereto, his peaceable, healing Disposition in respect of the Church of God, and op∣posing Schisms and Divisions. What tho' there have been some exception∣able, unguarded Expressions, in some of his former Writings? Is this to be wonder'd at, considering his <HI>young Years, strong Passions, Education</HI> in
<PB N="xi" REF="005885_0010_10275F6FA4A38058"/>
<HI>Arminian Principles,</HI> and the conti∣nued <HI>Hurry</HI> of his Labours in Preach∣ing, writing Letters, and Discoursing with People in the Places where he <HI>travell'd</HI> having withal but little Time for Study and Reflection?</P>
<P>Shou'd not that <HI>Charity, that hopes all Things</HI> that are good, as far as there is any Reason for it, induce us to put a favourable Construction on them, at least on his Designs; especially consi∣dering that his after Writings set many Things in a better Light?</P>
<P>If every doubtful Expression in the Writings of <HI>Luther,</HI> and many other good and great Men, were put upon the Rack by ingenious Pens, and not compared with other Passages in the same, or other of their Performances, their Principles would appear in a sable Dress, and might be easily burlesqued.</P>
<P>I design to offend no Man by this Preface—I desire to entertain charita∣ble Sentiments of all, as far as I have
<PB N="xii" REF="005885_0011_10275F770AB11750"/>
Scripture and Reason for it; and I doubt not, but divers who have opposed both the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD and my self, have had a pious and ho∣nest Intention in so doing.—I only beg leave to express my own Opinion, with all due Deference to such as are otherwise minded.</P>
<P>But I must hasten to the Conclusion, and therefore beseech the Reader to peruse, without Prejudice, the follow∣ing Discourses; and to consider seri∣ously the Truths contained in them, as well as to apply in particular his own Portion.—In this Way, he will glorify God, and probably receive spe∣cial Benefit to himself. I add no more, but imploring the Blessings of Heaven upon thy Endeavours, remain thy Ser∣vant for Christ's Sake.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALTHOUGH Believers by Nature are far from God, and Children of Wrath, even as others, yet it is a∣mazing to think how nigh they are brought to him again by the Blood of Jesus Christ—Eye hath not seen, or Ear heard, nei∣ther hath it entered into the Heart of any Man living fully to conceive, the Nearness and Dearness of that Relation, in which they stand to their common Head—He is not ashamed to call them <HI>Brethren—Behold,</HI> says the bles∣sed Jesus in the Days of his Fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, <HI>my Mother and my Brethren</HI>—And again after his Resur∣rection, <HI>Go tell my Brethren.</HI>—Nay sometimes he is pleased to term Believers his <HI>Friends—Henceforth call I you no longer Servants, but Friends—Our Friend</HI> Lazarus <HI>sleepeth</HI>—And
<PB N="2" REF="005885_0015_10275F830E64E7F0"/>
what is a Friend? Why "there is a Friend that is nearer than a Brother," nay, as near as one's <HI>own Soul</HI>—And <HI>thy Friend,</HI> says God in the Book of <HI>Deuteronomy, which is as thy own Soul.</HI>—Kind and endearing Appellations these, that undoubtedly bespeak a very near and in∣effably intimate Union between the Lord Je∣sus, and the true living Members to his my∣stical Body! But, methinks, the Words of our Text point out to us a Relation, which not only comprehends, but in respect to Near∣ness and Dearness, exceeds all other Relations whatsoever—I mean that of a <HI>Husband—For thy Maker is thy Husband—The Lord of Hosts is his Name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of</HI> Israel, <HI>the God of the whole Earth shall he be called.</HI>—</P>
<P>These Words were originally spoken to the People of the <HI>Jews,</HI> considered collectively as a peculiar People, whom our Lord had be∣troth'd and married to himself; and they seem to be spoken when Religion was upon the De∣cline among their Churches; when they had, in a great Measure, lost that Life and Power, which they once experienced; and their Ene∣mies began to insult them with a <HI>Where is now your God?</HI> Such a State of Things must un∣doubtedly be very afflicting to the true Mour∣ners in <HI>Zion;</HI> and, no doubt, put them upon crying unto the Lord, in this their deep Di∣stress—He hears their Prayer—His Bowels
<PB N="3" REF="005885_0016_10275F87848420C0"/>
yearn towards them; and, in the preceding Verse, he assures them, that tho' the Enemy had broken in upon them like a Flood, yet their Extremity should be his Opportunity to lift up a Standard against him—<HI>Fear not,</HI> says the great Head and King of his Church, <HI>for thou shalt not be ashamed,</HI> that is, <HI>finally</HI> or <HI>totally; neither be thou confounded, i. e.</HI> dissipated, or dejected, giving up all for gone, as though thou never shouldst see better Days, or ano∣ther Revival of Religion; <HI>for thou shalt not</HI> entirely <HI>be put to Shame,</HI> tho' for a while, for thy Humiliation, and the greater Confusi∣on of thy Adversaries, I suffer them to tri∣umph over thee: <HI>For,</HI> says the Lord, <HI>thou shalt forget the Shame of thy Youth, and shalt not remember the Reproach of thy Widow-hood any more; i. e.</HI> I will vouchsafe you such ano∣ther glorious Gale of my blessed Spirit, that you shall quite forget your former troubled Widow-state, and give your Enemies no more Occasion to insult you, on Account of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>nt-condition, but rather to envy you, and gnash their Teeth, and melt away at the Sight of your unthought-of Glory and Prosperity.—And why will the infinitely great and conde∣scending Jesus deal thus with his People? Be∣cause the Church is <HI>his Spouse—For,</HI> says he, in the Words just now read to you, <HI>thy Maker is thy Husband, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of</HI> Israel; and therefore he loves thee too
<PB N="4" REF="005885_0017_10275F8A6AB40D78"/>
well, to let thy Enemies always trample thee under Foot—<HI>The Lord of Hosts is his Name, the God of the whole Earth shall he be called;</HI> and therefore he is armed with sufficient Pow∣er to relieve his oppressed People, and over∣come and avenge himself of all their haughty and insulting Foes.—</P>
<P>This seems to be the prime and genuine Interpretation of the Text and Context, espe∣cially if we add, that they may have a further View to the latter-day Glory, and that blessed State of the Church, which the People of God have been looking for in all Ages, and the speedy Approach of which, we undoubt∣edly pray for, when we put up that Petition of our Lord's, <HI>viz. Thy Kingdom come.</HI>—</P>
<P>But, tho' the Words were originally spoken to the <HI>Jews,</HI> yet they are undoubtedly appli∣cable to all Believers in all Ages, and, when inlarged on in a proper Manner, will afford us suitable Matter of Discourse both for Sin∣ners and for Saints; for such as know God, as well as such who know him not; and likewise for those, who once walked in the Light of his blessed Countenance, but are now backslidden from him; have their Harps hung upon the Willows, and are afraid that their Beloved is gone, and will return to their Souls no more.—Accordingly, without prefacing this Discourse any farther, as I suppose a mix'd Multitude of Saints, unconverted Sinners, and
<PB N="5" REF="005885_0018_10275F8BF123BE10"/>
Backsliders, are present here this Day, I shall endeavour so to speak from the Words of the Text, that each may have a proper Portion, and none be sent empty away.—</P>
<P>In prosecuting this Design, I will

<ITEM>I. Endeavour to shew, what must pass be∣tween Jesus Christ and our Souls before we can say, <HI>that our Maker is our Husband.</HI>—</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The Duties of Love which they owe to our Lord, who stand in so near a Relation to him.—</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The miserable Condition of such as can∣not yet say, <HI>their Maker is their Husband.</HI>—</ITEM>
<ITEM>And IV. I shall conclude with a general Exhortation to all such unhappy Souls, to come and match with the dear Lord Jesus.—And Oh! may that God who blessed <HI>Abra∣ham'</HI>s Servant, when he went out to seek a Wife for his Son <HI>Isaac,</HI> bless me, even me also, now I am come, I trust, relying on divine Strength, to invite poor Sinners, and recal Backsliders to my Master Jesus!—</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> I am to shew, what must pass tween Jesus Christ and our Souls before we can say, <HI>Our Maker is our Husband.</HI></P>
<P>But, before I proceed to this, it may not be improper to observe, that if any of you, amongst whom I am now preaching the King∣dom of God, are Enemies to inward Religion,
<PB N="6" REF="005885_0019_10275F8D78596E28"/>
and explode the Doctrine of inward Feelings, as Enthusiasm, Cant and Nonsense, I shall not be surprized, if your Hearts rise against me whilst I am preaching, for I am about to dis∣course on true vital and internal Piety; and an inspired Apostle hath told us, <HI>that the na∣tural Man discerneth not the Things of the Spirit, because they are spiritually discerned.</HI>—But, however, be noble as the <HI>Bereans</HI> were; search the Scriptures as they did: lay aside Pre∣judice; hear like <HI>Nathaniel,</HI> with a true <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣elitish</HI> Ear; be willing to do the Will of God, and then you shall, according to the Promise of our dearest Lord, <HI>know of the Doctrine, who∣it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</HI>—</P>
<P>I would further observe, that if any here expect fine Preaching from me this Day, they will, in all probability, go away disappointed—For I came not here to shoot over Peoples Heads; but, if the Lord shall be pleased to bless me, to reach their Hearts. Accordingly I shall endeavour to cloath my Ideas in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plain Language, that the meanest Negro <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Servant, if God is pleased to give a hearin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ear, may understand me; for I am certain if the Poor and Unlearned can comprehen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, the Learned and Rich must.—</P>
<P>This being premised, proceed we to our first general Head, <HI>viz.</HI> To shew what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pass between Jesus Christ and our Souls, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fore we can say, <HI>our Maker is our Husband.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005885_0020_10275F95EF2BBEA0"/>
Now, that we may Discourse more perti∣nently and intelligibly upon this Point, it may not be amiss, under this Head, to consider, what is necessary to be done, before a Mar∣riage between two Parties amongst our selves, can be said to be valid in the Sight of God and Man—And that will lead us in a familiar Way, to shew, what must be done, or what must pass between us and Jesus Christ, before we can say, <HI>our Maker is our Husband.</HI>—</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> In all lawful Marriages, it is ab∣solutely necessary, that the Parties to be joined together in that holy and honourable Estate, are actually and legally freed from all Pre-en∣gagements whatsoever.—<HI>A Woman is bound to her Husband,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>so long as her Husband liveth.</HI> The same Law holds good in respect to the Man. And so likewise, if either Party be betrothed and promised, tho' not actually married to another, the Marriage is not lawful, till that Pre-engagement and Promise be fairly and mutually dissolved.—Now, it is just thus between us and the Lord Jesus—For, we are all by Nature born under, and wedded to the Law, as a Covenant of Works.—Hence it is, that we are so fond of, and artfully go about, in order to establish a Righteousness of our own—It is as natural for us to do this, as it is to breathe—Our first Pa∣rents, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> even after the Cove∣nant of Grace was revealed to them in that
<PB N="8" REF="005885_0021_10275F98D4599458"/>
Promise, <HI>the Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's Head,</HI> reached out their Hands, and would again have taken hold of the Tree of Life, which they had now forfeited, had not God drove them out of Paradise, and compell'd them, as it were, to be saved by Grace—And thus all their Descendants natu∣rally run to the Tree of Life, and want to be saved, partly at least, if not wholly, by their Works. And even gracious Souls, who are inwardly renewed, so far as the Old Man a∣bides in them, find a strong Propensity this way.—Hence it is, that natural Men are gene∣rally so fond of <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles.—<HI>Do and live,</HI> is the native Language of a proud, self∣righteous Heart.—But before we can say, <HI>our Maker is our Husband,</HI> we must be divorced from our old Husband, the Law; <HI>i. e.</HI> we must renounce our own Righteousness, our own Doings and Performances, in Point of Dependence, either in Whole or Part, as Dung and Dross, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord.—For thus speaks the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> Chap vii. 4. <HI>Ye also are become dead to the Law (i. e.</HI> as a Covenant of Works) <HI>by the Body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to him, who is raised from the Dead.</HI>—As he also speaketh in another Place, <HI>I have espoused you, as a chaste Virgin to Jesus Christ.</HI> This was the Apostle's own Case—
<PB N="9" REF="005885_0022_10275F9A6B0D8BA0"/>
Whilst he depended on his being <HI>a Hebrew of the Hebrews,</HI> and thought himself secure, because, as to the outward Observation of the Law, <HI>he was blameless;</HI> he was an entire Stranger to the divine Life: But when he be∣gan to experience the Power of Jesus Christ's Resurrection, we find him, in his Epistle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> absolutely renouncing all his external Priviledges, and all his <HI>Pharisaical</HI> Righteousness; <HI>Yea,</HI> says he, <HI>doubtless, and I count all Things but Loss, nay but Dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own Righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Jesus Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith.</HI> And thus it must be with us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'re we can say <HI>our Maker is our Husband.</HI>—Tho' we may not be wrought upon in that extraordinary Way in which the Apostle was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et we must be dead to the Law, we must be espoused as chaste Virgins, to Jesus Christ, and count all external Priviledges, and our most splendid Performances (as was before observed) only as Dung and Dross, <HI>for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But further, before a Marriage among us an stand good in Law, both Parties must not only be freed from all Pre-engagements, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere must be a mutual Consent on both Sides▪We are not used to marry People against
<PB N="10" REF="005885_0023_10275FA00505EF38"/>
their Wills.—This is what the <HI>Jews</HI> called Betr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thing, or Espousing, a Thing previous to the Solemnity of Marriage.—Thus we find, the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is said to be espoused to <HI>Jo∣seph,</HI> before they actually came together, <HI>Mat.</HI> i. 18. And thus it is among us—Both Parties are previously agreed, and as it were, espoused to each other, before we publish, what we call, the Banns of Marriage concerning them. And so it will be in the spiritual Marriage, between Jesus Christ and our Souls—Before we are actually married or united to him by Faith; or, to keep to the Terms of the Text, before we assuredly can say, that <HI>our Maker is our Husband,</HI> we must be made willing People in the Day of God's Power, we must be sweetly and effectually persuaded by the Holy Spirit of God, that the glorious <HI>Ema∣nuel</HI> is willing to accept of us, just as we are, and also that we are willing to accept of him upon his own Terms, yea, upon any Terms.—And when once it comes to this, the spiri∣tual Marriage goes on apace, and there is but one Thing lacking to make it compleat.—And what is that? An actual Union.</P>
<P>This is absolutely necessary in every lawful Marriage among Men.—There must be a Joining of Hands before Witnesses, e're they can be deemed lawfully joined together.—Some Men indeed of corrupt Minds, are apt to look upon this as a needless Ceremony
<PB N="11" REF="005885_0024_10275FA46F56E198"/>
and think it sufficient to be married, as they term it, in the Sight of God.—But whence Men get such Divinity, I know not.—I am positive, not from the Bible; for we there read that even at the first Marriage in Paradise, there was something of outward Solemnity; God himself (if I may so speak) being there the Priest.—For we are told, <HI>Gen.</HI> ii. 22. that, after God had made the Woman, <HI>be brought her unto the Man.</HI>—And indeed, to lay aside all Manner of outward Ceremony in Marriage, would be to turn the World into a Den of brute Beasts—Men would then take, or for∣sake, as many Wives as they pleased, and we should soon sink into as bad and brutal State, as those Nations are now in, amongst whom such Practices are allowed of, and who are ut∣terly destitute of the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.—Whoever has ex∣perienced the Power of his Resurrection, I am persuaded will never plead for such a licentious Practice—For the Terms made use of in Scrip∣ture, to represent he mystical Union between Christ and his Church, such as, our being <HI>joined to the Lord,</HI> and <HI>married to Jesus Christ,</HI> are all metaphorical Expressions, taken from some analagous Practices amongst Men.—And as Persons when married, tho' before twain, are now one Flesh; so those that are joined to the Lord, and can truly say, <HI>our Maker is our Husband,</HI> in the Apostle's Language, are
<PB N="12" REF="005885_0025_10275FA60FDA5598"/>
one Spirit.—This was typisied in the original Marriage of our first Parents.—When God brought <HI>Eve</HI> to <HI>Adam,</HI> he received her with Joy at his Hands, and said, <HI>this is Bone of my Bone, and Flesh of my Flesh.</HI>—They had there, primarily, but one Name—For thus speaks the sacred Historian, <HI>Gen.</HI> v. 1, 2.—<HI>In the Day that God created Man, he blessed them, and called</HI> their <HI>Name</HI> Adam.—And why? because they were <HI>one Flesh,</HI> and were to have but <HI>one Heart.</HI>—The self-same Terms are made use of in Scripture, to express the Be∣liever's Union with Jesus Christ—We are cal∣led <HI>Christians,</HI> after Christ's Name, because made Partakers of Christ's Nature.—Out of his Fulness, Believers receive Grace for Grace—And therefore, the marriage State, especially by the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> is frequently made use of, to figure out to us the real, vital Union, between Jesus Christ and regenerate Souls.—This is termed by the Apostle, <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 32. <HI>A great Mystery.</HI>—But great as it is, we must all experience it, before we can say assuredly, that <HI>our Maker is our Husband.</HI>—For what says our Lord, in that Prayer he put up to his Father before his bitter Passion? <HI>Father, I will that those whom thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast given me, shall be where I am, that they may be one with thee, even as thou, O Father, and I are one, I in them, and they in me, that we all may be made perfect in One.</HI>—Oh infinite Condescension!
<PB N="13" REF="005885_0026_10275FAAE0E88F80"/>
Oh ineffable Union! Hence it is, that Belie∣vers are said to be Members of his Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bones—Hence it is, that the Apostle, speaking of himself, says, <HI>I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</HI> What an Expression is <HI>that?</HI> How much does it com∣prehend? And, that we might not think this was something peculiar to himself, he puts this close Question to the <HI>Corinthians; Know ye not, that Christ is in you, unless you be Re∣probates?</HI> Agreeable to what he says in his Epistle to the <HI>Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssians, Christ in you, the Hope of Glory.</HI>—And hence it is, that our Church, in the Communion-office, directs the Minister to acquaint all those that receive the Sacrament worthily, that they are one with Christ, and Christ with them; that they dwell in Christ, and Christ in them—Words that deserve to be written in Letters of Gold, and which evidently shew, what our Reform∣ers believed all Persons must experience, be∣fore they could truly and assuredly say, that <HI>their Maker is their Husband.</HI>—</P>
<P>From what then has been delivered, may not the poorest and most illiterate Person here pre∣sent easily know, whether or not he is really <HI>married to Jesus Christ.</HI> Some indeed, I am a∣fraid, are so presumptuous as to affirm, at least to insinuate, that there is no such Thing as knowing, or being fully assured, whilst here below, whether we are in Christ or not—Or at least, if there be such a Thing, it is very
<PB N="14" REF="005885_0027_1026E4B741BEDE70"/>
rare, and only the Priviledge of the primitive Believers.—Part of this is true, and Part of this absolutely false.—That this glorious Priviledge of a full Assurance is very rare, is too, too true.—And so it is equally too true, that real Christians, comparatively speaking, are very rare also.—But that there is no such Thing, or that this was only the Priviledge of the first Followers of our blessed Lord, is direct∣ly opposite to the Word of God.—<HI>We know,</HI> says St. <HI>John,</HI> speaking of Believers in general, <HI>that we are his, by the Spirit which he hath given us;</HI> and, <HI>He that believeth hath the Witness in himself; Because you are Sons,</HI> saith St. <HI>Paul; God hath sent forth his Spirit into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Hearts,</HI> even the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, <HI>Abba Father</HI>—Not that I dare affirm, that there is no real Christian, but what has this full Assurance of Faith, and clearly knows, that <HI>His Maker is his Husband</HI>—In speaking thus, I should undoubtedly con∣demn some of the Generation of God's dear Children, who thro' the Prevalence of Unbe∣lief, indwelling Sin, spiritual Sloth, or it may be, for Want of being informed of the Privi∣ledges of Believers, may walk in Darkness, and see no Light—therefore, tho' I dare not af∣firm, that a full Assurance of Faith is absolutely necessary for the very Being, yet I dare assert, that it is absolutely necessary, for the Well∣being of a Christian—And for my own Part,
<PB N="15" REF="005885_0028_10275FADD5EAF640"/>
I cannot conceive, how any Persons, that pretend to Christianity, can rest satisfied or contented without it.—This is indeed stopping short, on this Side <HI>Jordan,</HI> with a Witness—And gives others too much Reason to suspect, that such Persons, however high their Profes∣sion may be, have, as yet, no true saving Grace at all.—Men, whose Hearts are set on this World's Goods, or, to use our Lord's Language, <HI>the Children of this World▪</HI> act not so—I suppose there is scarce a single Merchant in this great Congregation, especially in these troublous Times, that will venture out either his Ship or Cargo, without first ensuring both against the Violence of an Enemy, or a Storm—And I suppose there is scarce a single House, of any considerable Value, in any populous Town or City, but the Owner has taken out a Policy from the Fire-Office, to insure it, in Case of Fire—And can I be so irrational as to think, that there is such a Thing as securing my <HI>Goods,</HI> and my <HI>House,</HI> and that there is no such Thing as insuring, what is infinitely more valuable, my precious and immortal Soul? Or if there be such a Thing, as un∣doubtedly there is, what Foolishness of Fol∣ly must it needs be in Men, that pretend to be Men of Parts, of good Sense, and solid Reasoning, to be so anxious to secure their Ships against a Storm, their Houses against a Fire, and at the same Time, not be unspeakably

more solicitous, to take a Policy out of the Assurance-Office of Heaven; even the Seal and Witness of the blessed Spirit of God, to ensure their Souls against that Storm of divine Wrath; and that Vengeance of eternal Fire, which will at the last decisive Day come upon all those, that know not God, and have not obeyed his gracious Gospel? To affirm there∣fore, that there is no such Thing as knowing that <HI>Our Maker is our Husband;</HI> or that it is a Priviledge peculiar only to the first Christi∣ans, to speak in the mildest Terms, is both irrational and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>riptural. Not that all who can say, <HI>their Maker is their Husband,</HI> can give the same clear and distinct Account of the <HI>Time, Manner,</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> of their being spi∣ritually united and married by Faith to the blessed Bridegroom of the Church—Some there may be now, as well as formerly, sanc∣tified from the Womb—And others, in their Infancy and Non-age, as it were silently con∣verted—Such perhaps may say, with a little <HI>Scotch</HI> Maiden, now with God, when I ask∣ed her, whether Jesus Christ had taken away her old Heart, and given her a new One, <HI>Sir, It may be,</HI> said she, <HI>I cannot directly tell you the</HI> Time <HI>and</HI> Place, <HI>but this I know,</HI> it is done.—And indeed it is not so very material, tho' no Doubt it is very satisfactory, if we cannot relate all the minute and particular Circumstances, that attended our Conversion; if so be we are tru∣ly

Need I tell any married Persons in this Congregation, that they must go to the Uni∣versity, and learn the Languages, before they can tell whether they are married or not? Or, if their Marriage was to be doubted, could they not, think you, bring their Certificates, to certify the Time and Place of their Marriage; and the Minister that joined them together in that holy State? And if you are adult, and are indeed married to Jesus Christ, tho' you may be unlearned, and what the World terms illiterate Men, can not you tell me the Rise and Process, and Consummation of the spiritual Marriage, between Jesus Christ and your Souls?

Righteousness, Sanctification, and eternal Re∣demption—Whether <HI>Paul,</HI> or <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phas,</HI> or the World, or Life, or Death, or Things pre∣sent, or Things to come; all are yours.—All his Attributes are engaged for your Preserva∣tion, and all Things shall work together for your Good, who love God, and, by being thus married to the Lord Jesus, give an evi∣dent Proof that you are called according to his Purpose.—What say you?

For, tho' you are dead to the Law, as a Covenant of Works, yet you are alive to the Law as a Rule of Life, and are in, or under the Law (for either Expression seems to denote the same Thing) to your glorious Husband, Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>I say, <HI>Duties</HI> of <HI>Love</HI>—For being now mar∣ried to Jesus Christ, you work not <HI>for</HI> Life, but <HI>from</HI> Life.—The Love of God constrains you, so that, if there was no written Law, or,
<PB N="22" REF="005885_0035_10275FC6F079C270"/>
supposing Jesus wou'd set you at Liberty from his Yoak, so far as Grace prevails in your Hearts, you wou'd say, we love our blessed Bridegroom, and will not go from him.—</P>
<P>And now then, what does the Lord require of you? That we may speak on this Head, as plainly as may be, we shall pursue the Me∣thod we begun with; and, by carrying on the Allegory, and examining, what is required of truly Christian Wives, under the Gospel, in∣fer, what our Lord may justly demand of those, who are united to him by Faith, and can therefore say, <HI>our Maker is our Husband.</HI>—</P>
<P>And here let us go to the Law and to the Testimony.—What says the Scripture? <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ the Wife,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>see that she Reve∣rence her Husband.</HI>—It is, no doubt, the Duty of married Women, to think highly of their Husbands.—From whom may Husbands justly command Respect, if not from their Wives? The Apostle's Expression is Emphatical—Let the Wife <HI>see,</HI> that she reverence her Husband; thereby implying, that Women, some of them at least, are too prone to disrespect their Hus∣bands; as <HI>Michal, Saul's</HI> Daughter, despised <HI>David</HI> in her Heart, when she tauntingly said, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> vi. 20. <HI>How glorious was the King of Israel to Day, who uncovered himself to Day in the Eyes of the Hand-maids of his Servants, as one of the vain Fellows shamelesly uncovereth himself.</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="005885_0036_10275FC8C381ACB0"/>
This is a Source and Fountain, from whence many domestick Evils frequently flow.—Women should remember the Character Husbands sustain in Scripture.—They are to them, what Christ is to the Church.—And it is mentioned to the Honour of <HI>Sarah,</HI> that she called <HI>Abraham, Lord.—Shall I have a Child who am old, my Lord being old also?</HI> It is remarkable, that there are but two good Words in that whole Sentence, <HI>my Lord</HI> (for all the others are the Language of Unbelief) and yet those two Words the Holy Ghost men∣tions to her eternal Honour, and buries, as it were, the rest in Oblivion.—<HI>Even as Sarah,</HI> says St. <HI>Peter, obeyed Abraham, calling him</HI> Lord.—An evident Proof how pleasing it is in the Sight of God, for Women in the mar∣ried State, to reverence and respect their Hus∣bands.—Not that Husbands therefore should <HI>Lord it</HI> over their Wives, or require too much respect at their Hands—This wou'd be un∣christian, as well as ungenerous, indeed.—They ought rather, as God has taken such Care to keep up their Authority, commanding their Wives to reverence and respect them; they ought, I say, to be doubly careful, that they live so holy and unblameable, as to lay their Wives under no Temptation to despise them.—But to return from this Digression.—Does the Apostle say, <HI>Let the Wife see that she re∣verence her Husband?</HI>—May I not pertinently
<PB N="24" REF="005885_0037_10275FD10F007828"/>
apply this Caution to <HI>you,</HI> who are married to Jesus Christ? See to it, that you reverence and respect your Husband—I say, <HI>see to it▪</HI>—For the Devil will be often suggesting to you hard and mean Thoughts against your Husband.—It was thus he beset our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other <HI>Eve,</HI> even in a State of Innocence.—He wou'd fain per∣suade her to entertain hard Thoughts of her glorious Benefactor.—<HI>What,</HI> says he, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as God said, ye shall not eat of the Trees of the Gar∣den?</HI> Has he been so cruel to put you here in a beautiful Garden, only to vex and teize you? This he made use of as an Inlet to all his suc∣ceeding Insinuations—And this Trade he is still pursuing, and will be pursuing, 'till the very End of Time.—Besides, in the Eyes of the World, Jesus Christ has no Form or Comeliness, that they should desire him; and therefore, unless you <HI>watch and pray,</HI> you will be <HI>led into Temptation,</HI> and not keep up such high Thoughts of your blessed Jesus, as he justly deserves—In this you can never exceed.—Women, perhaps▪ n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y sometimes think too highly of, and, through Excess of Love, idolize their earthly Consorts.—But it is impossible for you to think too highly of your heavenly Husband, Jesus Christ.—</P>
<P>Further, what says the Apostle, in his E∣pistle to the <HI>Ephesians?</HI> speaking of the mar∣riage State, he says, <HI>The Wife is the Glory of her Husband;</HI> as tho' he had said, a Chri∣stian-Wife
<PB N="25" REF="005885_0038_10275FD295E0AD70"/>
shou'd so behave, and so walk, as to be a Credit to her Husband—As <HI>Abigail</HI> was an Honour to <HI>Nabal,</HI> and by her sweet De∣portment, made up, in some Degree, for her Husband's Churlishness—This is to be a Help-meet indeed—Such a Woman will be praised in the Gate; and her Husband get Glory, and meet with Respect on her Account. And ought a Woman to be the Glory of her Husband? How much more ought you, that are the Lamb's Bride, so to live, and so to walk, as to bring Glory, and gain Respect, to the Cause and Interest of your Husband Je∣sus? This is what the Apostle every where supposes, when he wou'd draw a Parallel be∣tween a temporal and spiritual Marriage—<HI>The Woman,</HI> says he, <HI>is the Glory of her Husband, even as the Church is the Glory of Christ</HI>—A∣greeably to this, he tells the <HI>Corinthians, whe∣ther you eat or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the Glory of God;</HI> and as he also be∣speaks the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> ii. 11, 12. <HI>As you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every One of you (as a Father doth his Children) that ye wou'd walk worthy of God who hath called you to his Kingdom, and his Glory</HI>—What an Expression is here! That ye wou'd walk worthy of God—Oh! How ought this, and such like Texts▪ to stir up your pure Minds, O Believers, so to have your Conversation in this World, that you

may be, what the Apostle says some particu∣lar Persons were, even <HI>the Glory of Christ</HI>—You are his Glory; he rejoices over you with singing; and you should so walk, that all, who know and hear of you, may glorify Christ in you.—</P>

ought Believers, whether Men or Women, to be subject to Jesus Christ—For he is the Head of the Church—He has bought her by his Blood—Believers therefore are not their own; but are under the highest Obligations to glorify and obey Jesus Christ, in their Bodies, and their Souls, which are his—Add to this, that his Ser∣vice as it is admirably expressed in one of our Col∣lects, is perfect Freedom—His Command∣ments, holy, just, and good—And therefore, it is your highest Priviledge, O Believers, to submit to, and obey them—Earthly Hus∣bands may be so mean, as to impose some Things upon their Wives, merely to shew their Authority; but it is not so with Jesus Christ—He can and does impose nothing, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what immediately conduces to our present, as well as future Good—In doing, nay, in suf∣fering for Jesus Christ, there is a present un∣speakable Reward—And therefore I may say to Believers, as the blessed Virgin said to the Servants, at the Marriage of <HI>Canaan; What∣soever he says unto you▪ do it—For his Yoke is easy, and his Burden is light.</HI>—And I believe, it might easily be proved in a few Minutes, that all the Disorders, that are now in the World, whether in Church or State, are ow∣ing to a Want of being universally, unanimous∣ly, chearfully, and perseveringly conformed to the Laws and Example of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</P>

Again, <HI>Faithfulness</HI> in the marriage State, is strictly enjoined, in the Scriptures of Truth—<HI>Marriage,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>is honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled—But Whoremon∣gers and Adulterers, God will judge</HI>—Nay, Adultery is an Iniquity to be punished by the Earthly Judges; it dissolves the marriage Re∣lation—<HI>For the Man has not Power over his own Body, but the Woman; neither has the Woman Power over her own Body, but the Man</HI>—The Heathens themselves have been taught this by the Light of Nature; and Adultery, among some of them, is punished with imme∣diate Death—And ought married Persons to be thus careful, to keep the Marriage-Bed un∣defiled, how carefully then ought Believers to keep their Souls chaste, pure and undefiled, now they are espoused to Jesus Christ? For there is such a Thing as spiritual Adultery—<HI>O ye Adulterers, and Adulteresses,</HI> saith St. <HI>James</HI>—And God frequently complains of his People's playing the Harlot—Hence it is, that St. <HI>John,</HI> in the most endearing Manner, ex∣horts Believers to keep themselves from Idols—For the Lust of the Eye, the Lust of the Flesh, and Pride of Life, are always ready to steal away our Hearts from Jesus Christ.

<P>But it is Time for me to draw towards the Close of this Head—<HI>Fruitfulness</HI> was a Bles∣sing promised by God to the First happy Pair: <HI>Encrease and multiply,</HI> says God, <HI>and replenish the Earth—Lo Children, and the Fruit of the Womb,</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>are a Gift and He∣ritage, which cometh of the Lord</HI>—And so, if we are married to Jesus Christ, we must be fruitful—In what? In every good Word and Work—For thus speaks the Apostle, in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,—Wherefore my Bre∣thren, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e also are become dead to the Law, by the Body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the Dead</HI>—What follows? <HI>That we should bring forth Fruit unto God</HI>—Glorious Words, and proper to be considered in a peculiar Man∣ner, by such who wou'd explode the Doc∣trine of Free Justification, as an <HI>Antinomian</HI> Doctrine, as tho' it destroyed good Works—No, it establishes, and lays a solid Founda∣tion, whereon to build the Super-structure of good Works—<HI>Timothy</HI> is therefore command∣ed to exhort Believers, to be careful to main∣tain good Works—And <HI>herein,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>is my Father justified, that ye bring forth much Fruit—Let your Light shine before Men, that they may see your good Works, and glorify

<P>Moreover it is required of Wives, that they n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> only love, and reverence their Husbands, but that they also love and respect their Hus∣band's <HI>Friends</HI>—And if we are married to Je∣sus Christ, we shall not only reverence the Bridegroom, but we shall also love and ho∣nour the Bridegroom's <HI>Friends—By this shall all Men know,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>that ye are my Disciples, if ye love one another—By this we know,</HI> says his beloved Disciple, <HI>that we have passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren</HI>—Observe, <HI>the Brethren,</HI> indefinite∣ly, of whatever Denomination—And this Love must be without Dissimulation, with a pure Heart fervently—This was the Case of the primitive Christians—They were all of one Heart, and of one Mind—It was said of them (Oh that it could be said of us!) <HI>See how these Christians love one another!</HI>▪ They were of the same Spirit, as a good Woman in <HI>Scotland</HI> was, who when she saw a great Multitude, as is customary in that Country, coming from various Parts, to receive the blessed Sacrament, saluted them with a <HI>Come in ye Blessed of the Lord, I have a House that will hold a Hundred of you, and a Heart that will hold Ten Thousand—</HI> Let us go and do likewise.—</P>

Once more—Persons that are married take one another for <HI>better or for worse,</HI> for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish each o∣ther in Sickness and in Health.—And if we are married to Jesus Christ, we shall be wil∣ling to wear his <HI>Cross,</HI> as well as bear his <HI>Crown—If any Man,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his Cross and follow me.</HI>—Neither will they be compelled to do this, as <HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Cyrene</HI> was, but they will be Voluntiers in his Service, they will cry out, <HI>Crown him, Crown him,</HI> when others are crying out, <HI>Crucify him, Crucify him.</HI>—They will never leave or forsake him, but willingly follow the Captain of their Salvation, tho' it be thro' a Sea of Blood.—</P>
<P>I might run the Parallel still further, and also enlarge upon the Hints already given—But I fear I have said enough already, to re∣proach most Believers; I am sure I have said more than enough, to abash and upbraid my∣self—For alas! how vilely, treacherously, and ungratefully, have we behaved towards our spiritual Husband, the dear Lord Jesus, ever since the Day of our Espousals?

<P>THOUGH here is a large and awful Assembly, yet I suppose, you are all convinced, that you are not to live in this World always—May I not take it for granted, that even the most Prophane amongst you, do in your Hearts believe, what the sacred Oracles have most clearly revealed, <HI>viz.</HI>—<HI>That as it is appointed for all Men once to die, so after Death comes the Judgme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t?</HI> Yes, I know that you believe, that nothing is

more certain, than that we are <HI>to appear be∣fore the Judgment-Seat of Christ, to be re∣warded according to the Deeds done in the Body, whether they have been good, or whether they have been Evil.</HI>—And, however hard the Saying may seem to you at the first Hearing, yet I cannot help informing you, that I am thoroughly persuaded, that as many will be driven from that Judgment-seat, with a, <HI>De∣part ye cursed into everlasting Fire,</HI> for pur∣suing things in <HI>themselves lawful▪</HI> out of a <HI>wrong Principle,</HI> and in <HI>too intense a Degree,</HI> as for Drunkenness, Adultery, Fornication, or any other gross Enormity whatsoever—Bad as the World is, blessed be God, there are great Numbers yet left amongst us, who ei∣ther thro' the Restraints of a religious Educa∣tion; or Self-love, and outward Reputation, both abstain from gross Sin themselves▪ and look with Detestation and Abhor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> upon others, that indulge themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—But then, thro' an over eager Pursuit▪ after the Things of Sense and Time, their Souls are insensibly lulled into a spiritual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lumber, and by Degrees become as dead to God▪ and as deaf to all the gracious Invitati∣ons of the Gospel, as the most abandoned Pro∣digals.—It is remarkable, therefore, that our Saviour, knowing how desperately wicked and treacherous the Heart of Man was in this, as well as other Respects, after he had cau∣tion'd

his Disciples, and us in them, to take heed that their Hearts were not at any time <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>charged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness,</HI> immediately adds▪ and <HI>the Cares (i. e.</HI> the im∣moderate anxious Cares) <HI>of this Life.</HI>—For they are of a distracting, intoxicating Nature, and soon overcharge and weigh down the Hearts of the Children of Men:—To prevent or remedy this Evil, our Lord, during the Time of his tabe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acling here below, spake many Parables; but not one more pertinent, not one, in which the Freeness of the Gospel∣C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, the frivolous Pretences Men frame to ex∣cuse themselves from embracing it, and the dreadful Doom they incur by so doing, is more displayed, or set off in livelier Colours, than that to which the Words of the Text refer: <HI>And the Lord said unto the Servant, go out into the Highways and Hedges, and com∣pel them to come in, that my House may be filled: For I say unto you, that none of those that were hidden, shall taste of my Supper.</HI>—In order to have a clear View of the Occasion, Scope, and Contents of the Parable, to which these Words belong, it is necessary for us to look back to the very Beginning of this Chapter.—<HI>And it came to pass,</HI> says the Evangelist, Verse 1<HI>st, as he went into the House of one of the chief Pha∣risees to eat Bread, on the Sabbath Day, that they watched him.</HI> The Person here spoken of, as going into this Pharisee's House, is our

blessed Saviour—For as he came eating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drinking, agreeable to his Character, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> free, courteous and affable to all;—And there∣fore, tho' it was on the Sabbath Day, he ac∣cepted an Invitation, and went into the House of one of the chief Pharisees, to eat Bread notwithstanding he knew the Pharisees were his professed Enemies, and that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, hoping to find some Occasion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, either for his Discourse or Behaviour.▪ If the Pharisee, into whose House our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> went, was one of this Stamp, his Invitatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bespeaks him to be a very ill Man, and may serve to teach us, that much Rancour, and Heart-enmity against Jesus Christ, may be con∣cealed and cloaked under a great and blazing Profession of Religion.—However, our Savi∣our was more than a Match for all his Ene∣mies, and by accepting this Invitation, hath warranted his Ministers and Disciples, to com∣ply with the like Invitations, and converse free∣ly about the Things of God, tho' those who invite them, may not have real Religion at heart.—For how knowest thou, O Man, but thou mayest drop something, that may benefit their Souls, and make them religious indeed? And supposing they should watch thee, watch thou▪ unto Prayer, whilst thou art in their Company, and that same Jesus, who went in∣to this Pharisee's House, and was so faithful and edifying in his Conversation when there,

will enable thee to go and do likewise.—That our Lord's Conversation was not trifling, but such as tended to the Use of Edifying, and that he behaved among the Guests as a faith∣ful Physician, rather than as a careless, indif∣ferent Companion, is evident from the 7th Verse of this Chapter, where we are told, that <HI>he marked how they chose the chief Rooms;</HI> or, to speak in our common Way, were desirous of sitting at the upper End of the Table—For whether we think of it or not, the Lord Jesus takes notice of our Behaviour, even when we are going to sit down only at our common Meals.—And would to God, all that make a Profession of real Christianity, considered this well!—Religion then would not be so much confined to Church, or Meeting, but be brought home to our private Houses, and many needless unchristian Compliments be prevented.—For (with Grief I speak it) is it not too true, that abundance of Professors love, and are too fond of the uppermost Places in Houses, as well as Synagogues? And are not many, who cry out against all Ceremonies in the Church, too stu∣dious of Ceremony in their Parlours? This was what our Lord blamed in the Guests where he now was.—<HI>He marked,</HI> he took notice, he looked before he spake (as we should always do, if we would speak to the Purpose) how they chose out <HI>the chief Rooms,</HI>—Therefore, tho' they were rich in this World's Goods, and were none of his Guests▪

yet unwilling to suffer the least Sin upon them, or lose any Opportunity of giving Instruction, he gave them a Lecture upon Humility, saying unto them, that is, directing his Discourse to all in general, tho' probably, he spake to one in particular, that sat near him, and whom it may be, he took notice of, as more than or∣dinarily solicitous in choosing a chief Room, or Couch, on which they lay at Meals after the Custom of the <HI>Romans; When thou art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idden</HI> (Verse 8.) <HI>of any Man to a Wedding,</HI> which seems to intimate that this was a Wed∣ding-feast) <HI>sit not down in the highest Room, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t a more honourable Man than thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idden of Him; And he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade thee and him</HI> (Verse 9th) <HI>come and say to thee, give this Man Place, and thou begin with Shame to take the lowest Room.

agreeable to the Word of God in this Respect, who say, we must not, at least need not, re∣prove natural Men? Surely such Doctrine cometh not from above! For are we not com∣manded, in any wise to reprove our Neigh∣bour (whether he be a Child of God or no) and not to suffer Sin upon him? Is it not more than probable, that all these Guests were na∣tural Men? and yet our Lord reproved them.—<Q>Help us then, O Saviour, in this and every other Instance of thy Moral Conduct, to walk as thou hast set us an Example.</Q>—Neither did our Lord stop here; but, observ∣ing, that none but the Rich, the Mighty, and the Noble, were called to the Feast, he took occasion also from thence, to give even his Host (for the best Return we can make our Friends for their Kindness, is to be faithful to their Souls) one of the chief Pharisees, a wholsome Piece of Advice.—<HI>Then said he also to him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade him</HI> (Verse 12th) <HI>when thou makest a Dinner or a Supper, call not thy Friends, nor thy Brethren, neither thy Kins∣men, nor thy rich Neighbours; left they also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id thee again, and a Recompence be made thee.—But when thou makest a Feast</HI> (Verse 13th) <HI>call the Poor, the Maimed, the Lame, the Blind: And thou shalt be blessed;</HI> (Verse 14th) <HI>for they cannot recompence thee: For thou shalt be recompenced at the Resurrection of the Just.</HI>—Thus did our Lord entertain the Company.

Words spoken in such due Season, how good are they▪ Would Christ's Followers thus ex∣ert themselves, and▪ when in Company, begin some useful Discourse for their great Master, they know not what Good they might do, and how many might be influenced by their good Example, to second them in it! An Instance of this we have in the 14th Verse of this Chapter—<HI>And when one of them,</HI> says the Evangelist, <HI>that sat at Meat with him, heard these Things, he said unto him, blessed is he that shall eat Bread in the Kingdom of God.</HI> Hap∣py they that shall be recompenced at that Resurrection of the Just, which thou hast been speaking of.—A very pertinent Saying this! Every way suitable to Persons sitting down to eat Bread on Earth, which we should never do, without talking of, and longing for that Time, when we shall sit down and eat Bread in the Kingdom of Heaven—This opened to our Lord a fresh Topick of Conversation, and gave Birth to the Parable, which is to be the more immediate Subject of your present Medi∣tation—As tho' he had said to the Person that spoke last, "Thou sayest right; blessed are they indeed, who shall sit down to eat Bread in the Kingdom of God; But alas! most Men, espe∣cially you Pharisees, act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s if you did not be∣lieve this, and therefore (<HI>verse</HI> 16) he said unto him, <HI>A certain Man made a great Sup∣per, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad many;</HI> by the certain Man mak∣ing

<P>If we would take a View of the whole Sto∣ry, we must go back to the 46th Verse of this Chapter—<HI>And</HI> they, <HI>i. e.</HI> our Lord and his Disciples (who, we find by the Context, had been conversing together) <HI>came to Jericho</HI>—A Place devoted by <HI>Joshua</HI> to the Curse of God—And yet, even this Place yields Con∣verts to Jesus—<HI>Zaccheus</HI> had been called out of it formerly; and <HI>Bartimeus,</HI> as we shall hear by and by, in all Probability, was called now.—For some Good may come even out of <HI>Nazareth</HI>—Christ himself was born there, and his sovereign Grace can reach, and overcome the worst of People, in the very worst of Places.—<HI>Jesus come to Jericho</HI>—Let not his Ministers, if Providence points out their Way, shun go∣ing to seemingly the most unlikely Places to do Good—Some chosen Vessels may be there∣in—Jesus and his Disciples came to <HI>Jericho</HI>—They were <HI>Itinerants;</HI> and, as I have frequently observed, seldom stayed long in a Place—Not that this is any Argument against the stated Settlement of particular Pastors over particular Parishes.—But however, our Lord's Practice, in this Respect, gives a Kind of a Sanction to <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant</HI> Preaching, when Persons are pro∣perly called to, and qualified for, such an Em∣ploy.—And I believe we may venture to af∣firm

It was the unjust Steward that said, <HI>to beg I am ashamed.</HI> It is our Pride, that often makes us unwilling to be beholden—Jesus was not thus minded—He lived, as it were, upon Alms—The Women that followed him, ministred to him of their Substance.—<HI>Bartimeus</HI> not being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to dig, begs for his Living; and in order to make a better Trade of it, sat by the High∣way-side, in all Probability, without, or near the Gate of the City, where People must necessarily pass in and out.

Multitude that heard his piteous Cry, into Compassion, and induced some at least to turn Suitors in his Behalf, or help carry him to the blessed Jesus.—But instead of that, we are told, Verse 48th, that <HI>many charged him</HI>—The Word in the Original seems to imply, a Charge attended with <HI>Threatning,</HI> and spo∣ken in an angry Manner.—They charged him to hold his Peace; and it may be, threatned to beat him if he did not.

<P>A natural Man, indeed, goes no further than the outward Court of the Scripture, and reads this, and the other Miracles of our blessed Sa∣viour, just in the same Manner as he reads <HI>Homer's</HI> Battles, or the Exploits of <HI>Alexander</HI>—But God forbid, that we shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d rest in on∣ly hearing this Matter of Fact—For I tell thee, O Man, I tell thee, O Woman, whoever thou art, that fittest this Day under a preached Gos∣pel, that if thou art in a natural State, thou art as blind in thy Soul, as <HI>Bartimeus</HI> was in his Body; a blind Child of a blind Father, even of thy Father <HI>Adam,</HI> who lost his Sight when he lost his Innocence, and entailed his Blindness, justly inflicted, upon thee, and me, and his whole Posterity.—Some think indeed, that they see—But alas! such talk only like Men in their Sleep, like Persons besides them∣selves—The Scriptures every where represent Fallen-Man, not only as spiritually Blind, but dead also; and we no more know, by Nature, savingly the Way of Salvation by Jesus Christ, than <HI>Bartimeus,</HI> when he was blind, knew the Colours of the Rainbow—This, I trust,

I know your Answer wou'd be, <HI>that we may receive our Sight</HI>—And God forbid, that I should charge you to hold your Peace, as tho' Jesus wou'd not regard you!—No, your being made sensible of your natural Blindness, and crying thus earnestly after Jesus, is a Sign at least, that you are awakened by his Holy Spirit (tho' it is possible, that you may cry with an exceeding bitter Cry, as <HI>Esau</HI> did, and be lost at last—) however, Christian Cha∣rity induces me to believe and hope the best—I will therefore, in the Language of those who afterwards encouraged <HI>Bartimeus,</HI> say un∣to you, <HI>arise, take Comfort,;</HI> for I trust, Jesus is calling you—Follow therefore the Example of <HI>Bartimeus, cast away your Garment; la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aside every Weight, and the Sin which doth most easily beset you,</HI> arise, and come to Jesus—He commands me, by his written Word, to call to you and say, <HI>Come unto him, all ye that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eary, and heavy laden,</HI> and he will refresh you—He will give you rest—Be not afraid—Ye seek Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI>—Behold, he comes forth to meet you—Ye are now on the High∣way Side, and Jesus, I trust, is passing by—I feel his Presence—I hope, many of you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>el it too—Oh then, cry mightily to him, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is Mighty and Willing to save you—Lay your∣selves

Blind as you are, you shall notwithstanding receive your Sight—Satan indeed, and Unbelief will suggest many Objections to you—Your carnal Relations will also join Issue with them, and charge you to hold your Peace—One will tell you, that your Blindness is too inveterate to be cured; another, that it is too late; a third, that tho' Jesus can, yet he will not have Mer∣cy upon such poor, blind, despicable Beggars, as ye are—But, the more they charge you to hold your Peace, do you cry out so much the more a great deal, <HI>Jesus, thou Son of David, have Mercy on us</HI>—Jesus, thou Saviour, thou Friend of Sinners, <HI>Thou Son of David,</HI> and there∣fore a Son of Man—Oh gracious Words!

not yourselves too high to stoop to Jesus—For he is the King of Kings; and you never will be truly rich, until you are made rich in Jesus—Fear not being despised, or losing a little worldly Honour: One Sight of Jesus will make amends for all: You will find something so inviting, so attracting, so satisfying, in the altogether-lovely Lamb of God, that every sublunary Enjoyment will sicken, and die, and vanish before you; and you will no more de∣sire your former vain and trifling Amusements, than <HI>Bartimeus</HI> after he had received his Sight, desired to go back again and fetch his Gar∣ment—Oh that there may be many such blind Beggars among you this Day!

<P>VARIOUS are the Pleas and Argu∣ments which Men of corrupt Minds frequently urge against yielding Obe∣dience to the just and holy Commands of God—But perhaps, one of the most com∣mon Objections that they make is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That our Lord's Commands are not practicable, because contrary to Flesh and Blood; and consequently, that he is an hard Master, <HI>reap∣ing where he has not sown, and gathering where he has not strawed</HI>—These we find were the Sentiments that were entertained by that wicked and slothful Servant mentioned in the 25th of St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> and are undoubtedly the same with many which obtain in the pre∣sent wicked and adulterous Generation—The Holy Ghost foreseeing this, hath taken care

to inspire holy Men of Old, to record the Examples of many holy Men and Women; who, even under the Old Testament Dispen∣sation, were enabled chearfully to take Christ's Yoak upon them, and counted his Service perfect Freedom.—The large Catalogue of Saints, Confessors, and Martyrs, drawn up in the 11th Chapter to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> abundantly evidences the Truth of this Observation—What a great Cloud of Witnesses have we there presented to our View? All eminent for their Faith, but some shining with a great∣er Degree of Lustre than the others.—The Proto-Martyr <HI>Abel,</HI> leads the Van—And next to him, we find <HI>Enoch</HI> mentioned, not only because he was next in Order of Time, but also on account of his exalted Piety.—He is spoken of in the Words of the Text in a very extraordinary Manner—We have here a short, but very full and glorious Account, both of his Behaviour in this World, and in the tri∣umphant Manner of his entering into the next—The former is contained in these Words—<HI>And Enoch walked with God</HI>—The latter in these, <HI>and he was not: for God took him. He was not; i. e.</HI> He was <HI>not found,</HI> he was not taken away in the common Manner, <HI>he did not see Death;</HI> for <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 5. <HI>God had trans∣lated him.</HI> Who this <HI>Enoch</HI> was, does not appear so plainly.—To me, he seems to have been a Person of publick Character—
<PB N="101" REF="005885_0112_10275E89AB93A3C0"/>
I suppose, like <HI>Noah,</HI> a Preacher of Righte∣ousness—And, if we may credit the Apostle <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> he was a flaming Preacher—For he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one of his Prophecies, wherein he saith, <HI>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten Thousand of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Saints—To execute Judgment upon all, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> convince all that are Ungodly among them, of all their ungodly Deeds which they have un∣godly committed, and of all their hard Speeches, which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him</HI>—B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t whether a publick or private Person, he has a noble Testimony given him in the lively Oracles. The Author of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> saith, that before his Translation he had this Testimony, <HI>that he pleased God;</HI> and his being translated, was a Proof of it be∣yond all Doubt—And I wou'd observe by the by, that it was wonderful Wisdom in God to translate <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah</HI> under the Old Te∣stament Dispensation, that hereafter when it should be asserted, that the Lord Jesus was carried into Heaven, it might not seem a Thing altogether incredible to the <HI>Jews;</HI> since they themselves confessed, that two of their own Pro∣phets had been translated several hundred Years before.—But it is not my Design to detain you any longer, by Enlarging, or making Observa∣tions on <HI>Enoch'</HI>s short, but comprehensive Character—The Thing I have in view, being to give a Discourse as the Lord shall enable, upon a weighty and very important Subject,
<PB N="102" REF="005885_0113_10275E9094EE94E0"/>
I mean, <HI>Walking with God—And Enoch wal∣ked with God</HI>—If so much as this can be truly said of you and me after our Decease, we shall not have any Reason to complain, that we have lived in vain.—</P>
<P>In handling my intended Subject, I shall, <HI>First,</HI> endeavour to shew, what is implied in these Words, <HI>Walked with God—Secondly,</HI> I shall prescribe some Means, upon the due Ob∣servance of which, Believers may keep up and maintain their <HI>Walk with God</HI>—And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Offer some Motives to stir us up, if we never walked with God before, to come and walk with God now—The Whole shall be closed with a Word▪ or two of Applicati∣on.—</P>
<P>And, <HI>First,</HI> I am to shew what is implied in these Words, <HI>Walked with God;</HI> or in other Words, what we are to understand by this Term, <HI>Walking with God.</HI>—</P>
<P>And, <HI>First, Walking with God,</HI> implies, that the prevailing Power of the Enmity of a Person's Heart, be taken away by the blessed Spirit of God.—Perhaps it may seem a hard Saying to some, but our own Experience daily proves what the Scriptures in many Places assert, that the carnal Mind, the Mind of the uncon∣verted, natural Man, nay, the Mind of the Regenerate, so far as any Part of him remains

unrenewed, is Enmity, not only an Enemy, but <HI>Enmity</HI> itself <HI>against God;</HI> so that it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can it be—Indeed one may well wonder that any Creature, especially that lovely Creature Man, made after his Maker's own Image, should ever have any Enmity, much less a prevail∣ing Enmity against that very God in whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he lives, and moves, and hath his Being—But alas! so it is—Our first Parents con∣tracted it when they fell from God by eating the forbidden Fruit, and the bitter and malig∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant Contagion of it, hath descended to, and quite overspread their whole Posterity—This Enmity discovered itself in <HI>Adam'</HI>s endeavour∣ing to hide himself in the Trees of the Garden—When he heard the Voice of the Lord God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstead of running, with an open Heart, saying, Here am I; alas! he now wanted no Com∣munion with God; and still more discovered his lately contracted Enmity by the Excuse he made to the most High—<HI>The Woman,</HI> or <HI>This Woman thou gavest to be with me, she gave me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Tree, and I did eat</HI>—By saying thus, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Effect lays all the Fault upon God; as tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had said, If thou hadst not given me this Woman, I had not sinned against thee, so thou mayst thank thyself for my Transgression—In this same Manner this Enmity works in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Hearts of <HI>Adam'</HI>s Children—They now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d again find something rising against God,

<HI>the holy Spirit should be in, and with them;</HI> not to be like a Wayfaring-Man, to stay only for a Night, but to reside and make his Abode in their Hearts—This I am apt to believe is what the Apostle <HI>John</HI> would have us under∣stand, when he talks of a Person abiding in him, <HI>viz.</HI> in Christ, <HI>and walking as he himself also walked</HI>—And this is what is particularly meant in the Words of our Text—<HI>And Enoch wal∣ked with God, i. e.</HI> He kept up and maintained a holy, settled, habitual, tho' und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubtedly not altogether uninterupted Communion and Fel∣lowship with God, in and thro' Christ Jesus—So that to sum up what has been said on this Part of the first General Head, <HI>Walking with God</HI> consists especially in the fixed habitual Bent of the Will for God, in an habitual De∣pendance upon his Power and Promise, in an habitual voluntary Dedication of our All to his Glory, in a habitual Eyeing of his Precept in all we do, and in an habitual Complacence in his Pleasure in all we suffer.—</P>

<P>From what then has been said, we may now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what is implied in these Words, <HI>walked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, viz.</HI> Our having the prevailing En∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>y of our Hearts taken away by the Power of the Spirit of God; our being actually recon∣ciled and united to him by Faith in Jesus Christ; our having and keeping up a settled Communion and Fellowship with him; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> making a daily Progress in this Fellowship, in as to be conformed to the divine Image more and more.—</P>
<P>How this is done, or in other Words, by what Means Believers keep up and maintain their Walk with God, comes to be considered under our <HI>Second</HI> General Head.—</P>
<P>And, <HI>First,</HI> Believers keep up and main∣tain their Walk with God, by reading of his Holy Word—<HI>Search the Scriptures,</HI> says our blessed Lord, <HI>for these are they that testify of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>—And the royal Psalmist tells us, <HI>that God's Word was as a Light unto his Feet, and a Lanthorn unto his Paths;</HI> and he makes it one Property of a good Man, <HI>that his Delight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Law of the Lord,</HI> and that <HI>he exer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es himself therein Day and Night—Give thy∣self
<PB N="110" REF="005885_0121_102760036C65EFB0"/>
to Reading,</HI> says <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy; And this Book of the Law,</HI> says God to <HI>Joshua, shall not go out of thy Mouth: For whatsoever was written afore time, was written for our Learning.</HI>—And <HI>the Word of God is profita∣ble for Reproof, Correction, and Instruction in Righteousness,</HI> and every way sufficient to make every true Child of God throughly furnished to every good Work.—If we once get above our Bibles, and cease making the written Word of God our sole Rule, both as to Faith and Practice, we shall soon lie open to all Man∣ner of Delusion, and be in great Danger of making Ship-wreck of Faith and a good Con∣science—Our blessed Lord, tho' he had the Spirit of God without Measure, yet always was governed by, and fought the Devil with an, <HI>It is written.</HI> This the Apostle calls the <HI>Sword of the Spirit</HI>—We may say of it as <HI>Da∣vid</HI> said of <HI>Goliah'</HI>s Sword, <HI>None like this</HI>—The Scriptures are called the lively Oracles of God—Not only because they are generally made use of to beget us into new Life, but also to keep up and increase it in the Soul.—The Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> in his 2d Epistle, prefers it even to seeing Christ transfigured upon the Mount—For after he had said Chap, i. 18. <HI>That the Voice which came from Heaven we heard, when we were with him in the Holy Mount.</HI>—He adds, Verse 19. <HI>We have also a more sure Word of Prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take
<PB N="111" REF="005885_0122_1026E4B9B4E6A5F8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed, as unto a Light shining in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-star arise in your Hearts: i. e.</HI> Till we shake off these Bodies, and see Jesus Face to Face—Till we must see and converse with him through the Glass of his Word.—We must make his Testi∣monies our Councellors, and daily, with <HI>Ma∣ry,</HI> sit at Jesu's Feet, by Faith hearing his Word. We shall then by happy Experience find, that they are Spirit and Life, Meat indeed, and Drink indeed, to our Souls.—</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Believers keep up and maintain their Walk with God by secret Prayer—The Spirit of Grace is always accompanied with the Spirit of Supplication—It is the very Breath of the New-Creature, the Fan of the divine Life, whereby the Spark of holy Fire kindled in the Soul by God, is not only kept in, but raised into a Flame—A Neglect of secret Pray∣er, has been frequently an Inlet to many spiri∣tual Diseases, and has been attended with fatal Consequences.—<HI>Origen</HI> observed, <Q>That the Day he offered Incense to an Idol, he went out of his Closet without making use of secret Prayer</Q>—It is one of the Most noble Parts of the Believer's spiritual Armour—<HI>Pray∣ing always,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>with all Manner of Supplication—And watch and pray,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>that ye enter not into Temptation</HI>—And he spake a Parable, that his Disciples should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not faint—Not that our Lord would
<PB N="112" REF="005885_0123_1026E4D0A75A2860"/>
have us always upon our Knees, or in our Closets, to the Neglect of our other relative Duties—But he means that our Souls should be kept in a Praying-Frame, so that we might be able to say, as a good Man in <HI>Scotland</HI> once said to his Friends on a Death-bed, <Q>Could these Curtains, or could these Walls speak, they would tell you what sweet Communi∣on I have had with my God here.</Q>—Oh Pray∣er, Prayer! It brings and keeps God and Man toge∣ther—It raises Man up to God, and brings God down to Man.—If you wou'd therefore, O Believers, keep up your Walk with God▪ Pray, Pray without ceasing—Be much in secret, set Prayer—And when you are about the com∣mon Business of Life, be much in ejaculatory Prayer, and send, from time to time, short Let∣ters post to Heaven upon the Wings of Faith—They will reach the very Heart of God, and return to you again loaded with spiritual Bles∣sings.</P>
<P>Holy and frequent Meditation is another blessed Means of keeping up a Believer's Walk with God—<Q>Prayer, Reading, Temptation, and Meditation, says <HI>Luther,</HI> make a Minister</Q>—And they also make, and keep a Christian—Meditation to the Soul, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame as Digestion to the Body—Holy <HI>David</HI> found it so, and therefore he was frequently employed in Meditation, even in the Night Season.—We read also of <HI>Isaac'</HI>s going out into
<PB N="113" REF="005885_0124_1026E4D32FB74560"/>
the Fields to meditate in the Evening; or as it is in the Margin to pray—For Meditation is a Kind of silent Prayer, whereby the Soul is frequently, as it were, carried out of it self to God, and in a Degree made like unto those blessed Spirits, who by a Kind of immediate Intuition always behold the Face of our hea∣venly Father—None but those happy Souls that have been accustomed to this divine Em∣ploy, can tell what a blessed Promoter of the divine Life Meditation is—<HI>Whilst I was Mu∣sing,</HI> says <HI>David; the Fire kindled</HI>—And whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the Believer is musing on the Works and Word of God; especially that Work of Works, that Wonder of Wonders, that Mystery of Godli∣ness, God manifest in the Flesh, the Lamb of God slain for the Sins of the World: He fre∣quently feels the Fire of divine Love kindle, so that he is obliged to speak with his Tongue, and tell of the Loving-kindness of the Lord to his Soul—Be frequent therefore in Meditation all ye that desire to keep up and maintain a close and uniform Walk with the most High God:</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Believers keep up their Walk with God, by watching and noting his providential Dealings with them—If we believe the Scrip∣tures, we must believe what our Lord hath declared therein, <HI>viz. That the very Hairs of his Disciples Heads are all numbred;</HI> and that <HI>a Sparrow does not fall to the Ground,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="005885_0125_10275EA429405D20"/>
either to pick up a Grain of Corn, or when shot by a Fowler, <HI>without the Knowledge of our Heavenl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Father</HI>—Every Cross has a Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in it, and every particular Dispensation of di∣vine Providence, has some particular End to answer in those to whom it is sent—If it be of an afflictive Nature, God does thereby say, "My Son, keep thy self fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Idols:" If Prosperous, he does as it were by a small, still Voice, say, "My Son, give me thy Heart"—If Believers therefore wou'd keep up their Walk with God, they must from time to time hear what the Lord has to say concerning them in the Voice of his Providence—Thus we find <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Servant, when he went to fetch a Wife for his Master <HI>Isaac,</HI> eyed and watched the Providence of God, and by that Means found out the Person that was design'd for his Master's Wife—"For a little Hint from Pro∣vidence," says pious Bishop <HI>Hall,</HI> <Q>is enough for Faith to feed upon.</Q>—And as I believe it will be one Part of our Happiness in Hea∣ven, to take a View of, and look back upon, the various Links of the Golden-Chain which drew us there; so those that enjoy most of Heaven below, I believe will be most minute in remarking God's various Dealings with them, in respect to his providential Dispen∣sations here on Earth.—</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> In order to walk closely with God, his Children must not only watch the Motions
<PB N="115" REF="005885_0126_10275EA9C6A72BB8"/>
of God's Providence without them, but the Motions also of his blessed Spirit in their Hearts—As many as are the Sons of God, are led by the Spirit of God, and give up themselves to be guided by the Holy Ghost, as a little Child gives its Hand to be led by a Nurse or Parent. It is no doubt in this Sense, that we are to be converted, and become like <HI>little Children</HI>—And tho' it is the Quintescence of Enthusiasm, to pretend to be guided by the Spirit without the written Word; yet it is every Christian's bounden Duty to be guided by the Spirit, in Conjunction with the written Word of God—Watch therefore, I pray you, O Believers, the Motions of God's blessed Spirit in your Souls, and always try the Suggestions or Im∣pressions that you may at any time feel, by the unerring Rule of God's most holy Word—And if they are not found to be agreeable to that, reject them as diabolical and delusive—By ob∣serving this Caution, you will steer a middle Course between the two dangerous Extremes many of this Generation are in Danger of run∣ning into; I mean, Enthusiasm, on the one Hand, and Deism, and downright Infidelity, on the other.—</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Those that would maintain a holy Walk with God, must walk with him in Or∣dinances as well as Providences, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> It is therefore recorded of <HI>Zachary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that <HI>they walked in all God's Ordinances as
<PB N="116" REF="005885_0127_10275EADF9D7D898"/>
well as Commandments, blameless</HI>—And all right∣ly informed Christians will look upon Ordi∣nances not as <HI>beggarly Elements,</HI> but as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o ma∣ny Conduit Pipes, whereby the infinitely con∣descending Jehovah conveys his Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Souls—They will look upon them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Childrens Bread, and as their highest Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ledges—Consequently they will be glad when they hear others say, <HI>Come let us go up to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> House of the Lord</HI>—They will delight to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Place where God's Honour dwelleth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be very eager to embrace all Opportuniti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>to shew forth the Lord</HI> Christ's <HI>Death till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come.</HI>—</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> and <HI>Lastly,</HI> If you would Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with God, you must associate and keep Com∣pany with those that do Walk with him—<HI>My Delight,</HI> says holy <HI>David, is in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that do excel in Virtue</HI>—They were in his Sight the excellent Ones of the Earth—And the primitive Christians no doubt kept up their Vigour and first Love, by continuing in Fellowship one with another—The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> knew this full well, and therefore exhorts the Christians to <HI>see to it,</HI> that they did not <HI>forsake the Assembling of</HI> themselves <HI>together</HI>—For how can one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e warm alone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And has not the wisest of Men told us, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Iron sharp'neth Iron, so doth the Countenance of a Man his Friend?</HI> If we look therefore into Church History, or make a just Obser∣vation
<PB N="117" REF="005885_0128_10275EAFB1134B20"/>
of our own Times, I believe we shall find, that as the Power of God prevails, Chri∣stian Societies, and Fellowship Meetings, pre∣vail proportionably—And as one decays, the other has insensibly decayed and dwindled away at the same Time—So necessary is it for those that wou'd Walk with God, and keep up the Life of Religion, to meet together as they have Opportunity, in order to provoke one another to Love and good Works.—</P>
<P>Proceed we now to the <HI>third</HI> general Thing proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> To offer some Motives to excite all to come and <HI>walk with God.</HI>—</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> Walking with God is a very honourable Thing—This generally is a pre∣vailing Motive to Persons of all Ranks, to stir them up to any important Undertaking—Oh that it may have its due Weight and Influence with you, in respect to the Matter now be∣fore us! I suppose you would all think it a very high Honour to be admitted into an Earthly Prince's Privy Council, to be trusted with his Secrets, and to have his Ear at all Times, and at all Seasons—It seems <HI>Haman</HI> thought it so, when he boasted, that besides his being <HI>advanced,</HI> Esther v. 11. <HI>above the Princes and Servants of the King—Yea, more∣over said he,</HI> Verse 12, <HI>Esther the Queen did let no Man come in with the King unto the Banquet that she had prepared, but myself;
<PB N="118" REF="005885_0129_10275EB2AF324680"/>
and To-morrow am I invited unto her als<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the King</HI>—And when afterwards a Question was put to this same <HI>Haman,</HI> Chap. vi. 6. <HI>What shall be done unto the Man whom the King delighteth to honour? He answered,</HI> Verse 8. <HI>Let the Royal Apparel be brought which the King used to wear, and the Horse that the King rideth upon, and the Crown Royal which is set upon his Head; And</HI> Verse 9. <HI>let this Apparel and Horse be delivered to the Hand of one of the King's most noble Prin∣ces, that they may aray the Man withal whom the King delights to honour, and bring him on Horse-back thro' the Street of the City, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the Man whom the King delighteth to-honour.</HI>—This was all then it seems that an ambiti∣ous <HI>Haman</HI> could ask, and the most valuable Thing that he thought <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> the great∣est Monarch upon Earth, could give—But alas, what is this Honour in Comparison of that which the meanest of those enjoy, that Walk with God! Think ye it a small Thing, Sirs, to have the Secret of the Lord of Lords with you, and to be called the Friends of God? And such Honour have all God's Saints: <HI>The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</HI> and <HI>Henceforth,</HI> says the bles∣sed Jesus, <HI>call I you no longer Servants, but Friends; for the Servant knoweth not the Will of his Master.</HI>—Whatever you may
<PB N="119" REF="005885_0130_10275EB59A2AC2D0"/>
think of it, holy <HI>David</HI> was so sensible of the Honour attending a Walk with God, that he declares he <HI>had rather be a Door-keeper in his House, than to dwell even in the Tents of Un∣godliness</HI>—Oh that all were like-minded with him!—</P>
<P>But, <HI>secondly,</HI> As it is an honourable, so it is a pleasing Thing to walk with God—The wisest of Men has told us, that <HI>Wisdom's Ways are Ways of Pleasantness, and all her Paths P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace</HI>—And I remember pious Mr. <HI>Henry,</HI> when he was just about to expire, said to a Friend, <Q>You have heard many Mens dying Words, and these are mine, A Life spent in Communion with God, is the plea∣santest Life in the World.</Q> I am sure I can set to my Seal that this is true.—Indeed I have been listed under Jesu's Banner only for a few Years; but I have enjoyed more solid Pleasure in one Moments Communion with my God, than I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould or could have enjoyed in the Ways of Sin, tho' I had continued to have went on in them for Thousands of Years—And may I not appeal to all you that fear and walk with God, for the Truth of this? Has not one Day in the Lord's Courts, been better than a Thousand? In keeping God's Commandments, Have you not found a Present and very great Reward? Has not his Word been sweeter to you than the Ho∣ney, or the Honey-comb? Oh what have
<PB N="120" REF="005885_0131_10275EB8AADE9048"/>
you felt, when <HI>Jacob</HI>-like you have been wrestling with your God? Has not Je∣sus often met you when meditating in the Fields, and been made known to you over and over again in Breaking of Bread? Has not the Holy Ghost frequently shed the divine Love abroad in your Hearts abundantly, and filled you with Joy unspeakable, even Joy that is full of Glory? I know you will answer all these Questions in the Affirmative, and freely ac∣knowledge the <HI>Yoak</HI> of Christ to be <HI>easy,</HI> and <HI>his Burden light;</HI> or (to use the Words of one of our Collects) <Q>That his Service is perfect Freedom</Q>—And what need we then any further Motive to excite us to walk with God?</P>
<P>But, methinks, I hear some among you say, <Q>How can these Things be? For, if Walk∣ing with God, as you say, is such an ho∣nourable and pleasant Thing, whence is it, that the Name of the People of this Way is cast out as Evil, and every where spoken against? How comes it to pass that they are frequently afflicted, tempted, destitute, and tormented? Is this the Honour, this the Pleasure that you speak of?</Q> I Answer, Yes. Stop a while, be not over-hasty, Judge not according to Appearance, but Judge righte∣ous Judgment, and all will be well—It is true, we acknowledge the People of this Way, as you and <HI>Paul</HI> before you, when a Persecutor called them, have their Names east out as
<PB N="121" REF="005885_0132_10275EBA4FBE3660"/>
Evil, and are a Sect every where spoken a∣gainst—But by whom? Even by the Enemies of the most High God—And do you think it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Disgrace to be spoken Evil of then by them? Blessed be God we have not so learnt Christ—Our Royal Master has pronounced those <HI>bles∣sed,</HI> who are <HI>Persecuted, and have all Manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Evil spoken against them falsly</HI>—He has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣manded them to <HI>rejoice and be exceeding glad</HI>—For it is a Mark of their Discipleship, and that their Reward will be great in Heaven—He himself was thus treated—And can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here be a greater Honour put upon a Creature, than to be conformed to the ever-blessed Son of God? And further, it is equally true, that the People of this Way are frequently afflicted, tempted, destitute and tormented. But what of all this? Does this destroy the Pleasure of Walking with God? No, in no wise—For those that walk with God, are enabled, thro' Christ strengthening them, to joy even in Tri∣bulation, and to rejoice when they fall into divers Temptations.—And I believe I may ap∣peal to the Experience of all true and close Walkers with God, Whether or not their Suf∣fering Times, have not frequently been their sweetest Times, and they enjoyed most of God▪ when most cast out and despised by Men? This we find was the Case of Christ's primi∣tive Servants, when threatened by the <HI>Jewish</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and commanded to preach no more
<PB N="122" REF="005885_0133_10275EBEA82BAD18"/>
in the Name of Jesus, they rejoiced, that they were accounted worthy to suffer Shame for the Sake of Jesus—<HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> sang Praises even in a Dungeon—And the Face of <HI>Stephen,</HI> that glorious Proto-Martyr of the Christian Church, shone like the Face of an Angel—And Jesus is the same now, as he was then, and takes care so to sweeten Sufferings and Afflictions with his Love, that his Disciples find, by happy Experience, that as Afflictions abound, Con∣solations do much more abound.—And there∣fore these Objections, in stead of destroying, do only more enforce the Motives before urged to excite you to walk with God.—</P>
<P>But supposing the Objections were just, and Walkers with God were as despicable and un∣happy as you would represent them to be; yet I have a third Motive to offer, which, if weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, will over-weigh all Objections, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is a Heaven at the End of this Walk—For to use the Words of pious Bishop <HI>Beveridge,</HI> <Q>Tho' the Way be narrow, yet it is not long; and tho' the Gate be strait, yet it opens into everlasting Life</Q>—<HI>Enoch</HI> found it so—He walked with God on Earth, and God took him to sit down with him for ever in the Kingdom of Hea∣ven—Not that we are to expect to be taken away as he was—No—I suppose we shall all die the common Death of all Men—But after Death, the Spirits of those that have walked

<Q><HI>And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud Voice, Lazarus come forth. And he that was dead, came forth, bound Hand and Foot with Grave-cloaths: And his Face was bound about with a Napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</HI></Q>

<P>WHEN Jesus Christ, the Eternal Word, was pleased to make all Things by the Word of his Pow∣er, his last Works were the best—When he looked back upon, and beheld the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Products of his Almighty Power, he pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nced them <HI>good;</HI> but when that last, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ly Creature Man, was formed, he pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ed them <HI>very good</HI>—So likewise, the same

Jesus, when he came to tabernacle among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> us, and begin and carry on a new and second Creation, tho' all his Works were Miracles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wonder, and manifested forth the Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his eternal Godhead, yet the nearer he came to the End of his publick Ministrations, the greater and more noble did the Miracles which he wrought appear—The Resurrection of <HI>La∣zarus;</HI> that is to be the Subject of the follow∣ing Discourse, I think, is a sufficient Proof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this—To an Eye of Sense, it seems to be one of the greatest, if not the very greatest Mira∣cle of all which our blessed Lord performed When our Saviour bid <HI>John'</HI>s Disciples go and tell their Master what Things they had see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and heard, he commands them to inform him, that by his divine Power <HI>the Dead were raised;</HI> alluding no doubt to the Ruler's Daughter, who was raised immediately after her Decease; and the Widow's Son, who at the Com∣mand of Jesus, rose out of his Coffin, as they were carrying his Corpse to the Burial. These were pregnant Proofs that Jesus was indeed that Messiah that was to come into the World—But his raising of <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the Dead, after he had lain four Days dead, and stank, and saw Corruption, is still, if possible, a grea∣ter Miracle; and consequently, a stronger Proof of his being the Anointed, the Christ of God.—The Evangelist <HI>John</HI> is very parti∣cular in giving us an Account of this Miracle;
<PB N="131" REF="005885_0141_10275ED8017D1698"/>
even so particular, as to spend a whole Chap∣ter in relating the Circumstances which pre∣ceded, attended, and followed after it—And as he was undoubtedly directed herein by the all-wise, unerring Spirit of God, does it not point out unto us, that this Miracle with all its respective Circumstances, calls for our par∣ticular and most serious Meditation?—It ap∣pears to me in this Light; and therefore, as the Lord shall be pleased to assist me, I shall go back to the Beginning of this Chapter, follow the Evangelist Step by Step, and consi∣der the Particulars of this wondrous Miracle, make some practical Observations as I go along, and shut up all with some suitable Instructions and Exhortations which will naturally arise from the Body of the Discourse.—</P>
<P>The Evangelist in the first Verse, makes mention of the Sickness of <HI>Lazarus—Now,</HI> says he, <HI>a certain Man was sick, named Laza∣rus of Bethany, the Town of Mary, and her Sister Martha.</HI> Some think these Sisters were very wealthy, so as to own good Part of the Town; or as the original Word seems to im∣ply, the Village—But then it is probable the Evangelist wou'd have said the Town of <HI>La∣zarus,</HI> Estates usually descending, as with us, in the Male Line: It means therefore no more, than that <HI>Martha</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> lived in <HI>Bethany</HI>—The Holy Ghost pointing out to us hereby,
<PB N="132" REF="005885_0142_10275ED989298908"/>
that nothing makes a Town so worthy of gracious Soul's Remark or Esteem, as its hav∣ing many of God's dear Children for its Inha∣bitants!—<HI>Bethany,</HI> tho' a little Place, is more famous because it was the Town of <HI>Martha</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> than if <HI>Alexander</HI> had fought in it one of his greatest Battles—Both these Women loved Jesus in Sincerity, and were as good as they were great—But <HI>Mary,</HI> tho the younger Sister, seems to be most eminent—The Evangelist in the second Verse, speaks of her in a very distinguishing Manner—<HI>It was that Mary,</HI> that never-to-be-forgotten <HI>Mary, which anointed the Lord with Ointment</HI> (expen∣sive as it was) and wiped his Feet, after she had washed them with Tears of Love, <HI>with her Hair,</HI> even the Hair of her Head—What Notice is taken of this Action! With what an Eulogy, and in what a high Strain of Com∣mendation is it here spoken of? And such are the Honours of all God's Saints—Tho' all o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> good Works are not recorded as <HI>Mary's</HI> were, yet God is not unmindful that he should for∣get our Works of Faith and Labours, which have proceeded of Love—Every Tear we shed, every Sigh we fetch, every Alms we give, tho' it be only a Cup of cold Water, are all recor∣ded in the Lamb's Book of Remembrance, and shall be brought out to our eternal Ho∣nour, rewarded with a Reward of Grace, tho' not of Debt, at the great and terrible Day of
<PB N="133" REF="005885_0143_10275EDC69F24030"/>
the Lord—<HI>I was an hungred, and ye gave me Meat, I was thirsty, and ye gave me Drink, naked, and ye cloathed me, sick and in Prison, and ye came unto me.</HI>—What Reason have we then to <HI>be stedfast and unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord, for∣asmuch</HI> as we are assured, that <HI>our La∣bours will not be in vain or forgotten by the Lord? It was that Mary that anointed the Lord with Ointment, and wiped his Feet with her Hair</HI>—And what follows? <HI>Whose Brother Lazarus was sick</HI>—So that being re∣lated to Christ, or Christ's Disciples, will not exempt Persons from Sickness—In this Life, Time and Chance happen to all, only with this material Difference, <HI>viz.</HI> Those Afflicti∣ons, which harden the obstinately Impenitent, soften and purify the Heart of a true Believer. My Son, therefore despise not the Chastening of the Lord on one Hand, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him on the other—<HI>For whom the Lord loveth he Chastneth,</HI> and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth—Jesus loved <HI>Laza∣rus,</HI> and yet <HI>Lazarus</HI> was sick—And what do his Sisters do for him now he is sick? No doubt they applied to a Physician, for it is tempting God to neglect making use of Means for the Recovery of our Health, when it is impaired—But then they were not guilty of <HI>Asa'</HI>s Crime, who <HI>sought to the Physician, but not to the Lord</HI>—No! th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y knew the most
<PB N="134" REF="005885_0144_10275EDDF6227988"/>
skilful <HI>Recipes</HI> would be of no Effect, unless attended with a Blessing from Jesus the great and Almighty Physician; and <HI>Therefore</HI> (verse 3) <HI>his Sisters sent unto him,</HI> it should seem at the Beginning of their Brother's Illness—Alas how unlike is their Conduct to that of the Generality of People, especially the Rich and Great! How unfashionable is it Now-a-days, for Persons to send to Jesus in Behalf of their sick Relations! It is so very uncustomary, that in some Places, if a Minister be sent for to a sick Person, it is a sad Symptom that the Patient is almost past Hopes of Recovery—Thus did not <HI>Martha</HI> and her Sister <HI>Mary</HI>—They sent unto Jesus, tho' he was now <HI>beyond Jordan</HI> (Chap. x. 40) where <HI>he abode,</HI> or made his chief Place of Residence for some Time—Hence it was that they knew where to send to him—But what Kind of Message did they send? A very humble and suitable One—<HI>Lord,</HI> Verse 3. <HI>behold, he whom thou lovest is sick</HI>—They might have said, Lord he who loveth thee is sick—But they knew that our Love was not worth mentioning, and that we love Jesus only because he first loved us—Be∣sides here is no prescribing to our Lord what he shou'd do, or what Means he should make use of—They do not so much as say, we pray thee come, only speak the Word, and our sick Brother shall be restored—They only simply tell Jesus the Case, knowing it was
<PB N="135" REF="005885_0145_10275EE385839B18"/>
sufficient barely to lay it before an infinitely compassionate Redeemer, and leave it to him to act according to his own sovereign Good-Will and Pleasure—<HI>Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick</HI>—Oh how sweet is it when the Soul is brought to this! And with what a ho∣ly Confidence may we pray to, and intercede with the holy Jesus, when we have Reason to hope, that those we pray and intercede for, are Lovers of, and are beloved of <HI>Him!</HI> For his Eyes are in a peculiar Manner over the Righteous, and his Ears always open to their Prayers—This was their Message, and it soon reached Jesus Christ—And how does he re∣ceive it? We are told, Verse 4. <HI>For when Jesus heard that, viz.</HI> That he whom he lo∣ved was sick, <HI>He said this Sickness is not unto Death, but unto the Glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby</HI>—To whom these Words were spoken is not certain—In all Probability Jesus spake them to the Persons that deliver'd <HI>Martha'</HI>s and <HI>Mary'</HI>s Message—And if so, it was no Doubt a comfortable An∣swer for the present, tho' it must afterwards puzzle them as well as the Disciples how to explain it, when they found that <HI>Lazarus</HI> was actually dead. <HI>This Sickness is not unto Death, i. e.</HI> Not unto an <HI>abiding</HI> Death, be∣cause he intended to raise him again, soon af∣ter his Decease—It is like that other Expression of our Lord in St. <HI>Mark, The Damsel is not
<PB N="136" REF="005885_0146_10275EE669BD2A58"/>
dead, but sleepeth;</HI> which must not be under∣stood in a literal, but metaphorical Sense—And this and such like Instances, ought to teach us to weigh carefully our blessed Lord's Words, and to wait for an Explication of them, by subsequent Providences; otherwise we shall be in Danger of misapplying them, and thereby bring our Souls into unspeakable Bondage—<HI>This Sickness is not unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eath, but unto the Glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby</HI>—This is the End both of the Afflictions, and the Deaths of God's People—By all that happens to them, he will be glorified one Way or another, and cause every Thing to work together for their Good—And who then wou'd but be content to be sick, or willingly submit to Death itself, if so be the Son of God may be glorified thereby? This Answer no Doubt proceeded from Love—For we are told, Verse 5. that <HI>Jesus loved Martha and her Sister, and Lazarus</HI>—Oh happy Family! Three in it beloved of Jesus, with a peculiar, everlasting Love—<Q>Very of∣ten it so happens that</Q> to use the Words of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he pious Bishop <HI>Beveridge</HI> <Q>there is but one in a City, and two in a Country, of this Stamp</Q>—But here are two Sisters and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rother, all Lovers of, and beloved by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orious Jesus—What shall we say to these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings? Why, That our Saviour's Grace is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree and Sovereign, and he may do what he
<PB N="137" REF="005885_0147_10275EE8098E74F8"/>
will with his own—They who are thus so highly favoured, as to have so many converted in one House, ought to be doubly thankful! Such a Blessing have not all his Saints—No! Many, very many, go mourning over their perverse and graceless Relations, all their Lives long; and find even to their dying Day, that their greatest Foes are those of their own Houshold.—Surely these three Relations lived a Heaven upon Earth—For what can they want, what can make them miserable who are assured of Jesu's Love? But surely if Je∣sus loves this dear little Family, the next News one wou'd think we shou'd hear, would be, that he went immediatly and healed <HI>La∣zarus;</HI> or at least, cured him at a Distance—But instead of that, we are told, Verse 6. <HI>When he had heard that he was sick, he abode two Days still in the same Place where he was</HI>—A strange Way this, in the Eye of natural Reason, of expressing Love; but not so strange in the Eye of Faith—For the Lord Jesus very often sheweth his Love, by defer∣ring to give immediate Answers to our Prayers—For hereby he tries our Faith and Patience, and exercises all our passive Graces—We have a Proof of this in the <HI>Syrophenician</HI> Woman, upon whom the blessed Jesus frowned, and spake roughly too at first, only that he might afterwards turn unto her and say, <HI>O Woman, great is thy Faith</HI>—Let not those then that
<PB N="138" REF="005885_0148_10275EE99BAE3A38"/>
believe, make too much Haste; or immedi∣ately in their Hearts repine against the Lord, because he may not Answer their Requests, in their own Time and Way—God's Time and Way is best—And we shall find it to be so in the End—<HI>Martha</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> experienced the Truth of this, tho' undoubtedly our Lord's seeming Delay, to come and heal their Bro∣ther, cost them great Searchings of Heart—But will the Lord Jesus forget his dear <HI>Laza∣rus</HI> whom his Soul loveth? <HI>Can a Woman forget her sucking Child?</HI> Indeed she may; but the Lord never faileth those that fear him—Neither is he slack concerning his Promise, as some Men count Slackness—For his very Delays are Answers—The Vision is for an ap∣pointed Time—In the End it will speak and not lie.—Tho' our Lord abode two Days were he was, to try the Faith of these Sisters, yet after this, he said unto his Disci∣ples, Verse 7. <HI>Let us go into Judea again</HI>—With what a holy Familiarity does Jesus con∣verse with his dear Children! Our Saviour seems to speak to his Disciples, as tho' he was only their Brother, and as it were upon a Level with them; <HI>Let us go into Judea again.</HI> How gently, according to what was predicted of him, does he lead those that are with Young! Jesus very well knew the Weakness of his Disciples, and also what a dangerous Place <HI>Judea</HI> was: How gradually therefore
<PB N="139" REF="005885_0149_10275EEF40931840"/>
does he make known unto them, his Design of going thither! And how does he admit his Disciples to expostulate with him on this Ac∣count! <HI>Master, say they</HI> (Verse 8.) <HI>the Jews of late sought to Stone thee, and goest thou thither again?</HI> They were amazed at our Lord's Boldness, and were ready to call it Presumption. As we generally are prone to censure and condemn other zealous and enter∣prizing Persons, as carrying Matters too far, for no other Reason, if we examine the Bot∣tom of our Hearts, but because they go be∣fore, and excel ourselves.—The Disciples, no doubt, thought that they spoke out of Love to their Lord, and assuredly they did; but what a Deal of Self-love was there mixed and blen∣ded with it? They seem much concerned for their Master, but they were more concern∣ed for themselves—However Jesus overlooks their Weakness, and mildly replies, Verses 9, and 10. <HI>Are there not twelve Hours in the Day? If any Man walk in the Day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the Light of the World; but if any Man walk in the Night he stumbleth, because there is no Light in him.</HI> As tho' our Lord had said, <Q>My dear Disciples, I thank you for your Care and and Concern for me—<HI>Judea</HI> is a dangerous Place, and what you say of the Treatment I met with from its Inhabitants, is just and true; but be not afraid of going there up∣on

For the Lord Jesus will keep those whom he loves at his Foot, and dependent on him. <HI>Let us go unto him</HI>—He still speaks as tho they were his Equals—Oh that Christians in general, Oh that Ministers in particular, would learn of him their great Exemplar, to conde∣scend to Men of low Degree!

But I am more inclined to think that the Word <HI>Him,</HI> refers to Jesus his dear Master; and if so, he is so far from being blamed that he spake like a good Soldier of Jesus Christ—<HI>Let us also go, that we may die with him</HI>—<Q>If our dear Master will go into <HI>Judea,</HI> and hazard his precious Life, let us not any longer make such frivolous Excuses,

It may be the News was brought only privately to <HI>Martha</HI> (for it is plain from Verse 31st, that the <HI>Jews</HI> who were in the House knew not of it;) and <HI>Martha</HI> knowing how our Lord had chid her once, was resolved he should have no Reason on the same Account to chide her any more; there∣fore when the News were brought, she would not so much as stay to inform her Sister, but went out to see whether the News were true or not, and if so, as the eldest Sister, she wou'd invite the blessed Jesus in—How hap∣py is it, when Christ's Reproofs for past Ne∣glects, excites our future Zeal to come out and meet him!

How often does the Enmity of our desperately wicked Hearts rise against Christ, when we are under the afflicting Hand of his Providence! Are not the very best of us frequently tempted in such Circumstances, to say within our selves at least, Why does God thus cruelly deal with us?

Because we shall find by and by, that she did believe that our Lord was the Son of God, and that Messiah which was come into the World—Therefore when she said she knew that whatsoever he ask'd of God, God would give it to him, she may be understood as re∣ferring to God the Father, under whom the Lord Jesus acted as Mediator, tho' equal to him in respect to his eternal Glory and God∣head—This Mystery we may well suppose her acquainted with, because Jesus had been fre∣quently preaching at her House, and conse∣quently, had no doubt opened that Mystery unto her—O what a blessed Thing must it be to have such a Mediator!

But alas, tho' all were affected, yet it seems, all were not well af∣fected at seeing Jesus weep!—For we are told, Verse 37th, that some of them said, <HI>Could not this Man which opened the Eyes of the Blind, have caused that even this Man should not have died?</HI> One wou'd imagine that Satan himself could scarce have utter'd a more perverse Speech. Every Word is full of Spite and Rancour—Could not this Man, this Fel∣low, this Deceiver, who pretends to say, that he opened the Eyes of the Blind, have caused that this Man, that he seems to love so, should not have died? Is not this a sufficient Proof that he is a Cheat? Have we catched him at last? Is it likely that he really helped others, when he could not help his own Friend? Oh how patient ought the Servants of our Lord to be! And how may they ex∣pect to be censured, and have their good Deeds questioned, and lessened, when their blessed Master has been thus treated before them! However Jesus will do Good, notwithstand∣ing all these Slights put upon him; and there∣fore again <HI>groaning in himself,</HI> Verse 38th, he

How naturally do we fall into Doubts and Fears, when we have not our Eye sin∣cerely directed to the blessed Jesus! <HI>Martha,</HI> instead of looking up to him, looks down in∣to the Grave, and poring upon her Brother's stinking Corpse, falls into a Fit of Unbelief—By this Time he <HI>stinketh,</HI> and therefore a Sight of him will only be offensive—For, perhaps, she might think our Lord only wanted just to take a View of her Brother <HI>Lazarus</HI>—Jesus therefore, to give her yet a further Hint, that he intended to do something extraordinary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith unto her, Verse 40th, <HI>Said I not unto thee, that if thou shouldst believe, thou shouldst see thee Glory of God?</HI> Our Lord speaks here with some Degree of Warmth—For nothing displeases him more than the Unbelief of his

own Disciples—<HI>Said I not unto thee, if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the Glory of God?</HI> When Christ spoke these Words unto her, we are not told—It might be, this was Part of their Conversation upon some other Oc∣casion some Time before—However he checks her openly for her Unbelief now—For those whom Jesus loves must expect to be rebuked sharply by him, whenever they Dishonour him by Unbelief—The Reproof is taken—Without making any more Objections, <HI>They</HI> Verse 41. <HI>took away the Stone from the Place where the Dead was laid;</HI> And now behold with what Solemnity the holy Jesus prepares himself to execute his gracious Design! <HI>And Jesus,</HI> Verse 41<HI>st, lift up his Eyes, and said, Father I thank thee that thou hast heard me—And I knew,</HI> Verse 42d, <HI>that thou hearest me always: But because of the People which stand by, I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</HI> Who can express with what Fervour and Intenseness of Spirit, our glorious High-Priest uttered these Words! They are a Thanksgiving arising from an Assurance that his Father had heard him—For Christ as Me∣diator was inferiour to the Father—<HI>I knew that thou hearest me always</HI> (and so may every Believer in his Degree say too) <HI>But because of the People which stand by I said it</HI>—Said what? We do not hear that Jesus said any Thing by Way of Prayer before—And that is true, if we

Grave-cloaths; and his Face was bound about with a Napkin.</HI> What a Sight was here! Methinks I see Surprize sit upon each Specta∣tor's Face—As the Body rises, their Wonder rises too—See how they Gaze! See how their Looks bespeak the Language of astonished Hearts; and all with a Kind of silent, but ex∣pressive Oratory, ready to say, What Manner of Man is this? Surely this is the Messiah that was to come into the World. How did the Hearts of <HI>Martha</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> as we may very well suppose, leap for Joy! How were they now ashamed of themselves, for charging Je∣sus foolishly, and taxing him with Unkind∣ness, for not coming to prevent their Brother's dying! It is true Christ suffered him to die, but behold he is now alive again! For Jesus never denies us one Thing, but he intends to give us something better in the Stead of it.—Think you not that <HI>Martha</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> were now the most officious to <HI>obey</HI> our blessed Lord's Command, <HI>viz, Loose him and let him go?</HI> That same Power that raised <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the Dead, might have also taken off the Grave-cloaths from him—But Jesus Christ ne∣ver did, and never will work a needless Mira∣cle: Others could unloose his Grave-cloaths, but Jesus alone cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d unloose the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds of Death.—And now perhaps some may be ready to ask, what News hath <HI>Lazarus</HI> brought from the other World? But stop, O Man,

thy vain Curiosity! It is forbidden, and therefore useless Knowledge—The Scriptures are silent concerning it—Why shou'd we desire to be wise above what is written? It becomes us rather to be wholly employed in adoring the gracious Hand of that gracious Redeem∣er who raised him from the Dead, and to see (now we have heard the History) what Improvement we can make of such a remark∣able and instructive Transaction—Would to God, that my preaching upon this Resurrecti∣on of <HI>Lazarus</HI> To-day, may have the same blessed Effects upon you, as the Sight of it had upon some of the Standers-by—For we are told, Verse 45th, <HI>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the Things which Jesus did, believed on him</HI>—A profitable Visit this! The Best no Doubt that they ever paid in their Lives—And this was in Answer to our Saviour's Prayer, <HI>but because of the People that stand by, I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</HI> And one wou'd imagine, that all who saw this Miracle, were induced, thereby, really to believe on him—But alas! I could almost say, that I could tell you of a greater Miracle, than raising <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the Dead—And what is that? Why, that some of these very Persons who were on the Spot, instead of believing on him, <HI>went their Way,</HI> Verse 46th, <HI>to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done</HI>—And this
<PB N="163" REF="005885_0173_10275F37DD7E79E0"/>
was so far from convincing them, that it only excited their Envy, stirred up the whole Hell of their Self-righteous Hearts, and made them, from that Day forward, Verse 53, <HI>take Counsel to∣gether,</HI> to execute what they had long before designed, I mean, put the innocent Jesus to death—See how busy they are, Verse 47th, <HI>Then gathered the Chief Priests and the Pharisees a Council, and said, What do we? For this Man doeth many Miracles</HI>—Envy itself it seems could not deny that—And need they say then, <HI>What do we,</HI> or what shou'd we do? Believe on to be sure, and submit to him; take up the Cross, and follow him. No, on the Con∣trary say they, Verse 48th, <HI>If we let him thus alone</HI> (which they would not have done so long, had not God put a Hook in the Levia∣than's Jaws) <HI>all Men will believe on him</HI>—And suppose they did? Then all Men would be blessed indeed, and have a Title to true Happiness—No, say they, <HI>then the Romans shall come, and take away both our Place and Nation</HI>—But were not the <HI>Romans</HI> come al∣ready? Were they not at this Time Tributa∣ries to <HI>Caesar?</HI> But they were afraid of the Church as well as the State—<HI>They will come and take away our Place, i. e.</HI> our Place of Worship, and consequently they look upon Jesus Christ and his Proceedings, and Adhe∣rents, as dangerous both to Church and State—This hath been always the Method of Phari∣sees

and High-Priests, when they have been taking Counsel against the Lord Jesus, and his dear anointed Ones—But they need not have been afraid on this Account—For our Saviour's Kingdom neither was, nor is of this World; and the only Way to have preserved their Place and Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, was to countenance, and as much as in them lay, to have caused all to be∣lieve on Jesus—How miserably were they o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in their Politicks! The Death of Jesus, which they thought would save, was the grand Cause of the utter Destruction both of their Place and Nation—And so will all Politicks formed against Christ and his Gospel end at last in the De∣struction of those that contrived them—But Oh the desperate Wickedness and Treachery of Man's deceitful Heart! Where are the Scribes, where are the Infidels, where are the Letter-learned Disputers of this World, who are daily calling for a Repetition of Miracles, in order to confirm and evidence the Truth of the Christian Religion? Surely if they be∣lieve not <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets, neither would they believe, though one rose from the Dead—Here was one raised from the Dead before many Witnesses, and yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those Witnesses did by no Means believe on Jesus—For divine Faith is not wrought in the Heart by moral Persuasion (tho' moral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣suasion is very often made use of as a Means to convey it—) Faith is the peculiar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of

God—No one can come to Jesus unless the Father draw him—And therefore, that I may draw near the Close of this Discourse, let me shut up all with a Word of Exhortation.—Come then, ye dead, Christless, unconverted Sinners, come and see the Place where they laid the Body of deceased <HI>Lazarus</HI>—Behold him dead and laid out, bound Hand and Foot with Grave-cloaths, lock'd up and stinking in a dark Cave, with a great Stone placed on the Top of it!—View him again and again—Go nearer to him—Be not afraid—Smell him, and see how he stinketh—Stop there now, and pause a while; and whilst thou art gazing, O Man, upon the Corpse of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> give me leave to tell thee with great Plainness, but greater Love, that this dead, bound, entombed, stink∣ing Carcase, is but a faint Representation of thy poor Soul in its natural State—For whether thou believest it or not, thy Spirit which thou bearest about with thee, sepulchred in Flesh and Blood, is as literally dead to God, and as truly dead in Trespasses and Sins, as the Body of <HI>Lazarus</HI> was in the Cave—Was he bound Hand and Foot with Grave-cloaths? So art thou bound Hand and Foot with thy Corrup∣tions—And as a Stone was laid on the Sepul∣chre, so is there a Stone of Unbelief laid upon thy stupid Heart—Perhaps thou hast lain in this State, not only four Days, but many Years, stinking in God's Nostrils!—And what
<PB N="166" REF="005885_0176_10275F452D6F60D0"/>
is still more affecting, thou art just as unable to raise thy self out of this loathsome, dead State, to a Life of Righteousness and true Ho∣liness, as ever <HI>Lazarus</HI> was to raise himself from the Cave in which he lay so long—Thou mayest try the Power of thy own boasted Free-Will, and the Force and Energy of Moral Per∣suasion and rational Arguments (which, with∣out all Doubt, have their proper Place in Re∣ligion) but all thy Efforts, exerted with never so much Vigour, will prove quite fruitless and abortive, till that same Jesus who said, <HI>take away the Stone,</HI> and cried, <HI>Lazarns come forth,</HI> comes by his mighty Power, removes the Stone of Unbelief, speaks Life into thy dead Soul, looses thee from the Fetters of thy Sins and cor∣ruptions, and by the Influences of his blessed Spirit, enables thee to go and walk in the Way of his holy <HI>Commandments</HI>—And Oh that he wou'd now rend the Heavens, and come down amongst you! Oh that there may be a Stirring among the dry Bones this Day! Oh that whilst I am speaking and saying, <HI>dead Sinners, come forth,</HI> a Power, even an Almighty Power, might accompany the Word, and cause you to emerge and awaken into new Life! And if the Lord shou'd vouchsafe me such a Mercy, and but one single Soul in this great Congregation, should arise and shake himself from the Dust of his natural State, I think, according to the present Frame of

For, methinks, Death in some Respects is more tolerable, than to see poor Sinners Day by Day lying sepulchred dead and stinking in Sin! Oh that you saw how loathsome you are in the Sight of God, whilst you continue in your natural State! I believe you wou'd not so con∣tentedly hug your Chains, and refuse to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et at liberty—Methinks I see some of you affected at this Part of my Discourse—What say you? Are there not some here ready to complain, alas, we have some Relations pre∣sent, who are so notoriously wicked, that they not only hug their Chains, but make a Mock of Sin, and stink not only in the Sight of God, but Man—Dear Hearts! you are ready to urge this, as a Reason why Jesus will not raise them, and think it hard, perhaps, that Jesus does not come, in answer to your re∣peated Groans and Prayers, to convert and save them—But what Jesus said unto <HI>Martha,</HI> I say unto you—<HI>Believe, and you shall yet see the Glory of God</HI>—Look not down so much, nor think it a Thing incredible, that God should raise their dead Souls—Oh think not hard of Jesus for delaying an Answer to your Prayers—Assure yourselves he heareth you al∣ways—And who knows but this Day Jesus
