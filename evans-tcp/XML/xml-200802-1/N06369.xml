<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>RUE Sobriety of Mind aims at seeing God and his Glories, in the whole Frame and Course of Nature, as well as in the Wonders of his Grace. It leads Individuals to sanctify their secu∣lar Business, by ever considering them∣selves as his Servants; and Numbers combined in any Profession, to recognize their Dependance on him, at the more solemn Periods of their exerting, their na∣tural and artificial Improvements in such Professions, by accompanying them with Acts of Devotion.</P>
<P>THE sacred Offices we are now engaged in, are therefore founded in Wisdom, in that <HI>Fear of the Lord</HI> which <HI>is the Beginning of Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>MANY are the religious Reflections relative to the Occasion of this Day, of which Times of Tranquillity give us a Choice indifferently; but when we are sur∣rounded with all the Horrors of War, and dejected by a Train of past ill Successes in it; when we are appa∣rently at the Eve of those important Events, whereon our Peace, our Liberty our Being depend: We have
<PB N="6" REF="008079_0004_102FD18F88190368"/>
Need to arm our selves with those divine Principles, which shall prevent an anxious Gloom of Mind from degenerating into repining Doubts of the Rectitude or Kindness of the Administrations of Heaven, and shall chear our Spirits with the Hopes of happier Days, and fix our Trust on a sure Foundation.</P>
<P>TO this End I have chosen the Part of Holy Scrip∣ture now read; wherein the Prophet rapt into future Time, comforts the People he wrote to, yea and Man∣kind in general, subjected to various Miseries through Ignorance and Vice; represented as an undutiful Wife, removed from the Bed and Board of her Lord, <HI>deserted, afflicted, tossed with Tempests,</HI> &amp;c. as in our Context, afterward restored to Favour, becoming the Mother of a numerous Offspring, having the Pleasure of seeing them established in a noble Habitation, surrounded with every Blessing which can render Life comfortable or desirable. Under which Allegory is designed, the unhappy State of Mankind in general for many Ages, and the glorious Effect of the Advent of the Son of God, and of the Propagation of his Religion.</P>
<P>TO confirm Faith, and inspire Hope of these happy Futurities, it was needful that Men should renounce the absurd Principle, which anciently much prevailed, and seems to be divers Times pointed at by the Pro∣phets, viz. Of two independent Principles, or first Cau∣ses, of Good and Evil in the Fates of Men. Which the Prophet here does, when he asserts the supreme Dominion of God, in those Events, which used to be attributed to the evil Power. <HI>Behold I have created,</HI> &amp;c.
<Q>Instruments of War, their Fabric, Use and Success, and the Hands they are put into, are all under my Inspection and Direction, you may therefore confide in my Promise of Deliverance from Evil, and of every Blessing in due Time.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008079_0005_102FD19211F06070"/>OUR Text then may be esteemed a Description of the Administrations of Him, whose <HI>Throne is established in the Heavens, and whose Kingdom ruleth over All;</HI> and in Consequence a Vindication of the Ways of God to Men, and an Intimation of that extensive Plan of the most High, the Parts of which shall gradually take Place, improving in or tending toward Perfection, 'till the Consummation of all Things; after which Pe∣riod, the Review of them, shall fix the Attention, and raise the Admiration and Praises of Saints and Angels in that blest State, where they shall <HI>sing the Song of Moses the Servant of God and the Song of the Lamb; saying, Great and marvellous are thy Works, Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy Ways, thou King of Saints; Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify thy Name, for Thou only art Holy?</HI></P>
<P>IN the following Discourse we may,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. REFLECT upon the present State of Mankind respecting Wars, by itself considered.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. AS Part of a Plan, or connected Series of the divine Proceedure, tending gradually to a Perfec∣tion worthy of its Author.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FIRST, Let us consider the present Condition of Mankind respecting Wars, by itself considered, as of the Constitution of God, answering Purposes worthy of his Government.</P>
<P>I SAY by itself considered; because we are not to suppose that infinite Power and Wisdom, can be re∣duced to a Necessity of using Means, unjust or cruel in their Nature, to bring about Ends of Good. <HI>The Judge of all the Earth will do Right.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008079_0006_102FD19599E1C350"/>THERE have been in all Ages, those who desired to be Atheists. Men, who when the Terrors of divine Justice attacked them, have applyed to Infidelity, to get rid of the Fears of the Reward due to their evil Deeds. In St. Peter's Days there were <HI>Scoffers, walk∣ing after their own Lusts, who tauntingly said, Where is the Promise of his Coming?</HI> Others since that Time, have from the same Motive, viewed the Works of God in an untoward Light, and insolently said,
<Q>Where is the righteous and good Government of God? while Man his Creature, his Offspring, is doomed from a weak and helpless Infancy, to a Series of Vexation, to all the Miseries which unhallowed Violence can inflict? Is this his World? this Aceldama, covered with Garments rolled in Blood, filled with the Cries of murdered Innocents, the Plaints of ravished Virgins.</Q></P>
<P>OR if such Charges have been too unpopular for Reputation, or too hard of Digestion even for them∣selves, the same Motives have put them upon Endea∣vours to confound their own and others Conceptions of God and his Attributes; for if this can be done, the same End is answered. That God, whose Attributes Men have no Idea of, is neither an Object of their Hopes nor Fears. Hence adopting the abovementioned exaggerated Descriptions, they have said,
<Q>Disorder and Misery are propagated thro' all the Creation; and yet, <HI>All that is, is Right.</HI> God governs the World. The Inference therefore is, That Wisdom, Goodness, Justice, are quite different Properties when attributed to God, from what they are in Men. We know not what to expect from him, <HI>Soul take thine Ease.</HI></Q></P>
<P>VICIOUS Men make the most of these Difficulties▪ sober Minds have been perplexed about them, and
<PB N="9" REF="008079_0007_102FD197D6D17DE0"/>
ready to say with one of the Ancients, <HI>When I tho't to know this, it was too hard for me,</HI> but as he adds, <HI>till I went into the Sanctuary of God,</HI> so they have found Retirement for religious Meditation and Appli∣cation to the Word of God, the best Relief.</P>
<P>INDEED that future World which the human Soul perceives itself to be made for, and in which the Ora∣cles of Truth assure us, all present Inequalities shall be adjusted, the Sufferings of the innocent and pious infinitely more than made up, vindicates the Character of Equity and Goodness in the Supreme. But yet as we are to judge, that all his Perfections are exerted in a Consistency with each other at all Times, 'tis a noble Improvement of the Mind, tending to the Honour of God, and our Ad∣vantage, to examine, what Proportion appears to us in the divine Conduct here, what Ends worthy of him are answered in the Course of Things, how false the Sug∣gestions abovementioned are.</P>
<P>A SHORT Answer has been given to them by some: that the first Man by his first Sin, put himself out of the Protection of God, so that the World was justly de<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ted by him, to be a confused State of Woe, which beginning here, shall be continued for ever, except so far as Grace relieves a happy few.</P>
<P>BUT Others have thought this to be rather a cut∣ting the Knot than untying it. For besides the Im∣propriety of Language, in speaking of Beings coming into Existence in a State of Punishment, which State implies previous Ill-desert, and to which Condition of Ill-desert none can be reduced by Causes with Respect to which they are purely passive, (so that all Expres∣sions of that Sort must have a liberal Construction;) besides this I say they observe that it is more agreable
<PB N="10" REF="008079_0008_102FD19A14261C90"/>
to the Word of God, as they think it more honour∣able to him to conceive of him as the universal Father, who in this World tempers the Severity of a Judge, with the Tenderness of a Parent.</P>
<P>AND in such a Light, however vain Men may ima∣gine, that this Part of the System of the Universe, is not arranged in such a Manner as they should have dis∣posed of it; yet humble Observers will see enough to glorify and adore him, who is <HI>glorious in Holiness, fear∣ful in Praises, doing Wonders.</HI></P>
<P>THAT Men are free and voluntary Agents, conscious of Right and Wrong in their Temper and Conduct, the Subjects of moral Government, our own Experience and inward Sensation so convince us, that all metaphy∣sical Arguments to the contrary, must appear to the Tho'tful, but idle and ridiculous Sophisms. Now 'tis incident to such Beings of limited Capacities, to fall into Imprudence and Vice. What then is it to be ex∣pected, will be the Course of the Care and Govern∣ment of God respecting such? Surely that while faith∣ful to God, they shall in general enjoy his Smiles. (I say in general, because there may be Exceptions, among other wise Reasons, to convince us of the Certainty of the future World) Such, Revelation informs us, was the State of Innocence in the Garden of Eden, and such shall be that of the <HI>heavenly Jerusalem, the City of the great King.</HI> And on the other Hand, that when they offend, they shall find it an <HI>evil Thing and a bit∣ter;</HI> That Departure from God, is Departure from all Good.</P>
<P>IN such a State of Things, Wisdom, Justice, Good∣ness, illustriously appear. If the Effect of different Conduct be proportionable, if Misery follow Wicked∣ness
<PB N="11" REF="008079_0009_102FD19BA5A1ED28"/>
as its Shadow, or rather as it's evil Genius▪ and if the <HI>Work of Righteousness be Peace, and the Effect of Righteousness, Quietness and Assurance for ever.</HI></P>
<P>THE Almighty Possessor of these Perfections, is yet more glorious, if these Troubles, these natural Punish∣ments, which end in the Ruin of the obstinate and abandoned, prove the Medicine and Cure of those who are meet for such a Favour, moving them to return to due Obedience; and so all Events of the natural and moral Kind unite in a Tendency to Good, by Way of Motive or Example.</P>
<P>See here then the Finger of God in the Fate of So∣cieties, (for I shall confine myself to them, though the Case of particular Persons be nearly the same) accord∣ing to their Conduct.</P>
<P>WHEN a Community in general, forsakes God and Virtue, they fall into those Errors and Sins, which ei∣ther draw upon them the just Resentments of their Neighbours, or invite some hardy Invader to attack them. The Alarm is given, but what is to be expected, from a People enervated by Luxury, or drenched in sensual Defilements, equally lost to publick Spirit and the Fear of God? What I say is to be expected but— base Terror—Feebleness and Disunion in public Coun∣cils—sordid Venality in those entrusted with the Exe∣cution of them—In the Camp abandoned Profligacy, which takes away the Heart—in the Field dastardly Cowardice? Despairing of themselves, not daring to look up to God; <HI>if they call, who will answer them, and to which of the Saints will they turn?</HI> They must shamefully disgorge ill-gotten Possessions, or bow their Necks to the Yoke. The same evil Temper which affronts God, disregards the Rights of Men. If what
<PB N="12" REF="008079_0010_102FD19DE404A848"/>
they feel amends them not, they go on to new Acts of Injustice, Breaches of Treaties or other Outrages, which provoke their Neighbours to the utmost Extremities, the most shocking Desolations follow, 'till their Names be no more on Earth.</P>
<P>HERE is the righteous Severity of God. For who will blame Heaven for those Sufferings, which Men by forsaking the natural Means of Prosperity, bring on themselves? God is glorified, when all about them are delivered from the Contagion of their evil Exam∣ple, and warned by their Fate to abandon Iniquity; thus <HI>Sin is the Reproach</HI> and Ruin of <HI>any People.</HI> And if wise Ends are served by such general Cala∣mities, the few innocent Individuals may be safely left in his Hands, most able to cause them soon to forget the Troubles, of this small Part of their Existence.</P>
<P>THIS is one Issue of such Distresses. Let us take another View.</P>
<P>IF a People thus visited, <HI>open</HI> their Eyes and <HI>Ears to Discipline,</HI> if they <HI>return to him that smiteth them;</HI> every Step of their Return to Virtue, furnishes them with Principles of successful Resistance; human and divine Aids flow in, for the Restoration of their Tranquillity.</P>
<P>For a religious Nation, have their Portion in this World of Imperfection and Sin, are sometimes called to defend themselves against the Sons of Violence, or ward off their ill Designs. The <HI>Fear of the Lord</HI> will <HI>be their strong Tower.</HI> The Spirit of Piety will spread its Influence, on all Orders and Degrees.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="008079_0011_102FD1A020DA2030"/>THE governing Part of such a Society, considering themselves as under the Inspection of the one Judge, and his <HI>Ministers for Good</HI> to the People, will not wantonly or unjustly rush into Quarrels. The Go∣verned having Confidence in their Rulers, and their common Sense approving their Conduct, will with a chearful and vigorous Spirit, render their necessary Measures of this Sort effectual, by contributing freely of their Estates, or by personal Services. Public Measures will be founded in Justice, and be the Result of Deliberation, such as they can commend to God, and their Dependance on God will limit them to such as will in the long Run be most effectual.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY will such a People, have a high Ad∣vantage, as the same Spirit of Religion will possess their Soldiery.</P>
<P>THE religious Soldier, is inspired to Diligence in accomplishing himself in the Art of War, not by the Hope of a Plume of Feathers, not by the tinsel Ambition of wearing a Commission; much less by the sordid Prospect of six Pence a Day, or the brutal Love of Plunder and Blood: But that he may be an Instrument in the Hand of God, of <HI>breaking the Teeth of the Oppressor, and plucking the Spoil out of his Mouth,</HI> of maintaining Right, restoring Peace and spreading Happiness all around him.</P>
<P>THIS Spirit of Religion will render a Camp, a well ordered Family, a House of God formed for his Praise. Officers will imitate the supreme Ruler in Justice tempered with Meekness and Benignity, at∣tracting the Love and Confidence of all under Com∣mand, so that they will <HI>dare</HI> and choose to die with them, and for them. Councils of War, will be ma∣naged,
<PB N="14" REF="008079_0012_102FD1A358B977C0"/>
with Dependance on the Source of Wisdom and Courage, at whose Tribunal every Vote is to be ac∣counted for. Neither their Troops nor Country, will be sacrificed to the gay Humours of a Bottle; much less will they wast away the Property, and sell the Lives and Liberties of their Brethren, for the paltry Consideration of keeping themselves in Pay; the Con∣sequence of which will be, slow Motions—inactive Campaigns—Surprizes and Disgrace. The Ancients placed Men of such a Cast, deep in Hell. <HI>Vendidit hic Auro Patriam.</HI></P>
<P>PRIVATE Men, under the Influence of a Spirit of Piety, will be submissive to Superiors, not only for Wrath, but Conscience Sake; they will apply them∣selves to every Part of Duty, as called thereto by God; they will amidst the Duty of their Place, still remember that there is One <HI>higher than the Highest</HI> on Earth, to whom they are at the same Time to be faithful; and therefore by devout Meditation, and living as under the Inspection of Heaven, they will be spirited to Care and Diligence, and when summon∣ed to Arms will have no dead Weight to depress them. Religious Temperance strings the Nerves; gives Strength and Firmness to the Body, and maintains an equal uniform Presence of Mind, in every Emergency.</P>
<P>BUT never is this divine Principle of all that is good, more necessary or more advantageous, than in the Field of Battle, when Death presents itself in all its Terrors; then to be able to say, my Cause is good, approved of Heaven; in hazarding my Life for the present Happiness of my Friends and Country, I follow him, who gave up his precious Life for the future Happiness of all Mankind: Nor am I going to contend with giddy Chance or sullen Fate; the
<PB N="15" REF="008079_0013_102FD1A533343338"/>
Ruler of the World is the Arbiter, he presides over the Field of Battle; <HI>The Eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the Earth, to shew himself strong in Behalf of them whose Heart is perfect toward him;</HI> the Fate of Armies is decided by infinite Wisdom; if I die, 'tis to lie down in the Bed of Honour, and <HI>my Flesh shall rest in Hope;</HI> And what is Death, but a Step into the calm Regions of everlasting Peace? God is my Friend, Jesus my Saviour was <HI>made perfect through Sufferings,</HI> and I press on with Confidence, that if I breath my last in the Field, <HI>this Day</HI> my Soul <HI>shall be with</HI> him <HI>in Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>WITH what a different Spirit will such an One fight, from those abandoned Souls, who shall be alarmed, in the Revels of a drunken Debauch; sum∣moned from the unmanly Pollutions of a Harlot's Lap; or while blasphemous Oaths are on their Tongues; to face an Enemy, yea the last Enemy; with what Stupidity, or Dread of falling into the Hands of the living God?</P>
<P>NOR am I describing an imaginary Influence, but what the Experience of all Ages may testify. For if Enthusiasm, a supposed Cause of God, or feigned Sto∣ries of Intercourse with him, have rendered Armies, ir∣resistible; if vague and unmeaning Prodigies, fancied Symptoms of divine Displeasure, have palled the Cou∣rage: How much more shall substantial Guilt, disarm the Soul, and Hope toward God, raise the Spirits, and pave the Way to Victory?</P>
<P>THUS the Spirit of Religion and Virtue, in its Effects, naturally tends to Success; to make a People respect∣ed and feared; and so to settle their Security on a sta∣ble Foundation, except Imprudence, Rashness or Want
<PB N="16" REF="008079_0014_102FD1A770AC4FD8"/>
of Care, (which natural Infirmities of Men, even Reli∣gion does not entirely cure,) prevent.</P>
<P>THERE is one Case more remains to be considered; and that is, where contending Parties are in moral Regards on a Par, alike earthly, sensual, destitute of the Principles of Religion.</P>
<P>AND who shall find Fault, if a righteous God has so ordered Things, as that by ungodly Passions, they plague and harrass each other; and <HI>bite and devour</HI> 'till they waste their Treasures and Strength, mutually spreading Poverty and Desolation, 'till they <HI>be consumed of one another,</HI> and become public Examples, of the destructive Tendency of ungoverned Passions, or being worn out, at last give Peace, to the quiet in the Earth, or are by Distresses led to a better Mind. Or if one Party should much prevail, yet the Spirit of Impiety will carry them on, either to those Acts of Inhuma∣nity, which might stir up a conquered Enemy, to that Rage of Despair, which sometimes carries all before it; or Power, Plenty and Peace will lead them to that Licentiousness and vicious Indulgence, which prepares them for a Reverse of Condition, and carries them on swift to Destruction.</P>
<P>Such as I have pointed out, is in general the Con∣dition of human Affairs, as the wise God has been pleased to establish the Series of Causes and Effects. And if to this be added, that special Interposition of his Providence in great Exigencies, which Reason and Revelation teach us to expect, and which many me∣morable Events of past Times are hardly otherwise to be accounted for; in bringing formidable deep-laid De∣signs to nought, in Ways unlooked for; in the pros∣perous Successes of Handfulls of Men, when contend∣ing
<PB N="17" REF="008079_0015_102FD1AA5EA41DC0"/>
under his Auspices, and animated by the Principles of Godliness; if a careful Observer should collect in∣stances of this Sort, from the Conquest of Canaan, to Facts of a recent Date; I say if we take such special Appearances into the Account; we shall see Reason to <HI>praise, extol and honour the King of Heaven, all whose Works are Truth, and his Ways Judgment; and those that walk in Pride he is able to abase.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN therefore such is the State of Things, that in the general, Vice shall bring its own Punishment, Virtue its own Reward; Afflictions shall soften the Heart, and mend the Manners, or obstinate Wickedness shall ex∣terminate itself, and free the World from its Contagion; when Examples shall be set up from Time to Time, of these different Kinds, for the Caution or Encou∣ragement of those that come after; every one must own that the present Condition of Men is so proporti∣oned, as to be productive of Good and Happiness on the Whole: Nor could any Man say, were he not taught it from above, that this Discipline, these Cor∣rections of a heavenly Father, these Sentences of a righteous Judge thus executed, were not formed to produce the highest possible Good.</P>
<P>BUT how glorious does the Fountain of Wisdom and Benevolence appear, if the present State of Things be but one Step in the progressive Scheme of Happi∣ness, for which he has designed this World, in its vari∣ous Ages? And to this we proceed now to apply our Thoughts. I say,</P>
<P N="2">II. WE are to reflect on the present State of Man∣kind respecting War, as Part of a Plan, or connected Series of the Administrations of God, tending gradu∣ally to a Perfection, worthy of its Author.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="008079_0016_102FD1AC9C78AE58"/>A THOUGHTFUL Mind will have a proper Sense of his own Imperfection, especially how soon and utterly he is lost, when he contemplates Infinity, and the Works of the incomprehensible God. And yet as the Psalmist says, <HI>Whoso is wise</HI> and observant, will see the Perfec∣tions of God, tho' he cannot comprehend them. When the Question is started, Why if God be infinitely Good, are there Degrees of Perfection in his Works? Why did not omnipotent Benevolence make all his Works, in the most perfect State of Happiness, and at all Times invariably fixed in it? Beyond the Answer, which Modesty and Humility are content with, viz. That the Wisdom of God is unsearchable; besides this it may not be irreverent to observe, That we may be mistaken in supposing that the greatest Quantity of Happiness, would be enjoyed in the Universe collec∣tively, if the Creatures of God were so created and confirmed.</P>
<P>FOR as to the divers Ranks of created Beings, our Speculations may be in some Measure just, when we conceive, that as in Philosophy, one infinite Solid is in∣finitely greater than another; so the whole Sum of Happiness, communicated to Angels, Men and all the Creatures of God, is infinitely greater, than could pos∣sibly have been possessed, by an infinite Number of the highest Seraphim which surround the Throne of God, had all Degrees of Perfection below them been left a Blank. This Tho't abstruse indeed and inconclusive, I mention, only for the Sake of inferring, that when Men give themselves Licence, to accuse the Creator of penuriously dispensing Happiness, they go upon uncertain Grounds, and are very incompetent Judges, in the Matter.</P>
<P>IN like Manner, if curious Minds, when they hear of a Gradation of the same Species of Works of God,
<PB N="19" REF="008079_0017_102FD1AE53CF03B0"/>
at different Times toward Perfection, of the same or different Individuals, wonder why immense Love did not put them (Men for Instance) at once into that State of Happiness which they hope to arrive to: Tis sufficient to say, that we cannot tell that the whole Sum of the Happiness of our Race had been encreased thereby▪ Nor can we affirm, but that every finite reasonable Nature, is made happy, by Activity, and that Activity preserved by having Objects in View to pursue, by Hope, by the Approach of joyful Scenes, by surmounting Difficulties, by escaping Dangers, by possessing Happiness as the Prize of Labour, by compar∣ing their different Situations at different Times, and the Consciousness that they have something further to attain.</P>
<P>THESE Things being premised, let it be observed, That from what was said under the former Head, it may appear, that there is a Tendency in Religion (tho' there may be accidental Obstructions) to Success in Wars, by Means of that public Spirit, Union in Councils, due Subordination and its Duties, Tempe∣rance, Prudence, Courage, which it lays the Foundation of. Now if such a righteous Nation in their necessary Self-defence, should conquer and extend themselves, obstinate Enemies would be exterminated, their con∣spicuous Victories would attract the Eyes of all around them, convince them that God was with them; lead them thro' Fear or Love to be at Peace with them. Their Moderation in Successes, their Justice and Hu∣manity, would conciliate Friends, strengthen Alliances, and propagate the Spirit of Religion. I with Pleasure add here the Words of one of the greatest Divines, and truest Thinkers of the present Age, the late Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI>
<Q>View this Earth our Habitation, says he, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Butler's</HI> Analogy, p. 93.</NOTE> and we shall see this happy Tendency of Virtue, by imagining an Instance not so vast or re∣mote;
<PB N="20" REF="008079_0018_102FD1B08E004A20"/>
by supposing a Kingdom or Society of Men upon it, perfectly virtuous, for a Succession of many Ages; to which, if you please, may be given a Situation advantageous for universal Monarchy. In such a State, there would be no such Thing as Fac∣tion: but Men of the greatest Capacity would of Course, all along, have the chief Direction of Af∣fairs willingly yielded unto them; and they would share it among themselves without Envy. Each of these would have the Part assigned him, to which his Genius was peculiarly adapted: and others, who had not any distinguished Genius, would be safe, and think themselves very happy, by being under the Protection and Guidance of those who had. Public Determinations would be really the Result of the united Wisdom of the Community: and they would faithfully be executed by the united Strength of it. Some would in an higher Way contribute, but all would in some Way contribute, to the pub∣lic Prosperity: and in it, each would enjoy the Fruits of his own Virtue. And as Injustice, whether by Fraud or Force, would be unknown among themselves; so they would be sufficiently secured from it in their Neighbours. For Cunning and false Self-interest, Confederacies in Injustice, ever slight, and accompanied with Faction and intestine Treach∣ery; these on one Hand would be found mere childish Folly and Wickedness, when set in Oppo∣sition against Wisdom, publick Spirit, Union inviola∣ble, and Fidelity, on the other: allowing both a sufficient Length of Years to try their Force. Add the general Influence, which such a Kingdom would have over the Face of the Earth, by Way of Ex∣ample particularly, and the Reverence which would be paid it. It would plainly be superior to all others, and the World must gradually come under its Em∣pire:
<PB N="21" REF="008079_0019_102FD1B3B82C9D80"/>
not by Means of lawless Violence; but partly by what must be allowed to be just Conquest; and partly by other Kingdoms submitting themselves voluntarily to it, throughout a Course of Ages, and claiming its Protection, one after another, in suc∣cessive Exigencies. The Head of it would be an universal Monarch, in another Sense than any Mortal has yet been; and the eastern Style would be literally applicable to him, <HI>that all People, Nations and Languages should serve him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>DIVINE Revelation, designed to inspire the best Hopes, teaches us, that what is the genuine Tendency of Religion shall be in due Time, its Effect. That true Goodness shall prevail, and triumph, and establish it self, and bring with it the amiable Train of Blessings, which are its Offspring, its Attendants.</P>
<P>FROM the unhappy Time, when the World became corrupt and wicked, Hopes were given by the Father of Mercies, to those who mourned their Fall, of Deliver∣ance, from the present as well as future, evil Conse∣quences of Sin. As the present Sufferings of Life, Contentions and Wars in particular, are not only the natural Punishment, but Remedy and Cure of Vice, so every Interposition of God, in the Way of granting Knowledge of Truth or Motives to Goodness, have been supernatural Methods, of lessening these Evils, and bring∣ing on happier Scenes. The Son of God from Heaven especially, bro't to Light such a System of practical Re∣ligion in all its Parts, as if lived up to, would establish universal Peace on Earth, and Good-will among Men. And to the Times of his Appearance, above all the Times, when his Gospel shall be generally known, and embraced, 'tis probable many sublime Parts of Pro∣phecy, both of the old and new Testament belong; which carry us forward to the Days, when the Son of
<PB N="22" REF="008079_0020_102FD1B62486CCB0"/>
God <HI>shall judge among the Nations, and rebuke many People, and they shall beat their Swords into Plow∣shares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks, Nation shall not rise against Nation, neither shall they learn War any more.</HI> When <HI>the Wolf and the Lamb shall feed together, and the Lion shall eat Straw</HI> like the Bullock. When <HI>the Kingdom and Dominion, and the Greatness of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, shall be given to the People of the Saints of the most High: whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and all Domi∣nion and Rulers shall serve and obey him.</HI></P>
<P>To Men, who have perhaps too hastily concluded, that the Consummation of all Things is at Hand, and therefore that if such a tranquil State should arrive, its Continuance would be short, and no Way proportiona∣ble to the Length of Time, spent in introducing it; to such, the Prospect may not appear, very interesting and important. But to those, who think, that the Oracles of Truth intimate to us, a long Tract of Time, wherein the Inhabitants of that <HI>Earth wherein dwelleth Righteousness,</HI> shall enjoy the substantial Pleasures of Peace and Love, arising from Truth and Sanctity; such a Length of Time, as the preparatory Scene shall bear no more Proportion to, than three or four Years to a Thousand: What a Relief does such a View give under present Darkness! What a reviving Prospect of the Happiness of Posterity! what an amiable Image of divine Benevolence!</P>
<P>BUT as to the Questions How and When; <HI>It is not for us to know the Times and Seasons, which the Fa∣ther has put in his own Power.</HI> That Christianity has had in some Degree such an Effect, historic Truth might justify. It might I believe be affirmed, that those who have <HI>changed the Truth of God into a Lye,</HI> buri∣ed the Doctrine of Christ, under a Load of detestable
<PB N="23" REF="008079_0021_102FD1B7F4C28BC8"/>
Superstitions, have abundantly most often, been unjust Aggressors, in the Wars of Christendom. By spiriting to and supporting in cruel Persecutions, by stirring up Re∣bellion against lawful Rulers, by forging Wills of Prin∣ces, by Plots, by Murders and Massacres. But scarce any of these, much less of reformed Princes, have en∣gaged in Wars, without at least avowing just and neces∣sary Causes; always excepting the late <HI>Louis</HI> the XIVth of <HI>France,</HI> who could Robber like, in Time of pro∣found Peace, over-run whole Provinces which owed him no Subjection, and fill them with Blood and Ruin, and his Motive, forsooth, was his Glory; Tyrant, what was thy Idea of Glory! Tho' the Dictates of Religion are not always observed, yet flagrant Breaches of them are so justly odious, as that those are restrained in some Mea∣sure by Sense of Reputation, and Fear of general Re∣sentment, whom the Ties of Conscience will not hold. And tho' it has been often said by Libertines, that Re∣ligion has occasioned more Bloodshed, than any other Cause, yet sober Minds will always examine the Evi∣dence of such undistinguishing Assertions. Tempe∣rance, Justice, Truth, Love, certainly lead to Victory, Prosperity, and general Peace; but great Oppressors have never wanted Pretences to gain Abettors in their Designs. The Corruptions of Christianity especially, have been called in Aid of villainous Purposes. The Founder of our Religion who knew what was in Man, was aware it would be so; and therefore said, he came not to <HI>send Peace, but a Sword;</HI> but it is nevertheless true, that <HI>the Wisdom which is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle and easy to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits;</HI> and Societies as well as Indi∣viduals, partake of its benign Influence, in Proportion as they possess its Spirit.</P>
<P>AND when it shall please God, by such Means as are always in his Hand, whether the triumphant Arms,
<PB N="24" REF="008079_0022_102FD1BA3456C208"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> triumphant Virtues of such whom he employs, to purge away Corruption, and to propagate the Spirit of the Gospel of his Son universally, in Governors and Subjects, when its Tendency to Success and Victory to Peace and Tranquillity, to every present and future Good, are realised; when Friendship, Justice and Love, shall be the Cement of allied Republics, or the Princi∣ple of Obedience to some one great and good Prince, or a Succession of them; when the few Enemies to the Welfare of Mankind shall be restrained, and find that <HI>no Weapon formed against</HI> the general Good <HI>shall pros∣per:</HI> What a Seat of serene and pleasurable Enjoyment will this World be, compared with its present Conditi∣on? And if God shall continue this State for Ages and Generations; how may we congratulate Posterity on their distinguished Privilege, only to be exceeded by the Joys of the World above.</P>
<P>IF I have not already tired the Patience of my Hear∣ers, I will endeavour not to do it, by being brief in my REFLECTIONS on this Subject, which might other∣wise be copious.</P>
<P>MY principle Intention in what I have said (may it be its Effect) has been to set the Course of Nature res∣pecting public Confusions and Contests in such a Light, as shall lead to high and honourable Conceptions of God, to a religious Dependance upon him, quiet us under Disappointments, and animate our Hopes, point out our Duty and the Way to Prosperity.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">I. IF I have in any good Degree executed this De∣sign, we shall be now led to contemplate, with profound Veneration, the Most High God, who stiles himself
<PB N="25" REF="008079_0023_102FD1BC8EB0C5D0"/>
<HI>the Lord of Hosts</HI> and <HI>God of Armies,</HI> who superin∣tends all Nature, who rides in the Whirlwind and di∣rects the Storm, who <HI>calms the Raging of the Sea, and the Tumult of the People,</HI> we shall think of him as unsearchable in Wisdom, chusing to bring about Events merciful or corrective, not by his immediate Energy, but as setting to work, all the Wheels as I may say of an immense Machine, directing them so as every Part shall answer his Ends; we shall see all the Convulsions among the Nations, as Parts of his Plan, who is <HI>excel∣lent in Council, and wonderful in Working.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we consider the Operation of second Causes, the Effects of military Skill, of Wisdom and Courage▪ especially of true Goodness, their Tendency to Victory and Prosperity, we shall carry our Views to him, who <HI>teaches our Hands to war and our Fingers to fight</HI>▪ whose <HI>is the Greatness and the Power and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>PARTICULARLY; when we think of the Nation, which has been our ancient and constant Enemy, no sooner ratifying a Treaty of Peace, but insidiously attempt∣ing to elude and break it, invading our Territories, me∣ditating our Destruction, hemming us in with Fortresses, pouring the barbarous Salvages on the innocent and defenceless: And not only aiming at these compara∣tively little Things, but disturbing the Peace of Eu∣rope, threatning to swallow up all that should dare to maintain the common Rights of Society: After these mighty Strides yet gaining Advantages, but small, when set against their immense Expence of Blood and Treasure, ingloriously quitting a Country they had treated as conquered; baffled, pursued, threatned on all Sides, nearly reduced to the defensive.—We may esteem the next Causes, of such Events to be, The
<PB N="26" REF="008079_0024_102FD1BFF01F80F8"/>
immeasurable Grasp of Ambition, which sometimes over-reaches itself—That Unsteadiness in Design, and Feebleness in Execution, which the Want of Justice tends to produce—The Weakness or Wickedness of Commanders, or want of Spirit in an Army of Slaves; but all these are Means, which supreme Wisdom for the Peace and Welfare of the World, has ordained to lead to such Events. Religion teaches us so to esteem them, and on the View of them, to adore and glorify him, <HI>who maketh a Way in the Sea, and a Path in the mighty Waters, which bringeth forth the Chariot and Horse, the Army and the Power; when he pleases they shall lie down together, they shall not rise, they are extinct, they are quenched as Tow.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN it pleases God to raise up a Hero, at the very Crisis of the Fate of the public Liberty, capable of pe∣netrating the Recesses of the Conclaves of Oppression, of Wisdom and Resolution sufficient to defeat its best laid Measures; If we follow him with his faithful Troops traversing whole Countries like <HI>the Lightning, which cometh from the East and shineth even unto the West,</HI> or rushing on these Banditti, like an impetuous Torrent; we admire the Man, but we adore the God, in <HI>whose Hands the Hearts of Kings are;</HI> we as it were hear his Voice, as he uttered it of old, <HI>I have raised up One from the North and he shall come, from the Ri∣sing of the Sun he shall call upon my Name; and he shall come upon Princes as upon Mortar, and as the Potter treadeth Clay.</HI></P>
<P>IF we return Home, however we may resolve the calamitous Events our Nation and Land have experi∣enced, into the Effects of Cowardice, Negligence, Stu∣pidity or worse Causes; however we may wonder at the Conduct of Men in important Trusts; yet Religion
<PB N="27" REF="008079_0025_102FD1C217B88E38"/>
teaches us to look higher, to esteem these but Means and Instruments of divine Chastisements; to the End that we may be led to Amendment, or if we are incor∣rigible, be plagued till our Place <HI>be left to us desolate.</HI> Future Events remain with God. A Series of such as we have seen and felt, would reduce us to such a Situation, as is painful even to imagine. But suppose this Year's Campaign to be as successful as the most sanguine Hopes can paint it out; yet if we have left God and his Ways, such Successes may be in the End the greatest Misfortunes, giving Scope to all Vice, tak∣ing off all Restraint, and so only serving to the putting off the evil Day, which will come in its Time with seven-fold Vengeance. For in the Nature of Things, <HI>The Prosperity of Fools will destroy them.</HI></P>
<P>THE proper Use of such Meditations, on the Supre∣macy and Providence of God, is, to engage us to de∣pend upon him for every Blessing by fervent Prayer, to cast our Cares upon him, and especially to engage us to our best Endeavours, that We, the Land and Nation we are Part of, may become a People prepared for divine Mercy.</P>
<P N="2">II. UPON what has been said, I would remark, that every one ought carefully to perform present Duty.</P>
<P>IN common Life, Men's fixing their Attention on visionary Prospects, so as to neglect the ordinary Busi∣ness of the Day, is imprudent and ruinous. So would it be, for us to adopt Maxims of Conduct, suited only to the golden Age of Truth and Peace. The Prin∣ciples therefore of that meek Sect among us, which ad∣mit not of Self-defence, as they are not the Principles of Revelation, so neither are they agreable to the pre∣sent State of Things; and were they generally em∣braced,
<PB N="28" REF="008079_0026_102FD1C3A5709070"/>
their Absurdity would be soon felt, or Nature would rebel against Principle.</P>
<P>WITH Reverence and Gratitude, we think of the Constitution of God, in which natural Evil lessens the Quantity of moral, Adversity purges away Sin. With joy we receive the glad Tidings of what shall be. We hope that the Calamities of this Day, shall bring on happier Times. But our Lot is not cast in those calm Seasons. We have Injustice, Fraud and Violence to conflict with. The divine Blessing on the vast Arma∣ments now entring on Action, may indeed open to us more pleasing Prospects. But it seems as tho' America was destined to be the Seat of frequent Wars. This at last is a Day of Darkness. What is Wisdom? What is Duty? 'Tis to employ every Measure wherein we may depend on God for the Settlement of our Safety.</P>
<P>A MILITARY Spirit ought to be cultivated. Our Rulers are sensible of it. They have amended our Laws in this Respect. If Persons of Weight and Fi∣gure would countenance Exercises of this Sort, they would be much better attended to, and esteemed a se∣tious Business. Whereas while our Militia consists chiefly of Children, Apprentices, and Men of the low∣est Rank, as in some Towns it does, and every one, who can pay a small Fine, thinks it beneath him to appear on a Muster, we shall never make a respectable Figure, in that Way.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY should we take Care, to educate our Youth in Temperance and Virtue, to inspire them with public Spirit, with that Fear of God and Sense of Re∣ligion, which is the only solid Principle of Obedience, Patience, Courage, Moderation, Compassion, Honour, and every Quality, becoming of a Soldier, a Defender of his Country, a Chastiser of Oppressors.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="008079_0027_102FD1C74E6FC148"/>THESE are general Duties; every Order of Men have their own, are called of God to the Offices of their respective Departments.</P>
<P>HOW does the Heart of a Briton, glow with grate∣ful Resentment, when he sees our venerable Sovereign the Father of his People, burdened with the Infirmi∣ties of Age, yet supporting himself under the additi∣onal Burthen of repeated Disappointments, arising from —I know not what—steadily opposing the common Enemy on every Quarter; anxious for the Welfare of the most distant Corners of his Dominions, vigilant, resolute. God grant he may live to see the happy Effect of his paternal Care and vigorous Measures, that his People being restored to their Rights and Quiet, he may say, <HI>Now Lord, lettest thou thy Servant de∣part in Peace, for mine Eyes have seen thy Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Your Excellency</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His Excellency THOMAS POWNALL, Esq.</NOTE> will permit me, according to the Custom of this Day, to say on this first Occasion, of properly addressing you from the Desk, in your Capa∣city of Captain General of this Province, that tho' God be Lord of all, yet such is his Appointment, that the Fate of Societies, much depends on the Conduct of subordinate Rulers. You have been entrusted with the Government of this Province, at a Time when your Attention, is to be peculiarly fixed on military Affairs, and all your Wisdom and Fidelity needed. We re∣ceive as an Omen of Good, what has been heard with∣out Doors, of your <HI>Excellency</HI>'s Zeal for the Perfection and due Execution of our military Laws; your Ad∣herence to the Maxim of giving none Commissions in the Service of this Year's Campaign, but those who could be recommended by Men of Worth; the Quiet and Silence with which so very large a Body of Troops
<PB N="30" REF="008079_0028_102FD1C9865988B8"/>
has been raised in the Government, under your Influ∣ence, this Season. Your public Speeches shew your just and extensive Views of the evil Designs of our in∣veterate Enemies, and your Resolution to do your Part, and direct us to ours, for our Protection and Defence.</P>
<P>MAY you see a happy Effect of these First-fruits of your Care for the Public, here. Whatever be the Event now, yet you are, Sir, in the prime of Life, and should God continue you in this Post, till old Age, till you shall see another Generation risen, formed by your civil as well as military Influence, to that manly Tem∣perance, which you yourself feel the Benefit of; to that Virtue and Piety, which even bad Rulers find the Necessity of cultivating as an Engine of Policy, and which we are convinced you will promote, from an inward Sense of its Operation on the present and future Good of the People you govern; you will then resign your Trust, with that Pleasure, which a benevolent Heart feels, on having done great and lasting Good, sure that in these Attempts for promoting permanent Happiness, in your Sphere, you will meet with the Approbation of that gracious Being, who <HI>is good to all, and whose tender Mercies are over all his Works.</HI></P>
<P>It remains, that you <HI>Gentlemen of the Artillery,</HI> be exhorted to profit by the Doctrine of our Text. In aiming at superior military Accomplishments, you act a Part suitable to the present State of the World, and wherein you may be Workers together with God, whose Judgments are a great Deep, for the bringing on, a better. It has been suggested, that our Enemies have of late been supplyed with gallant Officers, by Means of their Academies of War, and such other Encourage∣ments, as have excited them by every Motive of Ho∣our and Profit, to be expert in their Profession. So far
<PB N="31" REF="008079_0029_102FD1CB12A0BCE0"/>
as your Example and Influence extend, we follow them. It were to be wished, a Spirit of Emulation more prevailed, and that in every Town, small Com∣panies of Men of such a Genius were formed, and your Pattern followed. For if <HI>New-England</HI> would be safe, her Children must be a Band of hardy Soldiors, for Generations to come, till the Nations of the World shall learn War no more. The Scene too, is changed since the last Age, and indeed since the last War. Tis no longer the only Thing needful to ferret out a skulking Enemy from their Recesses; We have to con∣tend with disciplined Troops, and cannot be always sure of Assistance from Abroad.</P>
<P>Go on then and prosper, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> only add to every other Qualification, that most important one of solid Religion, the Influence of which I have attempted to describe. Let me add, that as you are Gentlemen of superiour Figure, should you be called to active Ser∣vice, you will probably be honoured with Commissions; and here your Sobriety and Virtue, will have an Influ∣ence you can scarcely now conceive of, on those under your Command. The Manners of Superiors have been found so to descend. Real Religion will not only qualify you for personal Service, but give you Weight, attract Respect and Obedience, and if it infuse not the same Spirit into all who behold it, yet awes them to that outward Decorum, which is a high Advantage in an Army. Above all it will carry <HI>You</HI> above the Fear of Death, and Armies have seldom been beat, under intrepid Officers.</P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE, Let us all be inspired to present Duty, by a firm Persuasion that right Conduct, true Goodness especially, always tends to the general Good, and that the more the Spirit of Religion prevails, the
<PB N="32" REF="008079_0030_102FD1CD4D67A7E8"/>
nearer we are to those happy Days, when God shall dwell with Men. Every private Man, who <HI>fears God and works Righteousness,</HI> lessens the Proportion of Sin, encreases and diffuses that Temper which is productive of all Good. Men in distinguished Stations, whether civil or military, do so yet more, by the Conspicuity and happy Influence of their Virtues. Princes are indeed the <HI>Sons of the most High,</HI> when they follow God, in exerting their Power, for the resisting the proud, and promoting the Peace and Prosperity of their Subjects. <HI>Angels which are greater in Power and Might, rejoice to do God's Will</HI> even when they destroy Thousands in a Night, for the Peace and Safety of those whom God delights to bless. Jesus the Mediator who is higher than the Kings of the Earth, sits enthroned on the right Hand of God, there exerting his exalted Power, in subduing his and our Enemies, by <HI>the Sword of the Spirit the Word of Truth,</HI> accompanied with his al∣mighty Energy; promoting that inward Disposition to Love and Peace, which establishes these Blessings on a better Foundation than Terror or Policy. This De∣sign he will carry on, till he has made all his <HI>Enemies his Footstool. The last Enemy that is to be destroyed is Death.</HI> This he suffers to remain, and this is like∣wise in due Time to be <HI>swallowed up in Victory,</HI> at that solemn Period, when the Purposes of God having been answered, by all the Vicissitudes of earthly Things, a yet more stable State of Blessedness shall be the Portion of those who have overcome in the Christian Conflict; then <HI>Jesus</HI> the Mediator shall also <HI>deliver up the Kingdom</HI> to him that appointed him; that <HI>God may be all, and in all.</HI></P>
