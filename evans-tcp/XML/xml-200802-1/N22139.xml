<HEAD>Rules to be strictly observed by the Patients.</HEAD>
<P>1st. The out-patients, or such as are able to go abroad, and whose cases require it, must attend at the dispensary on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, in every week, from twelve to one o'clock, in order to be prescribed for, and to receive the necessary medical aid; and likewise to call at the dispensary at such other times as shall be judged necessary.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="029201_0007_0FDFCA09779147E0"/>
2d. Those patients who are not able to go abroad, must send their recommendations to the dispensary, as early as possible after receiving them; when they will be visited by the physician at their respective places of abode. And all patients are required attentively to follow such directions as shall be given them, both with regard to medicines and diet, and particularly respect∣ing spirituous liquors.</P>
<P>3d. When any persons, recommended as out-pa∣tients (that is, such as are able to go abroad) become incapable of attending at the dispensary, agreeably to the first rule, such persons must send word to the dis∣pensary of their inability, in order that the physician may be informed thereof, who will attend them at their own houses.</P>
<P>4th. No person will be considered objects of this charity, but such as are really necessitous.</P>
<P>5th. All the phials, gallipots, and other utensils are to be carefully cleansed and returned to the dispensary.</P>
<P>6th. All cases of neglect or disobedience to these rules, may be punished by dismission from the benefits of the dispensary, at the discretion of the monthly com∣mittee, appointed by the managers to visit the dispensary.</P>
<P>7th. If any out-patients shall continue absent from the dispensary for the space of two weeks, he or she being so absent, shall be considered as discharged, un∣less a reason shall be given by such absent patient, as, in the judgment of one of the members of the visiting monthly committee, for the time being, shall be deemed satisfactory.</P>
<P>8th. All patients shall bring or send their recom∣mendations to the dispensary within the space of two weeks after their respective dates, otherwise such re∣commendations will not be received.</P>

<P>From the foregoing return the public will be enabled to form some judgment of the future advantage that the poor of this City may hope to derive from this institution, which has benevolence alone for its object. The families of many persons, whose daily support depends upon their daily labor, not being able to defray the expence of physicians, attend∣ance, and medicine, frequently suffer great inconvenience when sick, for want of medical aid; and others, when un∣der like circumstances, submit to the expence, often employ persons with a small share of medical knowledge, in conse∣quence of which life is sometimes lost, and at best involve themselves and families in difficulties, from which, in some instances, they rarely recover. The many advantages which have been derived from similar institutions, both in Europe and America, inspire a pleasing hope in the minds of the Managers, that such of their fellow citizens, who, in this and many instances, have manifested a spirit of liberality, which justly entitles them to the warmest approbation, will continue to give this institution their special patronage.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="029201_0012_0FDFCA160FA35B60"/>
That the Dispensary might be supplied with the best medicines, and at first hand, the Managers some time past imported a considerable assortment from Europe, which are paid for, and they have now remaining on hand medicines and furniture to the amount of about 160l.—They have also imported four complete sets of aparatus, for the recovery of persons apparently drowned, which are deposited at the following places, to wit.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>One at Mr. Abraham Van Guelders, No. 77, Cortlandt-street, North river.</ITEM>
<ITEM>One at Mr. Abraham Bond's, No. 8, Little Water-street.</ITEM>
<ITEM>One at Mr. Alderman Van Tuyl's, No. 46. Water-street near Fly market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>One at Mr. Alderman Beekman's Water-street, between Pecks-flip and New-slip.</ITEM>

<P>The present annual account of subscriptions to the Dis∣pensary, after deducting the expences for collecting, is a∣bout 400l. and this statement is made without making any allowance for subscribers who may happen to die, or re∣move from the city; so that in all probability, the next an∣nual revenue of the Dispensary, as the subscriptions now stand, will fall short of the sum of 400l. above mentioned; and as the yearly expences of the Dispensary, including house-rent, physician, surgeon, and apothecary's salary, amount to nearly the aforesaid sum, it will be impossible for the managers to extend its usefulness to the degree they ar∣dently wish, unless many of their fellow citizens, who have sufficient ability, and who have not yet honoured the insti∣tution with their names, will come forward and give it their patronage. From the above representation, the public will see the propriety and necessity of the managers soliciting fresh contributions, for the support of an institution, ever open and ready to afford medical relief to the indigent sick.</P>
<P>Subscriptions will be taken at the Dispensary; also by Mr. Moses Rogers, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Treasurer, or by any of the managers.</P>
