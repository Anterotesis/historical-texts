<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>AS the occasion of this Poem was real, not fic∣titious, so the method pursued in it, was rather imposed, by what spontaneously arose in the Au∣thor's mind, on that occasion, than meditated, or designed. Which will appear very probable from the nature of it. For it differs from the common mode of Poetry; which is, from long narrations to draw short morals. Here, on the contrary, the narrative is short, and the morality arising from it makes the bulk of the Poem. The reason of it is, That the facts mentioned did naturally pour these moral reflections on the thought of the writer.</P>

<HEAD>A PANEGYRIC On Young's NIGHT-THOUGHTS, from Hervey's MEDITATIONS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><LG>
<L>Death's terror is the mountain faith removes:</L>
<L>'Tis faith disarms destruction.—</L>
<L>Believe, and look with triumph on the tomb.</L>
</LG></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE, and some other quotations, I am proud to borrow from the Night-Thoughts espe∣cially from Night the Fourth. In which, energy of language, sublimity of sentiment, and the most exquisite beauties of poetry, are the least perfections to be admired. Almost every line glows with de∣votion; rises into the most exalted apprehensions of the adorable Redeemer; and is animated with the most lively faith in his all-sufficient mediation. The author of this excellent performance has the peculiar felicity, of ennobling all the strength of style, and every delicacy of imagination, with the grand and distinguishing truths of Christianity. These thoughts give the highest entertainment to the fancy, and impart the noblest improvement to the mind. They not only refine our taste, but prepare us for death, and ripen us for glory. I never take up this admirable piece, but I am ready to cry out.—<HI>Tecun. vivere amem, tecum obeam libens;</HI> i. e. <Q>Inspire me with such a spirit, and life shall be delightful, nor death itself unwelcome.</Q></P>

<HEAD>Mrs. ROWE's Approbation of these Works, being the Dedication of her celebrated Letters.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the REVEREND DOCTOR YOUNG. <HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE no design in this Dedication, but to express my gratitude, for the pleasure and advant∣age I have received from your POEM on the LAST JUDGMENT, and the PARAPHRASE on part of the Book of JOB.</P>
<P>[His Night Thoughts were not published at this time.]</P>
<P>The Author of these letters is above any view of interest, and can have no prospect of reputation, re∣solving to be concealed: But if they prove a serious entertainment to persons whose leisure hours are not always innocently employed, the end is fully answered.</P>
<P>The greatest Infidel must own, there is at least as much probability in this scheme, as in that of the <HI>Fairy Tales,</HI> which however visionary, are some of them moral and entertaining,</P>

<HEAD>THE COMPLAINT. NIGHT THE FIRST. ON LIFE, DEATH, AND IMMORTALITY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the RIGHT HONOURABLE ARTHUR ONSLOW, <ABBR>ESQ.</ABBR> SPEAKER of the BRITISH HOUSE of COMMONS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TIR'D nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep!</L>
<L>He, like the world, his ready visit pays</L>
<L>Where fortune smiles; the wretched he forsakes;</L>
<L>Swift on his downy Pinion flies from woe,</L>
<L>And lights on lids unsully'd with a tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From short (as usual) and disturb'd repose,</L>
<L>I wake: How happy they, who wake no more!</L>
<L>Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.</L>
<L>I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams</L>
<L>Tumultuous; where my wreck'd desponding thought,</L>
<L>From wave to wave of fancy'd misery,</L>
<L>At random drove, her helm of reason lost.</L>
<L>Tho' now restor'd, 'tis only change of pain,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="015714_0008_0F99DC39F52B2138"/>
(A bitter change!) severer for severe.</L>
<L>The day too short for my distress! and night,</L>
<L>Ev'n in the Zenith of her dark domain,</L>
<L>Is sunshine, to the colour of my fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Night, sable Goddess! from her Ebon throne,</L>
<L>In rayless majesty, now stretches forth</L>
<L>Her leaden sceptre o'er a slumb'ring world.</L>
<L>Silence, how dead! and darkness, how profound!</L>
<L>Nor eye, nor list'ning ear, an object finds;</L>
<L>Creation sleeps. 'Tis as the gen'ral pulse</L>
<L>Of life stood still, and nature made a pause;</L>
<L>An aweful pause! prophetic of her end,</L>
<L>And let her prophecy be soon fulfill'd;</L>
<L>Fate! drop the curtain; I can lose no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Silence and darkness! solemn sisters! twins</L>
<L>From antient night, who nurse the tender thought</L>
<L>To reason, and on reason build resolve,</L>
<L>(That column of true majesty in man)</L>
<L>Assist me: I will thank you in the grave;</L>
<L>The grave, your kingdom: There this frame shall fall</L>
<L>A victim sacred to your dreary shrine.</L>
<L>But what are Ye?—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THOU, who didst put to flight</L>
<L>Primaeval silence, when the morning stars,</L>
<L>Exulting, shouted o'er the rising ball;</L>
<L>O THOU, whose word from solid darkness struck</L>
<L>That spark, the sun, strike wisdom from my soul;</L>
<L>My soul, which flies to thee, her trust, her treasure,</L>
<L>As misers to their gold, while others rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' this opaque of nature, and of soul,</L>
<L>This double night, transmit one pitying ray,</L>
<L>To lighten, and to chear. O lead my mind,</L>
<L>(A mind that fain would wander from its woe)</L>
<L>Lead it thro' various scenes of life and death;</L>
<L>And from each scene, the noblest truths inspire.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="015714_0009_0F99DC3AC8F8C0C0"/>
Nor less inspire my conduct, than my song;</L>
<L>Teach my best reason, reason; my best will</L>
<L>Teach rectitude; and fix my firm resolve</L>
<L>Wisdom to wed, and pay her long arrear:</L>
<L>Nor let the phial of thy vegeance, pour'd</L>
<L>On this devoted head, be pour'd in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bell strikes one. We take no note of time,</L>
<L>But from its loss. To give it then a tongue,</L>
<L>Is wise in man. As if an angel spoke,</L>
<L>I feel the solemn sound. If heard aright,</L>
<L>It is the knell of my departed hours:</L>
<L>Where are they? With the years beyond the flood.</L>
<L>It is the signal that demands dispatch:</L>
<L>How much is to be done? My hopes and fears</L>
<L>Start up alarm'd, and o'er life's narrow verge</L>
<L>Look down—On what? A fathomless abyss;</L>
<L>A dread eternity! how surely mine!</L>
<L>And can eternity belong to me,</L>
<L>Poor pensioner on the bounties of an hour?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,</L>
<L>How complicate, how wonderful, is man?</L>
<L>How passing wonder HE, who made him such?</L>
<L>Who centred in our make such strange extremes?</L>
<L>From diff'rent natures marvelously mixt,</L>
<L>Connection exquisite of distant worlds!</L>
<L>Distinguisht link in Being's endless chain!</L>
<L>Midway from nothing to the Deity!</L>
<L>A beam ethereal, sully'd, and absorpt!</L>
<L>Tho' sully'd, and dishonour'd, still divine!</L>
<L>Dim miniature of greatness absolute!</L>
<L>An heir of glory! A frail child of dust!</L>
<L>Helpless immortal! Insect infinite!</L>
<L>A worm! a God!—I tremble at myself,</L>
<L>And in myself am lost! At home a stranger,</L>
<L>Thought wanders up and down, surpriz'd, aghast,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="015714_0010_0F99DC3B99679210"/>
And wond'ring at her own: How reason reels!</L>
<L>O what a miracle to man is man,</L>
<L>Triumphantly distress'd! what joy, what dread!</L>
<L>Alternately transported, and alarm'd!</L>
<L>What can preserve my life? or what destroy?</L>
<L>An angel's arm can't snatch me from the grave;</L>
<L>Legions of angels can't confine me there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis past conjecture; all things rise in proof:</L>
<L>While o'er my limbs sleep's soft dominion spread,</L>
<L>What tho' my soul phantastic measures trod</L>
<L>O'er fairy fields; or mourn'd along the gloom</L>
<L>Of pathless woods; or down the craggy steep</L>
<L>Hurl'd headlong, swam with pain the mantled pool;</L>
<L>Or scal'd the cliff; or danc'd on hollow winds,</L>
<L>With antic shapes, wild natives of the brain?</L>
<L>Her ceaseless flight, tho' devious, speaks her nature</L>
<L>Of subtler essence than the trodden clod;</L>
<L>Active, aereal, tow'ring; unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Unfetter'd with her gross companion's fall.</L>
<L>Ev'n silent night proclaims my soul immortal:</L>
<L>Ev'n silent night proclaims eternal day.</L>
<L>For human weal, heav'n husbands all events;</L>
<L>Dull sleep instructs, nor sport vain dreams in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why then their loss deplore, that are not lost?</L>
<L>Why wanders wretched thought their tombs around,</L>
<L>In infidel distress? Are angels there?</L>
<L>Slumbers, rak'd up in dust, ethereal fire?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They live! they greatly live a life on earth</L>
<L>Unkindled, unconceiv'd; and from an eye</L>
<L>Of tenderness, let heav'nly pity fall</L>
<L>On me, more justly number'd with the dead.</L>
<L>This is the desart, this the solitude:</L>
<L>How populous! how vital is the grave!</L>
<L>This is creation's melancholy vault,</L>
<L>The vale funereal, the sad Cypress gloom;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="015714_0011_0F99DC3C2796D788"/>
The land of apparitions, empty shades!</L>
<L>All, all on earth is shadow, all beyond</L>
<L>Is substance; the reverse is Folly's creed:</L>
<L>How solid all, where change shall be no more?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This is the bud of being, the dim dawn,</L>
<L>The twilight of our day, the vestibule;</L>
<L>Life's theatre as yet is shut, and death.</L>
<L>Strong death, alone can heave the massy bar,</L>
<L>This gross impediment of clay remove,</L>
<L>And make us embryos of existence free.</L>
<L>From real life, but little more remote</L>
<L>Is he, not yet a candidate for light,</L>
<L>The future embryo, slumb'ring in his fire,</L>
<L>Embryos we must be, till we burst the shell,</L>
<L>Yon ambient azure shell, and spring to life,</L>
<L>The life of Gods, O transport! and of man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet man, fool man! here buries all his thoughts:</L>
<L>Interrs celestial hopes without one sigh.</L>
<L>Pris'ner of earth, and pent beneath the moon,</L>
<L>Here pinions all his wishes; wing'd by heav'n</L>
<L>To fly at infinite; and reach it there,</L>
<L>Where Seraphs gather immortality,</L>
<L>On life's fair tree, fast by the throne of God.</L>
<L>What golden joys ambrosial clust'ring glow,</L>
<L>In HIS full beam, and ripen for the just,</L>
<L>Where momentary ages are no more!</L>
<L>Where time, and pain, and chance, and death, expire?</L>
<L>And is it in the flight of threescore years,</L>
<L>To push eternity from human thought,</L>
<L>And smother souls immortal in the dust?</L>
<L>A soul immortal, spending all her fires,</L>
<L>Wasting her strength in strenuous idleness,</L>

Resembles ocean into tempest wrought,</L>
<L>To waft a feather, or to drown a fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where falls this censure? It o'erwhelms myself;</L>
<L>How was my heart incrusted by the world!</L>
<L>O how self-fetter'd was my grov'ling soul!</L>
<L>How, like a worm, was I wrapt round and round</L>
<L>In silken thought, which reptile fancy spun,</L>
<L>Till darken'd reason lay quite clouded o'er</L>
<L>With soft conceit of endless comfort here,</L>
<L>Nor yet put forth her wings to reach the skies!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Night-visions may befriend (as sung above):</L>
<L>Our waking dreams are fatal. How I dreamt</L>
<L>Of things impossible? (Could sleep do more?)</L>
<L>Of joys perpetual in perpetual change?</L>
<L>Of stable pleasures on the tossing wave?</L>
<L>Eternal sunshine in the storms of life?</L>
<L>How richly were my noon-tide trances hung</L>
<L>With gorgeous tapestries of pictur'd joys?</L>
<L>Joy behind joy, in endless perspective!</L>
<L>Till at Death's toll, whose restless iron tongue</L>
<L>Calls daily for his millions at a meal,</L>
<L>Starting I woke, and found myself undone.</L>
<L>Where now my phrensy's pompous furniture?</L>
<L>The cobweb'd cottage, with its ragged wall</L>
<L>Of mould'ring mud, is royalty to me!</L>
<L>The spider's most attenuated thread</L>
<L>Is cord, is cable, to man's tender tie</L>
<L>On earthly bliss; it breaks at every breeze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O ye blest scenes of permanent delight!</L>
<L>Full, above measure! lasting, beyond bound!</L>
<L>A perpetuity of bliss is bliss.</L>
<L>Could you, so rich in rapture, fear an end,</L>
<L>That ghastly thought would drink up all your joy,</L>
<L>And quite unparadise the realms of light.</L>
<L>Safe are you lodg'd above these rolling spheres;</L>

The baleful influence of whose giddy dance</L>
<L>Sheds sad vicissitude on all beneath.</L>
<L>Here teems with revolutions every hour;</L>
<L>And rarely for the better; or the best,</L>
<L>More mortal than the common births of fate.</L>
<L>Each moment has its sickle, emulous</L>
<L>Of Time's enormous scythe, whose ample sweep</L>
<L>Strikes empires from the root; each moment plays</L>
<L>His little weapon in the narrower sphere</L>
<L>Of sweet domestic comfort, and cuts down</L>
<L>The fairest bloom of sublunary bliss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bliss! sublunary bliss!—Proud words, and vain!</L>
<L>Implicit treason to divine decree!</L>
<L>A bold invasion of the rights of heav'n!</L>

<L>Death! great proprietor of all! 'tis thine</L>

<L>Of ceaseless change outwhirl'd in human life?</L>
<L>How wanes my borrow'd bliss! from Fortune's smile,</L>

Thought, busy thought! too busy for my peace!</L>

<L>I rue the riches of my former fate;</L>
<L>Sweet comfort's blasted clusters I lament;</L>
<L>I tremble at the blessings once so dear;</L>

<L>Such is earth's melancholy map! But far</L>

<LG>
<L>What then am I, who sorrow for myself?</L>
<L>In age, in infancy, from others aid</L>
<L>Is all our hope; to teach us to be kind.</L>
<L>That, nature's first, last lesson to mankind;</L>
<L>The selfish heart deserves the pain it feels.</L>
<L>More gen'rous sorrow, while it sinks, exalts;</L>

Is heav'n tremendous in its frowns? most sure;</L>
<L>And in its favours formidable too:</L>
<L>Its favours here are trials, not rewards;</L>
<L>A call to duty, not discharge from care;</L>
<L>And should alarm us, full as much as woes;</L>
<L>Awake us to their cause, and consequence;</L>
<L>And make us tremble, weigh'd with our desert;</L>
<L>Awe Nature's tumult, and chastise her joys,</L>
<L>Lest while we clasp, we kill them; nay, invert</L>

<L>But their hearts wounded, like the wounded air,</L>

<HEAD>THE COMPLAINT. NIGHT THE SECOND. ON TIME, DEATH, FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE EARL OF WILMINGTON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>"WHEN the cock crew, he wept"—Smote by that eye,</L>
<L>Which looks on me, on all: that pow'r, who bids</L>
<L>This midnight centinel, with clarion shrill,</L>
<L>Emblem of that which shall awake the dead,</L>
<L>Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.</L>
<L>Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?</L>
<L>And fortitude abandon'd, where is man?</L>
<L>I know the terms on which he sees the light;</L>
<L>He that is born, is listed; life is war;</L>
<L>Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,</L>
<L>Deserves it least.—On other themes I'll dwell.</L>
<L>Lorenzo! let me turn my thoughts on thee,</L>
<L>And thine, on themes may profit; profit there,</L>
<L>Where most they need. Themes, too, the genuine</L>
<L>Of dear Philander's dust. He, thus, tho' dead, [growth,</L>
<L>May still befriend—What themes? Time's wondrous</L>
<L>Death, friendship, and Philander's final scene. [price,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="015714_0022_0F99DC4E29A6AC88"/>
<L>So could I touch these themes, as might obtain</L>
<L>Thine ear, nor leave thy heart quite disengag'd,</L>
<L>The good deed would delight me; half-impress</L>
<L>On my dark cloud an Iris; and from grief</L>
<L>Call glory—Dost thou mourn Philander's fate?</L>
<L>I know thou say'st it: says thy life the same?</L>
<L>He mourns the dead, who lives as they desire.</L>
<L>Where is that thrift, that avarice of TIME,</L>
<L>(O glorious avarice!) Thought of Death inspires,</L>
<L>As rumour'd robberies endear our gold?</L>
<L>O Time! than gold more sacred; more a load</L>
<L>Than lead, to fools; and fools reputed wise.</L>
<L>What moment granted man without account?</L>
<L>What years are squander'd, Wisdom's debt unpaid?</L>
<L>Our wealth in days all due to that discharge.</L>
<L>Haste, haste, he lies in wait, he's at the door,</L>
<L>Insidious Death! should his strong hand arrest,</L>
<L>No composition sets the pris'ner free.</L>
<L>Eternity's inexorable chain</L>
<L>Fast binds; and vengeance claims the full arrear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How late I shudder'd on the brink! how late</L>
<L>Life call'd for her last refuge in despair?</L>
<L>That Time is mine, O Mead, to thee I owe;</L>
<L>Fain would I pay thee with eternity.</L>
<L>But ill my genius answers my desire;</L>
<L>My sickly song is mortal, past thy cure,</L>
<L>Accept the will;—That dies not with my strain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For what calls thy disease, Lorenzo! Not</L>
<L>For esculapian, but for moral aid.</L>
<L>Thou think'st it folly to be wise too soon.</L>
<L>Youth is not rich in Time, it may be, poor;</L>
<L>Part with it as with money, sparing; pay</L>
<L>No moment, but in purchase of its worth;</L>
<L>And what its worth, ask death-beds; they can tell.</L>
<L>Part with it as with life, reluctant; big</L>

With holy hope of nobler time to come;</L>
<L>Time higher-aim'd, still nearer the great mark</L>
<L>Of men and angels; virtue more divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is this our duty, wisdom, glory, gain?</L>
<L>(These heav'n benign in vital union binds)</L>
<L>And sport we like the natives of the bough,</L>
<L>When vernal suns inspire? Amusement reigns</L>
<L>Man's great demand: To trifle is to live:</L>
<L>And is it then a trifle, too, to die?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou say'st I preach, Lorenzo! 'tis confest.</L>
<L>What, if, for once, I preach thee quite awake?</L>
<L>Who wants amusement in the flame of battle?</L>
<L>Is it not treason, to the soul immortal,</L>
<L>Her foes in arms, eternity the prize?</L>
<L>Will toys amuse, when med'cines cannot cure?</L>
<L>When spirits ebb, when life's enchanting scenes</L>
<L>Their lustre lose, and lessen in our sight,</L>
<L>As lands, and cities with their glitt'ring spires,</L>
<L>To the poor shatter'd bark, by sudden storm</L>
<L>Thrown off to sea, and soon to perish there;</L>
<L>Will toys amuse? No: Thrones will then be toys,</L>
<L>And earth and skies seem dust upon the scale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Redeem we time?—Its loss we dearly buy.</L>
<L>What pleads Lorenzo for his high priz'd sports?</L>
<L>He pleads time's num'rous blanks; he loudly pleads</L>
<L>The straw-like trifles on life's common stream.</L>
<L>From whom those blanks and trifles, but from thee?</L>
<L>No blank, no trifle, nature made, or meant.</L>
<L>Virtue, or purpos'd virtue, still be thine;</L>
<L>This cancels thy complaint at once; This leaves</L>
<L>In act no trifle, and no blank in time.</L>
<L>This g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatens, fills, immortalizes all;</L>
<L>This, the blest art of turning all to gold;</L>
<L>This, the good heart's prerogative to raise</L>
<L>A royal tribute, from the poorest hours;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="015714_0024_0F99DC4FAB118EF8"/>
Immense revenue! ev'ry moment pays.</L>
<L>If nothing more than purpose in thy power;</L>
<L>Thy purpose firm, is equal to the deed:</L>
<L>Who does the best his circumstance allows,</L>
<L>Does well, acts nobly; angels could no more.</L>
<L>Our outward act, indeed, admits restraint;</L>
<L>'Tis not in things o'er thought to domineer;</L>
<L>Guard well thy thought; our thoughts are heard in heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On all-important time, thro' ev'ry age,</L>
<L>Tho' much, and warm, the wise have urg'd; the man</L>
<L>Is yet unborn, who duly weighs an hour.</L>
<L>"I've lost a day"—The Prince who nobly cry'd,</L>
<L>Had been an emperor without his crown;</L>
<L>Of Rome? say, rather, Lord of human race:</L>
<L>He spoke, as if deputed by mankind.</L>
<L>So should all speak: So reason speaks in all:</L>
<L>From the soft whispers of that God in man,</L>
<L>Why fly to folly, why to frenzy fly,</L>
<L>For rescue from the blessings we possess?</L>
<L>Time, the supreme!—Time is eternity;</L>
<L>Pregnant with all eternity can give;</L>
<L>Pregnant with all, that makes archangels smile.</L>
<L>Who murders time, He crushes in the birth</L>
<L>A pow'r ethereal, only not ador'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! how unjust to nature, and himself,</L>
<L>Is thoughtless, thankless, inconsistent man!</L>
<L>Like children babbling nonsense in their sports,</L>
<L>We censure nature for a span too short;</L>
<L>That span too short, we tax as tedious too;</L>
<L>Torture invention, all expedients tire,</L>
<L>To lash the ling'ring moments into speed,</L>
<L>And whirl us (happy riddance!) from ourselves,</L>
<L>Art, brainless art! our furious charioteer</L>
<L>(For nature's voice unstifled would recall)</L>
<L>Drives headlong tow'rds the precipice of death;</L>

Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:</L>
<L>O what a riddle of absurdity!</L>
<L>Leisure is pain; takes off our chariot-wheels;</L>
<L>How heavily we drag the load of life!</L>
<L>Blest leisure is our curse; like that of Cain,</L>
<L>It makes us wander; wander earth around</L>
<L>To fly that tyrant, thought. As Atlas groan'd</L>
<L>The world beneath, we groan beneath an hour.</L>
<L>We cry for mercy to the next amusement;</L>
<L>The next amusement mortgages our fields!</L>
<L>Slight inconvenience! prisons hardly frown,</L>
<L>From hateful time if prisons set us free.</L>
<L>Yet when death kindly tenders us relief,</L>
<L>We call him cruel; years to moments shrink,</L>
<L>Ages to years. The telescope is turn'd.</L>
<L>To man's false optics (from his folly false)</L>
<L>Time, in advance, behind him hides his wings,</L>
<L>And seems to creep, decrepit with his age;</L>
<L>Behold him, when past by; what then is seen,</L>
<L>But his broad pinions swifter than the winds?</L>
<L>And all mankind, in contradiction strong,</L>
<L>Rueful, aghast; cry out on his career.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Leave to thy foes these errors, and these ills;</L>
<L>To nature just, their cause and cure explore.</L>
<L>Not short heav'n's bounty, boundless our expence;</L>
<L>No niggard, nature; men are prodigals.</L>
<L>We waste, not use our time; we breathe, not live.</L>
<L>Time wasted is existence, us'd in life.</L>
<L>And bare existence, man, to live ordain'd,</L>
<L>Wrings, and oppresses with enormous weight.</L>
<L>And why? since time was giv'n for use, not waste,</L>
<L>Injoin'd to fly; with tempest, tide, and stars,</L>
<L>To keep his speed, nor ever wait for man;</L>
<L>Time's use was doom'd a pleasure; waste, a pain;</L>
<L>That man might feel his error, if unseen:</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="015714_0026_0F99DC51278EFFB8"/>
And, feeling, fly to labour for his cure;</L>
<L>Not, blund'ring split, on idleness for ease,</L>
<L>Life's care's are comforts; such by heav'n design'd:</L>
<L>He that has none, must make them, or be wretched▪</L>
<L>Cares are employments; and without employ</L>
<L>The soul is on a rack; the rack of rest,</L>
<L>To souls most adverse, action all their joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here, then, the riddle, mark'd above, unfolds;</L>
<L>Then time turns torment, when man turns a fool.</L>
<L>We rave, we wrestle with great nature's plan;</L>
<L>We thwart the Deity; and 'tis decreed,</L>
<L>Who thwart His will, shall contradict their own:</L>
<L>Hence our unnatural quarrel with ourselves;</L>
<L>Our thoughts at enmity; our bosom broil;</L>
<L>We push time from us, and we wish him back;</L>
<L>Lavish of lustrums, and yet fond of life;</L>
<L>Life we think long, and short; death seek, and shun;</L>
<L>Body and soul, like peevish man and wife,</L>
<L>United jar, and yet are loth to part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh the dark days of vanity! while here,</L>

<L>Gone? they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e'er go; when past, they haunt, us still;</L>
<L>The spirit walks of ev'ry day deceas'd;</L>
<L>And smiles an angel, or a fury frowns.</L>
<L>Nor death, nor life delight us. If time past,</L>
<L>And time postest, both pain us, what can please?</L>
<L>That which the Deity to please ordain'd,</L>
<L>Time us'd. The man who consecrates his hours</L>
<L>By vig'rous effort, and an honest aim,</L>
<L>At once he draws the sting of life and death;</L>
<L>He walks with nature; and her paths are peace.</L>

<L>Our error's cause and cure are seen: She next</L>

<HEAD>THE COMPLAINT. NIGHT THE FOURTH. THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH. CONTAINING Our only CURE for the FEAR of DEATH, AND Proper SENTIMENTS of HEART on that Inestimable Blessing.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Hon. Mr. YORKE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A MUCH-indebted muse, O Yorke! intrudes.</L>
<L>Amid the smiles of fortune, and of youth,</L>
<L>Thine ear is patient of a serious song.</L>
<L>How deep-implanted in the breast of man</L>
<L>The dread of death? I sing its sov'reign cure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why start at death? Where is he? Death arriv'd,</L>
<L>Is past; not come, or gone, He's never here.</L>
<L>Ere hope, sensation fails; black-boding man</L>
<L>Receives, not suffers, death's tremendous blow.</L>
<L>The knell, the shroud, the mattock, and the grave;</L>
<L>The deep damp vault, the darkness, and the worm;</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="015714_0059_0F99DC73F54EF130"/>
These are the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gbears of a Winter's eve,</L>
<L>The terrors of the living, not the dead.</L>
<L>Imagination's fool, and error's wretch,</L>
<L>Man makes a death, which nature never made;</L>
<L>Then on the point of his own fancy falls;</L>
<L>And feels a thousand deaths, in fearing one.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But were death frightful, what has age to sear?</L>
<L>If prudent, age should meet the friendly foe,</L>
<L>And shelter in his hospitable gloom.</L>
<L>I scarce can meet a monument, but holds</L>
<L>My younger; ev'ry date cries—"Come away."</L>
<L>And what recalls me? Look the world around,</L>
<L>And tell me what: The wisest cannot tell.</L>
<L>Should any born of woman give his thought</L>
<L>Full range, on just dislike's unbounded field;</L>
<L>Of things, the vanity; of men, the flaws;</L>
<L>Flaws in the best; the many, flaw all o'er;</L>
<L>As Leopards, spotted, or, as Ethiops, dark;</L>
<L>Vivacious ills; good dying immature;</L>
<L>(How immature, Narcissa's marble tells)</L>
<L>And at its death bequeathing endless pain;</L>
<L>His heart, tho' bold, would sicken at the sight,</L>
<L>And spend itself in sighs, for future scenes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But grant to life (and just it is to grant</L>
<L>To lucky life) some perquisites of joy;</L>
<L>A time there is, when, like a thrice-told tale,</L>
<L>Long-rifled life of sweet can yield no more,</L>
<L>But from our comment on the Comedy,</L>
<L>Pleasing reflections on parts well-sustain'd,</L>
<L>Or purpos'd emendations where we fail'd,</L>
<L>Or hopes of plaudits from our candid judge,</L>
<L>When, on their exit, souls are bid unrobe,</L>
<L>Toss fortune back her tinsel, and her plume,</L>
<L>And drop this mask of flesh behind the scene.</L>

With me, that time is come; my world is dead;</L>
<L>A new world rises▪ and new manners reign:</L>
<L>Foreign Comedians, a spruce band! arrive,</L>
<L>To push me from the scene, or hiss me there.</L>
<L>What a pert race starts up! the strangers gaze,</L>
<L>And I at them; my neighbour is unknown;</L>
<L>Nor that the worst: Ah me! the dire effect</L>
<L>Of loit'ring here, of death defrauded long;</L>
<L>Of old so gracious (and let that suffice,)</L>
<L>My very master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not.—</L>

<L>Shall I dare say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the fate?</L>

<L>An object ever pressing dims the sight,</L>
<L>And hides behind its ardor to be seen.</L>
<L>When in his courtiers ears I pour my plaint,</L>
<L>They drink it as the nectar of the great;</L>
<L>And squeeze my hand, and beg me come to-morrow;</L>
<L>Refusal! canst thou wear a smoother form?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Indulge me, nor conceive I drop my theme:</L>
<L>Who cheapens life, abates the fear of death:</L>
<L>Twice-told the period spent on stubborn Troy,</L>
<L>Court-favour, yet untaken, I besiege;</L>
<L>Ambition's ill-judg'd effort to be rich.</L>
<L>Alas! ambition makes my little, less;</L>
<L>Embitt'ring the possess'd: Why wish for more?</L>
<L>Wishing, of all employments, is the worst;</L>
<L>Philosophy's reverse; and health's decay!</L>
<L>Were I as plump, as stall'd theology,</L>
<L>Wishing would waste me to this shade again.</L>
<L>Were I as wealthy as a South-Sea dream,</L>
<L>Wishing is an expedient to be poor.</L>
<L>Wishing, that constant hectic of a fool;</L>

<L>Here, on a single plank, thrown safe ashore,</L>
<L>I hear the tumult of the distant throng,</L>
<L>As that of seas remote, or dying storms;</L>
<L>And meditate on scenes, more silent still;</L>
<L>Pursue my theme, and fight the fear of death.</L>
<L>Here, like a shepherd gazing from his hut,</L>
<L>Touching his reed, or leaning on his staff,</L>
<L>Eager ambition's fiery chace I see;</L>
<L>I see the circling hunt, of noisy men,</L>
<L>Burst law's inclosure, leap the mounds of right,</L>
<L>Pursuing, and pursu'd, each other's prey;</L>
<L>As Wolves, for rapine; as the Fox, for wiles;</L>
<L>Till death, that mighty hunter, earths them all.</L>

<L>Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?</L>
<L>What, tho' we wade in wealth, or soar in fame?</L>
<L>Earth's highest station ends in, "Here he lies:"</L>
<L>And "Dust to dust" concludes her noblest song.</L>

<HEAD>THE COMPLAINT. NIGHT THE FIFTH. THE RELAPSE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE The Earl of LITCHFIELD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LORENZO! to recriminate is just.</L>
<L>Fondness for fame is avarice of air.</L>
<L>I grant the man is vain who writes for praise.</L>
<L>Praise no man e'er deserv'd, who sought no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As just thy second charge. I grant the muse</L>
<L>Has often blusht at her degen'rate sons,</L>
<L>Retain'd by sense to plead her filthy cause;</L>
<L>To raise the low, to magnify the mean,</L>
<L>And subtilize the gross into refin'd:</L>
<L>As if to magic numbers pow'rful charm</L>
<L>'Twas giv'n, to make a Civet of their song</L>
<L>Obscene, and sweeten ordure to perfume.</L>
<L>Wit, a true Pagan, deifies the brute,</L>
<L>And lifts our Swine-enjoyments from the mire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fact notorious, nor obscure the cause.</L>
<L>We wear the chains of pleasure, and of pride.</L>
<L>These share the man; and these distract him too;</L>
<L>Draw diff'rent ways, and clash in their commands.</L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="015714_0084_0F99DC8ED4EDD960"/>
Pride, like an Eagle, builds among the stars;</L>
<L>But pleasure, Lark like, nests upon the ground.</L>
<L>Joys shar'd by brute-creation, pride resents;</L>
<L>Pleasure embraces: Man would both enjoy,</L>
<L>And both at once: A point how hard to gain!</L>
<L>But, what can't wit, when stung by strong desire?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wit dares attempt this arduous enterprize.</L>
<L>Since joys of sense can't rise to reason's taste</L>
<L>In subtle Sophistry's laborious forge,</L>
<L>Wit hammers out a reason new, that stoops</L>
<L>To sordid scenes, and meets them with applause.</L>
<L>Wit calls the Graces the chaste Zone to loose;</L>
<L>Nor less than a plump God to fill the bowl:</L>
<L>A thousand phantoms, and a thousand spells,</L>
<L>A thousand opiates scatters, to delude,</L>
<L>To fascinate, inebriate, lay asleep,</L>
<L>And the fool'd mind of man delightfully confound.</L>
<L>Thus that which shock'd the judgment, shocks no more▪</L>
<L>That which gave pride offence, no more offends,</L>
<L>Pleasure and pride, by nature mortal foes,</L>
<L>At war eternal, which in man shall reign,</L>
<L>By wit's address, patch up a fatal peace,</L>
<L>And hand in hand lead on the rank debauch,</L>
<L>From rank, refin'd to delicate and gay.</L>
<L>Art, cursed art! wipes off th' indebted blush</L>
<L>From nature's cheek, and bronzes ev'ry shame.</L>
<L>Man smiles in ruin, glories in his guilt,</L>
<L>And infamy stands candidate for praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All writ by man in favour of the soul,</L>
<L>These sensual Ethics, far, in bulk, transcend.</L>
<L>The flow'rs of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loquence, profusely pour'd</L>

<L>Grand-climacterical absurdities!</L>
<L>Grey-hair'd authority, to faults of youth,</L>

<L>Peace and esteem is all that age can hope.</L>
<L>Nothing but wisdom gives the first; the last,</L>

<L>What folly can be ranker? Like our shadows,</L>

<L>Enough to live in tempest, die in port;</L>
<L>Age should fly concourse, cover in retreat</L>

<L>That, like the Jews fam'd oracle of gems,</L>

<L>A blaze betokens brevity of life:</L>
<L>As if bright embers should emit a flame,</L>
<L>Glad spirits sparkled from Narcissa's eye,</L>
<L>And made youth younger, and taught life to live.</L>
<L>As natures opposites wage endless war,</L>
<L>For this offence, as treason to the deep</L>
<L>Inviolable stupor of his reign,</L>
<L>Where lust, and turbulent ambition, sleep,</L>
<L>Death took swift vengeance. As he life detests,</L>
<L>More life is still more odious; and, reduc'd</L>
<L>By conquest, aggrandizes more his pow'r.</L>
<L>But wherefore aggrandiz'd? By heav'n's decree,</L>
<L>To plant the soul on her eternal guard,</L>

<L>Thus runs death's dread commission: "Strike, but so,</L>
<L>"As m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st alarms the living by the dead."</L>
<L>Hence stratagem delights him, and surprise,</L>

<L>He most affects the forms least like himself,</L>
<L>His slender self. Hence burly corpulence</L>
<L>Is his familiar wear, and sleek disguise.</L>
<L>Behind the rosy bloom he loves to lurk,</L>
<L>Or ambush in a smile; or wanton dive</L>
<L>In dimples deep; Love's eddies, which draw in</L>
<L>Unwary hearts, and sink them in despair.</L>

<L>He gave an old vivacious usurer</L>

<L>Of costly linen, tuck'd his filthy shroud.</L>
<L>His crooked bow he straiten'd to a cane;</L>

<L>When, against reason, riot shuts the door,</L>

<LG>
<L>And death's approach (if orthodox my song)</L>

<L>And art thou still a glutton of bright gold?</L>

<L>The conscious forest trembles at the shock,</L>
<L>And hill, and stream, and distant dale, resound.</L>

<L>These high-aim'd darts of death, and these alone,</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FEW ages have been deeper in dispute about religion, than this. The dispute about religion, and the practice of it, seldom go toge∣ther. The shorter, therefore, the dispute, the better. I think it may be reduced to this single question, <HI>Is Man Immortal,</HI> or is he not? If he is not, all our disputes are mere amusements, or trials of skill. In this case, Truth, Reason, Religion, which give our Discourses such pomp and solemnity, are (as will be shewn) mere empty sounds, without any meaning in them. But if man is immortal, it will be∣ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him to be very serious about eternal consequences; or, in other Words, to be truly religious. And this great fundamental truth, unestablished, or unawaken'd in the minds of men, is, I conceive, the real source and support of all our infidelity; how remote soever the particular objections advanced may seem to be from it.</P>
<P>Sensible appearances affect most men much more than abstract reasonings; and we daily see bodies drop around us, but the soul is invisible. The power which inclination has over the judgment, is greater than can be well conceived by those that have not had an experience of it; and of what numbers is it the sad interest, that soul should not survive! The heathen world confessed, that they rather hoped, than firmly believed immortality! and how many heathens have we still amongst us! The sacred page assures us, that life and immortality is brought to light by the gospel: But by how many is the gospel rejected, or overlooked! From these considerations, and from my being, accidentally, privy to the sentiments of some particular persons, I have been long persuaded, that most, if not all, our infidels (whatever name they take, and whatever scheme, for argument's sake, and to keep themselves in countenance, they patronize) are support∣ed in their deplorable error, by some doubt of their immortality, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the bottom. And I am satisfied, that men once thoroughly convinced of their immortality, are not far from being Christians. For it is hard to conceive, that a man fully conscious eternal pain or happi∣ness will certainly be his lot, should not earnestly, and impartially, inquire after the surest means of escaping one, and securing the other. And of such an earnest and impartial inquiry, I well know the con∣sequence.</P>
<P><PB REF="015714_0117_0F99E38F7B4D6198"/>
Here, therefore, in proof of this most fundamental truth, some plain arguments are offered; arguments derived from principles which infidels admit in common with believers; arguments, which appear to me altogether irresistible; and such as, I am satisfied, will have great weight with all, who give themselves the small trouble of looking seriously into their own bosoms, and of observing, with any tolerable degree of attention, what daily passes round about them in the world. If some arguments shall, Here, occur, which others have declined, they are submitted, with all deference, to better judgments in this, of all points, the most important. For, as to the being of a God, that is no longer disputed; but it is undisputed for this reason only, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Because where the least pretence to reason is admitted, it must for ever be indisputable. And of consequence no man can be betrayed into a dispute of that nature by vanity; which has a prin∣cipal share in animating our modern combatants against other articles of our belief.</P>

<HEAD>THE COMPLAINT. NIGHT THE SIXTH. THE INFIDEL Reclaimed. PART THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SHE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Referring to Night the Fifth.</NOTE> (for I know not yet her name in Heaven)</L>
<L>Not early like NARCISSA, left the scene;</L>
<L>Nor sudden, like PHILANDER. What avail?</L>
<L>This seeming mitigation but inflames;</L>
<L>This fancy'd medicine heightens the disease.</L>
<L>The longer known, the closer still she grew;</L>
<L>And gradual parting is a gradual death.</L>
<L>'Tis the grim tyrant's engine, which extorts</L>
<L>By tardy pressure's still-increasing weight,</L>
<L>From hardest hearts, confession of distress.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O the long, dark approach thro' years of pain,</L>
<L>Death's gall'ry! (might I dare to call it so)</L>
<L>With dismal doubt, and sable terror, hung;</L>
<L>Sick Hope's pale lamp, its only glimm'ring ray:</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="015714_0119_0F99E3915FEE9F20"/>
There, fate my melancholy walk ordain'd,</L>
<L>Forbid self-love itself to flatter, there.</L>
<L>How oft I gaz'd, prophetically sad!</L>
<L>How oft I saw her dead, while yet in smiles!</L>
<L>In Smiles she sunk her grief, to lessen mine.</L>
<L>She spoke me comfort, and encreas'd my pain.</L>
<L>Like pow'rful armies trenching at a town,</L>
<L>By slow, and silent, but resistless sap,</L>
<L>In his pale progress gently gaining ground,</L>
<L>Death urg'd his deadly siege; in spite of art,</L>
<L>Of all the balmy blessings nature lends</L>
<L>To succour frail humanity. Ye stars!</L>
<L>(Not now first made familiar to my sight)</L>
<L>And thou, O moon! bear witness; many a night</L>
<L>He tore the pillow from beneath my head,</L>
<L>Ty'd down my sore attention to the shock,</L>
<L>By ceaseless depredations on a life</L>
<L>Dearer than that he left me. Dreadful post</L>
<L>Of observation! darker ev'ry hour!</L>
<L>Less dread the day that drove me to the brink,</L>
<L>And pointed at eternity below;</L>
<L>When my soul shudder'd at futurity;</L>
<L>When, on a moment's point, th' important dye</L>
<L>Of life and death spun doubtful, 'ere it fell,</L>
<L>And turn'd up life; my title to more woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But why more Woe? more comfort let it be.</L>
<L>Nothing is dead, but that which wish'd to die;</L>
<L>Nothing is dead, but wretchedness and pain;</L>
<L>Nothing is dead, but what incumber'd, gall'd,</L>
<L>Block'd up the pass, and barr'd from real life.</L>
<L>Where dwells that wish most ardent of the wise?</L>
<L>Too dark the sun to see it; highest stars</L>
<L>Too low to reach it; death, great death alone,</L>
<L>O'er stars and sun, triumphant, lands us there.</L>
<L><PB N="113" REF="015714_0120_0F99E392202A44A8"/>
Nor dreadful our transition; tho' the mind,</L>
<L>An artist at creating self-alarms,</L>
<L>Rich in experience for inquietude,</L>
<L>Is prone to paint it dreadful. Who can take</L>
<L>Death's portrait true? the tyrant never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at.</L>
<L>Our sketch all random strokes, conjecture all;</L>
<L>Close shuts the grave, nor tells one single tale.</L>
<L>Death, and his image rising in the brain,</L>
<L>Bear faint resemblance; never are alike;</L>
<L>Fear shakes the pencil; fancy loves excess,</L>
<L>Dark ignorance is lavish of her shades:</L>
<L>And these the formidable picture draw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But grant the worst; 'tis past; new prospects rise;</L>
<L>And drop a veil eternal o'er her tomb.</L>
<L>Far other views our contemplation claim,</L>
<L>Views that o'erpay the rigours of our life;</L>
<L>Views that suspend our agonies in death.</L>
<L>Wrapt in the thought of immortality,</L>
<L>Wrapt in the single, the triumphant thought!</L>
<L>Long life might lapse, age unperceiv'd come on;</L>
<L>And find the soul unsated with her theme.</L>
<L>Its nature, proof, importance, fire my song.</L>
<L>O that my song could emulate my soul!</L>
<L>Like her, immortal. No!—the soul disdains</L>
<L>A mark so mean; far nobler hope inflames;</L>
<L>If endless ages can outweigh an hour,</L>
<L>Let not the laurel, but the palm, inspire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy Nature, immortality! who knows?</L>
<L>And yet who knows it not? It is but life</L>
<L>In stronger thread of brighter colour spun,</L>
<L>And spun forever; dipt by cruel fate</L>
<L>In Stygian dye, how black, how brittle here!</L>
<L>How short our correspondence with the sun!</L>
<L>And while it lasts, inglorious! our best deeds,</L>
<L>How wanting in their weight! our highest joys</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="015714_0121_0F99E392E32B18F8"/>
Small cordials to support us in our pain.</L>
<L>And give us strength to suffer. But how great</L>
<L>To mingle int'rests, converse, amities,</L>
<L>With all the sons of reason, scatter'd wide</L>
<L>Thro' habitable space, where-ever born,</L>
<L>Howe'er endow'd! To live free citizens</L>
<L>Of universal nature! to lay hold</L>
<L>By more than feeble faith on the supreme!</L>
<L>To call heav'n's rich unfathomable mines</L>
<L>(Mines, which support archangels in their state)</L>
<L>Our own! to rise in science, as in bliss,</L>
<L>Initiate in the secrets of the skies!</L>
<L>To read creation; read its mighty plan</L>
<L>In the bare bosom of the deity!</L>
<L>The plan, and execution, to collate!</L>
<L>To see, before each glance of piercing thought,</L>
<L>All cloud, all shadow, blown remote! and leave</L>
<L>No mystery—but that of love divine,</L>
<L>Which lifts us on the seraph's flaming wing,</L>
<L>From earth's Aceldama, this field of blood,</L>
<L>Of inward anguish, and of outward ill,</L>
<L>From darkness, and from dust, to such a scene!</L>
<L>Love's element! true joy's illustrious home!</L>
<L>From earth's sad contrast (now deplor'd) more fair!</L>
<L>What exquisite vicissitude of fate!</L>
<L>Blest absolution of our blackest hour!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LORENZO, these are thoughts that make man, man,</L>
<L>The wise illumine, aggrandize the great.</L>
<L>How great (while yet we tread the kindred clod,</L>
<L>And ev'ry moment fear to sink beneath</L>
<L>The clod we tread; soon trodden by our sons)</L>
<L>How great, in the wild whirl of time's pursuits,</L>
<L>To stop, and pause, involv'd in high presage,</L>
<L>Thro' the long visto of a thousand years,</L>
<L>To stand contemplating our distant selves,</L>

<L>And angels emulate; our pride how just!</L>
<L>When mount we? when these shackles cast? when quit</L>

<L>Where virtue reigns, enrich'd with full arrears;</L>

LORENZO, to this heav'nly delphos haste;</L>
<L>And come back all-immortal; all-divine:</L>
<L>Look nature thro', 'tis revolution all;</L>
<L>All change, no death. Day follows night; and night</L>
<L>The dying day; stars rise, and set, and rise;</L>
<L>Earth takes th' example. See, the summer gay,</L>
<L>With her green chaplet, and ambrosial flowers,</L>
<L>Droops into pallid autumn: winter grey,</L>
<L>Horrid with frost, and turbulent with storm,</L>
<L>Blows autumn, and his golden fruits, away:</L>
<L>Then melts into the spring: soft spring, with breth</L>
<L>Favonian, from warm chambers of the south,</L>
<L>Recalls the first. All, to reflourish, fades.</L>
<L>As in a wheel, all sinks, to reascend.</L>
<L>Emblems of man, who passes, not expires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With this minute distinction, emblems just,</L>
<L>Nature revolves, but man advances; both</L>
<L>Eternal, that a circle, this a line.</L>
<L>That gravitates, this soars. Th' aspiring soul</L>
<L>Ardent, and tremulous, like flame, ascends;</L>
<L>Zeal, and humility, her wings to heav'n.</L>
<L>The world of matter, with its various forms,</L>
<L>All dies into new life. Life born from death</L>
<L>Rolls the vast mass, and shall forever roll.</L>
<L>No single atom, once in being, lost,</L>
<L>With change of counsel charges the most high.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What hence infers LORENZO? can it be?</L>
<L>Matter immortal? and shall spirit die?</L>
<L>Above the nobler, shall less noble rise?</L>
<L>Shall man alone, for whom all else revives,</L>
<L>No resurrection know? shall man alone,</L>

<L>Less privileg'd than grain, on which he feeds?</L>

<L>Here, dormant matter waits a call to life:</L>

<L>There, sense from reason steals a glimm'ring ray;</L>
<L>Reason shines out in man. But how preserv'd</L>
<L>The chain unbroken upward, to the realms</L>
<L>Of incorporeal life? those realms of bliss,</L>
<L>Where death hath no dominion? grant a make</L>
<L>Half-mortal, half immortal; earthy, part;</L>
<L>And part ethereal; grant the soul of man</L>
<L>Eternal; or in man the series ends.</L>
<L>Wide yawns the gap; connexion is no more;</L>
<L>Checkt reason halts; her next step wants support;</L>

<L>Thus far, all nature calls on thy belief.</L>

<L>Rather than violate his league with death?</L>
<L>Renounce his reason, rather than renounce</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS we are at war with the power, it were well if we were at war with the manners, of France. A land of levity, is a land of guilt. A serious mind is the native soil of every virtue; and the single charac∣ter that does true honor to mankind. The soul's immortality has been the favourite theme with the serious of all ages. Nor is it strange; it is a subject by far the most interesting, and important, that can enter the mind of man. Of highest moment this subject always was, and always will be. Yet this its highest moment seems to admit of increase, at this day; a sort of occasional importance is superadded to the natural weight of it; if that opinion which is ad∣vanced in the Preface to the preceding Night, be just. It is there supposed, that all our infidels, whatever scheme, for argument's sake, and to keep themselves in countenance, they patronize, are betray'd into their deplorable error, by some doubt of their immortality, at the bottom. And the more I consider this point, the more I am per∣suaded of the truth of that opinion. Tho' the distrust of a futurity is a strange error; yet it is an error into which bad men may naturally be distressed. For it is impossible to bid defiance to final ruin, with∣out some refuge in imagination, some presumption of escape. And what presumption is there? There are but two in nature; but two, within the compass of human thought. And these are,—That either God will not, or can not punish. Considering the divine attributes, the first is too gross to be digested by our strongest wishes. And since omnipotence is as much a divine attribute as holiness, that God cannot punish, is as absurd a supposition, as the former. God cer∣tainly can punish, as long as the wicked man exists. In non-existence, therefore, is their only refuge; and, consequently, non-existence is their strongest wish. And strong wishes have a strange influence on our opinions; they bias the judgment in a manner, almost, incredi∣ble. And since on this member of their alternative, there are some very small appearances in their favour, and none at all on the other, they catch at this reed, they lay hold on this chimaera, to save them∣selves from the shock, and horror, of an immediate, and absolute, despair.</P>
<P><PB REF="015714_0145_0F99E3ADDB626428"/>
On reviewing my subject, by the light which this argument, and others of like tendency, threw upon it, I was more inclin'd than ever, to pursue it; as it appeared to me to strike directly at the main root of all our infidelity. In the following pages, it is, accordingly, pur∣sued at large; and some arguments for immortality, new (at least, to me,) are ventured on in them. There also the writer has made an attempt to set the gross absurdities and horrors of annihilation in a fuller and more affecting view, than is (I think) to be met with else∣where.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, for whose sake this attempt was chiefly made, profess great admiration for the wisdom of heathen antiquity: What pity 'tis, they are not sincere! If they were sincere, how would it mortify them to consider, with what contempt, and abhorrence, their notions would have been received, by those whom they so much ad∣mire? What degree of contempt, and abhorrence, would fall to their share, may be conjectured by the following matter of fact (in my opinion) extremely memorable. Of all their heathen worthies, So∣crates ('tis well known) was the most guarded, dispassionate, and com∣posed: Yet this great master of temper was angry; and angry at his last hour; and angry with his friend; and angry for what deserv'd acknowledgment; angry, for a right and tender instance of true friendship towards him. Is not this surprising? What could be the cause? The cause was for his honour; it was a truly noble, tho', perhaps, a too punctilious, regard for immortality: For his friend asking him, with such an affectionate concern as became a friend, <HI>Where he should deposit his remains?</HI> it was resented by Socrates, as implying a dishonourable supposition, that He could be so mean, as to have a regard for any thing, even in himself, that was not immortal.</P>
<P>This fact well consider'd, would make our infidels withdraw their admiration from Socrates; or make them endeavour, by their imita∣tion of this illustrious example, to share his glory: And, consequently, It would incline them to peruse the following pages with candor and impartiality: Which is all I desire; and that, for their sakes: For I am persuaded, that an unprejudiced infidel must, necessarily, receive some advantageous impressions from them.</P>

<HEAD>CONTENTS of the Seventh Night.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Sixth Night arguments were drawn, from nature, in proof of immortality: Here, others are drawn from man: From his dis∣content, p. 141; from his passions and powers, 142; from the gradual growth of reason, ibid. from his fear of death, ibid. from the nature of hope, 143; and of virtue, 144, &amp;c. from knowledge, and love, as being the most essential properties of the soul, 147; from the order of creation, 148; from the nature of ambition, 149, &amp;c. Avarice, 152, 153; Pleasure, 153. A digression on the grandeur of the passi∣ons, 154, 155. Immortality alone renders our present state intelli∣gible, 156. An objection from the Stoics disbelief of immortality answered, 156, 157. Endless questions unresolvable, but on supposi∣tion of our immortality, 157, 158. The natural, most melancholy, and pathetic complaint of a worthy man under the persuasion of no futurity, 159, &amp;c. The gross absurdities and horrors of annihilation urg'd home on Lorenzo, 163, &amp;c. The soul's vast importance, 168, &amp;c. from whence it arises, 171, 172.

The necessary punishment of the false, 177. Man's ruin is from himself, ibid. An infidel accuses himself of guilt, and hypocrisy; and that of the worst sort, 178. His obligation to christians, ibid. What danger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e incurs by virtue, 179. Vice recommended to him, 180. His high pretences to virtue, and benevolence, exploded, ibid. The conclusion, on the nature of faith, ibid. Reason, 181; and Hope, 181, 182; with an apology for this attempt, 182.</P>

<HEAD>THE COMPLAINT. NIGHT THE SEVENTH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HEAV'N gives the needful, but neglected, call.</L>
<L>What day, what hour, but knocks at human hearts,</L>
<L>To wake the soul to sense of future scenes?</L>
<L>Deaths stand, like Mercurys, in ev'ry way;</L>
<L>And kindly point us to our journey's end.</L>
<L>POPE, who couldst make immortals! art thou dead?</L>
<L>I give thee joy: nor will I take my leave;</L>
<L>So soon to follow. Man but dives in death;</L>
<L>Dives from the sun, in fairer day to rise;</L>
<L>The grave, his subterranean road to bliss.</L>
<L>Yes, infinite indulgence plann'd it so;</L>
<L>Thro' various parts our glorious story runs;</L>
<L>Time gives the preface, endless age unrolls</L>
<L>The volume (ne'er unroll'd!) of human fate,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This, earth and skies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Night the Sixth.</NOTE> already have proclaim'd.</L>
<L>The world's a prophecy of worlds to come;</L>
<L>And who, what GOD foretels (who speaks in things,</L>
<L>Still louder than in words) shall dare deny?</L>
<L>If nature's arguments appear too weak,</L>
<L>Turn a new leaf, and stronger read in man.</L>
<L>If man sleeps on, untaught by what he sees,</L>
<L>Can he prove infidel to what he feels?</L>
<L>He, whose blind thought futurity denies,</L>
<L>Unconscious, bears, BELLEROPHON! like thee,</L>
<L>His own indictment; he condemns himself;</L>
<L>Who reads his bosom, reads immortal life;</L>
<L>Or, nature, there, imposing on her sons,</L>
<L>Has written fables; man was made a lye.</L>

<PB N="142" REF="015714_0148_0F99E3B282546F80"/>
<L>Why discontent for ever harbour'd there?</L>
<L>Incurable consumption of our peace!</L>
<L>Resolve me, why, the cottager, and king,</L>
<L>He whom sea-sever'd realms obey, and he</L>
<L>Who steals his whole dominion from the waste,</L>
<L>Repelling winter blasts with mud and straw,</L>
<L>Disquieted alike, draw sigh for sigh,</L>
<L>In fate so distant, in complaint so near?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is it, that things terrestrial can't content?</L>
<L>Deep in rich pasture, will thy flocks complain?</L>
<L>Not so; but to their master is deny'd</L>
<L>To share their sweet serene. Man, ill at ease,</L>
<L>In this, not his own place, this foreign field,</L>
<L>Where nature fodders him with other food,</L>
<L>Than was ordain'd his cravings to suffice,</L>
<L>Poor in abundance, famish'd at a feast,</L>
<L>Sighs on for something more, when most enjoy'd.</L>
<L>Is Heav'n then kinder to thy flocks, than thee?</L>
<L>Not so; thy pasture richer, but remote;</L>
<L>In part, remote; for that remoter part</L>
<L>Man bleats from instinct, tho', perhaps, debauch'd</L>
<L>By sense, his reason sleeps, nor dreams the cause.</L>
<L>The cause how obvious, when his reason wakes!</L>
<L>His grief <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s but his grandeur in disguise;</L>
<L>And discontent is immortality.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall sons of AEther, shall the blood of Heaven,</L>
<L>Set up their hopes on earth, and stable here,</L>
<L>With brutal acquiescence in the mire?</L>
<L>LORENZO! no! they shall be nobly pain'd;</L>
<L>The glorious foreigners, distrest, shall sigh</L>
<L>On thrones; and thou congratulate the sigh:</L>
<L>Man's misery declares him born for bliss;</L>
<L>His anxious heart asserts the truth I sing,</L>
<L>And gives the sceptic in his head the lye.</L>

<L>Our heads, our hearts, our passions, and our powers,</L>
<L>Speak the same language; call us to the skies:</L>
<L>Unripen'd these in this inclement clime,</L>
<L>Scarce rise above conjecture, and mistake;</L>
<L>And for this land of trifles those too strong</L>
<L>Tumultuous rise, and tempest human life:</L>
<L>What prize on earth can pay us for the storm?</L>
<L>Meet objects for our passions Heav'n ordain'd,</L>
<L>Objects that challenge all their fire and leave</L>
<L>No fault, but in defect: blest Heav'n! avert</L>
<L>A bounded ardor for unbounded bliss;</L>
<L>O for a bliss unbounded! far beneath</L>
<L>A soul immortal, is a mortal joy.</L>
<L>Nor are our pow'rs to perish immature;</L>
<L>But, after feeble effort here, beneath</L>
<L>A brighter sun, and in a nobler soil,</L>
<L>Transplanted from this sublunary bed,</L>
<L>Shall flourish fair, and put forth all their bloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Reason progressive, instinct is complete;</L>
<L>Swift instinct leaps; slow reason feebly climbs.</L>
<L>Brutes soon their zenith reach; their little all</L>
<L>Flows in at once; in ages they no more</L>
<L>Could know, or do, or covet, or enjoy.</L>
<L>Were man to live coeval with the sun</L>
<L>The Patriarch-pupil would be learning still;</L>
<L>Yet, dying, leave his lesson half-unlearnt.</L>
<L>Men perish in advance, as if the sun</L>
<L>Should set ere noon, in eastern oceans drown'd;</L>
<L>If fit, with dim, illustrious to compare,</L>
<L>The sun's meridian, with the soul of man.</L>
<L>To man, why, stepdame nature! so severe?</L>
<L>Why thrown aside thy master-piece half-wrought,</L>
<L>While meaner efforts thy last hand enjoy?</L>
<L>Or, if abortively poor man must die,</L>
<L>Nor reach, what reach he might, why die in dread?</L>
<L><PB N="144" REF="015714_0150_0F99E3B3E4466C38"/>
Why curst with foresight? wise to misery?</L>
<L>Why of his proud prerogative the prey?</L>
<L>Why less pre-eminent in rank, than pain?</L>
<L>His immortality alone can tell;</L>
<L>Full ample fund to balance all amiss,</L>
<L>And turn the scale in favour of the just!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His immortality alone can solve</L>
<L>That darkest of AEnigmas, human hope;</L>
<L>Of all the darkest, if a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> death we die.</L>
<L>Hope, eager hope, th' assassin of our joy,</L>
<L>All present blessings treading under-foot,</L>
<L>Is scarce a milder tyrant than despair.</L>
<L>With no past toils content, still planning new,</L>
<L>Hope turns us o'er to death alone for ease.</L>
<L>Possession, why, more tasteless than pursuit?</L>
<L>Why is a wish far dearer than a crown?</L>
<L>That wish accomplish'd, why, the grave of bliss?</L>
<L>Because, in the great future bury'd deep,</L>
<L>Beyond our plans of empire, and renown,</L>
<L>Lies all that man with ardor should pursue;</L>
<L>And he who made him, bent him to the right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Man's heart th' ALMIGHTY to the future sets,</L>
<L>By secret and inviolable springs;</L>
<L>And makes his hope his sublunary joy.</L>
<L>Man's heart eats all things, and is hungry still;</L>
<L>"More, more!" the glutton cries: for something new</L>
<L>So rages appetite, if man can't mount,</L>
<L>He will descend. He starves on the possest.</L>
<L>Hence, the world's master, from ambition's spire,</L>
<L>In caprea plung'd; and div'd beneath the brute.</L>
<L>In that rank sty why wallow'd empire's son</L>
<L>Supreme? because he could not higher fly;</L>
<L>His riot was ambition in despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Old Rome consulted birds; LORENZO! thou</L>
<L>With more success, the flight of hope survey;</L>
<L><PB N="143" REF="015714_0151_0F99E3B4F524D3F0"/>
Of restless hope, for ever on the wing.</L>
<L>High-perch'd o'er ev'ry thought that Falcon sits,</L>
<L>To fly at all that rises in her sight;</L>
<L>And, never stooping, but to mount again</L>
<L>Next moment, she betrays her aim's mistake,</L>
<L>And owns her quarry lodg'd beyond the grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There should it fail us (it must fail us there,</L>
<L>If being fails), more mournful riddles rise,</L>
<L>And virtue vies with hope in mystery.</L>
<L>Why virtue? where its praise, its being, fled?</L>
<L>Virtue is true self-interest pursu'd:</L>
<L>What true self-interest of quite-mortal man?</L>
<L>To close with all that makes him happy here,</L>
<L>If vice (as sometimes) is our friend on earth,</L>
<L>Then vice is virtue; 'tis our sov'reign good.</L>
<L>In self-applause is virtue's golden prize;</L>
<L>No self-applause attends it on thy scheme:</L>
<L>Whence self-applause? from conscience of the right.</L>
<L>And what is right, but means of happiness?</L>
<L>No means of happiness when virtue yields;</L>
<L>That basis failing, falls the building too,</L>
<L>And lays in ruin ev'ry virtuous joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The rigid guardian of a blameless heart,</L>
<L>So long rever'd, so long reputed wise,</L>
<L>Is weak; with rank knight-errantries o'er-run.</L>
<L>Why beats thy bosom with illustrious dreams</L>
<L>Of self-exposure, laudable and great?</L>
<L>Of gallant enterprize, and glorious death?</L>
<L>Die for thy country?—thou romantic fool!</L>

<L>Why reason made accomplice in the cheat?</L>

<L>While o'er us, in tremendous judgment sit</L>
<L>Far more than man, with endless praise, and blame,</L>

<LG>
<L>Ambition's boundless appetite outspeaks</L>
<L>The verdict of its shame. When souls take fire</L>
<L>At high presumptions of their own desert,</L>
<L>One age is poor applause; the mighty shout,</L>
<L>The thunder by the living few begun,</L>
<L>Late time must echo; worlds unborn, resound.</L>

<L>Wild dream! which ne'er had haunted human thought,</L>
<L>Had not our natures been eternal too.</L>
<L>Instinct points out an int'rest in hereafter;</L>
<L>But our blind reason sees not where it lies;</L>
<L>Or, seeing, gives the substance for the shade.</L>

<L>Tho' disappointments in ambition pain,</L>
<L>And tho' success disgusts; yet still, LORENZO!</L>

<L>Than reason his ambition. Man must soar.</L>
<L>An obstinate activity within,</L>
<L>An insuppressive spring, will toss him up</L>
<L>In spite of fortune's load. Not Kings alone,</L>
<L>Each villager has his ambition too;</L>
<L>No Sultan prouder than his fetter'd slave:</L>
<L>Slaves build their little Babylons of straw.</L>
<L>Echo the proud Assyrian, in their hearts,</L>

<L>And souls immortal must forever heave</L>

<L>The praise of mortals, or the praise of Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor absolutely vain is human praise,</L>
<L>When human is supported by divine.</L>
<L>I'll introduce LORENZO to himself;</L>
<L>Pleasure and pride (bad masters!) share our hearts.</L>
<L>As love of pleasure is ordain'd to guard</L>
<L>And feed our bodies, and extend our race;</L>
<L>The love of praise is planted to protect;</L>
<L>And propagate the glories of the mind.</L>
<L>What is it, but the love of praise, inspires,</L>
<L>Matures, refines, embellishes, exalts,</L>
<L><PB N="151" REF="015714_0159_0F99E3BD9C5DDF10"/>
Earth's happiness? from that, the delicate,</L>
<L>The grand, the marvellous, of civil life.</L>
<L>Want and convenience, under-workers, lay</L>
<L>The basis, on which love of glory builds.</L>
<L>Nor is thy life, O virtue! less in debt</L>
<L>To praise, thy secret stimulating friend.</L>
<L>Were men not proud, what merit should we miss!</L>
<L>Pride made the virtues of the Pagan world.</L>
<L>Praise is the salt that seasons right to man,</L>
<L>And whets his appetite for moral good.</L>
<L>Thirst of applause is virtue's second guard;</L>
<L>Reason, her first; but reason wants an aid;</L>
<L>Our private reason is a flatterer;</L>
<L>Thirst of applause calls public judgment in,</L>
<L>To poise our own, to keep an even scale,</L>
<L>And give endanger'd virtue fairer play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here a fifth proof arises, stronger still:</L>
<L>Why this so nice construction of our hearts?</L>
<L>These delicate moralities of sense;</L>
<L>This constitutional reserve of aid</L>
<L>To succour virtue, when our reason fails;</L>
<L>If virtue, kept alive by care and toil,</L>
<L>And, oft, the mark of injuries on earth,</L>
<L>When labour'd to maturity (its bill</L>
<L>Of disciplines, and pains, unpaid) must die?</L>
<L>Why freighted rich, to dash against a rock?</L>
<L>Were man to perish when most fit to live,</L>
<L>O how mis-spent were all these stratagems,</L>
<L>By skill divine in woven in our frame?</L>
<L>Where are Heav'n's holiness and mercy fled?</L>
<L>Laughs Heav'n, at once, at virtue, and at man?</L>
<L>If not, why that discourag'd, this destroy'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus far ambition. What says avarice?</L>
<L>This her chief maxim, which has long been thine:</L>

<L>To guide that instinct, reason! is thy charge;</L>
<L>'Tis thine to tell us where true treasure lies:</L>
<L>But, reason failing to discharge her trust,</L>
<L>Or to the deaf discharging it in vain,</L>

<L>" Thou shalt not covet," is a wise command;</L>
<L>But bounded to the wealth the sun surveys:</L>
<L>Look farther, the command stands quite revers'd,</L>
<L>And av'rice is a virtue most divine.</L>
<L>Is faith a refuge for our happiness?</L>
<L>Most sure: And is it not for reason too?</L>
<L>Nothing this world unriddles, but the next.</L>
<L>Whence inextinguishable thirst of gain?</L>
<L>From inextinguishable life in man:</L>
<L>Man, if not meant, by worth, to reach the skies,</L>
<L>Had wanted wing to fly so far in guilt.</L>
<L>Sour grapes, I grant, ambition, avarice:</L>
<L>Yet still their root is immortality,</L>

<L>Refine, exalt, throw down their pois'nous lee,</L>
<L>And make them sparkle in the bowl of bliss.</L>

<LG>
<L>See, the third witness laughs at bliss remote,</L>

<L>Why should the joy most poignant sense affords,</L>
<L>Burn us with blushes, and rebuke our pride?—</L>
<L>Those heav'n-born blushes tell us man descends,</L>
<L>Ev'n in the zenith of his earthly bliss:</L>
<L>Should reason take her infidel repose,</L>
<L>This honest instinct speaks our lineage high;</L>
<L>This instinct calls on darkness to conceal</L>
<L>Our rapturous relation to the stalls.</L>
<L>Our glory covers us with noble shame,</L>
<L>And he that's unconfounded, is unmann'd.</L>
<L>The man that blushes, is not quite a brute.</L>
<L>Thus far with thee, LORENZO! will I close,</L>
<L>Pleasure is good, and man for pleasure made;</L>
<L>But pleasure full of glory, as of joy;</L>
<L>Pleasure, which neither blushes, nor expires.</L>

<L>As yet, I'll neither triumph, nor despair:</L>
<L>But hope, ere long, my midnight dream will wake</L>
<L>Your hearts, and teach your wisdom—to be wise:</L>
<L>For why should souls immortal, made for bliss,</L>
<L>E'er wish (and wish in vain!) that souls could die?</L>
<L>What ne'er can die, oh! grant to live; and crown</L>
<L>The wish, and aim, and labour of the skies;</L>
<L>Increase, and enter on the joys of Heaven:</L>
<L>Thus shall my title pass a sacred seal,</L>
<L>Receive an imprimatur from above,</L>
<L>While angels shout—An Infidel reclaim'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To close, LORENZO! spite of all my pains,</L>
<L>Still seems it strange, that thou shouldst live for ever?</L>
<L>Is it less strange, that thou shouldst live at all?</L>
<L>This is a miracle; and that no more.</L>
<L>Who gave beginning, can exclude an end.</L>
<L>Deny thou art: Then, doubt if thou shalt be.</L>
<L>A miracle with miracles inclos'd,</L>
<L><PB N="180" REF="015714_0188_0F99E3DC6F686DC8"/>
Is man: and starts his faith at what is strange?</L>
<L>What less than wonders, from the wonderful;</L>
<L>What less than miracles, from GOD, can flow?</L>
<L>Admit a GOD—that mystery supreme!</L>
<L>That cause uncaus'd! all other wonders cease;</L>
<L>Nothing is marvellous for him to do:</L>
<L>Deny him—all is mystery besides;</L>
<L>Millions of mysteries! each darker far,</L>
<L>Than that thy wisdom would, unwisely, shun.</L>
<L>If weak thy faith, why chuse the harder side?</L>
<L>We nothing know, but what is marvellous;</L>
<L>Yet what is marvellous, we can't believe.</L>
<L>So weak our reason, and so great our GOD,</L>
<L>What most surprises in the sacred page,</L>
<L>Or full as strange, or stranger, must be true.</L>
<L>Faith is not reason's labour, but repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To faith, and virtue, why so backward man?</L>
<L>From hence:—The present strongly strikes us all;</L>
<L>The future, faintly: can we, then, be men?</L>
<L>If men, LORENZO! the reverse is right.</L>
<L>Reason is man's peculiar: sense, the brute's.</L>
<L>The present is the scanty realm of sense;</L>
<L>The future, reason's empire unconfin'd:</L>
<L>On that expending all her godlike power,</L>
<L>She plans, provides, expatiates, triumphs, there;</L>
<L>There builds her blessings! there, expects her praise;</L>
<L>And nothing asks of fortune, or of men.</L>
<L>And what is reason? be she, thus, defin'd;</L>
<L>Reason is upright stature in the soul.</L>
<L>Oh! be a man;—and strive to be a GOD.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" For what? (thou sayst): to damp the joys of life?"</L>
<L>No; to give heart and substance to thy joys.</L>
<L>That tyrant, hope, mark, how she domineers;</L>
<L>She bids us quit realities, for dreams;</L>
<L>Safety, and peace, for hazard, and alarm;</L>
<L><PB N="181" REF="015714_0189_0F99E3DD1BD79040"/>
That tyrant o'er the tyrants of the soul,</L>
<L>She bids ambition quit its taken prize,</L>
<L>Spurn the luxuriant branch on which it sits,</L>
<L>Tho' bearing crowns, to spring at distant game;</L>
<L>And plunge in toils and dangers—for repose.</L>
<L>If hope precarious, and of things, when gain'd,</L>
<L>Of little moment, and as little stay,</L>
<L>Can sweeten toils and dangers into joys;</L>
<L>What then, that hope, which nothing can defeat,</L>
<L>Our leave unask'd? rich hope of boundless bliss!</L>
<L>Bliss, past man's pow'r to pain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it; time's, to close</L>

<L>This hope is earth's most estimable prize:</L>
<L>This is man's portion, while no more than man:</L>
<L>Hope, of all passions, most befriends us here;</L>
<L>Passions of prouder name befriend us less.</L>
<L>Joy has her tears▪ and transport has her death;</L>
<L>Hope, like a cordial, innocent, tho' strong,</L>

<L>Nor makes him pay his wisdom for his joys;</L>
<L>'Tis all, our present state can safely bear,</L>

<L>A joy attemper'd! a chastis'd delight!</L>

<L>Man of the world! (for such wouldst thou be call'd)</L>
<L>And art thou proud of that inglorious style?</L>
<L>Proud of reproach? for a reproach it was,</L>
<L>In antient days; and christian,—in an age,</L>
<L>When men were men, and not asham'd of Heaven,</L>
<L>Fir'd their ambition, as it crown'd their joy,</L>

<L>Should roll in bosoms, where a spirit burns,</L>
<L>Bound for eternity! in bosoms read</L>

<L>Heav'n sells all pleasure; effort is the price:</L>

<L>Can joy, unbottom'd in reflection, stand?</L>

<L>Behold a sun, he spies a deity;</L>
<L>What makes them only smile, makes him adore.</L>
<L>Where they see mountains, he but atoms sees;</L>
<L>An empire, in his balance, weighs a grain.</L>
<L>They things terrestrial worship, as divine;</L>
<L>His hopes immortal blow them by, as dust,</L>
<L>That dims his sight, and shortens his survey,</L>

<L>Titles and honors (if they prove his fate)</L>
<L>He lays aside to find his dignity;</L>
<L>No dignity they find in ought besides.</L>
<L>They triumph in externals (which conceal</L>
<L>Man's real glory), proud of an eclipse.</L>
<L>Himself too much he prizes to be proud,</L>
<L>And nothing thinks so great in man, as man.</L>
<L>Too dear he holds his int'rest, to neglect</L>
<L>Another's welfare, or his right invade;</L>
<L>Their int'rest, like a lion, lives on prey</L>
<L>They kindle at the shadow of a wrong;</L>
<L>Wrong he sustains with temper, looks on Heaven,</L>
<L>Nor stoops to think his injurer his foe;</L>
<L>Nought, but what wounds his virtue, wounds his peace.</L>
<L>A cover'd heart their character defends;</L>
<L><PB N="216" REF="015714_0223_0F99E29323442708"/>
A cover'd heart denies him half his praise.</L>
<L>With nakedness his innocence agrees;</L>
<L>While their broad foliage testifies their fall.</L>
<L>Their no joys end, where his full feast begins;</L>
<L>His joys create, theirs murder, future bliss.</L>
<L>To triumph in existence, his alone,</L>

<L>Death, then, was welcome; yet life still is sweet.</L>

<L>But nothing charms LORENZO, like the firm,</L>
<L>Undaunted breast—And whose is that high praise?</L>
<L>They yield to pleasure, tho' they danger brave,</L>
<L>And shew no fortitude, but in the field;</L>
<L>If there they shew it, 'tis for glory shewn;</L>
<L>Nor will that cordial always man their hearts.</L>
<L>A cordial his sustains, that cannot fail;</L>
<L>By pleasure unsubdu'd, unbroke by pain,</L>
<L>He shares in that omnipotence he trusts.</L>
<L>All-bearing, all-attempting, till he falls;</L>
<L>And when he falls, writes VICI on his shield.</L>
<L>From magnanimity, all fear above;</L>
<L>From nobler recompence, above applause;</L>
<L>Which owes to man's short out look all its charms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Backward to credit what he never felt,</L>
<L>LORENZO cries,—"Where shines this miracle?</L>
<L>"From what root rises this immortal man?"</L>
<L>A root that grows not in LORENZO's ground;</L>
<L>The root dissect, nor wonder at the flower.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He follows nature (not like<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 207. Line 23.</NOTE> thee) and shews us</L>
<L>An uninverted system of a man.</L>
<L>His appetite wears reason's golden chain,</L>
<L>And finds, in due restraint, its luxury.</L>
<L>His passion, like an eagle well-reclaim'd,</L>
<L><PB N="217" REF="015714_0224_0F99E293EFAAA300"/>
Is taught to fly at nought, but infinite.</L>
<L>Patient his hope, un-anxious is his care,</L>
<L>His caution fearless, and his grief (if grief</L>
<L>The Gods ordain) a stranger to despair.</L>
<L>And why?—Because affection, more than meet,</L>
<L>His wisdom leaves not disengag'd from Heav'n.</L>
<L>Those secondary goods that smile on earth,</L>
<L>He, loving in proportion, loves in peace.</L>
<L>They most the world enjoy, who least admire.</L>
<L>His understanding 'scapes the common cloud</L>
<L>Of fumes, arising from a boiling breast.</L>
<L>His head is clear, because his heart is cool,</L>
<L>By worldly competions uninflam'd.</L>
<L>The moderate movements of his soul admit</L>
<L>Distinct ideas, and matur'd debate,</L>
<L>An eye impartial, and an even scale;</L>
<L>Whence judgment sound, and unrepenting choice.</L>
<L>Thus, in a double sense, the good are wise;</L>
<L>On its own dunghill, wiser than the world.</L>
<L>What, then, the world? it must be doubly weak;</L>
<L>Strange truth! as soon would they believe their creed.</L>

<L>Yet thus it is; nor otherwise can be;</L>
<L>So far from aught romantic, what I sing.</L>
<L>Bliss has no being, virtue has no strength</L>
<L>But from the prospect of immortal life.</L>
<L>Who think earth all, or (what weighs just the same)</L>
<L>Who care no farther, must prize what it yields;</L>
<L>Fond of its fancies, proud of its parades.</L>
<L>Who thinks earth nothing, can't its charms admire;</L>
<L>He can't a foe, tho' most malignant, hate,</L>
<L>Because that hate would prove his greater foe.</L>
<L>'Tis hard for them (yet who so loudly boast</L>
<L>Good-will to men?) to love their dearest friend;</L>
<L>For may not he invade their good supreme,</L>
<L>Where the least jealousy turns love to gall?</L>

All shines to them, that for a season shines.</L>
<L>Each act, each thought, he questions, "what its weight,</L>
<L>"Its colour what, a thousand ages hence?"—</L>
<L>And what it there appears, he deems it now.</L>
<L>Hence, pure are the recesses of his soul.</L>
<L>The God-like man has nothing to conceal.</L>
<L>His virtue, constitutionally deep,</L>
<L>Has habit's firmness, and affection's flame;</L>
<L>Angels, ally'd, descend to feed the fire;</L>

Pernicious talent! flatter'd by the world,</L>

<L>The lucky flash; and madness rarely fails.</L>
<L>Whatever cause the spirit strongly stirs,</L>
<L>Confers the bays, and rivals thy renown.</L>

<L>Chance often hits it; and, to pique thee more,</L>

<L>How rare! in senates, synods, sought in vain;</L>
<L>Or if there found, 'tis sacred to the few;</L>
<L>While a lewd prostitute to multitudes,</L>

<L>Wit makes an enterpriser; sense, a man.</L>
<L>Wit hates authority; commotion loves,</L>

<L>In states, 'tis dangerous; in religion, death:</L>
<L>Shall wit turn christian, when the dull believe?</L>
<L>Sense is our helmet, wit is but the plume;</L>
<L>The plume exposes, 'tis our helmet saves.</L>
<L>Sense is the di'mond, weighty, solid, sound;</L>

'Tis Heav'n's last effort of good-will to man;</L>
<L>When pain can't bless, Heav'n quits us in despair.</L>
<L>Who fails to grieve, when just occasion calls,</L>
<L>Or grieves too much, deserves not to be blest;</L>
<L>Inhuman, or effeminate, his heart;</L>
<L>Reason absolves the grief, which reason ends.</L>
<L>May Heav'n ne'er trust my friend with happiness,</L>
<L>Till it has taught him how to bear it well,</L>
<L>By previous pain; and made it safe to smile!</L>
<L>Such smiles are mine, and such may they remain;</L>
<L>Nor hazard their extinction, from excess.</L>
<L>My change of heart a change of style demands;</L>
<L>The CONSOLATION cancels the COMPLAINT,</L>

<L>As when o'er-labour'd, and inclin'd to breathe,</L>

<L>Some small ascent has gain'd, he turns him round,</L>
<L>And measures with his eye the various vale,</L>
<L>The fields, woods, meads, and rivers, he has past;</L>
<L>And, satiate of his journey, thinks of home</L>
<L>Endear'd by distance, nor affects more toil;</L>
<L>Thus I, tho' small, indeed, is that ascent</L>
<L>The muse has gain'd, review the paths she trod;</L>
<L>Various, extensive, beaten but by few:</L>
<L>And, conscious of her prudence in repose,</L>
<L>Pause; and with pleasure meditate an end,</L>
<L>Tho' still remote; so fruitful is my theme.</L>
<L>Thro' many a field of moral and divine,</L>
<L>The muse has stray'd; and much of sorrow seen</L>
<L>In human ways; and much of false and vain;</L>
<L>Which none, who travel this bad road, can miss.</L>
<L>O'er friends deceas'd full heartily she wept;</L>
<L>Of love divine the wonders she display'd;</L>
<L>Prov'd man immortal; shew'd the source of joy;</L>
<L>The grand tribunal rais'd; assign'd the bounds</L>

Of human grief: in few, to close the whole,</L>
<L>The moral muse has shadow'd out a sketch,</L>
<L>Though not in form, nor with a RAPHAEL-stroke,</L>
<L>Of most our weakness needs believe, or do,</L>
<L>In this our land of travel, and of hope,</L>

<L>That, narrow views betray to misery:</L>
<L>That, wise it is to comprehend the whole:</L>
<L>That, virtue rose from nature, ponder'd well,</L>
<L>The single base of virtue built to Heaven:</L>
<L>That, GOD, and nature, our attention cla'm:</L>
<L>That, nature is the glass reflecting GOD,</L>

<L>Too glorious to be gaz'd on in his Sphere:</L>
<L>That, mind, immortal loves immortal aims:</L>
<L>That, boundless mind affects a boundless space:</L>
<L>That, vast Surveys, and the Sublime of things,</L>
<L>The Soul assimilate, and make her great:</L>
<L>That, therefore, Heav'n her glories, as a fund</L>
<L>Of inspiration, thus spreads out to man.</L>
<L>Such are their doctrines; such the night inspir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And what more true? what truth of greater weight?</L>
<L>The Soul of man was made to walk the skies;</L>
<L>Delightful outlet of her prison here!</L>
<L>There, disincumber'd from her chains, the ties</L>

<L>And, undeluded, grasp at something great.</L>
<L>Nor, as a stranger, does she wander there;</L>
<L>But, wonderful herself, thro' wonder strays;</L>

<L>Dives deep in their oeconomy divine,</L>
<L>Sits high in judgment on their various laws,</L>

<L>Hence greatly pleas'd, and justly proud, the Soul</L>
<L>Grows conscious of her birth celestial; breathes</L>
<L>More life, more vigour, in her native air;</L>
<L>And feels herself at home among the Stars;</L>
<L>And feeling, emulates her country's praise.</L>

<L>What call we, then, the firmament, LORENZO?—</L>
<L>As earth the body, since the Skies sustain</L>

<L>Which there expatiates, strengthens, and exults,</L>
<L>And riots thro' the luxuries of thought.</L>

<HEAD>NOTES. ON the BOOK of JOB.</HEAD>
<P>IT is disputed among the Critics who was the Author of the Book of <HI>Job.</HI> Some give it to <HI>Moses;</HI> some to others. As I was en∣gag'd in this little Performance, some Arguments occur'd to me, which favour the former of these Opinions; which Arguments I have flung into the following Notes, where little else is to be expected.</P>
<P>Page 297. <HI>Thrice Happy</HI> Job, &amp;c.] The Almighty's Speech, Chapter xxxviii. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is what I paraphrase in this little Work, is by much the finest Part of the noblest, and most antient Poem in the World. Bishop <HI>Patrick</HI> says, its Grandeur is as much above all other Poetry, as Thunder is louder than a Whisper. In order to set this distinguish'd Part of the Poem in a fuller Light, and give the Reader a clearer Conception of it, I have abridg'd the preceding and subsequent Parts of the Poem, and join'd them it; so that this Piece is a sort of an Epitome of the whole Book of <HI>Job.</HI></P>
<P>I use the Word <HI>Paraphrase,</HI> because I want another which might better answer to the uncommon Liberties I have taken. I have omitted, added, and transpos'd. The <HI>Mountain,</HI> the <HI>Comet,</HI> the <HI>Sun,</HI> and other Parts, are entirely added: The <HI>Peacock,</HI> the <HI>Lion,</HI> &amp;c are much inlarg'd: And I have thrown the Whole into a Method more suitable to our Notions of Regularity. The judicious, if they compare this Piece with the Original, will, I flatter myself, find the Reasons for the great Liberties I have indulg'd myself in through the Whole.</P>
<P><HI>Longinus</HI> has a Chapter on Interrogations, which shews that they contribute much to the Sublime. This Speech of the Almighty is made up of them. Interrogation seems indeed the proper Style of Majesty incens'd. It differs from other manner of Reproof, as bid∣ding a Person execute himself, does from a common Execution; for he that asks the Guilty a proper Question, makes him, in effect, pass Sentence on himself.</P>

Probably this most noble Part of it, the Almighty speaking out of the Whirlwind (so suitable to the After-practice of the <HI>Greek</HI> Stage. when there happened <HI>Dignus Vindice Nodus),</HI> is fictitious; but it is a Fiction more agreeable to the Time in which <HI>Job</HI> lived, than to any since. Frequent, be∣fore the Law, were the Appearances of the Almighty after this man∣ner, <HI>Exodus ch. xix. Ezekiel</HI> ch i <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence is He said to <HI>dwell in think Darkness: And have his Way in the Whirlwind.</HI></P>
<P>Page 299. <HI>Thus far thy floating Tide,</HI> &amp;c.] There is a very great Air in all that precedes; but this is signally Sublime. We are struck with Admiration to see the vast and ungovernable Ocean receiving Commands, and punctually obeying them; to find it like a manag'd Horse, raging, tossing, and foaming, but by the Rule and Direction of its Master This Passage yields in Sublimity to that of <HI>Let there be Light,</HI> &amp;c. so much only, as the absolute Government of Nature yields to the Creation of it.</P>
<P>The like Spirit in these two Passages is no bad concurrent Argu∣ment, that <HI>Moses</HI> is Author of the Book of <HI>Job.</HI></P>
<P>Page 303.] <HI>When, pain'd with hunger, the wild Raven's brood,</HI> &amp;c] Another Argument that <HI>Moses</HI> was the Author, is, that most of the Creatures here mention'd are <HI>Egyptian.</HI> The reason given why the Raven is particularly mentioned as an object of the Care of Providence, is, because, by her clamorous and importunate Voice, she particularly seems always always calling upon it; <HI>to ask earnestly,</HI> AElian. 1. ii. e. 48. And since there were Ravens on the Banks of the <HI>Nile</HI> more clamorous than the rest of that Species, Those probably are meant in this Place.</P>
<P>Page 303. <HI>Who in the cruel Ostrich has subdu'd,</HI> &amp;c] There are many Instances of this Bird's Supidity; let two suffice.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It covers its Head in the Reeds, and thinks itself all out of Sight.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>—<HI>Stat lumine clause</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ridendum revoluta caput: creditque latere,</HI></L>

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They that go in Pursuit of them, draw the Skin of an Ostrich's Neck on one Hand, which proves a sufficient Lure to take them with the other.</P>

<P>They have so little Brain, that <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> had six hundred Heads for his Supper.</P>
<P>Here we may observe, that our Judicious as well as Sublime Author, just touches the great Points of Distinction in each Creature, and then hastens to another. A Description is exact when you cannot <HI>add,</HI> but what is common to another thing; nor <HI>withdraw,</HI> but something peculiarly belonging to the thing describ'd. A <HI>Likeness</HI> is lost in too much Description, as a <HI>Meaning</HI> often in too much Illustration.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>What time she skims along the Field,</HI> &amp;c.] Here is mark'd another <HI>Peculiar</HI> Quality of this Creature, which neither flies, nor runs distinctly, but has a Motion compos'd of both, and, using its Wings as Sails, makes great Speed.</P>

<P>Ibid. <HI>How rich the Peacock,</HI> &amp;c.] Though this Bird is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> just mention'd in my Author, I could not forbear going a little far∣ther, and spreading those beautiful Plumes (which are there shut up) into half a dozen Lines. The circumstance I have marked of his opening his Plumes to the Sun is true. <HI>Expandit colores adverso maxime soli quia sic fulgentius radiant.</HI> Plin. 1. x. c. 20.</P>

<P>And the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> in regard to its Swiftness, made it their Sym∣bol for the Wind; for which Reason we may suppose the Hawk, as well as the Crow <HI>above,</HI> to have been a Bird of Note in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>

Page 304. <HI>Thence wide o'er Nature takes her dread Survey,</HI> &amp;c] The Eagle is said to be of so acute a Sight, that when she is so high in Air, that Man cannot see her, she can discern the smallest Fish under Water. My Author accurately understood the Nature of the Creatures he describes, and seems to have been a Naturalist as well as a Poet, which the next Note will confirm.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Know'st thou how many Moons, by Me assign'd,</HI> &amp;c.] The Meaning of this Question is, Know'st thou the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Circumstances</HI> of their bringing forth? for to know the Time only was easy, and had nothing extraordinary in it; but the Circumstances had some∣thing peculiarly expressive of God's Providence, which makes the Question proper in this Place. <HI>Pliny</HI> observes, that the Hind with Young is by Instinct directed to a certain Herb called <HI>Seselis,</HI> which facilitates the Birth. Thunder also (which looks like the more im∣mediate Hand of Providence) has the same Effect. <HI>Ps.</HI> xxix. In so early an Age to observe these things may stile our Author a Naturalist.</P>
<P>Page 305. <HI>Survey the Warlike Horse,</HI> &amp;c.] The Description of the Horse is the most celebrated of any in the Poem. There is an excellent Critique on it in the <HI>Guardians.</HI> I shall therefore only ob∣serve, that, in this Description as in other Parts of this Speech, our <HI>Vulgar Translation</HI> has much more Spirit than the Septuagint; it al∣ways takes the Original in the most poetical and exalted Sense, so that most Commentators, even on the <HI>Hebrew</HI> itself, fall beneath it.</P>
<P>Page 305. <HI>By the pale Moon they take their destin'd Round.</HI>] Pur∣suing their Prey by Night is true of most wild Beasts, particularly the Lion, <HI>Ps.</HI> civ. V. 20.

tho' some Commentators of Name strain hard in this Place for a new Construction, through fear of it.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Go to the Nile, and from its fruitful Side,</HI> &amp;c.] The taking the Crocodile is most difficult, <HI>Diodorus</HI> says they are not to be taken but by Iron Nets. When <HI>Augustus</HI> conquer'd <HI>Egypt,</HI> he struck a Medal, the Impress of which was a Crocodile chain'd to a Palm-Tree, with this Inscription, <HI>Nemo antea religavit.</HI></P>
<P>Page 307. <HI>The rashest dare not rouze him up,</HI> &amp;c.] This alludes to a custom of this Creature, which is, when sated with Fish, to come ashore, and sleep among the Reeds.</P>
<P>Ibid. —<HI>Behold, Destruction yawns, his spacious Jaws unfold,</HI> &amp;c.] The Crocodile's Mouth is exceeding wide. When he gapes, says <HI>Pliny, Fit totum Os. Martial</HI> says to his old Woman,
<Q><L><HI>Cum comparata rictibus tuis ora</HI></L>
<L><HI>Niliacus habet crocodilus angusta.</HI></L></Q>
So that the Expression here is barely just.</P>
<P>Page 308. <HI>Fate issues from his Jaws in Streams of Fire.</HI>] This too is nearer Truth than at first View may be imagin'd. The Cro∣codile, say the Naturalists, lying long under Water, and being there forced to hold its Breath, when it emerges, the Breath long represt is hot, and bursts out so violently, that it resembles Fire and Smoke. The Horse suppresses not his Breath by any means so long, neither is he so fierce and animated; yet the most correct of Poets ventures to use the same Metaphor concerning him.</P>
<P><HI>Collectumque</HI> premens <HI>volvit sub naribus</HI> ignem. By this and the foregoing Note I would caution against a false Opi∣nion of the Eastern boldness, from Passages in them ill understood.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Large is his Front; and, when his burnish'd Eyes,</HI> &amp;c.] <HI>His Eyes are like the Eyelids of the Morning.</HI> I think this gives us as great an Image of the Thing it would express, as can enter the Thought of Man. It is not improbable, that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> stole their Hieroglyphic for the Morning, which is the Crocodile's Eye, from this Passage, though no Commentator I have seen mentions it. It is easy to conceive how the <HI>Egyptians</HI> should be both Readers and Admirers of the Writings of <HI>Moses,</HI> whom I suppose the Author of this Poem.</P>
<PB N="316" REF="015714_0321_0F99E19D2486E038"/>
<P>I have observed already, that three or four of the Creatures here described are <HI>Egpptian;</HI> the two last are notoriously so; they are the River-Horse and the Crocodile, those celebrated Inhabitants of the <HI>Nile;</HI> and on these two it is that our Author chiefly dwells. It would have been expected from an Author more remote from that River than <HI>Moses,</HI> in a Catalogue of Creatures produc'd to magnify their Creator, to have dwelt on the two largest Works of his Hand, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Elephant and the Whale: This is so natural an Expectation, that some Commentators have rendered <HI>Behemoth</HI> and <HI>Leviathan,</HI> the Elephant and Whale, tho' the Descriptions in our Author will not admit of it; but <HI>Moses</HI> being (as we may well suppose) under an immediate Terror of the <HI>Hippopotamos</HI> and Crocodile from their daily Mischiefs and Ravages around him, it is very accountable why he should permit them to take place.</P>

<HEAD>To a LADY, with the LAST DAY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>HERE, sacred truths, in lofty numbers told,</L>
<L>The prospect of a future state unfold:</L>
<L>The realms of night to mortal view display,</L>
<L>And the glad regions of eternal day.</L>
<L>This daring author scorns, by vulgar ways</L>
<L>Of guilty wit, to merit worthless praise.</L>
<L>Full of her glorious theme, his tow'ring muse,</L>
<L>With gen'rous zeal a nobler flame pursues:</L>
<L>Religion's cause her ravisn'd heart inspires,</L>
<L>And with a thousand bright ideas fires;</L>
<L>Transports her quick, impatient, piercing eye,</L>
<L>O'er the strait limits of mortality,</L>
<L>To boundless orbs, and bids her fearless soar</L>
<L>Where only Milton gain'd renown before;</L>
<L>Where various scenes alternately excite</L>
<L>Amazement, pity, terror, and delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus did the muses sing in early times,</L>
<L>Ere skill'd to flatter vice, and varnish crimes:</L>
<L>Their lyres were tun'd to virtuous songs alone,</L>
<L>And the chaste poet, and the priest, were one.</L>
<L>But now, forgetful of their infant state,</L>
<L>They soothe the wanton pleasures of the great:</L>
<L>And from the press, and the licentious stage,</L>
<L>With luscious poison taint the thoughtless age;</L>
<L>Deceitful charms attract our wond'ring eyes,</L>
<L>And specious ruin unsuspected lyes.</L>
<L>So the rich soil of <HI>India's</HI> blooming shores,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with lavish nature's choicest stores,</L>
<L>Where serpents lurk, by flow'rs conceal'd from sight,</L>
<L>Hides fatal danger under gay delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These purer thoughts, from gross alloys refin'd,</L>
<L>With heav'nly raptures elevate the mind:</L>
<L><PB REF="015714_0324_0F99E19F74016678"/>
Not fram'd to raise a giddy short-liv'd joy,</L>
<L>Whose false allurements, while they please, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>story;</L>
<L>But bliss resembling that of saints above,</L>
<L>Sprung from the vision of th' Almighty love:</L>
<L>Firm, solid bliss, for ever great and new,</L>
<L>The more 'tis known, the more admir'd, like you;</L>
<L>Like you, fair nymph, in whom united meet</L>
<L>Endearing sweetness, unaffected wit,</L>
<L>And all the glories of your sparkling race,</L>
<L>While inward virtues heighten ev'ry grace.</L>
<L>By these secur'd, you will with pleasure read</L>
<L>" Of future judgment, and the rising dead;</L>
<L>" Of time's grand period, heav'n and earth o'erthrown;</L>
<L>" And gasping nature's last tremendous groan."</L>
<L>These, when the stars and sun shall be no more,</L>
<L>Shall beauty to your ravag'd form restore:</L>
<L>Then shall you shine with an immortal ray,</L>
<L>Improv'd by death, and brighten'd by decay.</L>

<L>AND must it be as thou hast sung,</L>

<L>Will there no trace, no point be found</L>

<L>On nature's self destruction prey?</L>
<L>Then fame, the most immortal thing</L>

<L>Beyond, what laurels can there be,</L>
<L>For <HI>Homer, Horace, Pope,</HI> or <HI>thee?</HI></L>
<L>Thro' life we chase, with fond pursuit,</L>
<L>What mocks our hope, like <HI>Sodom'</HI>s fruits</L>
<L>And sure, thy plan was well design'd,</L>
<L>To cure this madness of the mind;</L>
<L>First, beyond time, our thoughts to raise;</L>

<L>And fame's a breath, and men are dust.</L>

<L>NOW let the <HI>atheist</HI> tremble; thou alone</L>
<L>Canst bid his conscious heart the Godhead own.</L>
<L>Whom shalt thou not reform? O thou hast seen,</L>
<L>How God descends to judge the souls of men!</L>
<L>Thou heardst the sentence, how the guilty mourn,</L>
<L>Driv'n out from GOD, and never to return?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet more behold ten thousand thunders fall,</L>
<L>And sudden vengeance wrap the flaming ball:</L>
<L>When nature sunk, when every bolt was hurl'd,</L>
<L>Thou sawst the boundless ruins of the world.</L>

<L>When guilty <HI>Sodom</HI> felt the burning rain,</L>
<L>And sulphur fell on the devoted plain;</L>
<L>The <HI>patriarch</HI> thus, the fiery tempest past,</L>
<L>With pious horror view'd the desart waste;</L>
<L>The restless smoke still wav'd its curls around,</L>
<L>For ever rising from the glowing ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But tell me, oh! What heavenly pleasure tell,</L>
<L>To think so greatly, and describe so well!</L>
<L>How waft thou pleas'd the wond'rous theme to try,</L>
<L>And find the thought of man could rise so high?</L>
<L>Beyond this world the labour to pursue,</L>
<L>And open all ETERNITY to view?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But thou art best delighted to rehearse</L>
<L>Heav'ns holy dictates in exalted verse;</L>
<L>O thou hast pow'r the harden'd heart to warm,</L>
<L>To grieve, to raise, to terrify, to charm!</L>
<L>To fix the soul on GOD; to teach the mind</L>
<L>To know the dignity of human-kind;</L>

<L>NOW man awakes, and from his silent bed,</L>
<L>Where he has slept for ages, lifts his head;</L>
<L>Shakes off the slumber of ten thousand years,</L>
<L>And on the borders of new worlds appears.</L>
<L>Whate'er the bold, the rash adventure cost,</L>
<L>In wide eternity I dare be lost.</L>
<L>The muse is wont in narrow bounds to sing,</L>
<L>To teach the Swain, or celebrate the King;</L>

<L>I lift my voice, and sing to human-kind:</L>

<L>Again the trumpet's intermitted Sound</L>
<L>Rolls the wide circuit of creation round,</L>
<L>An universal concourse to prepare</L>
<L>Of all that ever breath'd the vital air;</L>
<L>In some wide field, which active whirlwinds sweep,</L>
<L>Drive cities, forests, mountains to the deep,</L>

To smoothe and lengthen out th' unbounded Space,</L>
<L>And spread an area for all human race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now monuments prove faithful to their trust,</L>
<L>And render back their long committed dust.</L>
<L>Now charnels rattle; scattered limbs, and all</L>
<L>The various bones, obsequious to the call,</L>
<L>Self-mov'd advance; the neck perhaps to meet</L>
<L>The distant head, the distant legs the feet.</L>
<L>Dreadful to view, see through the dusky sky</L>
<L>Fragments of bodies in confusion fly,</L>
<L>To distant regions journeying, there to claim</L>
<L>Deserted members, and complete the frame.</L>

<L>When the world bow'd to Rome's almighty Sword,</L>
<L>Rome bow'd to Pompey, and confess'd her lord,</L>
<L>Yet one day lost, this deity below</L>
<L>Became the Scorn and pity of his foe.</L>
<L>His blood a traitor's sacrifice was made,</L>
<L>And smoak'd indignant on a ruffian's blade.</L>
<L>No trumpet's Sound, no gasping army's yell,</L>
<L>Bid with due horror his great Soul farewel.</L>
<L>Obscure his fall! all welt'ring in his gore,</L>

<L>The trumpet's Sound each vagrant mote shall hear;</L>

<L>Obey the signal wafted in the wind,</L>
<L>And not one sleeping atom lag behind.</L>

<L>So swarming beer, that on a Summer's day</L>

<L>" Forbid it! and oh! grant, great GOD, at least</L>
<L>" This one, this slender, almost no request;</L>
<L>" When I have wept a thousand lives away,</L>
<L>" When torment is grown weary of its prey,</L>

<L>Deep anguish! but too late; the hopeless Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>Bound to the bottom of the burning pool,</L>
<L>Though loth, and ever loud blaspheming owns</L>
<L>He's justly doom'd to pour eternal groans;</L>
<L>Enclos'd with horrors, and transfix'd with pain,</L>
<L>Rolling in vengeance, struggling with his chain;</L>
<L>To talk to fiery tempests, to implore</L>
<L>The raging flame to give its burnings o'er,</L>
<L><PB N="354" REF="015714_0357_0F99E1C652B790A0"/>
To toss, to writhe, to pant beneath his load,</L>
<L>And bear the weight of an offended GOD.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The favour'd of their Judge in triumph move</L>
<L>To take possession of their thrones above;</L>
<L>Satan's accurs'd desertion to supply,</L>
<L>And fill the vacant stations of the sky;</L>
<L>Again to kindle long-extinguish'd rays,</L>
<L>And with new lights dilate the heav'nly blaze;</L>
<L>To crop the roses of immortal youth,</L>
<L>And drink the fountain-head of sacred truth;</L>
<L>To swim in seas of bliss, to strike the string,</L>
<L>And lift the voice to their Almighty KING;</L>
<L>To lose eternity in grateful lays,</L>
<L>And fill Heav'n's wide circumference with praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But I attempt the wondrous height in vain,</L>
<L>And leave unfinish'd the too lofty strain:</L>
<L>What boldly I begin, let others end;</L>
<L>My strength exhausted, fainting I descend,</L>
<L>And chuse a less, but no ignoble theme,</L>
<L>Dissolving elements, and worlds in flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fatal period, the great hour is come,</L>
<L>And nature shrinks at her approaching doom;</L>
<L>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ud peals of thunder give the sign, and all</L>
<L>Heav'n's terrors in array surround the ball;</L>
<L>Sharp lightnings with the meteors blaze conspire,</L>
<L>And darted downward set the world on fire;</L>
<L>Black rising clouds the thicken'd aether choke,</L>
<L>And spiry flames shoot thro' the rolling Smoke,</L>
<L>With keen vibrations cut the sullen night,</L>
<L>And strike the darken'd sky with dreadful light;</L>
<L>From Heav'n's four regions, with immortal force,</L>
<L>Angels drive on the winds impetuous course,</L>
<L>T' enrage the flame; it spreads, it soars on high,</L>
<L>Swells in the storm, and billows thro' the sky.</L>
<L><PB N="355" REF="015714_0358_0F99E1C6604D5538"/>
Here winding pyramids of fire ascend,</L>
<L>Cities and desarts in one ruin blend;</L>
<L>Here blazing volumes wafted overwhelm</L>
<L>The spacious face of a far distant realm:</L>
<L>There, undermin'd, down rush eternal hills,</L>
<L>The neighb'ring vales the vast destruction fills.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hear'st thou that dreadful crack, that sound which</L>
<L>Like peals of thunder, and the centre shook [broke</L>
<L>What wonders must that groan of nature tell!</L>
<L>Olympus there, and mightier Atlas fell,</L>
<L>Which seem'd above the reach of sate to stand,</L>
<L>A tow'ring monument of GOD's right hand;</L>
<L>Now dust and Smoke, whose brow so lately spread</L>
<L>O'er shelter'd countries its diffusive shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shew me that celebrated Spot, where all</L>
<L>The various rulers of the sever'd ball</L>
<L>Have humbly sought wealth, honour, and redress,</L>
<L>That land which Heav'n seem'd diligent to bless,</L>
<L>Once call'd Britannia; can her glories end?</L>
<L>And can't surrounding Seas her realms defend?</L>
<L>Alas, in flames behold surrounding Seas!</L>
<L>Like oil their waters but augment the blaze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some angels say, where ran proud Asia's bound.</L>
<L>Or where with fruits was fair Europe crown'd?</L>
<L>Where stretch'd waste Lybia? where did India's store</L>
<L>Sparkle in diamonds, and her golden ore?</L>
<L>Each lost in each, their mingling kingdoms glow,</L>
<L>And all dissolv'd, one fiery deluge flow:</L>
<L>Thus earth's contending monarchies are join'd,</L>
<L>And a full period of ambition find.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now whate'er or swims, or walks, or files,</L>
<L>Inhabitants of Sea, or earth, or skies;</L>
<L>All on whom Adam's wisdom fix'd a name,</L>
<L>All plunge and perish in the conqu'ring flame.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="356" REF="015714_0359_0F99E1C71F51A788"/>
<L>This globe alone would but defraud the fire,</L>
<L>Starve its devouring rage: the flakes aspire,</L>
<L>And catch the clouds, and make the heavens their prey;</L>
<L>The Sun, the Moon, the Stars all melt away,</L>
<L>All, all is lost; no monument, no sign,</L>
<L>Where once so proudly blaz'd the gay machine.</L>
<L>So bubbles on the foaming stream expire,</L>
<L>So sparks that scatter from the kindling fire;</L>
<L>The devastations of one dreadful hour,</L>
<L>The great Creator's six days work devour.</L>
<L>A mighty mighty ruin! yet one soul</L>
<L>Has more to boast, and far outweighs the whole;</L>
<L>Exalted in superior excellence,</L>
<L>Casts down to nothing such a vast expence.</L>
<L>Have ye not seen th' eternal mountains nod,</L>
<L>An earth dissolving, a descending GOD?</L>
<L>What strange surprizes through all nature ran?</L>
<L>For whom these revolutions, but for man?</L>
<L>For him Omnipotence new measures takes;</L>
<L>For him through all eternity awakes;</L>
<L>Pours on him gifts sufficient to supply</L>
<L>Heav'n's loss, and with fresh glories fill the sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think deeply then, O man, how great thou art,</L>
<L>Pay thyself homage with a trembling heart;</L>
<L>What angels guard, no longer dare neglect,</L>
<L>Slighting thyself, affront not GOD's respect:</L>
<L>Enter the sacred temple of thy breast,</L>
<L>And gaze, and wander there a ravish'd guest:</L>
<L>Gaze on those hidden treasures thou shalt find,</L>
<L>Wander thro' all the glories of thy mind.</L>
<L>Of prefect knowledge, see, the dawning light</L>
<L>Foretels a noon most exquisitely bright!</L>
<L>Here springs of endless joy are breaking forth!</L>
<L>There buds the promise of celestial worth!</L>
<L><PB N="357" REF="015714_0360_0F99E1CB4AC36AB8"/>
Worth which must ripen in a happier clime</L>
<L>And brighter sun, beyond the bounds of time.</L>
<L>Thou, minor, can'st not guess thy vast estate,</L>
<L>What stores on foreign coasts thy landing wait.</L>
<L>Lose not thy claim, let virtue's paths be trod;</L>
<L>Thus glad all heav'n, and please that bounteous GOD;</L>
<L>Who, to light thee to pleasures, hung on high</L>
<L>Yon radiant orb, proud regent of the sky:</L>
<L>That service done, its beams shall fade away,</L>
<L>And GOD shine forth in one eternal day.</L>
