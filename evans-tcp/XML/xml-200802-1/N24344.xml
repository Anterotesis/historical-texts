<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is merely in compliance with custom I sit down to write a Preface. Dr. <HI>Goldsmith'</HI>s writings need not an eulogium at this hour: they may be compared to the invaluable paintings of <HI>Raphael;</HI> the longer they are in the world, their estimation becomes more extensive. Time has drawn the veil of ob∣livion over the works of many writers, once renowned (if we may credit tradition) for every perfection that captivates. Nature was certainly wanting to enrich those com∣positions. What she has had a hand in, Time reverences, and a final dissolution can only destroy. How happy, then, must the hallowed spirit of <HI>Goldsmith</HI> be, whose Beau∣ties wear the simple brilliancy of Nature,
<PB N="iv" REF="032200_0003_0FF1834FED0204B8"/>
and all the decorative charms of Fancy! whose praise is the theme of the ingenious, from the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>London.</HI></NOTE> Capital of Taste and Patronage, to the cottage of learned tranquillity, and which Time will for ever regard with pa∣rental affection!</P>
<P>The Pictures I have given from his Poems, are the highest finished in the group; and the whole selection will be found, it is hoped, meriting the attention and patronage of the refined lovers of ele∣gant and estimable literature.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M. B.</HEAD>
<P>FAME, the only inflexible friend of Genius, has been singularly kind to the Author whose life I with much pleasure sit down to give some ac∣count of. She has sounded the praises of her favourite to the extremities of taste and literary refinement. The Court and the Cottage share with equal felicity the invaluable fruits of his elegant studies! The smallest memorial is a beacon for the incautious heart of virtue and simplicity, or a balm for the wounded soul of the comfortless! Hence the lovers of human excellence have been sedulous in establishing our writer's reputation on the basis of immortality.</P>
<P><HI>Goldsmith'</HI>s biographers have been many; their opinions, in some measure, different; but they all agree that he was a man of elevated genius, unbounded philanthropy, and possessing the milk
<PB N="vi" REF="032200_0004_0FF183542F7CB148"/>
of human kindness in a supereminent degree. I have their several accounts before me; and, upon an impartial survey, Dr. <HI>Glover'</HI>s stands highest in my estimation. He was <HI>Goldsmith'</HI>s intimate friend, a companion in many of his literary pursuits, and his enthusiastic admirer! What such a writer says, as far as relates to facts, must be listened to with more pleasure than a mere work of fiction, however elaborate, or splendidly set off. It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the obligations I lie under to this ingenious and excellent companion, for many particulars relative to Dr. <HI>Goldsmith.</HI> I shall give his account entire, marked with double commas,</P>
<P>"<HI>OLIVER GOLDSMITH</HI> was born at <HI>Roscommon,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the year 1731. His father, who possessed a small estate in that coun∣ty, had nine sons, of which <HI>Oliver</HI> was the third. He was originally intended for the church; and with that view, after being well instructed in the classics, was, with his brother the Rev. <HI>Henry Goldsmith,</HI> placed in <HI>Trinity</HI> col∣lege, <HI>Dublin,</HI> about the latter end of the year 1749. In this seminary of learning he continu∣ed a few years, when he took a Bachelor's degree; but his brother not being able to obtain any preferment after he left the college, <HI>Oliver,</HI> by the advice of Dean <HI>Goldsmith,</HI> of <HI>Cork,</HI> turned his thoughts to the profession of physic, and,
<PB N="vii" REF="032200_0004_0FF183542F7CB148"/>
after attending some courses of anatomy in <HI>Dub∣lin,</HI> proceeded to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the year 1751, where he studied the several branches of medi∣cine under the different Professors in that univer∣sity, which was deservedly ranked among the first schools of physic in <HI>Europe.</HI> His benefi∣cent disposition soon involved him in unexpected difficulties, and he was obliged precipitately to leave <HI>Scotland,</HI> in consequence of engaging him∣self to pay a considerable sum of money for a fellow-student.</P>
<P>"A few days after, about the beginning of the year 1754, he arrived at <HI>Sunderland,</HI> near <HI>Newcastle,</HI> where he was arrested at the suit of one <HI>Barclay,</HI> a taylor in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to whom he had given security for his friend. By the good graces of <HI>Laughlin Maclane,</HI> <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR> and Dr. <HI>Sleigh,</HI> who were then in the college, he was soon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his passage on board a <HI>Dutch</HI> ship to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> whence, after a short stay, he proceed∣ed to <HI>Brussels.</HI> He then visited great part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and, after passing some time at <HI>Stras∣bourg</HI> and <HI>Lovain,</HI> where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in Physic, he accompanied an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> gentleman to <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P>"It is undoubtedly fact, that this ingenious, unfortunate man, made most part of his tour on foot! He had left <HI>England</HI> with very little mo∣ney; and, being of a philosophical turn, and at
<PB N="viii" REF="032200_0005_0FF18357089F0030"/>
that time possessing a body capable of sustaining every fatigue, and a heart not easily terrified at danger, he became an enthusiast to the design he had formed of seeing the manners of different countries. He had some knowledge of the <HI>French</HI> language, and of music; he played tole∣rably well on the <HI>German</HI> flute; which, from an amusement, became at some times the means of subsistence. His learning produced him an hos∣pitable reception at most of the religious houses, and his music made him welcome to the peasants of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> 'Whenever I ap∣proached a peasant's house towards night-fall,' he used to say, 'I played one of my most mer∣ry tunes, and that generally procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day: but in truth,' (his constant expression) 'I must own, whenever I attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank, they always thought my per∣formance odious, and never made me any re∣turn for my endeavours to please them.'</P>
<P>"On his arrival at <HI>Geneva,</HI> he was recom∣mended as a proper person for a travelling tutor to a young man, who had been unexpectedly left a considerable sum of money by his uncle, Mr. <HI>S</HI>—. This youth, who was articled to an attorney, on receipt of his fortune, deter∣mined to see the world; and, on his engaging with his preceptor, made a proviso, that he should be permitted to govern himself; and our
<PB N="ix" REF="032200_0005_0FF18357089F0030"/>
traveller soon found his pupil understood the art of directing in money concerns extremely well, as avarice was his prevailing passion</P>
<P>"During <HI>Goldsmith'</HI>s continuance in <HI>Switzer∣land,</HI> he assiduously cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given some striking proofs at the college of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> It was from hence he sent the first sketch of his delightful epistle, called <HI>The Traveller,</HI> to his bother, the clergy∣man, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who, giving up fame and for∣tune, had retired, with an amiable wife, to happiness and obscurity, on an income of only 401. a year.</P>
<P>"From <HI>Geneva,</HI> Mr. <HI>Goldsmith</HI> and his pupil visited the South of <HI>France,</HI> where the young man, upon some disagreement with his preceptor, paid him the small part of his salary which was due, and embarked at <HI>Marseilles</HI> for <HI>England.</HI> Our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large, and passed through a number of difficulties in traversing the greatest part of <HI>France.</HI> At length, his curiosity being grati∣fied, he bent his course towards <HI>England,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Dover,</HI> the beginning of the winter, in the year 1758.</P>
<P>"His finances were so low on his return to <HI>England,</HI> that he with difficulty got to the me∣tropolis, his whole stock of cash amounting to no more than a few halfpence! An entire stran∣ger in <HI>London,</HI> his mind was filled with the
<PB N="x" REF="032200_0006_0FF18358A1106AA0"/>
most gloomy reflections, in consequence of his embarrassed situation! He applied to several apothecaries, in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman; but his broad <HI>Irish</HI> accent, and the uncouthness of his appearance, occasioned him to meet with insult from most of the medicinal tribe. The next day, how∣ever, a chymist near <HI>Fish-street,</HI> struck with his forlorn condition, and the simplicity of his man∣ner, took him into his laboratory, where he continued till he discovered his old friend Dr. <HI>Sleigh</HI> was in <HI>London.</HI> This gentleman received him with the warmest affection, and liberally invited him to share his purse till some establish∣ment could be procured for him. <HI>Goldsmith,</HI> unwilling to be a burthen to his friend, a short time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him, to assist the late Rev. Dr. <HI>Milner,</HI> in instructing the young gentlemen at the academy at <HI>Peckham;</HI> and acquitted himself greatly to the Doctor's satisfaction for a short time; but, having obtained some reputation by the criticisms he had written in the <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> Mr. <HI>Griffiths,</HI> the principal proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of it; and, resolving to pur∣sue the profession of writing, he returned to <HI>London,</HI> as the mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and re∣ward. Here he determined to adopt a plan of the strictest oeconomy, and took lodgings in
<PB N="xi" REF="032200_0006_0FF18358A1106AA0"/>
<HI>Green-Arbour Court,</HI> in the <HI>Old-Bailey,</HI> where he wrote several ingenious pieces. The late Mr. <HI>Newbery,</HI> who at that time gave great encour∣agement to men of literary abilities, became a kind of patron to our young author, and intro∣duced him as one of the writers in the <HI>Public Ledger,</HI> in which his <HI>Citizen of the World</HI> ori∣ginally appeared, under the title of '<HI>Chinese Letters.</HI>'</P>
<P>"<HI>Fortune</HI> now seemed to take some notice of a man she had long neglected. The simplicity of his character, the integrity of his heart, and the merit of his productions, made his company very acceptable to a number of respectable per∣sons; and he emerged from his shabby apart∣ments near the <HI>Old-Bailey</HI> to the politer air of the <HI>Temple,</HI> where he took handsome chambers, and lived in a genteel style. The publication of his <HI>Traveller,</HI> his <HI>Vicar of Wakefield,</HI> and his <HI>Letters on the History of England,</HI> was fol∣lowed by the performance of his comedy of <HI>The Good-natured Man,</HI> at <HI>Covent-garden</HI> theatre, and placed him in the first rank of the poets of the present age.</P>
<P>"Our Doctor, as he was now universally call∣ed, had a constant levee of his distressed coun∣trymen; whose wants, as far as he was able, he always relieved; and he has been often known to leave himself even without a guinea, in order to supply the necessities of others!</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="032200_0007_0FF1835A8F8E3550"/>
"Another feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader. Previous to the publication of his <HI>Deserted Village,</HI> the bookseller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy; which the Doctor mentioned, a few hours after, to one of his friends, who ob∣served it was a very great sum for so short a performance. 'In truth,' replied <HI>Goldsmith,</HI> 'I think so too; it is much more than the honest man can afford, or the piece is worth; I have not been easy since I received it; therefore I will go back and return him his note;' which he absolutely did, and left it entirely to the book∣seller to pay him according to the profits pro∣duced by the sale of the poem, which turned out very considerable.</P>
<P>"During the last rehearsal of his comedy, intitled, <HI>She Stoops to Conquer,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Col∣man</HI> had no opinion would succeed, on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of <HI>Tony Lampkin'</HI>s speeches, being apprehensive it might injure the play, the manager with great keenness replied, 'Psha, my dear Doctor, do not be fear∣ful of <HI>squibs,</HI> when we have been sitting almost these two hours upon a <HI>barrel of gunpowder!</HI>' The piece, however, contrary to Mr. <HI>Colman'</HI>s expectation, was received with uncommon ap∣plause by the audience; and <HI>Goldsmith'</HI>s pride was so hurt by the severity of the above obser∣vation,
<PB N="xiii" REF="032200_0007_0FF1835A8F8E3550"/>
that it entirely put an end to his friend∣ship for the gentleman who made it.</P>
<P>"Notwithstanding the great success of his pieces, by some of which, it is asserted, upon good authority, he cleared 1800l. in one year, his circumstances were by no means in a pros∣perous situation! partly owing to the liberality of his disposition, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had contracted of gaming, the arts of which he knew very little of, and consequently became the prey of those who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his ignorance.</P>
<P>"Just before his death, he had formed a de∣sign for executing an <HI>Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,</HI> the prospectus of which he actually printed, and distributed among his ac∣quaintance. In this work, several of his literary friends (particularly Sir <HI>Joshua Reynolds,</HI> Dr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Beauclerc,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>) had engaged to furnish him with articles upon differ∣ent subjects. He had entertained the most san∣guine expectations from the success of it. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that encouragement from the booksellers which he had imagined it would undoubtedly receive; and he used to lament this circumstance almost to the last hour of his existence.</P>
<P>"He had been for some years afflicted, at different times, with a violent strangury, which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part
<PB N="xiv" REF="032200_0008_0FF1835DE60E1C78"/>
of his life; and which, united with the vexa∣tions he suffered upon other occasions, brought on a kind of habitual despondency. In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever, which, being improperly treated, termi∣nated in his dissolution on the 4th day of <HI>April,</HI> 1774, in the forty-third year of his age. His friends, who were very numerous and respecta∣ble, had determined to bury him in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> where a tablet was to have been erected to his memory. His pall was to have been sup∣ported by Lord <HI>Shelburne,</HI> Lord <HI>Louth,</HI> Sir <HI>Joshua Reynolds,</HI> the Hon. Mr. <HI>Beauclerc,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edmund Burke,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garrick;</HI> but, from some unaccountable circumstances, this design was dropped, and his remains were privately deposit∣ed in the <HI>Temple</HI> burial-ground.</P>
<P>"As to his character, it is strongly illustrated by Mr. <HI>Pope'</HI>s line;
<Q><L>'In wit a man, simplicity a child.'</L></Q></P>
<P>"The learned leisure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by distresses which arose from the openness of his temper, and which sometimes threw him into loud fits of passion; but this impetuosity was corrected upon a mo∣ment's reflection; and his servants have been known, upon these occasions, purposely to throw themselves in his way, that they might profit by it immediately after; for he who had the good
<PB N="xv" REF="032200_0008_0FF1835DE60E1C78"/>
fortune to be reproved, was certain of being re∣warded for it. His disappointments at other times made him peevish and sullen, and he has often left a party of convivial friends abruptly in the evening, in order to go home and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood over his misfortunes: a circumstance which con∣tributed not a little to the increase of his malady.</P>
<P>"The universal esteem in which his poems are held, and the repeated pleasure they give in the perusal, is a striking test of their merit. He was a studious and correct observer of nature, hap∣py in the selection of his images, in the choice of his subjects, and in the harmony of his versifica∣tion; and, though his embarrassed situation pre∣vented him from putting the last hand to many of his productions, his <HI>Hermit,</HI> his <HI>Traveller,</HI> and his <HI>Deserted Village,</HI> bid fair to claim a place among the most finished pieces in the <HI>English</HI> language.</P>
<P>"The writer of these anecdotes cannot con∣clude without declaring, that, as different ac∣counts have been given of this ingenious man, these are all founded upon facts, and collected by one who lived with him upon the most friendly footing for a great number of years, and who nev∣er felt any sorrow more sensibly than that which was occasioned by his death."</P>
<P>Let it be turned to what theme it will, the opinion of an elevated literary character will succeed best with the million. Let us hear what
<PB N="xvi" REF="032200_0009_0FF183621F3E98A0"/>
Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI> says of our author, in his Life of <HI>Parnell.</HI></P>
<P>"THE Life of Dr. <HI>Parnell</HI> is a task which I should very willingly decline, since it has been lately written by <HI>Goldsmith,</HI> a man of such variety of powers, and such felicity of performance, that he always seemed to do best that which he was doing; a man who had the art of being minute without tediousness, and general without confu∣sion; whose language was copious without exu∣bernace, exact without constraint, and easy with∣out weakness.</P>
<P>"What such an author has told, who would tell again? I have made an abstract from his larger nar∣rative; and shall have this gratification from my attempt, that it gives me an opportunity of paying due tribute to the memory of a departed genius."</P>
<P>The most interesting part of the account which Mr. <HI>Davies</HI> has given of our author, in his Life of <HI>Garrick,</HI> deserves the reader's attention. The latter part of it exhibits to mankind, feelings of the first quality in nature.</P>
<P>"EVERY thing of <HI>Goldsmith</HI> seems to bear the magical touch of an enchanter; no man took less pains, and yet produced so powerful an effect; the great beauty of his composition consists in a clear, copious, and expressive style.</P>
<P>"<HI>Goldsmith</HI> was so sincere a man, that he could not conceal what was uppermost in his mind: so far from desiring to appear in the eye of the
<PB N="xvii" REF="032200_0009_0FF183621F3E98A0"/>
world to the best advantage, he took more pains to be esteemed worse than he was, than others do to appear better than they are.</P>
<P>"His disposition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mind was tender and com∣passionate; no unhappy person ever sued to him for relief, without obtaining it, if he had any thing to give; and, rather than not relieve the distressed, he would borrow. The poor woman, with whom he had lodged, during his obscuri∣ty, several years in <HI>Green-Arbour Court,</HI> by his death lost an excellent friend; for the Doctor often supplied her with food from his table, and visited her frequently with the sole purpose to be kind to her. He had his dislike, as most men have, to particular people, but unmixed with rancour. He, least of all mankind, ap∣proved <HI>Baretti'</HI>s conversation; he considered him as an insolent, over-bearing foreigner; as <HI>Baretti,</HI> in his turn, thought him an unpolished man, and an absurd companion: but, when this unhappy <HI>Italian</HI> was charged with murder, and afterwards sent by Sir <HI>John Fielding</HI> to <HI>New∣gate, Goldsmith</HI> opened his purse, and would have given him every shilling it contained; he, at the same time, insisted upon going in the coach with him to the place of his confinement."</P>
<P>A handsome Monument was erected to his Memory, some time since, in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> in the Poets' Corner, between <HI>Gay'</HI>s and the Duke of <HI>Argyle'</HI>s.</P>

<HEAD>THE BEAUTIES OF GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>STORY OF MISS SYLVIA S—.</HEAD>
<P>MISS SYLVIA S—was descended from one of the best families in the kingdom, and was left a large fortune upon her sister's decease. She had early in life been in∣troduced into company, and contracted a passion for elegance and expence. It is usual to make the heroine of a story very witty, and very beau∣tiful; and such circumstances are so surely expected, that they are scarce attended to. But whatever the finest poet could conceive of wit, or the most celebrated painter imagine of beauty, were excelled in the perfections of this young lady. Her superiority in both was allowed by all, who either heard, or had seen her. She was naturally gay, generous to a fault, good-na∣tured to the highest degree, affable in conversation;
<PB N="2" REF="032200_0014_0FF1836FADE413D0"/>
and some of her letters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other writings, as well in verse as prose, would have shone amongst those of the most celebrated wits of this, or any other age, had they been published.</P>
<P>But these great qualifications were marked by another, which lessened the value of them all. She was imprudent! But let it not be imagined, that her reputation or honor suffered by her im∣prudence; I only mean, she had no knowledge of the use of money; she relieved distress, by putting herself into the circumstances of the ob∣ject whose wants she supplied.</P>
<P>She was arrived at the age of nineteen, when the croud of her lovers, and the continual repeti∣tion of new flattery, had taught her to think she could never be forsaken, and never poor. Young ladies are apt to expect a certainty of success, from a number of lovers; and yet I have seldom seen a girl courted by an hundred lovers, that found an husband in any. Before the choice is fixed, she has either lost her reputation, or her good sense; and the loss of either is sufficient to consign her to perpetual virginity.</P>
<P>Among the number of this young lady's lovers, was the celebrated <HI>S</HI>—, who, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time, went by the name of <HI>the good-natured man.</HI> This gen∣tleman, with talents that might have done honor to humanity, suffered himself to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll at length into the lowest state of debasement. He followed the dictates of every newest pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion; his love, his
<PB N="3" REF="032200_0014_0FF1836FADE413D0"/>
pity, his generosity, and even his friendships, were all in excess: he was unable to make head against any of his sensations or desires; but they were in general worthy wishes and desires; for he was constitutionally virtuous. This gentleman, who at last died in a gaol, was, at that time, this lady's envied favourite.</P>
<P>It is probable that he, thoughtless creature! had no other prospect from this amour, but that of passing the present moments agreeably. He only courted dissipation; but the lady's thoughts were fixed on happiness. At length, however, his debts amounting to a considerable sum, he was arrested, and thrown into prison. He en∣deavoured at first to conceal his situation from his beautiful mistress; but she soon came to a knowledge of his distress, and took a fatal reso∣lution of freeing him from confinement by dis∣charging all the demands of his creditors.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nash</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Then Master of the Ceremonies at Bath.</HI></NOTE> was at that time in <HI>London,</HI> and re∣presented to the thoughtless young lady, that such a measure would effectually ruin both; that so warm a concern for the interests of Mr <HI>S</HI>—, would, in the first place, quite impair her fortune in the eyes of our sex, and, what was worse, lessen her reputation in those of her own. He added, that thus bringing Mr. <HI>S</HI>—from prison, would be only a temporary relief; that a mind so
<PB N="4" REF="032200_0015_0FF18373D3D01CF0"/>
generous as his, would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude; and, instead of improving in friendship or affection, he would only study to avoid a creditor he could never repay: that, though small favours produce good-will, great ones destroy friendship. These admonitions, however, were disregarded; and she too late found the prudence and truth of her adviser. In short, her fortune was by this means exhausted; and, with all her attractians, she found her ac∣quaintance began to disesteem her, in proportion as she became poor.</P>
<P>In this situation she accepted Mr. <HI>Nash'</HI>s invi∣tation of returning to <HI>Bath.</HI> He promised to introduce her to the best company there; and he was assured that her merit would do the rest. Upon her very first appearance, ladies of the highest distinction courted her friendship and esteem; but a settled melancholy had taken possession of her mind, and no amusements that they could propose were sufficient to divert it. Yet still, as if from habit, she followed the crowd in its levities, and frequented those places where all persons endea∣vour to forget themselves in the bustle of cere∣mony and show.</P>
<P>Her beauty, her simplicity, and her unguarded situation, soon drew the attention of a designing wretch, who at that time kept one of the Rooms at <HI>Bath,</HI> and who thought that this lady's merit, properly managed, might turn to good account.
<PB N="5" REF="032200_0015_0FF18373D3D01CF0"/>
This woman's name was Dame <HI>Lindsey,</HI> a creature, who, though vicious, was in appearance sanctified; and, though designing, had some wit and humour. She began, by the humblest assiduity, to ingratiate herself with Miss <HI>S</HI>—; shewed that she could be amusing as a companion, and, by frequent offers of money, proved that she could be useful as a friend. Thus, by degrees, she gained an entire ascendant over this poor, thoughtless, deserted girl; and, in less than one year, namely, about 1727, Miss <HI>S</HI>—, without ever transgressing the laws of virtue, had entirely lost her reputation. Whenever a person was wanting to make up a party for play at Dame <HI>Lindsey's, Sylvia,</HI> as she was then familiarly called, was sent for, and was obliged to suffer all those slights, which the rich but too often let fall upon their in feriors in point of fortune.</P>
<P>In most, even the greatest minds, the heart at last becomes level with the meanness of its con∣dition; but in this charming girl it struggled hard with adversity, and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with sullen reluctance.</P>
<P>But though in the course of three years she was in the very eye of public inspection, yet Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> the architect, avers, that he could never, by the strictest observations, perceive her to be tainted with any other vice, than that of suffering herself to be decoyed to the gaming-table, and, at her own hazard, playing for the amusement and ad∣vantage
<PB N="6" REF="032200_0016_0FF18376A82E7408"/>
of others. Her friend, Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> there∣fore, thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with Dame <HI>Lindsey,</HI> and to rent part of Mr. <HI>Wood's</HI> house, in <HI>Queen-square,</HI> where she behaved with the utmost complaisance, regularity, and virtue.</P>
<P>In this situation, her detestation of life still continued; she found, that time would infallibly deprive her of part of her attractions, and that continual solicitude would impair the rest. With these reflections she would frequently entertain herself, and an old faithful maid, in the vales of <HI>Bath,</HI> whenever the weather would permit them to walk out. She would even sometimes start questions in company, with seeming unconcern, in order to know what act of suicide was easiest, and which was attended with the smallest pain. When tired with exercise, she generally retired to meditation; and she became habituated to early hours of sleep and rest. But when the weather prevented her usual exercise, and her sleep was thus more difficult, she made it a rule to rise from her bed, and walk about her chamber, till she began to find an inclination for repose.</P>
<P>This custom made it necessary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room: and the maid usually, when she withdrew, locked the chamber door; and, pushing the key under it beyond reach; her mistress, by that constant me∣thod, lay undisturbed until seven o'clock in the
<PB N="7" REF="032200_0016_0FF18376A82E7408"/>
morning; then she arose, unlocked the door, and rang the bell, as a signal for the maid to return.</P>
<P>This state of seeming piety, regularity, and prudence continued for some time, till the gay, celebrated, toasted Miss <HI>Sylvia</HI> was sunk into an housekeeper to the gentleman at whose house she lived. She was unable to keep company, for want of the elegancies of dress, that are the usual pass∣port among the polite; and she was too haughty to seem to want them. The fashionable, the amusing, and the polite, in society, now seldom visited her; and, from being once the object of every eye, she was now deserted by all, and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own impru∣dence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> and part of of his family, were gone to <HI>London.</HI> Miss <HI>Sylvia</HI> was left with the rest, as a governess, at <HI>Bath.</HI> She sometimes saw Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> and acknowledged the friendship of his admonitions, though she refused to accept any other marks of his generosity than that of advice. Upon the close of the day in which Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> was expected to return from <HI>London,</HI> she expressed some uneasiness at the disappointment of not seeing him; took particular care to settle the affairs of his family; and then, as usual, sat down to meditation. She now cast a retrospect over her past misconduct, and her approaching misery; she saw, that even affluence gave her no real happi∣ness, and from indigence she thought nothing could
<PB N="8" REF="032200_0017_0FF18378410A9230"/>
be hoped but lingering calamity. She at length conceived the fatal resolution of leaving a life, in which she could see no corner for comfort, and terminating a scene of imprudence in suicide.</P>
<P>Thus resolved, she sat down at her dining∣room window, and with cool intrepidity wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window:
<Q><L>O Death! thou pleasing end of human woe!</L>
<L>Thou cure for life! Thou greatest good below!</L>
<L>Still may'st thou fly the coward, and the slave,</L>
<L>And thy soft slumbers only bless the brave.</L></Q></P>
<P>She then went into company with the most cheerful serenity; talked of indifferet subjects till supper, which she ordered to be got ready in a little library belonging to the family. There she spent the remaining hours, preceding bed-time, in dandling two of Mr. <HI>Wood's</HI> children on her knees. In retiring from thence to her chamber, she went into the nursery, to take her leave of another child, as it lay sleeping in the cradle. Struck with the innocence of the little babe's looks, and the consciousness of her meditated guilt, she could not avoid bursting into tears, and hug∣ging it in her arms; she then bid her old ser∣vant a good night, for the first time she had ever done so, and went to bed as usual.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032200_0017_0FF18378410A9230"/>
It is probable she soon quitted her bed, and was seized with an alternation of passions, be∣fore she yielded to the impulse of despair. She dressed herself in clean linen, and white garments of every kind, like a bride-maid. Her gown was pinned over her breast, just as a nurse pins the swaddling cloaths of an infant. A pink silk girdle was the instrument with which she resolv∣ed to terminate her misery, and this was length∣ened by another made of gold thread. The end of the former was tied with a noose, and the latter with three knots, at a small distance from one another.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, she sat down again, and read; for she left the book open at that place, in the story of <HI>Olympia,</HI> in the <HI>Orlando Furios<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>Ari∣osto,</HI> where, by the perfidy and ingratitude of her bosom friend, she was ruined, and left to the mercy of an unpitying world. This tragical event gave her fresh spirits to go through her fatal purpose; so standing upon a stool, and fling∣ing the girdle, which was tied round her neck, over a closet-door that opened into her chamber, she remained suspended. Her weight however broke the girdle, and the poor despairer fell upon the floor with such violence, that her fall awak∣ened a workman that lay in the house, about half an hour after two o'clock.</P>
<P>Recovering herself, she began to walk about the room, as her usual custom was when she
<PB N="10" REF="032200_0018_0FF1837C5CE527E0"/>
wanted sleep; and the workman imagining it to be only some ordinary accident, again went to sleep. She once more, therefore, had recourse to a stronger girdle made of silver thread; and this kept her suspended till she died.</P>
<P>Her old maid continued in the morning to wait as usual for the ringing of the bell, and pro∣tracted her patience hour after hour, till two o'clock in the afternoon; when the workmen at length entering the room through the window, found their unfortunate mistress still hanging, and quite cold. The coroner's j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry being im∣panelled, brought in their verdict, Lunacy; and her corpse was next night decently buried in her father's grave, at the charge of a female compani∣on, with whom she had for many years an insepar∣able intimacy.</P>
<P>Thus ended a female wit, a toast, and a game∣ster; loved, admired, and forsaken; formed for the delight of society, fallen by imprudence into an object of pity. Hundreds in high life lamented her fate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d wished, when too late, to redress her injuries. They who once had helped to im∣pair her fortune, now regretted that they assisted in so mean a pursuit. The little effects she had left behind were bought up with the greatest avidity, by those who desired to preserve some token of a companion that once had given them such delight. The remembrance of every virtue she was possessed of was now improv∣ed
<PB N="11" REF="032200_0018_0FF1837C5CE527E0"/>
by pity. Her former follies were few, but the last swelled them to a large amount. As she remains the strongest instance to posterity, that want of prudence alone, almost cancels e∣very other virtue.</P>

<HEAD>CALAMITIES.</HEAD>
<P>MAN little knows what calamities are be∣yond his patience to bear till he tries them. As in ascending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every step we rise shews us some new and gloomy prospect of hidden dis∣appointment; so in our descent from the sum∣mits of pleasure, though the vale of misery below may appear at first dark and gloomy, yet the busy mind, still attentive to its own amusement, finds, as we descend, something to flatter and to please. Sill as we approach, the darkest objects appear to brighten, and the mental eye becomes adapt∣ed to its gloomy situation.</P>

<HEAD>OPINION OF THE ENGLISH.</HEAD>
<P>THE English in general seem fonder of gain∣ing the esteem than the love of those they con∣verse with: this gives a formality to their amuse∣ments; their gayest conversations have something too wise for innocent relaxation; though in com∣pany you are seldom disgusted with the absurdity of a fool, you are seldom lifted into rapture by
<PB N="14" REF="032200_0020_0FF1837FADCCDA80"/>
those strokes of vivacity which give instant, though not permanent pleasure.</P>
<P>What they want, however, in gaiety, they make up in politeness. You smile at hearing me praise the English for their politeness: you who have heard very different accounts from the mis∣sionaries at Pekin, who have seen such a different behaviour in their merchants and seamen at home. But I must still repeat it, the English seem more polite than any of their neighbours: their great art in this respect lies in endeavouring, while they oblige, to lessen the force of the favour. Other countries are fond of obliging a stranger; but seem desirous that he should be sensible of the obligation. The English confer their kindness with an appearance of indifference, and give away benefits with an air as if they despised them.</P>

<P>EVERY favour a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> receives, in some mea∣sure sinks him below his dignity; and in propor∣tion to the value of the benefit, or the frequency of its acceptance, he gives up so much of his na∣tural independence. He therefore, who thrives upon the unmerited bounty of another, if he has any sensibility, suffers the worst of servitude: the shackled slave may murmur without reproach, but the humble dependant is taxed with ingratitude upon every symptom of discontent; the one may rave round the walls of his cell, but the other lingers in all the silence of mental confinement. To increase his distress, every new obligation but adds to the former load which kept the vigorous mind from rising; till at last, elastic no longer, it shapes itself to constraint, and puts on habitual servility.</P>

<P>IN general, the benefactions of a generous man are but ill bestowed. His heart seldom gives him leave to examine the real distress of the object which sues for pity; his good-nature takes the alarm too soon, and he bestows his fortune only on apparent wretchedness. The man natu∣rally frugal, on the other hand, seldom relieves; but when he does, his reason, and not his sensa∣tions, generally find out the object. Every in∣stance of his bounty is therefore permanent, and bears witness to his benevolence.</P>

<HEAD>VASSALAGE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is perhaps one of the severest misfortunes of the great, that they are, in general, obliged to live among men whose real value is lessened by dependance, and whose minds are enslaved by obligation. The humble companion may have at first accepted patronage with generous views; but soon he feels the mortifying influence of conscious inferiority, by degrees sinks into a flatterer, and from flattery at last degenerates into stupid vene∣ration. To remedy this, the great often dismiss

<HEAD>DRESS.</HEAD>
<P>ALL things rare and brilliant will ever con∣tinue to be fashionable, while men derive greater advantage from opulence than virtue; while the means of appearing considerable are more easily acquired than the title to be considered. The first impression we generally make, arises from our dress; and this varies in conformity to our in∣clinations, and the manner in which we desire to be considered. The modest man, or he who would wish to be thought so, desires to shew the simplicity of his mind by the plainness of his dress: the vain man, on the contrary, takes a pleasure in displaying his superiority, "and is willing to incur the spectator's dislike, so he does but excite his attention."</P>

<HEAD>JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>OF all virtues Justice is the most difficult to be practised by a king who has a power to par∣don. All men, even tyrants themselves, lean to mercy when unbiassed by passions or interest. The heart naturally persuades to forgiveness; and pursuing the dictates of this pleasing deceiv∣er,
<PB N="27" REF="032200_0026_0FF183938384ECB8"/>
we are led to prefer our private satisfaction to public utility. What a thorough love for the pub∣lic, what a strong command over the passions, what a finely conducted judgment must he pos∣sess, who opposes the dictates of reason to those of his heart, and prefers the future interest of his people to his own immediate satisfaction!</P>
<P>If still to a man's own natural biass for tender∣ness, we add the numerous solicitations made by a criminal's friends for mercy; if we survey a king not only opposing his own feelings, but re∣fusing those he regards, and this to satisfy the public, whose cries he may never hear, whose gratitude he may never receive; this surely is true greatness! Let us fancy ourselves for a mo∣ment in this just old man's place, surrounded by numbers, all soliciting the same favour, a favour that nature disposes us to grant, where the in∣ducements to pity are laid before us in the strong∣est light, suppliants at our feet, some ready to resent a refusal, none opposing a compliance; let us, I say, suppose ourselves in such a situation, and I fancy we should find ourselves more apt to act the character of good-natured men than of up∣right magistrates.</P>
<P>What contributes to raise justice above all o∣ther kingly virtues, is, that it is attended seldom with a due share of applause, and those who prac∣tise it must be influenced by greater motives than empty fame. The people are generally well
<PB N="28" REF="032200_0027_0FF18396D2C246D0"/>
pleased with a remission of punishment, and all that wears the appearance of humanity; it is the wise alone who are capable of discerning that im∣partial justice is the truest mercy: they know it to be difficult, very difficult, at once to compas∣sionate, and yet condemn an object that pleads for tenderness.</P>

<HEAD>YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been often said, that the season of youth is the season of pleasures; but this can only be true in savage countries, where but little prepara∣tion is made for the perfection of human nature, and where the mind has but a very small part in the enjoyment. It is otherwise in those places where nature is carried to the highest pitch of re∣finement, in which this season of the greatest sen∣sual delight is wisely made subservient to the suc∣ceeding, and more rational one of manhood. Youth, with us, is but a scene of preparation; a drama, upon the right conduct of which all fu∣ture happiness is to depend. The youth who follows his appetites, too soon seizes the cup, be∣fore

<HEAD>THE SOUL.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the soul is at rest, all the features of the visage seem settled in a state of profound tran∣quillity. Their proportion, their union, and their harmony, seem to mark the sweet serenity of the mind, and give a true information of what passes within. But when the soul is excited, the hu∣man visage becomes a living picture; where the passions are expressed with as much delicacy as energy, where every motion is designed by some correspondent feature, where every impression an∣ticipates the will, and betrays those hidden agita∣tions that he would often wish to conceal.</P>
<P>It is particularly in the eyes that the passions are painted; and in which we may most readily dis∣cover their beginning. The eye seems to belong to the soul more than any other organ; it seems to participate of all its emotions, as well the most soft and tender, as the most tumultuous and force∣ful. It not only receives, but transmits them by symphathy; the observing eye of one catches the

<P>WE now are all agreed, that unlimited pow∣er arrogated on one side, and the tumultuous freedom introduced on the other, are both into∣lerable; yet, of the two, perhaps, despotism is superior. In a republic, the number of tyrants are uncontrolable; for they can support each other in oppression: in a monarchy, there is one object, who, if he offends, is easily punish∣able, because he is but one. The oppressions of a monarch are generally exerted only in the nar∣row sphere round him; the oppressions of the governors of a republic, though not so flagrant, are more universal: the monarch is apt to commit great enormities, but they seldom reach the mul∣titude at humble distance from the throne; the republican despot oppresses the multitude that lies within the circle of his influence, for he knows them: the monarch terrifies me with great evils, which I may never feel; the despot actually loads me with submissions, which I am constantly obliged to sustain; and, in my opinion, it is much better to be in danger of having my head chopped off with an axe, once in my life, than to have my leg galled with a continual fetter.</P>

<HEAD>UTILITY OF NEW BOOKS.</HEAD>
<P>IN proportion as society refines, new books must ever become more necessary. Savage rusti∣city is reclaimed by oral admonition alone: but the elegant excesses of refinement are best corrected by the still voice of studious enquiry. In a polite age, almost every person becomes a reader, and receives more instruction from the press than the pulpit. The preaching Bonse may instruct the illiterate peasant; but nothing less than the insinu∣ating address of a fine writer can win its way to an heart already relaxed in all the effeminacy of re∣finement. Books are necessary to correct the vices of the polite; but those vices are ever changing, and the antidote should be changed accordingly,—should still be new.</P>
<P>Instead, therefore, of thinking the number of new publications too great, I could wish it still greater, as they are the most useful instruments of reformation. Every country must be instructed either by <HI>writers</HI> or <HI>preachers;</HI> but as the number of readers increases, the number of hearers is proportionably diminished,—the writer becomes more useful, and the preaching Bonse less neces∣sary.</P>

Its billows, and its monsters, instead of presenting a scene of terror, only call up the courage of this little intrepid being; and the greatest danger that man now fears on the deep, is from his fellow-creatures. Indeed, when I consider the human race as Nature has formed them, there is but very little of the habitable globe that seems made for them. But when I consider them as accu∣mulating the experience of ages, in commanding the earth, there is nothing so great, or so terrible.

<HEAD>OPINION OF WOMEN; WITH AN ACCOUNT OF CATHARINA ALEXOWNA, EMPRESS OF RUSSIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE modest virgin, the prudent wife, or the careful matron, are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers, blustering he∣roines, or virago queens. She who makes her husband and her children happy, who reclaims the one from vice, and trains up the other to virtue, is a much greater character than ladies described in romance, whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their qui∣ver or their eyes.</P>
<P>Women, it has been observed, are not natu∣rally formed for great cares themselves, but to soften ours. Their tenderness is the proper re∣ward for the dangers we undergo for their pre∣servation; and the ease and cheerfulness of their conversation, our desirable retreat from the fa∣tigues of intense application. They are confined within the narrow limits of domestic assiduity; and when they stray beyond them, they move beyond their sphere, consequently without grace.</P>
<P>Fame, therefore, has been very unjustly dis∣pensed, among the female sex. Those who least deserved to be remembered, meet our admiration
<PB N="55" REF="032200_0040_0FF183BB7058D4C0"/>
and applause; while many, who have been, an honor to humanity, are passed over in silence. Perhaps no age has produced a stronger instance of misplaced fame than the present; the <HI>Semira∣mis</HI> and the <HI>Thalestris</HI> of antiquity are talked of, while a modern character, infinitely greater than either, is unnoticed and unknown.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This account seems taken from the manuscript memoirs of H. SPELMAN,</HI> <ABBR><HI>Esq.</HI></ABBR></NOTE> <HI>Catharina Alexowna,</HI> born near <HI>Derpat,</HI> a little city of <HI>Livonia,</HI> was heir to no other inhe∣ritance than the virtues and frugality of her pa∣rents. Her father being dead, she lived with her aged mother, in their cottage covered with straw; and both, though very poor, were very contented. Here, retired from the gaze of the world, by the labour of her hands she supported her parent, who was now incapable of supporting herself. While <HI>Catharina</HI> spun, the old woman would sit by, and read some book of devotion; thus, when the fatigues of the day were over, both would sit down contentedly by the fire-side, and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant festivity.</P>
<P>Though her face and person were models of perfection, yet her whole attention seemed be∣stowed upon her mind; her mother taught her to read, and an old <HI>Lutheran</HI> minister instructed her in the maxims and duties of religion. Na∣ture had furnished her not only with a ready,
<PB N="56" REF="032200_0041_0FF183F5CEEE47E8"/>
but a solid torn of thought, not only with a strong but a right understanding. Such truly female accomplishments procured her several so∣licitations of marriage from the peasants of the country; but their offers were refused: for she loved her mother too tenderly to think of a se∣paration.</P>
<P><HI>Catharina</HI> was fifteen when her mother died: she now, therefore, left her cottage, and went to live with the <HI>Lutheran</HI> minister, by whom she had been instructed from her childhood. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his house she resided, in quality of governess to his children; at once reconciling in her cha∣racter unerring prudence with surprising vivacity.</P>
<P>The old man, who regarded her as one of his own children, had her instructed in dancing and music, by the masters who attended the rest of his family. Thus she continued to improve till he died; by which accident she was once more reduced to poverty. The country of <HI>La∣vonia</HI> was at this time wasted by war, and lay in a most miserable state of desolation. Those ca∣lamities are ever most heavy upon the poor; wherefore <HI>Catharina,</HI> though possessed of so ma∣ny accomplishments, experienced all the mise∣ries of hopeless indigence. Provisions becom∣ing every day more scarce, and her private stock being entirely exhausted, she at last resolved to travel to <HI>Marienburgh,</HI> a city of greater plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="032200_0041_0FF183F5CEEE47E8"/>
With her scanty wardrobe, packed up in a wal∣let, she set out on her journey, on foot. She was to walk through a region miserable by nature, but rendered still more hideous by the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Russians,</HI> who, as each happened to become masters, plundered it at discretion; but hunges had taught her to despise the dangers and fa∣tigues of the way.</P>
<P>One evening, upon her journey, as she had entered a cottage by the way-side, to take up her lodging for the night, she was insulted by two <HI>Swedish</HI> soldiers, who insisted upon qualifying her, as they termed it, <HI>to follow the camp.</HI> They might, probably, have carried their insults into violence, had not a subaltern officer, accidental∣ly passing by, come in to her assistance. Upon his appearing, the soldiers immediately desisted; but her thankfulness was hardly greater than her surprise, when she instantly recollected, in her deliverer, the son of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> minister, her former instructor, benefactor and friend.</P>
<P>This was an happy interview for <HI>Catharina.</HI> The little stock of money she had brought from home was by this time quite exhausted; her cloaths were gone, piece by piece, in order to satisfy those who had entertained her in their houses: her gene∣rous countryman, therefore, parted with what he could spare, to buy her clothes, furnished her with an horse, and gave her letters of recommendation to Mr. <HI>Gluck,</HI> a faithful friend of his father's, and superintendant of <HI>Marienburgh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="032200_0042_0FF183BF9713DA28"/>
Our beautiful stranger had only to appear, to be well received: she was immediately admitted into the superintendant's family, as governess to his two daughters; and though yet but seventeen, shewed herself capable of instructing her sex, not only in virtue, but politeness. Such was her good sense and beauty, that her master himself in a short time offered her his hand, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his great surprise she thought proper to refuse. Actuated by a principle of gratitude, she was resolved to marry her deliver only, even though he had lost an arm, and was otherwise disfi∣gured by wounds, in the service.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to prevent further solici∣tations from others, as soon as the officer came to town upon duty, she offered him her person, which he accepted with transport; and their nup∣tials were solemnized as usual. But all the lines of her fortune were to be striking: the very day on which they were married, the <HI>Russians</HI> laid siege to <HI>Marienburgh.</HI> The unhappy soldier had now no time to enjoy the well-carned pleasures of matrimony; he was called off, before consum∣mation, to an attack, from which he was never after seen to return.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the siege went on with fury, aggravated on one side by obstinacy, on the other by revenge. This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous; the in∣nocent peasant and the harmless virgin often shared

At length, when the carnage was pretty well over, <HI>Catharina</HI> was found hid in an oven.</P>
<P>She had been hitherto poor, but still was free; she was now to conform to her hard fate, and learn what it was to be a slave: in this situation, however, she behaved with piety and humility; and, though misfortunes had abated her vivacity, yet she was chearful. The fame of her merit and resignation reached even Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> the <HI>Russian</HI> General: he desired to see her, was struck with her beauty, bought her from the sol∣dier, her master, and placed her under the di∣rection of his own sister. Here she was treated with all the respect which her merit deserved, while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune.</P>
<P>She had not been long in this situation, when <HI>Peter the Great</HI> paying the Prince a visit, <HI>Catha∣rina</HI> happened to come in with some dry fruits, which she served round with peculiar modesty. The mighty monarch saw, and was struck with her beauty. He returned the next day, called for the beautiful slave, asked her several questions, and found her understanding even more perfect than her person.</P>

He im∣mediately enquired the history of the fair <HI>Livonian,</HI> who was not yet eighteen. He traced her through the vale of obscurity, through all the vi∣cissitudes of her fortune, and found her truly great in them all. The meanness of her birth was no obstruction to his design; their nuptials were solemnised in private; the Prince assuring his courtiers, that virtue alone was the properest ladder to a throne.</P>

<HEAD>THE MAN OF THE WORLD. A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IF you are fond of hearing <HI>hair-breadth' sapes,</HI> my history must certainly please; for I have been for twenty years upon the very verge of starving, without ever being starved.</P>
<P>My father, the younger son of a good family, was possessed of a small living in the church. His education was above his fortune, and his gene∣rosity greater than his education. Poor as he was, he had his flatterers still poorer than himself; for every dinner he gave them, they returned him an equivalent in praise; and this was all he wanted. The same ambition that actuates a mo∣narch at the head of an army, influenced my fa∣ther at the head of his table: he told the story of the ivy-tree, and that was laughed at; he re∣peated the jest of the two scholars and one pair of breeches, and the company laughed at that; but the story of Taffy in the sedan chair were sure to set the table in a roar. Thus his pleasure increased, in proportion to the pleasure he gave; he loved all the world, and he fancied all the world loved him.</P>
<P>As his fortune was but small, he lived up to the very extent of it; he had no intentions of
<PB N="66" REF="032200_0046_0FF183CD0946FC18"/>
leaving his children money, for that was dross he was resolved they should have learning, for learning, he used to observe, was better than silver or gold. For this purpose he undertook to instruct us himself; and took as much pains to form our morals, as to improve our understand∣ing. We were told that universal benevolence was what first cemented society: we were taught to consider all the wants of mankind as our own; to regard the <HI>human face divine</HI> with affection and esteem: he wound us up to be mere machines of pity, and rendered us incapable of withstanding the lightest impulse made either by real or ficti∣tious distress; in a word, we were perfectly in∣structed in the art of <HI>giving away</HI> thousands, be∣fore we were taught the more necessary qualifica∣tions of <HI>getting</HI> a farthing.</P>
<P>I cannot avoid imagining, that, thus refined by his lessons out of all my suspicion, and di∣vested of even all the little cunning which na∣ture had given me, I resembled, upon my first entrance into the busy and insidious world, one of those gladiators who were exposed without armour in the amphitheatre at Rome. My fa∣ther, however, who had only seen the world on one side, seemed to triumph in my superior dis∣cernment; though my whole stock of wisdom consisted in being able to talk like himself upon subjects that once were useful, because they were then topics of the busy world, but that now were
<PB N="67" REF="032200_0046_0FF183CD0946FC18"/>
utterly useless, because connected with the busy world no longer.</P>
<P>The first opportunity he had of finding his ex∣pectations disappointed, was at the very middling figure I made in the University: he had flattered himself that he should soon see me rising into the foremost rank in literary reputation, but was mor∣tified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown. His disappointment might have been partly as∣cribed to his having over-rated my talents, and partly to my dislike of mathematical reasonings at a time when my imagination and memory, yet unsatisfied, were more eager after new objects, than desirous of reasoning upon those I knew This did not, however, please my tutors, who observed, indeed, that I was a little dull; but at the same time allowed, that I seemed to be <HI>very good-natured,</HI> and had no harm in me.</P>
<P>After I had resided at college seven years, my father died, and left me—his blessing. Thus shoved from shore without ill-nature to protect, or cunning to guide, or proper stores to subsist me in so dangerous a voyage, I was obliged to embark in the wide world at twenty-two. But, in order to settle in life, my friends <HI>advised</HI> (for they always advise when they begin to despise us) they advised me, I say, to go into orders.</P>
<P>To be obliged to wear a long wig, when I liked a short one, or a black coat, when I generally dressed in brown, I thought was such a restraint
<PB N="68" REF="032200_0047_0FF183CFE2284B10"/>
upon my liberty, that I absolutely rejected the proposal. A priest in England is not the same mortified creature with a bonze in China; with us, not he that fasts best, but eats best, is reckon∣ed the best liver: yet I rejected a life of luxury, indolence, and ease, from no other consideration but that boyish one of dress; so that my friends were now perfectly satisfied I was undone; and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the least harm in him, and was so very good-natured.</P>
<P>Poverty naturally begets dependance, and I was admitted as flatterer to a great man. At first I was surprised, that the situation of a flatterer at a great man's table could be thought disagree∣able: there was no great trouble in listening at∣tentively when his lordship spoke, and laughing when he looked round for applause. This even good-manners might have obliged me to perform. I found, however, too soon, that his lordship was a greater dunce than myself; and from that very moment my power of flattery was at an end. I now rather aimed at setting him right, than at receiving his absurdities with submission. To flat∣ter those we do not know, is an easy task; but to flatter our intimate acquaintances, all whose foi∣bles are str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gly in our eye, is drudgery insup∣portable. Every time I now opened my lips in praise, my falshood went to my conscience: his lordship soon perceived me to be unfit for service; I was therefore discharged; my patron at the same time being graciously pleased to observe,
<PB N="69" REF="032200_0047_0FF183CFE2284B10"/>
that he believed I was tolerably good-natured, and had not the least harm in me.</P>
<P>Disappointed in ambition, I had recourse to love. A young lady, who lived with her aunt, and was possessed of a pretty fortune in her own disposal, had given me, as I fancied, some reasons to expect success. The symptoms by which I was guided were striking: she had always laugh∣ed with me at her aukward acquaintance, and at her aunt among the number; she always ob∣served, that a man of sense would make a better husband than a fool, and I as constantly applied the observation in my own favour. She conti∣nually talked in my company of friendship, and the beauties of the mind, and spoke of Mr. Shrimp my rival's high-heel'd shoes with detesta∣tion. These were circumstances which I thought strongly in my favour; so, after resolving, and re-resolving I had courage enough to tell her my mind. Miss heard my proposal with serenity, seeming at the same time to study the figures of her fan. Out at last it came. There was but one small objection to complete our happiness, which was no more than—that she was married three months before to Mr. Shrimp with high-heel'd shoes! By way of consolation, however, she observed, that, though I was disappointed in her, my addresses to her aunt would pro∣bably kindle her into sensibility; as the old lady always allowed me to be very good na∣tured,
<PB N="70" REF="032200_0048_0FF183D2F63B9350"/>
and not to have the least share of harm in me.</P>
<P>Yet still I had friends, numerous friends; and to them I was resolved to apply. O Friend∣ship! thou fond soother of the human breast, to thee we fly in every calamity; to thee the wretched seek for succour; on thee the care-tired son of misery fondly relies; from thy kind assis∣tance the unfortunate always hopes relief, and may be ever sure of—disappointment! My first application was to a city scrivener, who had fre∣quently offered to lend me money, when he knew I did not want it. I informed him, that now was the time to put his friendship to the test; that I wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occasion, and was resolved to take it up from him. And pray, Sir, cried my friend, do you want all this money? Indeed, I never wanted it more, returned I. I am sorry fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that, cries the scrivener, with all my heart; for they who want money when they come to borrow, will al∣ways want money when they should come to pay.</P>
<P>From him I flew with indignation to one of the best friends I had in the world, and made the same request. Indeed, Mr. Dry-bone, cries my friend, I always thought it would come to this. You know, Sir, I would not advise you but for your own good; but your conduct has hitherto been ridiculous in the highest degree, and some of your acquaintance always thought you a very silly fel∣low.
<PB N="71" REF="032200_0048_0FF183D2F63B9350"/>
Let me see—you want two hundred pounds; do you want only two hundred, Sir, exactly? To confess a truth, returned I, I shall want three hundred; but then I have another friend, from whom I can borrow the rest. Why then, repli∣ed my friend, if you would take my advice—and you know I should not presume to advise you but for your own good—I would recommend it to you to borrow the whole sum from that other friend; and then one note will serve for all, you know.</P>
<P>Poverty now began to come fast upon me; yet instead of growing more provident or cautious as I grew poor, I became every day more indolent and simple. A friend was arrested for fifty pounds; I was unable to extricate him, except by becoming his bail. When at liberty, he fled from his creditors, and left me to take his place. In prison I expected greater satisfaction than I had enjoyed at large. I hoped to converse with men in this new world, simple and believing like myself; but I found them as cunning and as cautious as those in the world I had left behind. They spunged up my money whilst it lasted; borrowed my coal, and never paid them; and che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> me when I played at cribbage. All this was done because they believed me to be very good-natured, and knew that I had no harm in me.</P>
<P>Upon my first entrance into this mansion which is to some the abode of dispair; I felt no
<PB N="72" REF="032200_0049_0FF183D70D771CF0"/>
sensations different from those I experienced a∣broad. I was now on one side the door, and those who were unconfined were on the other; this was all the difference between us. At first, indeed, I felt some uneasiness, in considering how I should be able to provide this week for the wants of the week ensuing; but after some time, if I found myself sure of eating one day, I never troubled my head how I was to be sup∣plied another. I seized every precarious meal with the utmost good-humour, indulged no rants of spleen at my situation, never called down heaven and all the stars to behold me dining upon an half-penny-worth of radishes; my very com∣panions were taught to believe, that I liked sal∣lad better than mutton. I contented myself with thinking, that all my life I should either eat white bread or brown; considered that all that happen∣ed was best, laughed when I was not in pain, took the world as it went, and read Tacitus of∣ten, for want of more books and company.</P>
<P>How long I might have continued in this tor∣pid state of simplicity, I cannot tell, had I not been roused by seeing an old acquaintance, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knew to be a prudent blockhead, prefered to a place in the government. I now found that I had pursued a wrong track, and that the true way of being able to relieve others, was to aim at independence myself. My immediate care, therefore, was to leave my present habitation,
<PB N="73" REF="032200_0049_0FF183D70D771CF0"/>
and make an entire reformation in my conduct and behaviour. For a free, open, undesigning deportment, I put on that of closeness, prudence and oeconomy. One of the most heroic actions I ever performed, and for which I shall praise myself as long as I live, was the refusing half a crown to an old acquaintance, at the time when he wanted it, and I had it to spare; for this a∣lone I deserve to be decreed an ovation.</P>
<P>I now, therefore, pursued a course of uninter∣rupted frugality, seldom wanted a dinner, and was consequently invited to twenty. I soon be∣gan to get the character of a saving hunks that had money; and insensibly grew into esteem. Neighbours have asked my advice in the disposal of their daughters, and I have always taken care not to give any. I have contracted a friendship with an alderman, only by observing, that if we take a farthing from a thousand pound, it will be a thousand pound no longer. I have been invited to a pawnbroker's table, by pretending to hate gravy; and am now actually upon treaty of mar∣riage with a rich widow, for only having observ∣ed that bread was rising. If eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m asked a question, whither I know it or not, instead of an∣swering, I only smile, and look wise. If a cha∣rity is proposed, I go about with the hat, but put nothing in myself. If a wretch solicits my pity, I observe, that the world is filled with impostors; and take a certain method of not
<PB N="74" REF="032200_0050_0FF183DA0FD7DCC8"/>
being deceived, by never relieving. In short, I now find the truest way of finding esteem, even from the indigent, is <HI>to give away nothing, and thus have much in our power to give.</HI></P>

The wheel of fortune turns incessantly round, and who can say within himself, I shall to-day be uppermost? We should hold the immutable mean that lies between in∣sensibility and anguish; our attempts should be, not to extinguish nature, but to repress it; not to stand unmoved at distress, but endeavour to turn every disafter to our own advantage.

<HEAD>EDUCATING CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE ever found it a vain task to try to make a child's learning its amusement; nor do I see what good end it would answer, were it actually attained. The child ought to have its
<PB N="81" REF="032200_0053_0FF183E2ADE72110"/>
share of play, and it will be benefited thereby; and for every reason, also, it ought to have its share of labour. The mind, by early labour, will be thus accustomed to fatigue and subordina∣tion; and whatever be the person's future employ∣ment in life, he will be better fitted to endure it, he will be thus enabled to support the drudgeries of office with content, or to fill up the vacancies of life with variety. The child, therefore, should by times be put to its duty; and we taught to know, that the task is to be done, or the punish∣ment to be endured. I do not object against al∣luring it to duty by reward; but we well know, that the mind will be more strongly stimulated by pain; and both may, upon some occasions, take their turn to operate. In this manner a child, by playing with its equals abroad, and la∣bouring with them at school, will acquire more health and knowledge than by being bred up un∣der the wing of any speculative system-maker; and will be thus qualified for a life of activity and obedience. It is true, indeed, that, when educated in this manner, the boy may not be so seemingly sensible and forward as one bred up under solitary instruction and, perhaps, this early forwardness is more engaging than useful. It is well known, that many of those children who are such prodigies of literature before ten, have not made an adequate progress to twenty. It should seem, that they only began learning
<PB N="82" REF="032200_0054_0FF183E6C5C74B38"/>
manly things before their time; and, while o∣thers were busied in picking up that knowledge adapted to their age and curiosity, these were forced upon subjects unsuited to their years; and, upon that account alone, appearing extraordinary. The stock of knowledge in both may be equal; but with this difference, that each is yet to learn what the other knows.</P>

<HEAD>LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>LOVE, when founded in the heart, will shew itself in a thousand unpremeditated sallies of fond∣ness; but every cool deliberate exhibition of the passion, only argues little understanding, or great insincerity.</P>
<P><HI>Choang</HI> was the fondest husband, and <HI>Hansi</HI> the most endearing wife, in all the kingdom of <HI>Ko∣rea;</HI> they were a pattern of conjugal bliss; the inhabitants of the country around saw, and en∣vied their felicity; wherever <HI>Choang</HI> came, <HI>Hansi</HI> was sure to follow; and in all the pleasures of <HI>Hansi, Choang</HI> was admitted a partner. They walked hand in hand wherever they appeared shewing every mark of mutual satisfaction, em∣bracing, kissing; their mouths were forever join∣ed; and, to speak in the language of anatomy, it was with them one perpetual anastomosis.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="032200_0056_0FF183EA4E2EA550"/>
Their love was so great, that it was thought nothing could interrupt their mutual peace; when an accident happened, which, in some measure, diminished the husbands assurance of his wife's fidelity; for love so refined as his, was subject to a thousand little disquietudes.</P>
<P>Happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at some distance from his house, he there perceived a lady dressed in the deepest mourning, (being cloathed all over in white) fanning the wet clay that was raised over one of the graves with a large fan, which she held in her hand. <HI>Choang,</HI> who had early been taught wisdom in the school of <HI>Lao,</HI> was unable to as∣sign a cause for her present employment; and, coming up, civilly demanded the reason, "Alas!," replied the lady, her eyes bathed in tears, "how is it possible to survive the loss of my husband, who li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s buried in this grave? He was the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men, the tenderest of husbands; with his dying breath he bid me never marry again till the earth over his grave should be dry; and here you see me steadily resolving to obey his will, and endeavouring to dry it with my fan. I have employed two whole days in fulfilling his com∣mands, and am determined not to marry till they are punctually obeyed, even though his grave should take up four days in drying."</P>
<P><HI>Choang,</HI> who was struck with the widow's beauty, could not, however, avoid smiling at
<PB N="88" REF="032200_0057_0FF183EE74D3C208"/>
her haste to be maried; but, concealing the cause of his mirth, civilly invited her home; adding, that he had a wife who might be capable of giv∣ing her some consolation. As soon as he and his guest were returned, he imparted to <HI>Hansi</HI> in private what he had seen, and could not avoid expressing his uneasiness, that such might be his own case, if his dearest wife should one day happen to survive him.</P>
<P>It is impossible to describe <HI>Hansi'</HI>s resentment at so unkind a suspicion. As her passion for him was not only great, but extremely delicate, she employed tears, anger, frowns, and exclamati∣ons, to chide his suspicions: the widow herself was inveighed against; and <HI>Hansi</HI> declared she was resolved never to sleep under the same roof with a wretch, who, like, her, could be guilty of such barefaced inconstancy. The night was cold and stormy; however, the stranger was oblig∣ed to seek another lodging, for <HI>Choang</HI> was not disposed to resist, and <HI>Hansi</HI> would have her way.</P>
<P>The widow had scarce been gone an hour, when an old disciple of <HI>Choang'</HI>s whom he had not seen for many years, come to pay him a visit. He was received with the utmost ceremony, plac∣ed in the most honourable feat at supper, and the wine began to circulate with great freedom. <HI>Cho∣ang</HI> and <HI>Hansi</HI> exhibited open marks of mutual tenderness and unfeigned reconciliation: nothing could equal their apparant happiness; so found
<PB N="89" REF="032200_0057_0FF183EE74D3C208"/>
an husband, so obedient a wife, few could behold without regreting their own infelicity; when lo! their happiness was at once disturbed by a most fatal accident. <HI>Choang</HI> fell lifeless in an apoplec∣tic fit upon the floor. Every method was used, but in vain, for his recovery. <HI>Hansi</HI> was at first inconsolable for his death: after some hours, however, she found spirits to read his last will. The ensuing day she began to moralize and talk wisdom; the next day she was able to comfort the young disciple; and, on the third, to shorten a long story, they both agreed to be married.</P>
<P>There was no longer mourning in the apart∣ments; the body of <HI>Choang</HI> was now thrust into on old coffin, and placed in one of the meanest rooms, there to lie unattended until the time pre∣scribed by law for his interment. In the mean time, <HI>Hansi,</HI> and the young disciple, were array∣ed in the most magnificent habits; the bride wore in her nose a jewel of immense price, and her lover was dressed in all the finery of his for∣mer master, together with a pair of artificial whiskers that reached down to his toes. The hour of their nuptials was arrived; the whole fa∣mily sympathised with their approaching happi∣ness; the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffused the most exquisite perfume, and a lustre more bright than noon-day. The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apart∣ment, with impatience; when his servant ap∣proaching
<PB N="90" REF="032200_0058_0FF183F1523E1310"/>
with terror in his countenance, inform∣ed her, that his master was fallen into a fit, which would certainly be mortal, unless the heart of a man lately dead, could be obtained, and applied to his breast. She scarce waited to hear the end of his story, when, tucking up her clothes, she run with a mattock in her hand to the coffin, where <HI>Choang</HI> lay, resolving to apply the heart of her dead husband as a cure for the living. She therefore struck the lid with the utmost violence. In a few blows the coffin flew open, when the body, which to all appearance had been dead, began to move, Terrified at the sight, <HI>Hansi</HI> dropped the mattock, and <HI>Choang</HI> walked out, astonished at his own situation, his wife's un∣usual magnificence, and here more amazing sur∣prise. He went among the apartments, unable to conceive the cause of so much splendour. He was not long in suspence, before his domestics informed him of every transaction since he first became insensible. He could scarce believe what they told him, and went in pursuit of <HI>Hansi</HI> her∣self, in order to receive more certain information, or to reproach her infidelity. But she prevented his reproaches: he found her weltering in blood for she had stabbed herself to the heart, being unable to survibe her shame and disappointment.</P>
<P><HI>Choang,</HI> being a philosopher, was too wise to make any loud lamentations; he thought it best to bear his loss with serenity; so mending up the
<PB N="91" REF="032200_0058_0FF183F1523E1310"/>
old coffin where he had lain himself, he placed his faithless spouse in his room; and, unwilling that so many nuptial preparations should be ex∣pended in vain, he the same night maried the widow with the large fan.</P>
<P>As they both were apprised of the foibles of each other before-hand, they knew how to ex∣cuse them after marriage. They lived together for many years in great tranquility, and not expecting rapture, made a shift to find contentment.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few subjects which have been more written upon, and less understood, than that of Friendship. To follow the dictates of some, this virtue, instead of being the assuager of pain, becomes the source of every inconvenience. Such speculatists, by expecting too much from friend∣ship, dissolve the connection, and, by drawing the bands too closely at length break them. Al∣most all our romance and novel-writers are of this kind; they persuade us to friendships, which we find impossible to sustain to the last; so that this sweetner of life, under proper regulations, is by their means, rendered inaccessible or uneasy. It is certain, the best method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it in some measure, make itself; a similitude of minds or studies, and even some∣times a diversity of pursuits, will produce all the pleasures that arise from it. The current of ten∣derness widens, as it proceeds: and two men
<PB N="97" REF="032200_0061_0FF183F764CBA998"/>
imperceptibly find their hearts warm with good∣nature for each other, when they were at first only in pursuit of mirth or relaxation.</P>
<P>Friendship is like a debt of honour; the mo∣ment it is talked of, it loses its real name, and assumes the more ungreatful form of obligation. From hence we find, that those who regularly undertake to cultivate friendship, find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours. That circle of being, which dependence gathers round us, is al∣most ever unfriendly; they secretly wish the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their connexions more nearly equal; and, where they even have the most virtue, are pre∣pared to reserve all their affections for their pa∣tron, only in the hour of his decline. Increasing the obligations which are laid upon such minds, only increases their burthen; they feel themselves unable to repay the immensity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent resent∣ment at the hand that it stretched out with offers of service and relief.</P>
<P><HI>Plautinus</HI> was a man who thought that every good was brought from riches; and as he was pos∣sessed of great wealth, and had a mind naturaly formed for virtue, he resolved to gather a circle of the best men round him. Among the number of his dependants was <HI>Musidorus,</HI> with a mind just as fond of virtue, yet not less proud than his pa∣tron. His circumstances, however, were such as forced him to stoop to the good offices of his su∣perior,
<PB N="98" REF="032200_0062_0FF183FA3A053DB0"/>
and he saw himself daily among a num∣ber of others loaded with benefits and protestati∣ons of friendship. These, in the usual course of the world, he thought it prudent to accept; but, while he gave his esteem, he could not give his heart. A want of affection breaks out in the most trifling instances, and <HI>Plautinus</HI> had skill enough to observe the minutest actions of the man he wished to make his friend. In these he ever found his aim disappointed; for <HI>Musidorus</HI> claim∣ed an exchange of hearts which <HI>Plautinus,</HI> soli∣cited by a variety of claims, could never think of bestowing.</P>
<P>It may be easily supposed, that the reserve of our poor proud man, was soon construed into ingratitude: and such, indeed, in the common acceptation of the world it was. Wherever <HI>Musidorus</HI> appeared, he was remarked as the ungrateful man; he had accepted favours, it was said, and had still the insolence to pretend to in∣dependance. The event, however, justified his conduct. <HI>Plautinus,</HI> by misplaced liberality, at length became poor; and it was then that <HI>Mu∣sidorus</HI> first thought of making a friend of him. He flew to the man of fallen fortune, with an offer of all he had; wrought under his direction with assiduity; and by uniting their talents, both were at length placed in that state of life from which one of them had formerly fallen.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="032200_0062_0FF183FA3A053DB0"/>
To this story, taken from modern life, I shall add one more, taken from a Greek writer of an∣tiquity:—'Two Jewish soldiers, in the time of <HI>Vespasian,</HI> had made many campaigns together; and a participation of dangers, at length, bred an union of hearts. They were remarked through∣out the whole army, as the two friendly brothers; they felt and fought for each other. Their friend∣ship might have continued, without interruption, till death, had not the good fortune of the one alarmed the pride of the other, which was in his promotion to be a Centurion under the fa∣mous John, who headed a particular party of the Jewish male-contents.</P>
<P>From this moment their former love was con∣verted into the most inveterate enmity. They at∣tached themselves to opposite factions, and sought each other's lives in the conflict of adverse party. In this manner they continued for more than two years, vowing mutual revenge, and animated with an unconquerable spirit of aversion. At length, however, that party of the <HI>Jews,</HI> to which the mean soldier belonged, joining with the <HI>Romans,</HI> it became victorious, and drove <HI>John,</HI> with all his adherents, into the Temple. History has given us more than one picture of the dreadful conflagration of that superb edifice.

was in this situation of things, that the now-suc∣cessful soldier saw his former friend upon the bat∣tlements of the highest tower, looking round with horror, and just ready to be consumed with flames. All his former tenderness now return∣ed; he saw the man of his bosom just going to perish; and, unable to withstand the impulse, he ran spreading his arms, and crying out to his friend, to leap down from the top, and find safety with him. The Centurion from above heard and obeyed, and, casting himself from the top of the tower, into his fellow-soldiers's arms, both fell a sacrifice on the spot; one being crush∣ed to death by the weight of his companion, and the other dashed to pieces by the greatness of his fall.'</P>

<HEAD>SABINUS AND OLINDA.</HEAD>
<P>IN a fair, rich, flourishing country, whose cliffs are washed by the German ocean, lived <HI>Sabinus,</HI> a youth formed by Nature to make a conquest wherever he thought proper; but the constancy of his disposition fixed him only with <HI>Olinda.</HI></P>
<P>He was, indeed, superior to her in fortune; but that defect on her side was so amply supplied by her merit, that none was thought more wor∣thy of his regards than she. He loved her, he was beloved by her; and, in a short time, by joining hands publicly, they avowed the union of their hearts. But, alas! none, however fortu∣nate, however happy, are exempt from the shafts of envy, and the malignant effects of ungovern∣ed appetite. How unsafe, how detestable are they who have this fury for their guide! How certainly will it lead them from themselves, and plunge them in errors they would have shudder∣ed at, even in apprehension! <HI>Ariana,</HI> a lady of many amiable qualities, very nearly allied to <HI>Sabinus,</HI> and highly esteemed by him, imagined herself slighted, and injuriously treated, since his marriage with <HI>Clinda.</HI> By incautiously suf∣fering this jealously to corrode in her breast, she began to give a loose to passion; she forgot those many virtues, for which she had been so long,
<PB N="103" REF="032200_0064_0FF184018939DCB8"/>
and so justly applauded. Causeless suspicion, and mistaken resentment, betrayed her into all the gloom of discontent: she sighed without ceas∣ing; the happiness of others give her intolerable pain: she thought of nothing but revenge. How unlike what she was, the chearful, the prudent, the compassionate <HI>Ariana!</HI></P>
<P>She continually laboured to disturb an union so firmly, so affectionately founded, and planned every scheme which she thought most likely to disturb it.</P>
<P>Fortune seemed willing to promote her unjust intentions; the circumstances of <HI>Sabinus</HI> had been long embarrassed by a tedious law-suit, and the court determining the cause unexpectedly in favour of his opponent, it sunk his fortune to the lowest pitch of penury from the highest afflu∣ence.</P>
<P>From the nearness of relationship, <HI>Sabinus</HI> ex∣pected from <HI>Ariana</HI> those assistances his present situation required; but she was insensible to all his entreaties, and the justice of every remon∣strance, unless he first separated from <HI>Olinda,</HI> whom she regarded with detestation. Upon a compliance with her desires in this respect, she promised her fortune, her interest, and her all, should be at his command. <HI>Sabinus</HI> was shocked at the proposal; he loved his wife with inexpressible tenderness, and refused those offers with indignation which were to be purchased at
<PB N="104" REF="032200_0065_0FF184034CAEB828"/>
so high a price: <HI>Ariana</HI> was no less displeased to find her offers rejected, and give a loose to all that warmth which she had long endavoured to suppress.</P>
<P>Reproach generally produces recrimination; the quarrel rose to such a height, that <HI>Sabinus</HI> was marked for destruction; and the very next day, upon the strength of an old family debt, he was sent to jail, with none but <HI>Olinda</HI> to comfort him in his miseries. In this mansion of distress they lived together with resignation, and even with comfort. She provided the frugal meal, and he read for her while employed in the little offices of domestic concern. Their fellow-prisoners admired their contentment, and whenever they had a desire of relaxing into mirth, and enjoying those little comforts that a prison affords, <HI>Sabinus</HI> and <HI>Olinda</HI> were sure to be of the party. Instead of reproaching each for their mutual wretchedness, they both lightened it, by bearing each a share of the load imposed by providence. Whenever <HI>Sabinus</HI> shewed the least concern on his dear partner's account, she con∣jured him by the love he bore her; by those tender ties which now united them for ever, not to discompose himself: that so long as his affection lasted, she defied all the ills of fortune, and every loss of fame or friendship: that no∣thing could make her miserable, but his seem∣ing
<PB N="105" REF="032200_0065_0FF184034CAEB828"/>
to want happiness; nothing pleased but his sympathising with her pleasure.</P>
<P>A continuance in prison soon robbed them of the little the had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and famine began to make its horrid appearance; yet still was neither found to murmur: they both looked upon their little boy, who, insensible of their or his own distress, was playing about the room with inexpressible yet silent anguish, when a messenger came to inform them that <HI>Ari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a</HI> was dead; and that her will, in favour of a very distant relation, and who was now in another country, might be easily pro∣cured, and burnt; in which case, all her large fortune would revert to him, as being the next heir at law.</P>
<P>A proposal of so base a nature filled our un∣happy couple with horror; they ordered the mes∣senger immediately out of the room, and falling upon each other's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> indulged an agony of sorrow: for now even all hopes of relief were banished. The messenger who made the propo∣sal, however, was only a spy sent by <HI>Ariana</HI> to sound the diposition of a man she loved at once and persecuted.</P>
<P>This lady, though warped by wrong passions, was naturally kind, judicious and friendly. She found that all her attempts to shake the constancy or the integrity of <HI>Sabinus</HI> were ineffectual. She had, therefore, begun to reflect, and to wonder
<PB N="106" REF="032200_0066_0FF1840773B3F640"/>
how she could, so long and so unprovoked, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣jure such uncommon fortitude and affection.</P>
<P>She had, from the next room, herself heard the reception given to the messenger, and could not avoid feeling all the force of superior vir∣tue; she therefore reassumed her former goodness of heart; she came into the room with tears in her eyes, and acknowledged the severity of her former treatment. She bestowed her first care in providing them all the necessary supplies, and acknowledged them as the most deserving heirs of her fortune. From this moment <HI>Sabinus</HI> en∣joyed an uninterrupted happiness with <HI>Olinda,</HI> and both were happy in the friendship and assistance of <HI>Ariana,</HI> who, dying soon after, left them in possession of a large estate; and in her last mo∣ments confessed, that virtue, was the only path to true glory; and that, however Inocence may for a time be depressed a study preseverance will in a time lead it to a certain victory.</P>

<P>WHENCE this increased love of life, which grows upon us with our years? Whence comes it, that we thus make greater efforts to preserve our existence, at a period when it becomes scarce worth the keeping? Is it that nature, attentive to the preservation of mankind, increases our wishes to live, while she lessens our enjoyments; and, as she robs the senses of every plea∣sure, equips imagination in the spoil? Life would be insupportable to an old man, who, load∣ed with infirmities, feared death no more than when in the vigour of man-hood: the number∣less calamities of decaying nature, and the con∣sciousness of surviving every pleasure, would at once induce him, with his own hand, to termi∣nate the scene of misery; but happily the con∣tempt of death forsakes him at a time when it could only be prejudicial; and life acquires an imaginary value, in proportion as its real value is no more.</P>

with it. I would not chuse, says a <HI>French</HI> philosopher, to see an old post pulled up, with which I had been long acquainted. A mind long habituated to a certain set of objects, insensibly becomes fond of seeing them; visits them from habit, and parts from them with re∣luctance. From hence proceeds the avarice of the old in every kind of possession. They love the world, and all that it produces; they love life, and all its advantages; not because it gives them pleasure, but because they have known it long.</P>
<P>CHINVANG the Chaste, ascending the throne of <HI>China,</HI> commanded that all who were unjustly detained in prison, during the preceding reigns, should be set free. Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occa∣sion, there appeared a majestic old man, who, falling at the emperor's feet, addressed him as follows: "Great father of <HI>China,</HI> behold a wretch, now eighty-five years old, who was shut up in a dungeon at the age of twenty-two. I was imprisoned, though a stranger to crime, or without being even confronted by my accu∣sers. I have now lived in solitude and darkness for more than fifty years, and am grown familiar with distress. As yet dazzled with the splendor of that sun to which you have restored me, I have been wandering the streets, to find some friend that would assist, or relieve, or remember me; but my friends, my family, and relations,
<PB N="113" REF="032200_0069_0FF1840F84594418"/>
are all dead, and I am forgotten. Permit me then, O <HI>Chinvang,</HI> to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former prison: the walls of my dungeon are to me more pleasing than the most splendid palace; I have not long to live, and shall be unhappy except I spend the rest of my days where my youth was passed; in that prison from whence you were pleased to release me."</P>
<P>The old man's passion for confinement is similar to that we all have for life. We are habituated to the prison, we look round with discontent, are displeased with the abode, and yet the length of our captivity only increases our fondness for the cell. The trees we have planted, the houses we have built, or the posterity we have begotten, all serve to bind us closer to earth, and embitter our parting. Life sues the young like a new acquain∣tance; the companion, as yet unexhusted, is at once instructive and amusing; its company pleases yet, for all this, it is but little regarded. To us, who are declined in years, life appears like an old friend; its jests have been anticipated in former conversation; it has no new story to make us smile, no new improvement with which to surprise; yet still we love it: destitute of every agreement, still we love it; husband the wasting treasure with increased frugality, and feel all the poignan∣cy of anguish in the fatal separation.</P>

<P>Why man should thus feel pain; why our wretchedness should be requisite in the formation of universal felicity; why, when all other systems are made perfect only by the perfection of their subordinate parts, the great system should require for its perfection, parts that are not only subordi∣nate to others, but imperfect in themselves!—
<PB N="120" REF="032200_0073_0FF1841C9DF05268"/>
These are questions that never can be explain∣ed, and might be useless if known. On this subject, Providence has thought fit to elude our curiosity, satisfied with granting us motives to consolation.</P>
<P>In this situation, man has called in the friend∣ly assistance of Philosophy; and Heaven, see∣ing the incapacity of that to console him, has given him the aid of Religion. The consolati∣on of Philosophy are very amusing, but often fal∣lacious. It tells us, that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them; and, on on the other hand, that though we unavoidable have miseries here, life is short, and they will soon be over. Thus do these consolations de∣stroy each other; for if life is a place of com∣fort, its shortness must be misery; and, if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philoso∣phy is weak; but religion comforts in an higher strain. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and prepairing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body, and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making himself a heaven of happiness here; while the wretch that has been maimed and con∣taminated by his vices, shrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengence of Heaven. To Religion, then, we must hold, in every circumstance of life, for our truest comfort; for, if already we are happy,
<PB N="121" REF="032200_0073_0FF1841C9DF05268"/>
it is a pleasure to think that we can make that happiness unending; and, if we are miserable, it it very consoling to think that there is a place of rest. Thus, to the fortunate, Religion holds out a continuance of bliss: to the wretched, a change from pain.</P>
<P>But, though Religion is very kind to all men, it has promised peculiar rewards to the unhap∣py; the sick, the naked, the houseless, the heavy-laden, and the prisoner, have ever most frequent promises in our sacred law. The Author of our Religion every where professes himself the wretch's friend; and, unlike the false ones of this world, bestows all his caresses upon the for∣lorn. The unthinking have censured this as a partiality, as a preference without merit to de∣serve it; but they never reflect, that it is not in the power even of Heaven itself to make the offer of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miserable. To the first, eterni∣ty is but a single blessing, since, at most, it but increases what they already possess. To the latter it is a double advantage; for it diminishes their pain here, and rewards them with heaven∣ly bliss hereafter.</P>
<P>But Providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than the rich; for, as it thus makes the life after death more desirable, so it smooths the passage there. The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man
<PB N="122" REF="032200_0074_0FF18422511FF110"/>
of sorrow lays himself quietly down; he has no possessions to regret, and but few ties to stop his departure; he feels only Nature's pang in the final separation, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for, after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the constitution, nature kind∣ly covers with insensibility.</P>
<P>Thus Providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life, greater felicity in dying, and, in Heaven, all the supe∣riority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment. And this superiority, my friends, is no small advantage, and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable; for, though he was already in Heaven, and felt all the raptures it could give, yet it was men∣tioned as an addition to his happiness, that he had once been wretched, and now was com∣forted; that he had known what it was to be miserable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, my friends, you see Religion does what Philosophy could never do: it shews the equal dealings of Heaven to the happy and the un∣happy, and levels all human enjoyments to near∣ly the same standard. It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter, and equal hopes to aspire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here, the poor have the endless satisfaction of know∣ing
<PB N="123" REF="032200_0074_0FF18422511FF110"/>
what it was once to be miserable, when crowned with endless felicity hereafter; and even though this should be called a small advan∣tage, yet, being an eternal one, it must make up, by duration, what the temporal happiness of the great may have exceeded by intenseness.</P>
<P>These are, therefore, the consolations which the wretched have peculiar to themselves, and in which they are above the rest of mankind; in other respects they are below them. They who would know the miseries of the poor, must see life and endure it. To declaim on the tem∣poral advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none either believed or practise. The men who have the necessaries of living are not poor, and they who want them must be misera∣ble. Yes, my friends, we must be miserable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can soothe the wants of nature, can give elastic sweet∣ness to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ease to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the Philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these. Alas! the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain! Death is slight, and any man may substain it; but torments are dreadful, and these no man can endure.</P>
<P>To us, then, my friends, the promises of happiness in Heaven should be peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are
<PB N="124" REF="032200_0075_0FF1842402005058"/>
then, indeed, of all men the most miserable. When I look round these gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us; this light that only serves to shew the horrors of the place, those shackles that tyranny has imposed, or crimes made necessary; when I survey these emaciated looks, and hear those groans, O my friends, what a glorious exchange would Heaven be for these! To fly through regions unconfin∣ed as air; to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss; to carol over endless hymns of praise; to have no master to threaten or insult us, but the form of Goodness himself for ever in our eyes; when I think of these things, Death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings; when I think of these things, his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of my support; when I think of these things, what is there in life worth having? when I think of these things, what is there that should not be spurned away? Kings in their palaces should groan for such advantages; but we, humbled as we are, should yearn for them.</P>
<P>And shall these things be ours? Ours they will certainly be, if we but try for them; and, what is a comfort, we are shut up from many temptations that would retard our pursuit. Only let us try for them, and they will certainly be ours, and, what is still a comfort, shortly too; for, if we look back on past life, it appears but a very short span; and, whatever we may think
<PB N="125" REF="032200_0075_0FF1842402005058"/>
of the rest of life, it will yet be found of less duration: as we grow older, the days seem to grow shorter, and our intimacy with time ever lessens the perception of his stay. Then let us take comfort now, for we shall soon be at our journey's end; we shall soon lay down the heavy burthen laid by Heaven upon us; and though Death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and, like his horizon, still flies before him; yet the time will certainly and shortly come, when be shall cease from our toil; when the luxurious great ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth; when we shall think with pleasure on our sufferings below; when we shall be surrounded with all our friends, or such as deserved our friendship; when our bliss shall be unutterable, and still, to crown all, unending.</P>

Persecution only serves to propagate new religions; they acquire fresh vigour beneath the executioner and the ax, and, like some vivaci∣ous insects, multiply by dissection.

<HEAD>STORY OF COLONEL. M—.</HEAD>
<P>AT the conclusion of the treaty of peace at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> Col. <HI>M</HI>—was one of the thoughtless, agreeable, gay creatures, that drew the atten∣tion of the company at <HI>Bath.</HI> He danced and talked with great vivacity; and when he gamed among the ladies, he showed, that his attention was employed rather upon their hearts than their fortunes. His own fortune, however was a trifle, when compared to the elegance of his expence; and his imprudence at last was so great that it oblidged him to sell an
<PB N="129" REF="032200_0077_0FF18428CFA589F8"/>
annuity, arising from his commission, to keep up his splendor a little longer.</P>
<P>However thoughtless he might be, he had the happiness of gaining the affections of Miss <HI>L</HI>—, whose father designed her a very large fortune. This lady was courted by a nobleman of distinc¦tion; but she refused his addresses, resolved up∣on gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice. The intrigue went on successfully be∣tween her and the Colonel, and they both would certainly have been married, and been undone, had not Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> apprised her father of their intentions. The old gentleman recalled his daughter from <HI>Bath,</HI> and offered Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> a very considerable present, for the care he had ta∣ken, which he refused.</P>
<P>In the mean time Col. <HI>M</HI>—had an inti∣mation how his intrigue came to be discovered; and by taxing Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> found that his suspici∣ons were not without foundation. A challenge was the immediate consequence; which the King of <HI>Bath,</HI> conscious of having only done his duty, thought proper to decline. As none are permitted to wear swords at <HI>Bath,</HI> the Co∣lonel found no opportunity of gratifying his re∣sentment, and waited with impatience to find Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> in town, to require proper satisfaction.</P>
<P>During this interval, however, he found his creditors became too importunate for him to re∣main longer at <HI>Bath;</HI> and his finances and cre∣dit
<PB N="130" REF="032200_0078_0FF1842E3551CBA8"/>
being quite exhausted, he took the desperate resolution of going over to the <HI>Dutch</HI> army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he enlisted himself a volun∣teer. Here he underwent all the fatigues of a private centinel, with the additional misery of receiving no pay; and his friends in <HI>En∣gland</HI> gave o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, that he was shot at the battle of—,</P>
<P>In the mean time, the nobleman pressed his passion with ardour; but, during the progress of his amour, the young lady's father died, and left her heiress to a fortune of fifteen hundred a year. She thought herself now disengaged from her former passion. An absence of two years had in some measure abated her love for the Colonel; and the assiduity, the merit, and real regard, of the gentleman who still continu∣ed to solicit her, were almost too powerful for her constancy, Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> in the mean time, took every opportunity of enquiring after Col, <HI>M</HI>—, and found that he had for some time been returned to <HI>England,</HI> but changed his name, in order to avoid the fury of his credi∣tors; and that he was entered into a company of strolling players, who were at that time ex∣hibiting at <HI>Peterborough.</HI></P>
<P>He now therefore thought he owed the Colo∣nel, in justice, an opportunity of promoting his fortune, as he had once deprived him of an occasion of satsfying his love. Our Beau, there∣fore
<PB N="131" REF="032200_0078_0FF1842E3551CBA8"/>
invited the lady to be of a party to <HI>Peter∣borough,</HI> and offered his own equipage, which was then one of the most elegant in <HI>England,</HI> to conduct her there. The proposal being ac∣cepted, the lady, the nobleman, and Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> arrived in town just as the players were going to begin.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>M</HI>—, who used every means of re∣maining <HI>incognito,</HI> and who was too proud to make his distresses known to any of his former acquaintances, was now degraded into the cha∣racter of <HI>Tom</HI> in the <HI>Conscious Lovers.</HI> Miss <HI>L</HI>—was placed in the foremost row of the spectators, her lord on one side, and the impa∣tient <HI>Nash</HI> on the other, when the unhappy youth appeared in that despicable situation upon the stage. The moment he came on, his former mistress struck his view; but his amazement was increased, when he saw her fainting away in the arms of those who sat behind her. He was incapable of proceeding; and, scarce know∣ing what he did, he flew and caught her in his arms.</P>
<P>"Colonel," cried <HI>Nash,</HI> when they were in some measure recovered, "you once thought me your enemy, because I endeavoured to pre∣vent you both, from ruining each other; you were then wrong, and you have long had my forgiveness. If you love well enough now for matrimony, you fairly have my consent; and

<HEAD>MISERIES OF GENIUS IN VARI∣OUS AGES, AND HER HAP∣PINESS IN THIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of a poet is in every country the same; fond of enjoying the present, care∣less of the future; his conversation that of a man of sense, his actions those of a fool! Of fortitude able to stand unmoved at the burst∣ing of an earthquake, yet of sensibility to be affected by the breaking of a tea-cup. Such is his character; which, considered in every light, is the very opposite of that which leads to riches.</P>
<P>The poets of the West are as remarkable for their indigence as their genius; and yet, among the numerous hospitals designed to re∣lieve the poor, I have heard of but one erected for the benefit of decayed authors. This was founded by Pope <HI>Urban</HI> VIII. and called the retreat of the incurables; intimating, that it was equally impossible to reclaim the patients, who sued for reception, from poverty, or from poetry. To be sincere; were I to send you an account of the lives of the Western poets, either ancient or modern, I fancy you would think me empoy∣ed in collecting meterials for an history of hu∣man wretchedness.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="032200_0080_0FF18431DAB5EBD0"/>
<HI>Homer</HI> is the first poet and beggar of note among the ancients; he was blind, and sung his ballads about the streets; but it is observed, that his mouth was more frequently filled with verses than with bread. <HI>Plautus,</HI> the comic poet, was better off; he had two trades, he was a poet for his diversion, and helped to turn a mill in order to gain a livelihood. <HI>Terence</HI> was a slave, and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thius</HI> died in a jail.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Italians, Paulo Borghese,</HI> almost as good a poet as <HI>Tasso,</HI> knew fourteen different trades, and yet died because he could get em∣ployment in none. <HI>Tasso</HI> himself, who had the most amiable characted of all poets, has often been oblidged to borrow a crown from some friend, in order to pay for a months subsistence. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has left us a pretty sonnet, addressed to his cat, in which he begs the light of her eys to write by, being too poor to afford himself a candle. But <HI>Bentivoglio,</HI> poor <HI>Bentivoglio!</HI> chiefly de∣mands our pity. His comedies will last with the <HI>Italian</HI> language. He dissipated a noble fortune in acts of charity and benevolence; but, falling into misery in his old age, was refused to be admitted into an hospital which he himself had erected.</P>
<P>In <HI>Spain</HI> it is said, the great <HI>Cervantes</HI> died of hunger; and it is certain that the famous <HI>Camoens</HI> ended his days in an hospital.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="032200_0080_0FF18431DAB5EBD0"/>
If we turn to <HI>France,</HI> we shall there find even stronger instances of the ingratitude of the pub∣lic. <HI>Vaugelas,</HI> one of the politest writers, and one of the honestest men, of his time, was surnamed <HI>the Owl,</HI> from his being obliged to keep within all day, and venture out only by night, through fear of his creditors. His last will is very remarkable: after having bequeathed all his worldly substance to the discharging his debts, he goes on thus: But as there still may remain some creditors unpaid, even after all that I have shall be disposed of, in such a case, it is my last will, that my body should be sold to the surgeons, to the best advantage, and that the purchase should go to the discharging those debts which I owe to society; so that if I could not while living, at least when dead, I may be useful.</P>
<P><HI>Cassander</HI> was one of the greatest geniuses of his time; yet all his merit could not procure him a bare subsistence. Being by degrees driv∣en into an hatred of all mankind, from the little pity he found amongst them, he even ven∣tured at last ungratefully to impute his calami∣ties to Providence. In his last agonies, when the priest intreated him to rely on the justice of heaven, and ask mercy from him that made him; <HI>If God,</HI> replies he, <HI>has shewn me no justice here, what reason have I to expect any from him hereafter?</HI> But being answered, that a suspension
<PB N="136" REF="032200_0081_0FF18433A9A46680"/>
of justice was no argument that should induce us to doubt of its reality; let me intreat you, continued his confessor, by all that is dear, to be reconciled to God, your father, your maker, and friend. <HI>No,</HI> replied the exasperated wretch, <HI>you know the manner in which he left me to live;</HI> (and pointing to the straw on which he was stretched) <HI>and you see the manner in which he leaves me to die!</HI></P>
<P>But the sufferings of the poet in other coun∣tries is nothing when compared to his distresses here: the names of <HI>Spenser</HI> and <HI>Otway, Butler</HI> and <HI>Dryden,</HI> are every day mentioned as a na∣tional reproach; some of them lived in a state of precarious indigence, and others literally died of hunger.</P>
<P>At present, the few poets in <HI>England</HI> no long∣er depend on the Great for subsistence; they have now no other patrons but the public; and the public, collectively considered, is a good and a generous master. It is, indeed, too fre∣quently the mistaken as to the merits of every candidate for favour; but, to make amends, it is never mistaken long. A performance, indeed, may be forced for a time into reputation; but, destitute of real merit, it soon sinks: time, the touchstone of what is truly valuable, will soon discover the fraud; and an author should never arrogate to himself any share of success,
<PB N="137" REF="032200_0081_0FF18433A9A46680"/>
till his works have been read at least ten years with satisfaction.</P>
<P>A man of letters, at present, whose works are valuable, is perfectly sensibly of their value. Every polite member of the community, by buy∣ing what he writes, contributes to reward him.

A writer of real merit, now, may easily be rich, if his heart be set only on fortune: and for those who have no merit, it is but fit that such should remain in merited obscurity. He may now refuse an invitation to dinner, without fear∣ing to incur his patron's displeasure, or to starve by remaining at home. He may now venture to appear in company with just such cloaths as other men generally wear; and talk, even to princes, with all the conscious superiority of wis∣dom. Though he cannot boast of fortune here, yet he can bravely assert the dignity of inde∣pendance.</P>

<HEAD>PLEASURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE enthusiasm of pleasure charms only by intervals. The highest rapture lasts only for a moment, and all the senses seem so combined, as to be soon tired into languor by the gratifica∣tion of any one of them. It is only among the Poets we hear of men changing to one delight, when satiated with another. In nature, it is very different; the glutton, when sated with the full meal, is unqualified to feel the real pleasure of drinking; the drunkard, in turn, finds few of those transports which lovers boast in enjoyment; and the lover, when cloyed, finds a diminution of every other appetite. Thus, after a full in∣dulgence of any one sense, the man of pleasure finds a langour in all, is placed in a chasm be∣tween past and expected enjoyment, preceives an interval which must be filled up. The present
<PB N="144" REF="032200_0085_0FF18441CAD94860"/>
can give no satisfaction, because he has already robbed it of every charm. A mind thus left without immediate employment, naturally recurs to the past or the future: the reflector finds that he was happy, and knows that he cannot be so now; he sees that he may yet be happy, and wishes the hour was come: thus every period of his continuance is miserable, except that very short one of immediate gratification. Instead of a life of dissipation, none has more frequent con∣versations with disagreeable <HI>self</HI> than he: his enthusiasms are but few and transient; his appe∣tites, like angry creditors, continually making fruitless demands for what he is unable to pay; and the greater his former pleasure, the more strong his regret, the more impatient his expec∣tations. A life of pleasure is, therefore, the most unpleasing life in the world.</P>
<P>Habit has rendered the man of business more cool in his desires; he finds less regret for past pleasures, and less solicitude for these to come. The life he now leads, though tainted in some measure with hope, is yet not afflicted so strongly with regret, and is less divided between short-lived rapture and lasting anguish. The pleasures he has enjoyed are not so vivid, and those he has to expect cannot consequently create so much anxiety.</P>
<P>The philosopher, who extends his regard to all mankind, must have still a smaller concern for
<PB N="145" REF="032200_0085_0FF18441CAD94860"/>
what has already affected, or may hereafter affect himself; the concerns of others make his whole study, and that study is his pleasure; and this pleasure is continuing in its nature, because it can be changed at will, leaving but few of these anxi∣ous intervals which are employed in remem∣brance or anticipation. The philosopher, by this means, leads a life of almost continued dissipa∣tion; and reflection, which makes the uneasiness and misery of others, serves as a companion and instructor to him.</P>
<P>In a word, positive happiness is constitution∣al, and incapable of increase; misery is arti∣ficial, and generally proceeds from our folly. Philosophy can add to our happiness in no other manner, but by diminishing our misery: it should not pretend to increase our present stock, but make us oeconomists of what we are possessed of. The great source of calamity lies in regret or anticipation: he, therefore, is most wise, who thinks of the present alone, regardless of the past or the future. This is impossible to the man of pleasure; it is difficult to the man of business; and is, in some measure, attainable by the philosopher. Happy were we all born philosophers, all born with a talent of thus dissi∣pating our own cares, by spreading them upon all mankind!</P>

<HEAD>THE MERCHANT's CLERK.</HEAD>
<P>IT is usually said by grammarians, that the use of language is to express our wants and de∣sires; but men who know the world, hold, and I think with some shew of reason, that he who best knows how to keep his necessities private, is the most likely person to have them redressed; and that the true use of speech is not so much to express our wants as to conceal them.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the manner in which mankind generally confer their favours, there ap∣pears something so attractive in riches, that the
<PB N="150" REF="032200_0088_0FF1844947BA5138"/>
large heap generally collects from the smaller: and the poor find as much pleasure in increasing the enormous mass of the rich, as the miser, who owns it, sees happiness in its increase. Nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of morality. <HI>Seneca</HI> himself allows, that in confering benefits, the present should always be suited to the dignity of the receiver. Thus the rich receive large presents, and are thank∣ed for accepting them. Men of middling sta∣tions are obliged to be content with presents something less; while the beggar, who may be truly said to want indeed, is well paid if a farthing rewards his warmest solicitations.</P>
<P>Every man who has seen the world, and has had his ups and downs in life, as the expression is, must have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine; and must know, that to have much, or to seem to have it, is the only way to have more. <HI>Ovid</HI> finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column; the lower it sinks, the greater is that weight it is obliged to sustain. Thus, when a man's circumstances are such that he has no occasion to borrow, he finds numbers willing to lend him; but, should his wants be such that he sues for a trifle, it is two to one whether he may be trusted with the smallest sum. A certain young fellow, whom I knew, whenever he had occasion to ask his friend for a guinea, used to prelude his request as if he
<PB N="151" REF="032200_0088_0FF1844947BA5138"/>
wanted two hundred; and talked so familiarly of large sums, that none could ever think he wanted a small one. The same gentleman, when∣ever he wanted credit for a suit of clothes, al∣ways made the proposal in a laced coat; for he found by experience, that, if he appeared shabby on these occasions, his tailor had taken an oath against trusting; or, what was every whit as bad, his foreman was out of the way, and should not be at home for some time</P>
<P>There can be no inducements to reveal our wants, except to find pity, and, by this means, relief; but before a poor man opens his mind in such circumstances, he should first consider whe∣ther he is contented to lose the esteem of the person he solicits, and whether he is willing to give up friendship to excite compassion. Pity and Friendship are passions incompatible with each other; and it is impossible that both can reside in any breast for the smallest space, with∣out impairing each other. Friendship is made up of esteem and pleasure; Pity is composed of sorrow and contempt; the mind may, for some time, fluctuate between them, but it can never entertain both at once.</P>
<P>In fact, Pity, though it may often relieve, is but, at best, a short-lived passion, and seldom affords distress more than a transitory assistance: with some it scarce lasts from the first impulse till the hand can be put into the pocket; with
<PB N="152" REF="032200_0089_0FF1844C2A788F00"/>
others, it may continue for twice that space; and on some, of extraordinary sensibility, I have seen it operate for half an hour together: but still, last as it may, it generally produces but beggarly effects; and where, from this motive, we give five farthings, from others, we give pounds. Whatever be our feelings from the first impulse of distress, when the same distress solicits a second, we then feel with diminished sensibility; and, like the repetition of an echo, every stroke becomes weaker; 'till, at last, our sensations lose all mixture of sorrow, and degen∣erate into downright contempt.</P>
<P>These speculations bring to my mind the fate of a very good-natured fellow, who is now no more. He was bred in a compting-house, and his father dying just as he was out of his time, left him an handsome fortune, and many friends to advise with. The restraint in which my friend had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his temper, which some regarded as pru∣dence; and, from such considerations, he had every day repeated offers of friendship. Such as had money, were ready to offer him their assistance that way; and they who had daugh∣ters, frequently, in the warmth of affection, ad∣vised him to marry. My friend, however, was in good circumstances; he wanted neither mo∣ney, friends, nor a wife; and, therefore, modest∣ly declined their proposals.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="032200_0089_0FF1844C2A788F00"/>
Some errors, however, in the management of his affairs, and several losses in trade, soon brought him to a different way of thinking; and he at last considered, that it was his best way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable. His first address was to a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>A few lines her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are borrowed, with a slight alteration, from the Man of the World, p.</HI> 65. <HI>of this Volume.</HI></NOTE> scrivener, who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friendship, at a time when, perhaps, he knew those offers would have been refused. As a man, therefore, confident of not being refused, he requested the use of a hundred guineas for a few days, as he just then had occa∣sion for money. <Q>And pray, Sir, replied the scrivener, do you want all this money?</Q> <Q>Want it, Sir? says the other, If I did not want it, I should not have asked it.</Q> <Q>I am sorry for that, says the friend; for those who want money when they borrow, will always want money when they should come to pay. To say the truth, Sir, money is money now; and, I believe, it is all sunk in the bottom of the sea, for my part; he that has got a little, is a fool if he does not keep what he has got.</Q></P>
<P>Not quite disconcerted by this refusal, our adventurer was resolved to apply to another,
<PB N="154" REF="032200_0090_0FF1845042176298"/>
who he knew was the very best friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addressed, received his proposal with all the affa∣bility that could be expected from generous friendship. <Q>Let me see—you want an hundred guineas—and pray, dear Jack, would not fifty answer?</Q> <Q>If you have but fifty to spare, Sir, I must be contented.</Q> <Q>Fifty to spare! I do not say that; for, I believe, I have but twenty about me.</Q> <Q>Then I must borrow the other thirty from some other friend.</Q> <Q>And pray, replied the friend, would it not be the best way to borrow the whole mo∣ney from that other friend, and then one note will serve for all, you know?—You know, my dear Sir, that you need make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I'm your friend; and, when you chuse a bit of dinner, or so—You, Tom! see the gentleman down. You won't forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble servant.</Q></P>
<P>Distressed, but not discouraged, at this treat∣ment, he was at last resolved to find that assist∣ance from love, which he could not have from friendship. A young lady, a distant relation by the mother's side, had a fortune in her own hands; and, as she had already made all the ad∣vances that her sex's modesty would permit, he made his proposal with confidence. He soon, however, preceived, That no bankrupt ever

found the fair-one kind. She had lately fallen deeply in love with another, who had more money, and the whole neighbourhood thought it would be a match.</P>
<P>Every day now began to strip my poor friend of his former finery; his cloaths flew, piece by piece, to the pawnbroker's, and he seemed, at length, equipped in the genuine livery of mis∣fortune. But still he thought himself secure from actual necessity; the numberless invitations he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad received to dine, even after his losses, were yet unanswered: he was therefore now resolved to accept of a dinner, because he want∣ed one; and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week, without being openly affronted. The last place I saw him in, was at a reverend divine's. He had, as he fancied, just nicked the time of dinner; for he came in as the cloth was laying. He took a chair without being desired, and talked for some time without being attended to. He assured the company, that nothing procured so good an appetite as a walk in the Park, where he had been that morning. He went on, and praised the figure of the damask table-cloth; talked of a feast where he had been the day before, but that the venison was over-done: but all this procured him no invitation. Finding, therefore, the gentleman of the house insensible to all his fetches, he thought proper, at last, to retire,
<PB N="156" REF="032200_0091_0FF1849161086008"/>
and mend his appetite by a second walk in the Park.</P>
<P>You, then, O ye beggars of my acquaintance, whether in rags or lace; whether in <HI>Kent-street</HI> or the <HI>Mall;</HI> whether at the <HI>Smyrna</HI> or St. <HI>Giles'</HI>s; might I be permitted to advise as a friend, never seem to want the favour which you solicit. Apply to every passion but human pity for redress: you may find permanent relief from vanity, from self-interest, or from avarice; but from compassion never. The very eloquence of a poor man is disgusting; and that mouth which is opened even by wisdom, is seldom expected to close without the horrors of a petition.</P>
<P>To ward off the gripe of poverty, you must pretend to be a stranger to her, and she will at least use you with ceremony. If you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porringer of pease-soup and potatoes, praise the wholesomeness of your frugal repast: you may observe that Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> has prescribed pease-broth for the gravel; hint that you are not one of those who are always making a deity of your belly.

If you be a philosopher, hint that <HI>Plato</HI> or <HI>Seneca</HI> are the taylors you choose to employ; assure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering; since what now is so much his pride was formerly his shame. In short, however caught, never give out; but ascribe to the frugality of your disposition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowness of your circumstances.

earth, to which they had foolishly attached an idea of happiness! Their distresses were pleasures, compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring. They ate, drink, and sleep; they have slaves to attend them, and were sure of subsistence for life: while many of their fellow-creatures are obliged to wander without a friend to comfort or assist them, and even without shelter from the seve∣rity of the season.</P>
<P>I have been led into these reflections, from ac∣cidentally meeting, some days ago, a poor fellow, whom I knew when a boy, dressed in a sailor's jacket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been honest and industrous when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation; wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I desired to know the history of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduced to his present distress. The disabled soldier, for such he was, though dressed in a sailor's habit, scratching his head, and leaning on his cruch, put himself into an attitude to comply with my request, and gave me his history, as follows.</P>
<P>"AS for my misfortune, master, I can't pre∣tend to have gone through any more than other folks; for, except the loss of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,

<P>"I was born in <HI>Shropshire;</HI> my father was a labourer, and died when I was five years old; so I was put upon the parish. As he had been a wandering sort of a man, the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged, or where I was born; so they sent me to another pa∣rish, and that parish sent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept sending me about so long, that they would not let me be born in any parish at all; but, at last, however, they fixed me. I had some disposition to be a scholar, and was resolved, at least, to know my letters; but the master of the work house put me to business as soon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an easy kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not suffered to stir out of the house, for fear, as they said, I should run away. But what of that? I had the liberty of the whole house, and the yard before the door; and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my business well enough, till he died, when I was obliged
<PB N="161" REF="032200_0093_0FF18454CF95CEA0"/>
to provide for myself; so I was resolved to go seek my fortune.</P>
<P>"In this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and starv∣ed when I could get none; when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a justice of peace, I spied a hare crossing the path just before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at it. Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bring∣ing it away, when the justice himself met me: he called me a poacher and a villain; and, col∣laring me desired I would give an account of myself. I fell upon my knees, begged his wor∣ship's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, seed, and ge∣neration; but, though I gave a very true ac∣count, the justice said I could give no account; so I was indicted at the sessions, found guilty of being poor, and sent up to <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> in order to be transported as a vagabond.</P>
<P>"People may say this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found <HI>Newgate</HI> as a∣greeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life.

We had but an indifferent passage; for, being

all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of sweet air; and those that remained were sickly enough, God knows. When we came a-shore, we were sold to the planters, and I was bound for seven years more. As I was no scholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the ne∣groes; and I served out my time, as in duty bound to do.</P>
<P>"When my time was expired, I worked my passage home; and glad I was to see <HI>Old England</HI> again, because I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I should be indicted for a vaga∣bond once more, so did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs, when I could get them.</P>
<P>"I was very happy in this manner for some time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then desired me to stand. They belonged to the press-gang. I was carried before the justice, and, as I could give no account of myself, I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or list for a soldier. I chose the latter; and, in this post of gentleman, I served two campaigns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> was at the battles of <HI>Val</HI> and <HI>Fontenoy,</HI> and received but one wound, through the breast here; but the doctor of our regiment soon made me well again.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="032200_0094_0FF18457F01F4278"/>
"When the peace came on, I was discharg∣ed; and, as I could not work, because my wound was somtimes troublesome, I listed for a landsman in the <HI>East-India</HI> company's service. I have fought the <HI>French</HI> in six pitched battles; and I verily believe, that if I could read or write, our Captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I soon fell sick, and so got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocked. This was at the beginning of the pre∣sent war, and I hoped to be set on shore, and to have the pleasure of spending my money; but the government wanted men, and so I was pressed for a sailor before ever I could set foot on shore.</P>
<P>"The boatswain found, as he said, an ob∣stinate fellow: he swore he knew that I under∣stood my business well, but that I shammed <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> to be idle; but God knows, I knew no∣thing of sea-business, and he beat me without considering what he was about. I had still, however, my forty pounds, and that was some comfort to me under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our ship was taken by the French, and so I lost all.</P>
<P>"Our crew was carried into <HI>Brest,</HI> and many of them died, because they were not used to live in jail; but for my part, it was nothing to
<PB N="164" REF="032200_0095_0FF1845C5335E090"/>
me, for I was seasoned. One night, as I was asleep on my bed of boards, with a warm blan∣ket about me, (for I always loved to lie well) I was awakened by the boatswain, who had a dark lantern in his hand. <Q><HI>Jack,</HI> says he to me, will you knock out the <HI>French</HI> centry's brains?</Q> "I don't care," says I, striving to keep myself awake "if I lend a hand." <Q>Then follow me, says he, and I hope we shall do business.</Q> So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the clothes I had, about my middle, and went with him to sight the <HI>Frenchman.</HI> I hate the <HI>French,</HI> because they are all slaves, and wear wooden shoes.</P>
<P>"Though we had no arms, one <HI>Englishman</HI> is able to beat five <HI>French</HI> at any time; so we went down to the door, where both the centries were posted, and, rushing upon them, seized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence, nine of us ran together to the quay, and seizing the first boat we met, got out of the harbour, and put to sea. We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the <HI>Dorset</HI> privateer, who were glad of so many good hands; and we consented to run our chance. However, we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the <HI>Pompadour</HI> privater, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; so to it we went yard∣arm
<PB N="165" REF="032200_0095_0FF1845C5335E090"/>
and yard-arm. The fight lasted for three hours, and I verily believe we should have taken the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> had we but had some more men left behind; but, unfortunately, we lost all our men just as we were going to get the victory.</P>
<P>"I was once more in the power of the <HI>French,</HI> and, I believe, it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to <HI>Brest;</HI> but, by good fortune, we were retaken by the Viper. I had almost forgot to tell you, that, in that engage∣ment, I was wounded in two places: I lost four fingers off the left hand, and my leg was shot off. If I had had the good fortune to have lost my leg and use of my hand on board a king's ship, and not a board a privateer, I should have been entitled to clothing and maintenance during the rest of my life, but that was not my chance: one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, blessed be God! I enjoy good health, and will, for ever, love liberty and Old England. Li∣berty, property, and Old England, for ever, huzza!"</P>
<P>Thus saying, he limped off, leaving me in ad∣miration at his intrepidity and content; nor could I avoid acknowledging, that an habitual ad∣quaintance with misery serves better than philo∣sophy to teach us to dispise it.</P>

<P>MEN complain of not finding a place of re∣pose. They are in the wrong; they have it for seeking. What they should, indeed, complain of, is, that the heart is an enemy to what the seek, To themselves, alone, should they impute their discontent.

One month passes, and another comes on; the year ends, and then be∣gins; but man is still unchanging in folly, still blindly continuing in prejudice.

<HEAD>THE PHILOSOPHIC COBLER.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH not very fond of seeing a pageant myself, yet I am generally pleased with being in the crowd which sees it; it is amusing to observe the effect which such a spectacle has upon the variety of faces; the pleasure it excites in some, the envy in others, and the wishes it raises in all. With this design I lately went to see the entry of a foreign ambassador, resolved to make one in the mob, to shout as they shouted, to fix with earnestness upon the same frivolous objects, and
<PB N="168" REF="032200_0097_0FF184625F5A88F8"/>
participate, for a while, the pleasures and the wishes of the vulgar.</P>
<P>Struggling here for some time, in order to be first to see the cavalcade as it passed, some one of the crowd unluckily happened to tread upon my shoe, and tore it in such a manner, that I was utterly unqualified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> march forward with the main body, and oblidged to fall back in the rear, Thus rendered incapable of being a spectator of the shew myself, I was at least willing to observe the spectators, and limped behind like one of the invalids which follow the march of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> army.</P>
<P>In this plight, as I was considering the eager∣ness that appeared on every face, how some bustled to get foremost, and others contented themselves with taking a trasient peep when they could; how some praised the four black servants that were stuck behind one of the equipages, and some the ribbons that decorated the horses' necks in another; my attention was called off to an object more extraordinary than any that I had yet seen: A poor Cobler sat in his stall by the way side, and continued to work while the crowd passed by, without testifying the smallest share of curiosity. I own his want of attention excited mine; and, as I stood in need of his assistance, I thought it best to employ a Philoso∣phic Cobler on this occasion: perceiving my business, therefore, he desired me to enter and
<PB N="169" REF="032200_0097_0FF184625F5A88F8"/>
sit down, took my shoe in his lap, and began to mend it with his usual indifference and taciturnity.</P>
<P><Q>How, my friend, said I to him, can you continue to work while all those fine things are passing by your door?</Q> <Q>Very fine they are, master, returned the cobler, for those that like them, to be sure; but what are all those fine things to me? You don't know what it is to be a cobler, and so much the better for yourself. Your bread is baked; you may go and see sights the whole day, and eat a warm supper when you come home at night; but for me, if I should run hunting after all these fine folk, what should I get by my journey but an appetite? and, God help me, I have too much of that at home <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ready, without stirring out for it. Your people who may eat four meals a day, and supper at night are but a bad example to such a one as I. No, master, as God has called me into this world in order to mend old shoes, I have no business with fine folk, and they no business with me.</Q> I here interrupted him with a smile. <Q>See this last, master, continues he, and this ham∣mer; this last and hammer are the two best friends I have in this world; nobody else will be my friend, because I want a friend. The great folks you saw pass by just now have five hundred friends, because they have no ocasion
<PB N="170" REF="032200_0098_0FF18465482BE370"/>
for them. Now, while I stick to my good friends here, I am very contented; but, when I ever so little run after sights and fine things, I begin to hate my work, I grow sad, and have no heart to mend shoes any longer.</Q></P>
<P>This discourse only served to raise my curiosity to know more of a man whom Nature had thus formed into a Philosopher. I therefore insensi∣bly led him into an history of his adventures:—<Q>I have lived, said he, a wandering life, now five-and-fifty years, here to-day and gone to∣morrow; for it was my misfortune, when I was young, to be fond of changing.</Q> <Q><HI>You have been a traveller, then, I presume?</HI> inter∣rupted I.</Q> <Q>I can't boast much of travelling, continued he, for I have never left the parish in which I was born but three times in my life, that I can remember; but then there is not a street in the whole neighbourhood that I have not lived in, at some time or another. When I began to settle, and to take to my business in one street, some unforeseen misfor∣tune, or a desire of trying my luck elsewhere, has removed me, perhaps, a whole mile away from my former customers, while some more lucky cobler would come into my place, and make a handsome fortune among friends of my making: there was one who actually died in a stall that I had left, worth seven pounds
<PB N="171" REF="032200_0098_0FF18465482BE370"/>
seven shillings, all in hard gold, which he had quilted into the waistband of his breeches.</Q></P>
<P>I could not but smile at these migrations of a man by the fire-side, and continued to ask if he had ever been married. <Q>Ay, that I have, mas∣ter, replied he, for sixteen long years; and a weary life I had of it, Heaven knows. My wife took it into her head, that the only way to thrive in this world was to save money; so, though our comings-in was but about three shillings a week, all that ever she could lay her hands upon she used to hide away from me, though we were obliged to starve the whole week for it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The first three years we used to quarrel about this every day, and I always got the better; but she had a hard spirit, and still con∣tinued to hide as usual; so that I was at last tired of quarrelling, and geting the better; and she scraped and scraped at pleasure, 'till I was almost starved to death. Her conduct drove me, at last, in dispair to the alehouse; here I used to sit with people who hated home like myself, drank while I had money left, and run in score while any body would trust me; 'till at last the landlady, coming one day with a long bill when I was from home, and putting it into my wife's hands, the length of it effec∣tually broke her heart. I searched the whole stall, after she was dead, for money; but she
<PB N="172" REF="032200_0099_0FF184681E2A4E28"/>
had hidden it so effectually, that, with all my pains, I could never find a farthing.</Q></P>
<P>By this time my shoe was mended, and, satis∣fying the poor artist for his trouble, and reward∣ing him besides for his information, I took my leave, and returned home to lengthen out the amusement his conversation afforded, by com∣municating it to my friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHARITY OF THE ENGLISH.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I sometimes lament the cause of humanity, and the depravity of human nature, there now and then appear gleams of greatness that serve to relieve the eye oppressed with the hideous prospect, and resemble those cultivated spots that are sometimes found in the midst of an Asiatic wilderness. I see many superior ex∣cellencies among the <HI>English,</HI> which it is not in the power of all their follies to hide: I see virtues which, in other countries, are known only to a few, practised here by every rank of people.</P>
<P>I know not whether it proceeds from their superior opulence, that the <HI>English</HI> are more cha∣ritable than the rest of mankind; whether, by being possessed of all the conveniencies of life themselves, they have more leisure to perceive
<PB N="173" REF="032200_0099_0FF184681E2A4E28"/>
the uneasy situation of the distressed; whatever be the motive, they are not only the most cha∣ritable of any other nation, but most judicious in distinguishing the properest objects of com∣passion.</P>
<P>In other countries, the giver is generally in∣fluenced by the immediate impulse of pity; his generosity is exerted as much to relieve his own uneasy sensations, as to comfort the object in distress: in <HI>England,</HI> benefactions are of a more general nature; some men of fortune and uni∣versal benevolence propose the proper objects; the wants and the merits of the petitioners are canvassed by the people; neither passion or pity find a place in the cool discussion; and charity is then only exerted, when it has received the approbation of reason.</P>

<HEAD>THE COMMON ENGLISH STRAN∣GERS TO URBANITY; WITH REMARKS ON THEIR PROWESS IN DIF∣FICULTIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE poor of every country are but little prone to treat each other with tenderness; their own miseries are too apt to engross all their pity; and, perhaps too, they give but little com∣miseration,
<PB N="174" REF="032200_0100_0FF18469B44DD0F8"/>
as they find but little from others. But, in <HI>England,</HI> the poor treat each other, upon every occasion, with more than savage animosity, and as if they were in a state of open war by nature. In <HI>China,</HI> if two porters should meet in a narrow street, they would lay down their burthens, make a thousand excuses to each other for the accidental interruption, and beg pardon on their knees. If two men of the same occu∣pation should meet here, they would first begin to scold, and, at last, to beat each other. One would think they had miseries enough resulting from penury and labour, not to increase them by ill-nature among themselves, and subjection to new penalties; but such considerations never weigh with them.</P>
<P>But to recompence this strange absurdity, they are, in the main, generous, brave, and enterprising. They feel the slightest injuries with a degree of ungoverned impatience, but resist the greatest ca∣lamities with surprising fortitude. Those mise∣ries under which any other people in the world would sink, they have often shewed they were capable of enduring: if accidently cast upon some desolate coast, their perseverance is beyond what any other nation is capable of sustaining; if imprisoned for crimes, their efforts to escape are greater than among others. The peculiar strength of their prisons, when compared to those else∣where, argues their hardiness; even the strongest

<HEAD>HAPPINESS EVER REPUGNANT TO OUR WISHES.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind is ever ingenious in making its own distress. The wandering beggar, who has none to protect, to feed, or to shelter him, fan∣cies complete happiness in labour and a full meal. Take him from rags and want, feed, clothe, and employ him, his wishes now rise one step above his station; he could be happy were he possessed of raiment, food, and ease. Suppose his wishes gratified even in these, his prospects widen as he ascends: he finds himself in affluence and tran∣quillity indeed; but indolence soon breeds anx∣iety, and he desires not only to be freed from pain, but to be possessed of pleasure: pleasure is granted him; and this but opens his soul to am∣bition; and ambition will be sure to taint his fu∣ture happiness, either with jealousy, disappoint∣ment, or fatigue.</P>
<P>But of all the arts of distress found out by man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his own torment, perhaps that of philosophic misery is most truly rediculous; a passion no where carried to so extravagant an excess as in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>England.</HI></NOTE> country where I now reside.

<HEAD>LEGISLATIVE POWER.</HEAD>
<P>IT were highly to be wished, that legislative power would direct the law rather to reforma∣tion than severity; that it would appear convin∣ced, that the work of eradicating crimes, is not by making punishments familiar, but formidable. Instead of our present prisons, which find or make men guilty, which inclose wretches for the com∣mission of one crime, and return them, if return∣ed alive, fitted for the perpetration of thousands, it were to be wished we had, as in other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> places of penitence and solitude, where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives of virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increas∣ing punishments, is the way to mend a state: nor can I avoid even questioning the validity of that right, which social combinations have assum∣ed,
<PB N="179" REF="032200_0102_0FF18470EBAEF3F0"/>
of capitally punishing offences of a slight nature. In cases of murder, their right is ob∣vious; as it is the duty of us all, from the law of self-defence, to cut off that man who has shewn a disregard for the life of another. A∣gainst such, all nature rises in arms; but it is not so against him who steals my property. Na∣tural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the horse he steals is as much his pro∣perty as mine. If then, I have any right, it must be from a compact made between us, that he who deprives the other of his horse shall die. But this is a false compact; because no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away; as it is not his own. And, next, the compact is inadequate, and would be set a side, even is a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience; since it is far better that two men should live, than that one man should ride. But a com∣pact that is false between two men, is equally so between an hundred, or an hundred thou∣sand; for as ten millions of circles can never make a square, so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest foundation to falsehood. It is thus that Reason speaks; and untutor∣ed Nature says the same thing. Savages, that are directed nearly by natural law alone, are very tender of the lives of each other; they seldom shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="032200_0103_0FF18473C4424560"/>
Our <HI>Saxon</HI> ancestors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commenceing governments that have the print of nature still strong upon them, scarce any crime is held capital.</P>
<P>It is among the citizens of a refined commu∣nity that penal laws, which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, seems to acquire the morose∣ness of age; and as if our possessions were be∣come dearer in proportion as they increased, as if the more enormous our wealth the more exten∣sive our fears, our possessions are paled with new-edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to scare every invader.</P>
<P>Whether is it from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiousness of our people, that this country should shew more convicts in a year, than half the dominions of Europe united? Per∣haps it is owing to both; for they mutually pro∣duce each other. When by indiscriminate penal laws a nation beholds the same punishment affix∣ed to dissimilar degrees of guilt, from perceiv∣ing no distinction in the penalty, the people are led to lose all sense of distinction in the crime, and this distinction is the bulwark of all morali∣ty: thus the multitude of laws produce new vices, and new vices call for fresh restraints.</P>
<P>It were to be wished, then, that power instead of contriving new laws to punish vice, instead
<PB N="181" REF="032200_0103_0FF18473C4424560"/>
of drawing hard the cords of society till a con∣vultion come to burst them, instead of cutting away wretches as useless, before we have tried their utility, instead of converting correction in∣to vengence, it were to be wished, that we tried the restrictive arts of government, and made law the protector, but not the tyrant of the peo∣ple. We should then find that creatures, whose souls are held as dross, only wanted the hand of a refiner; we should then find that wretches, now stuck up for long tortures, lest luxury should feel a momentary pang, might, if pro∣perly treated, serve to sinew the state in times of danger; that, as their faces are like ours, their hearts are so too; that few minds are so base as that perseverance cannot amend; that a man may see his last crime without dying for it; and that very little blood will serve to cement our security.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>DEATH is not that terrible thing which we suppose it to be; it is a spectre which frights us at; distance, but which disappears when we come to approach it more closely. Our ideas of its terrors are conceived in prejudice, and dressed up by fancy; we regard it not only as the great∣est misfortune, but also as an evil accompanied
<PB N="182" REF="032200_0104_0FF1847564C1BAA0"/>
with the most excruciating tortures: we have even increased our apprehensions, by reasoning on the extent of our sufferings. It must be dreadful, say some, since it is sufficient to se∣parate the soul from the body; it must be long, since our sufferings are proportioned to the suc∣cession of our ideas; and these being painful, must succeed each other with extreme rapidi∣ty. In this manner has false philosophy labour∣ed to augment the miseries of our nature, and to aggravate that period which nature has kindly covered with insensibility. Neither the mind, nor the body, can suffer these calamities; the mind is, at that time, mostly without ideas; and the body too much enfeebled to be capable of perceiving its pain. A very acute pain produces either death, or fainting, which is a state similar to death: the body can luffer but to a certain degree; if the torture becomes excessive, it de∣stroys itself; and the mind ceases to perceive, when the body can no longer endure.</P>
<P>In this manner excessive pain admits of no reflection; and, wherever there are are any signs of it, we may sure that the sufferings of the pa∣tient are no greater than what we ourselves may have remembered to endure.</P>
<P>But, in the article of death, we have many in∣stances in which the dying person has shewn that very reflection which pre-supposes an absence of the greatest pain; and, consequently, that
<PB N="183" REF="032200_0104_0FF1847564C1BAA0"/>
pang which ends life cannot even be so great as those which have preceded. Thus, when <HI>Charles</HI> XII. was shot at the siege of <HI>Frederick shall,</HI> he was seen to clap his hand on the hilt of his sword; and although the blow was great enough to terminate one of the boldest and bravest lives in the world, yet it was not painful enough to destroy reflection. He perceived himself attack∣ed; he reflected that he ought to defend himself, and his body obeyed the impulse of his mind, even in the last extremity. Thus it is the pre∣judice of persons in health, and not the body in pain, that makes us suffer from the approach of death: we have, all our lives, contracted an habit of making our excessive pleasures and pains; and nothing but repeated experience shews us how seldom the one can be suffered, or the other enjoyed, to the utmost. If there be any thing necessary to confirm what we have said concern∣ing the gradual cessation of life, or the insensible approaches of our end, nothing can more effc∣tually prove it than the uncertainty of the signs of death. If we consult what <HI>Winslow</HI> or <HI>Bru∣hier</HI> have said upon this subject, we shall be con∣vinced, that between life and death, the shade is so very undistinguishable, that even all the pow∣ers of art can scarcely determine where the one ends, and the other begins. The colour of the visage, the warmth of the body, the suppleness of the joints, are but uncertain signs of life still
<PB N="184" REF="032200_0105_0FF18479C492DA48"/>
subsisting; while, on the contrary, the paleness of the complexion, the coldness of the body, the stiffness of the extremities, the cessation of all motion, and the total insensibility of the parts, are but uncertain marks of death begun. In the same manner, also, with regard to the pulse, and the breathing, these motions are often so kept under, that it is impossible to perceive them. By approaching a lookingglass to the mouth of the person supposed to be dead, peo∣ple often expect to find whether he breathes or not; but this is a very uncertain experiment: the glass is frequently sullied by the vapour of the dead man's body; and often the person is still alive, although the glass is no way tarnish∣ed. In the same manner, neither burning, nor scarifying; neither noises in the ears, nor pun∣gent spirits applied to the nostrils, give certain signs of the discontinuance of life; and there are many instances of persons who have endured them all, and afterwards recovered, without any external assistance, to the astonishment of the spectators. How careful, therefore, should we be, before we commit those who are dearest to us to the grave, to be well assured of their de∣parture!—Experience, justice, humanity, all per∣suade us not to hasten the funerals of our friends, but to keep their bodies unburied, until we have certain signs of their real decease.</P>

<HEAD>THE STROLING PLAYER.</HEAD>
<P>I AM fond of amusement, in whatever com∣pany it is to be found; and wit, though dressed in rags, is ever pleasing to me. I went some days ago to take a walk in <HI>St. James' Park,</HI> about the hour in which company leave it to go to dinner. There were but few in the walks, and those who staid, seemed, by their looks, rather more willing to forget that they had an appetite than gain one. I sat down on one of the benches, at the other end of which was seat∣ed a man in very shabby cloaths.</P>
<P>We continued to groan, to hem, and to cough, as usual upon such occasions; and, at last, ven∣tured upon conversation. "I beg pardon, Sir," cried I, "but I think I have seen you before; your face is familiar to me." "Yes, Sir," re∣plied he, "I have a good familiar face, as my friends tell me. I am as well known in every town in <HI>England</HI> as the dromedary, or live cro∣codile.
<PB N="187" REF="032200_0106_0FF1847CC0CF7178"/>
You must understand, Sir, that I have been these sixteen years <HI>Merry Andrew</HI> to a pup∣petshow; last <HI>Bartholomew</HI> fair my master and I quarrelled, beat each other, and parted; he to fell his puppets to the pincushion-makers in <HI>Rosemary-lane,</HI> and I to starve in <HI>St. James' Park.</HI>"</P>
<P>"I am sorry, Sir, that a person of your ap∣pearance should labour under any difficulties." "O, Sir," returned he, "my appearance is very much at your service; but though I cannot boast of eating much, yet there are few that are merrier: if I had twenty thousand a year, I should be very merry; and, thank the Fates, though not worth a groat, I am very merry still. If I have three pence in my pocked, I never refuse to be my three halfpence; and, if I have no money, I never scorn to be treated by any that are kind enough to pay for my reckoning. What think you, Sir, of a steak and a tankard? You shall treat me now, and I will treat you again when I find you in the <HI>Park</HI> in love with eating, and without money to pay for a dinner."</P>
<P>As I never refused a small expence for the sake of a merry companion, we instantly adjourn∣ed to a neighbouring alehouse; and, in a few moments, had a frothing tankard, and a smoak∣ing steak, spread on the table before us. It is impossible to express how much the sight of such good cheer improved my companion's vivacity.
<PB N="188" REF="032200_0107_0FF1847F9914AF50"/>
"I like this dinner, Sir," says he, "for three reasons: first, because I am naturally fond of beef; secondly, because I am hungry; and, third∣ly and lastly, because I get it for nothing: no meat eats so sweet as that for which we do not pay."</P>
<P>He therefore now fell to, and his appetite seemed to correspond with his inclination. Af∣ter dinner was over, he observed that the steak was tough; "and yet, Sir," returns he, "bad as it was, it seemed a rump-steak to me. O the delights of poverty and a good appetite! We beggars are the very fondlings of Nature: the rich she treats like an errant step-mother; they are pleased with nothing: cut a steak from what part you will and it is insupportably tough; dress it up with pickles,—even pickles cannot procure them an appetite. But the whole crea∣tion is filled with good things for the beggar; <HI>Calvert'</HI>s butt out-tastes champaigne, and <HI>Sedge∣ley'</HI>s home-brewed excels tokay. Joy, joy, my blood! though our estates lie no where, we have fortunes wherever we go. If an inunda∣tion sweeps away half the grounds of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> I am content; I have no lands there: if the stocks sink, that gives me no uneasiness; I am no <HI>Jew.</HI>"</P>
<P>The fellow's vivacity, joined to his poverty, I own, raised my curiosity to know something of his life and circumstances; and I intreated,
<PB N="189" REF="032200_0107_0FF1847F9914AF50"/>
that he would indulge my desire.—"That I will, Sir," said he, "and welcome; only let us drink to prevent our sleeping; let us have another tankard while we are awake; let us have another tankard; for, ah! how charming a tank∣ard looks when full!</P>
<P>"You must know, then, that I am very well descended: my ancestors have made some noise in the world; for my mother cried oysters, and my father beat a drum: I am told we have even had some trumpeters in our family. Many a nobleman cannot shew so respectful a genealogy: but that is neither here nor there. As I was their only child, my father designed to breed me up to his own employment, which was that of drummer to a puppet-shew. Thus the whole employment of my younger years was that of interpreter to <HI>Punch</HI> and King <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his glory. But, though my father was very fond of instructing me in beating all the marches and points of war, I made no very great progress, because I naturally had no ear for music; so, at the age of fifteen, I went and listed for a soldier. As I had ever hated beating a drum, so I soon found that I disliked carrying a musket also; neither the one trade nor the other were to my taste, for I was by nature fond of being a gentle∣man: besides, I was obliged to obey my captain; he has his will, I have mine, and you have yours: now I very reasonably concluded, that
<PB N="190" REF="032200_0108_0FF184814A0EF768"/>
it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than another's.</P>
<P>"The life of a soldier soon therefore gave me the spleen: I asked leave to quit the service; but, as I was tall and strong, my captain thank∣ed me for my kind intention, and said, because he had a regard for me, we should not part. I wrote to my father a very dismal penitent letter, and desired that he would raise money to pay for my discharge; but the good man was as fond of drinking as I was (Sir, my service to you), and those who are fond of drinking never pay for other people's discharges: in short, he never answered my letter. What could be done? If I have not money, said I to myself, to pay for my discharge, I must find an equivalent some other way; and that must be by running away. I deserted, and that answered my purpose every bit as well as if I had bought my discharge.</P>
<P>"Well, I was now fairly rid of my military employment: I sold my soldier's clothes, bought worse, and, in order not to be overtaken, took the most unfrequented roads possible. One even∣ing, as I was entering a village, I perceived a man, whom I afterwards found to be the curate of the parish, thrown from his horse in a miry road, and almost smothered in the mud. He desired my assistance; I gave it, and drew him out with some difficulty. He thanked me for my trouble, and was going off, but I followed
<PB N="191" REF="032200_0108_0FF184814A0EF768"/>
him home, for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door. The curate asked an hundred questions; as, whose son I was; from whence I came; and whether I would be faithful? I answered him greatly to his satisfac∣tion; and gave myself one of the best characters in the world for sobriety (Sir, I have the honour of drinking your health), discretion, and fide∣lity. To make a long story short, he wanted a servant, and hired me. With him I lived but two months; we did not much like each other: I was fond of eating, and he gave me but little to eat; I loved a pretty girl, and the old woman, my fellow-servant, was ill-natured and ugly. As they endeavoured to starve me between them, I made a pious resolution to prevent their commit∣ting murder: I stole the eggs as soon as they were laid; I emptied every unfinished bottle that I could lay my hands on; whatever eatable came in my way was sure to disappear: in short, they found I would not do; so I was discharged one morning, and paid three shillings and six∣pence for two months wages.</P>
<P>"While my money was getting ready, I em∣ployed myself in making preparations for my departure: two hens were hatching in an out∣house; I went and habitually took the eggs, and, not to separate the parents from the children, I lodged hens and all in my knapsack. After this piece of frugality, I returned to receive my mo∣ney;
<PB N="192" REF="032200_0109_0FF184844ECB2BA0"/>
and, with my knapsack on my back, and a staff in my hand, I bid adieu, with tears in my eyes, to my old benefactor. I had not gone far from the house, when I heard behind me the cry of Stop thief! but this only increased my dispatch; it would have been foolish to stop, as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me. But hold—I think I passed those two months at the curate's without drinking. Come, the times are dry; and may this be my poison, if ever I spent two more pious, stupid months in all my life!</P>
<P>"Well, after travelling some days, whom should I light upon but a company of strolling players? The moment I saw them at a distance, my heart warmed to them; I had a sort of na∣tural love for every thing of the vagabond order; they were employed in settling their baggage, which had been overturned in a narrow way. I offered my assistance, which they excepted; and we soon became so well acquainted, that they took me as a servant. This was a para∣dise to me; they sung, danced, drank, eat, and travelled, all at the same time. By the blood of the <HI>Mirabels,</HI> I thought I had never lived till then; I grew as merry as a grig, and laugh∣ed at every word that was spoken. They liked me as much as I liked them; I was a very good figure as you see; and, though I was poor, I was not modest.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="032200_0109_0FF184844ECB2BA0"/>
"I love a straggling life above all things in the world; sometimes good, sometimes bad; to be warm to-day, and cold to-morrow; to eat when one can get it, and drink when (the tank∣ard is out) it stands before me. We arrived that evening at <HI>Tenderten,</HI> and took a large room at the <HI>Greyhound;</HI> where we resolved to exhibit <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> with the funeral procession, the grave and the garden scene. <HI>Romeo</HI> was to be performed by a gentleman from the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane; Juliet</HI> by a lady who never appeared on any stage before; and I was to snuff the candles: all excellent in our way. We had figures enough, but the difficulty was to dress them. The same coat that served <HI>Romeo</HI> turned with the blue lining outwards, served for his friend <HI>Mercutio:</HI> a large piece of crape sufficed at once for <HI>Juliet'</HI>s petticoat and pall: a pestle and morter, from a neighbouring apothecary's answered all the purposes of a bell; and our land∣lord's own family, wrapped in white sheets serv∣ed to sill up the procession. In short, there were but three figures among us that might be said to be dressed with any propriety: I mean the nurse, the straved apothecary, and myself. Our perfor∣mance gave universal satisfaction: the whole au∣dience were enchanted with our powers; and <HI>Tenterden</HI> is a town of taste.</P>
<P>There is one rule by which a strolling-player may be ever secure of success; that is, in our the∣atrical
<PB N="194" REF="032200_0110_0FF1848872282A08"/>
way of expressing it, to make a great deal of the character. To speak and act as in com∣mon life, is not playing; nor is it what people come to see: natural speaking, like sweet wine, runs glibly over the palate, and scarce leaves any taste behind it: but being high in a part re∣sembles vinegar, which grates upon the taste, and one feels it while he is drinking. To please the town or country, the way is, to cry, wring, cringe into attitudes, mark the emphasis, slap the pockets, and labour like one in the falling sickness; that is the way to work for applause, that is the way to gain it.</P>
<P>"As we received much reputation for our skill on this first exhibition, it was but natural for me to ascribe part of the success to myself. I snuffed the candles, and, let me tell you, that, without a candle-snuffer, the piece would lose half its embellishments. In this manner we con∣tinued a fortnight, and drew tolerable houses; but the evening before our intended departure, we gave out our very best piece, in which all our strength was to be exerted. We had great ex∣pectations from this, and even doubled our pri∣ces; when, behold, one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever. This was a stroke like thunder to our little company: they were resolv∣ed to go, in a body, to scold the man for fall∣ing sick at so inconvenient a time, and that, too, of a disorder that threatened to be expensive: I
<PB N="195" REF="032200_0110_0FF1848872282A08"/>
seized the moment, and offered to act the part myself in his stead. The case was desperate; they accepted my offer; and I accordingly sat down, with the part in my hand and a tankard before be (Sir, your health), and studied the character, which was to be rehearsed the next day, and played soon after.</P>
<P>"I found my memory excessively helped by drinking; I learned my part with astonishing ra∣pidity, and bid adieu to snuffing candles ever after. I found that nature had designed me for more noble employments, and I was resolved to take her when in the humour. We got together in order to rehearse, and I informed my compa∣nions, masters now no longer, of the surprising change I felt within me. Let the sick man, said I, be under no uneasiness to get well again; I'll fill his place to universal satisfaction; he may even die if he thinks proper; I'll engage that he shall never be missed. I rehearsed before them, strutted, ranted and received ap∣plause. They soon gave out that a new actor of eminence was to appear, and immediately all the genteel places were bespoke. Before I ascend∣ed the stage however, I concluded within my∣self, that, as I brought money to the house, I ought to have my share in the profits. Gentlemen said I, addressing our company, I don't pretend to direct you; far be it from me to treat you with so much ingratitude: you have published
<PB N="196" REF="032200_0111_0FF1848CA8EF89B8"/>
my name in the bills, with the utmost good-na∣ture; and, as affairs stand, cannot act without me; so, gentlemen, to shew you my gratitude, I expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you, otherwise I declare off; I'll brandish my snuffers, and clip candles as usual. This was a very disagreeable propposal; but they found that it was impossible to refuse it; it was irresistible, it was adamant: they consented, and I went on in king <HI>Bajazet.</HI> My frowning brows, bound with a stocking stuffed into a turban, while on my captiv'd arms I brandished a jack-chain. Nature seemed to have fitted me for the part; I was tall, and had a loud voice; my ve∣ry entrance excited universal applause; I looked round on the audience with a smile, and made a most low and graceful bow, for that is the rule among us. As it was a very passionate part, I invigorated my spirits with three full glasses (the tankard is almost out) of brandy. By <HI>Alla!</HI> it is almost inconceivable how I went through it; <HI>Tamerlane</HI> was but a fool to me; though he was sometimes loud enough too, yet I was still louder than he: but then, besides, I had attitudes in abundance: in general I kept my arms folded up thus, upon the pit of my stomach; it is the way at <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> and has always a fine effect. The tankard would sink to the bottom before I could get through the whole of my merits: in short, I came off like
<PB N="197" REF="032200_0111_0FF1848CA8EF89B8"/>
a prodigy; and such was my success, that I could ravish the laurels even from a surloin of beef. The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me after the play was over, to compliment me upon my success; one prais∣ed my voice, another my person: Upon my word, says the 'squire's lady, he will make one of the finest actors in <HI>Europe;</HI> I say it, and I think I am something of a judge.—Praise in the beginning is agreeable enough, and we re∣ceive it as a favour; but, when it comes in great quantities, we regard it only as a debt, which nothing but our merit could extort: in∣stead of thanking them, I internally applauded myself. We were desired to give our piece a second time; we obeyed, and I was applauded even more than before.</P>
<P>"At last we left the town, in order to be at a horse-race at some distance from thence. I shall never think of <HI>Tenterden</HI> without tears of gratitude and respect. The ladies and gentlemen there, take my word for it, are very good judges of plays and actors. Come, let us drink their healths, if you please, Sir. We quitted the town, I say; and there was a wide difference between my coming in and going out: I enter∣ed the town a candle-snuffer, and quitted it an hero!—Such is the world! little to-day, and great to-morrow. I could say a great deal more upon that subject; something truly sublime upon
<PB N="198" REF="032200_0112_0FF1848E45025170"/>
the ups and downs of fortune; but it would give us both the spleen, and so I shall pass it over.</P>
<P>"The races were ended before we arrived at the next town, which was no small disappoint∣ment to our company; however, we were re∣solved to take all we could get. I played capital characters there too, and came off with my usual brilliancy. I sincerely believe I should have been the first actor of <HI>Europe,</HI> had my growing merit been properly cultivated; but there came an unkindly frost which nipped me in the bud, and levelled me once more down to the common standard of humanity I played Sir <HI>Harry Wildair;</HI> all the country ladies were charmed: if I but drew out my snuff-box, the whole house was in a roar of rapture; when I exercised my cudgel, I thought they would have fallen into convulsions.</P>
<P>There was here a lady who had received an education of nine months in <HI>London;</HI> and this gave her pretensions to taste, which rendered her the indisputable mistress of the ceremonies wherever she came. She was informed of my merits; every body praised me; yet she refused at first going to see me perform: she could not conceive, she said, any thing but stuff from a stroller; talked something in praise of <HI>Garrick,</HI> and amazed the ladies with her skill in enunci∣ations, tones, and cadences. She was at last, however, prevailed upon to go; and it was pri∣vately
<PB N="199" REF="032200_0112_0FF1848E45025170"/>
intimated to me what a judge was to be present at my next exhibition: however, no way intimidated, I came on in Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> one hand stuck in my breeches, and the other in my bo∣som, as usual at <HI>Drury-Lane;</HI> but, instead of looking at me, I perceived the whole audience had their eyes turned upon the lady who had been nine months in <HI>London;</HI> from her they ex∣pected the decision which was to secure the gene∣ral's truncheon in my hand, or sink me down into a theatrical letter-carrier. I opened my snuff∣box, took snuff—the lady was solemn, and so were the rest. I broke the cudgel on alderman Smuggler's back—still gloomy, melancholy all; the lady groaned and shrugged her shoulders. I attempted, by laughing myself, to excite at least a smile;—but the devil a cheek could I perceive wrinkled into sympathy: I found it would not do; all my good-humour now became forced; my laughter was converted into hysteric grinning; and, while I pretened spirits my eye shewed the agony of my heart. In short, the lady came with an intention to be displeased, and displeased she was; my fame expired; I am here, and—(the tankard is no more!")</P>

When∣ever, therefore, we find any apparent defects in the earth, which we are about to consider, instead of attempting to reason ourselves into an opinion that they are beautiful, it will be wise to say, that we do not behold them at the proper point of distance, and that our eye is laid too close to the objects to take in the regularity of their connexion.

<HEAD>ASEM, THE MAN-HATER.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE <HI>Tauris</HI> lifts its head above the storm and presents nothing to the sight of the distant traveller, but a prospect of nodding rocks, falling torrents, and all the variety of tremendous na∣ture; on the bleak bosom of this frightful moun∣tain, secluded from society, and detesting the ways of men, lived <HI>Asem</HI> the Man-hater.</P>
<P><HI>Asem</HI> had spent his youth with men, had shar∣ed in their amusements, and had been taught to love his fellow-creatures with the most ardent affection: but, from the tenderness of his dispo∣sition, he exausted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the distressed. The petitioner never sued in vain; the weary traveller never pass∣ed his door: he only desisted from doing good when he had no longer the power of relieving.</P>
<P>From a fortune thus spent in benevolence, he expected a grateful return from those he had for∣merely

relieved; and made his application with confidence of redress. The ungrateful world soon grew weary of his importunity; for pity is but a short-lived passion. He soon, therefore, began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before beheld them: he perceived a thousand vices he had never be∣fore suspected to exist: wherever he turned, ingratitude, dissimulation, and treachery, contri∣buted to increase his detestation of them. Re∣solved therefore to continue no longer in a world which he hated, and which repaid his detesta∣tion with contempt, he retired to this region of sterility, in order to brood over his resentment in solitude, and converse with the only honest heart he knew; namely, his own.</P>
<P>A cave was his only shelter from the incle∣mency of the weather; fruits gathered with difficulty from the mountain's side, his only food; and his drink was fetched with danger and toil from the headlong torrent.

<P>At the foot of the mountain, an extensive lake displayed its glassy bosom; reflecting, on its broad surface, the impending horrors of the mountain. To this capacious mirror he would sometimes descend, and, reclining on its steep

bank, cast an eager look on the smooth expanse that lay before him. "How beautiful," he often cried, "is nature! how lovely, even in her wild∣est scenes! How finely contrasted is the level plain that lies beneath me, with yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> awful pile that hides its tremendous head in clouds! But the beauty of these scenes is no way comparable with their utility; from hence an hundred rivers are supplied, which distribute health and verdure to the various countries through which they flow. Every part of the universe is beautiful, just, and wise, but man: vile man is a solecism in nature; the only monster in the creation. Tempests and whirlwinds have their use; but vicious, ungrateful man is a blot in the fair page of universal beauty. Why was I born of that detested species, whose vices are almost a reproach to the wisdom of the divine Creator! Were men intirely free from vice, all would be uniformity, harmony, and order. A world of moral rectitude should be the result of a prefectly moral agent. Why, why then, O <HI>Alla!</HI> must I be thus confined in darkness, doubt and despair?"</P>
<P>Just as he uttered the word Despair, he was going to plunge into a lake beneath him, at once to satisfy his doubts, and put a period to his anxiety; when he perceived a most majestic being walking on the surface of the water, and approaching the bank on which he stood. So
<PB N="205" REF="032200_0115_0FF18497456FDC68"/>
unexpected an object at once checked his pur∣pose; he stopped, contemplated, and fancied he saw something awful and divine in his aspect.</P>
<P>"Son of Adam," cried the Genius, "stop thy rash purpose; the Father of the Faithful has seen thy justice, thy integrity, thy miseries, and hath sent me to afford and administer relief. Give me thine hand, and follow, without trem∣bling, wherever I shall lead; in me behold the Genius of Conviction, kept by the great pro∣phet, to turn from their errors those who go astray, not from curiosity, but a rectitude of in∣tention. Follow me, and be wise."</P>
<P><HI>Asem</HI> immediately descended upon the lake, and his guide conducted him along the surface of the water; 'till, coming near the centre of the lake, they both began to sink; the waters closed over their heads; they descended several hundred fathoms, 'till <HI>Asem,</HI> just ready to give up his life as inevitably lost, found himself with his celestial guide in another world, at the bot∣tom of the waters, where human foot had never trod before. His astonishment was beyond de∣scription, when he saw a sun like that he had left, a serene sky over his head, and blooming verdure under his feet.</P>
<P>"I plainly perceive your amazement," said the Genius; "but suspend it for a while. This world was formed by <HI>Alla,</HI> at the request, and under the inspection, of our great prophet,
<PB N="206" REF="032200_0116_0FF18498DCACBE78"/>
who once entertained the same doubts while filled your mind when I found you, and from the consequence of which you were so lately rescued. The rational inhabitants of this world are formed agreeable to your own ideas; they are obsolutely without vice. In other respects it resembles your earth, but differs from it in being wholly inhabited by men who never do wrong. If you find this world more agreeable than that you so lately left, you have free permission to spend the remainder of your days in it; but per∣mit me, for some time, to attend you, that I may silence your doubts, and make you better acquainted with your company and your new habitation."</P>
<P>"A world without vice! Rational beings without immorality!" cried <HI>Asem,</HI> in a rapture; "I thank thee, O <HI>Alla,</HI> who hast at length heard my petitions; this, this indeed will produce hap∣piness, extasy, and ease. O for an immortality! to spend it among men who are incapable of ingratitude, injustice, fraud, violence, and a thousand other crimes, that render society mi∣serable."</P>
<P>"Cease thine acclamations," replied the Ge∣nius. "Look around thee; reflect on every ob∣ject and action before us, and communicate to me the result of thine observations. Lead wherever you think proper; I shall be your attendant and instructor." <HI>Asem</HI> and his compa∣nion
<PB N="207" REF="032200_0116_0FF18498DCACBE78"/>
travelled on in silence for some time, the former being entirely lost in astonishment; but, at last, recovering his former serenity, he could not help observing, that the face of the country bore a very near resemblance to that he had left, except that this subterranean world still seemed to retain its primaeval wildness.</P>
<P>"Here," cried <HI>Asem,</HI> "I perceive animals of prey, and others that seem only designed for their subsistance; it is the very same in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over our heads. But, had I been permitted to instruct our prophet, I would have removed this defect, and formed no voracious or destructive animals, which only prey on the other parts of the creation." "Your tenderness for inferior animals is, I find, remarkable," said the Genius, smiling. But with regard to meaner creatures, this world exactly resembles the other; and, in∣deed, for obvious reasons: for the earth can sup∣port a more considerable number of animals, by their thus becoming food for each other than if they had lived entirely on the vegetable pro∣ductions; so that animals of different natures, thus formed, instead of lessening their multi∣tude, subsist in the greatest number possible. But let us hasten on to the inhabited country before us, and see what that offers for instruc∣tion.</P>
<P>They soon gained the utmost verge of the forest, and entered the country inhabited by men
<PB N="208" REF="032200_0117_0FF1849BDFD0F948"/>
without vice; and <HI>Asem</HI> anticipated, in idea, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> delight he hoped to experience in such an innocent society. But they had scarce left the confines of the wood, when they beheld one or the inhabitants flying with hasty steps, and terror in his countenance, from an army of squirrels that closely pursued him. "Heavens!" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Asem,</HI> "why does he fly? What can he fear from animals so contemptible?" He had scarce spoke, when he perceived two dogs pur∣suing another of the human species, who, with equal terror and haste, attempted to avoid them. "This," cried <HI>Asem</HI> to his guide, "is truly surprising; nor can I conceive the reason for so strange an action." "Every species of ani∣mals," replied the Genius, "has of late grown very powerful in this country; for the inhabi∣tants, at first, thinking it unjust to use either fraud or force in destroying them, they have insensibly increased, and now frequently ravage their harmless frontiers." "But they should have been destroyed," cried <HI>Asem;</HI> "you see the consequence of such neglect." "Where is then that tenderness you so lately expressed for subordinate animals?" replied the Genius, smiling: "you seem to have forgot that branch of justice." "I must acknowledge my mistake," returned <HI>Asem;</HI> "I am now convinced that we must be guilty of tyranny and injustice to the brute creation, if we would enjoy the world our∣selves.
<PB N="209" REF="032200_0117_0FF1849BDFD0F948"/>
But let us no longer observe the duty, of men to these irrational creatures, but survey their connexions with one another."</P>
<P>As they walked further up the country, the more he was surprised to see no vestiges of hand∣some houses, no cities, nor any mark of elegant design. His conductor perceiving his surprise, observed, That the inhabitants of this new world were perfectly content with their ancient sim∣plicity; each had an house, which though home∣ly, was sufficient to lodge his little family; they were too good to build houses, which would only increase their own pride, and the envy of the spectator; what they built was for convenience, not for shew. "At least, then," said <HI>Asem,</HI> "they have neither architects, pain∣ters, or statuaries, in their society; but these are idle arts and may be spared. However, be∣fore I spend much more time here, you should have my thanks for introducing me into the society of some of their wisest men: there is scarce any pleasure to me equal to a refined conversation; there is nothing of which I am so enamoured as wisdom." "Wisdom!" re∣plied his instuctor, "how ridiculous! We have no wisdom here, for we have no occasion for it; true wisdom is only a knowledge of our own duty, and the duty of others to us: but of what use is such wisdom here? Each intui∣tively performs what is right in himself, and
<PB N="210" REF="032200_0118_0FF1849EF4024908"/>
expects the same from others. If, by wisdom, you should mean vain curiosity and empty spe∣culation, as such pleasures have their origin in vanity, luxury, or avarice, we are too good to pursue them." "All this may be right," says <HI>Asem;</HI> "but, methinks, I observe a solitary disposition prevail among the people; each fa∣mily keeps separately within their own precincts, without society or without intercourse." "That indeed, is true," replied the other; "here is no established society; nor should there be any: all societies are made either through fear or friendship; the people we are among, are too good to fear each other; and there are no mo∣tives to private friendship, where all are equally meritorious." "Well, then," said the sceptic, "as I am to spend my time here, if I am to have neither the polite arts, nor wisdom, nor friendship, in such a world, I should be glad, at least, of an easy companion, who may tell me his thoughts, and to whom I may commu∣nicate mine." "And to what purpose should either do this?" says the Genius: "flattery or curiosity are vicious motives, and never al∣lowed here; and wisdom is out of the ques∣tion."</P>
<P>"Still, however," said <HI>Asem,</HI> "the inhabi∣tants must be happy; each is contented with his own possessions, nor avariciously endeavours to heap up more than is necessary for his own
<PB N="211" REF="032200_0118_0FF1849EF4024908"/>
subsistence; each has, therefore, leisure to pity those that stand in need of his compassion." He had scarce spoken, when his ears were as∣saulted with the lamentations of a wretch who sat by the way-side, and, in the most deplora∣ble distress, seemed gently to murmur at his own misery. <HI>Asem</HI> immediately ran to his re∣lief, and found him in the last stage of a con∣sumption. "Strange," cried the son of <HI>Adam,</HI> "that men who are free from vice should thus suffer so much misery without relief!" "Be not surprised," said the wretch who was dying; "would it not be the utmost injustice for beings, who have only just sufficient to support them∣selves, and are content with a bare subsistance, to take it from their own mouths to put it into mine? They never are possessed of a single meal more than is necessary; and what is barely necessary, cannot be dispensed with." "They should have been supplied with more than is necessary," cried <HI>Asem;</HI> "and yet I contradict my own opinion but a moment before: all is doubt, perplexity, and confusion. Even the want of ingratitude is no virtue here, since they never received a favour. They have, how∣ever, another excellence, yet behind; the love of their country is still, I hope, one of their darling virtues." "Peace, <HI>Asem!</HI>" replied the guardian, with a countenance not less severe than beautiful, "nor forfeit all thy pretensions
<PB N="212" REF="032200_0119_0FF184A47300EE38"/>
to wisdom; the same selfish motives by which we prefer our own interest to that of others, induce us to regard our country preferable to that of another. Nothing less than universal benevolence is free from vice, and that you see is practised here." "Strange!" cries the dis∣appointed pilgrim, in an agony of distress; "what sort of a world am I now introduced to? There is scarce a single virtue, but that of temperance, which they practise; and in that they are no way superior to the very brute creation. There is scarce an amusement which they en∣joy; fortitude, liberality, friendship, wisdom, conversation, and love of country, all are virtues entirely unknown here; thus it seems, that to be unacquainted with vice, is not to know virtue. Take me, O my Genius, back to that very world which I have despised: a world which has <HI>Alla</HI> for its contriver, is much more wisely formed than that which has been projected by <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Ingratitude, contempt, and hatred I can now suffer, for perhaps I have deserved them. When I arraigned the wisdom of Pro∣vidence, I only shewed my own ignorance; henceforth let me keep from vice myself, and pity it in others."</P>
<P>He had scarce ended, when the Genius, as∣suming an air of terrible complacency, called all his thunders around him, and vanished in a whirlwind. <HI>Asem,</HI> astonished at the terror of
<PB N="213" REF="032200_0119_0FF184A47300EE38"/>
the scene, looked for his imaginary world; when casting his eyes around, he perceived himself, in the very situation, and in the very place, where he first began to repine and dispair; his right foot had been just advanced to take the fatal plunge, nor had it been yet withdrawn; so instantly did Providence strike the truths just imprinted on his soul. He now departed from the water-side in traquillity, and, leaving his horrid mansion, travelled to <HI>Segestan,</HI> his native city; where he diligently applied himself to commerce, and put in practice that wisdom he had learned in solitude. The frugality of a few years soon produced oppulence; the number of his domestics increased; his friends came to him from every part of the city; nor did he re∣ceive them with disdain; and a youth of misery was concluded with an old-age of elegance, affluence, and ease.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF ALCANDER AND SEPTIMIUS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TAKEN FROM A BYZANTINE HISTORIAN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ATHENS,</HI> long after the decline of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> empire, still continued the seat of learning, politeness, and wisdom. <HI>Theodoric,</HI> the <HI>Ostrogoth.</HI> repaired the schools which barbarity was suffer∣ing to fall into decay, and continued those pensions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized.</P>
<P>In this city, and about this period, <HI>Alcander</HI> and <HI>Septimius</HI> were fellow students together; the one, the most subtle reasoner of all the <HI>Lyceum;</HI> the other, the most eloquent speaker in the academic grove. Mutual admiration soon begot a friendship. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they were natives of the two most celebrated cities in the world; for <HI>Alcander</HI> was of <HI>Athens, Septimius</HI> came from <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>In this state of harmony they lived for some time together, when <HI>Alcander,</HI> after passing the first part of his youth in the indolence of philo∣sophy, thought at length of entering into the busy world; and, as a step previous to this, placed his affections on <HI>Hypatia,</HI> a lady of exqui∣site beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were per∣formed;
<PB N="219" REF="032200_0122_0FF184AACCCF6758"/>
and nothing now remained, but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom.</P>
<P><HI>Alcander'</HI>s exultation in his own happiness, or being unable to enjoy any satisfaction without making his friend <HI>Septimius</HI> a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce <HI>Hypatia</HI> to his fellow-stu∣dent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found himself equally happy in friend∣ship and love. But this was an interview fatal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the future peace of both; for <HI>Septimius</HI> no sooner saw her, but he was smitten with an involuntary passion; and, though he used every effort to suppress desires at once so imprudent and unjust, the emotions of his mind in a short time became so strong, that they brought on a fever, which the physicians judged incu∣rable.</P>
<P>During this illness, <HI>Alcander</HI> watched him with all the anxiety of fondness, and brought his mistress to join in those amiable offices of friendship. The sagacity of the physicians, by these means, soon discovered that the cause of their patient's disorder was love; and <HI>Alcander,</HI> being apprised of their discovery, at length ex∣torted a confession from the reluctant dying lover.</P>
<P>It would but delay the narrative to describe the conflict between love and friendship in the breast of <HI>Alcander</HI> on this occosion; it is enough
<PB N="220" REF="032200_0123_0FF184AEE16149C0"/>
to say, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> were at that time ar∣rived at such refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to excess. In short, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms to the young <HI>Roman.</HI> They were married privately by his connivance, and this unlooked-for change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the constitution of the now happy <HI>Septimius.</HI> In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and set out with his fair partner for <HI>Rome.</HI> Here, by an exertion of those talents which he was so eminently pos∣sessed of, <HI>Septimius,</HI> in a few years, arrived at the highest dignities of the state, and was con∣stituted the city judge, or praetor.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Alcander</HI> not only felt the pain of being separated from his friend and his mistress, but a persecution was also commenced against him, by the relations of <HI>Hypatia,</HI> for hav∣ing basely given up his bride, as was suggested, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to withstand the in∣fluence of a powerful party. He was cast, and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to raise so large a sum at the time appointed, his possessions were confiscated, he himself was stripped of the habit of freedom, exposed as a slave in the market-place, and sold to the highest bidder.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="032200_0123_0FF184AEE16149C0"/>
A merehant of <HI>Thrace</HI> becoming his purcha∣ser, <HI>Alcander,</HI> with some other companions of distress, was carried into that region of desolation and sterility. His stated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious master, and his success in hunting was all that was allowed him to supply his precarious subsistance. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of season served but to aggravate his unsheltered distress. After some years of bondage, however, an opportunity of escaping offered; he embraced it with ardour; so that, travelling by night, and lodging in ca∣verns by day, to shorten a long story, he at last arrived in <HI>Rome.</HI> The same day on which <HI>Alcander</HI> arrived, <HI>Septimius</HI> sat administering jus∣tice in the forum, whether our wanderer came, expecting to be instantly known, and publicly acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he stood the whole day amongst the crowd, watch∣ing the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of; but he was so much altered by a long succession of hardships, that he con∣tinued unnoticed among the rest; and, in the evening, when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repulsed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night coming on, he now found himself un∣der a necessity of seeking a place to lie in, and
<PB N="222" REF="032200_0124_0FF184B078F709D0"/>
yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated and in rags, as he was, none of the citizens would harbour so much wretchedness; and sleep∣ing in the streets might be attended with inter∣ruption or danger: in short, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the usual retreat of guilt, poverty, and despair. In this mansion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his mise∣ries for a while in sleep; and found, on his flinty couch, more ease than beds of down can supply to the guilty.</P>
<P>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their retreat; but, happening to disagree about the division of their plunder, one of them stabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In these circumstances he was found next morning, dead, at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enquiry, an alarm was spread; the cave was examined; and <HI>Alcander</HI> being found, was immediately ap∣prehended, and accused of robbery and mur∣der. The circumstances against him were strong, and the wretchedness of his appearance con∣firmed suspicion. Misfortune and he were now so long acquainted, that he at last became re∣gardless of life. He detested a world where he had found only ingratitude, falsehood, and cru∣elty; he was determined to make no defence;
<PB N="223" REF="032200_0124_0FF184B078F709D0"/>
and thus, lowering with resolution, he was dragg∣ed, bound with cords, before the tribunal of <HI>Sep∣timius.</HI> As the proofs were positive against him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a most cruel and ignomonious death, when the attention of the multitude was soon divided by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehended selling his plun∣der, and struck with a panic, had confessed his crime. He was brought bound to the same tribunal, and acquitted every other person of any partnership in his guilt. <HI>Alcander'</HI>s innocence therefore appeared, but the sullen rashness of his conduct remained a wonder to the surround∣ing multitude; but their astonishment was still further increased, when they saw their judge start from his tribunal to embrace the supposed criminal. <HI>Septimius</HI> recollected his friend and former benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy. Need the sequel be related? <HI>Alcander</HI> was acquitted; shared the friendship and honours of the principal citizens of <HI>Rome;</HI> lived afterwards in happiness and case; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, That no circumstances are so desperate, which Providence may not relieve.</P>

<HEAD>PLEASURES OF RURAL RETIRE∣MENT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I reflect on the unambitious retire∣ment in which I passed the earlier part of my life in the country, I cannot avoid feeling some pain in thinking that those happy days are never to return. In that retreat, all nature seemed capable of affording pleasure: I then made no refinements on happiness, but could be pleased with the most aukward efforts of rustic mirth; thought cross-purposes the highest stretch of hu∣man wit, and questions and commands the most rational way of spending the evening. Happy could so charming an illusion still continue! I find that age and knowledge only contribute to sour our dispositions. My present enjoyments may be more refined, but they are infinitely less pleasing. The pleasure the best actors gives, can no way compare to that I have received from a country wag who imitated a Quaker's sermon. The music of the finest singer is dissonance to what I felt when our old dairy-maid sung me into tears with <HI>Johnny Armstrong'</HI>s Last Good Night, or the cruelty of <HI>Barbara Allen.</HI></P>
<P>Writers of every age have endeavoured to shew that pleasure is in us, and not in the ob∣jects offered for our amusement. If the soul be happily disposed, every thing becomes capable
<PB N="226" REF="032200_0126_0FF184B679D651F8"/>
of affording entertainment; and distress will almost want a name. Every occurrence passes in review like the figures of a procession; some may be aukward, others ill-dressed; but none but a fool is for this enraged with the master of the ceremony.</P>
<P>I remember to have once seen a slave in a fortification in <HI>Flanders,</HI> who appeared no way touched with his situation. He was maimed, deformed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till night-fall; and con∣demned to this for life: yet, with all these circumstances of apparent wretchedness, he sang, would have danced but that he wanted a leg, and appeared the merriest, happiest man of all the garrison. What a practical philosopher was here! An happy constitution supplied philoso∣phy; and, though seemingly destitute of wisdom, he was really wise. No reading or study had contributed to disenchant the fairy-land around him: every thing furnished him with an oppor∣tunity of mirth; and, though some thought him, from his insensibility, a fool, he was such an ideot as philosophers should wish to imitate; for all philosophy is only forcing the trade of happiness, when nature seems to have denied the means.</P>
<P>They who, like our slave, can place them∣selves on that side of the world in which every thing appears in a pleasing light, will find some∣thing
<PB N="227" REF="032200_0126_0FF184B679D651F8"/>
in every occurrence to excite their good∣humour. The most calamitous events, either to themselves or others, can bring no new afflic∣tion; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All the bustle of heroism, or the rants of ambition, serve only to heighten the absurdity of the scene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in short, as little anguish at their own distress, or the complaints of others, as the undertaker though dressed in black, feels sorrow at a fu∣neral.</P>
<P>Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Cardinal <HI>de Retz</HI> possessed this happiness of tem∣per in the highest degree. As he was a man of gallantry, and despised all that wore the pe∣dantic appearance of philosophy, wherever plea∣sure was to be sold, he was generally foremost to raise the auction. Being an universal admirer of the fair sex, when he found one lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another, from whom he expected a more favourable reception: if she, too, rejected his addresses, he never thought of retiring into deserts, or pining in hope∣less distress: he persuaded himself, that, instead of loving the lady, he only fancied that he had loved her; and so all was well again. When fortune wore her angriest look, and he at last fell into the power of his most deadly enemy, Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> (being confined a close pri∣soner
<PB N="228" REF="032200_0127_0FF184B95676F618"/>
in the castle of <HI>Valenciennes,</HI>) he never attempted to support his distress by wisdom or philosophy, for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at himself and his persecutor, and seemed infinitely pleased at his new situation. In this mansion of distress, though secluded from his friends, though denied all the amusements and even the conveniences, of life, he still retain∣ed his good-humour; laughed at all the little spite of his enemies; and carried the jest so far, as to be revenged, by writing the life of his gaoler.</P>
<P>All that the wisdom of the proud can teach, is to be stubborn or sullen under misfortunes. The Cardinal's example will instruct us to be merry in circumstances of the highest affliction. It matters not whether our good-humour be construed by others into insensibility, or even ideotism; it is happiness to ourselves, and none but a fool would measure his satisfaction by what the world thinks of it. For my own part, I never pass by one of our prisons for debt, that I no not envy that felicity which is still going for∣ward among those people, who forget the cares of the world by being shut out from its ambition.</P>
<P>The happiest silly fellow I ever knew, was of the number of those good-natured creatures that are said to do no harm to any but themselves. Whenever he fell into any misery, he usually called it, Seeing Life. If his head was broke
<PB N="229" REF="032200_0127_0FF184B95676F618"/>
by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a sharper, he comforted himself by imitating the <HI>Hibernian</HI> di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lect of the one, or the more fashionable cant of the other. Nothing came amiss to him. His inattention to money matters had incensed his father to such a degree, that all the intercession of friends in his favour was fruitless. The old gentleman was on his death-bed. The whole family, and <HI>Dick</HI> among the number, gathered around him. "I leave my second son, <HI>Andrew,</HI>" said the expiring miser, "my whole estate, and desire him to be frugal." <HI>Andrew,</HI> in a sorrow∣ful tone, as is usual on these occasions, prayed Heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it himself. "I recommend <HI>Simon,</HI> my third son, to the care of his elder brother, and leave him, beside, four thousand pounds." "Ah! father," cried <HI>Simon</HI> (in great affliction, to be sure), "May Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself." At last, turning to poor <HI>Dick,</HI> "As for you, you have always been a sad dog; you'll never come to good; you'll never be rich; I'll leave you a shilling to buy a halter." "Ah! father," cries <HI>Dick,</HI> without any emotion, "may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your∣self!" This was all the trouble the loss of for∣tune gave this thoughtless imprudent creature. However, the tenderness of an uncle recompens∣ed the neglect of a father; and my friend is
<PB N="230" REF="032200_0128_0FF184BC2FF2F6A0"/>
now not only excessively good-humoured, but competently rich.</P>
<P>Yes, let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball; at an author who laughs at the public, which pronounces him a dunce; at a general who smiles at the reproach of the vul∣gar, or the lady who keeps her good-humour in spite of scandal; but such is the wisest behaviour that any of us can possibly assume; it is certain∣ly a better way to oppose calamity by dissipation, than to take up the arms of reason or resolution to oppose it: by the first method, we forget our miseries; by the last, we only conceal them from others: by struggling with misfortunes, we are sure to receive some wounds in the conflict; but a sure method to come off victorious, is by running away.</P>

<HEAD>PICTURE OF A CRITIC.</HEAD>
<P>A CRITIC is often guided by the same mo∣tives that direct his author. The author endea∣vours to persuade us, that he has written a good book: the critic is equally solicitous to shew that he could write a better, had he thought proper. A critic is a being possessed of all the vanity, but not the genius, of a scholar; inca∣pable, from his native weakness, of lifting him∣self from the ground, he applies to contiguous merit for support, makes the sportive sallies of another's imagination his serious employment, pretends to take our feelings under his care, teaches where to condemn, where to lay the emphasis of praise, and may with as much jus∣tice be called a man of taste, as the <HI>Chinese</HI> who measures his wisdom by the length of his nails.</P>
<P>If, then, a book, spirited or humorous, hap∣pens to appear in the republic of letters, several critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a single line of it, for themselves had read it; and they know what is most proper to excite laughter. Other critics contradict the ful∣minations of this tribunal, call them all spiders, and assure the public, that the ought to laugh without restraint. Another set are in the mean time quietly employed in writing notes to the
<PB N="237" REF="032200_0131_0FF184C5326F7408"/>
book, intended to shew the particular passages to be laughed at: when these are out, others still there are, who write notes upon notes. Thus a single new book employs not only the paper∣makers, the printers, the press-men, the book∣binders, the hawkers, but twenty critics, and as many compilers. In short, the body of the learned may be compared to a <HI>Persian</HI> army, where there are many pioneers, several sutlers, numberless servants, women and children in abundance, and but few soldiers.</P>

<HEAD>FORTUNE THE ONLY REPRESENTA∣TIVE OF LOVE AND AFFECTION AMONG THE MODERNS.</HEAD>
<P>THE formalities, delays and disappointments, that precede a treaty of marriage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>England.</HI></NOTE> here, are usually as numerous as those previous to a treaty of peace. The laws of this country are finely calculated to promote all commerce, but the commerce between the sexes. Their encourage∣ments for propagating hemp, madder and tobac∣co, are indeed admirable! Marriages are the only commodity that meets with discourage∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="032200_0132_0FF184C96A3BE7A8"/>
Yet, from the vernal softness of the air, the verdure of the fields, the transparency of the streams, and the beauty of the women, I know few countries more proper to invite to courtship. Here Love might sport among painted lawns and warbling groves, and revel amidst gales wafting at once both fragrance and harmony. Yet it seems he has forsaken the island; and when a couple are now to be married, mutual love, or an union of minds, is the last and most trifling consideration. If their goods and chattels can be brought to unite, their sympathetic souls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty. The gentleman's mortgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the lady's marriageable grove; the match is struck up; and both parties are piously in love—according to act of parliament.</P>
<P>Thus, they who have fortune, are possessed at least of something that is lovely; but I actually pity those who have none. I am told there was a time, when ladies, with no other merit but youth, virtue, and beauty, had a chance for hus∣bands, at least among our clergymen and officers. The blush and innocence of sixteen was said to have a powerful influence over these two profes∣sions. But of late, all the little traffic of blushing, ogling, dimpling, and smiling, has been forbid∣den by an act in that case wisely made and provi∣ded. A lady's whole cargo of smiles, sighs, and whispers, is declared utterly contraband, till she
<PB N="239" REF="032200_0132_0FF184C96A3BE7A8"/>
arrives in the warm latitude twenty-two, where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay. She is then permitted to dimple and smile, when the dimples begin to forsake her; and, when perhaps grown ugly, is charitably intrusted with an unlimited use of her charms. Her lov∣ers, however, by this time, have forsaken her; the captain has changed for another mistress; the priest himself leaves her in solitude, to bewail her virginity, and she dies even without benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>Thus you find the <HI>Europeans</HI> discouraging love with as much earnestness as the rudest savage of <HI>Sofala.</HI> The Genius is surely now no more. In every region there seem enemies in arms to oppress him. Avarice in <HI>Europe,</HI> jealousy in <HI>Persia,</HI> ceremony in <HI>China,</HI> poverty among the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and last in <HI>Circassia,</HI> are all prepared to oppose his power. The Genius is certainly banished from earth, though once ador∣ed under such a variety of forms. He is no where to be found; and all that the ladies of each country can produce, are but a few trifling reliques, as instances of his former residence and favour.</P>
<P>"The Genius of Love," says the Eastern Apologue, "had long resided in the happy plains of <HI>Abra,</HI> where every breeze was health, and every sound produced tranquillity. His temple at first was crowded, but every age lessened
<PB N="240" REF="032200_0133_0FF184CB13F9BD30"/>
the number of his votaries, or cooled their devotion. Perceiving, therefore, his altars at length quite deserted, he was resolved to re∣move to some more propitious region; and he apprised the fair sex of every country, where he could hope for a proper reception, to as∣sert their right to his presence among them. In return to this proclamation, embassies were sent from the ladies of every part of the world to invite him, and to display the superiority of their claims.</P>
<P>"And, first, the beauties of <HI>China</HI> appeared. No country could compare with them for mo∣desty, either of look, dress, or behaviour; their eyes were never lifted from the ground; their robes, of the most beautiful silk, hid their hands, bosom, and neck, while their faces only were left uncovered. They indulged no airs that might express loose desires, and they seemed to study only the graces of inanimate beauty. Their black teeth and plucked eye-brows were, however, alledged by the Genius against them; but he set them entirely aside, when he came to examine their little feet.</P>
<P>"The beauties of <HI>Circassia</HI> next made their appearance. They advanced, hand in hand, singing the most immodest airs, and leading up a dance in the most luxurious attitudes. Their dress was but half a covering; the neck, the left breast, and all the limbs were exposed to
<PB N="241" REF="032200_0133_0FF184CB13F9BD30"/>
view; which, after some time, seemed rather to satiate than inflame desire. The lily and the rose contended in forming their complexions; and a soft sleepiness of eye added irresistible poig∣nance to their charms: but their beauties were obtruded, not offered, to their admirers; they seemed to give, rather than receive courtship: and the Genius of Love dismissed them as un∣worthy his regard, since they exchanged the duties of love, and made themselves not the pur∣sued, but the pursuing sex.</P>
<P>"The kingdom of <HI>Kashmire</HI> next produced its charming deputies. This happy region seem∣ed peculiarly sequestered by Nature for his abode. Shady mountains fenced it on one side from the scorching sun; and sea-born breezes, on the other, gave peculiar luxuriance to the air. Their complexions were of a bright yellow, that ap∣peared almost transparent, while the crimson tulip seemed to blossom on their cheeks. Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the statuary's power to express; and their teeth whit∣er than their own ivory. He was almost per∣suaded to reside among them, when, unfortunate∣ly, one of the ladies talked of appointing his sera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</P>
<P>"In this procession the naked inhabitants of <HI>Southern America</HI> would not be left behind: their charms were found to surpass whatever the warmest imagination could conceive; and
<PB N="242" REF="032200_0134_0FF184CDEA79C398"/>
served to shew, that beauty could be perfect, even with the seeming disadvantage of a brown complexion. But their savage education ren∣dered them utterly unqualified to make the proper use of their power, and they were reject∣ed as being incapable of uniting mental with sensual satisfaction. In this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their suits rejected: the black beauties of <HI>Benin,</HI> and the tawny daughters of <HI>Borneo,</HI> the women of <HI>Wida</HI> with scarred faces, and the hideous virgins of <HI>Cafra∣ria;</HI> the squab ladies of <HI>Lapland,</HI> three feet high, and the giant fair-ones of <HI>Patagonia.</HI></P>
<P>"The beauties of <HI>Europe</HI> at last appeared; grace in their steps, and sensibility smiling in every eye. It was the universal opinion, while they were approaching, that they would prevail; and the Genius seemed to lend them his most favourite attention. They opened their preten∣sions with the utmost modesty; but unfortu∣nately, as their orator proceeded, she happened to let fall the words, 'House in Town, Settle∣ment, and Pin-money.' These seemingly harm∣less terms had instantly a surprising effect: the Genius, with ungovernable rage, burst from amidst the circle; and, waving his youthful pi∣nions, left this earth, and flew back to those aetherial mansions from whence he descended.</P>
<P>"The whole assembly was struck with amaze∣ment; they now justly apprehended that fe∣male
<PB N="243" REF="032200_0134_0FF184CDEA79C398"/>
power would be no more, since love had forsaken them. They continued some time thus in a state of torpid despair, when it was proposed by one of the number, that, since the real Genius of Love had left them, in order to continue their power, they should set up an idol in his stead; and that the ladies of every country should furnish him with what each liked best. This proposal was instantly relished and agreed to. An idol of gold was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the assembly, though no way resembling the departed Genius. The ladies of <HI>China</HI> furnished the monster with wings; those of <HI>Kashmire</HI> supplied him with horns; the dames of <HI>Europe</HI> clapped a purse into his hand; and the virgins of <HI>Congo</HI> furnished him with a tail. Since that time, all the vows addressed to Love, are, in reality, paid to the idol; while, as in other false religions, the adoration seems most fervent, where the heart is least sincere.</P>
