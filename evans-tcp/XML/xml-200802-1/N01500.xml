<P>T<HI>HE Mercies shewed by the God of</HI> Israel, <HI>to his People in this Wilder∣ness, deserve a lasting Memorial; And the Glorious Arm of Divine Conduct in the several passages thereof to be Recorded, that they may be transmitted to Posterity to Read and Admire; and that the Lord may obtain an Everlasting Name.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have been honoured so far as to utter something of the Memory of Gods great Good∣ness, (by your Choice) before a Great and Honourable Audience; you were pleased to Command my Service on that Publick Exer∣cise, (on your Day of Election) which when performed, I justly expected might have pe∣rish'd as some immature Abortive, and ne∣ver more have seen the Light: But since your pleasure is to make Publick what my weakness then deliver'd, your Order hath not

<HEAD>God's Conduct of His Church With His Glorious Arm.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Isaiah LXIII. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>That led them by the Right Hand of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> with his Glorious Arm, dividing the Water before them, to make Himself an Ever∣lasting Name.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT hath been an Ancient, Laudable, Ce∣lebrated Custome, on our Anniversary Elections, (formerly of Governours, but always of Assistants in Govern∣ment) to Invocate the Divine Presence, and Consult the Sacred Oracles for Direction in so Weighty an Affair.</P>
<P>By the dispose of Divine Providence, it hath fallen to my Allotment, and at the Plea∣sure of those Worthy and Honourable Gentle∣men, the Representatives of this Province, I find my self exposed, and have this task put upon me; which I am very sensible, might have been better performed and accepted by
<PB N="4" REF="001780_0006_0FB823F645877F30"/>
some other Person, better acquainted with the present circumstances and state of Affairs a∣mongst us.</P>
<P>But since it cannot be prevented, that I would crave, is only a candid Interpretation of what may be very plainly, but sincerely offered; it not being presumption, but obedience, that makes me comply in my present offerings, who have reason to account my self the weakest &amp; most unworthy of my Brethren that minister at the Altar.</P>
<P>That which I have to offer to this Great and Honourable, the General Assembly of this Province; and in the Audience of the Reve∣rend Elders, and all good Christians now Con∣ven'd: Let it be some brief and suitable Re∣flections on the Divine Providence, in the Lords Conduct of his Church thro' the Wil∣derness of this World, or from one part of the Wilderness of this World to another.</P>
<P>This is admirably Exemplified in our Text, by the famous Instance of God's Conduct of <HI>Is∣rael</HI> of Old (the only Church upon Earth, the National Church of the <HI>Jews</HI>) thro' the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> and into, and in the Wilderness by the Right hand of <HI>Moses,</HI> with Gods Glorious Arm (for forty years together) to make him∣self an Everlasting Name.</P>
<P>Which may be improved as a parallel In∣stance, and may put us upon a Reflection of Gods Conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> People (our Fathers) o∣ver a far greater Sea (the vast <HI>Atlantick Oce∣an</HI>)
<PB N="5" REF="001780_0007_0FB823F7A1FE7FD8"/>
into this <HI>American</HI> Desart, this vast how∣ling Wilderness; and his Conducting us here by faithful and excellent Guides and Gover∣nours, as it were by the Right hand of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> with his Glorious Arm, for more than twice Forty Years, whereby he hath made to himself an Everlasting Name.</P>
<P>But lest I should <HI>in ipso limine impingere,</HI> and forget the limits of time alotted; I must mind you, that our Text is a brief Compendi∣um, or an Abridgement of that Famous Cele∣brated History of Gods Conduct of his Church from <HI>Egypt</HI> thro' the Wilderness, and in the Wilderness: In which Conduct, four things are pointed out in our Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Divine Power and Providence of God, figuratively set forth by the Metaphor of his Arm, his Glorious Arm; (who led them by the Right hand of <HI>Moses</HI> with his Glorious Arm) the Arm of God in Scripture Language, denotes the Power of God: <HI>Brachium ponitur pro Robore, Fortitudine, Potentia.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Instrument improved in this Glori∣ous Conduct, <HI>scil. Moses:</HI> Famous for his Pre∣servation in his Infancy, taken out of an Ark of Bulrushes, in his Education in <HI>Ravennel,</HI> in the Court of <HI>Egypt, Exod.</HI> 6. 6, 15, 16. <HI>Deut.</HI> 4. 34. And also the Lords honouring him to be King of <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un,</HI> Captain General of the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> to lead them by his Right hand, with Gods Glorious Arm, (that led them by the Right hand of <HI>Moses,</HI> with his Glorious Arm)
<PB N="6" REF="001780_0008_0FB823F8F8B4B170"/>
<HI>i. e.</HI> Gods Glorious Arm march'd gallantly at <HI>Moses's</HI> Right hand, which made the Con∣duct so much the more Illustrious and Glorious.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have the Glorious Arm of God's Conduct exemplified in one particular Instance, instead of all others, <HI>soil.</HI> in leading his People miraculously thro' the Sea; intimated in that expression in our Text, (dividing the waters before them, the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and also <HI>Jordan,</HI> Ex∣od. 14. 21. <HI>Josh.</HI> 3. 15, 16.</P>
<P N="4">4. The ultimate end of this Divine Conduct is pointed to in the close of our Text, <HI>soil.</HI> Gods Glory, the Glory of his Name; (to make himself an Everlasting Name) with re∣ference both to his Power &amp; Providence, as re∣specting either his Aim and End in doing what he did; or the effect of it when it was done, it got him Renown: <HI>Who led them by the Right hand of</HI> Moses, <HI>with his Glorious Arm, to make himself an Everlasting Name.</HI></P>
<P>You may take up this Doctrine from the words, as the ground of our Ensuing Discourse.</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>To make Himself an Everlasting Name, is the prime and ultimate end of Gods Exerting his Glo∣rious Arm of Divine Power and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Conducting his Church and People thro' the Wil∣derness of this World; or from one part of the Wilderness of this World to another.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001780_0009_0FB823FA6E82B148"/>
For Confirmation hereof, I might lead you thro' the whole History of the Scriptures; wherein we may trace the footsteps of the Won∣der Working Providences of God in his Care and Conduct of his Church, and Judgments up∣on their Enemies, which have remarks put upon them every where by Gods Holy Prophets; And by way of Imitation in treating the Subject un∣der our present Consideration, I might improve their method.</P>
<P>Our Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> in our Text, points out unto us the Ancient way of Preaching in Old Testament times, which was an Historical Narra∣tion of Memorable Mercies and Remarkable Judg∣ments relating to Gods Church, or his Churches Enemies: Mercies and Judgments were the Texts they Preached on; hence is that of the Psalmist, <HI>I will Sing of Mercy and of Judgment unto thee Oh Lord,</HI> Psal. 101. 1.</P>
<P>But let it suffice to Confirm this Doctrine from the particular Instance in our Text, wherein as in a Glass we may behold the Providence of God, his Wisdom, Glory, Power and Goodness exercised towards his People at all times. Now that there was so much of the Praise-worthy Excellency and Goodness of God Discovered in this Conduct of his People, the Scriptures do frequently declare: Hence so many Psalms of Praise made concerning it: After Ages transmit∣ting down to their Children the Glory of God appearing therein.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. 106. 1, 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Praise ye the Lord &amp;c.

he might make his mighty Power to be known</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. 78. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Oh God when thou wentest forth before thy People, when thou didst march thro' the Wilderness, the Earth shook,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">12. 17. 68. 7, 8</NOTE> <HI>the Heavens dropped at the Presence of God!</HI> Sinai <HI>it self was moved at the Presence of the God of Israel.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jer. 32. 6. Deut. 32. 10, 11 1 31.</NOTE> Gods Conduct of them is elsewhere observed and commemorated: Hence are those frequently repeated Commands at their arrival at <HI>Canaan</HI> to Remember and never For∣get the works of God which they had seen in the Wilderness: No place so much Discovered the Wonderful Works wrought for them by the Glo∣rious Arm of God, as that,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Deut. 8. 2.

<P>Very memorable were the Wonders wrought for Gods <HI>Israel</HI> in the Land of <HI>Ham,</HI> in the Field of <HI>Zoan,</HI> the Royal City of <HI>Egypt,</HI> an an∣cient City.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 78. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their Fathers, in the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>in the field of</HI> Zoan. But especially very memorable was the Lords bringing them out of <HI>AEgypt</HI> by the Right hand of <HI>Moses</HI> with his Glorious Arm, for it was with a strong Hand, and out∣stretched Arm, with signs, wonders, and very great terrour,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jer. 2. 31.</NOTE> <HI>And hast brought forth thy People</HI> Israel <HI>out of the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>with signs, and with wonders, with a strong Hand, with a stretched out Arm, and with great Terrour.</HI></P>

<HI>Egypt</HI> one after another, before <HI>Pharoah</HI> would let them go; and after he had dismiss'd them, and they were marched forth, they were as Hotly pursued by that Dragon <HI>Phoraoh,</HI> and his formidable Army of Chariots and Horsemen, who soon overtook the unarmed Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> Encamping by the Red Sea, besides <HI>Phihahiroth,</HI> at the mouth of <HI>Hiroth,</HI> or entrance or straits of <HI>Hiroth;</HI> where were two great Mountains, betwixt which <HI>Israel</HI> marched; and were inclos'd on both sides, between <HI>Migdall,</HI> and <HI>Baalzephon,</HI> two strong Garrison Cities of <HI>Egypt:</HI> And thus was <HI>Israel</HI> Entangled, the Red Sea before them, and strong Garrisons, and Inaccessible Mountains on each side, and <HI>Pharaoh</HI> with his Enraged Army of Chariots &amp; Horsemen on their backs.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 14. 9, 19.</NOTE> Oh the Distress that <HI>Israel</HI> was now in! Why s:aith <HI>Moses, stand still, and see the Salvation of the Lord;</HI> they cry, Heaven hears and Commands the march, the Sea Divides; The Lord discovers to them the Worlds Foundations. The Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> they march into the Sea as on Dry Ground, the Sea is made fordable, the waters stand on heaps on each side: The Angel of God, that went before the Camp of <HI>Israel, soil.</HI> The Angel of Gods Presence, the Lord Jesus Christ, remov'd and went behind them, betwixt <HI>Israel</HI> and the Host of the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> so the Glory of the Lord was their Rere-ward. <HI>Isai.</HI> 5. 12. and 58. 8.</P>
<P><HI>Pharaoh</HI> and the <HI>Egyptians</HI> pursue them into the midst of the Sea; And now was the time that God cut <HI>Rahab,</HI> and wounded the Dragon, and made the Depths of the Sea a way for the Ransomed of the Lord to pass over. When the Church of God is upon their motion, all things

<PB N="11" REF="001780_0013_0FB8240366F1B618"/>
but all this was to make himself an Everlasting Name: This indeed was the end of all Gods Wonderful Works, both of Creation and of Providence, but especially of his Churches pre∣servation, and most especially of the Glorious Work of Redemption; the foundation whereof was Everlasting Love, and the Topstone shall be laid with shouting, Grace Grace unto it, <HI>Zach.</HI> 4. that hereby the Lord might make to himself an Everlasting Name.</P>
<P N="1">1. To make himself an Everlasting Name, was the great end of the Works of Creation; therefore God call'd up this great World out of nothing, for this end he fram'd the stately Fabrick of this vast and beautiful Universe; he hath planted the Heavens, that stately Su∣perstructure, that vaulted Roof, and bespangled Canopy over our heads; wherein he hath set a tabernacle for the Sun, and appointed the Ordnances of Heaven, with the influential Con∣stellations thereof, and guides <HI>Arcturus</HI> with his Sons, and hath made <HI>Orion,</HI> the <HI>Pleides,</HI> and the Chambers of the South; and all this to make himself an Everlasting Name: Hence that of the Psalmist, Psal. 19. 1. <HI>The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament shew∣eth his handy-work.</HI> And he hath also laid the Beams of his Chambers in the Waters, and fixed the Groundsels and Foundations of the World, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing, <HI>Job</HI> 26. 7. he stretcheth out the North over the empty place, and the Earth hangs equally poized with its own weight, which made the very Heathen to admire: Hence that of <HI>Ovid,</HI>
<Q><PB N="12" REF="001780_0014_0FB82405064A6D88"/>
<L>Terra pilae similis nullo fulcimine nixa,</L>
<L>Aere sublato tam grave p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndet onus.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is wonderful, that the vast Globe of the pondrous Earth and Sea, should thus hang without some solid thing to uphold it? This makes the Lord an Everlasting Name; who laid the Foundations of the Earth, that it should not be removed for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. To make himself an Everlasting Name, is the end of all Gods wonder-working Provi∣dences in the World; ordering all things to his own Glory, and for the good of his Church, &amp; the destruction of all the implacable Adver∣saries thereof; as <HI>Pharoah</HI> is a special example, yielding to us a fair demonstration of a Re∣venging Deity, and of a Divine Nemesis.</P>
<P>But to come up to the present purpose from the Instance in our Text, to make a parallel of it, in order to Application, we may Enquire,</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Wherein was Gods Glorious Arm so Illustrious in his Peoples Conduct thro' the Wil∣derness, as to make himself an Everlasting Name.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In general, the sum or principal of it is, in that he brought his People <HI>Israel,</HI> by and thro' Travels unto Rest, Troubles unto Peace, Wants unto Supplies, Distresses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto Deliverances; yea, through and from
<PB N="13" REF="001780_0015_0FB82406D4923C40"/>
great wants unto great supplies; and from great and eminent dangers and distresses un∣to great Salvations, which he wrought for them; he turned all things to the best, even his Churches Bricks made in their Bondage, were turned into Saphires.</P>
<P>Now in this way of the Lords Dispensati∣on, was made bare the Arm of three of Gods Glorious Attributes; the Glorious Arm of his Power, of his Wisdom, and of his Good∣ness.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Glorious Arm of Gods Power, a∣bove the Power of man, in helping when means failed, when they could not help them∣selves; in working <HI>in oppositis mediis</HI> means, and commanding light to shine out of dark∣ness, turning evil into good to them, &amp; doing things when at the greatest difficulty; fetch∣ing Waters out of Rocks, making Rivers to run in the Dasart, <HI>&amp;c</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 18. 33, 34, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, 39.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Lord doth oft make things difficult that he may the more shew his Power; so oft it was with <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness, things come to the extremity, and beyond the tho't of man, how they should have help; and then the Lord shews his Power.</P>
<P>When <HI>Moses</HI> despaired of Provision (and <HI>Moses said) The people among whom I am, are six hundred thousand foot-men; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a
<PB N="14" REF="001780_0016_0FB82407F2E73C18"/>
whole month.</HI> (Saith <HI>Moses) Shall the stocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</HI> And the Lord said unto <HI>Moses, Is the Lords hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee, or not.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Glorious Arm of Gods Wisdom ap∣peared, in making curious contrivances of his Works, and bringing things about wonderful∣ly, above the reach of man; leading in a Wilderness: He is a wise Guide that can lead and guide thro' a Wilderness, and find the way out. So these Wilderness Leadings and Salvations are works, wherein Mercy imployes all the Attributes of God, and so Wisdom; in special, Wisdom in bringing things about in a most wonderful manner when at wits end; making Dejection the way to Exaltation; also in using fit means to do his People good, in doing many things at once; taking vengeance on their Enemies, chastising, humbling his own People Saving in fit seasons by wonderful ways and means.</P>
<P>There is an extraordinariness in Gods Wil∣derness-works, they are not accomplish'd in a plain and ordinary manner; but there is there∣in a discovery of Infinite Wisdom.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Glorious Arm of Divine Mercy &amp; Goodness appeared, in making his Peoples<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. 11. 22, 23. Exod. 14. 13,</NOTE>
<PB N="15" REF="001780_0017_0FB82409A6F49C48"/>
misery his opportunity; in coming in the hour of Difficulty, in the article of Distress, when help was sweet and precious, when mer∣cy would be most illustrious; in remembring in their low estate, as he oft did.</P>
<P>The sweetest help is help in Distress, and then most of the goodness of God is tasted. A Mercy in the Wilderness is the sweetest Mercy of all.</P>
<P>But more particularly, His Glorious Arm of Divine Goodness appeared in Leading His People, if we consider the <HI>Terminus a quo e∣ad quem.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In regard of the Term from which he brought them, <HI>soil.</HI> from <HI>Egypt,</HI> an House of Bondage, a Furnace of Iron, from under Task∣masters, from out of the Brick-kilns, from the midst of Idolatry. That he brought them out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> we know how much is spoken of in Scripture. Better be in the Wilderness, than in <HI>Egypt:</HI> Better be serving and following the Lord in a Wilderness, in a Land that was not sown, than serving cruel men, and defiling themselves with the Abominations of <HI>Egypt;</HI> now the Lord led them, and there was no strange God with them. <HI>Egypt</HI> was a Type of the state of Sin and Misery, out of which God leads his own People.</P>
<P N="2">2. In regard of the Term to which he was leading them; namely, to <HI>Canaan,</HI> Rest, that is the end; the Wilderness is the way to <HI>Ca∣naan,</HI> and there they arrive at last; the hope
<PB N="16" REF="001780_0018_0FB8241026FDD790"/>
of that makes Travel easie and sweet, the Journeys end makes amends for all; and the enjoyment of it at last, is the more sweet; we say, <HI>All is well that ends well.</HI></P>
<P>But the Wilderness, tho' a place of Afflicti∣on, was a place of much mercy; they were in the Wilderness, but God led them there, was with them there, and did great things there for them. Particularly, let me Instance in some of the special Mercies of God in his Glorious Arm of Conduct of his People by the Right hand of <HI>Moses</HI> in the Wilderness, which may be of use in the Application.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Lord set up RELIGION among them, gave them Statutes and Judgments, and Rules to walk by; the Lord gave them his Word, this was a distinguishing favour: <HI>He shewed his Word unto</HI> Jacob, <HI>his Statutes and his Judgments unto</HI> Israel; <HI>he hath not dealt so with any Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Never had the People of God so much of his Word given to them, as now since they came into the Wilderness. <HI>Moses</HI> the first Writer of Holy Scripture, was given them to be their Leader in the Wilderness, &amp; to deliver the first Scriptures in writing; and it is like he writ not only the four last, but <HI>Genesis</HI> also, in the Wilderness. He acted as an Extraor∣dinary Prophet; and then also by his Mini∣stry, the Law was given on Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI> In the Wilderness God gave them both Law &amp; Gospel; the Law was delivered on the Mount,
<PB N="17" REF="001780_0019_0FB82412ACD13888"/>
and the Gospel was Preached in the Renewing Gods Covenant with them; and in the extra∣ordinary Types of the <HI>Brazen Serpent,</HI> which <HI>Moses</HI> in the Wilderness lifted up.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>vid.</HI> Par. Prol. in Gen Joh. 3. 14.</NOTE> <HI>And of the Rock, whose waters follow'd them; and of the Manna,</HI> &amp;c. In a word, in the wilderness God opened his mind and heart to them; now they were alone, he revealed both Law and Gospel in a larger and fuller manner than ever he did before.</P>
<P>Again, the SABBATH had been Instituted from the Beginning, and the Law of it had al∣ways been in force, as other Moral Laws, but much neglected and forgotten; therefore God solemnly made it known, and called them to Remember it on Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> this was his great mercy, to give them the clear Rule of the Sabbath in the Wilderness, and to reduce them to the careful Observation of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. He set up his TABERNACLE among them in the Wilderness, he gave them Ordi∣nances and Institutions, and Priests and Levites to Dispense all the Ordinances of God to them, according to that <HI>Mosaical</HI> Paedagogy; having also caused them to Renew their Covenant with him, their Church-Covenant; for so that is, <HI>Exod.</HI> 19. being a Social Covenant, wherein many People together, did engage themselves to the Lord; thus God brought them near to him, and Set up his Tabernacle among them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="001780_0020_0FB82413E3D19228"/>
3. The Lord set up Government among them, Civil Government; he gave them Laws, so also Magistrates with Power to execute these Laws. Not only <HI>Moses,</HI> an extraordinary Person to be King of <HI>Jeshurun,</HI> whom the Lord raised up to bear their lumber, and to manage the Difficult work of Leading that People as in our Text. He led them by the Right hand of <HI>Moses.</HI>—But also others were appointed according to <HI>Je∣thro's</HI> Council for ordinary standing Rulers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod, 18. 21, 22, 25.</NOTE> <HI>Thou shalt provide out of the People able Men, such as fear God, men of trust, hating Covetousness; and place such over the People to be Rulers of thousands, and Rulers of hundreds, also of Fifties and of Tens, and let them Judge the People at all seasons.</HI> And also afterward the settled seventy Elders to be <HI>Mo∣ses'</HI>s Assistants (which were after the settled Coun∣cil &amp; chief Court, called the <HI>Sanhedrin</HI> or the <HI>Syne∣drion</HI>) of which we Read<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Numb. 6. 11, 16, 17 26, 30.</NOTE> Hence we so often Read of the Elders of <HI>Israel</HI> and the heads of the People and their Judges and Officers, all sorts of Rulers.</P>
<P>The Lord did not bring them from under their Taskmasters in <HI>Egypt,</HI> into the Wilderness to turn Libertines, and to do what is Right in their own Eyes, to despise to be Ruled by any of their Brethren—Altho' some of them rose up against that Order and Government the Lord had set them under; but the Lord did solemnly and dreadfully declare himself against them, as he will sooner or later show that he will not bear with those that refuse to submit to Order, either in Church or Common Wealth: And Oh what a Mercy is it to Enjoy Government, this was a

favour to <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness, the Lord ap∣pointed Government for them and Officers of all sorts, and this was his great Mercy to them; and so he also in the Wilderness gave them a Militia, and order'd the same Bands of Soldiers and Armies to be ready for Defence; as in the beginning of <HI>Numbers</HI> we read at large.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the Lords Conduct of them with his Glo∣rious Arm, he delivered them from their Enemies, and gave them peace in the Wilderness. He de∣livered them from <HI>Pharaoh</HI> that pursued them, and wrought wonderful Salvation; and so he delivered them from the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> who set on them in the Wilderness in their weakness. The Lord was their Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, the Lord was offended at their E∣nemies, so he delivered them from <HI>Sihon</HI> King of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and <HI>Og</HI> King of <HI>Bashan;</HI> he suffer'd no hand of violence to oppress or overcome them.</P>
<P N="5">5. In the Wilderness God provided for them, and supplyed their wants; their outward wants and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wonderfully; they were in wants some∣times, and brought to distress, and unbelieving Hearts failed them, and they cryed out they must perish with Hunger and Thirst; yet the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and confounded their unbelief, and pro∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed for them wonderfully, and fully supplyed them, gave them Bread; spread a table for them in the Wilderness, gave them water in the Dry &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Desart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 2. 2, 3.

And tho' they were in a Wilderness, yet God sent them seasonable supplyes; he pro∣vided for them in his own way, and by his own

means; Bread which their Fathers knew not.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Lord wonderfully and mercifully spared them, notwithstanding their Murmuring and ma∣nifold Sins and Provocations. Unbelief, Rebelli∣on, Forgetfulness of God, Impatience, Discourage∣ment, Distrust, Idolatries; after so many great works and wonders the Lord wrought among them, and manifestations of himself to them.</P>
<P>One would wonder that God spared them. And when we read the Story, we Marvel that they should be so unbelieving, and refractory, and so soon running after one evil or other. Oh we may Read our selves in it; were a story writ∣ten of the turnings of our Hearts and ways, it would be as bad.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Lord did them good in the end by all their greatest evils, he humbled them by their Afflictions; yea, by their Corruptions, brought them acquainted with their own Hearts; and their Wilderness troubles prepared them for <HI>Canaan.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The Lord heard their Prayers in the Wil∣derness. Were they in any want, it was but ask and have; and how oft did he hear <HI>Moses</HI> for them; oft God heard the cryes of their Necessi∣ties, yea, Murmurings; and when in time of Affliction for their Sins, they cryed to the Lord▪ he heard them tho' vile.</P>

<PB N="21" REF="001780_0023_0FB82418CA6F0158"/>
Application, which the Premises afford abundant matter of</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. I might apply this Truth to the Church and People of God in General, and then to our selves in this Wilderness in particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. Relating to the Church and People of God in General, and Gods Conduct of his Church thro' the Wilderness of this World with his Glorious Arm. Gods Church may be said to be in a Wil∣derness while in this World▪ the World we live in is a Desart Vale, a time and place of Changes, Sorrows, Straits, yea of Sin and Unbelief too.</P>
<P>We read of the Woman <HI>i. e.</HI> the Church that fled into the Wilderness where she had a place prepared of God, and that she should remain there one thousand three hundred and threescore Days, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. 6. And this is asserted, and seems to be fairly intimated by those that affirm, that the forty two months, or the one thousand two hundred and sixty days, mention'd in the pre∣ceding Chapter, <HI>Chap</HI> 11. 3. Of the witnesses Prophesying in Sackcloth, not to be yet expired; for it is evident, that Contemporary therewith, and of the same length of time is the Womans, that is the Churches being in the Wilderness, mention'd, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. 6, 14. That these speak of the same thing, is the Judgment of the best Ex∣positours: But whether that Interpretation of these Prophetical numbers and time be undoubted or no; yet surely we need no more then expe∣rience to tell us, that the late &amp; present times, have been times of many Changes, Travels, Try∣als, Difficulties to the Church and People of God and fitly compared to a Wilderness Condition Oh the Church is yet in the Wilderness, and hath been these two last Centuries past, Tra∣velling
<PB N="22" REF="001780_0024_0FB8241BA443D040"/>
thro' that horrid part of the Wilderness, the depth of the Antichristian Darkness toward Reformation.</P>
<P>Let us but instance in our own Nation: Oh the Difficulties and Discouragements and Oppo∣sitions that the first Reformers in the last Age pass'd thro'; but there is still the Glorious Arm of Divine Conduct carrying on the Reformation. God hath Gloriously delivered our Nation from Papal Superstitions and Idolatries: Oh the torch of the truth of the Gospel that hath been lighted up in both <HI>Englands!</HI> And notwithstanding the many Oppositions to quench it, it hath been kept burning to this Day.</P>
<P>And Oh the Mercy of God to our Nation! wherein the Glorious Arm of Divine Conduct is remarkable in two famous Revolutions fresh in memory, the former <HI>Anno</HI> 1689. The latter in the happy Accession of so Illustrious a Pro∣testant Prince to the <HI>British</HI> Throne, as at this Day; and we his Loyal Subjects in <HI>New-England</HI> Bless our selves with the pleasing Prospect of sharing in his Royal Favours; as thinking our selves secure from a Despotick or Arbitrary Go∣vernment, or having our Liberties Invaded by Papal Usurpations and Tyrannies. Long let our King live to be the Honour of this present, and the Imitation of future Ages; and never let there want a Successour to that Protestant Line, to Sway the Scepter of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The second branch of the Use is to our selves in this Wilderness; we are, and have been in a Wilderness in propriety of speech so called: But O Generation, may the Lord say, <HI>Have I been a wilderness unto you, as Jer.</HI> 2. 31. No, but
<PB N="23" REF="001780_0025_0FB8241EAA5F59E0"/>
the Lord hath been as <HI>a shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</HI> Oh the mercies of this Wil∣derness, have exceeded those of other Plantati∣ons in <HI>America!</HI> A work never to be forgotten, is the Lords preparing this Wilderness for his People, when he swept away thousands of those Salvage Tawnies (those cursed Devil worship∣pers) with a mortal Plague, to make room for a better People, (I mean our Fathers) that came into this Wilderness to plant the Gospel, and to enlighten these dark Regions. Pardon me, I compare not the place they came from, to <HI>Egypt,</HI> God forbid I should; it was a <HI>Goshen,</HI> in comparison of <HI>Egypt;</HI> yet to speak freely, the time was, when the People of God had their Task-masters, which they sigh'd under; and the power and purity of Religion was in the <HI>House of Bondage;</HI> and heavy burdens were imposed on the necks of many of the Lords pre∣cious Servants; from which, and for the con∣trary Liberty and Purity, they were glad to fly into this Wilderness; if happily in a Wilder∣ness they might Worship and Sacrifice to the Lord their God. And Oh the powerful calling voice of God to gather his People into this Wil∣derness! And they were a choice select Number, whom God with his Glorious Arm did bring hither to lay the foundations of the Everlasting Gospel; so that we may glory in it, when we behold the Lord laying our Stones with fair colours, and our Foundations with Saphires.</P>
<P>And God has granted Prosperity to these
<PB N="24" REF="001780_0026_0FB8241FE6758908"/>
blessed Enterprizes, he has caused the Gospel to flourish in this Land; and we have not only brown bread and the Gospel, but the Bread of Life; <HI>Manna</HI> in plenty, Angels food. Oh how hath God prospered our small Beginnings, and given us Towns and Buildings, and Blessings of all sorts, and hath sown our Land with the Seed of Man and Beast; so that we can now tell <HI>of the Beasts of our Forrests, and the Cattle up∣on a thousand hills, and of our Oxen strong to la∣bour, of our Sheep that bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets,</HI> Psal. 144. The time would fail me to enumerate the passages of Gods goodness in his Conduct of his People in this Wilderness with his Glorious Arm: But take a taste in a few parallel Instances by a Re∣flection on the premises.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Lord hath given us his Everlasting Gospel in this Wilderness. God hath set up the true Religion among us, and this hath been our safety and security. Religion is the Palla∣dium of a People, or Nation; therefore God hath made the World to take notice, that <HI>New-England</HI> hath been a <HI>People Saved by the Lord.</HI> Oh we have had the true Religion among us! Oh the Glory of the Gospel that hath shined in this Land! Oh the Lively Oracles that have been delivered to us, the Gate of Heaven hath been here opened; the Gospel hath been here spread in its beauty, plainness and glory! Oh the <HI>Bethels,</HI> the many <HI>Bethels</HI> God hath E∣rected and Set up in this Wilderness!</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="25" REF="001780_0027_0FB824215F847370"/>
2. The Lord hath furnish'd us with glorious Ordinances and Ministries; he hath set up his Tabernacles among us, the Orders of his House; he hath laid before us a Platform of Discipline, and blessed us with a Gospel Order in our Churches; so that were <HI>Balaam</HI> himself here, he could not curse, but bless and admire to see the comely Order in the several Flocks of the Lords Sheep, folded together in so ma∣ny Companies. <HI>Vid. Numb.</HI> 24. 2, 5. <HI>And Ba∣laam lift up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in Tents, according to their Tribes; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him,</HI> and he said, <HI>How goodly are thy Tents Oh</HI> Jacob! <HI>and thy Tabernacles, Oh</HI> Israel! <HI>as the Valleys are they spread forth, as Gardens by the River side.</HI> Even such hath been the Blessing of our good God to his Heritage in this Land.</P>
<P N="3">3. The glorious Arm of Divine Conduct, hath fenc'd us with the hedge of Government. Oh what a favour is this! to give Government, to Establish Authority, to have a Wall of Ma∣gistracy set and kept about a People; this is a thing of unspeakable concernment; otherwise a people would be left to Anarchy and heaps of Confusion. Oh! it is thro' the love of <HI>God</HI> to <HI>Israel,</HI> if he sets a man over them, that will do Justice and Judgment, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 9. 8. <HI>Exod,</HI> 18. 21. To see those that fear <HI>God</HI> Exalted, Oh how great a Blessing! And we are to ac∣knowledge the Soveraign and Holy Counsel of <HI>God</HI> therein; <HI>and know that the Most High
<PB N="26" REF="001780_0028_0FB82422E1EA9630"/>
Ruleth in the Kingdoms▪ of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</HI> God hath granted us Ex∣cellent Guides and Governours in this Land; he hath not left us to turn <HI>Libertines,</HI> but hath set up his Government among us, hath walled us about with Magistracy; &amp; he <HI>hath made our Officers Peace, and our Exactors Righ∣teousness.</HI> And there hath been the Executi∣on of wholesome Laws, a testimony born a∣gainst prevailing Sin: If it had been other∣wise, <HI>Plectuntur Achivi,</HI> the poor People would have paid for it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Lord with his Glorious Arm hath been our Protection, and delivered us from our Enemies in this Wilderness, as he did <HI>Israel</HI> from those <HI>Amalekites;</HI> so God hath delivered us from those <HI>Amalekites,</HI> the <HI>Pequets,</HI> the <HI>Nar∣ragansets,</HI> that set upon Gods People when they were weak and tender; but how did the Lord crush and blast them, and blot out their Names from being a People as at this day; so let our Enemies perish that have committed their Outrages in this Land.</P>
<P N="5">5. God hath set up a School of the Prophets among us; a Colledge, a Seminary of Learn∣ing; this hath made <HI>New-England</HI> preferable to all the <HI>American</HI> Plantations; to the Silver Mi∣nerals, those glittering Entrails of the <HI>Spanish West-Indies.</HI> Let the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent good Conduct of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, be continued and encouraged, and Schools of Learning advanced, for the renewed Supplies of such <HI>Streams as may rejoice the City and Church of God.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="27" REF="001780_0029_0FB82427C9A986A8"/>
6. The Lord hath spread a Table for us in this Wilderness and supplyed our wants from year to year, and every year; the year last past, was an eminent Instance of this; in the time of that lasting scorching drought, when our Hearts and our Hopes failed us: God did secretly and unaccountably (I had almost said Miraculously) Reserve a Blessing for us, that there was Bread to the sower, a supply for our necessities; this was the Lords doing, and it is Marvellous in our Eyes, it was Gods Glorious Arm that effected it; Oh let His Everlasting Name be Magnified.</P>
<P>Oh how hath the Lord provided for us from year to year, and sometimes plentifully; this is indeed to rain Bread in a Wilderness. Oh the Thousands of poor Creatures among us, whose Loins and Bowels do bless the Lord! Very Na∣ture teaches us Gratitude for this, who else in their Poverty might have fainted and perish'd for want of Bread.</P>
<P N="7">7. God hath done all this for us, notwith∣standing our many Sins and Provocations. We have been a sinful People. Oh the Lords sparing Mercy in the midst of our Sins, great cry∣ing Sins. Prophaness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mong the Wicked, Contentions among the Godly, Errours among others, woful incorrigibleness in most under the Lords dealing, we may apply to our selves those words of the Psalmist, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78. 40. <HI>How oft have we provoked him in the Wilderness, and griev'd him in the Desart; and yet being full of Compassion he forgives our Iniquity, and Destroys us not.</HI> How many times has he turn'd away his Anger, and has not stirr'd up all his Wrath. We in this Wilderness can speak this Experi∣mentally.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="28" REF="001780_0030_0FB82429CCE302E0"/>
8. God hath heard our Prayers in our straits and plunging difficulties, how often hath he heard Prayers and been found of his People in their Supplications, and how often hath he come in the nick. Oh the many sweet returns of Prayer we have had! and God hath made his Arm Glorious for our relief. When we Prayed for Rain, for fair Weather, for removal of Devourers, for Pro∣vision, for Health, for Peace, for continuance of our Civil and Sanctuary Enjoyments; God hath made his Arm Glorious, and Glorified that Title among us that he is, <HI>A God hearing Prayer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ʋse</HI> 2. Beware of those Sins that may pro∣voke the Lord to withdraw the Glorious Arm of his Conduct. I shall hint only at some that are more obvious.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of despising a Glorious Gospel, or ill treating the Dispensers of it. When <HI>Israel</HI> mocked the Messengers of God, despised his Words, and misused his Prophets, the Wrath of God arose against his People; and there was no Re∣medy.</P>
<P>God expects his Ministers should find suitable entertainment every where, and that they should be so provided for, so as to serve the Lord with∣out distraction. There are many Townships and Precincts readily Granted, and supplyed with burning Lamps, which are like to be extinguish'd for want of Oyl to feed them; the Gospel star∣ving in some Places, and the Dispensers of it fain to work with their own hands, to admini∣ster to their Necessities.</P>
<P>It would be pleasing to God, and more Credi∣ble for our Christian Profession, if some Methods could be taken for Relief in this case.</P>
<P>Be assured that an impoverish'd starved Mi∣nistry,
<PB N="29" REF="001780_0031_0FB8242B217AE470"/>
will not only induce the Contempt of the Clergy, but also introduce a despised Gos∣pel; and if the Gospel be once despised, God will soon withdraw the Glorious Arm of his Conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2. Take heed of the Sin of Worldliness. This our Saviour cautions against, <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 15. This eats out the very heart of Religi∣on; the sweets of the World, eat out the savour of the Gospel; neither the Dread of God is feared, nor the Grace of God prized by the worldly sensual Heart. Oh the strange alteration in the spirits of men! Our Fathers left the World, for the Enjoyment of Reli∣gion in this Wilderness; but the Designs of most are Inverted: Most in these days are lea∣ving Religion in pursuit of the World. They have that, that contents them in this world; hence they are regardless of God, and the World to come. Oh! we came hither for Religion, for the Gospel; but the world hath engross'd our affections, our love, delight, de∣sires, our whole thoughts. Oh, take heed of the World! this caution the Lord gave to <HI>Israel</HI> of Old, when they had plenty and ful∣ness, Houses full of all things, and Vineyards, and Olive-trees, <HI>&amp;c. Deut.</HI> 6. 11, 12. Now be∣ware lest thou forget the Lord; so Christ gives caution, take heed of your Farms, Merchan∣dize, Yokes of Oxen, and pieces of Ground, left you make light of the Call of the Gospel; the world is full of <HI>Irritamenta malorum;</HI> it
<PB N="30" REF="001780_0032_0FB8242C9FA58C18"/>
proves a snare to new and flourishing Plantati∣ons; when the world comes in, &amp; they have a plentiful encrease, they abuse the good Crea∣tures of God to Sensuality.</P>
<P>Noah <HI>became an Husbandman, planted a Vine∣yard, drank of the wine, and was drunken,</HI> Gen. 9. 20, 21. The things of the World are incen∣tives to Lust.</P>
<P>There is at this day among us, a great out∣cry after the World, and after a Medium of Trade, to carry on worldly Interests; it's well if our over-reaching after the world in too un∣advised and bold attempts, have not marr'd our worldly Interests.</P>
<P>We live in a good Land, did we but walk humbly with our God, keep his Statutes &amp; his Judgments; were we but industrious &amp; frugal, did we avoid all excesses; <HI>we should mount up with wings as Eagles, our peace would be like a Ri∣ver, and our prosperity like the waves of the Sea; and instead of lying among the pots, we should be like</HI> Davids <HI>Dove, whose wings were covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold,</HI> Psal. 68. 13.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take heed of the Sin of Pride. It's tho't there is more expended on that one lust, than goes to the defraying our Publick Charges, ten times told; This Sin is an abomination to the Lord: And sure I am, it is ill-becoming a wil∣derness Condition, to be poor and proud.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take heed of the Sin of Oppression. That Sin hath its rounds among us; it is a crying sin, Isa. 5. 7. <HI>I looked for Judgment, but behold Op∣pression,
<PB N="31" REF="001780_0033_0FB8242FEE3A9070"/>
and for Righteousness, but behold a Cry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caution</HI> 5. Take heed of Sensuality and In∣temperance, in all the branches of it; Unchas∣tity, Gluttony, Drunkenness, the prevailing Sins of this Land.</P>
<P><HI>Caution</HI> 6. Take heed of the Sin of Murmur∣ing and Discontent, under our Priviledges and Enjoyments. We are a People for changes &amp; alterations, well if God does not make us smart for it before he's done.</P>
<P N="7">7. Take heed of advancing private Interests, under a gilded pretence of promoting a Publick Good. There is too much of Self-interest, playing its part on Publick Stages.</P>
<P><HI>Caut.</HI> 8. Take heed of the Sins of the tongue, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 10. Oh the mischief that is done by that one member! that sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire of Hell; forging, fomenting false reports, <HI>speaking evil of Digni∣ties, Jude</HI> 8. severely reproved. All Detracti∣on is positively forbidden; <HI>thou shalt not raise a false report,</HI> Exod. 33. 1.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 3. Hath the Lord led us so long in this Wilderness with his Glorious Arm, to make himself an Everlasting Name. Oh then, let <HI>New-England</HI> be a Name and a Praise to our God! Oh let us be according to our Profession, and our Priviledges! Our Profession runs very high. The name of a <HI>New-England</HI> man hath sometime been wont to carry a sound of Sancti∣ty along with it. Most surely our Obligations are very great, that call us to Holiness. Our
<PB N="32" REF="001780_0034_0FB8243370F14C00"/>
Sins therefore have an Emphasis upon them, as theirs had of Old, when it was said, <HI>All their wickedness is in</HI> Gilgal, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. A place where God had done much for their Fore-fathers.</P>
<P>Mens offences are increased by their Obligati∣ons: The Quality of the place, adds much to the greatness of the Sin; as such places as have been formerly eminent for Gods sincere Worship as <HI>Gilgal</HI> once was, the Ark of the Covenant was there; and they had their Sacrifices there; they were a Priviledg'd People, a People near to God, and God can better bear with <HI>Aliens</HI> then with his own People when they offend.</P>
<P>The <HI>Philistines</HI> may Cart the Ark of God, but if <HI>David</HI> do it, wo be to <HI>Uzza, 1 Sam.</HI> 8. 11, 15. The Place, the People, the Profession adds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Aggravation. Oh to Sin in <HI>New England,</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Sin in <HI>Gilgal.</HI> I verily believe, God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s more dishonour'd by our Sins, then by the Sins of any People in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 4▪ Let us be exceeding thankful to God for his Glorious Arm of Conduct of us to this Day in this Wilderness.
