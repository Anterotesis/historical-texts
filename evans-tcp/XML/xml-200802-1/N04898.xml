<BIBL>HEB. XI. 32, 33, 34.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And what shall I more say? For the Time would fail me to tell of</HI> Gideon, <HI>and of</HI> Barak, <HI>and of</HI> Sampson, <HI>and of</HI> Jepthah, <HI>of</HI> David <HI>also—who thro' Faith subdued Kingdoms—waxed valiant in Fight, turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.—</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE inspired Author of this Epistle, ha∣ving at the 38th Verse of the preceeding Chapter, cited that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Passage of the Apostle, <HI>The Just shall live by Faith;</HI> in this gives an Account of the Nature, Ne∣cessity, Usefulness and Excellency of Faith, and shews of what eminent Ser∣vice it was to the ancient Saints, famous in the Book of God.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006128_0004_1027EFFC95233588"/>
It was this, that animated their Obedience; carried them through the heaviest Trials; overcame the greatest Diffi∣culties; and made them more than Conquerors over their most formidable Enemies. It was this, that made <HI>the Fee∣ble as David,</HI> and the Strong as <HI>the Angel of the Lord.</HI> It was this, that enabled <HI>Martyrs</HI> patiently and joyfully to en∣dure the utmost Cruelty of their Persecutors, and the most <HI>warlike valiant Soldiers</HI> to exceed themselves, and do Won∣ders against their Enemies.</P>
<P>Of these last Feats of Faith the Apostle speaks in the Text. He mentions by Name, several <HI>Heroes</HI> renowned in the Church of God in their Day, for their Valour and Victories over the Enemies of God's People. The History of their Exploits is preserved in the sacred Records, and was written for our Learning and Admonition; as we learn from the Use the Apostle makes of it in this Place. In setting down their Names, he observes not the Order of Story, aiming only at mentioning their signal Acts of Cou∣rage and Conquest.</P>
<P>In the Story we find them all, except <HI>Barak,</HI> eminent for their Fortitude. <HI>Gideon</HI> was saluted by the Angel, as <HI>a mighty Man of Valour</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Judg. vi. 12.</NOTE> And tho' <HI>Barak,</HI> at the Time when God called him, and put him into Commission of <HI>General</HI> of the Army against the Enemies of his People, discovered something of a timerous Spirit; yet doubtless he was well known to be a Man of good Courage, and there∣fore God chose him for that important Trust and Service. God is wont ordinarily to do his Work by the fittest In∣struments. <HI>Jepth<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was known to be <HI>a mighty Man of Valour</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Judg. xi. 1.</NOTE>, and was therefore courted by the Elders of his People to be their Captain in an Expedition against their Enemies<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ver. 5, 6.</NOTE>. <HI>Sampson</HI> was famous for his great Strength and valiant Acts<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Judg. xvi. 6.</NOTE>. And <HI>David,</HI> when even a Youth and
<PB N="7" REF="006128_0005_1027EFFE1FEE9368"/>
Stripling, had the Courage to encounter with a <HI>Lion</HI> and a <HI>Bear,</HI> and the more brutish <HI>Goliah</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xvii. 36.</NOTE>; and bore the Cha∣racter of a <HI>mighty valiant Man, and a Man of War</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xvi. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These heroic Men in their Wars against the Enemies of their People, used their best Policy, and acted their natural Courage: They fought valiantly, and play'd the Men for their God, and for the Cities of their God; and they gain'd compleat Victories. Their martial Atchievements, <HI>humane Reason</HI> may be ready to ascribe to their superiour Courage and Conduct; and to look no higher: But the Apostle takes not the least Notice of them, but ascribes them to their <HI>Faith only.</HI> It was their Faith gave them Courage, and procured them Success. Their Strength of Body, Forti∣tude of Mind, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilitary Skill were <HI>natural Causes</HI> of their Success: But these alone would never have enabled them to do such great Exploits upon their Enemies, who possibly might equal them in all the natural and acquired Accom∣plishments of Soldiers; and far overmatch them in the Number, Strength and Artillery of their Armies. It was their Faith that differenced them from their Enemies: This gave them the Advantage; and was more and better to them, than Troops of Horses, Chariots of Iron, and all other Instruments of War were to their Enemies: This encouraged their Hearts and strengthened their Hands: Made them valorous and victorious: This gave the fi∣nishing Stroke to their other military Qualifications, and was the Crown of all. This inspired them with Courage and Resolution, made them undaunted at the Approach of Enemies, intripid in the most bloody Scenes of War, and <HI>valiant in Fight:</HI> This crowned their valiant Attempts with Success, <HI>turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens,</HI> those that were Aliens to their Common-Wealth, and Enemies to their Religion: And this enabled them to make proper Advantage of their Victories, <HI>to subdue Kingdoms under them,</HI> and make them tributary.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="006128_0006_1027F00129AEDE30"/>
The proud Hearts of Men are prone to take the Glory of their Courage and Success to themselves, as if they had given themselves their Courage, and by the Might of their Hand alone had gotten them Victory: But the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> attributes it wholly to their Faith, to shew that it was all of God: That the <HI>wise Man should not glory in his Wisdom, nor the mighty Man in his Might</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. ix. 23.</NOTE>; But that <HI>he that glorieth should glory in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These Persons here spoken of, were all of them Leaders of Armies, except <HI>Sampson,</HI> who had the Force of an Army in himself: And we find they were as famous for their Faith, as for their Prowess. Doubtless they had many Soldiers in their Armies that had Faith as well as they; which gave <HI>them</HI> the same valorous martial Spirit that their Leaders had; and enabled them, in their Places, to act as valiantly in Battle, as their Leaders did in their's. <Q>Believing and praying Commanders, at the Head of be∣lieving and praying Armies, have been so owned and ho∣noured of God, that nothing can stand before them.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Observation</HI> from the Words, by divine Leave and Help to be spoken to, may be this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>That <HI>true Faith makes the best Soldiers, the most valiant and successful.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Day of War and Trouble in the Land.—When Enemies unjustly rise up against us, and do all the Mis∣chief they can, it is lawful and a Duty to take up Arms, and stand in our own Defence; yea, and to go forth to War against them. <HI>Good Soldiers,</HI> under God, are our Defence and Safety.—But what shall the People of God do for <HI>good Soldiers?</HI> What Method must be taken to make our Men such?—They who have the Honour to bear a Commission in the <HI>Militia,</HI> should doubtless take
<PB N="9" REF="006128_0007_1027F002DDF89798"/>
Pains to furnish themselves with a good Knowledge in military Affairs, and then, should be faithful in training their Companies; should make a Business of teaching their Men the right Use of the Gun and Sword, and whatever else is necessary for them to be acquainted with: And they should see to it, that their Soldiers under Arms, keep good Order, and attend to their Duty.—But when Men have perfected themselves in this Knowledge, they will be far from being good Soldiers, if they have not <HI>good Cou∣rage.</HI> This is absolutely necessary to make a Soldier. If a Man had a Body as bulky as <HI>Goliah'</HI>s, a Head as wife as <HI>Solomon'</HI>s, and an Arm as strong as <HI>Sampson'</HI>s, but a Heart like a <HI>Hare,</HI> Could this Man make a Soldier? What avail the large and branchy Horns of the <HI>Stagg,</HI> since he starts and runs at the Bark of a Dog? <HI>A Coward is no Soldier:</HI> He cannot keep Possession of his Soul, nor find his Hands, nor use his Arms, in the Time of Battle and Danger.</P>
<P>Men have invented and use a Variety of artificial Me∣thods to inspire themselves and one another with Courage: The Beat of Drums, the Blast of Trumpets, and Shouting for the Battle; these may somewhat rouse the Spirits, and breed a Kind of <HI>brutal</HI> Courage, a wild and mad Fury, like that of the <HI>War-Horse;</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Job. xxxix. 21,—</NOTE> <HI>who faith among the Trumpets, Ha, ha, goeth on to meet the armed Men, mocketh at Fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth back from the Sword; swalloweth the Ground with Fierceness and Rage,</HI> and rushes into the Battle. This is false Courage, purely a mecha∣nical Business: It hurries Men on precipitately into the Mouth of Danger, without Thought or Wit, Conside∣ration or Conduct; and often leaves them when they have the greatest Need. It degenerates into Fear and Cow∣ardise. It is a sudden Flush of the Spirits, which quickly goes off, like the <HI>Crackling of Thorns under a Pot,</HI> makes a great Noise and Blaze, but is soon over.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="006128_0008_1027F007FA2456A0"/>
<HI>True Valour,</HI> or Fortitude, is an excellent Vertue, the Mean between Temerity and Timerousness; as the Poet says,
<Q><L>—Courage dwells not in a troubled Flood</L>
<L>Of mounting Spirits, and fermenting Blood;</L>
<L>Lodg'd in the Soul with Virtue over-rul'd,</L>
<L>Inflam'd by Reason, and by Reason cool'd.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Addison's</HI> Campaign.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>It will not foolishly and needlesly run upon the Point of the Sword, or Muzzel of the Gun; nor will it thro' Fear neglect a Duty, nor quit a Post because of Danger. True Courage makes the Soldier patient in Labours, un∣wearied in Fight, compos'd in the utmost Confusion of Battle; bold and intrepid in the midst of Enemies. The Thunder of the Captains, Clashing of Swords, Roaring of Cannon, Shouts of Enemies, Groans of Friends, Clouds of Dust and Smoke, all the Terrors of War, do not in the least discourage him. The truly couragious Man will not presumptuously throw away his Life, nor sneekingly save it: He neither wishes for Death, nor fears it.</P>
<P>This manly rational Temper of Mind is not the Effect of Noise and Sounds only. Martial Instruments of Music may well be used: The <HI>Drum</HI> and <HI>Trumpet</HI> naturally tend to fire the Soul, work upon animal Nature, and breed a Kind of Courage; but as <HI>Paul</HI> said in another Case, <HI>I shew you a more excellent Way</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 31.</NOTE>; more rational and divine, more accommodate to us as Men and Christians.</P>
<P>True Courage will make Soldiers bold and daring, in∣spire them with the best Courage, most solid and lasting; such a Courage as will make them undaunted, not fearing the Force of their Adversaries; no, tho' they be like the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> of old, <HI>a bitter and hasty Nation, terrible and dreadful, of a fierce Countenance and hard Language.</HI> This will enable them to stand the Shock of Armies, and drive
<PB N="11" REF="006128_0009_1027F009897B2790"/>
home upon the Foe; and the more fierce and furious their Enemies are, the more will their Faith whet up their Courage, add Vigour to their Minds, and Strength to their Arms. This is the <HI>Wisdom</HI> that <HI>is better than Strength,</HI> yea <HI>than Weapons of War.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Eccl. ix. 16, 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>And Faith gives the best Assurance of <HI>Success.</HI> Success goes a great Way in establishing and aggrandizing the Sol∣dier's Character. Success indeed is not always a certain Evidence of the best Soldier. A most expert and valiant General, with an Army better disciplin'd, equip'd and posted, and consisting of more sturdy, resolute and bold Men, thro' some unforeseen Accident, some unexpected Turn of Providence, the Change of the Wind and Wea∣ther, may thro' their too great Boldness, and pursuing the Enemy too far, loose the Day: <HI>The Race is not</HI> always <HI>to the Swist, nor the Battle to the Strong; but Time and Chance happens to all.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chap. ix. 11.</NOTE> There is a secret, powerful, over∣ruling Providence, that determineth Events, quite cross to the natural Tendency of Things, and the rational Ex∣pectations of Men. But true Faith gives Soldiers the best Reason to hope they shall be prosper'd in all their Engage∣ments against their Enemies; and that the Event of the Battle, at least of the War, will be in their Favour.</P>
<P>Now that Faith makes the best Soldiers the most valiant and successful, we learn from the <HI>Heroes</HI> in the Text. By reading the History of their Wars, we find that they behaved valiantly in Fight; and that their Valour was crowned with Success. They fought with Armies vastly superiour to their own, in Respect of Numbers and mili∣tary Accoutrements; and yet their Enemies were not able to stand before them: Yea, <HI>Kings did flee away apace.</HI> From the Blood of the Slain, from the Fat of the Mighty, their Bow turned not back, nor did their Sword return
<PB N="12" REF="006128_0010_1027F00C71BBD790"/>
empty. They seldom or ever fought a <HI>Battle,</HI> but they gain'd a <HI>Victory.</HI></P>
<P>And so it was in <HI>After-times,</HI> when the Faith of God's People was strong and lively. What and how many nota∣ble <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctories did <HI>Judas Maccabaeus</HI> win over the Enemies of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People? The most puissant Armies were unable to grapple with the Valour of <HI>Judas</HI> and his Men, tho' vastly inferiour to them in Number and Arms<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Maccab. iii. 18,—</NOTE>. It was their Faith in God that gave them this Spirit, Courage and Success.</P>
<P>If we come down to <HI>later Times,</HI> we shall find Faith animating the Hearts of Christian Soldiers in the same Manner, and crowning them with Success. In the History of the Persecutions and Wars of the <HI>Waldenses</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fox'</HI>s Acts and Monuments.</NOTE>, a godly People, and full of Faith, we see how valiantly they de∣fended themselves from their Enemies, tho' they were but few in Number, and poorly furnished with Weapons of War; nay, and not only defended themselves, but ma∣ny Times drove their numerous and enraged Enemies be∣fore them. It was their Faith in God that made them thus valiant and victorious. They were good Soldiers of <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> valiant for the Truth; and God gave them a Spirit and Courage that all their Enemies were not able to withstand.</P>
<P>Should we come down to the <HI>Days and Wars of our Fore-fathers in this Country,</HI> we shall see the same Fruits of Faith? They were a holy praying Generation; Men of strong Faith, and eminent Piety: And their Faith gave them Courage against their numerous salvage Ene∣mies, and help'd them to the signal Victories they gain'd over them. We may say of them as <HI>David</HI> did of his Ancestors: <HI>Our Fathers trusted in thee: They trusted and thou didst deliver them. They cried unto thee and were de∣livered▪
<PB N="13" REF="006128_0011_1027F00E1C072FA8"/>
They trusted in thee and were not confounded</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxii. 4, 5.</NOTE>. Nay, so far from it, that they waxed valiant in Fight, and turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</P>
<P>And what was it made our Officers and Soldiers so va∣liant and victorious in the Siege of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> that strong and almost impregnable Fortress? Was it not Faith? Were not many good Men, Men of Faith and Prayer en∣gaged in it? Doubtless it would be a Wrong to their Faith, not to attribute their Courage and Success to that.</P>
<P>A small Army with great Faith, will do more than a great Army without Faith, tho' it have all necessary and convenient Weapons of War. This we have an Instance of in <HI>Abraham,</HI> that ancient renowned Believer; he with his Houshold Troops, <HI>three hundred and eighteen Men,</HI> ob∣tained a Victory over <HI>four Kings,</HI> who just before had pre∣vailed against <HI>five Kings</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gen. xiv. 14, 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>But <HI>what is this Faith that inspires Soldiers with such un∣common Courage, and crowns them with such Success?</HI></P>
<P>It is not a vain presumptuous Confidence, a groundless enthusiastic Perswasion, arising in the Mind from an over∣weening Conceit of our own Goodness, and of our peculiar Interest in the special Love of God: It is not any sudden unaccountable Impression and Impulse upon the Mind, that God will infallibly defend us, and destroy our Enemies. It is no proud vapouring Imagination, nor Satanic Delu∣sion.—No:</P>
<P>This Faith is a rational Thing: A divine Principle wrought in the Soul by the Spirit of God.</P>
<P><HI>It is a firm and undoubted Belief of the Being and Per∣fections of God</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Context v. 6.</NOTE>, and in particular, of his Wisdom, Good∣ness,
<PB N="14" REF="006128_0012_1027F01339D413C0"/>
Justice and Power: <HI>It is a full Perswasion of the Providence of God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Context Ver. 6.</NOTE>: That he orders and over-rules all the Affairs of the World; holds all Men and Things in his Hands; can curb and restrain, weaken or strengthen, de∣liver or destroy them, just as he pleases: And that he is righteous in all the Administrations of Providence; and that therefore, when his People appeal to him by War, he will decide the Cause according to Justice. This Way more especially the Faith of <HI>Jephthah</HI> wro't. <HI>I have not finned against thee,</HI> said he to his Enemies, <HI>but thou dost me Wrong to War against me: The Lord the Judge be Judge this Day between the Children of</HI> Israel <HI>and the Children of</HI> Ammon<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Judg. xi. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>It is a hearty Reliance upon the Promises of God</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 13.</NOTE>: A Belief that God is sincere in making them, is able to make them good<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ver. 19.</NOTE>, and will not suffer his Faithfulness to fail. The Faith of <HI>Gideon, Barak</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> had a more special Reference to the Promises God made them. God promised <HI>Barak,</HI> that he would deliver <HI>Sisera</HI> and his Army into his Hand<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Chap. iv. 7.</NOTE>; and <HI>Gideon,</HI> that <HI>he would surely be with him, and that he should smite the</HI> Midianites <HI>as one Man</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Chap. vi. 16.</NOTE>. And <HI>David</HI> had many Promises made to him, that God would be with him and prosper him. These good Men embraced these divine Promises; and tho' there was some Weakness in their Faith at first receiving them, they after∣ward most firmly relied on them.—</P>
<P><HI>It is a fiducial Dependance upon God as our God in Co∣venant</HI><NOTE N="||||" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; who hath taken us near to himself, and thro' <HI>Christ</HI> is reconciled to us.</P>
<P><HI>It is a dutiful Acknowledgment of God in all our Ways</HI><NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Ver. 27.</NOTE>; lifting up our Eyes, and Hearts, and Cries to God for
<PB N="15" REF="006128_0013_1027F014C813B020"/>
Direction, Protection and Success. In this Way the Faith of good <HI>Hezekiah</HI> express'd itself<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xix. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>It is the Root and Principle of all holy Obedience</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Context Ver. 8.</NOTE>; in∣fluences to all holy Living; brings into Subjection to God's Law, and makes willing and careful to follow his Orders: <HI>It produces an entire Resignation to the Will of God in his Providence,</HI> that he may do as seemeth him good.</P>
<P><HI>It shews itself by Works</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ver. 7.</NOTE>: Puts upon using the most apt Means and best Endeavours for Self-preservation and De∣fence, and for annoying and repelling an Enemy; as if all depended upon our own Skill and Strength, Courage and Conduct; still looking up to God, and depending entirely upon him for his Blessing upon all.</P>
<P>In a Word, <HI>It is a realizing View of another World</HI><NOTE N="sect;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 1.</NOTE>, looks more to the Things that are not seen, and that are eternal, than to transitory visible Things<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ver. 10.</NOTE>: And carries the Soul out in earnest Desires after them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 16.</NOTE>, and diligent Pre∣parations for them.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>Faith</HI> which makes the best Soldiers; and the stronger and more lively this Faith is, the more will it animate their Courage, and encrease their Hope of Success.—</P>
<P>But <HI>Whence is it that Faith hath this Vertue and Influ∣ence, to inspire Solders with the best Courage, and assure them of Success?</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is partly from the Divine Sovereignty.</HI> Faith is a Grace that most honours God: It is a Dependence upon him alone; a practical and professed Acknowledgment of our own Insufficiency, and of his Power and Goodness, that
<PB N="16" REF="006128_0014_1027F017726A20C0"/>
he is willing and able to help his People. <HI>This</HI> is pleasing to God, and from his sovereign Goodness he gives his People the Comfort of that which gives him Honour. Having by his Spirit stirred up the Faith of his Servants, he doth by the same Spirit stir up their Courage. After <HI>Jophthah'</HI>s believing Appeal to God as Judge, it is said, <HI>Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon him</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Judg. xi. 29.</NOTE>: A martial Spirit, a Spirit that did in an uncommon Manner fire him with Courage and Zeal against the Enemies of the Lord's Peo∣ple. God delights in the Faith of his People, and from his sovereign rich Goodness, will not let it go unrewarded. <HI>When a Man's Ways please the Lord,</HI> and this Way of Faith always doth, <HI>He maketh his Enemies to be at Peace with him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 7.</NOTE>, or yield to him, or fall before him.</P>
<P><HI>It is partly from the Nature of Faith. Faith possesses the Soul with a sacred Dread of this great God;</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Context Ver. 7.</NOTE> a Reverence of his Majesty and Greatness; a Fear of doing any Thing unworthy of him, unbecoming our Relation to him, and displeasing to his Holiness: It makes us careful to observe his Laws, follow the Steps of Providence, and yield to the Motions of his Spirit. It represents God to the Soul, in the Glory of his Perfections and Operations; and causes us to <HI>sactify the Lord of Hosts, and to make him our Fear, and our Dread</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isai. viii. 12, 13.</NOTE>: And when we do this <HI>we shall not fear nor be afraid of Man.</HI> A Soul possess'd with a holy Fear of God, is elevated above the slavish Fear of Man. As the Light of the Sun extinguishes the Light of a Candle, yea of the brightest Stars; so doth the Fear of God drive out the undue Fear of Men, the highest and greatest. They that fear God, will not fear them that can kill the Body, and after that can do no more, unless abuse and disgrace the Carcass. The Fear of Man is weakening to the Body and Mind, preys upon the Spirits, and makes cowardly; but the Fear of God has a quite contrary Effect, <HI>The
<PB N="17" REF="006128_0015_1027F01903D73338"/>
Righteous is bold as a Lion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxviii. 1.</NOTE>; nothing can terrify them. The fiercest Enemies, most cruel Threatnings, and Death it self in the most frightful Forms, no Ways dismay them. A notable Instance of this we have in the <HI>three jewish Wor∣thies:</HI> They would not be frightned from their God and their Duty, by the stern Looks, furious Threats, and fla∣ming Furnace of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> that Terror of the Mighty.</P>
<P><HI>Faith represents the Enemies of God's People in a dimi∣nishing Light.</HI> Unbelief and carnal Fear are apt to mag∣nify them. As, They are so numerous, so expert in their Discipline, so well furnish'd with all Kinds of Wea∣pons, and withal, as they are such mighty Men, and are en∣raged; and we, compared with them, are few in Num∣ber, poor and unprovided, have no Might nor Strength. But Faith gives God's People quite another View and Account of them, diminishes them as much as Sense and Unbelief magnified them. The unbelieving <HI>Spies</HI> made Report of the Inhabitants of <HI>Canaan,</HI> That <HI>all the People that they saw in it were Men of great Stature: And there they saw the Giants the Sons of</HI> Anak, <HI>and that they were in their own Sight as Grashoppers, and such in their Sight</HI> too<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Numb. xiii. 32, 33.</NOTE>: Little, weak, contemptible Insects. But the Faith of <HI>Joshua</HI> and <HI>Caleb,</HI> two of that Number of Spies, beheld them in a quite different Light; made no Account of them, and reported of them as not at all to be fear'd: <HI>They are Bread for us</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiv. 9.</NOTE>, say they: Not <HI>Corn,</HI> that will take some Time and Trouble to prepare it for Food: But <HI>Bread,</HI> ground, made up, bak'd, ready to eat: They are set before us, rather to be fed upon, than to be fought with. Where Faith thus lessens Enemies, it will raise and keep up the Soldiers Courage in fighting with them. Whatever mighty Shews their Enemies make, how for∣midable soever they appear in Battle-array, and how loud and threatening soever their Words may be, Faith shews
<PB N="18" REF="006128_0016_1027F01E331CABC8"/>
them, That <HI>they are Men and not God, and their Horses Flesh and not Spirit;</HI> weak and mortal Creatures. Over∣rating an Enemy breeds Discouragement, damps the Spirits, and awakens Fear: But seeing them by the Eyes of Faith diminished to almost nothing, strengthens the feeble Knees, raises up the Hands that hang down, and recovers the fainting Spirits.</P>
<P>Carnal Soldiers many times make Use of something like this to to fortify their Minds, and keep up their Spirits. They endeavour to think meanly of their Enemies, and they speak contemptibly of them, as having neither Skill nor Valour; But Faith does this most satifyingly to the Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Faith excites a mighty Spirit of Prayer.</HI> Faith and Prayer ever go together; and the stronger Faith is, the more fervent is Prayer. Believing Soldiers know they can call in the Help of God, when Things are come to the last Extremity, and are in such a desperate Situation, that vain is the Help of Man. And they hope, that the God who hears Prayers, and delights in the Prayers of Faith, will some Way appear for them, open some Way of E∣scape, and preserve them from the Rage and Cruelty of their Enemies. Believing Soldiers can wrestle with God, at the same Time they are combating with Men: They can shoot up their Prayers to God in the Heavens, while they are discharging their Shot upon the Enemy in the Field. This is a mighty Support to their Spirits, and begets in them a holy Confidence in God; in that they know, that where God gives a Spirit of Prayer, he is not wont to deny his People the Mercy they have pray'd unto him for. They know, that fervent believing Prayer can do more and greater Execution than Guns and Swords. <HI>These</HI> have Power with God, and prevail: And rather than the Enemy should prevail against an Army of Prayers, God will bow the Heavens and come down, fly upon the Wings of the Wind for their Help; muster up the
<PB N="19" REF="006128_0017_1027F01FC2084380"/>
Militia of Heaven, discharge his Artillery upon their Ene∣mies, thunder in the Heavens, shoot out his Lightnings, and send down Hailstones, and the great Rain of his Strength. Oh what Courage must this give praying be∣lieving Soldiers, who have a God of infinite Power and Goodness to cry unto in their Distresses! a God with whom <HI>inwrought fervent Prayers avail much;</HI> and who <HI>never said to the Seed of</HI> praying wrestling Jacob, <HI>seek ye me in vain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Faith engages and realizes the gracious Presence of God with his fighting People.</HI> It <HI>engages</HI> the Presence of God with them. God has promised his People to be with them in their Difficulties and Dangers. Faith lays hold of the Promise, and pleads it with God: And while the belie∣ving Soul doth this, God will not leave him nor forsake him. By Faith in the Promise, the Believer has a fast Hold upon God, and God will not rend away from him. <HI>The Lord is with his People,</HI> in a Way of Grace and Fa∣vour, <HI>while they are with him,</HI> in the Way of Faith and Duty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xv. 2.</NOTE>.—And Faith <HI>realizes</HI> the gracious Presence of God with them: That he goes forth with their Armies, accompanies them in the Field of Battle, beholds the Num∣ber, Force and Rage of their Enemies, and <HI>their</HI> Weak∣ness and Dependance upon him. And besides, <HI>Faith</HI> realizes, that God is not present with them only as an unconcern'd Spectator, but stands ready to help them in all that they need, and call upon him for: To guide their Counsels, cover their Heads, direct their Shot, strengthen their Hearts and Hands, and fight for them by his Power and Provi∣dence.</P>
<P>Surely this will kindle the Fire in every Soldier's Breast, give Life and Spirit, and strengthen with all Might.—<HI>If God be for us, who can be against us</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 31.</NOTE>? If God fight for us, who can prosper that fight against us? When <HI>David</HI>

<P>The Presence of God with his People was always e∣steemed a sufficient Reason for fortifying their Minds a∣gainst their Enemies. God himself uses this as an Ar∣gument for their Courage. <HI>I will be with thee, I will not fail thee nor forsake thee,</HI> said he to <HI>Joshua;</HI> therefore, <HI>be strong, and of a good Courage</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Josh. i. 5, 6.</NOTE>.

And Reason good this, to make God's believing People strong, and of a good Courage: For God <HI>with</HI> and <HI>for</HI> his People, is more than all the World against them: And with this good <HI>Hezekiah</HI> en∣couraged himself and his People, when invaded by the vast and insulting Army of <HI>Sennacherib: Be strong and coura∣gious, be not afraid nor dismayed for the King of</HI> Assyria, <HI>nor for all the Multitude that is with him: For there be more with us, than with him. With him is an Arm of Flesh, but with us is the Lord our God, to help us, and to fight our Battles</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxxii. 7, 8.</NOTE>. How greatly, will the Presence of a valiant, politic, experienced, successful General, inspire his Soldiers with Resolution and Courage? Who would not fight bravely, and play the Men, in the Presence and Sight, and under the Conduct of our illustrious Prince WILLIAM Duke of <HI>Cumberland?</HI> But surely, it must much more raise the Spirits, and sharpen the Courage of the Christian Soldiers, when by Faith they behold GOD himself going with them, conducting them, and fighting for them.—</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="006128_0019_1027F025B5CE7D88"/>
<HI>Faith sees the Glory of God much interested in the Wars of his People:</HI> And this fires them with Zeal and Cou∣rage. God's Glory lies nearer the Hearts of his People, than any of their own Interests; and they will venture harder to secure, defend, and vindicate that, than any Thing of their own. In this Case they will not' count their Lives dear to them, nor love them to the Death.</P>
<P>One Thing that very much contributes to lead Soldiers on to gallant and brave Actions in Fight, is <HI>the Honour of their King and Country:</HI> For the Honour of their Prince, they will behave with the utmost Resolution and Obstina∣cy. Surely the Honour of God will as much sway with the believing Soldier, in fighting the Lord's Battles. Should the Enemy prevail, what would God do for his great Name? What would the blasphemous <HI>AEgyptians</HI> say? And therefore to prevent their blasphemous Reproaches, the Christian Soldier is willing to jeopard his Life, and spend his Blood. It is not so much for the Honour of his <HI>King</HI> (tho' this is dear to him) as of his GOD, that he fights. It is the Cause of God, and Religion, and his People, he is fighting for: And the Tho't of this adds Vigour to his Spirit, and Force to his Arms. It was the Sense of this that stirred up <HI>David's</HI> Spirit, and em∣bolden'd him to enter the Lists with enormous <HI>Goliah: He defied the Armies of the living God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xvii. 36.</NOTE>; and thereby vir∣tually <HI>defied the living God,</HI> Israel'<HI>s God, the God of Armies. David's</HI> Zeal for God's Glory armed him with Resolution to undertake the Fight, and his Faith bro't him off a Conqueror.</P>
<P><HI>Faith commits the Body and Soul, and all their Concerns into the Hands of God.</HI> It puts over all that we are and have unto God, for him to look after, take Care of, and dispose of, just as he pleases. It is the Property and Pri∣viledge of Faith, to devolve all our Cares and Concerns
<PB N="22" REF="006128_0020_1027F0298A67C1E0"/>
upon God; to cast our Burdens on him, and commit the Keeping of our Souls to him. And Faith knows that God's Hands are safe, powerful, and merciful Hands: That he is able to keep what we have committed to him. Now what has that Soldier to fear, who hath lodged all that he hath in such glorious Hands? He knows his E∣nemies can have no Power against him, except it be given them from above: That not an Hair of his Head can fall to the Ground, much less a Drop of his Blood, or his Life, without the Will of his heavenly Father: And that God will give them no more Power against him, than shall be most for his Glory. He knows God can sustain him under the greatest Burdens, deliver him in the most imminent Dangers, and preserve him untouch'd, unhurt in the midst of Swords, Shot and Deaths. Such a belie∣ving Soldier hath nothing to terrify him, nothing to be careful about; but to keep in the Way of Duty, and leave the Event to God. He can address his Fellow-Sol∣diers, and urge them on to the Fight, as <HI>Joah</HI> that famous General in <HI>Israel</HI> did; <HI>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and for the Cities of our God: And the Lord do that which seemesh him good</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. x. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Faith calls fresh to Mind, and feeds upon, the wonderful Appearances of God for his People in Times past, against their Enemies;</HI> and takes Courage from thence, with Respect to present Engagements: And more especially doth it thus, when the People of God are bro't into the same Mounts of Difficulty, Distress, and Danger that God's People were in in former Generations. Then it <HI>remembers the Years of the right Hand of the Most High,</HI> and encourages the believing Soul to hope for the same almighty Power to de∣fend and strengthen him, the same unerring Wisdom to conduct him, and the same rich Goodness to supply him. It is said, <HI>Thou breakest the Heads of Leviathan in Pieces, and gavest him to be Meet to the People inhabiting the
<PB N="23" REF="006128_0021_1027F02B121E6998"/>
Wilderness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxiv. 14.</NOTE>. They fed their Souls with the Sweetness of this Mercy. <Q>This Providence was meat to their Faith and Hope, to support and comfort them in Re∣ference to the other Difficulties, they were likely to meet with in the Wilderness.</Q></P>
<P>Carnal old Soldiers are wont to keep up their Courage, by recounting how many Wars they have served in; how many Battles they have fought; what Dangers they have been in; what Wounds they have received; what narrow Escapes they have made with their Lives; and how ma∣ny Victories they have won: The Remembrance of these Things inspires them with fresh Courage. But the Act∣ings of Faith upon God's Works of Power and Mercy for his People, will do it much better. How mightily will this embolden the Soldier's Spirit, when his Faith assures him, that <HI>this God of Salvation</HI> is the same God that ever he was; that his Arm is not shortned, nor his Love abated. Oh, to believe, that as God hath delivered his People, and doth still deliver them, he will yet deliver them.—Once more,</P>
<P>Finally;</P>
<P><HI>Faith looks to the Glory and Blessedness of the unseen eternal World;</HI> and this administers Courage. <HI>Faith is the Evi∣dence of Things not seen</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Context Ver. 1.</NOTE>: It gives a realizing presentiating View of another World, and of the great Good that is laid up for Believers there: And it begets a good Hope of coming to the Enjoyment of it, whenever God shall call out of this World; yea, and sometimes it enables the Christian to see his Title to it: It rises up to <HI>the Riches of the full Assurance of Faith and Hope.</HI> The Christian thus rais'd in the Actings of Faith and Hope, has nothing to terrify him: He can with the greatest Presence of Mind, and unshaken Fortitude of Soul, rush into the midst of E∣nemies and Danger, when Duty calls him. Death is no
<PB N="24" REF="006128_0022_1027F02DB79C9280"/>
Terror to him. When there is nothing but Blood and Death around him, his Heart is undaunted, because his Faith shews him a Crown of Life and Glory reserved in the Heavens for him.</P>
<P>Carnal Soldiers look for only some temporal Reward, a Garland of Flowers, a little higher Post, a more honourable Commission; or to enrich themselves with the Spoil of the Enemy, or, if they fall in Battle, to have it said of them, <HI>They died in the Bed of Honour.</HI> These are sorry trifling Considerations, and yet they serve mightily to embolden them in Fight. But surely, if Soldiers will make such ad∣ventrous and desperate Pushes on the Enemy, only for a <HI>corruptible Crown,</HI> the Honour that comes from Men; the Christian Soldier's Faith will urge him on to do so, for an <HI>Incorruptible.</HI> He that by Faith knows, that if he looses his Life on Earth, fighting the Cause of God and his Peo∣ple, he shall win a Crown in Heaven, <HI>a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory,</HI> will not <HI>count his Life dear to him.</HI> He that fights, and keeps Heaven in his Eye, will not want Courage. This Faith, which has render'd <HI>Mar∣tyrs</HI> patient and joyful in the midst of Flames, will make Soldiers so in the most dreadful Scenes of War.</P>
<P>Thus Faith gives Soldiers the best Courage. And as I said before, the more lively and strong the Actings of Faith are, the more and better is the Courage.</P>
<P>And Faith makes <HI>successful</HI> Soldiers too. We find it so in the many Instances upon sacred Record. God's People always won the Day when they fought in Faith.—They who are the best, most skilful and courageous Generals, and have been very successful, yet sometimes meet with a Discomfiture, loose the Day, and quit the Field: But Faith ever prevails. This calls in, and engages God and his Providence to fight for his People. And tho' God do not now <HI>miraculously</HI> interpose for his People, yet he so orders Matters in Providence, as to accomplish Success for them,
<PB N="25" REF="006128_0023_1027F0302E485BB0"/>
as surely, as if it was bro't about by apparent Miracles. The Finger of God is very visible in it; the Arm of the Lord is made bare; his almighty Power discovered, to the Admiration and Joy of his own People, and to the Asto∣nishment and Ruin of their Enemies. God so orders Things in Providence, that at the very Instant of Time, when his People stand in need of Help from him, they re∣ceive it: And tho' it be not purely <HI>a miraculous Interposition</HI> of Providence, it is a very <HI>extraordinary</HI> and remarkable one; and was to them according to their Faith: They be∣lieved in God, that he would appear for them, but in which Way they knew not: And when; as to all outward Means they could look to, all Hope perished, then <HI>in the Mount it has been seen.</HI> It were easy to produce many In∣stances to prove this, were it needful.—Was it not by this signal Interposition of Providence, in Answer to Faith and Prayer, that God in former Times delivered the <HI>En∣glish Nation</HI> from the <HI>Spanish Invasion?</HI> Was it not from the special Appearances of God for his People of <HI>New-England,</HI> by causing <HI>strong Winds to fulfil his Word,</HI> and by sending wasting Sickness among them, that we were of very late Time delivered from the <HI>French Fleet</HI> that came into these <HI>Northern</HI> Seas, with Orders to make all desolate that they could come at? And was it not the signal Provi∣dence of God that succeeded our Siege of <HI>Louisbourgh;</HI> wonderfully changing the usual Course of the Winter, both <HI>here,</HI> in preparing for it, and <HI>there,</HI> in fighting against it, 'till it was surrendred, and <HI>not a Day longer.</HI> This Success and Salvation God gave his People in Answer to their Faith and Prayer. God never disappoints the well-groun∣ded, well regulated, and well-experienced Faith of his People.</P>

the Day of Battle and War.</HI> God hath these Trea∣sures to bring in the Day of Battle and War: With them he fights against sinful Men. And, as Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> notes upon the Place, <Q>Sometimes they come so oppor∣tunely to serve the Purposes of Providence, in God's fighting for his People, and against their Enemies, that one would think, they were laid up as Magazines or Stores of Arms, and Ammunition, and Provision against the Time of Trouble, and the Day of Battle.</Q></P>
<P>Faith is a prevailing Thing with God: It takes hold of God's Strength, and like <HI>Jacob,</HI> if I may be allow'd the Expression, <Q>Closes in with God, and refuses to let him go without a Blessing, a Deliverance from <HI>Esau,</HI> an en∣raged Enemy.</Q> Indeed Faith will obtain almost every Thing from God. The Prayer of Faith avails much: Who can say how much? God saith to it, <HI>Concerning the Work of my Hands, command ye me</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xlv. 11.</NOTE>. <HI>Be it unto thee even as thou will</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. xv. 28.</NOTE>.

<P><HI>Victory is of the Lord</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxi. 31.</NOTE>: And to whom will he give it, if not to his own believing fighting People?

Be their Walls as high as those of <HI>Jericho,</HI> as thick and strong as those of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and defended with Towers and Batteries; down they must come, when Faith engages them; or the Gates of Iron and Brass must fly open. The strongest Armies must flee or fall before Faith. This makes the People of God in∣vincible, and victorious.</P>

The Faith of God's People is as pleasing and honorary to God now, as then, and will as surely engage God on their Side. When God's People fight against their Enemies by Faith and Prayer, God will fight against them too by his Power and Providence: Not a Man shall be able to stand against them: Either they must run, or be ruined.—</P>
<P><HI>Should not this stir up Gentlemen of the military Life and Order, to get and exercise this Faith,</HI> which makes the best Soldiers, the most valiant and victorious. Especially since Valour and Victory are their greatest Glory.—Perhaps an Exhortation to it may be deemed by them foolish and ridiculous.—Alas, the generality of Soldiers, 'tis to be feared, are of that Character, <HI>Unreasonable and wicked Men, that have not Faith</HI><NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">2 Thes. iii. 2.</NOTE>: That have not God in all their Tho'ts; living, acting, fighting in the World without God: That have no Fear of God in their Hearts: That call not upon his Name, unless in a Way of horrible Cur∣sing and Swearing: That have no Reverence for his Word, nor Regard to any of the Operations of his Hands and Providence. Yea, may it not be justly feared, that many of them are such <HI>Fools</HI> as to <HI>say in their Hearts, There is no God,</HI> no Providence, no Heaven, nor Hell? Are they not generally Men that trifle with the most solemn and im∣portant
<PB N="28" REF="006128_0026_1027F0399C16DF48"/>
Things, and make a Mock of all that is sacred? Such <HI>Gentlemen Soldiers</HI> would doubtless take in Disdain this Kind of Exhortation; make it the Subject of their Mirth and Railery; and condemn the Preacher for a dull <HI>Phonetic,</HI> that would make them <HI>Enthusiasts</HI> and <HI>Madmen,</HI> rather than accomplish'd Soldiers.</P>
<P>Soldiers of this Stamp think <HI>Religion</HI> makes Men <HI>Cow∣ards:</HI> That a Man will never make a gallant, brave, bold Fellow in the Army, 'till he has thrown off all Veneration for the <HI>Deity,</HI> and all Regard to <HI>Religion:</HI> That he will never dare to look his Enemies in the Face, unless he be so horridly impious as to fly in the Face of his Maker; nor to storm a City, or enter a Breach, 'till he storm Heaven itself, with his horrid Imprecations, and blasphe∣mous Oaths. All they desire is, to have good Guns and Swords; a good General, a well disciplin'd Army, and compleat Artillery; and then, shew them their Enemies. They trust in their own Bow, their Swords, Guns, Bombs, Cannon, Ships and Horses, because they are many: They trust in their own Prowess and Policy, Strength and Con∣duct, and what, in an heathenish Manner, they call, their <HI>Good Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>An Army made up of such Men, has no true Courage in it. They may be ventrous and fool-hardy, but not truly valiant. True Courage is founded in Reason, and tem∣pered and guided by Prudence; and is as different and distant from Rashness and Fury, as Reason is from Phrensy, or Religion from enthusiastic Wildness. The Courage of such Men, such as it is, arises from their Inconsideration, Infidelity, Ignorance, Pride and Arrogance; or from their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; or from an unmanly cruel Disposition, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> delights in Blood and Slaughter.</P>

Courage, and drink up their Spirits. Should God display the Tokens of his Wrath in the Works of Providence; Should God look upon their Hearts, as he did upon the Host of the <HI>AEgyptians,</HI> they would be as much troubled and terrified as the <HI>AEgyptians</HI> were; and like <HI>Belshazzer,</HI> their Countenances would change, their Tho'ts trouble them, the Joints of their Loins be loosed, and their Knees smite against each other. Their mighty Men would go into the Holes of the Rocks, and into the Caves of the Earth for fear of the Lord, and for the Glory of his Ma∣jesty. Yea, these great Men, and chief Captains, and mighty Men, would cry to the Mountains and Rocks to fall on them. Fear and the Pit would be before them; and Destruction from the Lord be a Terror to them.—<HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>The Wicked flee when no Man pursueth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxviii. 1.</NOTE>.

<P>But,</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Artillery,</HI> I am perswaded better▪ Things of you, Things that accompany Salvation.

Since you see how excellent and neces∣sary a Qualification Faith is for a Soldier, you will be de∣sirous of it, that you may become Soldiers, the best of Soldiers.—</P>
<P>Doubtless, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> You are expert in War. Your Genius, Calling, Studies and frequent Exercises, have no doubt accomplish'd you in military Skill: And the honou∣rable <HI>Commissions</HI> which many of you bear under his <HI>Excel∣lency;</HI>

have no doubt quickened your Ambition to cultivate your martial Disposition, and excell in military Know∣ledge; especially since our <HI>Captain General</HI> has discovered such a martial Spirit and Zeal against our Enemies, in ad∣vising and promoting an Expedition against them at <HI>Cape∣Breton;</HI> which God wonderfully succeeded:—Is still pro∣moting another against our Enemies at <HI>Crown Point:</HI> Com∣missions under such a Governour should make you industri∣ous and ambitious of being good Soldiers. The honoura∣ble Example of the Governour should be a strong Argu∣ment hereto. You understand the Beat of the Drum and the Exercise of all your Arms; can keep Rank and File; know how to advance and retreat, and can perform the various military Figures.</P>
<P>Doubtless you have a natural Fortitude of Mind, a noble Valiantness of Soul: But yet, if you would be <HI>Heroes,</HI> to all your other military Accomplishments, you must add <HI>Faith:</HI> Whatever other Qualifications you have, and in how great Perfection soever, if you have not Faith, <HI>One Thing is lacking,</HI> yea, the <HI>chief Thing;</HI> that which will in∣spire you with the best Courage, and give you the surest Success.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> You know that a holy God, for the provo∣king Sins among us, hath bro't <HI>War</HI> into our Borders. The Sword of the Wilderness is drawn against us, and making Havock in our inland Frontiers. And you cannot but remember the Designs and Attempts of the <HI>French</HI> against us by Sea; and what an Alarm and Consternation it threw the Country into. How soon God may send such Num∣bers of Enemies against us, as may call <HI>you</HI> into the Field of Battle, to jeopard your Lives in fighting for our God, and for the Cities of our God, none can tell.—Still Ini∣quity abounds in the Midst of us.—We have indeed had a great Shew of Religion in the Land, and I hope it hath not been a <HI>meer Shew.</HI> But for all, Are we not an hypocritical People? and for that Reason the People of

God's Wrath, who therefore makes the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> the Rod of his Anger, and gives them a Charge to take the Spoil, and take the Prey. Now tho', we hope, God will, in the midst of Judgment, remember Mercy for us, yet we may not expect it in a <HI>miraculous</HI> Way. We must not think to do as <HI>Israel</HI> of old were ordered, <HI>Stand still, and see the Salvation of God;</HI> doing nothing ourselves. No: We must be up and doing, working and fighting for our Lives: We must play the Men for our Religion and People; for our Churches and Country. Surely it behoves you, <HI>You,</HI> Sirs, especially upon whom our Eyes are for Leaders in a Day of Battle, to be thoro'ly versed in the Art of War, and to have all those Qualifications that may render you the most finish'd Officers and Soldiers. If you would prove <HI>valiant in Fight, and turn the Armies of the A∣lient to Flight,</HI> you must <HI>add to your Knowledge, Vertue; and to Vertue,</HI> Faith: This will make your Courage of the right <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

Without this you cannot hope, upon any <HI>Scripture</HI> Grounds, to do any thing against them, to Purpose; nay, you have Reason to fear, whether God will not send his Terrors into you, and cause your <HI>Hearts to be moved, as the Trees of the Wood are moved by the mighty Wind;</HI> to be per∣plexed and confounded in your Counsels, tost and shaken out of the Possession of your Souls.</P>
<P>Oh then, <HI>Have Faith in God.</HI> Believe his Word, and ye shall be established: Settle your Hearts in the Belief of his governing Providence: That he who concerns himself in the least Things that befall a <HI>Person,</HI> is much more con∣cerned in the great Affairs of <HI>his People,</HI> where Religion, and the Interests of <HI>Christ's</HI> Kingdom, are much depending. Raise your Faith to the Promises of the Word; and lay hold of them for your Establishment and Support. Clear

up your Interest in the Blessings of the Redeemer's Purchase; and labour for the full Assurance of Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Live in the Exercise of Faith.</HI> Faith is for daily Use; and by exercising, it grows. And especially, live in the lively Exercise of it <HI>in these Times,</HI> as <HI>that,</HI> which will truly spirit you to go out against the Enemy, should you be called to it; and which will keep up your Spirits in all the Fa∣tigues and Dangers of War. To believe and know, that you are called of God, and have his gracious Presence with you, his glorious Perfections to shield you, his Providence to guard you, his Spirit to lead you, and his Angels to en∣camp about you; Oh, how would this elevate your Spirits, and invigorate your Minds. You might then sing in those Strains of Faith; <HI>God is in the midst of us, we shall not be moved: God shall help us, and that right early: The Lord of Hosts is with us; the God of</HI> Jacob <HI>is our Refuge: He break∣eth the Bow, and cutteth the Spear in sunder: He burneth the Chariot in the Fire</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlvi. 5, 7, 9.</NOTE>. <HI>The Horse and his Rider hath he thrown to the Ground.</HI> If <HI>in the Name of God,</HI> and Faith in that Name, <HI>you set up your Banners, the Lord will hear you in the Day of Trouble; the Name of the God of</HI> Jacob <HI>will de∣fend you. He will send you Help from the Sanctuary, and strengthen you out of</HI> Zion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. xx. 5, 1, 2.</NOTE>. He will cover your Heads in the Day of Battle, and preserve your Souls alive. Nay he will not only defend you, but give you Success against your Enemies; put them to the Rout, and make them flee be∣fore you. If you should be in any pressing Dangers, he would <HI>ride upon the Heavens for your Help, and in his Excel∣lency upon the Sky.</HI>—Oh, <HI>Blessed is that Man whose God is the Lord!</HI> Blessed is that Army that takes God into the Field with them against their Enemies. Rather than they should not prevail, he would take the Work into his own Hands: <HI>His right Hand would dash the Enemy in Pieces: His right Hand and holy Arm would get them the Victory.</HI></P>

But because the Sword devours one as well as another, and a good Man, full of Faith and of the Holy Ghost, may fall in Battle; consider, if he doth, he not only dies in the <HI>Bed of Honour,</HI> as Men call it; but he <HI>dies in Peace,</HI> as godly <HI>Josiah</HI> did, who was slain in Battle. He is only sent to Heaven an easier Way, than by languishing Sickness; and a little sooner than, it seems, he otherwise might have been. He enters into Peace, and wings away to that World, where God makes Peace in his high Places, where Love reigns in every Breast, where he shall no more hear the confused Noise of the Warriour, nor see Garments roll'd in Blood. His Warfare is accomplish'd: He puts off his Harness, lays by his Gun and Sword, and Soldier's Apparel and Apparatus, is cloathed in a white Robe, and a Palm is put into his Hand. Yea, he is gone to that blessed World, where he finds himself out of the Reach of his <HI>spiritual</HI> Ene∣mies, and hath no Occasion to combat with them any more.</P>
<P>See now the Excellency and Usefulness of Faith, in ma∣naging the Wars of the Lord. What <HI>David</HI> said of the Sword of <HI>Goliah, There is none like it</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xxi. 9.</NOTE>; I may say of Faith, there is no military Qualification like it; and must advise you, as blessed <HI>Paul</HI> doth of the <HI>spiritual Armour, Above all take the Shield of Faith</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 16.</NOTE>. Leave nothing untried to gain a good Understanding in the Art and Affairs of War: This you must have, or you cannot fight in Faith; and ha∣ving this, suffer me to put an <HI>Above all,</HI> to Faith.</P>
<P>Surely, <HI>Christian</HI> Soldiers should have something to diffe∣rence them from Heathens and Idolators. And what can it be, if not their Faith? Our Enemies have Swords, Guns, and Hatchets, as well as we: They have been trained up to fight in their Way, as well as we in our's; and are as dextrous in it. Yea and they invocate their Gods and Saints to help them, and depend upon their Help. And shall not <HI>Christian</HI> Soldiers do one Thing more than they?
<PB N="34" REF="006128_0032_1027D961EEB92A98"/>
Especially when they have a God, who invites their Trust in him, is pleased with it, and accounts himself glorified by it.</P>
<P><HI>Honoured Sirs,</HI> Labour to get such a Faith in God, thro' Christ; that if you should be called to go forth against, and meet and fight your Enemies, you may be able to address them as <HI>David,</HI> that religious young <HI>Hero,</HI> did <HI>Goliah, Thou comest to me with a Sword, and with a Spear; but I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of Hosts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xvii. 45.</NOTE>: And to give that believing Shout, that <HI>Gideon</HI> and his Soldiers did, <HI>The Sword of the Lord, and of</HI> Gideon<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Judg. vii. 20.</NOTE>: The Sword of the Lord, and of his People.—Oh what a Damp would this strike to the Enemy, and what a Presence of Mind, and Fortitude of Soul, would it give to yourselves!</P>
<P>But, Whatever your Thoughts may be of the Use and Excellency of Faith, in managing War with your Fellow∣Mortals; yet there are <HI>other Enemies</HI> that you, and all of us, have to fight with: <HI>For we wrestle, not</HI> only against <HI>Flesh and Blood; but against Principalities, and Powers, and the Rulers of the Darkness of this World, and spiritual Wickednesses</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 12.</NOTE>. And there is no carrying on the War valiantly and success∣fully with these, without Faith. The Devil, with his Le∣gions, in Confederacy with our own Lusts, are warring a∣gainst our Souls: He lays his Snares for us, shoots his fiery Darts at us, and makes the most violent Assaults upon us. Guns and Swords, carnal Weapons, are of no Service in this spiritual Warfare. This <HI>Leviathan esteemeth Iron as Straw, and Brass as rotten Wood:</HI> Makes not the least Ac∣count of them. Nor are the Reasonings and Resolutions of our own Minds sufficient to withstand him. No Weapons but <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> are suitable for an Engagement with him; and these will do. <HI>Faith</HI> will give us Courage a∣gainst this infernal Enemy, put Strength into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Souls, and make us stedfast in resisting him. This will <HI>quench his fiery Darts,</HI> and frustrate all his mischievous Designs and At∣tempts

against us. Without Faith we shall never approve ourselves good Soldiers of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> nor <HI>endure Hardness</HI> for him: We shall not be able to <HI>stand in the evil Day,</HI> when it comes to <HI>resisting unto Blood.</HI> Without this we shall never <HI>fight the good Fight of Faith.</HI> When once we loose our Faith, we shall loose our Strength; and like <HI>Sampson,</HI> when his Locks were shorn, shall become weak like other Men, and the Enemy will make an easy Conquest of us, and take us captive at his Will.—But <HI>Faith,</HI> in a lively Exercise, will animate us in our spiritual Conflicts, make us bold and couragious, strong and stedfast; and en∣able us to stand our Ground. This will make us <HI>strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might;</HI> and by this we shall come off <HI>more than Conquerors;</HI> make the Devil flee from us, and fall as Lightning from Heaven before us. <HI>This is the Victory that overcometh the World,</HI> and Satan the God of it, <HI>even our Faith</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. v. 4.</NOTE>.—Oh, Let us all labour to get this <HI>precious Faith,</HI> that we may be able to manage our spiritual Warfare with spiritual Valour, and with Success.</P>
<P>There is <HI>another Warfare,</HI> wherein we are all engaged; and none of us can plead or obtain an Exemption: <HI>A War in which there is no Discharge</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. viii. 8.</NOTE> for any, of any Station, Order, Age or Sex; and in which we must all fall. The last Enemy, <HI>Death;</HI> an unavoidable, irresistible Enemy, will e'er long make his Attacks upon us, and in spight of all Reluctance and Resistance, will carry the Day; <HI>For no Man hath Power over the Spirit, to retain it: Neither hath he Power in the Day of Death</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> Death is the universal Conqueror.—A most formidable Enemy this! the <HI>King of Terrors.</HI> Without <HI>Faith,</HI> there is no Way to combat with him. But Faith fortifies the Christian. He will not stand trembling and aghast at his grim Aspect, and frightful Ap∣proach. No; he goes forth to meet him, challenges him to do his worst, and patiently and joyfully receives the kil∣ling Stroke. Faith puts that Song of Triumph into his
<PB N="36" REF="006128_0034_1027F051538A5D78"/>
Heart and Lips, <HI>Oh Death, where is thy Sting? Oh Grave, where is thy Victory? Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, thro' our Lord Jesus Christ</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 55, 37.</NOTE>. Nay,</P>
<P>Faith alters the Nature and Property of Death, and shews the Believer, that it is a Privilege and Favour to him, and acts the Part of a Friend; delivers him from all the Snares and Sorrows, Temptations and Miseries of this Life, and introduces him into the Joy, the Glory, and the Blessedness of the next. The dying Saint, when in the raised Exer∣cises of Faith, gives Death a welcome Reception; He re∣joices that the Time of his Departure is nigh at Hand, and desires to depart and be with Christ, which, in his gracious Esteem, is by far the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of all.</P>
<P>Thus doth Faith make the Christian more than a Con∣queror over this last Enemy. And nothing but Faith will do it.—An unbelieving Sinner may die without any Bands, any Terrors in his Conscience; yea, and with a Kind of Hope and Joy, but it proceeds from Ignorance and Stupi∣dity. Where a Sinner is really awakened to know his true State, to feel the Guilt of Sin in his Conscience, and to have a Prospect of where is he going, and must take up his ever∣lasting Abode, Horror takes hold of him. Oh, the ama∣zing Dolours and Anguish of his Soul! To him Death is dreadful indeed. He cannot live, and he dares not die. Oh, the <HI>earnest Cries</HI> he now sends up to the God of his Life, for a little longer Time, for a Space for Repentance! Oh, the <HI>solemn Promises</HI> he makes of living better for Time to come, if God will spare his Life.—He dies in the utmost Distress and Agony of Soul, fill'd with a <HI>fearful Looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, to devour him.</HI> But <HI>mark the perfect Man, and behold the Upright, for the End of that Man is Peace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxvii. 37.</NOTE>.</P>

Would you have this <HI>Faith,</HI> which is so absolutely neces∣sary, and eminently serviceable, in managing every Kind of Warfare? <HI>Oh look up to God for it.</HI> Beg it by secret Prayer of the God of all Grace. It is his Work in the Soul, It is his Gift; and he is willing to bestow it on us; for he is rich in Mercy, and gives liberally: But he will be sought unto, to do it for us.—Oh, be sincere and importunate in your Prayers to God for it: Fill your Mouths with Argu∣ments; pray with all Prayer and Supplication, watching thereunto with all Perseverance.—Beg it in Christ's Name, and for his Sake: Christ hath promised us, that if we <HI>ask any Thing in his Name, He will do it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Where God hath of his free Grace and rich Mercy be∣stowed Faith upon you, <HI>Pray for the Establishment and In∣crease of it.</HI> The stronger you are in Faith, the more Glo∣ry will you give to God. This will make your Obedience the more ready and chearful, and your Sufferings the more light and easy. This will make you bold in the Cause of God, will inspire you with a holy Courage against all your Enemies, Men, Devils, and Death: And will give you a certain and blessed Victory over them. This will be your Honour and Comfort, while you live; your Support and Joy, when you die; and will usher you into the glorious World of Light and Love, Peace and Joy, after Death. And when it has enabled you to conquer and triumph over all Enemies, <HI>it shall cease.</HI> You shall have no more Occa∣sion or Use for it. Having lived a Life of Faith <HI>here,</HI> you shall live a Life of Vision <HI>hereafter:</HI> And that God and Sa∣viour, whom you now see by the Eye of Faith, darkly, you shall then see Face to Face, clearly. And having overcome all your Enemies, Christ will take you <HI>to sit with him in his Throne</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 21.</NOTE>; He will bring you near to himself, and crown you with Glory and Honour.—And the more eminent the Victories of your Faith have been, the more distinguish∣ing Glory will be put upon you.</P>
