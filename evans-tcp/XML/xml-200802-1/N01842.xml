<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AFTER the Great and Extra∣ordinary</HI> Acceptance <HI>which the following</HI> SERMON <HI>met with, from so Numerous and Judicious an</HI> Audience <HI>in the Delivery of it from the</HI> Pulpit, <HI>I cannot but think it will be very acceptable to every one from the</HI> Press. <HI>I can by no means therefore comply with the desire of the Reverend</HI> Author <HI>to me, that I would</HI> Excuse <HI>his yielding to
<PB REF="002182_0003_10030C200E563E08"/>
the Printing of it. I think none that heard it will allow me to say a word on</HI> that <HI>head: And after such an uncommon</HI> Attention <HI>as the</HI> Discourse <HI>com∣manded when it was utter'd, there is no room neither left for me to</HI> commend <HI>it to them that heard it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> Author <HI>in a kind and obliging Letter to me ascribes</HI> the unexpected <HI>and</HI> undeserved <HI>Favour of GOD to him,</HI> unto the Prayers of a very religious People, which Heaven hath committed to his Care; <HI>upon whom he had called</HI> to strive together with Him in Prayer to, GOD for him, that his Service might be accepted of the Saints. <HI>And now that it has pleased GOD to give a remarkable</HI> Answer <HI>unto their Prayers, I beseech Him also to give 'em</HI> Humbleness of Mind, <HI>whereby they may accept aright and improve His Grace shown them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IT is a peculiar</HI> Honour <HI>to any Ministers of the Gospel, (and thro' Grace we have not a few among us who share in it) when in</HI> retir'd <HI>Places of Service; out of the way of Fame or any worldly reward, they are dili∣gent in their Studies and</HI> labouring in the Word and Doctrine, to feed the Flock of
<PB REF="002182_0004_10030C232C7C8108"/>
GOD among them; Studying to shew themselves approved unto GOD, Work∣men that need not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth; <HI>that by the help of GOD they may be</HI> wise to win Souls, <HI>be Masters of</HI> acceptable Words, <HI>and meet to</HI> stand <HI>and teach (if called of GOD thereto) before the Greatest of Men. The</HI> Author <HI>is among us a shining</HI> Example <HI>of this Dili∣gence and Proficiency, and GOD is pleased to own and crown his Labours with an un∣common Success: There being within these</HI> Three <HI>last Months added to the Church in</HI> Bradford <HI>no less than</HI> Forty <HI>and</HI> Six <HI>Persons: May they indeed be so many</HI> Seals <HI>of his Ministry, and his Joy in the Day of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and the</HI> LORD <HI>add many more to 'em</HI> daily, such as shall be saved.</P>
<P><HI>MAY their worthy</HI> Pastor <HI>be long continued, a more abundant Blessing to them, and a diffusive one to others: And particularly I pray GOD that this</HI> Martial Lecture Sermon <HI>may be as</HI> profitable <HI>to the Gentlemen of the ARTILLERY COMPANY, and others of us, in the Reading of it, as it was</HI> Plea∣sant <HI>in the hearing: That as the</HI> Preacher <HI>was unto</HI> us as a very lovely Song of one
<PB REF="002182_0005_10030C26137815C8"/>
that has a pleasant Voice, and can play well on an Instrument; <HI>So now that we have</HI> heard his words <HI>we may be of them that</HI> do 'em; <HI>And then we shall indeed</HI> know WHO <HI>has been among us.</HI></P>

<Q><HI>Of Zebulun, such as went forth to Battel, expert in War, with all Instruments of War, fifty thousand, which could keep Rank: they were not of double Heart.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>Relations</HI> in which the All-wise GOD, the Supreme and Absolute Monarch of the Universe, is pleased in His Adora∣ble Sovereignty to place the Children of Men to this state of Probation. And the <HI>Powers,</HI> He sees meet to furnish them with, for the Service of their Generation in
<PB N="2" REF="002182_0007_10030C27EF1B47C8"/>
their respective Posts, are very <HI>many</HI> and <HI>various:</HI> yet all of them are <HI>Essential,</HI> or at¦least <HI>Useful</HI> and <HI>Needful</HI> to the Well-Being of the <HI>Body Politick;</HI> Insomuch, that the <HI>Mechanick</HI> can't say to the Civil <HI>Magistrate,</HI> I have no need of thy Conduct and Protection: nor can the Civil <HI>Magistrate</HI> say to the La∣bouring Tribes of <HI>Zebulon</HI> and <HI>Issachar,</HI> I have no need of your Obedience, and the Fruits of your Painful Industry; seeing even <HI>Crowned Heads</HI> themselves do (under God) depend continually on them for their Estab∣lishment, Preservation, and Supplies.</P>
<P>AND as it is GOD, the <HI>Fountain of Honour,</HI> who in His uncontroulable and mysterious Providence maketh Men to differ; setting up one, and pulling down another; and distributing Gifts to them, as to kind and degree, according to His Holy Will: So He requires and expects, that every Man should <HI>abide in his Calling,</HI> and <HI>seek to excel</HI> in his own Sphaere, in the Improvement of all his Endowments and Enjoyments for the Honour of GOD, his Bountiful Benefactor, and the Interest of his Prince and Country.</P>
<P>INDEED Men may <HI>seek</HI> to Excel, and may <HI>really</HI> do so, in some respects; and yet how much so-ever They may <HI>value</HI> them∣selves on the score of their <HI>Foreign Excel∣lencies,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002182_0008_10030C2E95303D78"/>
They <HI>deserve</HI> little Commendation, because they don't seek to Excel in their <HI>proper</HI> Business: or because they have no <HI>higher</HI> view, than their <HI>own Credit</HI> or <HI>Secular Interest,</HI> in such their seeking to Excel.</P>
<P>THUS, for a <HI>Clergy-man</HI> to be an Ingenious Mechanick, or a considerable States-man, but a <HI>Mean Divine,</HI> a poor Clerk; or to seek to Excel, because he <HI>loves to have the Pre-eminence:</HI> or for an <HI>Advocate</HI> to be able to play skilfully on a Musical Instru∣ment, while he is a <HI>Weak Disputant,</HI> and a <HI>Dull Orator;</HI> or to seek to Excel in the Art of Pleading, merely to draw the more Clients, and fill his own Coffers: In a Word, for a Professor of the Art of <HI>War,</HI> to be a Great Astronomer, but unacquainted with the Mysteries of his <HI>own</HI> Profession; to be <HI>Timorous,</HI> or <HI>False-hearted;</HI> or to seek to Excel in this Art, merely to gra∣tify an <HI>Ambitious</HI> Humour,—How <HI>Dishonour∣able</HI> and <HI>Unbecoming</HI> is This!</P>
<P>WHEREAS for Those, that are set at the Upper End of the World, and hold the Reins of <HI>Government,</HI> to seek, that they may Excel in the Secret Mysteries of <HI>State-Policy,</HI> and in all their Publick Administrations, of <HI>Civil Power,</HI> to the Happiness, and (as far
<PB N="4" REF="002182_0009_100301B3DE249938"/>
as may be) to the Satisfaction of the Com∣mon-Wealth: And for such, as <HI>Wait at God's Altar,</HI> to seek, that they may Excel (according to their Advantages) in <HI>Mini∣sterial Gifts,</HI> and in <HI>Grace,</HI> to the Edifying of the Church, the Salvation of their own Souls, and the Souls of those that hear them: For those that are Employ'd in <HI>Educating of Youth,</HI> to seek, that they may Excel in <HI>Learning,</HI> and in the Art of <HI>Teaching,</HI> to the Softning the Manners, and Greatning the Minds of Youth, and Form∣ing them for Publick Service; still <HI>Train∣ing them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord:</HI> And for all Men of <HI>Business,</HI> and all Sorts of <HI>Relatives</HI> to seek, that they may Excel in their <HI>various</HI> Capacities and Stations for the <HI>Publick Good:</HI> Briefly, for such, as are called to Learn, and as occa∣sion serves, to Practise the <HI>Art Military,</HI> to seek, that they may Excel in all <HI>Mar∣tial</HI> Accomplishments and Atchievments, for the Security and Preservation of the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of the People of GOD; <HI>This is Good and Accep∣table in the sight of GOD our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>AGREEABLY in the Sacred Oracles we find <HI>Good Soldiers,</HI> still mentioned with Ho∣nour: And particularly in our Text, the
<PB N="5" REF="002182_0010_10030C33C058FD40"/>
Soldiers belonging to the Tribe of <HI>Zebulun</HI> are commended, as being Men that Excel'd in <HI>Martial Qualifications.</HI></P>
<P>IN this <HI>Chapter before us</HI> we've an Ac∣count of <HI>Two Musters</HI> of the Militia of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>First,</HI> which was partly at <HI>Ziklag,</HI> and more fully at <HI>Hebron,</HI> was <HI>very</HI> consi∣derable: for we're told, <HI>ver.</HI> 22. that <HI>there came to David to help him, until it was a Great Host, like the Host of God:</HI> i. e. <Q>innumera∣ble, like the Stars or Angels, which are emirently GOD's Hosts.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Second</HI> was a General Muster at <HI>Hebron.</HI> Agreeably we read, <HI>Chap.</HI> II. 1. <HI>All Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron—.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Here let usobserve the Great and Noble Design, the Glorious Occasion, and Joyful Issue of these Musters.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Former</HI> Muster was to make <HI>David,</HI> King over <HI>Judah;</HI> which they effected to very good Purpose, and great Satisfaction, and Advantage: and <HI>David</HI> reigned over that Tribe only Seven Years; during which, <HI>there was a long War between the house of Saul and the house of David:
<PB N="6" REF="002182_0011_10030C387054B228"/>
But David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker,</HI> 2 Sam. 3. 1. <HI>David</HI> rose <HI>gradually;</HI> being first Anointed King in <HI>Reversion;</HI> then in <HI>Possession</HI> of <HI>One</HI> Tribe only, and at last of <HI>All</HI> the Tribes. And thus (says the Pious and Excellent HENRY) "The Kingdom of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Son of <HI>David,</HI> is set up by De∣grees: He is Lord of all by Divine De∣signation, but <HI>we see not yet all things put under Him,</HI> Heb. 2. 8. But, <HI>Lord, How Long!</HI></P>
<P>THE Occasion of the <HI>Latter</HI> Muster was, to <HI>perfect</HI> the Translation of the Kingdom of <HI>Israel</HI> from the House of <HI>Saul,</HI> after, the Death of <HI>Ishbosheth,</HI> to the <HI>Illustrious House</HI> of <HI>David;</HI> or to make <HI>David</HI> King over <HI>All Israel,</HI> ver. 38.</P>
<P>Now the Service, thus done by the <HI>Israe∣litish Regiments</HI> for their Prince and Country: occasioned <HI>Joy in Israel</HI> and <HI>many Thanks∣givings to God:</HI> which, with their Military Skill, Obsequiousness, Courage, Loyalty and Faithfulness, is recorded to their Everlast∣ing Praise, and for the Perpetual Instruction, Imitation, and Encouragement of that Order of Men: And also to teach the People of GOD, what Regards are to be paid to Men of their Character.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002182_0012_10030C3BEE74E608"/>
IN our Text we are informed, 1. Of the <HI>Quota</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Zebulun,</HI> in this Gene∣ral Muster; They were <HI>Fifty Thousand.</HI> 2. We have their <HI>Character,</HI> consisting of Divers Ar∣ticles; which we may particularly Consider and Explain, in speaking to this <HI>Observation</HI> from the Words, as related to the Context: Scil,</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Good Soldiers are an Useful, and Honourable Order of Men, and a Great Blessing to their Prince, and Country.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH Soldiers, as are described in our Text, are <HI>no little</HI> part of the <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> of God's Israel. They're an <HI>Honour</HI> to their Prince and Country, and deserve well of both.</P>
<P>IN Discoursing this Point, I shall, First, consider the <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> of Soldiers, so far as it is laid before us in our <HI>Text.</HI> Secondly, Endeavour to <HI>confirm the Truth</HI> of our Doctrine. Thirdly, Make some <HI>Practi∣cal Reflections:</HI> and Conclude with a Brief <HI>Address</HI> to the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that have call'd me to this Service.</P>
<P>First. WE are to consider the <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> of Soldiers, as Exhibited to us in
<PB N="8" REF="002182_0013_1003019785C73F80"/>
the Text: or What sort of Soldiers these <HI>Zebulinites</HI> were.</P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P>1. <HI>THEY were</HI> (what it is proper all, that profess themselves Soldiers, should be) <HI>Expert in War. Instructi ad Bellum.</HI> They were not <HI>Raw</HI> and Unacquainted with the very <HI>Rudiments</HI> of Soldiery: but were <HI>well Disciplin'd,</HI> and like <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servants, <HI>Trained up</HI> in the Art of War.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Field-Officers,</HI> and all under <HI>Autho∣rity</HI> amongst them, were Men of <HI>Good Con∣duct;</HI> knew the Business of their respective Posts, how to behave themselves, and how to govern in an Army, both in the <HI>Camp</HI> and in the <HI>Field of Battel,</HI> according to the Usage of those Ancient Times. To allude to what is said of the Men of <HI>Issachar, They had Understanding,</HI> in Military Affairs, <HI>to know what Israel ought to do.</HI> They were no Stran∣gers to <HI>Martial Law,</HI> and knew well <HI>When,</HI> and <HI>How</HI> to put it in Execution.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Private Soldiers</HI> were Skilful, and Dextrous in <HI>Handling their Arms,</HI> and Obey∣ing the Directions of their Commanders; so as to Defend themselves, and Destroy their
<PB N="9" REF="002182_0014_10030C40D3E5A0C0"/>
Enemies. It was the Commendation of those, that came to <HI>David</HI> at <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>klag,</HI> Ver. 2. that <HI>they could use both the Right Hand and the Left, in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing Stones, and shooting Arrows cut of a Bow:</HI> And of the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dites,</HI> ver. 8. that <HI>they could handle Shield and Buckler:</HI> And of the Chosen Men of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> Jud. 20. 16, that <HI>they could every one sling Stones at an hair∣breadth, and not miss:</HI> i. e. with great Exact∣ness. Now it's Evident both from <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Scripture,</HI> that all, that are called to be Soldiers, are obliged, as far as possible, to <HI>imitate</HI> these Examples in Military Skill, and Expertness in War.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THEY were</HI> (what it's very desirable all Soldiers should be) <HI>Men that could keep Rank. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> They <HI>deserved order,</HI> which is the Beauty and Strength of an Army. The Officers could do <HI>their</HI> part, and the private Soldiers <HI>their's;</HI> that their <HI>Ranks</HI> might not be broken by the Enemy; or that the Army might <HI>Rally again</HI> immedi∣ately, and <HI>repair</HI> any <HI>Breach</HI> that might hap∣pen, and still make g<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> their Front, and maintain their Ground, and prevent Disorder and Confusion in the Army, which often proves fatal in a Battle. Now this denotes and requires not only Skill, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> They were
<PB N="10" REF="002182_0015_100301BE440EE8F0"/>
Men of <HI>Strong Bodies,</HI> able to endure Hard∣ness, and perform great Exploits; <HI>Effective</HI> Men. They were also Men of <HI>Great Souls,</HI> that would die a Thousand Deaths, rather than play the Coward, and basely fly from their Colours, or desert their Posts: Men, that were not afraid to look their Enemy in the face; nor were they terrifyed <HI>with the Thunder of their Captains, or of their Shouting.</HI> Men, whose Hearts were inflam'd with a true Martial Fire, that <HI>many waters could not quench, nor the floods drown:</HI> Men, not <HI>dis∣may'd,</HI> but <HI>animated</HI> by Difficulty, and resolved on all proper occasions with that brave Gene∣ral, <HI>Joab,</HI> 2 Sam. 10. 12. <HI>To play the men for their People, and the Cities of their God;</HI> leaving the Event to Him, <HI>whose is the Victory.</HI></P>
<P>EVEN thus, <HI>Men, fit for Battel,</HI> are <HI>Men of Might,</HI> ver. 8. who <HI>have faces like the faces of Lions, and are as swift as Roes upon the Mountains,</HI> not to <HI>flic from,</HI> but to <HI>pursue</HI> their Enemy. It's desirable, they should, with <HI>David,</HI> be <HI>girded with Strength,</HI> that even <HI>the bow of Steel may be broken by their arms,</HI> Psal. 18. 34. Then tho' (<HI>the Race is not to the swift, nor the Battel to the strong,</HI> yet) Hu∣manely speaking, it may be hop'd, that <HI>from the blood of the slain, and from the fat of the mighty, their Bow will not turn back, nor their Sword return empty.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="002182_0016_10030C451D77CED8"/>
3. THEY were (what it's highly reaso∣nable and needful all Soldiers should be) Men, that were <HI>not of Double Heart. Absque Corde &amp; Corde.</HI> They were <HI>True Men;</HI> Men of Integrity. <HI>Double-heartedness</HI> is oppos'd to <HI>Faithfulness.</HI> Psal. 12. init. <HI>Help Lord for the Faithful fail—with a double Heart do they speak:</HI> q. d. <Q>They pretend a kind &amp; upright Heart, while their heart is really cruel and deceitful.</Q> They have <HI>divers Setts</HI> of Tho'ts, and speak according to the Company they're with. Such <HI>double-minded Men,</HI> don't make good Soldiers; there's no trust∣ing of them, no depending on such <HI>Unstable Souls.</HI></P>
<P>THE Men of <HI>Zebulun</HI> were not so: they were not govern'd by <HI>private,</HI> sinister Views, like furious <HI>Jehu,</HI> pretending Zeal for the Lord of Hosts, Zeal for <HI>the Church, the Church;</HI> whilst his main design was to aggrandise Him∣self and Family. No, they abhor'd every thing so <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>little,</HI> and had still the great Interests of their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>People</HI> very much at Heart.</P>
<P>[<HI>THEY were not of Double Heart,</HI>] This may intend, that they were <HI>faithful to one another.</HI> The <HI>Officers</HI> were faithful to each other; not striving to break one another
<PB N="12" REF="002182_0017_10030C46A73790E8"/>
from Envy, Revenge or for <HI>filthy Lucre:</HI> And they were faithful to the Soldiers under them, not imposing on them unnecessary Burdens, nor betraying them to their Ene∣mies (as <HI>Joab</HI> did <HI>Uriah,</HI>) not robbing them of, or detaining from 'em their Wages, or invading their Privileges; but carefully instructing them, by Precept and Example, in the Art of War: improving all their skill and interest for their safety and happiness, and to ren∣der them serviceable.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Private Soldiers</HI> (we'll hope) were also faithful to their Commanders, and one to another. They chearfully observ'd the Laws of the Camp: were at their Officer's <HI>Commandment, vers.</HI> 32. And every one <HI>minded His own Business.</HI></P>
<P>THUS it's needful that <HI>All</HI> military Men, whether Officers or private Soldiers, should be faithful to one another. That they should be <HI>of one heart,</HI> in promoting the great Ends of their Calling, (as the <HI>Israelites</HI> were of one heart, to make <HI>David</HI> King, ver. 38.) that they should <HI>stand by</HI> one another, and endea∣vour to <HI>Preserve, Assist</HI> and <HI>Encourage</HI> one another. If Soldiers are not faithful to one another, if <HI>their heart be divided</HI> one from another, they'll soon be found faulty: they
<PB N="13" REF="002182_0018_100301C4F2836D50"/>
may easily mischief, yea destroy one another, and it's well, if they don't do so.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The <HI>Zebulunites</HI> were not of <HI>double Heart,</HI> but <HI>loyal and faithful to their King, and Country.</HI> They all (at least by their Representatives) readily took the Oath of Allegiance at the King's Coronation. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 5. 3. And in taking of it, they sware in Truth, in Judgment, and in Righteousness; without any <HI>mental Reservation;</HI> for <HI>they came with perfect heart to Hebron, to make David King,</HI> ver. 38: And <HI>there David made a League with them.</HI> Considered <HI>collectively, they were not of double heart,</HI> i. e., They were not some <HI>for</HI> David, and others secretly <HI>against</HI> him. And considered <HI>distributively,</HI> they were not of double heart: i. e. <Q>They did none of them pretend to be <HI>David's</HI> Friends, while in their hearts they favour'd the Family of <HI>Saul.</HI></Q> In short, None of them (says the ingenious Mr. HENRY in Loc.) <Q>had any <HI>seperate</HI> Interests, but were all for the <HI>Publick</HI> Good.</Q></P>
<P>EVEN so, <HI>All</HI> Soldiers should be <HI>loyal</HI> to their rightful Sovereign, and <HI>faithful</HI> to their Country. Disloyalty and Rebellion in Sol∣diers, especially in Officers, is an horrid <HI>Crime,</HI> and of wretched <HI>Consequence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="002182_0019_10030C4A11975778"/>
INDEED, we don't exhort to <HI>Passive Obedi∣ence</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> in the utmost Lati∣tude, in which those Doctrines have been preach'd up by some, who (as the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Lawyers</HI> did of old,) <HI>bind heavy Burdens</HI> on Men's shoulders, while they Themselves will not <HI>touch them with one of their fingers.</HI> For (as an Excellent Divine of the Church of England observes) We ought not to press on <HI>others,</HI> what in like circumstances <HI>we our¦selves</HI> are unwilling to perform.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Burket.</HI></NOTE> But we've sufficient <HI>Warrant</HI> to put all our Hearers (and consequently Soldiers) in mind, <HI>To submit to the King, as Supreme; and to Governours, as unto them that are sent,</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. <HI>To exhort every Soul, to be subject to the Higher Powers,</HI> Rom. 13. 1. <HI>Not to speak evil of Digni∣ties.</HI> 2 Pet. 2. 10. Jude. 8. And especially, <HI>not to speak evil of the Ruler of their People,</HI> Act. 23. 5. but to <HI>fear God and honour the King,</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 17.</P>
<P>Now when <HI>Soldiers</HI> are thus <HI>loyal,</HI> as <HI>David</HI> was to <HI>Saul,</HI> while his Subject; and as <HI>Da∣vid's</HI> Soldiers were to <HI>Him;</HI> that can say heartily to their Prince, as <HI>Amasai</HI> of old, ver. 18. <HI>Thine are we David, and on thy side, Thou son of Jesse:</HI> The <HI>very Hearts</HI> of pious Princes and Rulers will be <HI>knit</HI> to such a Mi∣litia,
<PB N="15" REF="002182_0020_10030C4FFA574998"/>
as <HI>David's</HI> was to those, that came to Him at <HI>Ziklag,</HI> ver. 17.</P>
<P><HI>ONCE more,</HI> May'nt we suppose, they were not of double heart, but <HI>faithful toward God? Some</HI> of them doubtless, and we hope <HI>many</HI> among <HI>fifty thousand,</HI> were <HI>Israelites in∣deed,</HI> not only toward their <HI>Prince,</HI> but to∣ward their <HI>God.</HI> However, we are sure that <HI>all</HI> Soldiers <HI>should</HI> be so. All Men should serve God with <HI>Uprightness</HI> and with <HI>Single∣ness of heart.</HI> Their <HI>heart should be right with God,</HI> or they should be truly Religious. Soldiery is not inconsistent with the most eminent Vertue, the most shining Sanctity, the most elevated Piety.</P>
<P>I suppose, the <HI>Sun</HI> never shone on Three braver Warriers, than <HI>Abraham, Joshua</HI> and <HI>David:</HI> And yet who more Renowned for the <HI>Power of Godliness,</HI> than those Worthies? <HI>Cornelius,</HI> a Roman Captain, was <HI>a devout Man, and one that feared God with all his house. And he had a devout Soldier that waited on him continually,</HI> Act. 10. 2. 7.</P>
<P>THO' Men, in some sense, may be said to be <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od Soldiers,</HI> that are none of the <HI>Best Christians;</HI> yet the <HI>Better</HI> Men are, (<HI>Coeteris Paribus,</HI>) the <HI>better Soldiers</HI> they make. And verily such only are truly Religious, who
<PB N="16" REF="002182_0021_10030C5319B01878"/>
are <HI>Sincere,</HI> and in whose Spirits there is no <HI>allowed Guile.</HI> And such Soldiers may expect to have <HI>God on their side,</HI> (when call'd forth to Service) to <HI>cover their Heads,</HI> and <HI>fight their Battels,</HI> to help them to do <HI>valiantly,</HI> and <HI>to tread down their Enemies.</HI> And such <HI>Only</HI> may expect to have the Lord of Hosts <HI>with</HI> them and <HI>for</HI> them: and to have occasion to call upon one another, saying, <HI>Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously!</HI></P>
<P>So then, Soldiers should be <HI>Good</HI> Men, and <HI>True:</HI> Faithful to one another, Loyal to their Prince, and Devout toward God. And truly such, as are not Upright toward God, it's to be fear'd, won't long be Loyal to their Prince. Neither do they deserve, nor can they expect, their Prince should be faithful to them: For such, as we are toward God, we may ex∣pect others will be toward us. <HI>Psal.</HI> 18. 25, 26. <HI>David</HI> was an <HI>upright</HI> Man, a <HI>Man after God's own heart;</HI> and God bless'd Him with <HI>subjects,</HI> that were loyal and not of double Heart. But it's time to say,</P>
<P N="4">4. THESE <HI>Zebulunites were</HI> (and it's necessa∣ry all Soldiers, especially when call'd to Ser∣vice, <HI>should be,) Well Arm'd.</HI> They appeared on this Occasion <HI>with all Instruments of War,</HI> (i. e. that were <HI>then</HI> in use and proper for <HI>that</HI>

Service) to suppress any Insurrection; and to put down and subdue such as might pre∣sume to oppose the King's Coronation; to keep the publick Peace, and grace the So∣lemnity.</P>
<P>SOLDIERS <HI>without Weapons</HI> are but <HI>naked</HI> Men. <HI>Counsel</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> for War won't do well without <HI>Weapons of War.</HI> Indeed Wis∣dom is better without Weapons of War, than Weapons of War without Wisdom. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9. 18. But alas! tho' Men are as <HI>skilful</HI> as <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> as <HI>valiant</HI> as <HI>Joshua,</HI> and as <HI>loyal</HI> and <HI>de∣vout</HI> as <HI>David,</HI> (who was a None-such for Faithfulness, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22. 14.) yet <HI>unarm'd,</HI> they are <HI>unfit</HI> for <HI>Service,</HI> a meer and an easy <HI>Prey</HI> to their <HI>Enemies</HI> in ordinary Cases!</P>
<P>IT was great <HI>Policy</HI> in the <HI>Philistines</HI> of old, to <HI>suffer no Smith to dwell in the Land of Israel,</HI> (while they had Dominion over them) <HI>lest the Hebrews should make them Swords or Spears,</HI> 1 Sam. 13. 19. And it was no less Prudence in <HI>Abraham,</HI> not only to <HI>Train</HI> his three hun∣dred and eighteen Men; but to have <HI>Arms</HI> ready to fit them for an <HI>Expedition</HI> on the least imaginable Warning. And sad was the Case of <HI>Israel,</HI> when in the day of Battel there was neither Sword nor Spear found in the Hand of any of the People.—1 <HI>Sam,</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 20.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002182_0023_100301CCEB902538"/>
SOLDIERS should then he <HI>Armed.</HI> But this is not all: They should have Armour <HI>suita∣ble</HI> for them; Such as they are <HI>used to,</HI> and are <HI>capable of managing:</HI> otherwise their Condition will be like <HI>David's</HI> when going to encounter the great <HI>Goliah,</HI> in <HI>Saul's Armour:</HI> which because He had not <HI>prov'd,</HI> He wi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely begg'd to be excus'd from wearing it. Briefly, They should have Armour, if it may be, adapted to the Circumstances of the Enemy, they're to fight with. Mr. HENRY observes on that Parenthesis in <HI>David's</HI> Elegy <HI>[Also he</HI> <Q><HI>had them teach the children of Judah the use of the Bow.]—That the Children of Judah knew before now how to use the Bow.—But of late they had made more use of Slings, because cheaper. Now David would have them see the Inconvenience of this, (for they were the Archers of the Philistines, that here so hard upon Saul,</HI></Q> 1 Sam. 31. 3. who could do Execution at a greater distance with their Bows, than <HI>Judah</HI> could with their Slings) <Q><HI>and to return to the use of the Bow, and so be able to out do theeir Enemies at their own Weapons.</HI> 'Twas pity (says he) but those, that had such good Heads, and Hearts, and Hands, as the Children of <HI>Judah:</HI></Q> 'Tis pity indeed, but that skilful, couragious, loyal, and devour Soldiers should be well Arm'd.</P>
<P>I'll only add,</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="19" REF="002182_0024_100301CEC1C723A0"/>
5. THESE <HI>Zebulunites</HI> were (and all Sol∣diers should be) Men <HI>ready,</HI> when call'd thereto, <HI>to go forth to Battel:</HI> Or to improve their military Abilities for the Service of the Publick. They came up <HI>willingly</HI> to <HI>Hebron</HI> in Arms, to attend whatever Service there was for them to do <HI>There.</HI> And no doubt they were as ready <HI>afterward</HI> to serve <HI>David</HI> in his Wars, or to go out to Battel against the common Enemies of <HI>Israel.</HI> Thus in the days of <HI>Earak</HI> the <HI>Zebulunites</HI> were among those, that are commended in the <HI>triumphant Song</HI> of <HI>Deborah,</HI> the Israelitish Virago, for <HI>offering themselves willingly, and jeoparding their Lives unto the Death in the high Places of the Field,</HI> Jud. 5. 18.</P>
<P>ON some <HI>extraordinary</HI> Occasions Those, that are <HI>not bred</HI> to War, may be call'd forth to Battel: Thus that Heroine, <HI>Deborah,</HI> took notice, that out of <HI>Zebulun</HI> came those to fight against <HI>Sisera,</HI> that <HI>handle the Pen of the Writer:</HI> Then according to Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore's</HI> Paraphrase,
<Q><L><HI>The Scribes of Zebulun, and Learned Men,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To weild the Sword, laid down the Pen,</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>How much more should those, that are furnish'd with military skill and courage,
<PB N="20" REF="002182_0025_10030C5BE793B6C0"/>
chearfully improve these Talents, when Pro∣vidence gives them occasion; <HI>and fight for their Brethren, their Sons, and their Daughters, their Wives, and their Houses?</HI> Neh. 4.14.</P>
<P>INDEED, Soldiers are not <HI>always</HI> (it may be but <HI>seldom</HI>) call'd to list as <HI>Voluntiers</HI> in mili∣tary Service; because it is reasonable, there should be an <HI>Equality:</HI> But when Soldiers are <HI>call'd</HI> forth by those in <HI>Authority,</HI> they should <HI>willingly</HI> engage in whatever Service, they're call'd to; and not chuse with the <HI>Reubenites</HI> to continue in the <HI>Sheepfolds,</HI> to <HI>bear</HI> the <HI>Bleatings of the Flocks;</HI> rather than venture into the Camp, to be regal'd with the martial sound of the Drum and Trum∣pet: lest they expose themselves to the <HI>bitter Curse,</HI> denounced of old against such, as <HI>came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the Mighty.</HI></P>
<P>BUT thus I've considered the several. Ar∣ticles, in the <HI>Character</HI> of these <HI>Zebulunitish</HI> Soldiers, with what brevity I could: and proceed now to the <HI>Second</HI> general Head of our Discourse, which (that I may'nt be guilty of Tediousness) I shall but touch upon.</P>
<P>LET us then consider,</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002182_0026_10030C5F91E11278"/>
Secondly, THE <HI>Evidence of this Truth;</HI> That the described Soldiers, or such as answer this Character, are an <HI>useful and honourable Order of Men,</HI> and consequently a <HI>Blessing to the Publick.</HI> Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may argue the Truth of our Ob∣servation, from <HI>the honourable mention,</HI> made <HI>expresly</HI> or by way of <HI>allusion,</HI> of this Order of Men and of their office and work <HI>in the Sacred Oracles.</HI> Here we find the <HI>Lord</HI> Him∣self in the <HI>Song of Moses,</HI> (Exod. 15. 3.) stiled <HI>a Man of War.</HI> Here also we find our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> who is <HI>Co-essential</HI> &amp; <HI>Co-equal</HI> with the Father, termed <HI>a Leader and Com∣mander to the People;</HI> (Isai. 55. 4.) And <HI>Cap∣tain of the Lord's Host,</HI> (Josh. 5. 14.) for it was doubtless He, that appear'd to <HI>Joshua</HI> at <HI>Jericho</HI> with a Sword drawn in his Hand.</P>
<P>IN a Word, Many of those, of whom the <HI>Apostle</HI> (in the <HI>Eleventh</HI> to the <HI>Heb.)</HI> tells us, <HI>the World was not worthy,</HI> were <HI>famous War∣riours.</HI> And these <HI>Scripture-Heroe's</HI> are cele∣brated, amongst other things, for <HI>this</HI> parti∣cularly, (to the Immortal Honour of <HI>good Sol∣diers,</HI> who are also <HI>good Men,</HI>) That <HI>thro' faith they subdued Kingdoms; stopped the mouths of Lions; and waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the Aliens.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="002182_0027_10030C61AB2EB7D0"/>
2. WE may further argue the Truth of our Doctrine, from the <HI>Judgment of the Wisest and Best of Men;</HI> and from the <HI>Experience</HI> of the <HI>People of God</HI> in all Ages. If we con∣sider the days of old, and read what is re∣ported concerning <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Father of the Faithful, His arming his trained Sol∣diers, that were born in his house, and con∣sequently had their military Education under him; and the use He made of them: And if we consider, what is storied of <HI>David,</HI> (who is Himself frequently stiled <HI>a Man of War,)</HI> How He took Care and gave Order, at his first coming to the Throne, that his Sub∣jects might be instructed in the Art of War: we may be satisfyed, what was <HI>Their</HI> Judg∣ment in the Case. And if we search the <HI>Histories</HI> of <HI>succeeding</HI> Ages, we shall find a mighty <HI>Cloud of Witnesses</HI> to the present Truth.</P>
<P>BUT to look no further, than <HI>our own Land;</HI> The <HI>Magistracy &amp; Ministry</HI> of the Country have from the Beginning acknowledged the <HI>Valuable∣ness</HI> of this Order of Men. The Civil Magistrate, by granting Commissions to military Officers, and making good Laws for the Observation and Encouragement of frequent Trainings, Annually: And by countenancing and che∣rishing for many Years, and even to this
<PB N="23" REF="002182_0028_100301D34A4FA218"/>
Day, the ARTILLERY COMPANY in this Town: and the Ministers of the Gospel, by the many Sermons, they've Preach'd to <HI>this</HI> COMPANY, amongst other Tokens of their Regards for good Soldiers, have amply sig∣nified <HI>their Judgment</HI> in this Case.</P>
<P>BESIDES (as I said) the <HI>Experience</HI> of all Ages does also evince, that such Soldiers, as these <HI>Zebulunites,</HI> are very useful for the preservation and security of the People of God. They are useful to <HI>prevent mis∣chief. Solomon's</HI> Life-Guard of valiant Men, had every Man his Sword on his Thigh, be∣cause of fear in the Night. <HI>Cant.</HI> 3. 8. Again, They're useful to <HI>revenge Injuries,</HI> done to the Publick: to <HI>recover Captives</HI> and <HI>Spoil,</HI> taken by the Enemy. Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> with his Soldiers <HI>bro't back his Brother Let, and his Goods, and the Women also and the People,</HI> Gen. 14. 16. <HI>David with his men, they reco∣vered all, that the Amalekites had carried away: and rescued his two Wives: there was Nothing lacking to Them—David recovered all.</HI> 1 Sam. 30. 18, 19. They're useful to <HI>suppress</HI> and <HI>destroy</HI> the <HI>Enemies</HI> of God's People. An <HI>Army with Banners</HI> is <HI>terrible</HI> to the Enemy. When <HI>all Nations</HI> compassed <HI>David, like Bees,</HI> He resolves, <HI>that in the name of the Lord▪ He would destroy them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002182_0029_1003020D6409BD10"/>
Finally, WE may argue, that <HI>such</HI> Sol∣diers, as we've heard described, are a pub∣lick Blessing, an useful and honourable Order of Men, from <HI>Their Contrary.</HI> However, this Consideration will <HI>illustrate</HI> the Truth before us, as it is the nature of Contraries to do. Not only undisciplin'd and cowardly, but disloyal, treacherous and mutinous Soldiers <HI>are a Reproach, and Plague to their Prince and Country.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Contraria juxta se posita, cla∣ruis elucescunt.</HI></NOTE> Such Soldiers are but <HI>Armed Enemies;</HI> a most <HI>dangerous</HI> Sort of Men, both to Church and State. They that are not <HI>for</HI> Us, are <HI>against</HI> Us; and the more expert in War, the more bold and daring, the more active and strong, so much the worse.</P>
<P>Too many <HI>recent</HI> Instances, in the <HI>British</HI> Empire, do sadly verify this Assertion. O that <HI>this</HI> might never have been <HI>to be told in Gath, and publish'd in the streets of Askelon!</HI></P>
<P>BUT to mention no other Argument; I pass to make two or three <HI>Reflections</HI> on the preceeding Discourse. And,</P>
<P>First, FROM what we've heard, we may infer, Whether we <HI>are,</HI> and what we must <HI>be</HI> and <HI>do,</HI> if we would approve our selves,
<PB N="25" REF="002182_0030_10030C637A0AE6E8"/>
<HI>good Soldiers of Jesus Christ.</HI> Why; we must answer the <HI>Character</HI> of these <HI>Zebulu∣nites;</HI> be such Soldiers under <HI>Christ,</HI> as they were under <HI>David.</HI> If we are real Christians, we are listed under Christ's Banner; we're all, of whatever Age, Sex, or Quality, en∣gag'd in a <HI>Holy War.</HI> Our Enemies are very many, politick, powerful, deceitful, malici∣ous, and indefatigable. Our eternal Happi∣ness depends on our being <HI>good Soldiers,</HI> under this our <HI>Glorious Captain,</HI> or <HI>Genera∣lissimo</HI> of the Saints, in this our militant State.</P>
<P>Now if we <HI>are,</HI> and would <HI>approve</HI> our selves <HI>such,</HI> we must be <HI>his willing People,</HI> (Psal. 110. 3.) and serve Him <HI>not of constraint, but willingly: not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.</HI></P>
<P>'DIVINES say indeed, that in <HI>Baptism</HI> Christ gives Men <HI>Press-Money</HI> to serve Him: but He would not have them do it <HI>against their wills. He draws his People with the Cords of a Man, and the Bands of Love,</HI> Hos. 11. 4. He directs his Embassadours to <HI>compel</HI> Men to serve Him, by <HI>force of Argu∣ment, </HI> not by <HI>force of Arms.</HI> All <HI>Real</HI> Christi∣ans <HI>offer themselves willingly,</HI> to serve in His War against their <HI>Ghostly Adversaries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002182_0031_100301DB476EEC70"/>
AGAIN, We must be <HI>cloathed with the whole Armour of God:</HI> of the several Parts of which the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks in the 6th of <HI>Ephes.</HI>—We must <HI>put</HI> on, and <HI>keep</HI> on our whole Armour, Night and Day, during Life.</P>
<P>AGAIN, We must not be of <HI>double Heart.</HI> We must be <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>charitable</HI> one to another. As we are <HI>One Body,</HI> we should study to be of <HI>One Mind;</HI> to be sure, of <HI>One Heart.</HI> If the Hearts of Christ's Sol∣diers are <HI>divided,</HI> it is very lamentable. It pleases the <HI>Adversary;</HI> He has his wish: <HI>Divide &amp; Impera,</HI> is an <HI>Old Maxim</HI> with Him.</P>
<P>THIS also grieves the <HI>faithful Servants of Christ: For the Divisions of Reuben there were great Searchings of Heart.</HI> It weakens the <HI>whole</HI> Army; <HI>And the more considerable the Persons, the more fatal.</HI> It wounds <HI>Religion;</HI> provokes <HI>God</HI> to <HI>withdraw</HI> from his People: But I forbear—. Christ's Soldiers should <HI>live peaceably</HI> one with another; and beware of making a mutiny in the Army: They must stand <HI>for,</HI> and stand <HI>by</HI> one another: <HI>forgive one another,</HI> and not fight with their Fellow-Soldiers: <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. <HI>ult.</HI> 24. <HI>c. ult.</HI> They should <HI>bear one another's Burdens:</HI> Gal. 6, 2.

Christ s Disciples,</HI> His Soldiers, even by our <HI>loving one another,</HI> Joh. 13. 35.</P>
<P>AGAIN, We must be <HI>loyal and dutiful to Jesus Christ.</HI> We must be at his Command∣ment, and follow Him, where-ever He calls us. We must heartily <HI>espouse,</HI> and as far as possible <HI>maintain his Cause,</HI> and not impru∣dently betray it, or basely disown and desert it. We must therefore be <HI>strong</HI> and <HI>very couragious:</HI> not timorous and faint-hearted. <Q>The <HI>fearful</HI> lead the Van amongst those, that shall be sent to the Bottomless Pit,</Q> <HI>Rev.</HI> 21. 8. We have to do with a <HI>restless Adversary,</HI> who (as was said of <HI>Marcellus,</HI> a Roman Commander,) is never quiet, <HI>Nec Victor, nec Victus,</HI> neither Conquering nor Conquered. We must therefore be in good Earnest, and <HI>resist him stedfastly in the Faith:</HI> and <HI>not fight, as those that beat the Air.</HI> It's not eno' to '<HI>make a flourish with our Weap<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns,</HI> as that Phrase signifies. Slight Skirmishes won't <HI>serve the Turn;</HI> we must come to down-right blows; and either kill or be kill'd. And therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> WE had need be <HI>very skilful</HI> in spiritual Soldiery; <HI>Expert in this War.</HI> We must not be <HI>ignorant of the Devices,</HI> and Stra∣tagems of <HI>Satan.</HI> We must <HI>know our selves▪</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="002182_0033_10030C6D8CCBD160"/>
and realize the <HI>Vanity,</HI> the <HI>extreme</HI> Vanity of the <HI>World:</HI> And we must study to be more <HI>exact</HI> and <HI>accurate</HI> in managing our <HI>spiritual Weapons,</HI> in our spiritual Warfare.</P>
<P>WE must <HI>expect</HI> to meet with <HI>hard Things</HI> (as some of Us have done already! and) as Those have done, who are arriv'd, where <HI>the Wicked cease from troubling, and where the Weary are at rest:</HI> But let us not <HI>faint,</HI> nor be <HI>dismay'd; He who hath delivered us, doth deliver; and in him we trust, that He will yet deliver us,</HI> 2 Cor. 1. 10.</P>
<P>IF we are real Christians, we have a glorious <HI>Commander,</HI> and a good <HI>Cause:</HI> We've good <HI>Armour,</HI> and good <HI>Company:</HI> and if we overcome, (<HI>And we shall Overcome!</HI>) we shall then have a glorious <HI>Reward.</HI></P>
<P>LET us then <HI>encourage our selves in the Lord our God, who hath given Leviathan to be Meat to his People inhabiting the wilderness.</HI> Our Enemies are <HI>already</HI> vanquish'd. <HI>Christ,</HI> our Captain, has overcome. We may there∣fore triumph <HI>before</HI> the Battel; and with loudest Shouts of Joy cry out, <HI>Thanks be to God, who giveth us the Victory; nay, who maketh us more than Conquerors thro' Jesus Christ our Lord!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="002182_0034_10030C70F52AA050"/>
Secondly, HENCE 'tis evident, that it's <HI>desirable,</HI> that <HI>such Soldiers,</HI> as have been described, and the <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Exercises</HI> proper to train them up <HI>should by all means be encourag'd and countenanc'd.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE such Soldiers are a <HI>Publick Blessing,</HI> the People of God should be <HI>thankful</HI> for them; show them due <HI>Respect;</HI> Give them deserved <HI>Praise;</HI> and not grudge them a plentiful <HI>Reward</HI> of their difficult and hazar∣dous Services.</P>
<P>HENCE also it follows, not only that it is <HI>praise-worthy</HI> in Christian Legislators to <HI>make Laws</HI> to <HI>oblige</HI> all proper Persons to <HI>attend</HI> Trainings and military Exercises; and This even in Time of <HI>Peace,</HI> that they may learn the Art of <HI>War;</HI> seeing <HI>Preparation</HI> for War, may be a means to <HI>prevent</HI> it, or, how∣ever, many pernicious Consequents of it: But also, that it's highly <HI>reasonable,</HI> that all in Authority, whether Migistratical or Military, should take Care, that those Laws are <HI>duly executed,</HI> and not trifl'd with and evaded; by Officers <HI>shifting off</HI> Trainings to the Edge of <HI>Winter,</HI> when the Days are <HI>short,</HI> and often <HI>cold,</HI> and little can be done; and then indulging the private Soldiers to come <HI>unseasonably,</HI> and to <HI>mispend</HI> their
<PB N="30" REF="002182_0035_10030C78525D6E68"/>
Time, and abuse Themselves in <HI>Drinking</HI> some inebriating Liquor; and not to break up till late at Night; turning Trainings into vile, intemperate <HI>Frolicks.</HI></P>
<P>I only enquire, whether <HI>such</HI> Trainings are not a scandalous <HI>Trifling</HI> with a <HI>Wise, Just and Good</HI> Law, and to be greatly <HI>Discounte∣nanc'd?</HI> And wish to Heaven, that the <HI>Field-Officers</HI> in each <HI>New-English</HI> Regiment, or Those that ought to inspect that Affair, be they who they will, would always <HI>exert themselves,</HI> to <HI>prevent</HI> Disorders of this Kind; and add upon the whole, <HI>The good Lord pardon our Training-Day-Sins!</HI></P>
<P>WHEREAS, Training-Days appointed and attended <HI>in season,</HI> and duly improv'd for the <HI>right Ends</HI> of Training, (Scil. to make Men expert in War, and prepare them for military Service) are agreeable to the Will of God, and pleasing to Jesus Christ, and of great advantage to the Common-Wealth, tending to furnish it with a well-disciplin'd Militia.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> LET all my Hearers of the Mili∣tary Order <HI>suffer a Word of Exhortation:</HI> Labour, I beseech you, to answer the <HI>Cha∣racter</HI> of these <HI>Zebulunites;</HI> that has been set before you, as the Time would allow.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002182_0036_100301E1B5BF00B0"/>
STUDY to be <HI>expert in War:</HI> To be <HI>able to keep Rank:</HI> And <HI>be not of double Heart.</HI> Let such especially, as are <HI>Officers</HI> or <HI>Com∣manders,</HI> or that may probably be so, seek that they may <HI>excel</HI> in military Accom∣plishments.</P>
<P>To this End, Let all, whether Officers or Private Soldiers, be <HI>diligent in the use of Means.</HI> Conscientiously <HI>attend</HI> Trainings. <HI>Use makes perfect,</HI> in handling Arms, and in all military Postures and Motions, as well as in other Things. <HI>Give your selves to Reading.</HI> Read frequently <HI>Histories</HI> of famous <HI>Warriers.</HI> The Scripture, and other Histories afford abundance of such Exam∣ples. Read also the excellent <HI>Sermons</HI> (of which there is an abundant Supply in the Country, both ancient and modern) wherein Soldiers are <HI>counsel'd, encouraged,</HI> and <HI>taught</HI> what they should <HI>be</HI> and <HI>do.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, <HI>Be much in Prayer to God.</HI> Military Skill, and Courage, and Faith∣fulness are the good <HI>Gifts of God.</HI> The great God <HI>instructs the Husbandman to Discretion;</HI> He vouchsafes also to <HI>teach</HI> his Servants, whom he calls to such Ser∣vice, <HI>the Art of War:</HI> And <HI>there is None
<PB N="32" REF="002182_0037_10030C7D579166C8"/>
teacheth like Him.</HI> Now these good Gifts are to be obtain'd <HI>in a way of Prayer, Ask, and it shall be he given you: for every one, that asketh, receiveth.</HI></P>
<P>ALL those <HI>famous Hero's</HI> of your Order, that you have read, or heard of, or seen. They have received all their Skill, and Cou∣rage from GOD. <HI>David</HI> could say, <HI>Thou girdest me with strength.</HI> Psal. 18. 39. <HI>He tencheth my hands to war.</HI> 2 Sam. 22. 35.—Go then to <HI>God</HI> in the <HI>Name of Christ,</HI> who <HI>gives to all Men liberally, and upbraids no man;</HI> and what he sees good, he will give unto you.</P>
<P>BRIEFLY, <HI>Give God the glory</HI> of all your military Attainments, and Exploits; and <HI>improve</HI> them <HI>for</HI> his Glory. Thus did <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 144. 1, <HI>Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth my hands to war: and my fingers to fight.</HI> His is the Glory: And He is worthy to receive it; <HI>And expects that what we win by Prayer, we should wear with Praise.</HI> This is the way to have our Gifts encreased, and continued with Com∣fort. <HI>Let not then the strong Man glory in his Strength;</HI> nor the valiant Man glory in his Courage: nor the skilful in his Con∣duct: <HI>But let him, that glorieth, glory only
<PB N="33" REF="002182_0038_10030C7F7832F680"/>
in the Lord,</HI> who is the Glory of all His People, and particularly of the Mi∣litary Order.</P>
<P>LO <HI>these Things, we have searched them, so they are; hear them, and know them for your Good,</HI> Job. 5, 27.</P>
<P>I shall now <HI>conclude</HI> with a brief <HI>Ad∣dress</HI> to the Ancient and Honourable <HI>Company</HI> who have called me to preach the Word at this time.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>I easily believe, there is no need of <HI>disswading</HI> Men of <HI>your</HI> Character from the horrid <HI>Vices,</HI> by which too many of the military Order in our Days have made Themselves Infamous. And I please my self, that <HI>you</HI> need no Arguments to prevail with you to <HI>continue loyal</HI> to the wisest and best of Kings upon Earth, our rightful and gracious Sovereign, King GEORGE: or to <HI>submit</HI> to <HI>His Excellency,</HI> the GOVERNOUR, whom GOD hath set over us: and to <HI>love your Country,</HI> and to
<PB N="34" REF="002182_0039_100301E8B59E1EB8"/>
be ready, if call'd thereto, to sacrifice your Lives for it's Preservation and Pros∣perity.</P>
<P>INDEED, Our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the <HI>Blessed and the only Potentate,</HI> who has the absolute <HI>Power</HI> of Peace and War, has for the present <HI>caused Wars to cease to the Ends of the Earth.</HI> And we shall have great cause to praise the Name of the Lord, if there may still be <HI>Truth, and Peace in our days:</HI> and to say, Let <HI>King</HI> GEORGE live for ever, by whose wise and powerful Influence, under GOD, <HI>we enjoy great Quietness.</HI></P>
<P>BUT alas, What <HI>Changes</HI> are <HI>in the Right Hand of the most High,</HI> is beyond <HI>Humane</HI> View. This we know, that it is a <HI>sinful, contentious</HI> World, we live in: That the Time is <HI>not</HI> come, when the <HI>Nations shall learn War no more:</HI> That (as a grave Divine, now with God, would sometimes say,) <Q><HI>We can't expect any long settled Peace; but must look for frequent Tumbling and Over∣turning, till the Man of Sin become a Son of Perdition; and His Kingdom come</HI> (The Lord hasten it!) <HI>wherein there shall be no Adversary, nor evil Occurrent.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="002182_0040_10030C840CCC0040"/>
AND verily if we consider, how <HI>Iniqui∣ty abounds,</HI> even the <HI>Iniquities</HI> foretold by the Apostle (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. <HI>init.</HI>) to be the Sins of the <HI>last Times:</HI> and see how the <HI>Love of Many</HI> to Jesus Christ, His Church, the Ministers of the Gospel, and to one ano∣ther, <HI>waxeth cold;</HI> We may justly expect <HI>perillous Times,</HI> yea that a <HI>Day of Trouble is near.—Deus avertat Omen!</HI></P>
<P>I do therefore beseech you, (Brethren, and all the Sons of Mars amongst us,) that you will <HI>attend</HI> your Military Exercises from <HI>time to time,</HI> not only as an ingenious, laudable, and manly <HI>Recreation;</HI> but as a <HI>Preparation for War.</HI> Were your Martial Exercises indeed only for Diversion; yet considering the <HI>Nature</HI> of them; and how often the <HI>Christian Life</HI> is in <HI>Scripture</HI> com∣pared to a <HI>Warfare;</HI> what <HI>Occasion</HI> they minister for <HI>noble</HI> and very <HI>useful</HI> Re∣flections; and especially when I consider, how often the inspired <HI>Doctor of the Gentiles</HI> in his incomparable Epistles, does <HI>allude</HI> to the Grecian <HI>Games:</HI> I must be <HI>excus'd,</HI> if I can see no <HI>Reason</HI> to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n∣demn,</HI> but rather to <HI>applaud</HI> Your Custom of having a <HI>Sermon</HI> annually preach'd to you; wherein you may be minded, how you ought to govern your selves in res∣pect of your Exercises, and what <HI>spiritual</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="002182_0041_10030C87702B6BC0"/>
Use you, and others may make of them. How much more obvious is the <HI>Propriety</HI> of these your Anniversary religious So∣lemnities, if we consider their <HI>Original,</HI> and I suppose still professed <HI>Design</HI> of upholding them?</P>
<P>I beseech you then, to <HI>remember what you have received and heard,</HI> from Year to Year, from many <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>eminent</HI> Ministers of the Gospel, who thro' the Goodness of GOD do several of them remain unto this present, but I suppose <HI>the greater part are fallen asleep.</HI></P>
<P>AND I will only add, (for alas, what shall He say, that comes after so many Masters of Reason and Divine Oratory!) Remember, that how strong, and coura∣gious, and skilful, and well-arm'd, how rich, and honourable, and learned, how vertuous, and useful, and well-beloved soever you are, still <HI>at your best Estate you are</HI> every one of you <HI>altoge∣ther vanity.</HI> You are mortal, and <HI>must die like other Men.</HI> You are <HI>accountable</HI> to the <HI>Judge of all the Earth,</HI> who is <HI>no Respecter of Persons,</HI> for all that is done by you on this Stage of Action. And if you are not <HI>good Christians,</HI> Israelites indeed, as well as <HI>good Soldiers,</HI> you will be <HI>mise∣rable thro' eternal Ages.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="002182_0042_100301EA62C98480"/>
SEE to it then, that you are not of <HI>Double Heart;</HI> but be <HI>faithful unto Death,</HI> and <HI>whatever you do,</HI> and particularly in your Military Exercises, <HI>Do all to the glory of GOD, and in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Verily I say unto you <HI>Blessed</HI> are those Soldiers, yea Blessed for ever, are all they, whom the Lord, when He cometh, (<HI>and He will come quickly,</HI>) shall find <HI>so doing.</HI></P>
<P>AND now <HI>the Lord of Hosts, who is the God of Peace,</HI> and <HI>Captain of our Salvation,</HI> be with you, and all His People. AMEN!</P>
<CLOSER>Tibi, Domine!</CLOSER>
