<P>FORASMUCH, as there have been many Disputes arisen of late concerning the <HI>Medium of Exchange</HI> in this Colony, which have been occasioned chiefly by Reason of our having such large Quantities of Paper <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on some of the Neighbouring Governments, passing in Payments among us, and some of those Governments having issued much larger Sums of such Bills than were necessary to supply themselves with a com∣petent <HI>Medium of Exchange,</HI> and not having supplied their Treasuries with any Fund for the maintaining the Credit of such Bills; they have therefore been continually depreciating and growing less in their Value, and have been the principal Means of the Depreciation of the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> emitted by this Colony, by their passing promiscuously with them; and so have been the Occasion of Much Embarrasment and Injustice, in the Trade and Commerce of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olony, and many People and especially Widows and Orphans have been great Sufferers thereby. But our Legislature having at length taken effectual Care to prevent a further Depreciation of the <HI>Bills</HI> of this Colony, and the other Govern∣ments not having taken the like prudent Care, their <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> are still sinking in their Value, and have in Fact sunk much below the Value of the <HI>Bills</HI> of this Colony. Yet some People among us, by long Custom, are so far pre∣judiced in Favour of a sinking Medium, and others not being really sensible of the true State of the Case, are inclined to think that <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments ought to be a legal Tender in Payments in this Colony for all Debts due by Book and otherwise where there is no special contract expressly mentioning some other Currency, and others being of a different Opinion, the Disputes have been
<PB N="4" REF="006933_0004_102a9b50df3dd550"/>
carried on so far, as to occasion some Expence in the Law, and may be likely to occasion much more, unless prevented by those Prejudices being some way removed. And since it is a Cause wherein every one is more or less interested, I have ventured to shew my Opinion, with a sincere Desire to have Peace and Justice maintained and promoted in the Colony. Not desiring any Person to approve of my Obser∣vations any farther than he finds them agreeable to the Principles of Justice and right Reason.</P>
<P>THE CASE STATED.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a Man comes to a Trader's Shop in this Colony to buy Goods, and the Trader sells him a certain Quan∣tity of Goods and tells him the Price is so many Pounds, Shillings and Pence, <HI>(let it be more or less)</HI> to be paid at the Expiration of one Year, from that Time, and the Man receives the Goods but their is nothing said either by Sel∣ler or Buyer, what Currency it is to be paid in, but the Goods are charged according to the Value of <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> Old Tenor on this Colony.</P>
<P>Now I Query what the Creditor has a Right to demand for a Debt so contracted; or what the Debtor can oblige him to accept in Payment?</P>
<P>The Creditor says, that the Debt being contracted in the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> he ought to have what is known by the Laws of said Colony to be Money: And that he has no Right to demand any thing else.</P>
<P>The Debtor says, That <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbour∣ing Governments have for many Years passed promiscuously with <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on this Colony as Money in all Pay∣ments, <HI>(except special Contracts)</HI> and that People in general where the Contracts ly at large have expected, and do still expect, that any of the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on any of the Governments in <HI>New-England,</HI> that have obtained a Currency in this Colony will answer in Payment, and in as much as the Creditor did not give him any Notice to the con∣trary, when he bought the Goods, therefore he thinks that such <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> ought to be accepted in Payment
<PB N="5" REF="006933_0005_102a9b5272068c90"/>
for the aforesaid Debt. And altho' there is no particular Statute in this Colony, that such <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> shall be a legal Tender in Payments of Money: Yet the Practice has been so universal for so long a Time, and the Creditor himself has both received and pass'd them as Money con∣stantly without making Exceptions against them 'till this Debt was contracted, and for many Years all Demands on Book Debts have been for Old-Tenor Money indiffe∣rently, without Distinction of Colonies, and Judgments in all Courts have been given thereon accordingly: And any of the aforesaid <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> have pass'd in Payment to satisfy all Judgments, so obtain'd and this universal Custom, the Debtor saith, ought to be esteem'd as common Law and ought not without some special Reason to be set aside, and that in this Case there is nothing special; and therefore the Creditor ought not to make Demand or obtain Judgment different from the common Custom of the Colony.</P>
<P>In Answer to this the Creditor saith, that altho' <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments have for a Number of Years been pass'd and receiv'd in Payments: Yet it has been only by the voluntary Consent of the Persons receiving them, and not because they were under any Obligation to receive them; and that it is no Argu∣ment that a Person shall be obliged to receive any species when it won't answer his End, because in Time past he has receiv'd it when it would answer. And the Creditor further saith, that such <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> are of no intrinsick Value, and their Extrinsical Value is fluctuating and very uncertain, and therefore it would be unjust that any Person should be obliged to receive them in Payment as Money in this Colony, (since neither the Colony nor any of the Inhabitants thereof are under any Obligation either to Refund said Bills or to maintain the Credit of them) for Money ought to be something of certain Value, it being that whereby other Things are to be valued. And I think it is a Principle that must be granted that no Govern∣ment
<PB N="6" REF="006933_0006_102a9b54b9d5f438"/>
has a Right to impose on its Subjects any foreign Currency to be received in Payments as Money which is not of intrinsick Value; unless such Government will assume and undertake to secure and make Good to the Possessor of such Currency the full Value which they oblige him to receive it for. Because in so doing they would oblige Men to part with their Estates for that which is worth nothing in it self and which they don't know will ever procure him any Thing. And <HI>Rhode-Island Bills of Credit</HI> have been so far from being of certain Value and securing to the Possessor the Value that they were first stated at, that they have depreciated almost four seventh Parts in nine Years last past, as appears by their own Acts of Assembly. For in the Year 1743, it appears by the Face of the Bills then emitted that <HI>Twenty-seven</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor was equal to one Ounce of Silver. And by an Act of their General Assembly pass'd in <HI>March</HI> last, they stated <HI>Fifty-four</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor Bills equal to one Ounce of Silver, which sunk their Value one half. And by another Act in <HI>June</HI> last, (viz. 1751) they stated <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Shillings in their Old-Tenor Bills equal to one Ounce of Silver. And by another Act in <HI>August</HI> last they gave Order and Direction to the Courts in that Colony to make Allowance to the Creditors in making up Judg∣ment from Time to Time as the Bills shall depreciate for the Future, which shows that they expect their <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> to depreciate for the Future. And since the Value of the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> depend wholly on the Rate at which they are stated and on the Credit of the Government by whom they are emitted and that being the only Reason and foundation upon which they obtained their first Currency and by which the same has been upheld ever since their first being current, and therefore when the Publick Faith and Credit of such Government is violated, then the Reason upon which such Bills obtained their Currency ceases and there remains no Reason why they should be any longer current.</P>
<P>And this I would lay down as a Principle that can't be denied that a Debtor ought not to pay any Debts with
<PB N="7" REF="006933_0007_102a9b57cb06d0a0"/>
less Value than was contracted for, without the Consent or against the Will of the Creditor,</P>
<P>And the Creditor further saith, that his accepting <HI>Rhode-Island Bills of Credit</HI> when they stood stated equal to Silver at <HI>Twenty-seven</HI> Shillings an Ounce, can be no Reason that he should receive them at the same Value when they are stated equal to Silver at <HI>Fifty-four</HI> Shillings an Ounce, and still to receive them at the same Rate when they are so reduced down that <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Shillings is equal to but one Ounce of Silver, and whoever does receive them so must not only act without, but against Reason.</P>
<P>And the Debtor can't possibly plead without any Truth that he expected to pay in <HI>Rhode-Island Bills of Credit</HI> at their present Value and under their present Circumstances, (any Debts contracted before the aforesaid Act of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> were published) because there was no such Thing (as those Bills are under their present Circumstances) existing at the Time of Contract, for as was observ'd before, the Value of such <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> depend wholly upon the Rate at which they are stated and on the Credit of the Govern∣ment by whom they are emitted, and a <HI>Bill of Credit</HI> for the same Sum that is stated equal to Silver at <HI>Twenty-seven</HI> Shillings an Ounce, must be of more than double the Value of one stated equal to Silver at <HI>Sixty four</HI> Shil∣lings an Ounce if the Credit of the Emitter may be de∣pended on: But if the Emitter's Credit can't be depended on then neither of the Bills aforesaid are of any Value, because it is evident that no <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> have any Value in themselves, but are given to secure something of intrinsick Value, to the Possessor.</P>
<P>So that the Arguments drawn from Custom are of no Force, because the Reasons upon which that Custom were grounded do now cease.</P>
<P>I grant that if any Thing whose Value is intrin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> invariable the same should obtain a Currency as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>of Exchange</HI> for a great Number of Years in any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it might with some Reason be urg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that it ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="006933_0008_102a9b5adfb50cd8"/>
accepted in Payments for Debts where there is no special Agreement for any other Species. But if what is us'd as a <HI>Medium of Exchange</HI> is fluctuating in its Value it is no better than unjust Weights and Measures, both which are condemn'd by the Laws of GOD and Man, and therefore the longest and most universal Custom could never make the Use of such a <HI>Medium</HI> either lawful or reasonable.</P>
<P>Now suppose that Gold or Silver Coines that pass cur∣rent in Payments at a certain Rate by Tale should have a considerable Part of their Weight filed or clipp'd off will any reasonable Man judge that they ought to pass for the same Value as those of full Weight. But the State of <HI>R—I—d Bills of Credit</HI> is much worse than that of Coins that are clipp'd, because what is left of those Coins is of intrinsick Value: But the General Assembly of <HI>R—I—d</HI> having depreciated their <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> have thereby violated their Promise from Time to Time, and there is just Reason to suspect their Credit for the Future for the small Value which they now promise for said Bills, and they have not only violated their Pro∣mise as to the Value pretended to be secured to the Possessor by said Bills; but also as to the Time of calling them in and paying the same, they having lengthened out the Time Fifteen Years. So that if the Possessor must be kept out of the Use of his Money until that Term is expired (and the Bills secure nothing to him sooner.) One Ounce of Silver paid down now, would be worth more than <HI>Seven</HI> Pounds <HI>Ten</HI> Shillings in such <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> computing the Interest at 6 <HI>per Cent per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>These Things considered can, any reasonable Man think that such <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> (or rather of no <HI>Credit</HI>) ought to be a legal Tender in Payment of Money in this Colony for Debts, for which the Debtor received Species of much more Value than those Bills provided the Creditor could get the full Value of them in Silver that they are now stated at. For it must be remembred that
<PB N="9" REF="006933_0009_102a9b5d133b9580"/>
according to the State of the Case now in Question the Goods were charged according to the Value of Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony. Wherefore upon the whole it ap∣pears that it would be evidently unjust to impose <HI>Rhode-Island Bills of Credit</HI> in payment for such a Debt, or any other in this Colony, unless the Creditor obliged himself by a special Agreement to receive them in Pay∣ment.</P>
<P>And if he had agreed to receive them in Payment for Debts contracted any Time between last <HI>March</HI> and <HI>June</HI> it would be unjust to oblige him to take them without three Shillings on the Pound Allowance, for the General Assembly of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> depreciated them so much in <HI>June</HI> below both their current and stated Value in <HI>March</HI> preceding. And to oblige People to receive them with∣out such Allowance in this Colony; would be, to be more dishonest than they are in <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Colony for they are obliged by Law to make Allowance for the De∣preciation. But in as much as we are not under the Jurisdiction of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Government and therefore can take no Benefit by their equitable Acts, I suppose that according to the Rules of the Law, upon a Contract made in this Colony for the Payment of <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the Colo∣ny of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> or any of the neighbouring Governments. If the Debtor could not procure such Bills under the same Circumstances that they were at the Time of Con∣tract, the Courts would assess Damages for <HI>Connecticut</HI> Money, according to the Value of such Bills at the Time of Contract. And the Reason is, because if on the one Hand all such Bills should be called in and burnt between the Time of Contract and the Time of Payment it would be unreasonable to oblige the Debtor to an impossibility, and on the other Hand if there should between the Time of Contract and the Time of Payment be an Act pass'd that all such Bills should be brought into the Treasurer to be redeemd' by a certain Time or else be Outlawed and rendered of no Value and that Time should be expired
<PB N="10" REF="006933_0010_102a9b60815d1f00"/>
before the Time of Payment, or if by an Act of Assem∣bly they should be depreciated and sunk one half or two third in their Value, it would be unreasonable that the Creditor should be thereby defrauded of his just Due and lose so much of his Estate.</P>
<P>But to impose <HI>Rhode-Island Bills of Credit</HI> in Payments for Debts in this Colony when the Creditor never agreed to take them, and that without any Allowance for the Deprecia∣tion, would be to take away Men's Estates and wrong them of their just and righteous Dues without either Law or Reason.</P>
<P>And instead of having our Properties defended and se∣cured to us by the Protection of the Government under which we live; we should be always exposed to have them taken from us by Fraud at the Pleasure of other Governments, who have no Right of Jurisdiction over us. And according to this Argument, if <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> General Assembly had been pleased last <HI>June</HI> to have stated their Old-Tenor Bills equal to Silver at <HI>Forty-eight</HI> Pounds <HI>Twelve</HI> Shillings an Ounce, instead of <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Shillings, and so have cut off the Value of them <HI>Eighteen</HI> Shillings on the Pound, instead of <HI>Three</HI> Shillings, all Creditors in this Colony would thereby have been necessitated to lose <HI>Ninety</HI> Pounds out of every <HI>Hundred</HI> Pounds of their Debts which were then out standing, for if they could take away one Sixth Part of their Value and reduce them so much below the Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony and the Creditor be notwithstanding obliged to receive them with∣out any Allowance, by the same Rule they might have taken away three Quarters or Nine Tenths or in∣deed the whole, and the Creditor have had no more Remedy than he has now. And the Estates of poor Widows and Orphans must according to this Principle in the same unjust Manner be taken away from them and given to others that have no Right to them, (for what the Creditor loses in this way the Debtor gains because the more the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> depreciate the less Value the Debtor can procure them for) and according to the Debtor's
<PB N="11" REF="006933_0011_102a9b62e840c388"/>
Argument the Executive Courts in this Colony must give Judgment in Favour of all this Fraud and Iniquity at least, 'till there is some special Act of Assembly to order them to the contrary; but I believe that every honest Man of common Sense, upon mature Consideration of the Circumstances of the Case, will think that this is an Iniquity not to be countenanced, but rather to be punished by the Judges.</P>
<P>But in Answer to what is said concerning Demands being made for Old-Tenor Money indifferently and the Courts giving Judgment accordingly. The Creditor saith that Phrase in all Demands made in this Colony ought to be understood to be the Old-Tenor Money of this Colony, and no other, for there never was any Law in this Colony that <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments should be a legal Tender in Payments of Money, and I have observed before that it would be un∣reasonable, that any such Foreign Currency should be im∣posed as Money, and the same Phrase is us'd in taxing Bills of Cost in the Executive Courts, but it is understood to be the Old-Tenor Money of this Colony only, for a <HI>Thousand</HI> Pounds in <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments would not be sufficient in the Law to satisfy a Bill of Cost of <HI>Twenty</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor.</P>
<P>☞ And the General Assembly of this Colony have suf∣ficiently declared that they don't Esteem such <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> as Money, and that no Person ought to be obliged to receive them as such. In that, they themselves will not receive them for their Wages neither do they oblige any other Person whose Fees or Wages are stated by Law to receive them, but have made Provision how they shall be paid exclusive of such Bills. And as to the Objection that they have been receiv'd in Payment to satisfy all Judgments given as afore∣said, the Creditor saith, that it was only by the voluntary Consent of the Receiver, but there is not the same Reasons that they should be received now at the same Value as <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on this Colony that there was formerly because it is evident that there is now a real Difference in
<PB N="12" REF="006933_0012_102a9b65c1b076f0"/>
their Values. For by a Law of the Province of the <HI>Massa∣chusets-Bay,</HI> their Bills of Old-Tenor are stated equal to Silver at <HI>Fifty</HI> Shillings an Ounce and <HI>Seven</HI> Shillings and <HI>Six</HI> Pence are equal to <HI>One</HI> Shilling Proclamation Money, and the Executive Courts in this Colony reckon <HI>Eight</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony equal to <HI>One</HI> Shil∣ling Proclamation Money which is equal to Silver at <HI>Fifty-four</HI> Shillings Old-Tenor an Ounce. And by an Act of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> General Assembly <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Shillings of their Old-Tenor Bills is stated equal to one Ounce of Silver, at which Rate <HI>Nine</HI> Shillings and <HI>Six</HI> Pence is equal to but <HI>One</HI> Shillings Proclamation Money, whereas three Years ago the Bills of Old-Tenor on all the three Governments aforesaid were of equal Value.</P>
<P>And since it appears, that there is such a Difference in the stated Value of the aforesaid <HI>Bills of Credit,</HI> no Man can with any Propriety be said to make them all without Distinction, a Standard to value Things by; for a Man could afford to sell any Goods or Merchandize for a less Sum in Old-Tenor Bills of the <HI>Massachusets-Bay,</HI> than for the Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony and he could afford to sell Goods for a less Sum by 15 <HI>per Cent</HI> for the Old-Tenor Bills of this Colony, than for the Old-Tenor Bills on <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Colony.</P>
<P>And to say that an Accompt is charged in Old-Tenor Money indifferently of this and the neighbouring Govern∣ments, is to say that 7<HI>s.</HI>-6<HI>d.</HI> and 8<HI>s.</HI> and 9<HI>s.</HI>-6<HI>d.</HI> are one and the same Sum, or that there is no Difference between <HI>Fifty</HI> and <HI>Fifty-four,</HI> or between <HI>Fifty-four</HI> and <HI>Sixty-four</HI> Q. E. D.</P>
<P>And since it appears that it would be evidently absurd to make a Demand for Old-Tenor Money indifferently of this and the neighbouring Governments, it follows that all Demands made for Old-Tenor Money in this Colony must be for the Money of this Colony exclusive of the Old-Tenor of the neighbouring Governments, or else for the
<PB N="13" REF="006933_0013_102a9b6773fb4bf8"/>
Old-Tenor Money of some one of the other Governments exclusive of the Old-Tenor of this and the rest.</P>
<P>And since nothing but a special Contract can intitle any Person to demand the Money of any other Govern∣ment, for a Debt contracted and demanded in this Colony: It necesssarily follows, that all Demands for Debts due by Book, where the Contract lyes at large must be for the Money of this Colony only.</P>
<P>What I would be understood to mean by Old-Tenor Money of the Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> is, whatsoever is established by Law in said Colony to pass, as or in Lieu of Money, rated according to its Value in Old-Tenor Bills on said Colony, and I suppose that the Words (Old-Tenor) when us'd in Contracts are universally <HI>understood</HI> to be intended only to assertain the Value of the Sum to which they are affixed and they must be so understood when the Executive Courts tax Bills of Cost in Old-Tenor Money, for they have no Right neither do they mean to exclude Bills of the New-Tenor, or any of those Coins established by Law (to pass in Payment for Fees) from being a sufficient Tender in Payment of such Costs.</P>
<P>And now I have gone through with what I first proposed. But perhaps some, may be ready to say, <HI>that we are sensible that it is of bad Consequence to have a fluctuating Me∣dium of Exchange, but what can be done to Remedy it?</HI></P>
<P>I answer take away the Cause, and the Effect will neces∣sarily cease.</P>
<P>But it may be further objected, that if it were not for the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on the neighbouring Governments, we should have no Money to Trade with, and what should we do for a <HI>Medium of Exchange?</HI> or how could we live without?</P>
<P>To this I answer, that if that were indeed the Case, we had better die in a good Cause than live in a bad one. But I apprehend that the Case in Fact is quite the reverse, for we in this Colony are seated on a very fruitful Soil,
<PB N="14" REF="006933_0014_102a9b6ac754d8a8"/>
the Product whereof, with our Labour and Industry, and the Divine Blessing thereon, would sufficiently furnish us with, and procure us all the Necessaries of Life and as good a <HI>Medium of Exchange</HI> as any People in the World have or can desire. But so long as we part with our most valuable Commodities for such <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> as are no Profit; but rather a Cheat, Vexation and Snare to us, and become a <HI>Medium</HI> whereby we are continu∣ally cheating and wronging one another in our Dealings and Commerce. And so long as we import so much more foreign Goods than are necessary, and keep so many Merchants and Traders employed to procure and deal them out to us: Great Part of which, we might as well make among ourselves; and another great Part of which, we had much better be without, especially the Spiritous Liquors of which vast Quantities are consumed in this Colony every Year, unnecessarily to the great Destruction of the Estates, Morals, Health and even the Lives of many of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>I say so long as these Things are so we shall spend great Part of our Labour and Substance for that, which will not profit us. Whereas if these Things were re∣formed, the Provisions and other Commodities which we might have to export yearly, and which other Govern∣ments are dependant upon us for, would procure us Gold and Silver abundently sufficient for a <HI>Medium</HI> of Trade. And we might be as independent, flourishing and happy a Colony as any in the <HI>British</HI> Dominions.</P>
<P>And with Submission I would humbly beg Leave to propose it to the wise Consideration of the Honourable General Assembly of this Colony; whether it would not be conducive to the welfare of the Colony to pass some Act to prevent the Bills last emitted by <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Colony from obtaining a Currency among us. And to appoint some reasonable Time (not exceeding the Term that our <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> are allowed to pass) after the Expiration of which none of the <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> on <HI>New-Hampshire</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="006933_0015_102a9b6d2845bcf8" MS="y"/>
or <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> shall be allowed to pass in this Colony, that so People having previous Notice thereof may order their Affairs so as to get rid of each Bills to the best Advantage that they can before the Expiration of such Term.</P>
<P>And whether it would not be very much for the Pub∣lick Good to lay a large Excise upon all Rum imported in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this Colony or distilled herein, thereby effectually to restrain the excessive use thereof, which is such a growing Evil among us and is leading to almost all other Vices. And I doubt not but that if those two great Evils that have been mentioned were restrained we should soon see better Times.</P>
