<HEAD>Conformity to Truth, in Knowledge and Practice, essential to Happiness. A <HI>Farewell</HI> SERMON.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I NOW</HI> rise to speak on a very solemn and import∣ant subject; in the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ion of which I shall not adopt the method or language of any one (except in a few lines of poetry) but shall make those observations and reflections which my own views and feelings, on this affecting occasion, have suggested to my mind.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> variety of things that I shall have occasion to mention, will render it necessary for me to be very brief on each particular.</P>
<P><HI>I WOULD</HI> now ask your serious, patient, and candid attention, while I attempt, through divine assistance, to speak from those words of our Saviour to his disciples, recorded in
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOHN, xiii.17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>"<HI>If ye</HI> know <HI>these things, happy are ye if ye</HI> do <HI>them.</HI>"</P></Q></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the course of divine providence, I am, this day, called, my dear friends, to bid you <HI>farewell</HI>— You are, this day, to hear my parting address. To bid you farewell (if it is any thing more than mere compliment; if there is any significancy in the phrase) implies a sincere wish that you may be truly happy; happy in time, and happy through eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="021351_0003_0FB31A71EB4214D8"/>But you never can be happy; you cannot fare∣well in the present world, much less can you farewell in the world to come without the knowledge and practice or those things, which he, upon whom all your temporal and eternal welfare entirely depends, has commanded you to know and observe. If you are diligent in obtaining the knowledge, and faithful in pursuing the practice of those important truths, which the God of nature and the God of grace has revealed in his works and in his word, then I can not only bid you farewell (i. e. sincerely <HI>wish</HI> your wel∣fare) but also assure you that you <HI>actually</HI> will forev∣er farewell. That you will farewell while travelling through this vale of tears. That you will farewell when passing through the valley of the shadow of death. That you will farewell in your intermedi∣ate state: That you will farewell in the morning of the resurrection. That you will farewell in the so∣lemn process of the last great decisive day: That you will farewell through the revolution of numberless millions of ages: That you will farewell amidst all the new, surprizing, and infinitely various scenes that even a whole eternity can produce.</P>
<P><HI>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</HI> These words were spoken by the benevolent Jesus, just before his crucifixion, to his disciples. See the context, <HI>ver.</HI> 1—12.</P>
<P>IN the prosecution of the present subject we shall, through divine assistance, attempt to exhibit a brief view of the <HI>doctrines</HI> you must know, and the <HI>duties</HI> you must do, in order that you may be happy; that you may farewell.</P>
<P>We shall not pretend in this discourse, to give a complete methodical system of all the doctrines and duties of religion: but shall only mention some im∣portant, essential things, which if you know, happy are you if you do them. It is proposed,</P>
<P N="1">I. To exhibit a brief view of the doctrines which you must know.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021351_0004_0FB31A73DD29FCF8" MS="y"/>That peculiar kind of existence which we call KNOWLEDGE, and which is no where to be found but only in the mind of a thinking, intelligent being, always has truth for its object.</P>
<P>So happily are things constituted by the great au∣thor of nature; the supreme source of all intelligence —That it is impossible that any thing which is not <HI>really true,</HI> should be <HI>certainly known</HI> to be true: admitting this principle, then it necessarily follows, That whatever is <HI>certainly known</HI> to be true, is <HI>really true.</HI> Hence it is evident, That if five, ten, twenty, an hundred or a thousand persons (be the number greater or less) know any thing to be true, then they will, in this respect, not only all agree with <HI>each other,</HI> but they will also all agree, or harmonize with the <HI>object</HI> of <HI>knowledge.</HI> This being the case, there is a foundation for complete happiness in the intellectu∣al world. Let all the individuals of the whole in∣telligent system, according to their respective capaci∣ties, <HI>know</HI> the truth, and all <HI>embrace</HI> the truth they know, then there will not only be a harmony between the <HI>understanding</HI> and the <HI>heart</HI> in each individual, considered by himself, and a harmony among all the individuals considered with relation to each other, but also each individual <HI>separately,</HI> and all the in∣dividuals <HI>collectively,</HI> will harmonize with one <HI>common object</HI>; all their views and affections will have one <HI>common center.</HI> They will consequently all be happy, —they will all farewell.</P>
<P>If any number of persons certainly know any thing to be true, then these persons do, in this respect, per∣fectly agree together in their ideas; and not only so, but also the ideas of each individual, perfectly agree with the object of knowledge. There is, therefore, in this case, a perfect harmony of sentiment: a har∣mony founded in immutable truth, and the eternal nature of things. Hence it is evident, that all dis∣putes and difference of sentiment originate in the <HI>ig∣norance</HI> of one or both of the contending parties. For as has been already intimated, knowledge universally
<PB N="6" REF="021351_0005_0FB31A7566D32DB0"/>
implies an agreement in sentiment, difference in senti∣ment, therefore, universally proceeds from ignorance.</P>
<P>Should any one be so bold as to assert,—"That there is no such thing as truth:" or (supposing that there is truth) "that there is no such thing as know∣ledge:" I should think myself authorized to be e∣qually bold to tell such a person, in reply, that there was no <HI>truth</HI> in his assertion: or, at least, that he was <HI>ignorant</HI> of what he said. For any one to say "That it is <HI>true</HI> there is no such thing as <HI>truth</HI>:" or, "That he <HI>knows</HI> there is no such thing as <HI>knowledge,</HI>" is to say that which is self-contradictory, and there∣fore utterly unworthy of any regard. No one can de∣ny the existence of truth, without appearing in the character of a complete <HI>liar.</HI> For he that adopts the principle, "That there is no such thing as truth:" can claim no right to the character of a man of truth, sincerity, or honesty. He can claim no right to be regarded as being <HI>true</HI> in any of his <HI>words</HI> or <HI>actions.</HI> Neither can any one deny the existence of knowledge, without appearing in the character of a perfect <HI>fool.</HI> For he that adopts the principle "that there is no such thing as knowledge," never can, consistently, pretend to be a man of any knowledge or good sense. All, therefore, who would not ap∣pear in the character of perfect <HI>knaves</HI> or <HI>fools</HI> must necessarily admit that there is in nature <HI>immutable truth</HI> and <HI>infallible knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Truth is the foundation of knowledge, and know∣ledge the foundation of practice. In the knowledge and practice of truth; or in other words expressive of the same idea, in a complete harmony of sentiments and actions, all having relation to one common ob∣ject, consists the perfection of the whole intelligent system, and of all the individuals of which the whole system is composed. In the knowledge and practice of those things, which the great author of your nat∣ure has injoined, and in this way only, you may obtain happiness: happiness which has a foundation
<PB N="7" REF="021351_0006_0FB31A776E416288"/>
as extensive as universal truth, and lasting as your immortal souls.</P>
<P>We shall now, as was proposed, immediately pro∣ceed to exhibit a brief view of some important essen∣tial doctrines, which, in order that you may be happy, you must know.</P>
<P>Without entering on a long detail of particulars, we shall only just mention some things relative to the being and perfections of God; the nature of the di∣vine law, the beauty of holiness; the deformity of sin; the necessity of regeneration; the death of the body; the immortality of the soul; the general re∣surrection; the final judgment; the eternal states of rewards and punishments.</P>
<P>We shall not attempt, at present, to give a formal proof, nor enter on a curious and critical demonstra∣tion, but shall only briefly remind you of these things, taking it for granted that you know them already: Or to use the language of the Apostle Peter, <HI>To put you in remembrance of these things though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>THAT THERE IS A GOD, "all nature cries aloud through all her works." <HI>The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being un∣derstood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Rom. i.20.</NOTE> <HI>He has not left himself with∣out witness, in that he does good and gives rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Acts xiv, 17.</NOTE> <HI>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth know∣ledge.</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Psa. x<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x, 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>The existence of the deity is so evident that it nev∣er can with any pretence of reason be denied. It nev∣er has, and never will be said by any but <HI>fools,</HI> "that there is no God." There can be no <HI>effect</HI> without a <HI>cause.</HI> Nor can there be any <HI>particular,</HI> secondary cause, without a <HI>universal</HI> first cause. If, therefore,
<PB N="8" REF="021351_0007_0FB31A7858A5FF60"/>
there is no God, that is, no <HI>creator,</HI> then there are no <HI>creatures,</HI> and, consequently, no beings to affirm or deny the existence of a God. Therefore, if there are any beings to affirm or deny the existence of a God, then a God exists. To say "there is no God," is the same as to say "there is no truth," and to say, "there is no truth" <HI>is a lie.</HI></P>
<P>God is that awful and glorious Being, who immut∣ably and eternally possesses, in the highest degree, all possible perfection. His proper name is JEHOVAH: which signifies an eternal self-existent being: or, as it is expressed in the Revelation of St. John, a being <HI>who was is, and is to come.</HI> God is a spirit, infinite, eternal, immutable, self-existent, self-sufficient, omni∣potent, omniscient: possessing unsearchable wisdom, boundless goodness, immaculate holiness, impartial justice, and infallible truth. There are three persons in the divine nature. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three persons are ONE GOD. All the sacred Three are engaged in the redemption of fallen man. We are to conceive of this glorious redemption as being <HI>contrived</HI> by the Father, <HI>executed</HI> by the Son, and <HI>applied</HI> by the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>THE DIVINE LAW is, like its author, absolutely perfect; being holy, just and good; requiring com∣plete uninterrupted, perpetual obedience of every intelligent moral agent in the universe. It is sum∣med up in the following words: <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself.</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Luke x, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P>Rational beings, by being made capable of <HI>moral action,</HI> become the proper subjects of the <HI>moral law,</HI> and are rendered accountable to the <HI>moral governor</HI> of the world. Every moral action is either <HI>conform∣able</HI> or <HI>not conformable</HI> to the moral law. Hence there are <HI>two species</HI> of moral action. Every moral action, which is conformable to the moral law, is cal∣led
<PB N="9" REF="021351_0008_0FB31A79CD8DD170"/>
HOLINESS. Holiness is, in its own nature, most excellent, beautiful, and amiable, and displays, to every unprejudiced mind, the most captivating charms. It is the very image of the Deity.</P>
<P>The other species of moral action, viz. that which is not conformable to the moral law, is called SIN. Sin is of a most deformed and hateful nature— it is a horrid monster, pregnant with wo—it is the fruitful source of all the confusion and misery that ever has, or ever will take place in Jehovah's dominions. But though sin has a most destructive t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ency, is, in its own nature, calculated to disturb the whole system of intelligent beings, throw the universe into the ut∣most disorder, and shake the foundations of nature even to the throne of God; yet being under the ab∣solute controul of the supreme Governor, all the terrible effects of its operation are entirely confined to the SINNER, i. e. the <HI>Author</HI> of sin: so that it never can, in the final result of things, be, in the least degree, injurious to any holy beings. Sin is <HI>essentially</HI> different (not in degree, but) in its <HI>nature</HI> from holiness. All who are the <HI>servants,</HI> must re∣ceive the <HI>wages</HI> of sin, which is DEATH—DEATH temporal and eternal.</P>
<P>Man is a moral agent. His first moral actions, in his primeval state, were perfectly conformable to the unerring rule that was given him by his Maker. But he soon transgress'd the bounds that God pre∣scrib'd, and thereby subjected himself to the curse of his holy law. <HI>For it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii.10.</NOTE> <HI>Lo, this only have I found, that GOD made man upright; but</HI> they <HI>have sought many inventions.</HI><NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Eccl. vii.29.</NOTE> <HI>We are all, by nature, the children of</HI> disobedience, <HI>and, consequently, the children of</HI> wrath.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii.2 3.</NOTE> <HI>We must, therefore, be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</HI><NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv.23.</NOTE> WE MUST BE BORN AGAIN <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Joh. iii, 27.</NOTE> <HI>For without holiness we never can see the

And this must be the object of our <HI>immediate</HI> attention. Delays, in this case, are infinitely dangerous. Our longest oppor∣tunity is but short, and this short opportunity of very uncertain continuance. The soul, unless it is united to Christ before it is separated from the body, will inevitably be ruined forever: but the present union of soul and body, is one of the most precarious things in nature. We are continually exposed to DEATH. <HI>It is appointed unto men once to dis.</HI><NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix, 27.</NOTE> Every indivi∣dual of mankind is now under the same awful sen∣tence that was originally denounced upon the first of the human race: <HI>Dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return.</HI><NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii, 19.</NOTE> Therefore, <HI>there is no man that hath power over the spirit, to retain the spirit; neither hath the power in the day of death, and there is no discharge in that war.</HI><NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Eccle∣siastes viii.8.</NOTE> But though <HI>the silver cord</HI> will soon be loosed, <HI>the golden bowl be broken,</HI> the vital union be dissolved, and the body mingle with its native dust; yet the soul surviving this dissolution, will exist for∣ever.</P>
<P>The SOUL is, in its own nature, or at least by di∣vine constitution IMMORTAL. While it is in this world, united to the body, it has (if I may be allow∣ed the phrase) a kind of equilibrium or <HI>balance</HI>; float∣ing, as it were, on the surface of a wide extended ocean: but as soon as death dissolves the union, it will begin and eternally continue to <HI>rise</HI> and <HI>fall</HI> in

pleasure or pain; still advancing on from stage to stage, in endless progression. We are so formed by the great author of our natures, <HI>the father of our spi∣rits,</HI> that we have, within ourselves, irresistable evi∣dence of the <HI>immortality</HI> of the soul:</P>

You must be truly sorry for your sins, and ask God, for Christ's sake, to forgive you. Christ died for <HI>sinners</HI>—he died for <HI>children</HI>—he died for <HI>you.</HI> You must love God, and pray to him; be obedient to your parents, and kind to one another; then God will take care of you while you live in this world; receive you to himself when you die; and make you happy for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>children,</HI> the endearing relation now subsisting between you, must quickly be dissolved. Death will, e'er long, <HI>separate</HI> you from each other; but you must shortly <HI>meet</HI> again—meet at the solemn bar of your final Judge. Happy, inexpressibly happy will be your condition, if you should meet at the right hand of the blessed Saviour. In order that you may have such a joyful meeting, it is absolutely ne∣cessary that you now sincerely repent of your sins, and by a living faith, be <HI>united</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>HUSBANDS and WIVES, of every age, a sincere regard for your temporal and eternal welfare now excites the warm desire, that you may, by divine assistance, be enabled to fulfil the various duties of the conjugal state—that you may live in peace and mutual love—ever strive to promote each other's good—be united to Christ—walk together as heirs of the grace of God—and then, though death should part you for a while, yet you will shortly meet again, in a happier world, to part no more.</P>
<P>WIDOWS and FATHERLESS CHILDREN, I leave you with my friendly wishes that you may be enabled and disposed to trust in the Lord—be the objects of his kind and constant care—have your wants supplied from his bounty—your hearts com∣forted with his love—and always rejoice in the light of his countenance.</P>
<P>To <HI>you,</HI> my dear <HI>Brethren</HI> and <HI>Sisters</HI> of THIS CHURCH, for the kind regard you have ever shown to me, I now return my most grateful acknowledge∣ments.

<P>Let me remind you, that it is of infinite impor∣tance that you be really sincere in your profession— that your lips and <HI>hearts</HI> agree: For the heart search∣ing God will receive none to his favour, but only those who are actually and personally interested in the merits of his Son.</P>
<P>Often have I endeavoured to warn you of the dan∣ger, and point out the fatal consequences of resting in the outward form of godliness, without feeling its inward power. Let me intreat you to remember, as far as you are able, what has been said upon this, and all other important and interesting subjects, which I have, in times past, attempted to suggest to your minds—for now my pastoral relation to you, my dear brethren, is dissolved.</P>
<P>After various concurring circumstances had ren∣dered a separation unavoidable, I frequently antici∣pated the affecting scene—but never felt, I must confess, before it actually took place, the full weight of the solemn transaction—a transaction, which, tho' it really is, at least in my view, attended with many melancholy circumstances, yet is what I have con∣ceived, and do still conceive, all things considered, to have been necessary.</P>
<P>I now leave you, my dear brethren, in a situation, which is, in some respects, very disagreeable. It affords me, however, an animating prospect to consi∣der, that I leave you under the indulgent care of an infinitely powerful, wise, and kind PROVIDENCE. May the God of all grace and consolation comfort and support you under every trial; relieve you in
<PB N="18" REF="021351_0017_0FB31A8FDB6ED3C0"/>
every difficulty; direct and assist you in every duty. May he supply you with a Pastor more worthy than myself, and better qualified for the important cha∣racter—One in whom you may all be happily united. and under whose ministry you may be greatly in∣structed, and edified; and long enjoy, in love and peace, the precious ordinances of the blessed gospel.</P>
<P>I am now, my dear brethren, separated from you; but we shall certainly meet again on a future day— and where shall we meet—?</P>
<P>Though by some, perhaps, I may be thought to transgress the bounds of modesty, yet I will venture to make the declaration, That I humbly hope in divine mercy, through the merits of the Saviour, to find a happy seat on the right hand of my final Judge—and God grant that you may be my joy and crown of rejoicing in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming.<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. ii.19.</NOTE> May the supreme Dispenser of every blessing, by his efficacious influence and heavenly grace, prepare both you and me to meet together in that glorious world, where all tears will be wiped from every eye, and where holiness and happiness will reign in full perfection for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Permit me now, my dear friends, to make an ad∣dress to you ALL who have been the people of MY CHARGE.</P>
<P>Some of you, during the course of my ministry here, have been peculiarly kind; and I hope I may ever retain on my mind, the grateful impression that has been made by your friendly regard. The real welfare of you <HI>all</HI> is the object of my sincere desire. If there are any of you whom I have injured, I now ask your forgiveness—and those, who have either <HI>done</HI> or <HI>meant</HI> an injury to me, I heartily forgive.</P>
<P>From the time of my settlement in the town, you have known my manner of life.</P>
<P>I have ever been as far from the <HI>inclination,</HI> as the
<PB N="19" REF="021351_0018_0FB31A910FE85B70"/>
<HI>ability,</HI> of making that splendid appearance, and shin∣ing figure in the world, which captivates the atten∣tion, and gains the applause of the generality of man∣kind—I have not aspired after superfluous wealth or grandeur. You are my witnesses, that I have never wished, at least, that I have never desired of you, any thing more than a comfortable subsistence; or such means of support as might enable me to apear and conduct with a decency and dignity becoming the <HI>character</HI> I sustained—and this, you must be sensible, was not an unreasonable demand.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>complaint</HI> that some have made, of my being "too much <HI>reserved</HI> in conversation," <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would just observe, that I have, even myself, some∣times, considered this as an unhappiness—an unhap∣piness resulting, at least in a great measure, from my natural constitution, and peculiar circumstance in life. I do not mean, however, to wholly justify myself in this respect. We are <HI>all</HI> liable to err—some on the right hand, and some on the left—some use their tongues too <HI>little,</HI> and some too <HI>much.—In many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</HI><NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Jam. iii.2.</NOTE></P>
<P>My circumstances have been, in various respects, peculiarly difficult. Being naturally of a slender con∣stitution—living remote from my brethren in the ministry—But I have not time, at present, nor, if I had, would it be proper now to improve it in enu∣merating the particulars relative to my singular situ∣ation, since I have sustained the relation of a Pastor to this people.</P>
<P>As to my <HI>sentiments</HI>; though I have not the con∣fidence to say that I have, in every instance, been absolutely free from <HI>error</HI> (for I pretend not to infal∣libility) yet this I can say, that through the whole course of my preaching, I always endeavoured to de∣liver such doctrines, as I did then, and do now,
<PB N="20" REF="021351_0019_0FB31A95D48A1E20"/>
solemnly believe to be <HI>true:</HI> doctrines, which, being clearly viewed by the understanding, sincerely em∣braced in the heart, and consequently practised in the life, imply the eternal salvation of the soul.</P>
<P>I consider myself as being accountable to God for the doctrines which I have embraced myself, and which I have delivered to you. And if I have deliv∣ered to you the truth, then you are accountable, not only for what you actually <HI>have,</HI> but also, for what you <HI>might have</HI> heard.</P>
<P>In the former part of this discourse, I mentioned some important things, which it is necessary for you to KNOW, and which, if you do know, happy are you if you DO them. Happy are you if the <HI>exercises</HI> of your <HI>hearts</HI> correspond to the dictates of a well regulated understanding. Would you be truly hap∣py in <HI>this</HI> world or the <HI>next</HI>—would you FARE WELL in <HI>time</HI> and through <HI>eternity</HI>—then</P>
<P>Be sincere friends to the God that made you— Learn to contemplate, with increasing wonder and delight, his glorious perfections— Fear, love, reve∣rence, adore and praise him —Make application to the Father, in the name of the Son, for the influen∣ces of the Holy Spirit—Constantly attend to <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>family</HI> prayer—Attentively observe, and carefully improve, the various dispensations of divine Provi∣dence —Study the divine law, and make it the only rule of all your conduct—With diligence and impar∣tiality, search the sacred scriptures—Follow after holiness—Strive against sin—Be renewed in the spirit of your mind—exercise repentance toward God, and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ—Ever feel your infinite obligations to God; your constant and entire dependence upon him; and the necessity of your having the special influences of his Holy Spirit— Be not anxious in providing for your <HI>bodies,</HI> which must shortly return to the dust; but attend to the one thing needful— Take care of the infinitely im∣portant concerns of your <HI>souls,</HI> which must exist for
<PB N="21" REF="021351_0020_0FB31A9715C8FB08"/>
ever. Persevere in a course of holy obedience to the divine will—always depending entirely on the grace and mercy of God, through the merits of his Son, for the acceptance of your persons and performances.</P>
<P>In <HI>this way,</HI> and in this way <HI>only,</HI> you may be eternally happy. On condition that you do, <HI>in reality,</HI> pursue the course that is <HI>here</HI> recommended, and on <HI>this</HI> condition <HI>only,</HI> I with the greatest confidence assure you, that you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll die in peace—be raised again in glory—be seated on the right hand of the blessed Saviour—escape hell's everlasting horrors, and possess the complete and endless joys of heaven.</P>
<P>Let me intreat you all, my dear friends, to attend to the things that belong to your eternal peace, even NOW, without any delay. It is infinitely dangerous to <HI>procrastinate</HI> or put off to a future time.</P>
<Q><L>In human hearts, what bolder thought can rise,</L>
<L>Than man's presumption on to-morrow's dawn!</L>
<L>Where is to-morrow?—In another world.</L>
<L>For numbers this is certain; the reverse</L>
<L>Is sure to none —</L>
<L>Be wise to-day; 'tis madness to defer;</L>
<L>Next day the fatal precedent will plead;</L>
<L>Thus on, 'till wisdom is push'd out of life:</L>
<L>Procrastination is the thief of time;</L>
<L>Year after year it steals, till all are fled,</L>
<L>And to the mercies of a moment leaves</L>
<L>The vast concerns of an eternal scene.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Young.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>You have had many opportunities, which are now irrecoverably gone; and even those which you now enjoy, are continually passing away. Life is fast spending, and Death is swiftly approaching.</P>
<Q><L>See, with what speed the fleeting minutes fly,</L>
<L>And teach this lesson,—Mortals, learn to die.</L>
<L>Each beating pulse leads on to certain death,</L>
<L>And life is shorten'd by each heaving breath.</L></Q>
<P>All your opportunities for securing a state of eter¦nal happiness in the future world, will for ever cease, as soon as your present life is ended. But <HI>what is your life? It is a VAPOUR that appeareth for a little while, and then vanisheth away.</HI><NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">James iv, 14.</NOTE></P>
<Q><PB N="22" REF="021351_0021_0FB31A9A0C154EB8"/>
<L>Your life is ever on the wing,</L>
<L>And death is ever nigh:</L>
<L>The moment when your lives begin,</L>
<L>You all begin to die<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Watts.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>Yet on so precarious a thing, the life of the <HI>body,</HI> depends the <HI>eternal</HI> state of the <HI>soul.</HI></P>

<L>Hang everlasting things!</L>
<L>Th' eternal states of all the dead,</L>
<L>Upon life's feeble strings.<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Watts.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P><HI>Now,</HI> while the union between the soul and body continues, you must, by faith, be united to Christ— It must be NOW or NEVER. The least delay in this matter, is not only perfectly <HI>unreasonable</HI> in itself, but also infinitely <HI>dangerous</HI> in its <HI>consequences.</HI></P>
<Q><L>The NOW that flies, may be the last;</L>
<L>Seize the salvation ere 'tis past,</L>
<L>Nor mourn the blessing gone:</L>
<L>A THOUGHT'S delay is ruin here;</L>
<L>A closing eye, a gasping breath,</L>
<L>Shuts up the golden scene in death,</L>
<L>And drowns you in despair!<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Watts.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>I have a few words of special advice to give you, and then shall take my leave of you all.</P>
<P>Attend strictly to the duties of the SABBATH, and constantly maintain the public worship of God; <HI>Not forsaking the assembling yourselves together, as the manner of some is</HI> <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Heb. x, 25.</NOTE> Put forth your utmost exer∣tions, in the use of all proper means and regular me∣thods to procure, as soon as lies within your power, a pious, faithful, judicious PASTOR. And if, through the divine blessing, you should obtain such a one, be careful to <HI>pray</HI> for him—diligently attend on his mi∣nistry—treat him with <HI>kindness tenderness,</HI> and <HI>can∣dour</HI>—endeavour, as far as possible, to comfort, sup∣port, encourage, and assist him in his <HI>arduous</HI> work; and give him such <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>respect</HI> as is suitable to his <HI>character.</HI> For you must be sensible, that one, who, from whatever cause, is <HI>slighted</HI> and <HI>despised,</HI> can have but a very small influence in speaking; even tho' what he says should be of the greatest importance
<PB N="23" REF="021351_0022_0FB31A9AD316F680"/>
in itself, and most interesting to those to whom it is spoken. Endeavour, therefore, to obtain one who is really worthy of your regard, and then be careful to pay him that regard of which he is worthy.</P>
<P>And should you be so happy as to have one among you, who (to use the language of the Apostle) <HI>sows unto you</HI> spiritual <HI>things.</HI> You must not think <HI>it a great thing that he should reap your</HI> carnal <HI>things—For who goeth a warfare, any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?— Do ye not know that they who mi∣nister about holy things, live of the things of the temple? and they who wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar? Even so</HI> (i. e. in the same way) <HI>hath the LORD ordain'd</HI> (for it is not the mere invent on of men) <HI>that they who preach the gospel, should live of the gospel. For the labourer is worthy of his hire.</HI></P>
<P>Let me intreat you, my dear friends and brethren, to cultivate, among yourselves, to the utmost of your power, a spirit of love and friendship, union, peace, and harmony. Let all contentions and angry dis∣putes be laid aside, and all prejudices and animosities be buried in lasting oblivion. <HI>Forgetting those things that are behind and reaching forth unto those things that are before, press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus</HI> <NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii, 13.</NOTE> <HI>Lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset you, and run with patience the race that is set before you. Looking unto Jesus, the</HI> author <HI>and</HI> finisher <HI>of your</HI> faith: <HI>who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, des∣pising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</HI><NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>Animated by the glorious motives, which are set before you by him, who is <HI>the author of eternal salva∣tion unto all them that obey him.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Heb. v, 9.</NOTE> Vigorously pur∣sue your duty in all its various branches.</P>
<P>Be much engaged in sincere and fervent prayer—

in secret, private, and public. Frequently read, and seriously meditate in the word of God —being always deeply sensible of your constant need of special divine influence, continually apply to the Father, in the name of the Son, for the direction and assistance of the Holy Spirit. Ever keep in view that solemn and important day, when we must all meet at the awful bar of our final JUDGE, to give an account, each one for himself, of the improvement of our time, and all the opportunities we here enjoy.</P>
<P><HI>Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on THESE THINGS.</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Phil. iv, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have now finished what I proposed to say at this time, on the <HI>doctrines</HI> you must <HI>know,</HI> and the <HI>duties</HI> you must <HI>do,</HI> in order to be <HI>happy.</HI></P>
<P>What now remains is, asking an interest in the prayers of all the true children of God—committing myself, thro' the merits of the Saviour, to the divine care and protection; and commending you to God, and the word of his grace—to solemnly bid you <HI>all</HI> FAREWELL.</P>
