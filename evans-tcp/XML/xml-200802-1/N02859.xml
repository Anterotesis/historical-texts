<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was with no small Difficulty that the Author's Youth and Modesty were prevail'd on to let him appear a Preacher in our public Lecture, and afterwards to give us a Copy of his Discourse, at the Desire of divers, Ministers and Others, who heard it. But as we quickly found him a Workman that needs not to be ashamed before his Brethren; our Satisfaction was the greater to see him pitching upon so noble a <HI>Subject,</HI> and treating it with so much strength and clearness as the judicious Reader will perceive in the following Composure.</P>
<P>A Subject which secures to God his great Design in the Work of fallen Man's Redemption by the Lord Jesus Christ, which is evidently so laid out as that the Glory of the whole should return to Him the blessed Ordainer, Pur∣chaser and Applier. A Subject which enters deep into practical Religion; without the Belief of which, <HI>that</HI> must soon die in the hearts and lives of Men.</P>
<P>For in proportion to the sense we have of our Depen∣dance on the Sovereign GOD, for all the good we want, will be our Value for Him, our Application to Him, our Trust in Him, our Fear to offend Him, and our Care to please Him; as likewise our Gratitude &amp; Love, our De∣light and Praise, upon our sensible Experience of his free Benefits.</P>
<P>In short, It is the very <HI>Soul of Piety</HI> to apprehend and own, That all our Springs are in Him; the Springs of our present Grace and Comfort, and of our future Glory and Blessedness; and that they all intirely flow thro' <HI>CHRIST</HI> by the efficacious Influence of the <HI>HOLY SPIRIT.</HI> By <HI>these things</HI> Saints <HI>live, and in all these things is the Life of our Spirits.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="003415_0004_0FF8389D0DC95BA0"/>Such Doctrines as these, which by humbling the Minds of Men, prepare them for the Exaltations of GOD, He has signally own'd and prosper'd in the reformed World, and in our Land especially in the Days of our Fore-fathers; and we hope they will never grow unfashionable among us: For, we are well assured, if those which we call the <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> ever come to be contemn'd or disrelished, vital Piety will proportionably languish and wear away; as these Doctrines always sink in the Esteem of Men, upon the De∣cay of serious Religion.</P>
<P>We cannot therefore but express our Joy and Thankful∣ness, that the great Head of the Church is pleas'd still to raise up from among the Children of his People, for the Supply of His Churches, those who assert &amp; maintain these Evangelical Principles; and that our Churches, (notwith∣standing all their Degeneracies) have still a high Value for such Principles, and for those who publickly own and teach them.</P>
<P>And as we cannot but wish and pray that the <HI>College</HI> in the neighbouring Colony, (as well as our own,) may be a fruitful Mother of many such Sons as the Author, by the Blessing of Heaven on the Care of their present worthy <HI>Rector;</HI> so we heartily rejoyce in the special Favour of Pro∣vidence in bestowing such a rich Gift on the happy Church of <HI>Northampton,</HI> which has for so many Lustres of Years flourished under the Influence of such pious Doctrines, taught them in the excellent Ministry of their late venerable Pastor, whose Gifts &amp; Spirit, we hope will long live &amp; shine in this his Grandson, to the End that they may abound yet▪ there in all the lovely fruits of Evangelical Humility and Thankfulness, to the Glory of GOD.</P>
<P>To His Blessing we commit them all, with this Discourse, and every one that reads it; and are</P>

<HEAD>GOD Glorified in Man's Dependance.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 COR. 1.29, 30, 31.</HI></BIBL>
<P>That no Flesh should Glory in his Presence. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctifi∣cation, and Redemption: That according as it is written, He that glorieth let him glory in the Lord.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOSE Christians to whom the Apostle directed this Epistle, dwelt in a Part of the World where human Wisdom was in great Repute; as the Apostle observes in the 22. Verse of this Chap∣ter, <HI>The Greeks seek after Wisdom. Corinth</HI> was not far from <HI>Athens,</HI> that had been for many Ages the most famous Seat of Philosophy and Learning in the World.</P>
<P>The Apostle therefore observes to them how that God by the Gospel destroyed, and <HI>brought to nought,</HI> their human Wisdom. The Learned Gre∣cians, and their great Philosophers, by all their Wisdom did not know God, they were not able to find out the Truth in divine Things. But after they had done their utmost to no Effect, it
<PB N="2" REF="003415_0005_0FF838A02684DED0"/>
pleased God at length, to reveal himself by the Gospel which they accounted Foolishness: He <HI>chose the foolish things of the World, to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and the base things of the world, and things that are despised, yea and things which are not; to bring to nought the things that are.</HI> And the Apostle informs them why he thus did, in the Verse of the Text, <HI>That no Flesh should glo∣ry in his Presence</HI> &amp;c. —</P>
<P>In which Words may be observed,</P>
<P N="1">1. What God aims at in the Disposition of things in the Affair of Redemption, viz. that Man should not glory in himself, but alone in God; <HI>That no Flesh should glory in his Presence, — that according as it is written he that glories let him glory in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. How this End is attained in the Work of Redemption, viz. by that absolute and immedi∣ate Dependance which Men have upon God in that Work, for all their Good. Inasmuch as,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> All the Good that they have is in and through Christ; He <HI>is made unto us Wisdom, Righ∣teousness, Sanctification, and Redemption.</HI> All the Good of the fallen and redeemed Creature is con∣cerned in these four things, and can't be better distributed than into them; but Christ is each of them to us, and we have none of them any other∣wise than in him. <HI>He is made of God unto us Wis∣dom</HI>: In him are all the proper Good, and true Excellency of the Understanding. Wisdom was a thing that the Greeks admired; but Christ is the true Light of the World, 'tis through him alone that true Wisdom is imparted to the Mind. 'Tis in and by Christ that we have <HI>Righteousness</HI>: 'Tis by being in him that we are justified, have our
<PB N="3" REF="003415_0005_0FF838A02684DED0"/>
Sins pardoned, and are received as righteous into God's Favour. 'Tis by Christ that we have <HI>Sancti∣fication</HI>: We have in him true Excellency of Heart, as well as of Understanding; and He is made un∣to us inherent as well as imputed Righteousness. 'Tis by Christ that we have <HI>Redemption,</HI> or the actual Deliverance from all Misery, and the Be∣stowment of all Happiness and Glory. Thus we have all our Good by Christ who is God.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Another Instance wherein our Depen∣dance on God for all our Good appears, is this, That 'tis God that has given us Christ, that we might have these Benefits through him; he <HI>of God is made unto us Wisdom, Righteousness</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> 'Tis <HI>of him</HI> that we are <HI>in Christ Jesus,</HI> and come to have an Interest in him, and so do receive those Blessings which he is made unto us. 'Tis God that gives us Faith whereby we close with Christ.</P>
<P>So that in this Verse is shewn our Dependance on each Person in the Trinity for all our Good. We are dependent on Christ the Son of God, as he is our <HI>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption.</HI> We are dependent on the Father, who has given us Christ, &amp; made him to be these things to us. We are dependent on the Holy Ghost, for 'tis <HI>of him that we are in Christ Jesus</HI>; 'tis the Spirit of God that gives Faith in him, where∣by we receive him, and close with him.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> GOD is glorified in the Work of Redemp∣tion in this, that there appears in it so absolute and universal a Dependance of the Redeemed on him.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003415_0006_0FF838A2EA018A40"/>Here I propose to shew, 1. That there is an absolute &amp; universal Dependance of the Redeem∣ed on God for all their Good. And 2. That God hereby is exalted and glorified in the Work of Redemption.</P>
<P N="1">I. There is an absolute and universal Depen∣dance of the Redeemed on God. The Nature and Contrivance of our Redemption is such, that the Redeemed are in every thing directly, imme∣diately, and intirely dependent on God: They are dependent on him for all, and are dependent on him every Way.</P>
<P>The several Ways wherein the Dependance of one Being may be upon another for its Good, and wherein the Redeemed of Jesus Christ depend on God for all their Good, are these, viz. That they have all their Good <HI>of</HI> him, and that they have all <HI>through</HI> him, and that they have all <HI>in</HI> him: That he be the Cause and Original whence all their Good comes, therein it is <HI>of</HI> him; and that he be the Medium by which it is obtained and conveyed, therein they have it <HI>through</HI> him; and that he be that Good it self that is given and con∣veyed, therein it is <HI>in</HI> him.</P>
<P>Now those that are redeemed by Jesus Christ do in all these Respects very directly and entirely depend on God for their all.</P>
<P>First, The Redeemed have all their Good <HI>of</HI> God. God is the great Author of it; He is the first Cause of it, and not only so but he is the on∣ly proper Cause.</P>
<P>'Tis <HI>of</HI> God that we have our Redeemer. 'Tis God that has provided a Saviour for us. Jesus Christ is not only of God in his Person, as he is
<PB N="5" REF="003415_0006_0FF838A2EA018A40"/>
the only begotten Son of God; but he is from God as we are concerned in him, and in his Office of Mediator; He is the Gift of God to us: God chose and anointed him, appointed him his Work, and sent him into the World.</P>
<P>And as it is God that gives, so 'tis God that accepts the Saviour. As it is God that provides and gives the Redeemer to buy Salvation for us, so it is <HI>of</HI> God that that Salvation is bought: He gives the Purchaser, and he affords the thing pur∣chased.</P>
<P>'Tis of God that Christ becomes ours, that we are brought to him, and are united to him: 'Tis of God that we receive Faith to close with him, that we may have an Interest in him. Eph. 2.8. <HI>For by Grace ye are saved, through Faith; and that not of your selves, it is the Gift of God.</HI> 'Tis of God that we actually do receive all the Benefits that Christ has purchased. 'Tis God that pardons and justifies, and delivers from going down to Hell, and 'tis his Favour that the Redeemed are recei∣ved into, and are made the Objects of, when they are justified. So it is God that delivers from the Dominion of Sin, and cleanses us from our Filthi∣ness, and changes us from our Deformity. 'Tis of God that the Redeemed do receive all their true Excellency, Wisdom and Holiness; and that two Ways, viz. as the Holy Ghost by whom these things are immediately wrought is from God, pro∣ceeds from him, and is sent by him; and also as the Holy Ghost himself is God, by whose Opera∣tion and Indwelling, the Knowledge of God and divine things, and a holy Disposition, &amp; all Grace are confer'd and upheld.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003415_0007_0FF838A55F946578"/>And tho' Means are made Use of in conferring Grace on Men's Souls, yet 'tis of God that we have these Means of Grace, and 'tis God that makes them effectual. 'Tis of God that we have the holy Scriptures; they are the Word of God. 'Tis of God that we have Ordinances, and their Efficacy depends on the immediate Influence of the Spirit of God. The Ministers of the Gospel are sent of God, and all their Suffici∣ency is of him. 2 Cor. 4.7. <HI>We have this Trea∣sure in earthen Vessels, that the Excellency of the Pow∣er may be of God and not of us.</HI> Their Success de∣pends entirely and absolutely on the immediate Blessing and Influence of God.</P>
<P>The Redeemed have all,</P>
<P N="1">1. Of the <HI>Grace</HI> of God. It was of meer Grace that God gave us his only begotten Son. The Grace is great in proportion to the Dignity and Excellency of what is given: The Gift was infi∣nitely precious, because it was of a Person infinite∣ly worthy, a Person of infinite Glory: and also because it was of a Person infinitely near and dear to God. The Grace is great in proportion to the Benefit we have given us in him: The Benefit is doubly infinite in that in him we have Deliver∣ance from an infinite, because an eternal Misery, and do also receive eternal Joy and Glory. The Grace in bestowing this Gift is great in proportion to our Unworthiness to whom it is given; instead of deserving such a Gift, we merited infinitely ill of God's Hands. The Grace is great according to the Manner of giving, or in proportion to the Humiliation &amp; Expence of the Method &amp; Means by which Way is made for our having of the Gift. He gave him to us dwelling amongst us; he gave
<PB N="7" REF="003415_0007_0FF838A55F946578"/>
him to us incarnate, or in our own Nature; he gave him to us in our Nature, in the like Infirmi∣ties, in which we have it in our fallen State, and which in us do accompany, and are occasion'd by, the sinful Corruption of our Nature. He gave him to us in a low and afflicted State; and not only so but he gave him to us slain that he might be a Feast for our Souls.</P>
<P>The Grace of God in bestowing this Gift is most free. It was what God was under no Obligation to bestow: He might have rejected fallen Man, as he did the fallen Angels. It was what we never did any thing to merit: 'Twas given while we were yet Enemies, and before we had so much as repented. It was from the Love of God that saw no Excellency in us to attract it; and it was with∣out Expectation of ever being requited for it.</P>
<P>And 'tis from meer Grace that the Benefits of Christ are applied to such and such particular Persons. Those that are called and sanctified are to attribute it alone to the good Pleasure of God's Goodness, by which they are distinguished. He is sovereign and hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardens.</P>
<P>Man hath now a greater Dependance on the Grace of God than he had before the Fall. He depends on the free Goodness of God for much more than he did then: Then he depended on God's Goodness for conferring the Reward of per∣fect Obedience; for God was not obliged to pro∣mise and bestow that Reward: But now we are dependent on the Grace of God for much more: We stand in need of Grace, not only to bestow Glory upon us, but to deliver us from Hell and eternal Wrath. Under the first Covenant we de∣pended
<PB N="8" REF="003415_0008_0FF838A958EAD478"/>
on God's Goodness to give us the Reward of Righteousness; and so we do now. And not on∣ly so, but we stand in need of God's free &amp; sove∣reign Grace to give us that Righteousness; and yet not only so, but we stand in need of his Grace to pardon our Sin, and release us from the Guilt and infinite Demerit of it.</P>
<P>And as we are dependent on the Goodness of God for more now than under the first Covenant, so we are dependent on a much greater, more free and wonderful Goodness. We are now more dependent on God's arbitrary and sovereign good Pleasure. We were in our first Estate de∣pendent on God for Holiness: We had our origi∣nal Righteousness from him; but then Holiness was not bestow'd in such a Way of sovereign good Pleasure as it is now. Man was created ho∣ly, and it become God to create holy all the rea∣sonable Creatures he created: It would have been a Disparagement to the Holiness of God's Nature, if he had made an intelligent Creature unholy. But now when Man is made holy, it is from meer and arbitrary Grace; God may for ever de∣ny Holiness to the fallen Creature if he pleases, without any Disparagement to any of his Per∣fections.</P>
<P>And we are not only indeed more dependent on the Grace of God, but our Dependance is much more conspicuous, because our own Insufficiency and Helplesness in our selves is much more appa∣rent, in our fallen and undone State, than it was before we were either sinful or miserable. We are more apparently dependent on God for Holi∣ness, because we are first sinful, and utterly pol∣luted, and afterward holy: So the Production of
<PB N="9" REF="003415_0008_0FF838A958EAD478"/>
the Effect is sensible, and its Derivation from God more obvious. If Man was ever holy and always was so, it would not be so apparent, that he had not Holiness necessarily, as an inseperable Qualification of human Nature. So we are more apparently dependent on free Grace for the Fa∣vour of God, for we are first justly the Objects of his Displeasure, and afterwards are received into Favour. We are more apparently dependent on God for Happiness, being first miserable, and af∣terwards happy. 'Tis more apparently free and without Merit in us, because we are actually with∣out any kind of Excellency to merit, if there could be any such thing as Merit in Creature Excellen∣cy. And we are not only without any true Ex∣cellency, but are full of, and wholly defiled with, that which is infinitely odious. All our Good is more apparently from God, because we are first naked and wholly without any Good, and after∣wards enriched with all Good.</P>
<P N="2">2. We receive all of the <HI>Power</HI> of God. Man's Redemption is often spoken of as a Work of won∣derful Power as well as Grace. The great Pow∣er of God appears in bringing a Sinner from his low State, from the depths of Sin and Misery, to such an exalted State of Holiness and Happiness. Eph. 1.19. <HI>And what is the exceeding Greatness of his Power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty Power</HI> —.</P>
<P>We are dependent on God's Power through e∣very Step of our Redemption. We are dependent on the Power of God to convert us, &amp; give Faith in Jesus Christ, &amp; the new Nature. 'Tis a Work of Creation: <HI>If any Man be in Christ he is a new Creature,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.17. <HI>We are created in Christ
<PB N="10" REF="003415_0009_0FF838AC593CDC78"/>
Jesus,</HI> Eph. 2.10. The fallen Creature can't at∣tain to true Holiness, but by being created again. Eph. 4.24. <HI>And that ye put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteousness, and true Holi∣ness.</HI> 'Tis a raising from the Dead. Colos. 2.12, 13. — <HI>Wherein also ye are risen with him, through the Faith of the Operation of God, who hath raised him from the Dead.</HI> Yea, 'tis a more glorious Work of Power than meer Creation, or raising a dead Body to Life, in that the Effect attained is greater and more excellent. That holy &amp; happy Being, and spiritual Life which is reach'd in the Work of Conversion, is a far greater, and more glorious Effect, than meer Being &amp; Life. And the State from whence the Change is made, of such a Death in Sin, and total Corruption of Nature, &amp; depth of Misery, is far more remote from the State at∣tained, than meer Death of Non-entity.</P>
<P>'Tis by God's Power also that we are preserved in a State of Grace. 1 Pet. 1.5. <HI>Who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</HI> As Grace is at first from God, so 'tis continually from him, and is maintained by him, as much as Light in the Atmosphere is all Day long from the Sun, as well as at first Dawning, or at Sun-rising.</P>
<P>Men are dependent on the Power of God, for every Exercise of Grace, and for carrying on the Work of Grace in the Heart, for the subduing of Sin and Corruption, &amp; increasing holy Principles, and enabling to bring forth Fruit in good Works, and at last bringing Grace to it's Perfection, in making the Soul compleatly amiable in Christ's glorious Likeness, and filling of it with a satisfy∣ing Joy &amp; Blessedness; and for the raising of the Body to Life, and to such a perfect State, that it
<PB N="11" REF="003415_0009_0FF838AC593CDC78"/>
shall be suitable for an Habitation and Organ for a Soul so perfected and blessed. These are the most glorious Effects of the Power of God, that are seen in the Series of God's Acts with Re∣spect to the Creatures.</P>
<P>Man was dependent on the Power of God in his first Estate, but he is more dependent on his Power now; he needs God's Power to do more things for him, and depends on a more wonder∣ful Exercise of his Power. It was an Effect of the Power of God to make Man holy at the first; but more remarkably so now, because there is a great deal of Opposition and Difficulty in the Way. 'Tis a more glorious Effect of Power to make that holy that was so depraved and under the Dominion of Sin, than to confer Holiness on that which before had nothing of the contrary. 'Tis a more glorious Work of Power to rescue a Soul out of the Hands of the Devil, and from the Powers of Darkness, and to bring it into a State of Salvation, than to confer Holiness where there was no Prepossession or Opposition. Luke 11.21, 22. <HI>When a strong Man armed keepeth his Palace his Goods are in Peace; but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him, he taketh from him all his Armour wherein he trusted and divideth his Spoils.</HI> So 'tis a more glorious Work of Power to uphold a Soul in a State of Grace and Holiness, and to carry it on till it is brought to Glory, when there is so much Sin re∣maining in the Heart, resisting, and Satan with all his Might opposing, than it would have been to have kept Man from falling at first, when Sa∣tan had nothing in Man.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003415_0010_0FF838AE79612DB0"/>Thus we have shewn how the Redeemed are dependent on God for all their Good as they have all <HI>of</HI> him.</P>
<P>Secondly, They are also dependent on God for all, as they have all <HI>through</HI> him. 'Tis God that is the Medium of it, as well as the Author and Fountain of it. All that we have, Wisdom, and the Pardon of Sin, Deliverance from Hell, Acceptance into God's Favour, Grace and Holi∣ness, true Comfort and Happiness, eternal Life and Glory, we have from God by a Mediator; and this Mediator is God; which Mediator we have an absolute Dependance upon, as He <HI>through</HI> whom we receive all. So that here is another Way wherein we have our Dependance on God for all Good. God not only gives us the Mediator, and accepts his Mediation, and of his Power &amp; Grace bestows the things purchased by the Mediator, but he is the Mediator.</P>
<P>Our Blessings are what we have by Purchase; and the Purchase is made of God, the Blessings are purchased of him, and God gives the Pur∣chaser; and not only so but God is the Purchas∣er. Yea God is both the Purchaser &amp; the Price; for Christ, who is God purchased these Blessings for us, by offering up himself as the Price of our Salvation. He purchased eternal Life by the Sa∣crifice of himself. Heb. 7.27. <HI>He offered up him∣self.</HI> And 9.26. <HI>He hath appeared to take away Sin by the Sacrifice of himself.</HI> Indeed it was the human Nature that was offer'd; but it was the same Person with the divine, and therefore was an infinite Price: it was looked upon as if God had been offered in Sacrifice.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003415_0010_0FF838AE79612DB0"/>As we thus have our Good <HI>through</HI> God, we have a Dependance on God in a Respect that Man in his first Estate had not. Man was to have eternal Life then through his own Righte∣ousness; so that he had partly a Dependance upon what was in himself; for we have a De∣pendance upon that <HI>through</HI> which we have our Good, as well as that <HI>from</HI> which we have it: and though Man's Righteousness that he then depended on was indeed from God, yet it was his own, it was inherent in himself; so that his Dependance was not so immediately on God. But now the Righteousness that we are Depen∣dent on is not in our selves, but in God. We are saved through the Righteousness of Christ: he <HI>is made unto us Righteousness</HI>; and therefore is pro∣phecied of, Jer. 23.6. under that Name of <HI>the Lord our Righteousness.</HI> In that the Righteous∣ness we are justified by is the Righteousness of Christ, it is the Righteousness of God. 2 Cor. 5.21. <HI>That we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</HI></P>
<P>Thus in Redemption, we han't only all things <HI>of</HI> God, but <HI>by</HI> and <HI>through</HI> him, 1 Cor. 8.6. <HI>But to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, The Redeemed have all their Good <HI>in</HI> God. We not only have it <HI>of</HI> him and <HI>through</HI> him, but it consists <HI>in</HI> him; he <HI>is</HI> all our Good.</P>
<P>The Good of the Redeemed is either objective or inherent. By their objective Good I mean, that extrinsick Object, in the Possession and En∣joyment of which they are happy. Their inhe∣rent
<PB N="14" REF="003415_0011_0FF838B02FC44D50"/>
Good is that Excellency or Pleasure which is in the Soul it self. With Respect to both of which the Redeemed have all their Good in God, or which is the same thing, God himself is all their Good.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Redeemed have all their <HI>objective</HI> Good in God. God himself is the great Good which they are brought to the Possession and Enjoy∣ment of by Redemption. He is the highest Good, &amp; the Sum of all that Good which Christ purchased. God is the Inheritance of the Saints; he is the Portion of their Souls. God is their Wealth and Treasure, their Food, their Life, their dwelling Place, their Ornament and Dia∣dem, and their everlasting Honour and Glory. They have none in Heaven but God; he is the great Good which the Redeemed are received to at Death, and which they are to rise to at the End of the World. The <HI>Lord God</HI> He is the Light of the heavenly Jerusalem; and is the <HI>River of the Water of Life</HI> that runs, and <HI>the Tree of Life that grows, in the midst of the Paradise of God.</HI> The glorious Excellencies and Beauty of God will be what will for ever entertain the Minds of the Saints, and the Love of God will be their e∣verlasting Feast. The Redeemed will indeed en∣joy other things; they will enjoy the Angels, and will enjoy one another: but that which they shall enjoy in the Angels, or each other, or in a∣ny thing else whatsoever, that will yield them Delight and Happiness, will be what will be seen of God in them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Redeemed have all their <HI>inherent</HI> Good in God. Inherent Good is twofold; 'tis either <HI>Excellency</HI> or <HI>Pleasure.</HI> These the Redeemed not
<PB N="15" REF="003415_0011_0FF838B02FC44D50"/>
only derive from God, as caused by him, but have them in him. They have spiritual Excel∣lency and Joy by a kind of Participation of God. They are made excellent by a Communication of God's Excellency: God puts his own Beauty, i. e. his beautiful Likeness upon their Souls: They are made <HI>Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> or moral Image of God, 2 Pet. 1.4. They are holy by being made Partakers of God's Ho∣liness, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.10. The Saints are beautiful and blessed by a Communication of God's Holiness and Joy as the Moon and Planets are bright by the Sun's Light. The Saint hath spiritual Joy and Pleasure by a kind of Effusion of God on the Soul. In these things the Redeemed have Com∣munion with God; that is, they partake with him and of him.</P>
<P>The Saints have both their spiritual Excellen∣cy and Blessedness by the Gift of the Holy Ghost, or Spirit of God, and his Dwelling in them. They are not only caused by the Holy Ghost, but are in the Holy Ghost as their Principle. The Holy Spirit becoming an Inhabitant, is a vital Principle in the Soul: He acting in, upon and with the Soul, becomes a Fountain of true Holi∣ness and Joy, as a Spring is of Water, by the Ex∣ertion and Diffusion of it self. John 4.14. <HI>But whosoever drinketh of the Water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the Water that I shall give him, shall be in him a Well of Water springing up into everlasting Life.</HI> Compared with Chap. 7.38, 39. <HI>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Water; but this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</HI> The Sum of
<PB N="16" REF="003415_0012_0FF838B2B69CE948"/>
what Christ has purchased for us, is that Spring of Water spoken of in the former of those Places, and those Rivers of living Water spoken of in the latter. And the Sum of the Blessings, which the Redeemed shall receive in Heaven, is that <HI>River of Water of Life, that proceeds from the Throne of God and the Lamb,</HI> Rev. 22.1. Which doubtless signifies the same with those <HI>Rivers of living Water,</HI> explain'd John 7.38, 39. which is elsewhere called the <HI>River of God's Pleasures.</HI> Herein consists the Fulness of Good, which the Saints receive of Christ. 'Tis by partaking of the Holy Spirit, that they have Communion with Christ in his Fulness. God hath given the Spirit, not by Measure unto Him; and they do receive of his Fulness, and Grace for Grace. This is the Sum of the Saints Inheritance: and there∣fore that little of the Holy Ghost which Believ∣ers have in this World, is said to be <HI>the Earnest of their Inheritance,</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.22. <HI>Who hath also sealed us, and given us the Spirit in our Hearts.</HI> And Ver. 5. <HI>Now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing is God, who also hath given unto us the Earnest of the Spirit.</HI> And Eph. 1.13, 14. <HI>Ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise, which is the Earnest of our Inheritance, until the Redemp∣tion of the purchased Possession.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> and <HI>Good Things</HI> are spoken of in Scripture as the same; as if the Spirit of God communicated to the Soul, comprized all good Things, Mat. 7.11. <HI>How much more shall your heavenly Father give good Things to them that ask him.</HI> In <HI>Luke</HI> it is, Chap. 11.11. <HI>How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</HI> This is the Sum of the
<PB N="17" REF="003415_0012_0FF838B2B69CE948"/>
Blessings that Christ died to procure, and that are the Subject of Gospel-Promises. Gal. 3.13, 14. <HI>He was made a Curse for us, that we might receive the Promise of the Spirit through Faith.</HI> The Spirit of God is the great Promise of the Father, Luke 24.49. <HI>Behold I send the Promise of my Father up∣on you.</HI> The Spirit of God therefore is called <HI>the Spirit of Promise</HI>; Eph. 1.13. This Pro∣mised Thing Christ received, and had given into his Hand, as soon as he had finished the Work of our Redemption, to bestow on all that he had redeemed; Acts 2.33. <HI>Therefore be∣ing by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the Promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye both see and hear.</HI> So that all the Holiness and Happiness of the Redeemed is <HI>in</HI> God. 'Tis in the Communicati∣ons, indwelling and acting of the Spirit of God. Holiness and Happiness is in the Fruit, here and hereafter, because <HI>God dwells in</HI> them, <HI>and they in God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus 'tis God that has given us the Redeemer, and 'tis of him that our Good is purchased: So 'tis God that is the Redeemer, and the Price: and 'tis God also that is the Good purchased. So that all that we have is <HI>of</HI> God, and <HI>through</HI> him, and <HI>in</HI> him, Rom. 11.36. <HI>For</HI> of <HI>him, and</HI> through <HI>him, and to him,</HI> or <HI>in him</HI> are all things: The same in the Greek, that is here rendred <HI>to him,</HI> is render'd <HI>in him,</HI> 1 Cor. 8.6.</P>
<P N="2">II. God is glorified in the Work of Redemp∣tion by this Means, viz. By there being so great and universal a Dependance of the Redeemed on him.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="18" REF="003415_0013_0FF838B547130CE8"/>1. Man hath so much the greater Occasion and Obligation to take notice and acknowledge God's Perfections and All-sufficiency. The greater the Creatures Dependance is on God's Perfections, and the greater Concern he has with them, so much the greater Occasion has he to take notice of them. So much the greater Concern any one has with and Dependance up∣on the Power and Grace of God, so much the greater Occasion has he to take notice of that Power and Grace. So much the greater and more immediate Dependance there is on the di∣vine Holiness, so much the greater Occasion to take notice of and acknowledge that. So much the greater and more absolute Dependance we have on the divine Perfections, as belonging to the several Persons of the Trinity, so much the greater Occasion have we to observe and own the divine Glory of each of them. That which we are most concerned with, is surely most in the Way of our Observation and Notice; and this kind of Concern with any thing, viz. De∣pendance, does especially tend to commend and oblige the Attention and Observation. Those Things that we are not much Dependent upon, 'tis easy to neglect; but we can scarce do any other than mind that which we have a great Dependance on. By Reason of our so great De∣pendance on God, and his Perfections, and in so many Respects; He and his Glory are the more directly set in our View, which Way so∣ever we turn our Eyes.</P>
<P>We have the greater Occasion to take notice of God's All-sufficiency, when all our Sufficien∣cy is thus every Way of him. We have the
<PB N="19" REF="003415_0013_0FF838B547130CE8"/>
more Occasion to contemplate him as an infinite Good, and as the Fountain of all Good. Such a Dependance on God <HI>demonstrates</HI> God's All-suffi∣ciency. So much as the Dependance of the Creature is on God, so much the greater does the Creatures Emptiness in himself appear to be: and so much the greater the Creatures Emptiness, so much the greater must the Fulness of the Be∣ing be, who supplies him. Our having all <HI>of</HI> God, shews the Fulness of his Power and Grace: Our having all <HI>through</HI> him, shews the Fulness of his Merit and Worthiness; and our having all <HI>in</HI> him demonstrates his Fulness of Beauty, Love and Happiness.</P>
<P>And the Redeemed by Reason of the Great∣ness of their Dependance on God, han't only so much the greater Occasion, but Obligation to contemplate and acknowledge the Glory and Fulness of God. How unreasonable &amp; ungrate∣ful should we be, if we did not acknowledge that Sufficiency and Glory, that we do absolutely, immediately and universally depend upon?</P>
<P N="2">2. Hereby is demonstrated how great God's Glory is considered comparatively, or as compa∣red with the Creatures. By the Creatures being thus wholly and universally dependent on God, it appears that the Creature is nothing, and that God is all. Hereby it appears that God is infi∣nitely above us; that God's Strength, and Wis∣dom, and Holiness are infinitely greater than ours. However great and glorious the Creature apprehends God to be, yet if he be not sensible of the difference between God and him, so as to see that God's Glory is great compared with his
<PB N="20" REF="003415_0014_0FF838B7DD5AF420"/>
own, he will not be disposed to give God the Glory due to his Name. If the Creature in any Respects sets himself upon a Level with God, or exalts himself to any Competition with him, however he may apprehend that great Honour and profound Respect may belong to God from those that are more inferiour, and at a greater Distance, will not be so sensible of it's being due from him. So much the more Men exalt them∣selves, so much the less will they surely be dis∣posed to exalt God. 'Tis certainly a Thing that God aims at in the Disposition of Things in the Affair of Redemption, (if we allow the Scriptures to be a Revelation of God's Mind) that God should appear full, and Man in himself empty, that God should appear all, and Man no∣thing. 'Tis God's declared Design that others should not <HI>glory in his Presence,</HI> which implies that 'tis his Design to advance his own compa∣rative Glory. So much the more Man <HI>glories in God's Presence,</HI> so much the less Glory is ascrib∣ed to God.</P>
<P N="3">3. By it's being thus ordered, that the Crea∣ture should have so absolute and universal a De∣pendance on God, Provision is made that God should have our whole Souls, and should be the Object of our undivided Respect. If we had our Dependance partly on God, and partly on something else, Man's Respect would be divided to those different Things on which he had De∣pendance. Thus it would be if we depended on God only for a Part of our Good, and on our selves, or some other Being, for another Part; Or if we had our Good only <HI>from</HI> God, and
<PB N="21" REF="003415_0014_0FF838B7DD5AF420"/>
<HI>through</HI> another that was not God, and <HI>in</HI> some∣thing else distinct from both, our Hearts would be divided between the Good it self, and him <HI>from</HI> whom, and him <HI>through</HI> whom we received it. But now there is no Occasion for this, God being not only he <HI>from</HI> or <HI>of</HI> whom we have all Good, but also <HI>through</HI> whom, and one that is that Good it self, that we have from him, and through him. So that whatsoever there is to at∣tract our Respect, the Tendency is still directly towards God, all unites in him as the Center.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. We may here observe the marvellous Wis∣dom of God, in the Work of Redemption. God hath made Man's Emptiness and Misery, his low, lost and ruin'd State into which he is sunk by the Fall, an Occasion of the greater Advance∣ment of his own Glory, as in other Ways so par∣ticularly in this, that there is now a much more universal and apparent Dependance of Man on God. Though God be pleased to lift Man out of that dismal Abyss of Sin and Woe into which he was fallen, and exceedingly to exalt him in Excellency and Honour, and to an high Pitch of Glory and Blessedness, yet the Creature hath nothing in any Respect to glory of; all the Glo∣ry evidently belongs to God, all is in a meer, and most absolute and divine Dependance on the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>And each Person of the Trinity is equally glo∣rified in this Work: There is an absolute De∣pendance of the Creature on every one for all: All is <HI>of</HI> the Father, all <HI>through</HI> the Son, and all
<PB N="22" REF="003415_0015_0FF838B96B1CE168"/>
<HI>in</HI> the Holy Ghost. Thus God appears in the Work of Redemption, as <HI>all in all.</HI> 'Tis fit that he that <HI>is, and there is none else,</HI> should be the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the first and the last, the all and the only, in this Work.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence those Doctrines and Schemes of Di∣vinity that are in any Respect opposite to such an absolute, &amp; universal Dependance on God, do derogate from God's Glory, and thwart the De∣sign of the Contrivance for our Redemption. Those Schemes that put the Creature in God's stead, in any of the mentioned Respects, that exalt Man into the Place of either Father, Son, or Holy Ghost, in any thing pertaining to our Redemption; that however they may allow of a Dependance of the Redeemed on God, yet de∣ny a Dependance that is so absolute and univer∣sal; that own an intire Dependance on God for some things, but not for others; that own that we depend on God for the Gift and Acceptance of a Redeemer, but deny so absolute a Depen∣dance on him for the obtaining of an Interest in the Redeemer; that own an absolute Depen∣dance on the Father for giving his Son, and on the Son for working out Redemption, but not so entire a Dependance on the Holy Ghost for Con∣version, &amp; a being in Christ, &amp; so coming to a 'Title to his Benefits; that own a Dependance on God for means of Grace, but not absolutely for the Benefit and Success of those Means; that own a partial Dependance on the Power of God, for the obtaining &amp; exercising Holiness, but not a meer Dependance on the arbitrary &amp; sovereign Grace of God; that own a Dependance on the
<PB N="23" REF="003415_0015_0FF838B96B1CE168"/>
free Grace of God for a Reception into his Fa∣vour, so far that it is without any proper Merit, but not as it is without being attracted, or moved with any Excellency; that own a partial Dependance on Christ, as he through whom we have Life, as having purchased new Terms of Life, but still hold that the Righteousness through which we have Life is inherent in our selves, as it was un∣der the first Covenant: and whatever other Way any Scheme is inconsistent with our entire De∣pendance on God for all, and in each of those Ways, of having all <HI>of</HI> him, <HI>through</HI> him, and <HI>in</HI> him, it is repugnant to the Design and Tenor of the Gospel, and robs it of that which God ac∣counts its Lustre and Glory.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence we may learn a Reason why Faith is that by which we come to have an Interest in this Redemption; for there is included in the Nature of Faith, a Sensibleness, and Acknow∣ledgement of this absolute Dependence on God in this Affair. 'Tis very fit that it should be re∣quired of all, in order to their having the Bene∣fit of this Redemption, that they should be sensi∣ble of, &amp; acknowledge the Dependance on God for it. 'Tis by this Means that God hath con∣trived to glorify himself in Redemption, &amp; 'tis fit that God should at least have this Glory of those that are the Subjects of this Redemption; and have the Benefit of it.</P>
<P>Faith is a Sensibleness of what is real in the Work of Redemption; &amp; as we do really whol∣ly depend on God, so the Soul that believes doth entirely depend on God for all Salvation, in its own Sense, &amp; Act. Faith abases Men, &amp; exalts
<PB N="24" REF="003415_0016_0FF838BB8EBC4EF0"/>
God, it gives all the Glory of Redemption to God alone. I is necessary in order to saving Faith, that Man should be emptied of himself, that he should be sensible that he is <HI>wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</HI> Hu∣mility is a great Ingredient▪ of true Faith: He that truly receives Redemption receives it <HI>as a little Child,</HI> Mark 10.15. <HI>Whosoever shall not re∣ceive the Kingdom of Heaven as a little Child, he shall not enter therein.</HI> 'Tis the Delight of a be∣lieving Soul to abase it self and exalt God alone: that is the Language of it, Psal. 115.1. <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord, but to thy Name give Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Let us be exhorted to exalt God alone, and ascribe to him all the Glory of Redemption. Let us endeavour to obtain, and increase in, a Sensi∣bleness of our great Dependance on God, to have our Eye to him alone, to mortify a self-dependent, and self-righteous Disposition. Man is naturally exceeding Prone to be exalting him∣self, and depending on his own Power or Good∣ness, as tho' he were he from whom he must expect Happiness, and to have Respect to En∣joyments aliene from God and his Spirit, as those in which Happiness is to be found.</P>
<P>And this Doctrine should teach us to exalt God alone as by Trust &amp; Reliance, so by Praise. <HI>Let him that glories glory in the Lord.</HI> Hath any Man Hope that he is converted, and sanctified, and that his Mind is endowed with true Excel∣lency and spiritual Beauty, and his Sins forgiven, and he received into God's Favour, and exalted to the Honour and Blessedness of being his
<PB N="25" REF="003415_0016_0FF838BB8EBC4EF0"/>
Child, and an Heir of eternal Life; let him give God all the Glory; who alone makes him to differ from the worst of Men in this World, or the Miserablest of the damned in Hell. Hath any Man much Comfort &amp; strong Hope of eternal Life, let not his Hope lift him up, but dispose him the more to abase himself, and reflect on his own exceeding Unworthiness of such a Favour, and to exalt God alone. Is any Man eminent in Holiness, and abundant in good Words, let him take nothing of the Glory of it to himself, but ascribe it to him whose <HI>Workman∣ship we are, created in Christ Jesus unto Good Works.</HI></P>
