<HEAD>Some Melancholy and heart-felt Reflections, on the sudden and unexpected death of the Rev. Elder <HI>ISAIAH WILCOX,</HI> Pastor of the Seperate Baptist Church in <HI>Westerly,</HI> who died of the Small-pox, the third day of March, 1793, after a few days illness; which he bore with great patience and fortitude of mind—and is much lamented by his Church and People, and by his Friends in general. And has left a sorrowful widow and family with∣out a Shepherd, as well as his Church; but may the great Shepherd of Israel their Shep∣herd be through time; and safely conduct them through unto the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Canaan.</HEAD>

<L>OH! may this loud and sudden call,</L>
<L>To us a warning be;</L>
<L>To all that are within our walls,</L>
<L>And those that distant be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By a most sore surprising shock,</L>
<L>Wrought by the powers above;</L>
<L>A worthy Shepherd of a flock,</L>
<L>Is late by death remov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who was a patern of the age,</L>
<L>Of grace and piety;</L>
<L>But now has quit this mortal stage,</L>
<L>And here no more can be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tents of ease he long forsook,</L>
<L>Religion did per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue;</L>
<L>And in the vineyard of his Lord,</L>
<L>Much labour did bestow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He to his numerous family,</L>
<L>Most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was and kind;</L>
<L>And may it well remember'd be</L>
<L>By those that's left behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But by a sudden illness seiz'd,</L>
<L>Amidst his worldly cares;</L>
<L>Not many days he did survive,</L>
<L>It proved so severe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mother with her children then</L>
<L>Was pierced to the heart;</L>
<L>To think a friend so near and dear,</L>
<L>And they so soon must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>When none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></L>
<L>For there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The people then he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></L>
<L>All those around his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</L>
<L>And then upon his knees was rais'd,</L>
<L>As was by people said</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And then he lift his soul on high,</L>
<L>By a most fervent prayer;</L>
<L>Which did amaze the standers by,</L>
<L>To hear a voice so clear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From one so near depriv'd of breath,</L>
<L>As did to them appear;</L>
<L>When done he gently laid him down,</L>
<L>And little more was hear'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tongue is hear that can describe,</L>
<L>The melancholy scene;</L>
<L>The near approach of their distress</L>
<L>Of sorrow, grief and pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when on earth his work was done,</L>
<L>He yielded up his breath;</L>
<L>With peaceful mind and will resign'd,</L>
<L>Into the arms of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He's gone we trust to worlds on high,</L>
<L>Where sin and sorrow cease;</L>
<L>And left this tiresome weary life,</L>
<L>For everlasting peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And left to us this tiresome road▪</L>
<L>Where trouble leads the way;</L>
<L>In Abram's bosom for to rest,</L>
<L>Till the great judgement day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To you that are the sufferers,</L>
<L>That here on earth remain;</L>
<L>Remember well your Elder dear,</L>
<L>Who for you spar'd no pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more can he your Shepherd be,</L>
<L>When troubles do arise;</L>
<L>For in the grave his body's laid,</L>
<L>And death has clos'd his eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He in the great Jehovah's name,</L>
<L>Did lovingly invite;</L>
<L>His brethren and followers,</L>
<L>With him for to unite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And leave the tents of wantonness,</L>
<L>And w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k the heavenly road;</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> vain and trifl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng toys,</L>
<L>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the living God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! may it be your chief delight</L>
<L>His cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o embrace;</L>
<L>That he so often gave to you,</L>
<L>When you was face to face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He in the great Redeemer's name,</L>
<L>Did often you instruct:</L>
<L>The great and glorious cause of God,</L>
<L>Never for to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what a da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and gloomy scene,</L>
<L>Ah! what a mournful case;</L>
<L>The pillar of the church remov'd,</L>
<L>And none to fill his place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His seat on earth is empty made,</L>
<L>By God's most sovereign will;</L>
<L>His power's the same and still remains,</L>
<L>And he the place can fill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! may the Lord attend his ear,</L>
<L>And listen to your cries;</L>
<L>And patience give the cross to wear,</L>
<L>If he your suit denies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you the paths of satan shun,</L>
<L>And do his will obey;</L>
<L>He will assist you by his grace,</L>
<L>And speed you by his way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Those heavy burdens lay aside,</L>
<L>That doth you so beset,</L>
<L>With patience run the Christian race,</L>
<L>That is before you set.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And may the God of Israel,</L>
<L>Your kinder Shepherd be;</L>
<L>And lead you through life's stormy wiles,</L>
<L>To true felicity.</L>
