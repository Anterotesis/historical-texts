<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PREVIOUS to entering upon the subject of the following pages, I would merely premise, that I was but a short time in the practice of physic, until I observed the influence of the New and Full Moon, in occasioning the first attacks, and pro∣ducing relapses, in the diseases of the city of Philadelphia. Upon first putting my observations on paper, I intended to have pub∣lished them, without taking notice of any of the authors upon the subjects; but, after shewing my notes to one of my medical friends, a professor, and taking his advice, I suspended the design of printing, until I examined those writers who had ta∣ken notice of the Influence of the Moon on the diseases of the human body in other climates.</P>
<P>These observations are now presented to the Public, supported by quotations from the learned: Some of the facts which I looked upon as my own, were, I find, known before; this, although a disappointment, has strengthened those which I now give to the world; and which, I hope, will meet with a candid examination before they are rejected; for new truths are always at first badly received, because, the celebrated Helvetius observes, "they shock the vanity of some men, and contradict opinions generally received."</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN taking notice of the influence of the moon on the diseases of the human body, I shall make a few observations on her effects in the climate of the United States; show her influence on persons in perfect health; and, in speaking of diseases, follow the systematic order as laid down by Dr. Cullen.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Influence of the Moon. <HI>CLIMATE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ABOUT forty-eight hours previous to, and suc∣ceeding the new and full moon, all nature appears to be affected; a warm south-west wind generally pre∣vails; the barometer sinks to 29 and 28½ and the thermometer rises from 15 to 25 degrees:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Ephemerides of the Palatine Meteorological Society of Mannheim for the year 1781, Mr. Hemmer observes "of the ba∣rometer, the greatest elevation, in the course of the year, coincided with the new moon, and the day after its apogee. All the great∣est elevations of each month, except one, and all the least, except four, coincided with a lunar point, or the day preceding, or the day following one. From the new moon to the full, the mercury has a tendency to ascend; from the full, to the new moon, it has a tendency to descend; it is, also, higher towards the apogee, than towards the perigee of the moon. Of rain and evaporation, it is observed, that the most rainy days coincided with the day prece∣ding the eve of a lunar change, seldom with the apogee or perigee of the moon."</P><P>Under the New-York head of October 9th, 1797 we have the following: "Last Tuesday was a very warm day for the season, the thermometer rising to 78″ in the country, and something high∣er in town; during the day, a sudden change took place in the weight of the atmosphere; the mercury, in the barometer, fell half an inch in a short time: the effect on the springs of the musi∣cal clock, in Mr. Baker's Museum, was so great as to render its movements uncommonly rapid; and to reduce them to their usual celerity, it was necessary to relieve the machinery of fifteen or twenty pounds of its usual weight. The fact is related by Mr. Baker himself, and deserves to be recorded, as a curious and not unuseful fact. The hot unelastic or light air, was observed about 36 hours before the full of the moon.</P></NOTE> a cold

dense and heavy air from the north-east rushes in to supply the place of this rarefied air, which conti∣nues to blow sometimes two or three days, atten∣ded with thick clouds and rain, obscuring the whole atmosphere, and often does considerable damage along the coast and wharves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An antient author says, "the moon, by rendering the air ligh∣ter, lays a foundation for a greater quantity of vapours being raised, and, is therefore, found to occasion rainy weather."</NOTE>: it was one of these storms that prevented Dr. Franklin from observing an eclipse of the moon in the year 1760.</P>
<P>Within the periods, or on one of the two days which immediately precede and follow the new and full moon, high winds, storms,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. Winterbotham, in his account of Bermudas, says, "the storms generally come with the new moon."</NOTE> hurricanes,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Three most violent hurricanes of Great Britain have been pre∣ceded by an eclipse of this luminary.</NOTE> tempests,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The moon is thought by the Indians to preside over tempests.</NOTE> tornadoes, and earthquakes,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>An earthquake was felt at Manchester, Bolton, and Bowdon in Cheshire and other places in England, on July 17th, 1795, at half past three o'clock in the morning: The particulars were published in London on the same day, including the state of the atmosphere, as follow, "the moon had changed the preceding morning at half past seven, the barometer changeable, thermo∣meter temperate, the air obscured with clouds, thick and much agitated with gusts of wind and rain at intervals from the wes∣tern quarter."</P><P>At nineteen minutes past six o'clock in the morning of the thirty first of January 1794, the sun was in an eclipse. At the same hour we had a new moon, and about two o'clock at Goshen, a noise similar to distant thunder, with a tremulous motion of the earth, was heard in this town and adjacent country; it proceeded from north-west, and continued three or four seconds—This earthquake was certainly con∣nected with the revolutions of the Moon.</P></NOTE> are always expected, or if a storm or tempest is then in being, she most

commonly moderates it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Philadelphia Gazette of January 2d, 1797, we have under the New-York head of December 31, 1796, the following fact: "it is an observation justified by long attention, to the course and changes of weather, that the prevailing winds and weather of the last quarter of the moon run into the three suc∣ceeding quarters. We may, therefore, expect, that, excepting slight or temporary variations, the last quarter of the moon will afford a specimen of weather for the three succeeding weeks.— The severe cold weather, and westerly winds, this last autumn, be∣gan in the last week in November, and in the last quarter of the moon. The severe winter of 1779, 1780, began about the same time; very soon after the 20th of November, with a fall of snow in the last quarter of the moon.</NOTE>. Within the periods, our tides in the Delaware generally rise from one to two feet higher than in the intervals.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ramsay of S. C. says, "tides in Ashly and Cooper rivers, in common, rise and fall five feet; but at the new and full moon seven feet."</NOTE> This is so wellknown, that some of our ship-carpenters wait for the periods before they launch their vessels.</P>
<P>I believe the water, when the moon comes towards her meridian, is at its greatest heighth; because the atmosphere, from the elevation of the column of air directly under her meridian, is diminished in weight and pressure; and not more depressed, according to Dr. Franklin, who says, "the tide is a wave, and a wave, a tide in miniature; and that the wave follows her two hours, after she passes the meridian."</P>
<P>The United States are most subject to inundations at the new and full moon; which is to be accounted for by the high winds, occasioning the sea to flow in the rivers with a strong current, which check the tides, and cause them to overflow the low lands.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">On the twenty-eighth of May 1794, we had a new moon, thirty-five minutes past seven in the afternoon, the tide was higher in our river, by three inches, than it has been known to be by the oldest inhabitants.</NOTE> The lakes on our continent are, likewise, it is well known, influenced by this luminary.</P>

<HEAD>Of the influence of the moon on people in health.</HEAD>
<P>The influence of this planet, on the animal eco∣nomy, has been remarked by many authors, from the venerable Hippocratis to the ingenious Darwin, and particularly by the Arabian physicians; by Ga∣len, Baglivi, Van Helmont, Ballonius, Ramazzini, Pitcairn, Mead, Sir Hans Sloan, Floyer, Grainger, Gregory, Balfour, Musgrave, Lind, Wilson, Mosely, Leake, Tyson, Wade, Jackson, Laing, and the late Dr. Smith of New-York.</P>
<P>Within the periods, the pulse is generally more quick and tense than in the intervals; and respiration is more free and easy: hence, an agreeable sensation of heat is perceived, and vigour is imparted to the whole system.</P>
<P>Persons in health appear to drink more at the full and change; a plethora is induced in the system; the appetite of thirst is much increased, and, perhaps, one-third less of the usual quantity of liquor is re∣quired to make a man drunk at this time, than in common. This has been particularly observed by the friends and acquaintances of Mr. J— R—n of this city.</P>
<P>The appetite for animal food is not increased; the determination to the alimentary canal is diminished, while that of the insensible perspiration of the body is much increased; the quantity of fluids in the vas∣cular system is more considerable.</P>
<P>Impressions, made on the senses, excite quicker sensations and reflections. The secretions are en∣creased; and hence, I have often observed mothers and nurses, in general, who are sucking children, afford more milk at this time.</P>
<P>The young and old, from their accumulated ex∣citability, are more sensibly affected than the
<PB N="7" REF="034264_0007_0FFC3EEE70003158"/>
middle-aged. A Mr. Ross, rope-maker, of this city, has a daughter seven years old, who enjoys a good share of health, except at the periods, when she falls in a syncope, which lasts ten or fifteen minutes: when she recovers from this state of insensibility, she enjoys her usual good health until the periods return, when, unconscious, she is seized as before.</P>
<P>In Hartford, state of Connecticut, Dr. T. was found dead in the street: he was going from his neighbour's to his own house, January 31, 1794, and on the same day, hour, and minute the sun was in an eclipse with a new moon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mallet, in his life of lord Bacon, page 147, says, "one singu∣larity there was in his temperament not easily to be accounted for. In every eclipse of the moon, whether he observed it or not, he was suddenly seized with a sudden fit of fainting; which left him without any remaining weakness, as soon as the eclipse en∣ded."</P><P>Sully, in his Memoirs, Vol. 4. p, 285, speaking of the total eclipse of the sun, which happened in the year 1605. says, "this remarkable old man, Theodore Beza, was seized with an illness in the eighty-seventh year of his age, which, before the eclipse of the sun, was very flight, but grew fatal from that moment; and a few days after, put a period to his existence."</P><P>In a note to the above sentence, there are these observations: "many strange maladies, of different kinds, raged at Paris at that time; and together with the eclipse, eclipsed many persons who have never been seen since. Dysenteries, especially, were very mortal and dangerous, and more in other places than at Paris, few who were atacked escaping them"</P></NOTE></P>
<P>On the mind it produces the most powerful ef∣fects;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We are informed by Dr. Gregory, that the full moon had a most wonderful effect on the mind of the celebrated Chatterton, his poetic vein stowing impetuously upon him at this time.</NOTE> as an equanimity of temper, a disposition to cherefulness, and an aversion to anger in people of irascible dispositions; perhaps there may be disco∣vered in the atmosphere, a mixture of airs at the pe∣riods favourable to the intellectual faculties: in this state of the mind, physicians visit their patients and relations; their friends labouring under contagious diseases, and are not so liable to receive infection.</P>

<HEAD>Effects of the moon's influence on diseases.</HEAD>
<P>The revolutions of the moon appear to affect fe∣vers in a very considerable manner, which is of great consequence in their prevention and cure.</P>
<P>The influence of this luminary in this class of dis∣eases, is more powerful on one of the two days, which immediately precede and follow the full and change, than those on the intervening days, or intervals; so, when I shall speak of these periods, I shall conclude four complete days at each.</P>
<P>I observe the most influence, the nearer we are to those periods; with respect to the two, the full seems to have most power, which is agreeable to her situa∣tion and proximity.</P>
<P>The first attacks of fevers, (particularly the bili∣ous, remitting, and intermitting,) are most frequent, their symptoms more violent, and more difficult to cure at the periods.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Benjamin Mosely, speaking of the climate of the West In∣dies, p. 112, says, "and though the moon has unquestionably great influence on crisis, and relapses in continued and intermittent fe∣vers, yet lunacy is almost unknown."</P><P>And in a note, at the bottom of the same page, he says, "In the spring of the year 1777, I remarked that most of the patients whom I attended in fevers, were much affected in the head at every new and full moon; I have observed the same thing often, but never so uniformly as in that year."</P><P>Dr. Robert Jackson, in his treatise on the fevers of Jamaica, p. 58, says, "the approach to new and full moon, appears to be connected with the invasion and relapse of fevers, in a very remark∣able manner."</P><P>In page 63 and 64, he says, continuing his observations in America; "at the beginning of August, 1778, the encampment was at Kingsbridge, where it occupied a very unhealthy situa∣tion; when the regiment moved from their ground in the be∣ginning of November, of one hundred cases of intermitting fe∣ver, which were marked in the almanac, eighty were found to have commenced in the usual period of invasion; that is, in the second and last quarter of the moon. This regiment embarked for Georgia in November, and remained there until the capitula∣tion at York-town. The sentence is concluded by this observa∣tion, "of this, however, I am certain, that even at times of the greatest epidemic sickness, when the connection was evidently weakest, the number of the sick was generally doubled in the pe∣riods approaching to new and full moon."</P></NOTE> Vomits are principally of ser∣vice

at this time, in these diseases, as there is mostly a disposition to puke, from an immense quantity of acrid bile in the primae viae.</P>
<P>The effects of the moon's influence upon the human body, may, in some degree, be accounted for, by a change in the qualities of the air, and not by any supernatural or incomprehensible manner.</P>
<P>The proportion of oxygene empyreal or vital air is encreased, and hydrogene or inflammable air dimi∣nished—first, by the winds that prevail at the periods, which unite, absorb and carry off, an over-abun∣dance of noxious vapours, generated by the calm∣ness, warmth, and closeness of the atmosphere in the intervals, so pernicious to animal and vegetable life: secondly, the rains: thirdly, thunder and lightning: fourthly, by rising of the lakes and rivers, which ex∣pose a larger surface to absorb and attract impure air: fifthly, by the increased perspiration of vegetables, ab∣sorbing impure, and giving out pure air: sixthly, the influence of the light of the moon at night, (con∣trary to Dr. Priestley, who says, "vegetables don't give out pure air from the dark:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Wilson, from experiments, says, "the moon-shine ri∣pens fruits, and encreases the growth of plants."</NOTE>) and seventhly, by the exhilarity observed in people in health; as it is generally allowed, the more pure air, the more the spirits are raised.</P>
<P>Of the bilious remitting, or yellow fever, of the year 1793, the first attacks, relapses, and deaths, were more frequent at the periods, than during the intervals. This was observed of the plague of Nime∣guen, by Dicerrerbraeck in the year 1636.</P>
<P>Persons of weak nerves, and debilitated bodies, are most subject to an attack of the typhus mitior within

the periods;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inaugural dissertation of Dr. James Lind on the putrid fever, and the experience of Dr. Francis Balfour, furnishes ma∣ny proofs of the influence of the full and change in this disorder.</NOTE> when their countenance appears sunk, their eyes clouded and dry, with a high colour, and heat in their cheeks, which show a determination to the head; while the end of the nose, the ears, and extremities are cold; here, if evacuants are not di∣rectly used, a typhus gravior frequently ensues, and may be known by the meagre face, eye-lids closed or half shut, with other fatal symptoms.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The late Dr. William Pitt Smith, health-officer of the port of New-York, in a letter to Dr. S. Duffield, of Philadelphia, says, "the severity of the first attacks, often appeared to determine the event of this complaint; and this severity has seemed, in some instances, to depend on some unknown influence, in a curious man∣ner. I have been astonished to find that a large proportion of the deaths of five successive days, were patients all taken sick within twelve hours of each other, and that most of those who recover∣ed, were severely handled. This remark will be found particu∣larly true in respect to those who were taken sick on the 12th and 13th instant (Sept. 1795.) After ascertaining the fact, I was surprised to find that the new-moon took place in the morning of the 13th, that the thermometer had stood much higher late in the morning of the same day, than at noon, and that for three days, the barometer had not varied in the least sensible de∣gree."</NOTE> Per∣haps the encreased circulation of the fluids, in the system at the change and full moon, renders the body more alkalescent: may not this be the reason why phlogosis, sometimes in a few hours, puts on symp∣toms of gangrene and sphacelus. This was particu∣larly noticed in the case of a butcher in Spring Gar∣den, in the month of January, 1793, who had an inflammation between his thunb and fore finger, about the time the moon was full, when, in a few hours, a gangrene appeared, which put an end to his existence.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dr. Hans Sloan, in the introduction to his history of Jamaica, P. 106, mentions a strange disease in a black woman, whose fin∣gers and toes were filled with bladders of water, which mortified. He also says, p. 107, "I have seen more diseases than this come on exactly at these times, (periods of the moon) but they have generally been epilepsies, or other diseases of the head, and have not been so visible as these vesicles of water above men∣tioned."</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="034264_0011_0FFC3EE5615C8318"/>The exacerbations of the hectic fever, are often more violent, and of longer duration at the periods, than in the intervals, in persons between the age of eighteen and thirty-six, which is observable by the circumscribed checks, while the rest of the face is pale and appears dirty; the pulse being tense and full. I have ordered blood to be drawn at this time with the most happy effects.</P>
<P>Many local complaints, such as head-ach,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We had a new moon on December 18th, 1792, at five o'clock. a Mrs. H—, aged thirty, and a Miss A——F——, aged twenty one, both of delicate habits, were seized, the former on Thurs∣day the thirteenth, and the latter on Sunday the sixteenth, with an accute pain in their heads; and on Sunday, the case of a gen∣tleman aged thirty: the pain was attended with such a delirium that he attempted to jump out of a window. These cases were re∣lieved by bleeding.</P><P>Another gentleman who was seized with the above symptoms, shot at his wife, and attempted to destroy his child about the same time.</P><P>Dr. Alexander Wilson says, "there are instances of particular people, who, from some delicacy of constitution, have most violent head-achs, if they stand a quarter of an hour uncovered, exposed to the full moon."</P><P>Dr. John Leake, on the diseases of the viscera, p. 401, says "pe∣riodical head-achs, as well as fluxes of blood from the nose, lungs, or weaker viscera, also happen more frequently at this time than any other, especially about the equinoxes, when the in∣fluence of this planet is considerably encreased."</P></NOTE> tooth-ach,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Darwin says, "inflammatory rheumatism, with debility, seems to obey lunar periods."</NOTE> opthalmia, obstructions of the glands, spasms, cutaneous eruptions, and diseases of the urinary passages,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Mead says "nephretic cases return at the full moon."

<P>Persons about the prime and vigour of life, are frequently liable to violent and fatal attacks of the ideopathic and symptomatic phrenitis, on one of the eight days of the periodical revolution of the moon; for the action of the sanguiferous system and insensi∣ble

perspiration, at this time, are encreased, the quan∣tity of fluids is more considerable while they are mostly costive; the afflux must be encreased in the ascending, and by the torpor of the bowels, dimi∣nished in the descending aorta. From experience, which I have had, I am disposed to conclude, that evacuants must be more necessary at the periods, than in the intervals.</P>
<P>A greater number of people are seized with the dif∣ferent species of the cynanche, which appear more fatal and dangerous at the periods, than in the in∣tervals of the moon. From my knowledge of the above facts. I have been assisted in preventing, cur∣ing and prognosticating in this destructive disease. T— W— had a child three months old, who appeared from its birth to enjoy the most perfect health, until Friday the 3d of April, 1795; when an eruption appeared on the skin: in the evening the child appeared uneasy with an oppression at its breast; but, on the next morning, (Saturday) the fourth of April, was found dead along-side of its mother: I shall remark, that on this morning, at ten minutes past five o'clock, there was a full moon, and within the periods at this time, two others shared the same fate.</P>
<P>Delicate women, and female children with black eyes and irritable habits, are most subject to first at∣tacks of the cynanche maligna on the periodical re∣turn of the moon, and relapses in the intervals, when the most common symptoms that appear are a syno∣chus sever, attended with delirium, the pulse quick and tense▪ the eyes watery, red and inflamed, the glands, tonsils and uvula tumefied, and put on a crim∣son colour, skin of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinge and full of pimples. From these symptoms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appears to be an inflammatory disease: hence, evacuants may be employed with
<PB N="13" REF="034264_0013_0FFC3EE0D021EDB8"/>
great safety: favourable changes seldom occur until the intervals.</P>
<P>Weak and irritable habits, with a sanguine con∣stitution, and bad confirmation of the breast, renders them more subject to pleurisy at the periods, which in our climate assumes more of a bilious nature at this time, as there is an encreased secretion, and a great∣er quantity of bile than in the intervals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. R—d W—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, of Bedford County, surveyor, in∣formed me, that the beaver have a greater quantity of castor at the new and full moon, than at the intervals.</NOTE>. When the symptoms of this disease are violent and difficult to remove, unless great attention be paid to the evacu∣ation of the primae viae, which I consider to be load∣ed with the redundant bile which acts as one of the exciting causes, it sometimes requires one-third more blood to be taken away during the periods, than in∣tervals, to effect a speedy and effectual cure. In the lower parts of the Delaware state, some people are particular in bleeding two days before and after the full and change of the moon, and think a fatality attends if blood is not drawn at this time. Venae sectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in some cases succeeds better with children than adults at the periods. It is often more proper for wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, than men. Smaller quantities of blood are required to remove inflammatory diseases in ne∣groes, which they appear not so subject to, especially at the period<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as white people.</P>
<P>The gout always begins in a plethoric habit, whether it depends on a particular confirmation of the structure of the body or other causes, as the in∣fluence of the moon at the periods. Hence relapses of this scourge of intemperance are frequent at the periods.</P>
<P>I prefer inoculating for the small-pox at such a time as to cause the eruption to happen in the intervals; this is agreeable to the practice of Dr. Bal∣four; because the danger of the eruptive fever is en∣creased,
<PB N="14" REF="034264_0014_0FFC3EDE8CBE38E8"/>
and most apt to run from the distinct into the confluent species, at the full and change of the moon. On the twenty-fifth of February, 1793, at six o'clock in the afternoon, the moon was full, and I was sent for to see a child eighteen months old, labouring un∣der this disease, who had been laying three days with an eruption: the evening before I saw her, twelve purple spots appeared. A brother to this child was seized with this disease in the intervals, who had them very moderate, and recovered without the aid of a physician. At the periods, the lungs and throat are often most affected, the bloody pustules sometimes appear. The fever, from being an intermittent, fre∣quently degenerates into a continued type; and I have known the contagion, in two cases, to lay dor∣mant sixteen days in the system, and not become ac∣tive until the full moon. I had a patient, who re∣ceived the contagion on the beginning of the first quarter of the moon, and nine days after no symp∣toms of the disease appeared; but two days before the moon filled, the arm was inflamed, a fever came on, and my patient received the infection. Dr. Dar∣win says, "in the distinct small-pox, the vestiges of lunation are very apparent."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Edward Laing, surgeon at New South-Wales, in a letter to Dr. Trotter, says, "when the Pitt left England, on the 17th of July, 1791, she had on board near six hundred souls: we had the small-pox on board when we sailed: ten convicts and two sailors were ill of this disease. On the 28th, as no more convicts had received the infection since we left England, we began to flatter ourselves that the disease had run through all those who had not had it: but I was surprised on the 29th and 30th, to find six or seven more attacked, all within the space of twenty-four hours. As the weather was now more favourable than it had been, my surprise was encreased. On reflection, I could not discover any satisfactory reason for the sudden re-appearance of the disease; having heard something of lunar influence in fever and infection, I was induced to look into my almanack, when I found that the moon had changed about this time; and I likewise found, that, the first ten or twelve attacked, must have happened a month before."</P><P>Medical and Chemical Essays.

<P>In consequence of the attracting power of the moon at the periods, a part of the external pressure or weight of the atmosphere is removed, and the body allowed to dilate itself; hence, debility or relaxation is produced on the surface, which is a predisposing cause of haemorrhagies, causing congestion, plethora, and excitability.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Musgrove relates the case of a haemorrhage from the thumb of the left hand, which happened at the time of lunation.</P><P>Dr. Darwin says, page, 502, "perhaps the venous haemorrha∣gies obey the lunar periods as the catamenia and haemorrhois."</P></NOTE></P>

<P>Persons from the age of sixteen to thirty five, who have a narrow chest and prominent shoulders, and are of a slender, delicate make, and lax fibre, and who are endowed with much sensibility, irritability and quick parts, are most liable to first attacks and relapses of this disease at the periods. In October, 1793, on the day of the full moon, I was called to a Mrs. Lee, aged thirty five, and in October, 1794, a daughter of Mr. Beck, seventeen years of age, and found them lay∣ing on their backs almost exhausted from an exces∣sive discharge of blood from their lungs: in both cases, I was assured that the moon often brought the disease on,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Mosely says, page 545, "the greater haemorrhagies from the lung<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those of plethora, like all periodical heamorrhagies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> their natural course, by peculiar circumstance obey the influence of the moon.

of a pain in the head and rectum, are subject to first attacks and relapses at the periods. On the sixteenth of July, 1795, I was called to see two cases of this disease, in the morning of which day, we had a new moon.</P>
<P>As the return of the catamenia depends on the force of the uterine arteries, impelling the blood to their extremities, and this force is always considerably en∣creased at the new and full moon, I never knew or heard of a woman, whose periodical discharge was not, in some degree, influenced by this planet. The most barbarous nations, and all antiquity, are of this opinion. Hippocrates, Galen and Dr. Mead has made some observations similar to the above.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. E. Darwin in his Zoonomia, vol. i. page 498, says, "the periods of female menstruation, are connected with lunar peri∣ods, to great exactness, in some instances even to a few hours!!"</NOTE> In plethoric females this discharge sometimes proceeds to excess, and produces a complaint, known by the name of menorrhagia.</P>
<P>The amenorrhea usually attacks females, a little after the time of puberty, and generally returns every new and full moon, with an excess of action, in both the arterial and venous systems, with a fever in the beginning; the face becomes pale, and then assumes a greenish, livid or yellow colour; the eyes are sunk in their sockets, with a blue circle round them; the lips are colourless, and the whole body ap∣pears swelled.

<P>Diseases of pregnancy are apt to appear and return at the periods, perhaps from a diminished proportion of oxygene in the atmosphere; and may be relieved by the liberal use of the lancet.</P>

<P>Weakly women, of lax solids, who have had many children, are often liable to an abortion at the new and full moon. Perhaps the reason why we find the same parents produce one child healthy and robust, and another sickly, weakly, and delicate, is, that the former was born in the encrease, the latter in the decrease of the moon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The venereal orgasm of birds and quadrupeds, seems to com∣mence, or return about the most powerful lunations at the ver∣nal or autumnal equinoxes; but if it be disappointed of its ob∣ject, it is said to recur at monthly periods; in this respect resem∣bling the female catamenia, whence it is believed, women are more liable to become pregnant at or about the time of their catemenia, than at the intermediate times; and on this account, they are seldom much mistaken in their reckoning of nine lunar periods from the last menstruation. The inattention to this may, sometimes, have been the cause of supposed barreness, and is therefore worth the observation of those who wish to have chil∣dren. Darwin's Zoonomia, vol. i. p. 499.</NOTE></P>
<P>I shall digress a moment, in order to corroborate this observation further, by a few facts taken from the animal and vegetable kingdoms. First, I have often heard it said, fattened meat killed near the full moon will not shrink from the bone nor decrease in weight, but will look full and plump when cooked, but if killed in the intervals, will do so; I would also observe here, that, animal food, killed at the periods, is rather more alkalescent and of more easy digestion, owing, perhaps, to the encreased circula∣tion of the blood in the animal. Second, young bees, if they lodge in the decrease of the moon, appear to produce little or no honey, and a number die; but if in the encrease, they commonly produce as much, if not more, than the old. Third, oysters, crabs, lobsters and muscles<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This observation is confirmed in Hughes's Natural History of Barbadoes.</NOTE> are more fat and plump at the full than new moon. Fourth, at the periods crabs often change their coats or shells, and clams, at those times, most always change their beds, where they had remained sunk during the winter.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="034264_0019_0FFC3ED359B05AE0"/>From the vegetable kingdom, I shall only men∣tion two, among many facts in my possession. In or∣der to make trees of any kind durable, cut them down on the day on which there is a new moon; the grain will be fine and devoid of sap, but if deferred for a few days, the grain of the wood will be coarse and full of juice. This is attended to by some of the planters of the southern states of America.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marshall, in his Arbustum Americanum, speaking of the oak rags, says, it may not be improper here, to make some remarks with respect to felling or cutting of timber. Long experience I think has sufficiently ascertained, that timber in the third and last quarter of the moon's age, is much more durable than when cut at any other time. That the moon materially affects timber, is a fact well known to those who strip bark for the use of tan∣ners. It is a fact sufficiently well known, that timber whose bark has been separated and pealed round the butt, if done in the de∣crease of the moon, retains its greenness often a considerable time, but if in the encrease▪ withers in a much shorter time. From hence, I think, we may conclude, that the sap of trees has a kind of monthly circulation, ascending in the moon's decrease, but descending in the encrease.</NOTE></P>
<P>The epidemic catarrh, of the fall 1789, and of the spring, 1790, appeared to be propagated a greater distance, affected a greater number of people, and was more universal within the eight days of the change and full moon. I have known whole fami∣lies, and even different animals, attacked with it at the above periods. In many cases, there was an uncom∣mon afflux of fluids to the head, with a considerable discharge of blood from the nose, and in some, the disease was attended with symptoms of pneumonia notha, coma and mania; when the pulse was hard, fever continued, respiration laborious; persons of both sexes, between the age of eighteen and thirty six, of irritable habits, were most subject to the lat∣ter symptoms at the periods.</P>
<P>First attacks and relapses of the dysentery, fre∣quently attend the periods: the fever is remitting, sometimes continued and inflammatory; a nausea is a more frequent symptom at the periods, than in the intervals, from the excretion of a larger portion of bile in the primae viae: bleeding is only necessary, if at
<PB N="20" REF="034264_0020_0FFC3ED062CE5EB0"/>
all, in our climate, to diminish the encreased action of the arterial system, and vomits for the removal of the bile, which should be persisted in, as long as the symptoms that required them continued.</P>
<P>Perhaps the reason why apoplexy so frequently at∣tends the periodical revolutions of this influential planet, is the calm that attends her, occasioning a stagnation of the air and noxious exhalations from our earth; the winds that succeed purify this air: the sudden change of the sensible and insensible quali∣ties of this fluid, by producing indirect debility, which this disease is chiefly founded in, and which encreases the afflux of fluids in the arteries of the head, and produces distention, or more frequently effusion, des∣troys the mobility, or energy of the nervous power in the brain. Hence a stagnation, and its consequen∣ces, rupture, effusion, and death. Of the many and numerous cases which came under my notice, in this city, I shall mention in these observations but three. Friday, May 16, 1793, I visited a young man, twenty-five years of age, who was seized with an apoplexy, which proved fatal in five minutes. On the twenty-second of June, I saw another case, which also termi∣nated in death; and on the thirty-first of Dec. a wo∣man, aged fifty-three, was instantly carried off in the same manner: these cases were within the periods of the moon. In Providence, Rhode-Island, on Monday morning, January thirteenth, 1794, died of an apo∣plectic fit, Miss B— R—, in the bloom of youth and health; having gone to bed the preceding even∣ing well, she was found the next morning affected with this complaint: the moon was full on the six∣teenth instant, at ten minutes past ten o'clock.</P>
<P>That species of apoplexy formerly denominated sanguineous, in which there is a plethoric state of the vessels of the head, attended with red face, laborious respiration, often comes on suddenly at the periods, with symptoms violent and fatal, especially to per∣sons above fifty; whereas the serous apoplexy, with
<PB N="21" REF="034264_0021_0FFC3ECE1D69FFB0"/>
a defect of action sometimes attacks in the intervals. Bleeding is most beneficial at the periods, from the carotic arteries or jugular veins, which should de∣mand our first attention; also should be used to take off the irritation from the brain.</P>
<P>The hydrocephalus internus frequently attacks full, robust, healthy, active and lively children at the periods: in the recent state, there is an intollerance of light from the great sensibility of the eyes, which obliges me to favour Dr. Quinn's theory, delivered in his inaugural dissertation, "that, it depends on an inflammation of the brain, and that the effusion is the effect and not the cause." I have cured one case by bleeding.</P>
<P>Periodical palsies often appear within the periods, (Piso and Tulpius, speaks of her bringing on periodi∣cal palsies,) which are caused by an overflow of pu∣trid bile in the stomach at this time, and which a puke sometimes has cured.</P>
<P>Women, and people of delicate constitutions, are sometimes subject to syncope at the periodical revo∣lutions of the moon, when the face has not that death-like appearance, but is florid, the eyes are troubled, and the mouth is shut; the causes of this disease are to be particularly avoided at this time; blood-letting is absolutely necessary at the periods, a recumbent posture and cold water thrown on the head and face succeeds here, Syncope often attends at the periods; in the recent state of acute diseases, it is by no means a favourable symptom. By attend∣ing to lunar influence, I am enabled to prognosti∣cate with more certainty the return, issue, and cure of these diseases.</P>
<P>Dyspepsia is both ideopathic and symptomatic, whenever it attacks weak and delicate habits, at the periods. It is produced by various causes, as the en∣creased secretion of bile, in the first passages, which act immediately on the stomach, or on it through the medium of the whole system: the sick head-ach
<PB N="22" REF="034264_0022_0FFC3ECBD4246328"/>
in nine out of ten cases, accompanies this disease at the periods; and in some cases the circulation is so languid that the blood stagnates and the face becomes livid, swelled and has an unusual appearance. As there is always an uneasiness in this organ, an emetic is the cure, with an attention to the relation of aliments.</P>
<P>Convulsions often attack and return at the new and full moon, in middle-aged robust men, rather than women or old people: it is no uncommon disease for children to have at the periods<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Pitcairne also speaks of a "violent convulsion of the arm returning periodically twice a year, viz. in March and Sep∣tember, at full moon near the vernal and autumnal equinoxes."</NOTE>. Acrid matters, as bile in the alimentary canal, is the most frequent cause of it in them. There is often a considerable action of the nervous system at the periods, which is to be ta∣ken down by bleeding, vomits and cold air. In May 1793, I was called to see a child five years old, lay∣ing in convulsions, for the first time, within the pe∣riods. This child was bled three times before she re∣covered. Fits at the beginning and close of fevers, and pregnant women, at the periods, are unfavour∣able symptoms.</P>
<P>Strong people, men and children delicately educat∣ed, are often subject to first attacks and relapses of epilepsy within the periods, the paroxysms are at∣tended with highly inflammatory symptoms, which generally continue thro' life. The moon, says Galen, governs the periods of epileptic cases, which is also confirmed by Drs. Pitcairne, Tyson, of Bethlehem hospital, and the celebrated Mead.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. John Leake on the diseases of the viscera, page 400, says "many instances might here be brought to show the remarkable effects of lunar influence in diseases of the brain and nerves. Epi∣leptic fits most frequently occur at the new and full moon; and madmen are then more violently affected with frantic ravings."</NOTE> There are many occasional causes of epilepsy; two of which I shall mention, being the most frequent by the moon's in¦fluence at the periods; first, the periodical occasion∣al recurrence of the plethoric state of the brain, or an over-distention of the blood-vessels of that organ,
<PB N="23" REF="034264_0023_0FFC3ECA4C911E08"/>
which is favourable to epilepsy; and the retention of acrid matter in the alimentary canal, occasioned by the encreased secretion of bile, together with a costive habit. Among many, shall notice but three cases. S— H—, stone cutter, November 18th, 1793, the moon being full, was seized with two paroxysms by ten o'clock in the morning. He told me his fits always returned within the periods. Miss S— A—, aged nineteen, in the year 1785, was engaged to be married to a gentleman from Maryland, who disap∣pointing her by marrying another lady, it occasioned an indisposition in the former lady, in which epileptic fits appeared, and continued after her recovery, re∣turned periodically within the periods of the moon until her death, in the beginning of 1795. Mrs. W—, whose fits were brought on by the loss of an only brother, were continued near twelve years, and were governed by lunar influence. These observations were made from a long personal acquaintance with the above ladies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Darwin says, "the periods of hemicrania and of pain∣ful epilepsy, are liable to obey lunar periods both in their diur∣nal returns, and in their greater periods of weeks, but are also in∣duced by other exciting causes."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The spasmodic species of the asthma, attended with an excels of action in the vessels of the lungs, fre∣quently occurs at the periods; which Van Helmont and Sir John Floyer, have observed:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. John Leake, on diseases of women, vol. i. page 384, says, the changes of air at the new and full moon, especially a little before the vernal and autumnal equinoxes have considerable in∣fluence on the health of all animals. At this time, storms and tempests generally prevail; the air is rendered too light, and being insufficient to blow up the lungs, the blood cannot pass too freely through them. Hence difficulty of breathing and pal∣pitation of the heart, attended with sleepiness and oppression.</NOTE> Bleeding is proper here; also fixed air breathed into the lungs, is some∣times a remedy in this species of this disease within the periods.</P>
<P>I have observed that costiveness, and an encreased secretion of bile in the alimentary canal, to be fre∣quent
<PB N="24" REF="034264_0024_0FFC3EC80452B850"/>
at the periods; now colic is generally produ∣ced by costiveness, and bile is supposed, by Dr. Quere, of Jamaica, to be a frequent cause of this complaint. Hence persons are most liable to first attacks and re∣lapses of colic, accompanied with excess of action in the muscular fibres of the alimentary canal. On Wednesday, May 14th, 1794, being within the peri∣ods of the moon, I saw near six cases of the bilious colic; observing at the same time a costive habit, and the encreased secretion of bile, to be the effects of the moon's influence. One of these cases was a girl, ten years old. I observed it for a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> re∣turn periodically with the full-moon.</P>
<P>Tho' children, from a peculiar weakness of consti∣tution, are more subject to the cholera morbus than adults, yet it frequently affects the latter, attended with more inflammatory and bilious symptoms than in the intervals.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. John Peter Wade says, page 58, speaking of an officer, attacked with the gungle fever in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>hur district▪ "He is still, however, subject to considerable irregularity in the secre∣tions of the bowels, especially at the periods of the moon."</NOTE> We should avoid sleeping with the windows open at the periods, as the weather is changeable, and our perspiration, being encreased, is more liable to be obstructed, and produce this affec∣tion.</P>
<P>Single and married women, of a sanguine ple∣thoric habit, between the age of puberty and thirty-five, are most frequently attacked with histeria with∣in the periods of the moon; when the face is preternaturally flushed, and an excess of action of the arterial system: August the 21st, 1793, at ten o'clock, A. M. the moon was full; at the same hour the next day, was called to see a young woman with histerical fits, of so violent a nature, as to require six or seven men to confine her: she was relieved by bleeding. Dr. Pitcairne and Carolus Piso mentions her influencing hysteria.</P>
