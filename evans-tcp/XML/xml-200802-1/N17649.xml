<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF these pious MEDITATIONS, of so sub∣lime a genius, should be inscribed to any name, there is none but your's must have stood in the front of them. That long and constant intimacy of friendship, with which you delighted to honour her, that high esteem and veneration you are pleased to pay her memory, and the sacred likeness and sympathy between two kindred souls, abso∣lutely
<PB REF="022860_0003_0FBA9EBA9BBD5D38"/>
determine where this respect should be paid.</P>
<P>Besides, Madam, you well know that some copies out of these papers have been your own several years by the gift of the deceased; and the favour you have done me lately by your permission to peruse them, has assisted the correction of these Manuscripts, and would add another reason to support this in∣scription of them, if your fear of assuming too much honour could but have admitted this piece of justice.</P>
<P>I know, Madam, your tenderness and in∣dulgence to every thing Mrs. ROWE has written, cannot with-hold your judgment from suspecting some of her expressions to be a little too rapturous, and too near a-kin to the language of the mystical writers; yet your piety and candour will take no such

offence as to prevent your best improvement by them in all that is divine and holy; and may your retired hours find such happy as∣sistances and elevations hereby, that you may commence the joys of angels and of blessed spirits before-hand.</P>
<P>And when your valuable life has been long extended amidst all the temporal blessings you enjoy, and the christian virtues you prac∣tise, may you at the call of God find a gen∣tle dismission from mortality, and ascend on high to meet your deceased friend in paradise. Nor can I suppose that any of the inhabitants of that blissful region will sooner recognize your glorified spirit, or will salute your first appearance there with a more tender sense of mutual satisfaction. There may you join with your beloved <HI>Philomela,</HI> in paying celestial worship, in exalted and unknown forms, to her God, and your God; and may
<PB REF="022860_0005_0FBA9EC0BAB13520"/>the harmony of the place be assisted by your united songs to JESUS, your common Savi∣our!</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE admirable author of these devotional pa∣pers has been in high esteem among the inge∣nious and the polite, since so many excellent fruits of her pen, both in verse and prose, have appeared in public. She was early honoured, under the feigned name of <HI>Philomela,</HI> before the world was allowed to know Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Singer</HI> by the name drawn from her family, or that of Mrs. <HI>Rowe,</HI> which she acquired by marriage.</P>
<P>Though many of her writings that were published in her life-time discover a pious and heavenly temper, and a warm zeal for religion and virtue; yet she chose to conceal the <HI>Devotions of her heart</HI> till she was got beyond the censure and the applause of mortals. It was enough that God, whom she loved with ar∣dent and supreme affection, was witness to all her se∣cret and intense breathings after him.</P>
<P>In <HI>February</HI> last he was pleased to call her out of our world, and take her to himself. Some time af∣ter her decease, these manuscripts were transmitted to me, all inclosed in one sheet of paper, and directed to me at <HI>Newington,</HI> by her own hand: In the midst of them I found her letter, which intreated me to review them and commit them to the press. This letter I have thought necessary to shew the world, not so much to discover my right to publish these papers, as
<PB N="viii" REF="022860_0007_0FBA9EC3BB4D0F90"/>
to let the reader see something more of that holy and heavenly character which she maintained in an uniform manner both in life and death.</P>
<P>It is now almost thirty years ago since I was hon∣oured with her acquaintance, nor could her great modesty conceal all her shining graces and accom∣plishments; but it is not my province to give a par∣ticular account of this excellent woman, who has blessed and adorned our nation and our age. I ex∣pect her temper, her conduct, and her virtues will be set in a just and pleasing light among the memoirs of her life, by some near relations, to whom the care of her poetical pieces and her familiar letters is com∣mitted.</P>
<P>These <HI>Devout Exercises</HI> are animated with such fire as seems to speak the language of holy passion, and discovers them to be the dictates of her heart; and those who were favoured with her chief intimacy will most readily believe it. The style, I confess, is rais∣ed above that of common meditation or soliloquy; but let it be remembered she was no common Christian. As her virtues were sublime, so her genius was bright and sparkling, and the vivacity of her imagination had a tincture of the muse almost from her childhood. This made it natural to her to express the inward sen∣timents of her soul in more exalted language, and to paint her own ideas in metaphor and rapture near a∣kin to the diction of poesy.</P>
<P>The reader will here find a spirit dwelling in flesh elevated into divine transports congenial to those of angels and unbodied minds. Her intense love to her
<PB N="ix" REF="022860_0008_0FBA9EC804EDDB28"/>
God kindles at every hint, and transcends the limits of mortality. I scarce ever met with any devotional writings which gave us an example of a soul, at spe∣cial seasons, so far raised above every thing that is not immortal and divine.</P>
<P>Yet she is conscious of her frailties too: She some∣times confesses her solly and her guilt in the sight of God in the most affecting language of a deep humili∣ation. It is with a pathetic sensibility of her weak∣ness, and in the strongest language of self-displicien∣cy, she bewails her offences against her Creator and Redeemer; and in her intervals of darkness, she vents her painful complaints and mournings for the absence of her highest and best beloved.</P>
<P>Let it be observed, that it was much the fashion, even among some divines of eminence, in former years, to express the fervours of devout love to our Saviour in the style of the <HI>Song of Solomon:</HI> and I must confess that several of my composures in verse, written in younger life, were led by those examples unwarily in∣to this track. But if I may be permitted to speak the sense of maturer age, I can hardly think this the happiest language in which Christians should <HI>generally</HI> discover their warm sentiments of religion, since the clearer and more spiritual revelations of the New-Testament. Yet still it must be owned, there are some souls favoured with such beatifying visits from heaven, and raptured with such a flame of divine af∣fection, as more powerfully engages all animal nature in their devotions, and constrains them to speak their purest and most spiritual exercises in such pathetic
<PB N="x" REF="022860_0009_0FBA9EC8DAAAF720"/>
and tender expressions as may be perversely profaned by an unholy construction. And the bias and pro∣pensity toward this style is yet stronger, where early impressions of piety have been made on the heart by devout writings of this kind.</P>
<P>It should be remembered also, there is nothing to be found here which rises above our ideas; here are none of those absurd and incomprehensible phrases which amuse the ear with sounding vanity, and hold reason in sovereign contempt: Here are no visionary scenes of wild extravagance, no affectations of he tumid and unmeaning style, which spreads a glaring confu∣sion over the understanding; nothing that leads the reader into the region of those mystical shadows and darkness which abound in the <HI>Romish</HI> writers, under the pretence of refined light and sublime ecstacy. Nor is the character of this ingenious author to be blemished with any other reproaches which have been sometimes cast on such sort of meditations.</P>
<P>I know it hath been said, that this language of rapture addressed to the Deity, is but a new track given to the flow of the softer powers, after the dis∣appointment of some meaner love; or at least, it is owing to the want of a proper object and opportunity to fix those tender passions: But this cannot be al∣lowed to be the case here; for as Mrs. <HI>Rowe</HI> had been sought early be several lovers, so she spent seve∣ral years of younger life in the connubial state with a gentleman of such accomplishments and such circum∣stances, that he was well fitted to be a partner of her joys and cares.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="022860_0010_0FBA9ECA59E3DA78"/>I know also that this soft and passionate turn of religious meditation has sometimes been imputed to injuries and ill-treatment in the marriage state, where∣by the same affections are weaned from an undeserv∣ing object, and poured out in amorous language upon an object supremely worthy and divine. But neither has this reproach any pretence in the present case: That happy pair had souls so near a-kin to each other, that they preserved an uncommon amity, and mutual satisfaction, so long as providence favoured him with life. It is sufficiently evident, then, that in these me∣ditations there is no secret panting after a mortal love in the language of devotion and piety.</P>
<P>Nor yet can it be objected, that it was any displici∣ence and peevishness toward other things round about her, that taught her to express herself with such con∣tempt of the things of mortality, and all the gay and tempting scenes of the present state: She was by no means sour and morose, and out of humour with the world, nor with her acquaintance that dwelt in it: She often conversed freely with the gay and the great, and was in high esteem among persons of rank and honour. But honour and rank among mortals, with all the scenes of gaiety and greatness, were little, des∣picable and forgotten things, while in her devout moments her eye and her heart were fixed on God, the supreme original of all excellence and all honour.</P>
<P>In common life she was affable and friendly with persons of every rank and degree; and in her latter years, as she drew nearer to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, if she avoided any thing, it was grandeur and public appearances on
<PB N="xii" REF="022860_0011_0FBA9ECBCDB6E128"/>
earth. But she never so concealed and abstracted herself from the society of any of her fellow-crea∣tures, as to despise the meanest of her species. She was ever kind and compassionate to the distressed, and largely liberal to the indigent. Nor did she neglect the daily duties of human life under a vain imagina∣tion that she moved in a higher sphere, and was se∣raphically exalted above them.</P>
<P>In short, there is nothing in these papers that can justly support any such sort of censures, though men of corrupt minds may cover the bible itself with slan∣der and ridicule. Let all such readers stand aloof, nor touch these sacred leaves, lest they pollute them.</P>
<P>Though there is not one complete copy of verses amongst all these transports of her soul, yet she ever carried with her a relish of poesy even into her sacred retirements. Sometimes she springs her flight from a line or two of verse, which her memory had impressed upon her heart: Sometimes from the midst of her re∣ligious elevations she lights down upon a few lines of some modern poet, even <HI>Herbert</HI> as well as <HI>Milton,</HI> &amp;c. though it is but seldom she cites their names. At other times the verses seem to be the effusion of her own rapturous thoughts in sudden melody and metre; or at least I know not whence the lines are copied: But she most frequently does me the honour to make use of some of my writings in verse in these holy medita∣tions of her heart. Blessed be that God, who has so far favoured any thing my pen could produce, as to assist so sublime a devotion.</P>
<P>From the different appearance of the paper and ink
<PB N="xiii" REF="022860_0012_0FBA9ECD9A583B70"/>
in some of these pieces, as well as from the early transcripts of several among her friends, it is evident they were written in her younger days; others are of a much later original, though there is but one that bears a date, and that is <HI>April</HI> 30, 1735. They seem to have been penned at special seasons and occasions throughout the course of her life. A few of them bear the corrections or additions of her own pen, which discovers itself by a little difference of the hand-writing.</P>
<P>Though she was never tempted away from our com∣mon Christianity into the fashionable apostacies of the age, yet I am well informed from many hands, that in her latter years she entered with more zeal and affection into some of the peculiar doctrines of the gospel: And it is evident that some of these devotional pieces have a more evangelick turn than others, and probably most of those were composed or corrected in the lat∣ter part of life. The opposition which has of late been made to some of these truths, gave occasion to her further search into them, and her zeal for them. However, I have placed these papers all as I found them pinned up in a wrapping-paper, though it is evi∣dent, from plain circumstances, this is not the order in which they were written, nor is that of any great importance.</P>
<P>Though these writings give us the aspirations of a devout soul in her holy retirements, when she had no design to present the public with them; yet they did not want a great deal of adjustment or correction in order to see the light. The numbers and the titles
<PB N="xiv" REF="022860_0013_0FBA9ED1F75E0E98"/>
are added by the publisher, as well as the breaks and pauses, which give a sort of rest to the reader's mind, and make the review more easy. Here and there a too venturous flight is a little moderated; sometimes a meditation or a sentence is completed, which seemed very imperfect, or a short line or two inserted to in∣troduce the sense where the language seemed too ab∣rupt or the meaning too obscure. Her soul had a large set of ideas in present view, which made every expression she used easy and perspicuous to herself, when she wrote only for her own use; though sometimes her entire sense might not be quite so obvious to eve∣ry reader without a little introduction into her track of sentiments: Upon the whole, I must acknowledge I was very unwilling that this excellent work should lose any degrees of elegance or brightness by passing through my hands.</P>
<P>When the manuscript came first under my revisal, I read it over with the eye of a critick and a friend, that I might publish it with honour to the hand that wrote it, and with religious entertainment and advan∣tage to the world: Nor was this employment destitute of its proper satisfaction. But never did I feel the true pleasure of these meditations, till I had finished this labour of the <HI>head,</HI> and began to read them over again as <HI>devout exercises of the heart:</HI> Then I endeav∣oured to enter more entirely into the spirit of the pious author, and attempted to assume her language as my own. But how much superior was the satisfaction which I received from this review, especially where∣soever I had reason to hope I could pronounce her
<PB N="xv" REF="022860_0014_0FBA9ED360FA6DB8"/>
words with sincerity of soul. How happily did this raise and entertain all my pleasing passions, and gave me another sort of delight than the dry, critical peru∣sal of them, in order to judge concerning their pro∣priety? But I confess also, it was an abasing and mor∣tifying thought when I found how often I was con∣strained to drop the sublime expression from my lips, or forbid my tongue to use it, because my own attain∣ments sunk so far beneath those sacred elevations of spirit, and fell so far short of those transcendent de∣grees of divine affection and zeal.</P>
<P>Let me persuade all that peruse this book, to make the same experiment that I have done; and when they have shut out the world, and are reading in their retirements, let them try how far they can speak this language, and assume these sentiments as their own: And by aspiring to follow them, may they find the same satisfaction and delight, or at least learn the profitable lessons of self abasement and holy shame: And may a noble and glorious ambition excite in their breasts a sacred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> emulate so illustrious an example. Whatsoever ardours of divine love have been kindled in a soul united to flesh and blood, may also be kindled by the same influences of grace in other spirits, labouring under the same clogs and im∣pediments.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will be necessary here to give a cau∣tion to some humble Christians, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would not make these higher elevations of piety and holy joy the test and standard by which to judge of the sincerity of their own religion. Ten thousand saints are ar∣rived
<PB N="xvi" REF="022860_0015_0FBA9ED4EA4240A8"/>
safe at paradise, who have not been favoured, like <HI>St. Paul,</HI> with a rapture into the third heaven, nor could ever arise to the affectionate transports and devout joys of Mrs. <HI>Rowe;</HI> yet I hope all serious readers may find something here, which, through the aids of the blessed Spirit, may raise them above their usual pitch, may give a new spring to their religious pleasures, and their immortal hopes, and thereby ren∣der their lives more holy and heavenly.</P>
<P>That the publication of this little book may be favoured with the divine blessing for this happy end, is the sincere desire and request of the publisher, as it was the real motive of the ingenious and pious writer, to commit them by my hand to the public view. This sufficiently discovers itself in the following letter.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE Reverend Dr. WATTS, at <HI>Newington.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE opinion I have of your piety and judg∣ment is the reason of my giving you the trou∣ble of looking over these papers, in order to publish them; which I desire you to do as soon as you can conveniently; only you have full liberty to suppress what you think proper.</P>
<P>I think there can be no vanity in this design, for I am sensible such thoughts as these will not be for the taste of the modish part of the world; and before they appear, I shall be entirely disinterested in the censure or applause of mortals.</P>
<P>The reflections were occasionally written, and only for my own improvement; but I am not without hopes that they may have the same effect on some pious minds, as the reading the experiences of others have had on my own soul. The experimental part of religion has generally a greater influence than its theory; and if, when I am sleeping in the dust, these soliloquies should kindle a flame of divine love in the heart of the lowest and most despised Christian, be the glory given to the great spring of all grace and benignity.</P>
<P>I have now done with mortal things, and all to
<PB REF="022860_0017_0FBA9ED7DB783618"/>
come is vast eternity—eternity—How trans∣porting is the sound! as long as God exists, my being and happiness is secure. These unbounded desires, which the wide creation cannot limit, shall be satis∣fied for ever. I shall drink at the fountain head of pleasure, and be refreshed with the emanations of original life and joy. I shall hear the voice of un∣created harmony speaking peace and ineffable conso∣lation to my soul.</P>
<P>I expect eternal life, not as a reward <HI>(of merit)</HI> but a pure act of bounty. Detesting myself in every view I can take, I fly to the righteousness and atonement of my great Redeemer, for pardon and salvation; this is my only consolation and hope. <HI>Enter not into judgment, O Lord, with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no flesh be justified.</HI></P>
<P>Through the blood of the Lamb I hope for an en∣tire victory over the last enemy; and that before this comes to you, I shall have reached the celestial heights; and while you are reading these lines, I shall be ador∣ing before the throne of God, where faith shall be turned into vision, and these languishing desires satis∣fied with the full fruition of immortal love. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>I. Supreme Love to <HI>God.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHY, O my God, must this mortal struc∣ture put so great a separation between my soul and thee? I am surrounded with thy essence, yet I cannot perceive thee? I follow thee, and trace thy footsteps in heaven and earth, yet I cannot overtake thee; thou art before me, and I cannot reach thee; and behind me, and I perceive thee not.</P>
<P>O thou, whom unseen, I love, by what powerful influence dost thou attract my soul? the eye has not seen, nor the ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what thou art; and yet I love thee beyond all that mine eye hath seen, or my ear heard, beyond all that my heart can comprehend. Thou dwellest in heights of glory, to which no hu∣man thought can soar, and yet thou art more near
<PB N="20" REF="022860_0019_0FBA9EDDD564BEE0"/>
and intimate to my soul than any of the objects of sense. These ears have never heard thy voice, and yet I am better acquainted with thee, and can rely on thee with more confidence, than on the dearest friend I have on earth.</P>
<P>My heart cleaves to thee, O Lord, as its only re∣fuge, and finds in thee a secret and constant spring of consolation. I speak to thee with the utmost confi∣dence, and think thy being my greatest happiness. The reflection on thy existence and greatness recre∣ates my spirits, and fills my heart with alacrity; my soul overflows with pleasure, I rejoice, I triumph in thy independent blessedness, and absolute dominion. Reign, O my God, for ever glorious and uncontrouled.</P>
<P>I, a worm of the earth, would join my assent with the infinite orders above, with all thy flaming minis∣ters who rejoice in thy kingdom and glory.</P>
<L>Tho' not with them, thy happier race allow'd</L>
<L>To view the bright unveil'd divinity;</L>
<L>(By no audacious glance from mortal eyes,</L>
<L>Those mystic glories are to be profan'd)</L>
<L>But yet I feel the same immortal flame,</L>
<L>And love thee, tho' unseen.</L>
<P>I love thee—Thus far I can speak, but all the rest is unutterable; and I must leave the pleasing tale untold till I can talk in the language of immortali∣ty: and then I'll begin the transporting story, which shall never come to an end, but be still and still be∣ginning: for thy beauties, O thou fairest of ten
<PB N="21" REF="022860_0020_0FBA9EDF9C909B58"/>
thousand, will still be new, and shall kindle fresh ar∣dour in my soul to all eternity. The sacred flame shall rise, nor find any limits till thy perfections find a period.</P>
<P>I love thee, and O thou that knowest all things, read the characters that love has drawn on my heart: what excellence but thine in heaven and earth could raise such aspirations of soul, such sublime and fervent affections as those I feel? what could fix my spirit but boundless perfection? what is there else for whose sake I could despise all created glory? why am I not at rest here among sensible enjoyments? whence arise these importunate longings, these infinite desires? why does not the complete creation satisfy, or at least delude me with a dream of happiness? why do not the objects of sense awake a more ardent sentiment than things distant and invisible? why should I, who <HI>say to corruption, thou art my father,</HI> aspire after a union with the immense divinity?</P>
<P>You angels of God that behold his face, explain to me the sacred mystery; tell me how this heavenly flame began, unriddle its wondrous generation: who hath animated this mortal flame with celestial fire, and given a clod of earth this divine ambition? what could kindle it but the breath of God, which kindled up my soul? and to thee, its amiable original, it as∣cends; it breaks through all created perfection, and keeps on its restless course to the first pattern of beauty.</P>
<P>Ye flowery varieties of the earth, and you sparkling glories of the skies, your blandishments are vain,
<PB N="22" REF="022860_0021_0FBA9EE0E2680778"/>
while I pursue an excellence that casts a reproach on all your glory. I would fain close my eyes on all the various and lovely appearances you present, and would open them on a brighter scene. I have desires which nothing visible can gratify; to which no ma∣terial things are suitable. O when shall I find objects more entirely agreeable to my intellectual faculties? my soul springs forward in pursuit of a distant good, whom I follow by some faint ray of light, which only glimmers by short intervals before me. Oh! when will it disperse the clouds, and break out in full splendor on my soul?</P>
<P>But what will the open vision of thy beauties ef∣fect, if, while thou art but faintly imagined, I love thee with such a sacred fervour. To what blessed heights shall my admiration rise, when I shall behold thee in full perfection; when I shall see thee as thou art, exalted in majesty, and complete in beauty? how shall I triumph then in thy glory, and in the privi∣leges of my own being? what ineffable thoughts will rise to find myself united to the all-sufficient divinity, by ties which the sons of men have no names to ex∣press, by an engagement that the revolution of eter∣nal years shall not dissolve? the league of nature shall be broken, and the laws of the mingled elements be cancelled; but my relation to the almighty God shall stand fixed and unchangeable as his own existence? <HI>Nor life, nor death, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, shall ever separate me from his love.</HI></P>
<P>Triumph, O my soul, and rejoice; look forward
<PB N="23" REF="022860_0022_0FBA9EE2D840E878"/>
beyond the period of all terrestrial things: look be∣yond ten thousand ages of celestial blessedness, look forward still, and take an immeasurable prospect; press on and leave unnumbered ages behind, ages of ineffable peace and pleasure; plunge at once into the ocean of bliss, and call eternity itself thy own.</P>
<P>There are no limits to the prospect of my joy; it runs parallel with the duration of the infinite divini∣ty; my bliss is without bounds; O when shall the full possession of it commence.</P>

<P>Nor hast thou any necessity to flatter thy creatures, or to say kinder things to them than thou meanest to fulfil. Miserable man can bring no advantage to thee, nor has he any thing to claim from thee. By what benefit has he prevented thee? by what right can he demand the least of thy favours? thy engagements are all free and unconstrained, founded on thy own beneficence, and not on the merits of thy creature. While I consider this, my expectations rise, I set no limits to my hopes: I look up with confidence, and call thee <HI>my Father,</HI> and with a humble faith, I claim every advantage that tender name imports.

Thy life, thy being, is engaged: I may as well question thy existence, as thy faithfulness: as sure as thou art, thou art just and true. The protestation of the most faithful friend I have, cannot give me half the conso∣lation that thy promises give me. I hear vain man with diffidence, I bid my soul beware of trusting a false mortality; but I hear thy voice with joy and full as∣surance.</P>
<P>Thy words are not writ in sand, nor scattered by the fleeting winds, but shall stand in force when hea∣ven and earth shall be no more. Eternal ages shall

<HEAD>III. Longing after the Enjoyment of <HI>God.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY God, to thee my sighs ascend; every com∣plaint I make, ends with thy name: I pause, I dwell on the sound, I speak it over again, and find that all my cares begin and end in thee. I long to behold the supreme beauty, I pant for the fair origi∣nal of all that is lovely, for beauty that is yet un∣known, and for intellectual pleasures yet untasted.</P>
<P>My heart aspires, my wishes fly beyond the bounds of creation, and despise all that mortality can present me with. I was formed for celestial joys, and find myself capable of the entertainments of angels. Why may I not begin my heaven below, and taste at least of the springs of pleasure that flow from thy right-hand for ever?</P>
<P>Should I drink my fill, those fountains are still ex∣haustless; millions of happy souls quench their infinite desires there: millions of happy orders of beings gaze on thy beauty, and are made partakers of thy blessed∣ness; but thou art still undiminished. No liberality can waste the store of thy perfection; it has flowed
<PB N="26" REF="022860_0025_0FBA9EE9DD4397A8"/>
from eternity, and runs forever fresh, and why must I perish for want?</P>
<P>My thirsty soul pines for the waters of life. Oh! who will refresh me with the pleasurable draught? how long shall I wander in this desert land, where every prospect is waste and barren; I look round me in vain, and sigh still unsatisfied: Oh! who will lead me to the still waters, and make me repose in green pastures, where the weary are for ever at rest? how tedious are the hours of expectation!</P>
<L>Come, Lord, my head doth burn, my heart is sick,</L>
<L>While thou dost ever, ever stay;</L>
<L>Thy long deferring wounds me to the quick;</L>
<L>My spirit gaspeth night and day:</L>
<L>O shew thyself to me,</L>
<L>Or take me up to thee.</L>
<P>Dispatch thy commissions; give me my work, and activity to perform it, and let me as a hireling fulfil my day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord, it is enough: <HI>what am I better than my fathers</HI>? they are dead, and I am mortal.</P>

<L>In these wild regions, wand'ring and forlorn,</L>
<L>Restless and sighing for my native home,</L>
<L>Longing to reach my weary space of life,</L>

<P><HI>I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord</HI>; when wilt thou let me into thy holy habitation? how long shall I pine at this distance from thee? what can I speak to shew thee my pain, to utter my anguish, when I fear the loss of my God? Oh! speak an assuring word, and confirm my hope?</P>
<L>Transporting moment! when wilt thou appear,</L>
<L>To crown my hopes, and banish all my fear?</L>
<P>Again, O my Father, and my eternal Friend, I breathe out my requests to thee in this land of fa∣tigue and folly! what is this life but a sorry tiresome round, a circle of repeated vanities? happiness has been never seen in it since sin and folly entered: all is empty appearance, or vain labour, or painful vex∣ation.</P>

I have pronounced all below the sun, vanity and vexation; all insipid and burthen∣some. Amidst health and plenty, friends and repu∣tation, thou art my only joy, my highest wish, and my supreme delight. On thee my soul fixes all her hopes; there I rest in a celestial calm! Oh! let it not be broken with earthly objects; let me live un∣molested with the cares or delights of sense.</P>

The ways of man are not at his own disposal, but all his goings are ordered by thee; all events are in thy hands, and thou only canst succeed or disappoint his hopes.

It is thou, my God, thou art the only object of my hopes and desires; it is thou only that canst make me happy.</P>
<P>If thou frown, my being is a curse: Thy indigna∣tion is hell with all its terrors. Let me never feel that, and I defy all things else to make me miserable. I seem independent on all nature, to thee only I ap∣ply myself. Hear me, thou beneficent author of my being, thou support of my life, to thee I direct my wishes, those desires which thou wilt approve, while I ask but the happiness I was created to enjoy. Oh! fix all my expectation on thee, and free me from this levity and inconstancy.</P>

<P>I want nothing when I am possessed of thee; with∣out thee I want all things. Thou art the centre of all my passions; I have no hope but what is thine, no joy but what flows from thee: My greatest fears are those of losing thee; my inmost care is to secure thy favour. This is the subject of my deepest anxie∣ty: Every sigh I breathe ends in thy name, and that loved name alone allays every anguish of my soul, and calms its wildest tempests.</P>
<P>From thy frowns or favour all my joys or sorrows spring; thy frowns can make me infinitely miserable, thy favour can make me infinitely blessed. I can de∣fy hell, and smile in the face of death, whilst I can call thee <HI>mine.</HI> My God! still let me bless the sound, and part with all things rather than renounce my pro∣priety in thee: let me hold it to my last breath, and claim it with my expiring sighs.</P>
<P>Secure of thee, nothing can terrify my soul; all is peaceable and serene within, eternal love and immor∣tal pleasure: I desire no more: imagination stops here, and all my wishes are lost in eternal plenty.— My God! more cannot be asked, and with less I should be infinitely miserable.

<P>With the most thankful sincerity I take hold on this covenant, as it is more fully manifested and ex∣plained in thy gospel by Jesus Christ; and humbly accepting thy proposals, I bind myself to thee by a sacred and everlasting obligation.

and tell to listening angels what it has done for my soul.</P>
<L>I'll sing the endless miracles of love;</L>
<L>For ever that my lofty theme shall prove.</L>
<P>My glorious Creator, why did I employ thy thoughts before I had a being? Why from all eternity was an immortality designed me, and my birth allotted me in a land illuminated with the rays of sacred light? I might have been invoking the powers of hell with detestable ceremonies, instead of adoring the omnipo∣tent God. But when thousands are lost in these de∣lusions, why am I thus graciously distinguished? In∣stead of being born among the shameful vices of im∣pious parents, and an heir to their curses, why am I entitled to the blessing of religious ancestors? Why, when I was incapable of choice, was I devoted to the God that <HI>keeps covena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and mercy to a thousand gene∣rations of them that fear him</HI>?</P>
<P>Why, when I knew thee not, didst thou sustain me? But oh! why, when I knew thee, and rebelled against thee, why didst thou so long suffer my ingra∣titude? Why did thy watchful providence perpetually surround me, crossing all the methods I took to undo myself? Why was I not cursed with my own wishes, and left to the quiet possession of those vanities I de∣lighted in; those toys which I foolishly preferred to all the treasures of thy love? Why didst thou pursue me with the offers of thy favour when I fled thee with such aversion; and had fled thee for ever, if thou hadst not compelled me to return?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="022860_0040_0FBA9F0A0D332A68"/>Why did thy Spirit strive so long with an obsti∣nate heart, which resisted all its motions, and turned thy patience and long suffering into provocation and guilt? Why am I not undone by those pleasing snares in which I have seen so many deluded wretches pe∣rish? Like them I despised the unsearchable riches of thy grace; with them I had been content to share the sorry portion and pleasures of this world, if thou hadst let me alone, and I should never have inquired after thee; but why wast thon found of one that sought thee not? O why, but <HI>because thou wilt be mer∣ciful to whom thou wilt be merciful</HI>?</P>
<P>Therefore again with astonishment and delight I look back on the methods of thy grace, and again I consider myself lost in an abyss of sin and misery; when there was no eye to pity me, no hand but thine to assist me, thou madest it then the time of love. Never was grace more free and surprising than thine is; never was there a more obstinate heart than mine; and never such unconquerable love as thine. How gloriously has it triumphed over my rebellious facul∣ties? How freely has it cancelled all my guilt?</P>
<P>Could I have made the least pretence to merit, or have challenged any thing from thee, the benefit had been less exalted; had there been any foundation for human pride, my corrupt heart would soon have taken the advantage, and have robbed thee of thy honour, by ascribing the glorious work to the strength of my own reason, or a natural tendency to virtue; but here my vanity is for ever silenced. I am lost in the boundless abyss. O height! O depth! O length

and breadth immeasurable! <HI>How unsearchable are thy ways, Almighty Love, and thy paths past finding out!</HI></P>
<P>Let me here begin my eternal song, and ascribe <HI>salvation and honour,</HI> dominion and majesty, <HI>to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever,</HI> who has lov∣ed me, and ransomed me with his blood; ransomed me from a voluntary bondage, from the most vile and hopeless captivity, a captivity from which nothing but that invaluable purchase could have redeemed me.</P>
<Q><L>Infinite love! almighty grace!</L>
<L>Stand in amaze, ye rolling skies:</L></Q>
<P>Bring hither your celestial harps, ye beneficent be∣ings, who amidst the height of your happiness express a kind regard for man: teach me the language of paradise, the strains of immortality.

From whence proceeds this painful anxiety of mind about thy love, and all these intense, these restless desires after thee? Why are all the satisfactions of life insipid without thee? Without my God, what are riches and honours, and pleasures to me? I should esteem the possession of the world but a trifle, or rather my eter∣nal damage, if it must be purchased with the loss of thy favour. Thy benignity is better than life, and the moments in which I enjoy a sense of thy love, are the only happy intervals of my life. It is then I live, it is then I am truly blessed: It is then I look down with contempt on the little amusements of the world, and pity them that want a taste for these ex∣alted pleasures.</P>

I have all the world, and more, I have heaven itself in thee: In thee I am completely and securely blessed, and can defy the ma∣lice of earth and hell to shake the foundation of my happiness, while thou dost whisper thy love to my soul. O blessed stability of heart! O sublime satis∣faction! hast thou not told me that thou art mine by an inviolable engagement, when my soul devoted it∣self sincerely to thee? Does not thy word assure me, <HI>that the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but thy kindness shall not depart, nor the Covenant of thy peace be broken</HI>?</P>
<P>Hast not thou terminated my wishes, O Lord, in thyself, and fixed my wandering desires? Is it for riches or honour, for length of days, or pleasure, that I follow thee with daily importunities? Thou know∣est these are not the subject of my restless petitions: Do I ever balance these toys with thy favour? Oh! no. One smile of thine obscures all their glory. When thou dost bless my retired devotions with thy presence, I can wink all created beauty into black∣ness.

<P>Thou art engaged by thy own tremendous name for my security: My God and my father's God, from generation to generation thou hast been our dwelling-place. I was devoted to thee in baptism by the solemn vows of my religious parents: My infant hands were early lifted up to thee, and I soon learned to know and acknowledge the God of my fathers.

These were the blessed, the glorious titles by which thou didst at first assure my doubtful soul: These were the transporting names I knew and called thee by; and thou hast an∣swered them through all the changes of my life.</P>
<P>I was thy early care; thou didst support my help∣less infancy, and art the watchful guide of my unstea∣dy youth. Which way soever I turn, I meet thy mercy, and trace thy providence; and as long as I live I will record thy benefits, and depend on thy truth; those benefits which have constantly pursued me, and that truth which has never deceived me, and is engaged never to abandon me.

<P>It is enough, replied my transported soul, divide the world as thou wilt, let others unenvied share its glory; thy love is all I crave, I am blessed with that assurance, I am surrounded with the joys of paradise; every place is a heaven, while my beloved is mine, and I am his.</P>
<L>If all the monarchs, whose command supreme,</L>

On this they dwell, it is their eternal theme, <HI>Thou art my God.</HI> Like me, every seraph boasts the glorious propriety, and owes his happiness to those important words: In them un∣bounded joys are comprehended, paradise itself, all heaven is here described; all that is possible to be uttered of celestial blessedness is here contained.</P>

The God, who out of nothing advanced me to a reasonable and immortal nature, and put me in a capacity of being happy for ever?

Could I charge thee with severity, or call thy laws rigorous and unjust, I had some excuse; but I am silenced there by the conviction of my own reason, which assents to all thy precepts as just and holy. But to heighten my guilt, I have violated the sacred rules I approve: I have provoked the justice I fear, and offended the purity I adore.</P>
<P>Yet still there are higher aggravations of my iniqui∣ty; and what gives me the utmost confusion is, that I have sinned against unbounded love and goodness: horrid ingratitude! here lies the emphasis of my fol∣ly and misery: the sense of this torments me, can I not say, as much as the dread of hell, or the fears of

But oh! with what confidence can I approach it? What motives can I urge, but such as carry my own condemnation in them.</P>
<P>Shall I urge thy former pity and indulgence? This were to plead against myself; and yet thy clemency, that clemency which I have abused, is the best argu∣ment I can bring; thy grace and clemency, as reveal∣ed in Jesus, the Son of thy love, the blessed recon∣ciler of God and man.</P>

<P>The groans of the damned , and the darkness of the infernal caverns, would better suit my grief. There to the cries of tormented ghosts, and to the sound of eternal tempests, I might join my wild complaints, and lament the loss of infinite bliss, and curse my own folly: But all the plagues below, if I might speak my present thoughts, should not extort a blasphemous reflection on the divine attributes; for I know I deserve eternal misery, and even in hell I think I should con∣fess thy justice. Thy long-experienced clemency, I am sure, ought to silence my reproaches for ever, and to all eternity leave thee unblemished with the impu∣tation of cruelty.</P>
<P>But oh! what agonies would the remembrance of thy former favour excite? What exquisite remorse would it give me to recal those happy moments when thou didst bless my retired devotions with thy pre∣sence? After I have relished those divine entertain∣ments, how bitter would the dregs of thy wrath be? Whither would thy frowns sink me, after I have en∣joyed the light of thy countenance?</P>
<P>If I must lose thy <HI>favour,</HI> oh! let me forget what that word imports, and blot for ever from my remem∣brance the joys that a sense of thy love has excited: Let no traces of those sacred transports be left on my soul.</P>

<P>Blessed God, pity the soul whose extremest horror is the doom of an eternal departure from thee.

<P>At thy word the pillars of the sky were framed, and its beauteous arches raised: Thy breath kindled the stars, adorned the moon with silver rays, and gave the sun its flaming splendor.

<L>These are thy glorious works, parent of good,</L>
<L>Almighty; thine this universal frame:</L>
<L>Thus wond'rous they: thyself how wond'rous then!</L>
<P>But O! what must thy essential majesty and beauty be, if thou art thus illustrious in thy works? if the discoveries of thy power and wisdom are thus delight∣ful, how transporting are the manifestations of thy goodness? From thee every thing that lives receives its breath; and by thee are all upheld in life. Thy providence reaches the least insect, for thou art good, and thy care extends to all thy works. Thou feedest the ravens, and dost provide the young lions their prey: Thou scatterest thy blessings with a liberal hand on the whole creation; man, ungrateful man, largely partakes thy bounty. Thou causest thy rain to descend, and makest thy sun to shine on the evil and unthankful; <HI>for thou art good and thy mercy endur∣eth forever.</HI></P>
<P>As the creator and preserver of men, thou art glo∣riously manifest; but oh! how much more gloriously art thou revealed, as reconciling ungrateful enemies to thyself by the blood of thy eternal Son?

<HEAD>XVI. Longing for the Coming of <HI>Christ.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COME, Lord Jesus, come quickly; oh come, lest my expectations faint, lest I grow weary, and murmur at thy long delay. I am tired with these vanities, and the world grows every day more unen∣tertaining and insipid; it has now lost its charms, and finds my heart insensible to all its allurements. With coldness and contempt I view these transitory glories, inspired with nobler prospects and vaster ex∣pectation by faith. I see the promised land, and eve∣ry day brings me nearer the possession of my heavenly inheritance. Then shall I see God and live, and face to face behold my triumphant Redeemer,</P>
<L>And in his favour find immortal light.</L>
<L>Ye hours and days, cut short your tedious flight;</L>
<L>Ye months and years (if such allotted be,</L>
<L>In this detested barren world for me)</L>

<L>I languish with impatience to be gone.</L>
<P><PB N="65" REF="022860_0064_0FBA9F3B5AF54690"/>I have nothing here to linger for; my hopes, my rest, my treasure and my joys are all above: My soul faints for the courts of the Lord in a dry and thirsty land, where there is no refreshment.</P>
<P>How long <HI>shall I dwell in</HI> Mesheck, <HI>and sojourn in the tents of</HI> Kedar? When will the wearisome journey of life be finished? When shall I reach my everlasting home, and arrive at my celestial country? my heart, my wishes are already there: I have no engagements to delay my farewell, nothing to detain me here; but wander an unacquainted pilgrim, a stranger and deso∣late, far from my native regions.</P>
<P>My friends are gone before, and are now triumph∣ing in the skies, secure of the conquest, possest of the rewards of victory. They survey the field of battle, and look back with pleasure on the distant danger: Death and hell forever vanquished, leave them in the possession of endless tranquillity and joy; while I, beset with a thousand snares, and tired with continual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unsteadily maintain the field, till active faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in, assures me of the conquest, and shews me the immortal crown.

<HEAD>XVII. Seeking after an absent <HI>God.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OH! let not the Lord be angry, and I who am but dust will speak! Why dost thou withdraw thyself, and suffer me to pursue thee in vain? If I am surrounded with thy immensity, why am I thus in∣sensible of thee? Why do I not find thee, if thou art every where present? I search thee in the temple, where thou hast often met me; there I have seen the traces of thy majesty and beauty; but those sacred visions bless my sight no more. I search thee in my secret retirements, where I have called upon thy name, and have often heard the whispers of thy voice; that celestial conversation hath often reached and raptured my soul, but I am solaced no more with those divine condescensions; I listen, but I hear those gentle sounds no more; I pine and languish, but thou fliest me; still I wither in thy absence, as a drooping plant for the reviving sun.</P>
<P>O when wilt thou scatter this melancholy darkness? When shall the shadows flee before thee? When shall
<PB N="67" REF="022860_0066_0FBA9F3DD81FFAC8"/>
the cheerful glory of thy grace dawn upon my mind at thy approach? I shall revive at thy light? my vital spirits will confess thy presence; grief and anxiety will vanish before thee, and immortal joys surround my soul.</P>
<P>Where thou art present, heaven and happiness en∣sue; hell and damnation fill the breast where thou art absent. While God withdraws I am encompassed with darkness and despair; the sun and stars shine with an uncomfortable lustre, the faces of my friends grow tiresome; the smiles of angels would fail to cheer my languishing spirit. I grow unacquainted with tranquillity; peace and joy are empty sounds to me, and words without a meaning.</P>
<P>Tell me not of glory and pleasure, there are no such things without my God; while he withdraws, what delight can these trifles afford? All that amuses man∣kind, are but dreams of happiness, shades and fantas∣tic appearances: What compensation can they make for an infinite good departed? All nature cannot re∣pair my loss: Heaven and earth would offer their treasures in vain; not all the kingdoms of this world, nor the thrones of archangels, could give me a recom∣pence for an absent God.</P>
<P>O where can my grief find redress? whence can I draw satisfaction when the fountain of joy seals up its streams? My sorrows are hopeless till he return; with∣out him my night will never see a dawn, but extend to everlasting darkness: Content and joy will be eter∣nal strangers to my breast. Had I all things with∣in the compass of creation to delight me, his frowns
<PB N="68" REF="022860_0067_0FBA9F3F4E68E378"/>
would blast the whole enjoyment; unreconciled to God, my soul would be for ever at variance with itself.</P>
<P>Even now, while I believe thy glory hid from me but with a transient eclipse, while I wait for thy re∣turn, as for the dawning day, my soul suffers inex∣pressible agonies at the delay; the minutes seem to linger, and days are lengthened into ages: But, Lord, what keener anguish should I feel, did I think thy presence had totally forsaken me, did I imagine thy glory should no more arise on my soul? My spirits fail at the supposition; I cannot face the dreadful apprehensions of my God for ever gone. Is it not hell in its most horrid prospect? eternal darkness, and the undying worm, infinite ruin and irreparable dam∣age? Compared to this, what were all the plagues that earth could threaten, or hell invent? what is disgrace, and poverty, and pain? what is all that mor∣tals fear, real or imaginary evils? they are nothing compared to the terrors which the thought of losing my God excites.</P>
<P>O thou, who art my boundless treasure, my infinite delight, my all, my ineffable portion, can I part with thee? I may see without light, and breathe without air, sooner than be blessed without my God. Hap∣piness separate from thee were a contradiction, an im∣possibility (if I dare speak it) to omnipotence itself. I feel a flame which the most glorious creation could not satisfy; an emptiness which nothing but infinite love could fill. I must find thee, or weary myself in an eternal pursuit. Nothing shall divert me in the endless search, no obstacle shall fright me back, no
<PB N="69" REF="022860_0068_0FBA9F447A28EA80"/>

<HEAD>XVIII. Appeals to <HI>God</HI> concerning the Su∣premacy of Love to him.</HEAD>
<P>O GOD, when I cease to love and praise thee, let me cease to breathe and live; when I forget thee, let me forget the name of happiness, and let eve∣ry pleasing idea be razed from my memory. When thou art not my supreme delight, let all things else deceive me; let me grow unacquainted with peace, and seek repose in vain: let delusions mock my gay∣est hopes, let my desires find no satisfaction, till they are terminated all in thee. When I forget the satis∣factions of thy love, O my God, let pleasure be a stranger to my soul; when I prefer not that to my chiefest joy, let me be insensible of all delight; when thy benignity is not dearer to me than life, let that life become my burden and my pain.</P>
<P>Search the inmost recesses of my heart, and if thou findest any competitor there, remove the darling van∣ity, and blot every name but thine from my breast. Let me find nothing but emptiness in the creature, when I forsake the all-sufficient Creator: let the streams be cut off, when I wander away and abandon

the fountain. Let me be destitute of assistance, when I cease to rely on thee; let my lips be for ever silent, when they refuse to acknowledge thy benefits, and make not thee the subject of their highest praise. Let no joyful strain enter at my ears, when thy name is not the most delightful sound they can convey to my heart.</P>
<P>I have been pronouncing heavy curses on myself, if thy love be not my chief blessing; yet, O my dear∣est good, my portion, and my only felicity, might I not go on farther still, and even venture immortal joys on the sincerity of my love to thee? Blessed Lord, forgive these dangerous efforts of a mortal tongue, which are the mere out-breakings of a fervent affec∣tion. I could even dare to pledge all my hopes and my pretensions to future happiness, (and O let not my heart deceive me) I think I could risk them all, if thou thyself art not the object of my brightest hopes, and the light of thy countenance the height of that expected happiness.</P>
<P>If I desire any thing in heaven or on earth in com∣parison of thee, I am almost ready to say, banish me as an eternal exile from the light of paradise: Even that paradise would be melancholy darkness without thee, and the obscurest corner of the creation, blessed with thy presence, would be more agreeable. Oh! where could I be happy, remote from thee? what imaginable good could supply thy absence? Say, O my God, do I not love thee?</P>
<P>Shall I call the holy angels to witness? shall I call heaven and earth to witness? will not the most high

<P>With what pleasure do I reflect on the obligations by which I have devoted myself to thee? My soul collects itself, and with an entire assent gives up all its powers to thee: I would bind myself to thee beyond all the ties that mortals know. You ministers of light, give me your flames, and teach me your celes∣tial forms; let all be noble and pathetic, and solemn as your own immortal vows, and I will joyfully go through them all to bind myself to my God for ever.

<P>THOU radiant sun, thou moon, and all ye spark∣ling stars, how gladly would I leave your plea∣sant light to see the face of God? Ye crystal streams, ye groves and flowery lawns, my innocent delights, how joyfully could I leave you to meet that blissful prospect? and you delightful faces of my friends, I would this moment quit you all to see him whom my soul loves; so loves, that I can find no words to ex∣press the unutterable ardour: Not as the miser loves his wealth, nor the ambitious his grandeur; not as the libertine loves his pleasures, or the generous man his friend: These are flat similitudes to describe such
<PB N="72" REF="022860_0071_0FBA9F4899BE06E0"/>
an intense passion as mine. Not as a man, scorched in a fever, longs for a cooling draught; not as a weary traveller wishes for soft repose; my restless desires admit of no equal comparison from these.</P>
<P>I love my friend; my vital breath and the light of heaven are dear to me: But should I say I love my God as I love these, I should belie the sacred flame which aspires to infinity. It is thee, abstractly, then, O uncreated beauty, that I love; in thee, my wishes are all terminated; in thee, as in their blissful centre, all my desires meet, and there they must be eternally fix∣ed: it is thou alone that must constitute my everlast∣ing happiness. Were the harps of angels silent, there would be harmony for me in the whispers of thy love: Were the fields of light darkened, thy smiles would bless me with everlasting day; the vision of thy face will attract my eyes, nor give me leisure to waste a look on other objects to all eternity, any farther than God is to be seen in his creatures. All their beams of grace, and joy, and glory, are derived from thee, the eternal sun, and will merit my attention no far∣ther than they reflect thy image, or discover thy ex∣cellencies.</P>
<P>Even at this distance, encompassed with the shades of death, and the mists of darkness, in these cold, melancholy regions, when a ray of thy love breaks in on my soul, when through the clouds I can trace but one feeble beam, even that obscures all human glory, and gives me a contempt for whatever mortality can boast. What wonders, then, will the open vision of thy face effect, when I shall enjoy it in so sublime a

degree, that the magnificence of the skies will not draw my regard, nor the converse of angels divert my thoughts from thee? Thou wilt engross my everlast∣ing attention, and I should abound in felicity if I had nothing to entertain me but immediate commu∣nion with the infinite divinity.</P>
<P>Mend thy pace, old lazy time, and shake thy hea∣vy sands; make shorter circles, ye rolling planets; when will your destined courses be fulfilled? Thou restless sun, how long wilt thou travel the celestial road? when will thy starry walk be finished? when will the commissioned angel arrest thee in thy pro∣gress, and lifting up his hand, swear by the unutter∣able name, <HI>that time shall be no more.</HI> O happy pe∣riod! my impatient soul springs forward to salute thee, and leaves the lagging days, and months and years far behind. <HI>Make haste, my beloved, and be like a roe, or a young hart on the spicey mountains.</HI></P>
<P>I pine, I die for a sight of thy countenance; oh! turn the veil aside, blow away the separating cloud; pull out the pins of this tabernacle; break the cords, and let fall the curtain of mortality. Oh! let it in∣terpose no longer between me and my perfect bliss.

<L>For you have listen'd, while the sacred name</L>
<L>That kindles in each heavenly breast a flame,</L>
<L>You listen'd while it melted on my tongue,</L>
<L>Flow'd from my lips, and grac'd the midnight song.</L>
<L>Bless'd was the time, and swiftly fled the hours,</L>
<L>While holy love employ'd my noblest powers:</L>
<L>The heavens appear'd, and the propitious skies</L>
<L>Unveil'd their inmost glories to my eyes.</L>
<L>Oh! stay, I cry'd, ye happy moments stay,</L>
<L>Nor in your flight snatch these delights away:</L>
<L>I ask no more the rising sun to view,</L>
<L>To mortals and their hopes I bid adieu.</L>
<P>These heavens and this earth have been witnesses to my vows: The holy angels have been witnesses, and all will join together to condemn me when I vi∣olate my faith. Strengthen and confirm it, O my Saviour, and make the bonds of it immortal.</P>
<P>If I were only to reason upon this subject, I might say, what motive could earth, what could hell, what could heaven itself propose to tempt my soul to change its love? What could they lay in the balance against an infinite good? what could be thrown in as a stake against the favour of God? Ask the happy souls who know what the light of his countenance imports, who drink in joy and immortality from his smiles, ask them what value they set on their enjoyments; ask them what in heaven or earth should purchase one moment's

interval of their bliss; ask some radiant seraph, amidst the fervency of his raptures, at what price he values his happiness; and when these have named the pur∣chase, earth and hell may try to balance mine. Let them spread the baits that tempt deluded men to ru∣in; let riches, honour, beauty, and bewitching plea∣sure appear in all their charms, the sensuality of the present and past ages, the <HI>Persian</HI> delicacy, and the <HI>Roman</HI> pride; let them uncover the golden mines, and disclose the ruby sparkling in its bed; let them open the veins of sapphire, and shew the diamond glittering on its rock; let them all be thrown into the balance; alas! their weight is too little and too light. Let the pageantries of State be added, im∣perial titles, and the ensigns of majesty; put in all that boundless vanity imagines, or wild ambition craves, crowns and sceptres, regal vestments and gold∣en thrones—the scale still mounts. Throw in the world entire—it is unsubstantial, and light as airy vanity.</P>
<P>Are these thy highest boasts, O deluding world? —ye ministers of darkness, have you nothing else to offer? Are these your utmost proposals? Are these a compensation for the FAVOUR OF GOD? Alas! that boundless word has a meaning which out-weighs them all: Infinite delight, unconceivable joy are express∣ed in it; the light of his countenance signifies more than angels can describe, or mortality imagine: And shall I quit all that an everlasting heaven means, for empty shadows?</P>

These winding skies, in all their ample round, contain nothing equal to my desires; my ambition has far different ends, and other prospects in view; nothing below the joys of angels can satisfy me.</P>
<P>Let me explore the worlds of life and beauty, and find a path to the dazzling recesses of the Most High: Let me drink at the fountain-head of pleasure, and derive all that I want from original and uncreated fullness and felicity.</P>
<P>Oh divine love! let me launch out into thy plea∣surable depths, and be swallowed up of thee: Let me plunge at once in immortal joy, and lose myself in the infinite ocean of happiness.</P>
<P>Till then I pine for my celestial country: till then I murmur to the winds and streams, and tell the soli∣tary shades my grief. The groves are conscious to my complaints, and the moon and stars listen to my sighs; by their silent lights I talk over my heavenly concerns, and give a vent to my divine affections in mortal language; then looking upward, I grow im∣patient to reach the milky way, the seats of joy and immortality.</P>
<L>Come love, come life, and that bless'd day</L>

<P>Tell me, ye sons of light, who feel the force of these celestial fires, in what language you paint their sacred violence? Or do the tongues of seraphs faulter? Does the language of paradise want emphasis here, and immortal eloquence fail? Surely your happiness is more perfect than all your descriptions of it: hea∣ven echoes to your charming notes as far as they reach, while divine love, which is all your song, is infinite, and knows no limits of degree or duration.</P>

Can divine love, which exalted me lately in∣to flaming transports, so far subside, and grow cool within me? Can it leave me so unactive as I now feel myself? What shall I do to shame my conscience with reproaches, and renew the flame of religious zeal and vigour?</P>
<P>Alas! how does the activity of men about the lit∣tle affairs of human life, condemn my negligence in matters of everlasting consequence?

<P>Thrice welcome, thou kind messenger of my liber∣ty and happiness! a thousand times more welcome than jubilee to the wretched slave, than pardon to a condemned malefactor: I am going from darkness and confinement to immense light and perfect liberty: from these tempestuous regions to the soft and peace∣ful climes above; from pain and grief to everlasting ease and tranquillity. For the toils of virtue, I shall immediately receive its vast rewards; for the reproach of fools, the honour and applause of angels.

<HEAD>XXII. A devout Resignation of Self to the divine Power and Goodness.</HEAD>
<P>MY all-sufficient friend, <HI>my shield, and my ex∣ceeding great reward!</HI> I have enough: Un∣bounded avarice can covet nothing beyond thee; the
<PB N="83" REF="022860_0082_0FBA9F60F2A49598"/>
soul whom thou dost not suffice, deserves to be eter∣nally poor. Thou art my supreme happiness, my voluntary choice: I took thy love alone for my trea∣sure, in that blessed day when I entered into covenant with thee, and became thine: I made no articles with thee for the friendships, the honours and pleasures of the world; but solemnly renounced them all, and chose thy favour for my single inheritance, leaving the conduct of my life entirely to thee.</P>
<P>These were my vows, and these I have often re∣newed; and shall I now retract such sacred obliga∣tions, and alter a choice so just and reasonable? For∣bid it, gracious God! let me never be guilty of such madness: The world has often disappointed my most confident expectations, but thou hast never deceived me. In all my distress I have found thee a certain refuge, <HI>my shield, my fortress, my high tower, my de∣liverer, my rock, and he in whom I trust.</HI> When there was none to save me, thy powerful hand has set me free; thou hast redressed my grievances, and dissipat∣ed my fears; thou hast brought me light out of ob∣scurity, and turned my darkness into day.</P>
<P>When the world could afford me nothing but tem∣pest and disorder, with thee I have found repose and undisturbed tranquillity. Thou hast been my long experienced refuge, my unfailing confidence, and I stedfastly depend on thee for my future conduct. I cannot err when guided by infinite wisdom; I must be safe in the arms of eternal love, to which I hum∣bly resign myself. Let me have riches or poverty, honour or contempt; whatever comes from thy hands
<PB N="84" REF="022860_0083_0FBA9F620B542968"/>
shall be thankfully received. I would hear no voice but thine, nor make a step but where I am following thee.</P>
<P>If thou wouldst leave me to chuse for myself, I would resign the choice again to thee; I dread no∣thing more than the guidance of my own blind de∣sires; I tremble at the thought of such a fatal liber∣ty: Avert, gracious God, that miserable freedom. Thou foreseest all events, and at one single view dost look through eternal consequences; therefore do thou determine my circumstances, not to gratify my own wild desires, but to advance thy glory.</P>
<P>Thou hast an unquestioned right to dispose of me; I am thine by necessary ties, and voluntary engage∣ments, which I thankfully acknowledge and solemn∣ly renew: Deliberately and entirely I put myself in∣to thy hands. Whatever interest I have in this world I sacrifice to thee, and leave my dearest enjoyments to thy disposal, acknowledging it my dearest happi∣ness to be guided by thee.</P>
<P><HI>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him?</HI> That thou, who art supremely blessed, and independ∣ently happy, shouldst concern thyself with human af∣fairs, and condescend to make our wants as much thy care as if mortal miseries could reach thee, and in∣terrupt immortal blessedness. Thou wouldst make us sensible of thine indulgence by the most tender simili∣tudes: A father's gentle care but faintly shadows thine, and all we can conceive of human pity falls short of thy compassion. Thou dost seem to share in our calamities, and sympathize in all our grief. No
<PB N="85" REF="022860_0084_0FBA9F6395440010"/>
friend flies to our assistance with half the speed that love brings thee, nor canst thou ever want methods to relieve those that confide in thee.</P>
<P>Thy providence finds or makes its way through all oppositions: The streams shall roll back to their fountains, the sun shall stand still, and the course of nature be reversed, rather than thou want means to bring thy purposes to pass. No obstacle puts a stand to thy designs, nor obstructs thy methods: It is thy will that makes nature and necessity: Who can stay thy hand, or say unto thee, <HI>What dost thou?</HI> Thy counsel shall stand, and thou wilt do all thy pleasure. Nothing is impossible for thee to accomplish? Where∣ever I cast my eyes, I see instances of thy power: The extended firmament, the sun and stars, tell me what thou art able to perform; they attest thy om∣nipotence, and rebuke my unbelief. The whole cre∣ation pleads for thee, and condemns my infidelity.</P>
<P>Almighty God, forgive my diffidence, while I con∣fess it is most inexcusable. Thy hand is not shorten∣ed, nor are the springs of thy bounty sealed; thy an∣cient miracles have not exhausted thy strength, nor hath perpetual beneficence impoverished thee; thy power remains undiminished, and thy mercy endureth for ever. That dazzling attribute surrounds me with transporting glories: Which way soever I turn, I meet the bright conviction; I cannot recal a day of my past life on which some signature of thy goodness is not stamped.</P>
<L>Oh! who hath tasted of thy clemency</L>
<L>In greater measure, or more oft than I?</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="022860_0085_0FBA9F64D51F41D0"/>Which way soe'er I turn my face or feet,</L>
<L>I see thy mercy and thy glory meet.</L>
<P>In whatever thou hast granted, or whatever thou hast denied me, thy beneficence has been mingled with every dispensation; thou hast not taken the ad∣vantage of my follies, nor been severe to my sins; but hast remembered my frame, and treated me with the utmost indulgence. Glory be to thy name for ever.</P>

<HEAD>XXIII. Redeeming Love.</HEAD>
<P>ALMIGHTY love, the theme of every heavenly song! Infinite grace, the wonder of angels! forgive a mortal tongue that attempts thy praise; and yet should man be silent, the mute creation would find a voice to upbraid him.</P>
<P>But oh! in what language shall I speak? with what circumstance shall I begin? shall I roll back the volumes of eternity, and begin with the glorious de∣sign that determined man's redemption before the birth of time, before the confines of creation were fixed:</P>
<L>Infinite years before the day,</L>
<L>Or heavens began to roll?</L>
<P>Shall I speak in general of all the nations of the redeemed? or, to excite my own gratitude, shall I consider myself, my worthless self, included by an e∣ternal
<PB N="87" REF="022860_0086_0FBA9F6651695DF0"/>
decree among the number of those who should hear of a Redeemer's name, and be marked out a par∣taker of that immense privilege? Before the founda∣tion of the hills were laid, the gracious design was formed, and the blessed plan of it schemed out before the curtains of the sky were spread.</P>
<P>Lord! what is man? what am I? what is all the human race, to be thus regarded? O narrow thoughts, and narrower words! here confess your defects; these are heights not to be reached by you. Adorable measures of infinite clemency! unsearchable riches of grace! with what astonishment do I survey you! I am swallowed and lost in the glorious immensity. All, hail, ye divine mysteries, ye glorious paths of the un∣searchable Deity! let me adore, though I can never express you.</P>
<P>Yet should I be silent, heaven and earth, nay hell itself, would reproach me: The damned themselves would call me ungrateful, should I fail to celebrate that grace whose loss they are for ever lamenting; a loss that leaves them for ever desperate and undone. It is this grace which tunes the harps of heaven, and yields them an immortal subject of harmony and praise. The spirits of just men made perfect fix their contemplations here; they adore the glorious myste∣ry, and, while they sing the wonders of redeeming love, they ascribe sublime and living honours to him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever. And infinitely worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive the grateful homage: Who shall not praise and mag∣nify thy name? Who shall deny the tribute of thy glory?</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="022860_0087_0FBA9F67D06D8D18"/>But alas! what can mortal man add to thee? what can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ingness and vanity give? We murmur from the dust, and attempt thy praise from the depths of misery; yet thou dost condescend to hear, and listen to our broken accents; amidst the <HI>hallelujahs</HI> of an∣gels, our groans ascend to thee, our complaints reach thee: From the height of thy happiness, and from the exaltations of eternal glory, thou hast a regard to man, poor, wretched man! thou receivest his hom∣age with delight; his praises mingle with the har∣mony of angels, nor interrupt the sacred concord. Those natives of heaven, those morning stars, sing to∣gether in their heavenly beatitudes, nor disdain to let the sons of earth and mortality join with them in ce∣lebrating the honours of Jesus, their Lord and ours: To him be every tongue devoted, and let every crea∣ture forever praise him. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>IMmortal spring of life, the fountain of all existence, the first and last, <HI>without beginning of days, or end of years</HI>; before the heavens were created thou wast, and shall remain unchanged while they wax old and decay. Thou art infinitely blessed in thyself, thy glory admits of no addition; the praises of angels cannot heighten thy happiness, nor the blasphemies of hell diminish it. Thou canst do every thing, and thy power finds no obstacle. <HI>Thou madest heaven and
<PB N="89" REF="022860_0088_0FBA9F6CE18ACEA8"/>
earth, the sea and the fountains of water; thou dost ac∣cording to thy will in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; thou holdest the waters in the hol∣low of thy hand, and measurest out the heavens with a span: Thou comprehendest the dust of the earth in a mea∣sure, and weighest the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance: Thou coverest thyself with light, as with a gar∣ment,</HI> and art surrounded with inaccessible splendor: <HI>Thou art glorious in holiness, fearful in praises; the hea∣vens are not clean in thy sight; but thou chargest thine an∣gels with folly: What then is man, that drinks in iniquity like water? What is man, that thou art mindful of him; or the son of man, that thou dost thus visit him?</HI> It is be∣cause thou art good, and thy mercy endureth for ever; mercy is thy prevailing attribute. Thou art compas∣sionate, and infinitely gracious, and hast fully mani∣fested thy love and beneficence to the race of man in the glorious methods of our redemption from everlast∣ing bondage and death by thy son Jesus.</P>
<P>Therefore with the lowest reverence, and most hum∣ble gratitude, I desire to prostrate myself before thee, acknowledging it my greatest honour, and undeserved privilege, to approach the Lord, and bow myself be∣fore the high God; I that am unworthy to utter thy tremendous name, or once to lift up my eyes to hea∣ven. To my own confusion, I here confess I have a∣bused the mercy which I now implore, and injured that goodness and forbearance by my sins which I am now addressing myself to. I have forfeited the very benefits I ask, and despise those sacred privileges which I am forced to plead: I can use scarce any motive
<PB N="90" REF="022860_0089_0FBA9DD6080567E0"/>
but what would carry in it my own condemnation. Shall I implore thy mercy by the gracious terms of the new covenant sealed by the blood of thy eternal Son! alas! that gracious covenant I have violated, and prophaned its sacred seals: I have sinned against the clearest light, and the tenderest instances of love: I have not only broken my obligations to thee as my Creator, but the stronger engagements of thy adop∣tion, even the glorious privilege of being admitted in∣to thy family, and numbered among the children of God.</P>
<P>But still those very circumstances that aggravate my guilt, exalt thy mercy; here the freeness and magnificence of thy grace will display itself; here thou wilt answer the indulgent title of a father in its tenderest extent; I have no sins too great for infinite clemency to pardon. Thou art God, and not man; and as the heavens are high above the earth, so high are thy ways of compassion above all human methods.</P>
<P>I dare not set bounds to thy goodness, nor affirm that <HI>thus far, and no farther,</HI> divine patience extends. Thou hast pardoned and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed me to thy favour too often for me now to despair: My penitent sighs were never rejected, nor my humble request unanswered: I have always found the heavens open, and the throne of God accessible, through the blood of a Redeemer. By his agony and bloody sweat, by his cross and pas∣sion, by his painful death and glorious resurrection, I implore thy pardon: He has made a full atonement, and divine justice will demand no further satisfaction. <HI>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his
<PB N="91" REF="022860_0090_0FBA9DD7655DA4B0"/>
name, whosoever believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins.</HI></P>
<P>O blessed <HI>Jesus</HI>! the hope of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the sal∣vation of the ends of the earth; the great <HI>Messiah,</HI> the promised Saviour, who dost answer those glorious titles in their utmost signification; to thee, my cer∣tain, my experienced refuge, I fly: O Son of God, hear me; O Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on me.</P>
<P>O eternal Spirit, the promised comforter, come with all thy sacred consolations! come, and be as dew to the drooping flowers, as rain to the parched ground; oh! come with thy reviving light, and dis∣pel the darkness that beclouds my soul: Break in like the sun after a melancholy night; one beam of thine would melt this frozen, this obdurate heart, and kindle in my soul the spark of holy love; breathe upon my cold affections, and raise them to a sacred flame.</P>
<P>Searcher of hearts, from whom nothing is conceal∣ed, whose penetrating eyes find out hypocrisy in its darkest disguise; thou knowest the desires of my soul, and art my impartial witness that I kneel not here for the riches and honours of the world; that I am not prostrate before thee for length of days or plea∣sure; but that it is the kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof, that I seek. Give me not my portion with the rich and great, but let me have my humble lot with thy children; let me bear contempt and derision, and suffer reproach with the people of God, rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="022860_0091_0FBA9DD914C8FBE0"/>Thy favour is the end of all my wishes, the con∣stant subject of my prayer. Oh! thou whose ears are open to the wants of all thy creatures, who hear∣est the young ravens when they cry from their nests to thee, who givest the men of the world the transi∣tory things they chuse, wilt thou deny the desires which thou thyself dost inspire and approve? O let me be filled with that righteousness which I hunger and thirst after, and be satisfied with thy likeness. Thou canst not be diminished, whatever perfection thou dost communicate to the creature; endless libe∣rality could not make thee poor.</P>
<P>I ask not privileges above the capacity of my na∣ture, nor aspire to the perfections of angels: I only beg that I may reach those heights of holiness and di∣vine love, which souls, invested with a mortal body like mine, and encumbered with the same human pas∣sions, have attained. But in vain I strive to imitate those bright examples thou hast set before me; with∣out thy assistance, all my endeavours will prove suc∣cessless. Thou knowest the frailty of my nature, and the mighty difficulties I have to encounter: I have not only the allurements of the world, but all the stratagems of hell to engage with, and a treache∣rous heart within, ready on all occasions to betray me into sin and endless perdition: O let my impotence and danger awaken thy compassion.</P>
<P>Remember thy former benignity, O Lord, and let that engage thee to grant me new supplies of that grace, by which alone I shall prove victorious. Thy bounty to any of the works of thy hands must always

I would urge nothing but thy own infinite mercy, when I entreat thee not to let me perish, after the wonderful things thou hast done for my soul; after all the pledges thou hast given me of thy love, let not my follies provoke thee to forsake me; but re∣member thy covenant, and its gracious articles, and act according to thy own ineffable benignity, which has been the glorious motive of every favour I have received from thee.</P>

<L>Why do I seek thee, if thou art not here?</L>
<L>Or find thee not, if thou art every where?</L>
<P>Tell me, O my God, and my all, tell me where thou art to be found; for there is the place of my rest. What imaginable good can supply thy absence?

<P>Adieu, adieu to all human things! Let me find my God, the end of all my wishes: Why dost thou

<L>Thy voice produc'd the seas and spheres,</L>
<L>Bid the waves roll, and planets shine;</L>
<L>But nothing like thyself appears,</L>
<L>Through all these various works of thine.</L>
<P>O thou fairer than all the works of thy hands, wilt thou ever hide thyself from a creature that loves and seeks thee with so intense desire? I appeal to thee, O Lord, are not my breathings after thee most hearty and unfeigned?

<L>For thee I pine, and am for thee undone:</L>

To follow thee I would leave them all behind; I would leave the whole creation, and bid the fields and sparkling skies adieu. Let the heavens and earth be no more, while thou endurest for ever, I can want no support. My being itself, with all its blessedness, depends entirely on thee.</P>
<P>Place me far from the bounds of all creation, remote from all existence but thy own; in that ineffable so∣litude let me be lost, let me expatiate there for ever, let me run the endless rounds of bliss;—but, alas; I flatter myself in vain with scenes of unattainable hap∣piness.

If thou hadst given me other capacities, and formed any thing more suitable to my wishes, I might have found a lower happiness, and been content with something below the infinite Deity; but the scanty creation affords nothing to satisfy me, and I follow thee by a divine instinct and mere neces∣sity of nature.</P>
<P>My life is useless, and my being insignificant with∣out thee: My reason has no proper employment; love, the noblest passion of my soul, has no object to answer its dignity. I am reduced to absolute pover∣ty; my nature is entirely ruined; I am lost, eternally lost, undone, and abandoned to despair, if I am depriv∣ed of thee. There can be no reparation made for an infinite loss; nothing can be instead of God to my soul.</P>
<P>I have willingly renounced all things else for thy sake: All the sentiments of tenderness and delight, that my soul ever feels for any earthly object, is mere
<PB N="102" REF="022860_0101_0FBA9DEBE77C42D8"/>
indifference, compared to my love for thee: and it grows into hatred when that object stands as thy ri∣val or competitor. This is the conquering, the su∣perior flame that draws in and swallows up all the other ardours of my nature. My engagements with all terrestrial things are broken; the names of father, of brother, or of friend, are no more: abstracted from thee, these tender titles give me neither confi∣dence, nor joy, and are mere insignificant names, but as thou dost give them an emphasis; they are nothing at all without thee; and with thee, what finite good can be an addition?</P>
<L>The soul can hold no more, for God is all,</L>
<L>He only equals its capacious grasp,</L>
<L>He only overfills to spaces infinite.</L>
<P>Thou art my God, and I have enough; my soul is satisfied, I am entirely at rest. Divide the vain, the perishing creation, to the miserable wretches that ask no other portion: let them, unenvied, possess the honours, and riches, and pleasures of the world; with a lavish hand divide them away: these things are but as the dust of the balance to the happy soul that knows what the light of thy countenance imports. After that there can be no relish left for the low de∣lights of mortality.</P>
<L>Lost in the high enjoyments of thy love,</L>
<L>What glorious mortal could my envy move?</L>
<P>You ineffable delectations of divine love, let me
<PB N="103" REF="022860_0102_0FBA9DED180F60C8"/>
have no sentiment of pleasure left but for you. My God revealing his glories and his graces in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> his Son, is sufficient for my eternal entertainment.</P>
<P>What if all former ideas of visible things were wip∣ed from my soul? what if I had no imagination, no memory, no traces left of any thing but the joys I have found in thy presence, and the assurance of thy everlasting favour? those are the only past moments I recal with pleasure, and oh! let all the vast eternity before me be spent in these satisfactions.</P>
<P>Vanish, ye terrestrial scenes! fly away, ye vain ob∣jects of sense! I resign all those poor and limited fa∣culties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which you are enjoyed; let me be insensi∣ble to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> impressions, if they do not lead me to my God. Let <HI>chaos</HI> come again, and the fair face of nature become an universal blank: Let her glowing beauties all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade away, and those divine characters she wears be effaced, I shall yet be happy; the God of nature, and the original of all beauty is my God.</P>
<P>What if the sun were extinguished in the skies, and all the eth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>al lamps had burnt out their golden flames, I shall dwell in light and immortal day, for my God will be ever with me. When the groves shall no more renew their verdure, nor the fields and vallies boast any longer their flowery pride; when all these lower heavens, and this earth, are mingled in universal ruin, and these material images of things are no more; I shall see new regions of beauty and pleasure for ever opening themselves in the divine essence with all their original glories.</P>
<P>But oh! how various, how boundless, how trans∣porting
<PB N="104" REF="022860_0103_0FBA9DEE94D7C508"/>
will the prospect be? oh! when shall I bid adieu to phantoms and delusions, and converse with eternal realities? When shall I drink at the fountain head of essential life and blessedness?</P>
<L>—and then,</L>
<Q><L>O what?—But ask not of the tongues of men,</L>
<L>For angels cannot tell.—Let it suffice,</L>
<L>Thyself, my soul, shall feel thy own full joys</L>
<L>And hold them fast for ever.</L></Q>
<P>Oh! break my fetters, for I must be gone. Bring my soul out of prison; I am straitened; the whole creation is too narrow for me; I sicken at this con∣finement, and groan and pant for liberty. How sweet are the thoughts of enlargement? My soul is already on the wing, and practises imaginary flights: I seem to reach the heaven of heavens, where God himself resides. It is good for me to be here.—</P>
<L>But ah! how soon the clouds of mortal sense</L>
<L>Arise, and veil the charming vision!</L>
<P>Alas! what do I here in this waste and dreadful wilderness? This dismal region, where our delights are vanishing, and the very glimpses of future felicity we enjoy are so soon overshaded, and surrounded with real horrors? Alas! what do I here, wasting that breath in sighs and endless complaints, that was given me to bless and praise the infinite Creator? Alas! what do I here, among strangers and enemies, in this wild, unhospitable place, far from my home, and all the objects of my solid delight?</P>
<L><PB N="105" REF="022860_0104_0FBA9DF00FB4A910"/>My wishes, hopes, my pleasures, and my love,</L>
<L>My thoughts, and noblest passions, are above.</L>
<P>What do I here, in the dominions of death and sin, in the precincts and range of the powers of darkness? Here they lay their toils, and set their fatal snares; but, Lord, what part have they in me? I have bid defiance to the powers of darkness, in thy strength, and renounced my share in the vanities of the world. I am a subject of another kingdom, and dare not en∣ter into any terms of peace and amity with the irre∣concileable adversaries of God and my soul, which in∣habit these treacherous and sinful regions. <HI>The friendship of the world is enmity with God.</HI> Death and destruction are in its smiles; I stand on my guard, and am every moment in danger of surprize: Oh! when will my deliverance come from on high?</P>
<L>—When, my soul,</L>
<L>O when shall thy release from cumb'rous flesh</L>
<L>Pass the great seal of heaven? What happy hour</L>
<L>Shall give thy thoughts a loose, to soar and trace</L>
<L>The intellectual world?</L>
<P>What glorious scenes shall open, when once this mortal partition falls, when these walls of clay shall totter and sink down into dust? Ye waters of life, ye torrents of immortal pleasure, how impetuously will you then roll in upon me, and swell and fill up all the capacities of joy in my nature? Every faculty shall then be filled, and every wish shall end in unutterable fruition. <HI>When I awake</HI> into immortal light, <HI>I shall

be satisfied with thy likeness.</HI> These expressless desires will die into everlasting raptures: Hope and languish∣ing expectation will be no more; but present, com∣plete, and unbounded satisfactions will surround me. My God, my God himself, shall be my infinite, my unutterable joy: All the avenues of pleasure shall be open before me, the scenes of beauty, and prospects of delight. <HI>Everlasting joy shall be upon my head, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away for ever.</HI></P>
<P>There will be no more intervals of grief and sin; sin, that insupportable evil, that worst, that heaviest burden: Here the painful and deadly pressure lies: It is this that hangs as a weight on all my joys; but thanks be to my God, I can say, I sincerely detest and hate this vilest of slaveries, this cursed bondage of cor∣ruption; I long for the glorious liberty of the sons of God; I groan under this load of flesh, this burden of mortality, this body of death.</P>
<P>But grant, O Lord, I may with patience continue in well-doing, and at last obtain glory and immortali∣ty through my Redeemer's righteousness. <HI>Sanctify me through thy word of truth,</HI> remember this request of my glorious advocate.</P>

<HEAD>XXVIII. A Prayer for speedy Sanctification.</HEAD>
<P>O Lord God, great and holy, all-sufficient, and full of grace, if thou shouldst bid me form a wish, and take whatsoever in heaven or earth I had
<PB N="107" REF="022860_0106_0FBA9DF5357C2380"/>
to ask, it should not be the kingdoms of this world, nor the crowns of princes; no, nor should it be the wreaths of martyrs, nor the thrones of arch-angels: My first request is to be made holy; this is my high∣est concern. Rectify the disorders sin has made in my soul, and renew thy image there; let me be satis∣fied with thy likeness. Thou hast compassed my paths with mercy in all other respects, and I am dis∣contented with nothing but my own heart; because it is so unlike the image of thy holiness, and so unfit for thy immediate presence.</P>
<P>Permit me to be importunate here, O blessed God, and grant the importunity of my wishes; let me be fa∣voured with a gracious and speedy answer, for I am dying while I am speaking: The very breath with which I am calling upon thee, is carrying away a part of my life: This tongue, that is now invoking thee, must shortly be silent in the grave: These knees, that are bent to pay thee homage, and these hands, that are now lifted to the most high God for mercy, must shortly be mouldering to their original dust: These eyes will soon be closed in death, which are now look∣ing up to thy throne for a blessing. Oh! prevent the flying hours with thy mercy, and let thy favour outstrip the hasty moments.</P>
<P>Thou art unchanged, while rolling ages pass along; but I am decaying, with every breath I draw: My whole allotted time to prepare for heaven is but a point, compared with thy infinite duration. The shortness and vanity of my present being, and the im∣portance of my eternal concerns, join together to de∣mand
<PB N="108" REF="022860_0107_0FBA9DF60FD982A8"/>
my utmost solicitude, and give wings to my warmest wishes. Before I can utter all my present desires, the hasty opportunity perhaps is gone, the golden minute vanished, and the season of mercy has taken its everlasting flight.</P>
<P>Oh! God of ages, hear me speedily, and grant my request while I am yet speaking; my frail existence will admit of no delay; answer me according to the shortness of my duration, and the exigence of my cir∣cumstances. My business, of high importance as it is, yet is limited to the present NOW, the passing mo∣ment, for all the powers on earth cannot promise me the next.</P>
<P>Let not my pressing importunity, therefore, offend thee; my happiness, my everlasting happiness, my whole being is concerned in my success: As much as the enjoyment of God himself is worth, is at stake.</P>
<P>Thou knowest, O Lord, what qualifications will fit me to behold thee; thou knowest in what I am defective; thou canst prepare my soul in an instant, to enter into thy holy habitation: I breathe now, but the next moment may be death; let not that fatal moment come before I am prepared. The same cre∣ating voice the said, <HI>Let there be light,</HI> and there was light, can in the same manner purify and adorn my soul, and make me fit for thy own presence; and my soul longs to be thus purified and adorned. O Lord, delay not, for every moment's interval is a loss to me, and may be a loss unspeakable and unrepairable. Thy delay cannot be the least advantage to thee; thy power and thy clemency are as full this present in∣stant
<PB N="109" REF="022860_0108_0FBA9DF7944A6D70"/>
as they will be the next, and my time as fleeting, and my wants as pressing.</P>
<P>Remember, O eternal God, my lost time is for ever lost, and my wasted hours will never return, my neg∣lected opportunities can never be recalled; to me they are gone for ever, and cannot be improved; but thou canst change my sinful soul into holiness, by a word, and set me now in the way to everlasting im∣provement.</P>
<P>O let not the spirit of God restrain itself, but bless me according to the fulness of thy own being, ac∣cording to the riches of thy grace in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> ac∣cording to thy infinite, unconceivable love, manifested in that glorious gift of thy beloved Son, wherein the fulness of the Godhead was contained: It is through his merit and mediation I humbly wait for all the unbounded blessings I want or ask for.</P>

<P>But how shall I express my gratitude for that grace

which ordained my lot in this happy land, one of the islands of which it was long since prophesied, <HI>they should see thy glory, and trust in thy name? God has en∣larged</HI> Japhet, even the islands of the sea, <HI>and made him to dwell in the tents of Shem,</HI> in the inheritance of <HI>A∣braham.</HI> I have my descent from the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who were once <HI>strangers to the covenant of grace, aliens from the commonwealth of</HI> Israel; but are now brought nigh by the blood of sprinkling. <HI>Jesus,</HI> the great peace∣maker, hath brought both near to God, and to each other.</P>
<P>I bless thee with all my powers, for the privilege of my descent from pious ancestors; that thou hast been their dwelling-place from generation to genera∣tion, and hast not <HI>taken thy loving kindness from their seed, nor suffered thy faithfulness to fail.</HI></P>
<P>Thou hast extended thy mercy to me, the last and least of all my father's house, unworthy to wipe the feet of the meanest of the servants of my Lord; and yet by an absolute act of goodness I am brought into thy family, and numbered with the children of God. Even so it has seemed good in thy sight, who <HI>art gra∣cious to whom thou wilt be gracious.</HI></P>
<P>I might have been a vessel of wrath, a trophy to thy justice, instead of a monument of thy mercy: How unsearchable thy ways! how uncontrouled and free! thou didst regard me in my low estate, in more than my original guilt and misery; for I had improved the wretched stock, and been a voluntary as well as a natural slave to sin and death.</P>
<P>From this ignominious slavery, thou, my great Re∣deemer,
<PB N="111" REF="022860_0110_0FBA9DFC63F287A8"/>
hast ransomed me, and brought me into the glorious liberty of the sons of God: I was a stranger, and thou didst take me in; naked, and thou hast clothed me with the spotless robes of thy own righte∣ousness; I was hungry, and thou didst feed me; thirsty, and thou didst give me to drink of the foun∣tain of life.</P>
<P>What am I, O Lord, and what is my father's house, that thou hast dealt thus graciously with me, in en∣tering into an everlasting covenant, signed and sealed, even sensibly sealed to my soul by the witness of thy spirit? Lord, why me, rather than many that were companions of my earthly vanities and folly? Whence were the motives drawn but from thy sovereign plea∣sure? How many are passed by, that could have done thee more service, and returned a warmer acknow∣ledgment to thy distinguishing bounty?</P>
<P>Ye spirits of just men made perfect, ye ransomed nations, triumphant above, instruct me in the art of celestial eloquence; tell me in what strains of sacred harmony you express your gratitude for this glorious redemption, while in exalted raptures you sing <HI>to him that loved and washed you in his own blood, and made you kings and priests to God.</HI></P>

<P>O my God, forgive my importunity: Thou hast commanded me to love thee with all my heart, my soul, my strength, and hast by thy spirit kindled the sacred flame in my breast: From this rises my present impatience; from hence the ardour of my de∣sires spring. Can I love thee, and be satisfied at this distance from thee? Can I love thee, and not long to behold thee in perfect excellence and beauty? Is it a crime to press forward to the end for which I was created? All my wishes and my hopes of happiness terminate in thee.</P>
<P>Does not the thirsty traveller pine for some refresh∣ing stream? Would not the weary be at rest, or the wretched captive be free? And shall not my thirsty, weary, captive soul, long for refreshment, liberty and rest? I am but a stranger, a pilgrim here, and have no abiding place; this is not my rest, my home; and yet if thou hast any employment for me, though the meanest office in thy family, I will not repine at my stay.</P>
<P>But, O Lord, thou hast no need of such worthless service as I can pay thee; thy angels are spirits, thy

<P>I can speak of thy loving kindness to the children of men in a very imperfect manner; but then I will join with the celestial choir, in praising thee, and re∣hearse to listening angels what thou hast done for my soul. Here I have a thousand interruptions from the delightful work, a thousand cold and darksome intervals, when my heart and tongue are both un∣tuned, a thousand necessary distractions, that rise from the miseries of mortality; but when these intervals of grief and sin shall cease, my soul shall dwell at ease, and be for ever glad, and rejoice in thy salvation.</P>

I humbly hope I have a rightful claim; thou art my God, and the God of my religious ancestors, the God of my mother, the God of my pious father: Dying and breathing out his soul, he gave me to thy care, he put me into thy gracious arms, and delivered me up to thy protection.

Shall I trust impotent man, that has neither wisdom nor might to accomplish his designs, that cannot call the next breath or motion his own, nor promise himself a moment in all futurity? Can I rest on these feeble props; and yet tremble and des∣pond when I have the veracity of the eternal God to secure and support me?</P>
<P>I know he will not break his covenant, nor suffer his faithfulness to fail: I dare attest it in the face of earth and hell, I dare stake my all for time and eterni∣ty on this glorious truth; a truth which hell cannot blemish, nor all its malice contradict.</P>
<P>Exert yourselves, ye powers of darkness, bring in your evidence, collect your instances, begin from the first generation, since the world was peopled, and men began to call on the name of the Lord; when did they call in vain? When did the Holy One of Israel fail the expectation of the humble and contrite spirit? Point out in your blackest characters the dismal peri∣od, when the name of the Lord was no more a refuge to them that trusted in him? Let the annals of hell be produced, let them mark the dreadful day, and dis∣tinguish it with eternal triumphs.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="022860_0120_0FBA9E0EEC9F7258"/>In vain you search; for neither heaven, nor earth, nor hell, have ever been witness to the least deviation from truth or justice. The Almighty shines with un∣blemished glory, to the confusion of hell, and the con∣solation of those that put their trust in him.</P>
<P>On thy eternal truth and honour I entirely cast my∣self? if I am deceived, I am deceived: Angels and arch-angels are deluded too; they, like me, have no dependence beyond the divine veracity for their bless∣edness and immortality; they hang all their hopes on his goodness and immutability; if that fails, the ce∣lestial paradise vanishes, and all its glories are extinct; the golden palaces sink, and the seraphic thrones must totter and fall. Where are your crowns, ye spirits elect; where are your songs and your triumphs, if the truth of God can fail? A mere possibility of that would darken the fields of light, and turn the voice of melody into grief and lamentation.</P>
<P>What pangs would rise, even through all the re∣gions of blessedness, what diffidence and fear would shake the heart of every inhabitant, what agonies sur∣prize them all, could the word of the most high God be cancelled? The pillars of heaven might then trem∣ble, and the everlasting mountains bow, the celestial foundations might be moved from their place, and that noblest structure of the hands of God be chaos, and eternal emptiness.</P>
<P>But for ever <HI>just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints; blessed are all they that put their trust in thee;</HI> for thou art a certain refuge in the day of distress, and under the shadow of thy wings I will rejoice. <HI>My

<HEAD>XXXIV. Glory to <HI>GOD</HI> for Salvation by <HI>JESUS</HI> and his Blood.</HEAD>
<P>LET me give glory to God before I die, and take shame and confusion to myself. I ascribe my salvation to the free and absolute goodness of God. Not by the strength of reason or any natural inclina∣tion to virtue, but <HI>by the grace of God I am what I am.</HI> O my Redeemer, be the victory, be the glory thine. I expect eternal life and happiness from thee, not as a debt, but a free gift, a promised act of bounty. How poor would my expectations be, if I only looked to be rewarded according to those works which my own va∣nity, or the partiality of others, have called <HI>good,</HI> and which, if examined by the divine purity, would prove but specious sins? As such I renounce them: Pardon them, gracious Lord, and I ask no more; nor can I hope for that, but through the satisfaction which hath been made to divine justice for the sins of the world.</P>
<P>O Jesus, my Saviour, what harmony dwells in thy name! celestial joy, immortal life is in the sound.</P>

<P>O my propitious Saviour, where were my hopes but for thee; how desperate, how undone were my circumstances? I look on myself, in every view I can take, with horror and contempt. I was born in a state of misery and sin, and in my best estate am alto∣gether vanity. With the utmost advantages I can boast, I shrink back, I tremble to appear before un∣blemished Majesty. O thou, in whose name the Gen∣tiles trust, be my refuge in that awful hour. To thee I come, my only confidence and hope. Let the blood of sprinkling, let the seal of the covenant be on me. Cleanse me from my original stain, and my contracted impurity, and adorn me with the robes of thy righte∣ousness, by which alone I expect to stand justified be∣fore infinite justice and purity.</P>
<P>O enter not into judgment with me, for the best ac∣tions of my life cannot bear thy scrutiny; some se∣cret blemish has stained all my glory. My devotion to God has been mingled with levity and irreverence; my charity to man with pride and ostentation.

<HEAD>APRIL 30, 1735. XXXV. <HI>A Review of divine Mercy and Faithfulness.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I AM now setting to my seal that God is true, and leaving this as my last testimony to the divine ve∣racity. I can from numerous experiences assert his faithfulness, and witness to the certainly of his pro∣mises. <HI>The word of the Lord is tried, and he is a buck∣ler to all those that put their trust in him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O come, all you that fear the Lord, and I will tell you what he has done for my soul; I will ascribe righteous∣ness to my Maker,</HI> and leave my record for a people yet unborn; that the generation to come may rise up and praise him.</P>
<P>Into whatever distress his wise providence has brought me, I have called on the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears; I trusted in God, and he saved me. Oh! let my experience stand
<PB N="125" REF="022860_0124_0FBA9E16567392E8"/>
a witness to them that hope in his mercy; let it be to the Lord for a praise and a glory.</P>
<P>I know not where to begin the recital of thy nume∣rous favours. Thou hast hid me in the secret of thy pavilion, from the pride of man, and from the strife of tongues, when by a thousand follies I have merited reproach: Thou hast graciously protected me, when the vanity of my friends, or the malice of my ene∣mies, might have stained my reputation: Thou hast covered me with thy feathers, and under thy wings have I trusted: Thy truth has been my shield and my buckler; the thee I owe the blessing of a clear and unblemished name, and not my own conduct, nor the partiality of my friends.—Glory be to thee, O Lord.</P>
<P>Thou hast led me through a thousand labyrinths, and enlightened my darkness. When shades and per∣plexity surrounded me, my light has broke forth out of obscurity, and my darkness been turned into noon∣day. Thou hast been a guide and a father to me. When I knew not where to ask advice, thou hast given me unerring counsel: <HI>The secret of the Lord has been with</HI> me, and he <HI>has shewn me his covenant.</HI></P>
<P>In how many seen and unseen dangers hast thou delivered me? How narrow my gratitude? How wide thy mercy? How innumerable are thy thoughts of love? How infinite the instances of thy goodness? How high above the ways and thoughts of man?</P>
<P>How often hast thou supplied my wants, and by thy bounty confounded my unbelief? Thy benefits have surprized and justly reproached my diffidence;
<PB N="126" REF="022860_0125_0FBA9E17D1924E68"/>
my faith has often failed, but thy goodness has never failed. The world and all its flatteries have failed, my own heart and hopes have failed, but thy mercy endures for ever, thy faithfulness has never failed.</P>
<P>The strength of <HI>Israel</HI> has never deceived me, nor made me ashamed of my confidence. Thou hast never been as a deceitful brook, or as waters that fail, to my soul.</P>
<P>In loving kindness, in truth, and in very faithful∣ness, thou hast afflicted me: Oh! how unwillingly hast thou seemed to grieve me? With how much in∣dulgence has the punishment been mixed? Love has appeared through the disguise of every frown: Its beams have glimmered through the darkest night; by every affliction thou hast been still drawing me nearer to thyself, and removing my carnal props, that I may lean with more assurance on the eternal rock.</P>
<P>Thy love has been my leading glory from the first intricate steps of life: The first undesigning paths I trod were marked and guarded by the vigilance of thy love: Oh! whither else had my sin and folly led me?</P>
<P>How often have I tried and experienced thy cle∣mency, and found an immediate answer to my prayers? Thou hast often literally fulfilled thy word: I have a fresh instance of thy faithfulness again: Thou hast made me triumph in thy goodness, and given a new testimony to the veracity of thy promises.</P>
<P>And after all, what ingratitude, what insensibility reigns in my heart! Oh! cancel it by the blood of the covenant: Root out this monstrous infidelity that still returns after the fullest evidence of thy truth.
<PB N="127" REF="022860_0126_0FBA9E1B43CECAE0"/>
Thou hast graciously condescended to answer me in my own time and way, and yet I am again doubting thy faithfulness and care. <HI>Lord,</HI> pity me, <HI>I believe, O help my unbelief.</HI> Go on to succour, go on to par∣don, and at last conquer my diffidence. Let me hope against hope, and in the greatest perplexity give glory to God, by believing what my own experience has so often found—<HI>That the strength of</HI> Israel <HI>will not lie; nor is he as man, that he should repent.</HI></P>
<P>While I have memory and thought, let his good∣ness dwell on my soul. Let me not forget the depth of my distress, the anguish and importunity of my vows: When every human help failed, and all was darkness and perplexity, then God was all my stay. Then I knew no name but his, and he alone knew my soul in adversity. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.</P>
<Q><L>Long as I live I'll bless thy name,</L>
<L>My King, and God of love;</L>
<L>My work and joy shall be the same</L>
<L>In the bright worlds above.</L></Q>
<P>I have yet a thousand, and ten thousand deliver∣ances to recount, ten thousand unasked-for mercies to recal: No moment of my life has been destitute of thy care, no accident has found me unguarded by thy watchful eye, or neglected by thy providence. Thou hast been often found, unsought by my ungrateful heart, and thy favours have surprized me with great and unexpected advantages: Thou hast compelled me
<PB N="128" REF="022860_0127_0FBA9E1D1F519FB8"/>
to receive the blessings my foolish humour despised, and my corrupt will would fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have rejected: Thou hast stopped thy ears to the desires which would have ruined and undone me, when I might justly have been left to my own choice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the punishment of my many sins and follies. How great my guilt! how infinite thy mercy!</P>
<P>Hitherto God ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> helped, and here I set up a me∣morial to that goodness, which has never abandoned me to the malice and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>atagems of my infernal foes, nor left me a prey to human craft or violence. The glory of his providence has often surprized me, when groping in thick darkness. With a potent voice he has said, <HI>Let there be light, and there was light.</HI> He has made his goodness pass before me, and loudly proclaimed his name, <HI>the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious.</HI> To him be glory for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>LET me go on, O Most Holy, to record thy faithfulness and truth; let it be engraven in the rock for ever; let it be impressed on my soul, and impossible to be effaced.—What artifice of hell is it that so often tempts me to distrust thee, and joins with my native depravity to question thy truth.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>Oh! may I never forget this remarkable preserva∣tion: Thy gentle hand supported me, and underneath were the everlasting arms. <HI>Thou hast kept all my bones, not one of them is broken:</HI> Thy mercy upheld me even when it foresaw my insensibility and ingratitude. How does my guilt heighten thy clemency? How wondrous is thy patience, O Lord, and thy rich grace, that only gently rebuked me when thou mightest have taken severe vengeance of my sins.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>I must again begin the rehearsal of thy love. Thou hast eased my pain, scattered my fears, and lengthen∣ed out my days; Oh! may my being be devoted to thee; let it be for some remarkable service that I am restored to health again.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>I find thy mercies renewed with my fleeting days, and to rehearse them shall be my glad employment. I trusted thee with my little affairs, and thou hast con∣descended to give me success. Lord, what is man, that thou dost thus graciously regard him? Even my

sins, my hourly provocations, cannot put a check to the course of thy beneficence; it keeps on its conquer∣ing way against all the opposition of my ingratitude and unbelief; and hast thou not promised, O Lord, it shall run parallel with my life, and measure out my days?</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>Jesus, my never-failing trust, I called on thy name, and thou hast fully answered my hopes: Let thy praises dwell on my tongue, let me breathe thy name to the last spark of life. Thou hast scattered my fears, and been gracious beyond all my hopes: My faint and doubting prayers have not been rejected; but oh! how slow are my returns of praise, how backward my acknowledgements!</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>Never have I trusted thee in vain; Lord, increase my faith; confirm it by a continued series of thy bounty: Add this favour to the rest; for faith is the gift of God, an attainment above reason or nature. I am now waiting for the accomplishment of a promise! Oh! shew me thy mercy and truth; add this one in∣stance to the rest, and for ever silence the suggestions of hell, and my own infidelity.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>How rooted is this cursed principle of unbelief, that can yet distrust thee after so many recorded in∣stances of thy love? How long will it be ere my wa∣vering soul shall entirely confide in thy salvation? Oh! my God, pity my weakness, give new vigour to my faith, and let me take up my rest in thee for ever.</P>
