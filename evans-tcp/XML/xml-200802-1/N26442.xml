<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the latter part of April last, I called on the Mayor of this city, and communicated to him a circumstance which I believed to be a very interesting one to the future health of the inhabitants of White-Hall and its environs, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That in filling up the wharf at the east side of the slip, they had already buried two dead horses, and at that period they were covering a third. Besides this, there were several hundred loads of street-dung, spread on the unfinished wharf: and that the place was in such a state of nuis∣ance, that it eminently threatened the safety of the inhabitants. The Mayor replied, That he would have the necessary enquiries made. On the same day, I made a similar communication to Alderman Fur∣man, and expressed a wish, that the Act for prevent∣ing nuisances should be attended to.</P>
<P>THE fact is, Sir, that part of White-Hall to the east of the slip, is in a most offensive condition.</P>
<P>THE crew of the ship Antoniette, from Copenha∣gen, which lies adjoining the nuisance above alluded to, and who cannot come on shore, or return on board, without crossing over the above ground, has sickened successively almost to a man. They have been sent to Bellevue, recovered, and on their re∣turn, have sickened again. The day before yesterday a man was sent to the Hospital—yesterday another—and this day two more have sickened; and I have no doubt
<PB N="6" REF="035161_0004_1000B015DE2698F0"/>
but their complaints are in consequence of exhala∣tions, arising from the wharf.</P>
<P>THERE are a number of people sickening in the neighbourhood of White-Hall, and the alarm it has created, is too well founded. Nothing short of the removal of a quantity of street manure, and other offensive matter, which now lies on the wharf, and the wharf being covered over with clean graver, earth or sand, intermixed with a quantity of lime, can possibly prevent the calamity which has already taken place, from extending its influence.</P>

<P>A REPORT prevails in the country, that the same Fever which proved fatal to so many of the inhabitants of New-York the last fall, has again made its appearance, and that the city, in consequence of it, has become very sickly. The disagreeable im∣pression excited in the minds of the people by such a rumour, is, perhaps, increased by several para∣graphs to the same purpose, which I am informed have appeared in the Philadelphia papers. In order, therefore, that I may be, in some measure, enabled to silence the fears of my friends, and to afford them the most satisfactory information upon a subject so important, I shall esteem it a favor if you will com∣municate
<PB N="7" REF="035161_0005_1000C2BE8F125278"/>
to me a candid statement of the business; for I have no doubt, that unless the most conclusive means are soon adopted by some medical character of influence among you, the alarm, however unfounded, will obtain such credit, as to prevent the people in the Country from resorting in their usual numbers to the City.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is true that a Fever resembling the one which proved so great a scourge to our city last year, made its appearance again about White-Hall, and in the vicinity of the Exchange, about the mid∣dle of July; but I have solid reasons for believing that this complaint will not be extended beyond cer∣tain limits. You may recollect, that in the frequent conversations we have had together, on the subject of the last year's Fever, I have been uniform in my opi∣nion as to the cause of its production, namely<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This sentiment <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the notice of the ingenious Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who put the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> construct<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in New-York, was attributed, by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Physician<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>, <HI>the accumulation of every species of filth and perishable mat∣ter, on the low <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade grounds, on the south side of the city, and the abominable custom of filling up slips and docks with similar materials.</HI> I have said that thes;e causes, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by a moist atmosphere and hot sun, could not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of producing the most baneful exhala∣tions,
<PB N="8" REF="035161_0006_1000C2D1453BDFD0"/>
and that their effects must necessarily be felt by those who were more immediately exposed to their influence.</P>
<P>THE proprietors of the lots on the East side of White Hall slip, carried out a bulk head the last spring, with a view to extend the dock further into the river. The dimensions of the dock are very consi∣derable, and a maxim invariably adopted by the pro∣prietors of docks, is, that <HI>the cheapest mode of filling is the best.</HI> Accordingly, carts were employed to collect such dirt and filth as all large, populous cities furnish in abundance, and with those materials was the dock filled up; and to add to the <HI>salubrity</HI> of the mass, there was occasionally added, dead horses, dogs, cats, hogs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE exposure of White Hall, and indeed the whole of the West end of the city of New-York, must be considered as extremely healthy. The winds during the warm season, are generally from the Sea, and ar∣rive to this part of the town uncontaminated, by passing over unwholesome grounds. Yet such is the fact, that the poisonous exhalations which have abounded in that quarter during the warm weather, have so changed the air, that the inhabitants on the South side of Pearl-street, between Old-slip and White-Hall, almost all concur in their testimony, that the disagree∣able effluvia has frequently compelled them to close their windows, especially in the evening, on the South side of their houses; and, in several instances, have assured me, that the offensive smells have been such, as to occasion vomiting.</P>
<P>THE dock on which Mr. Delafield's stores are erected, is in a state truly execrable, and the slip on the right and on the left is little better. These, and such places, are visited by the Dock-Fever—the Yel∣low-Fever, if you please, that murderer of our own creating.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="035161_0007_1000B05555F2D1F8"/>
WERE the proprietors of these and such like docks, compelled to live on them, the evil would soon be re∣medied; but people of this description are generally secure from the ravages of disease, enjoying the bene∣fit of their rents in the cooler retirements of the country.</P>
<P>BUT, fortunately for us, from a concurrence of happy events, the dock-fever has entirely disappeared. It has continued for a short time only, when a gra∣cious Providence sent us hard winds, repeated thunder and lightning, inundations of rain, and cool weather. To causes of this kind are we to ascribe the suspension of a formidable disease, which had begun to shew it∣self among us.</P>
<P>THE present exertions of our Common Council, in giving a new surface of wholesome earth to the dock of White Hall, will, without doubt, contribute to the same salutary effects; and, if the same measures were extended to other parts of the town, there would be much less reason to apprehend a return of the Dock-Fever.</P>
<P>THUS, Sir, your questions are answered. You might have come to town with safety.—You <HI>may</HI> come to town with safety; but I would advise you and all your country brethren, not to reside or sleep in the neighbourhood of filthy docks. New-York, as I have said before, may be rendered as healthy a city as any under the sun; and when its baneful police is chang∣ed, and the nuisances with which the city abounds are corrected, you will hear no more of the ravages of par∣ticular diseases.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED a letter from you, da∣ted November 26, expressing a wish that I would fur∣nish the Commissioners of health, with such observa∣tions as had occurred to me during the last summer and autumn, relative to the causes or origin of the disease, which occasioned so much alarm in this city, and which proved fatal to so many of its inhabitants; and that these observations might be accompanied with such reflections as I might deem proper relative to
<PB N="11" REF="035161_0009_1000B0B6D331E120"/>
nuisances, for the removal of which a law was pass∣ed by the legislature of the state, on the first of April, 1796.</P>
<P>As it regards the first request, I had fortunately made some progress in stating the principal facts, at the period of receiving your letter, which I have since completed, and which marked No. 1, is sub∣mitted to the perusal of the Commissioners.</P>
<P>I SHALL endeavour to perform the task assigned me, by making such reflections on the subject of nuisances, as circumstances may have given rise to.</P>
<P>IN the summer and autumn of 1795, a disease pre∣vailed in this city, denominated from its nature and violence, the Yellow-Fever. The terror and dismay which it produced in all classes of Citizens, may be easily remembered; and the influence it had on the commerce of the city, and the number of lives it destroyed, are circumstances of too recent a date to be forgotten.</P>
<P>IN this distressing situation, application was made to the Medical Society of the state of New-York, to favour the Public with its opinion of the nature of that disease. The Society accordingly addressed a let∣ter to the Magistracy upon the subject, (a copy of which is enclosed) containing remarks, among others, upon such nuisances, as appeared at least, to aggra∣vate the then prevailing fever, and to render it more malignant and fatal; and to the influence of this letter, I presume we are to ascribe, principally, the act of the Legislature above alluded to, for the removal of these nuisances. Why a law of such magnitude has not been carried into complete effect, is a matter of surprize and regret among the citizens in general. A law was conceived to be necessary—every hand was raised for its enaction—and if, by the general expres∣sion,
<PB N="12" REF="035161_0010_1000B0BA97D3F5D8"/>
it was thought proper, it is much to be lament∣ed that we have not experienced its salutary operation. How far otherwise, indeed, has it been? The vast ac∣cumulation of perishable matter at White-Hall, after the passing of the law, affording effluvia of the most noxious kind, and which from the clearest evi∣dence, was the principal cause of the late sickness in that quarter, is a lamentable instance of inattention to what was so much the general wish!</P>
<P>THE law for the removal of nuisances, passed the 1st of April last, among many other things, respects, particularly, the manufactories of soap, candles, vel∣lum and starch. But, unfortunately, these very of∣fensive repositories remain exactly where they were; and the annoyance which the neigbouring inhabitants have experienced from them, has been a subject of re∣peated complaint. They have not only rendered the situations of many, extremely uncomfortable, but there is reason for apprehending worse consequences, which the letter of Mr. Coles, accompanying these remarks, pretty clearly evinces.</P>
<P>IT has been urged that the removal of the above nuisances, would be expensive to the citizens; but a consideration of this kind, is surely not to be put in competition with our lives. I trust there are few in∣deed who would not cheerfully contribute to the exe∣cution of the law, both in letter and spirit; and thus free a populous city of those causes of mortality, which are of a nature extremely active, and certain in their effect; and which, if suffered to remain, may bring thousands to their grave.</P>
<P>PERMIT me further to add, that the calamitous situ∣ation to which we have lately been twice reduced, ought to stimulate our endeavours, and excite us to vi∣gilance and care. Timely precaution may prevent a return of Yellow Fever in this city, or perhaps one of
<PB N="13" REF="035161_0011_1000B03179F4A3B0"/>
a more pestilential kind: or, failing in that, it may alleviate their violence, and restrain their devasta∣tions.</P>
<P>IT is true that diseases seldom become <HI>Epidemic,</HI> in∣dependent of a certain state of the air. We have ex∣perienced that state of the air and its effects, and we have no security against its returning even the ensuing season—And I cannot but believe that every good citizen will consider the inconveniencies to which he may be exposed, by the operation of the law upon the subject, as inseparable from the obligation and duty he owes to society; and he who willingly submits, may have this consolatory reflexion, that his acquies∣cence may have been the means of saving the lives of thousands, in guarding a populous city from the ex∣treme miseries and fatality attending pestilential dis∣eases.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude with observing, that if my re∣marks have extended beyond what was intended to be understood by your request; or, if I have ventured further than I ought to have done, I hope that my anxiety to preserve the reputation of the city, and to promote the welfare and comfort of my fellow-citizens, will plead my apology.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<P>BEFORE I undertake to account for the origin of the Fever, which made its appearance in this city in June last, I must be permitted to revert to certain facts and opinions contained in a work which I fur∣nished to the public on the subject of a similar Fever, which prevailed more generally in this city, during part of the Summer and Autumn of 1795.</P>
<P>IN that publication it was stated, that the Fever was first observed in the neighbourhood of Fitch's wharf, in Water-street, and that it gradually extended from thence, in different ways, but more particularly in the direction of the prevailing winds.</P>
<P>NEAR where the Fever first began, there were se∣veral unfinished docks, which had been receptacles, for several years, of every kind of filth and dirt.—There was also, a considerable surface of new made ground in the neighbourhood, in a very unfinished state, upon which, dirt collected from the streets, was frequently thrown: likewise, several storehouses, erected on piles: and, added to these, a neglected and filthy state of the wharves. This representation, as it regards the then condition of the docks in that part of the town, is confirmed by the letter of Mr. Fitch, an extract of which is given in the publication above alluded to, and which, as it is much to our purpose, I shall again introduce. His words are, "Although the docks in the vicinity of the store which I occupy, may be less offensive than in many other parts of the city, yet, many of them are in a very exceptionable situation. The ponding of water, by running a bulk head across an unfinished dock, and
<PB N="15" REF="035161_0013_1000B0BEB87C3868"/>
leaving the vacancy for several years to be filled up with every species of filth and perishable matter, is an object worthy the attention of the Police. The situ∣ation of the grounds between Water-street and Cherry street, is rendered very noxious, by Water-street be∣ing raised above a certain level, and thus preventing those grounds from being drained. The effect of such nuisances on the health of the inhabitants, in a crouded part of the city, cannot be imaginary."</P>
<P>THOSE who have perused that publication, will find a number of reasons assigned, why the inhabi∣tants of the south east part of the city, would be par∣ticularly liable to Fever during the hot months. This opinion was warranted, in the first place, from mat∣ter of fact, as the Bilious Fever had appeared in that quarter for several years successively; and, in the se∣cond place, as a matter of reasoning, from the rela∣tive situation and exposure of that part of the city.—But fortunately the south east part of the city has been more healthy this year, than for several years past; and the causes of Fever seem to have been transferred to a part of the town, hitherto reputed little liable to any particular sickness.</P>
<P>IN investigating the causes of this change, a recourse to facts only, will afford a sufficient explanation.—</P>
<P>FIRST. THE docks spoken of, in the south-eastern part of the city, which were in so loathsome a state, have been completed and generally covered with a sufficient quantity of good earth, gravel or sand. The grounds have been drained, or, where that was not practicable, the surface has been rendered uniform with clean earth. The vacancies under the stores which were built on piles, have been filled up in a proper manner, and the wharves have been kept free from rubbish and filth. In short, so much care and industry have been bestowed here, to remove the nuisances that so generally abounded, that, where a person was
<PB N="16" REF="035161_0014_1000B0360BCB0EE8"/>
before almost suffocated with intolerable stenches, one may now pass without experiencing the least offensive smell.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. LET us see what has happened at the south-west part of the town. Between the Whitehall and Exchange-slip, a new dock has been made, run∣ning on an average 60 feet into the river, extending 458 feet in front, and 9 feet in depth. If 9 square feet are calculated to be equal to a cart load, it will be found that 24,000 cart loads were necessary to fill up the dock, which were accumulating from July 1795 to July 1796. And what has been the nature of the materials em∣ployed for this purpose? It is difficult to answer the question, except in very general terms, namely, every thing subject to decay and corruption. One third of the substance of this dock may be computed to be lodged above the ordinary height of the tides—there∣fore 8000 loads of these perishable materials were ex∣posed to the action of the hot summer sun. In the month of April of this year, I had frequent occasion to visit White-hall:—The stench which already issued from the dock, was highly offensive; and on enquir∣ing, I found that the matter which had been employ∣ed to make the new ground, consisted chiefly of the dirt which had been accumulating in the streets during the winter season; and that, besides dogs, cats, hogs, &amp;c. there had been actually two horses buried in the rubbish, which had died in the spring, in a small hovel, erected on the margin of this nuisance.</P>
<P>REFLECTING on this state of things at White-hall, and recollecting what had happened in another part of the city under similar circumstances, I found my mind strongly impressed with the probable consequences;—and was led from thence to converse with several in∣dividuals of the corporation on the subject. But no∣thing material could be done to guard against the sup∣posed
<PB N="17" REF="035161_0015_1000C2C2950C6998"/>
probable mischiefs. There was a contract<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above declaration will be found explanatory of most of the evils which this city <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> experienced from that period to the present, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>—the interference of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> protracting from year to year, those necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which the welfare of this city <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> be∣tween the proprietors of the ground and other indi∣viduals, for filling in that dock, with which the magis∣tracy did not think themselves authorized to interfere, unless it was declared to be a nuisance on oath, or by presentment of the Grand Jury. About the middle of June, the offensive smells arising from the new dock and other nuisances in the neigbourhood, were very generally observed in that quarter of the city, and their effects were manifest in many who complained of head-achs, sick stomachs, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE situation of the Exchange slip, as a source of noxious exhalations I feel myself obliged to notice also particularly. This slip from its length and narrow∣ness—from its being the receptacle of an extensive common sewer;—and, especially from having a great proportion of its muddy bottom exposed at low water, sends forth effluvia, which, in a very sensible manner, contaminates the air to a considerable distance around.</P>
<P>IN a letter published in July last, I had occasion to mention the frequent disagreeable state of the air in the south-west part of the city. It was there stated, "that the poisonous exhalations which had abounded in that quarter during the warm weather, had rendered the air so noxious, that the inhabitants on the south-side of Pearl-street, between the Old-slip and White-hall, almost all concur in their testimony that the disagreea∣ble effluvia have frequently obliged them, especially in the evening, to close their windows on the south-side of their houses; and in several instances gentlemen have assured us, that the offensive smell has been such, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to occasion vomiting." These are circumstances of great moment and are entitled to serious considerati∣on,
<PB N="18" REF="035161_0016_1000C2C4193D0F40"/>
if they are regarded only as causes which increase the malignity of diseases.</P>
<P>IN the latter part of June, the fever began to shew itself about White-hall, and in the vicinity of the Ex∣change; but it continued for a short time only, when the concurrence of high winds, heavy rains, much thunder and lightening, and cool weather, which hap∣pened about the middle of July, were probably the causes to which we may attribute the suspension of the disease. This, at least, was rendered probable, be∣cause as soon as the weather became warm and dry again, it was accompanied by those noxious exhalati∣ons which again produce the fever. Thus the disease appeared, went off, and came on again, according as the weather favored or impeded the generation of those vapors, which, in their operation on the human body, are the exciting cause of fever.</P>
<P>I MUST take notice of some other circumstances re∣lative to many of the houses about White-hall, which, if they were not of themselves, in any instance a cause of Fever, must certainly be considered of a nature to aggravate the disease, when brought on by other causes—namely, the state of the ground in the rear of the houses, which, in consequence of the streets being rais∣ed, is, in many places considerably below the ordina∣ry level, and therefore liable to accumulate matters which render the air impure, and which, in confined situations, are often the cause of Fevers.—Also, the old and decayed state of many of the houses, and the inattention to cleanliness, which is always neglected, where people of the poorer sort are much crouded toge∣ther. The bedding and clothes of the sick under these circumstances, must be supposed to become more and more impregnated with the exhalations arising from their bodies; and hence the dreadful havock made by infectious diseases in the small houses of the poor, and on such as are destitute of the means of cleanliness,
<PB N="19" REF="035161_0017_1000B03AE40B2088"/>
and who, of necessity, are obliged to remain a length of time without changing their clothes.</P>
<P>THE further we enquire into the sources of the Fever, the greater is the analogy discovered to be, between the state of things at White Hall, and in that part of the city where the Fever first appeared last year. Accumulations of decaying animal and vegetable matters—a part of the ground below the general level—poor people crouded together in small uncleanly apartments, were circumstances so per∣fectly coincident, that were particular effects to take place in one situation, we should naturally expect simi∣lar effects to take place in the other. If the Fever of last year, and that of the present year, were brought on by the same causes, it may possibly be asked, how it happened, that in the one instance, it was so widely extended, and in the other confined to such narrow limits? This question admits of an easy solution. It is generally acknowledged, that Epidemic diseases are either produced or widely diffused, by some par∣ticular qualities of the atmosphere; and the extraor∣dinary prevalence of heat and moisture in the air, du∣ring the Summer and Autumn of last year, must still be recent in the memory of the inhabitants of this ci∣ty, while the state of the air, during the warm season of the present year, has been much cooler and drier than usual.</P>
<P>THUS, the Fever of the last year was more gene∣rally felt, because a peculiarity of the weather predis∣posed the body, or rendered it more susceptible of those causes which produced the disease: whereas, the weather of this year, occasioning no predisposition, the Fever was generally confined to a situation, where it required the exciting cause to be itself sufficiently concentrated to produce its effects.</P>
<P>MANY of the men who belonged to the market vessels which came to the white-Hall dock, sickened
<PB N="20" REF="035161_0018_1000C2C6D71B3110"/>
from being exposed to the exhalations arising in this situation. The boatmen of the Staten-Island and Elizabeth-town Ferry-boats, suffered very generally, although many of them were so cautious as not to sleep on shore, and to avoid all communication with the sick. Several of them died of the disease.</P>
<P>MANY transient persons from Staten-Island, who frequently visited at Mr. Cortelyou's, residing at White-Hall, during their stay in New-York, sicken∣ed, and some died. It was said that Mr. Cortelyou's family were sick with the Yellow-Fever, but this re∣port was not well founded. The family were not well during any part of the warm weather, but none of them had the Bilious Fever. Their complaints were such as are commonly the consequence of living in foul air, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>—sick stomachs and head-ach<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, attended with considerable lassitude.</P>
<P>THE above facts respecting transient persons taking the Fever, are confirmed by Dr. Clarke, of Elizabeth-town, New-Jersey, who, in a letter with which he has favoured me, observes, "There were many in∣stances of this disease among the ferrymen, who resid∣ed chi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of their time at White-Hall; and other per∣sons who slept there, sickened, and all had taken their passage from White Hall dock within twelve days of the attack."</P>
<P>IT is worthy of remark also, that the disease, ac∣cording to Dr. Clarke, occurred in those only, who had been in New-York.</P>
<P>HE writes that, "Amongst the cases which came within my practice, and from the best information of others, there was no instance of the disease taking place in any except <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who had been at New-York, and particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> White-Hall."</P>
<P>DR. CLARKE states further, "That there was no
<PB N="21" REF="035161_0019_1000B04291685C20"/>
instance of the Fever amongst the nurses, or attend∣ants upon the sick." This fact is confirmative of the opinion which we have always endeavoured to support that the Fever in question, is not a contagious disease. The operation of local causes in producing diseases, is well exemplified in the account of the Remitting and Intermitting Fevers of the West-Indies, given us by Dr. Hume:—"And while," says he, "The Hospital remained there (at Port Royal) the sick were seldom seized with complaints of this kind."</P>
<P>"WHEN another Hospital was built on the oppo∣site side, though only at the distance of four miles, not one man in a hundred, escaped these Fevers, who were sent to the Hospital and remained in it three or four weeks;—and even the marine guard, who were relieved once a fortnight or three weeks, fared no better."</P>
<P>Dr. HUME describes the situation of this Hospital, to be in the neighbourhood of stagnant water marshes. He then adds, "It was the damp winds filled with the putrid exhalations, which occasioned the frequen∣cy of remitting or Yellow-Fever, and intermitting dis∣orders of this place. At my request this hospital was deserted, although in all other respects it was good, and had cost near fifty thousand pounds sterling.—Several plantations near this hospital, were unhealthy from the same causes."</P>
<P>IT would be endless to quote authorities upon this subject, nor is it necessary to look to a distance for them. What has happened within our own state, abundantly confirms the fact, as may be seen from Dr. William's letter, inserted in my publication upon the Fever of last year. I do not think it necessary to be more particular in reciting facts, or in detailing those circumstances which, in my mind, are fully compe∣tent to explain the origin of the Fever which has ex∣cited so much alarm, and proved so great a scourge
<PB N="22" REF="035161_0020_1000C2C951947D00"/>
to the citizens of New-York. It is the less necessary, because I mean to shew, by the following documents, that the disease was not, as many have insinuated, nay positively declared, brought here from abroad: and if we can advance sufficient testimony to invalidate that opinion, the conclusion necessarily follows, that the Fever was occasioned by causes of a domestic na∣ture; and therefore, the fact we are solicitous to es∣tablish, receives that degree of probability, which, in matters of this kind, give an assurance, equal to de∣monstration.</P>
<P>I SHALL, then, in the next plaae, bring forward what appertains to the vessels supposed to have intro∣duced the Yellow-Fever into New-York.</P>
<P>THE first suspected vessel was the ship Antoniette.</P>
<P>ON the 25th of May, the ship Antoniette arrived in this harbor from Brest, in ballast, and anchored in the North-River. Two days after her arrival, I was requested to visit sick on board. The Command∣er of the vessel assured me that the men had not been confined, nor did he think their indisposition such as to render it necessary they should be sent to the Hospi∣tal. One of the men was then at work on deck, and the other came from below immediately on being call∣ed. As, however, the ship was to be brought to a dock, it was thought expedient that these men should be sent to the Hospital.</P>
<P>THAT they had not complaints of an infectious nature, shall not rest on my assertion alone. The opinion and declaration of Dr. M'Farlin, under whose care they were placed, will carry with them much stronger evidence.</P>

The one complained of a pain in his breast, attended with cough and difficulty of breathing. His strength was considerably impaired—the complaint, which he attributed to cold, having been of some duration. By the application of a blister to the sternum, and the con∣tinued use of expectorants, he was discharged as cured from the Hospital.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>On the 29th of May, the Antoniette hauled to the dock at White Hall. In this situation, the crew could not come on shore, nor return on board, without passing over the new made grounds; and thus were the men exposed to the exhalations which arose from it whilst in the ship, and occasionally, in a greater de∣gree, by their visits on shore. During the month of June, most of the men of the Antoniette, complained of an unusual weakness, and in the beginning of July, several of them were attacked with the Fever.</P>
<P>Two of these cases terminated in black vomit and death. The causes of the sickness on board the Antoi∣nette,
<PB N="24" REF="035161_0022_1000C2CEC7588DE0"/>
being no longer a subject of conjecture, the remedy became obvious—namely, the removal of the vessel to a more healthy situation; and as the ship had lain more than a month at White Hall dock, it must be supposed that the air beneath her decks had become completely saturated with the noxious vapours arising from that mass of decaying materials, of which the dock was composed.</P>
<P>IT was deemed necessary, therefore, to have recourse to the measures commonly employed to purify vessels. For this purpose, the Antoinette was hauled out into the stream; and after the process of purification was over, she was directed into the North river to take in her cargo. After this period, the men on board her remained in good health, except Captain Hendricks, who had the ague and fever.</P>
<P>Now, as the men who were complaining at the time of the arrival of the Antoniette, were not sick with fever (of which Dr. M'Farlin's letter is suffici∣ent evidene) and as the Fever did not appear among the crew, until five weeks after she had been at the White Hall dock, and more than ten days after it had appeared on shore, it must require a more than ordi∣nary share of pre-possession in any one, to believe that the Antoinette had any agency in the origin of the Fever at White Hall.</P>
<P>ON the 29th of July, the brig Patty arrived in this port. After her departure, a report was circulated, and by many credited, that she had introduced a Ma∣lignant Fever into this city. Although on this subject I had no doubt, as I had taken a manifest of the healthful situation of the brig Patty, and the crew had undergone my personal examination, yet I was anxious that every suspicion should, as far as possible, be removed from the minds of the citizens. I was therefore induced to write to the commander of the brig, who was then at Boston, to request he would
<PB N="25" REF="035161_0023_1000B047266F9598"/>
give me an attested statement of facts respecting such sickness as might have existed on board the brig dur∣ing the voyage, and the condition of the health of her crew at her arrival in this port—whether she had any Fever on board after that period, or whether any per∣son had sickened in Boston after her arrival there, who had had communication with her. To these enquiries I shortly after received the following attested certificate:—</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THIS is to certify, that during my voyage in the Brig Patty, from Boston to the West-Indies, and back to New-York, none of my crew were sick of a malignant Fever; and that at my arival in New-York, all my crew were in good health, except my Mate, who was sick with the Ague and Fever, and who was taken out of my vessel and put on board a Packet to be sent home to Trenton; and since my arrival in Boston, my crew has remained in perfect health as before;—nor has any person who has been on board the brig Patty, re∣ceived, or been apprehensive of any disorder whatever.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THE above statement of Captain Snow, is so clear and conclusive, that still to entertain any doubt, would imply a mind disposed to contemn truth, even under the serious garb of a sacred oath!</P>
<P>THUS, then, I have taken a cursory view of the circumstances relative to the origin of the Yellow-Fe∣ver. In reviewing the situation of that part of the city, we have found abundant reason for believing the Fever was produced by causes of a local nature, and originating there. The importance of this fact ren∣ders me extremely solicitous that the truth of it should be generally established, and strongly impressed on every mind: for, if measures are to be pursued, cal∣culated
<PB N="26" REF="035161_0024_1000B0252E25DBA8"/>
to prevent the calamity in future, the extent and adequacy of those measures, must depend on this conviction.</P>
<P>IT is to be hoped, that we may not deceive our∣selves, by a mode of reasoning adopted by some, which, however plausible it may appear at first view, must cer∣tainly prove fallacious on examination.</P>
<P>IT is urged, that the city of New-York has re∣mained, for many years, exempt from any particular∣ly fatal diseases; and we have no greater reason <HI>now,</HI> to suppose ourselves more liable to sickness, than for∣merly; and, that if diseases of a malignant kind, should, at any time, prevail among us, we ought to look to some foreign source for their origin. The answer to this argument is, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of things is every day changing. This city is extending its dimensions—the houses are becoming more compact and crouded together—the inhabitants are encreasing in number—and, more especially, the mode of making <HI>new ground,</HI> which renders a considerable part of the city a <HI>low level</HI>—are changes which place us in a situation different from that of any former period.</P>
<P>THIS kind of calculation, it is to be feared, is not by many entered into; but it is one which is entitled to serious consideration, inasmuch as it takes in those circumstances which have a particular influence upon the health of the inhabitants of the city of New-York.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I must take the liberty of men∣tioning to your Excellency, what has hitherto been the condition of the Hospital lately erected on Bed∣low's Island. I am induced to do this, in order that the inconveniencies under which it has labored, may be rendered apparent; and from a hope that measures will, in consequence, be taken to provide for the
<PB N="27" REF="035161_0025_1000C2D3CE7435E8"/>
Hospital in such a manner as may be necessary to com∣plete the establishment, and give it extensive utility.</P>
<P>THE necessary alterations and repairs which the buildings on Bedlow's Island required to render them sit to receive the sick, were not completed till the middle of August. As soon as these were done, ap∣plication was made to the Commissioners of Health, for a supply of necessaries to accommodate the sick—who, at this period, were sent to the Hospital from White-hall, and from several vessels just arrived from sea. The Commissioners directed the beds and bedding which had been used the year before at Bellevue, to be sent to the new Hospital on Bedlow's Island. Un∣fortunately, these articles were in a very filthy state; but as the sick were already at the Hospital, we had no alternative, but to select the cleanest of those arti∣cles and use them in that state. The Hospital was also unprovided with wearing apparel, than which, nothing is more necessary, as well for the comfort of the sick, as to prevent the introduction of infection into the Hospital.</P>
<P>UNDER these circumstances, the consequences were such as might naturally be expected; for, within eight days of the time in which these articles were brought to the Hospital, those people who had been employed in transporting the bedding from Bellevue, the nurses who attended the sick, and the steward of the house, were attacked with fever. The attending Physician, Monsieur Bouvier, was also indisposed for several days.</P>
<P>FROM this distressing situation, however, the Hos∣pital was soon happily relieved, by a supply of beds, bedding, and such clothes as were necessary for fre∣quent changes, and placing the sick in a state of the greatest cleanliness. From this period, neither nurse,
<PB N="28" REF="035161_0026_1000B04BB83C7818"/>
visitor, nor any kind of attendant, were known to be attacked with fever.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>The following is a copy of the Letter alluded to in the Letter addressed to the Commissioners of Health.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the MAGISTRACY of NEW-YORK.
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would be improper, at least foreign to the design of this address, to enter on the enquiry whether the late Epidemic which raged in this city, was imported, or generated among us. Our motive for addressing you at this time, arises from a desire to engage, and at the same time to assist, as far as we are able, your respectable Board, in applying a cor∣rective to some of those causes, which, we conceive, served at once to extend its influence, and increase its malignity.</P>
<P>ON this head then, we venture to point out the following objects, as particularly demanding the notice of the Magistrates, and the interposition of their au∣thority.</P>
<P>First, <HI>the accumulation of filth in the streets.</HI></P>
<P>THIS, being composed chiefly of dead animal and vegetable matter, is, when exposed to a hot sun, a source of noxious effluvia, which have a tendency to
<PB N="29" REF="035161_0027_1000C2D6A731A548"/>
produce the most fatal effects; and, that such efflu∣via have been the cause of Fever, has been confirm∣ed by repeated observation and experience in all parts of the world.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>Obstructed water-drains.</HI></P>
<P>THESE, by occasioning stagnant waters, and col∣lecting matter of various kinds, which, undergoing de-composition, emit air of qualities extremely pre∣judicial to health.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>The ground of certain parts of the city, where the lots of houses are considerably below the ordi∣nary level of the streets.</HI></P>
<P>IN such places, the necessary consequences must be an accumulation of various substances, which, under the influence of heat and moisture, putrify, and thus contaminate the atmosphere, and commu∣nicate properries to it, of a nature extremely delete∣rious.</P>
<P>Fourthly. <HI>The situation of many of the Docks and Stores along the East-River.</HI></P>
<P>IT is to be observed that in many places, large surfaces of mud are exposed at low water, which throw up during the heat of the summer, an intoler∣able stench; and this evil is greatly increased by a practice of filling in docks with every species of filth collected from the streets, which proves an unfailing source of unwholesome air. We remark, further, that a practice has been permitted in this city, which we conceive very reprehensible, and what, we have no doubt, has produced many instances of individual disease, if it has done nothing worse;—that is, the pernicious custom of collecting and throwing into one heap, great quantities of manure (gathered from the street) on vacant lots. This was the case (during the
<PB N="30" REF="035161_0028_1000C2D82FD96B90"/>
prevalence of the Fever) at the head of George-street.</P>
<P>To the causes above enumerated, some others might, with propriety, be added, as endangering, by their permission, the health of the citizens.—Among these last, are, Slaughter-Houses, Manufactories of Scap and Candles, Vellum, heather, Starch, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN laying this detail before you, we cannot con∣clude without declaring, that in our opinions, the malignity and fatality of the late Epidemic Fever, were greatly influenced by the before mention cau∣ses; and were it necessary, we could superadd the authorities of the first Physicians and Philosophers, as corroborative of our own.</P>
<P>WE, therefore, with confidence and respect, sub∣mit the above to your serious consideration; and hope that their importance, as affecting the health and re∣putation of the city, will receive, as undoubtedly they claim, your early and due attention.</P>

<SALUTE>May it please the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Commissioners of the Health-Office, having hitherto, as far as circumstances would admit, fulfilled the design of their appointment, conceive it proper, in the further discharge of their duty, now at the close of the year, to lay before the governor, an account of the manner in which they have executed their trust, of their expenditures therein, and, in ge∣neral, of the situation of the public establishment under their care; together with such observations as have occurred to them on the subject of preserving and promoting the health of the city, and rendering
<PB N="31" REF="035161_0029_1000C2DBDF488B80"/>
more efficacious the public provision for that purpose, and for the reception and accommodation of the sick.</P>
<P>THE Hospital at Bellevue, established by the Cor∣poration of the city, had remained, since the pre∣ceding year, furnished for the reception of the sick, and offered, in the beginning of the season, a com∣fortable asylum to those who might arrive from sea, until the establishment under the authority of the state could be got ready. It was accordingly begun to be occupied for this purpose, in the month of June, from which time, to the 18th of August, the num∣ber of sick sent thither, was chiefly from vessels arrived from sea. In the mean time, the buildings on Bedlow's Island, purchased of the French, being given up by them, were cleansed and made <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea∣day to answer the purposes of a Lazaretto, and were furnished with beds, bedding, clothing, medicines, &amp;c. and provided with a Physician, nurses, and other ne∣cessary attendants, and to which the sick at Bellevue, were removed about the 18th of August: And altho' from unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances, the accommodations there, were not so perfect as could have been desired, they were, by care and attention, rendered as comfortable and commodious as possible, and the place was visited by some of the Commission∣ers as often as occasion required. The number of sick thus received at the Lazaretto, from the 18th of August to the 1st of September, (the latest period at which any have been sent there) including those from Bellevue, was eighty-seven, of which seventeen have died: The greater part of this number had arrived from sea, and the remainder were inhabitants of the city, who could not find suitable accommodations at home.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners, at the recommendation of the Health-Officer, appointed to attend the sick as Phy∣sician, Doctor Bouvier, a gentleman who had acquired
<PB N="32" REF="035161_0030_1000B051B0BBFF78"/>
much reputation in a long residence and practice of Physic, in the French West-Indies, and who hath ful∣filled his duty with singular ability and attention, and with great success; and although the allowance made him of four dollars a day, during his attendance, is per∣haps more than their scanty funds would afford, it was, in their opinion, not adequate to his time and va∣luable services; and they therefore think it just that he should receive such additional pay, as may be judg∣ed to amount to a reasonable compensation, and accord∣ingly recommend him for that purpose.</P>
<P>THE Malignant Fever of the last summer and au∣tumn, though for a time very alarming, yet was hap∣pily, in a great measure, confined to a district of small extent, and greatly limited in its effects, compared with that of the preceding year. It prevailed in the White-Hall and Moore streets, and in Water and Front-streets and the South side of Pearl-street, from the Exchange downwards, and in the lower part of Broad-street.—The rest of the city was principally free from it, and in a healthy state; and the few persons who, in the other parts, were attacked with the Fever, could ge∣nerally trace the origin of it to that infected quarter, or to <HI>local circumstances,</HI> in their particular neighbour∣hood. It appeared in two or three instances in the month of June, but did not cause alarm till about the middle of July, from which time to 1st of November, the number attacked with it was about 247, of which there died 67; of this last number 7 or 8 died at Belle∣vue, or Bedlow's Island, and are included in the return of deaths from thence.</P>
<P>ON this occasion, attention was paid to the timely removal of such patients whose circumstances render∣ed it necessary for their better accommodation, and to every other point in which, in the opinion of the Com∣missioners, they could contribute to the comfort and safety of individuals; and as far as their powers ex∣tended,
<PB N="33" REF="035161_0031_1000C2DE6CC2E0A8"/>
to the restoring and preserving the health of the city.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners have found, that the facts stat∣ed in the representation of the <HI>Health-Officer,</HI> on the subject of this sickness, are just; and it appears to them with satisfactory clearness, that the filthy and corrupt state of some of the <HI>Docks and Slips</HI> in the neighbour∣hood of the Exchange and White-hall, was the cause of the sickness; and there is little reason to doubt, but that, if the state of the air in general, throughout the summer, had been favourable to the propagation of <HI>infection,</HI> it would have found, in various parts of the city, from <HI>filthy and noisome manufactories,</HI> neglected vacant lots covered with offensive matter, and dirty streets and lanes, an abundant supply of <HI>noxious efflu∣via</HI> to increase and spread its baneful influence; and that the city would, in all probability, have suffered perhaps a more general and destructive calamity, than in the preceding year.</P>
<P>THIS impure state of things was obvious to all; and it was hoped that our late severe experience would have stimulated to a complete reformation; and that aided by the law "to prevent the bringing in and spreading of infectious diseases," an effectual exertion would have been made to <HI>remove all nuisances,</HI> and place the city, in all respects, in a respectable and whole∣some state. But the warm season arrived, and no measures of this kind were taken. The Commission∣ers presented to the Corporation, a representation of the state of the city, recommending a mode of clean∣sing and keeping the streets, &amp;c. in good order, a copy of which was delivered to the Governor.</P>
<P>AFTER some time, several of the most offensive slips and docks were cleansed and filled up in a proper manner, and some new mode was adopted for clean∣sing the streets, which, however, proved but <HI>partially</HI> efficacious, being, in the opinion of the Commissioners,
<PB N="34" REF="035161_0032_1000C2E001D5BA00"/>
far short of that recommended by them. But none of the <HI>offensive manufactories</HI> were removed—they all still remain—several of them in the most populous parts of the city, and are most <HI>dangerous and disgraceful</HI> nui∣sances; one of which appears from an affidavit of <HI>John Collis,</HI> referred to in a letter from the Health Officer to the Commissioners, to have occasioned the <HI>sickness</HI> of a whole <HI>family,</HI> and the death of one of its members. The continuance of this unhappy state of things, not∣withstanding the aid of the law, and the representations on the subject, afford a <HI>gloomy prospect</HI> with regard to the future welfare of the city, especially as there is no hope of engaging the Corporation in vigorous and ef∣ficient measures for a complete reformation. The Commissioners are convinced that the principal mem∣bers of that body, think justly and independently on this subject, and have been zealous in their endeavours to effect a change, and that several others are disposed to co-operate with them in the salutary work; but a majority have not been found willing to engage in those measures, at the risk of offending many of their constituents, and the consequent loss of their places; for, however obvious to all intelligent and liberal minds, is the necessity of placing and preserving the city in the most cleanly and wholesome state, yet a con∣siderable number of the inhabitants are opposed to any new and extraordinary measures being taken for that purpose, from the contracted and erroneous conside∣rations of encreased expence, partial inconvenience, or innovation.</P>
<P>THE measures necessary to place and preserve this city in a cleanly and wholesome state, are not difficult to ascertain. They are—to fill up all the docks and slips with clean earth, gravel, or sand, in such a man∣ner as that the <HI>muddy bottoms shall not be left bare at low water;</HI> and also to complete the filling up with the same materials, all the remaining vacancies under the stores and about the wharves, and to prohibit the com∣mon dirt of the street, or any filthy or corruptive mat∣ter
<PB N="35" REF="035161_0033_1000B0538D0E0E68"/>
from being used for this purpose, or thrown into them; to remove all such matters from the vacant lots or yards, in and about the town; and where such are so situated as to receive the wash of the streets, or ad∣jacent grounds, or retain <HI>stagnant water,</HI> that they be filled up with good earth, &amp;c. that the water may run from them into the streets; to provide effectually for cleansing all the streets, lanes, wharves, &amp;c. at least twice a week, and carrying the dirt and rubbish imme∣diately to a spot from whence it will be taken away in boats, without any delay, and to prohibit its being thrown elsewhere, and also to prohibit any filthy or corruptive matter or rubbish, from being brought out of houses, cellars, or yards, into the streets &amp;c. except at the time the persons appear who are employed to take them away; to complete the paving of all the streets, lanes, &amp;c. and the entrances of the docks, wharves, and slips; to provide that all the <HI>water drains</HI> be kept clean and free from obstructions, that no wa∣ter may remain and <HI>stagnate</HI> in them; and, to remove out of <HI>town,</HI> all manufactories which have a tendency to <HI>infect the air with noxious effluvia.</HI> These measures, carried into full effect, with the necessary regulations to prevent the introduction of disease from abroad, would, undoubtedly, preserve the city in as great a degree of healthiness, as it enjoyed in former years.</P>
<P>AND for the attainment of this most desirable end, the Corporation appear to be vested with sufficient powers; but, unhappily, the capacity for accomplish∣ing such important good, is rendered abortive by the prevalence of an improper influence over the majority, as stated above.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners are aware that this representa∣tion is made in <HI>plain and strong terms;</HI> but as they are not only convinced of the truth of it, from their own observations, but also find themselves justified in it, from respectable authority, which cannot be doubted, they conceive that the importance of the subject re∣quires,
<PB N="36" REF="035161_0034_1000C2E379979B48"/>
that the evil should be fully understood, in or∣der that the remedy, if any can be found, should be applied with the greater readiness and effect.</P>

<P>AS correct an account as could be obtain∣ed of the number of people who sickened and died in the neighbourhood of White-Hall, in 1796, is annex∣ed for two particular reasons:—1st. To shew that the devastations committed by that formidable disease, were limited to a few acres of ground:—2dly. and what is of equal importance, is, to shew that its fatality was in a ratio to the vicinity of the nuisance. From these facts, I would suggest the following question, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>—If the Yellow Fever is to be considered as a contagious disease, is it not remarkable that it should have raged with a violence almost unequalled in so healthy an ex∣posure as the south-west part of our city, and that the other parts of the city enjoyed, at least, a usual degree of health? This question cannot possibly, in my apprehension, admit of but one solution, and I would alledge that the temperature and disposition of the air during the warm season of 1796, was not fa∣vourable to the propagation of the disease generally.—As far as the poisonous exhalations arising from 24000 cart loads street manure, exposed to the influence of a hot sun, were distinguished by their offensive smell, so far their effects were manifested by the appearance of the disease and no farther.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE deputation of the Common Council, consisting of Gabriel Furman, Jacob de la Montagnie, and Thomas Storm, Esqrs. have, with the Health-Officer, and Commissioners, inspected the situation of the streets, docks, wharves and slips, from White∣hall to New-market, on the east river. The various objects which, in their opinion, require the interposi∣tion and authority of the Common Council, will be the subject of a subsequent representation. At present the Commissioners (whose immediate duty it appears to be) beg leave to solicit your attention to such measures as may be best calculated to remedy the following exist∣ing evils, <ABBR>viz:</ABBR>—</P>
<P>NUISANCES of considerable magnitude are found on several vacant and open lots—particularly one next to the Circus in Broad-Way, and another at the corner of Broad-Way and Beaver-street. These we think ought to be inclosed to prevent a greater collecton of filth and dirt.</P>
<P>THE surface of the streets at the head of the Old-slip
<PB N="42" REF="035161_0040_1000C2EA4B636F90"/>
and Beckman-slip, want considerable raising with wholesome earth or gravel.</P>
<P>EXCHANGE-SLIP ought to be filled up so far as the Common Council have already determined:—Also Burling-slip on a range with the south side of Front-street, and the lot granted Messrs. Van Zandt and Car∣ter, on the west side of it. This, in its present situa∣tion, is likewise a receptacle for all kinds of offensive filth.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners observe with regret, that ade∣quate exertions are wanted to dig out White-hall, Co∣enties, Coffee-house, Fly-market, and Peck slips.—They beg leave, therefore, to name Mr. Thomas Ha∣zard, as a suitable person to assist in the superintend∣ance, and to press the execution of these important objects.</P>
<P>THE solicitude of the Commissioners to obviate the effects apprehended from delaying this business, will, they trust, be a sufficient apology for the present ad∣dress.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>With sentiments of respect and consideration, I am, SIR, Your most obedient servant, JOHN OOTHOUT, Chairman.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM requested to inclose you the remaining observations on the situation of the streets, &amp;c, alluded to in our letter of the 10th inst. The
<PB N="43" REF="035161_0041_1000B05E897766A0"/>
Commissioners, tho' desirous of brevity in their com∣munications, do not find themselves at liberty to a∣bridge the present lengthy details; as, in their opinion, every object is of more or less importance to the ge∣neral health of the city.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, &amp;c. JOHN OOTHOUT, Chairman.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="observations">
<HEAD>RESIDUE of the observations on the situation of the Streets, Slips, Docks, &amp;c. made by Gabriel Furman, Jacob de la Montagnie, and Thomas Storm, Esqrs. the Health Officer and Commissioners, on the 10th of April, 1797.</HEAD>
<P>WHITE-HALL is very much incumbered with tim∣ber, brick and other lumber, and generally very filthy. The dock, east-side of the slip, wants paving, the new-made part of which to Exchange-slip, is, at least, one foot lower than the outer end and sides. The yards back of the new-built houses on it, are still lower, exceedingly filthy, and must become very offensive in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hot weather, unless filled up with wholesome earth or gravel, which the Commissioners beg leave to re∣commend to the attention of the Common Council.</P>
<P>THE lower end of Moore-street wants paving, as also the dock on both sides of Exchange slip, being almost impossible in their present state, particularly on Mr. Delafield's side.</P>
<P>THE pavement east-side of Coenties slip, is in great disorder, and much broken up, which makes it ex∣ceedingly dangerous for foot passengers, particularly women and children passing by the loaded wood-carts.
<PB N="44" REF="035161_0042_1000C2ECA14F6B88"/>
The Commissioners, therefore, suggest the propriety of widening that dock four or five feet from the up∣per end to the south range of Front-street, by build∣ing a new tier of wood against the old dock, well an∣chored together, which will be a very moderate ex∣pence to the proprietor. Unless this be done, it can∣not be made safe, nor suitably commodious for accom∣modating the business constantly transacted there.</P>
<P>MR. ASTOR's, and the adjoining vacant water jots, east-side of Peter Schenk's store, Cruger's wharf, re∣quire filling up, or digging out, as, in their present state they are receptacles of filth, and of course, great nuisances. The walks of Front-street, between Coen∣ties and the Old-slip, are generally out of repair, and some lots totally unpaved. Cases of this nature are so numerous in Front as well as Water street, from the Old to the New slip, that it is almost impossible to mention each in detail. On this head, therefore, the Commissioners beg leave to suggest the propriety of an ordinance, embracing the walks and streets of the whole city, unless such does already exist; for, with∣out they are repaired, it will be almost impossible to keep them decent.</P>
<P>THE same general remark must suffice with regard to filling up all the lanes and alleys leading to the wharves on the east river, from Coenties slip to Kip and Laurence's alley, above the foot of Dover street.</P>
<P>THE west side of the dock, at the Old slip, requires paving, nd the east side both filling <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and paving. At present, <HI>that</HI> also is almost impossible. The yards, rear of Blaze Moore's and Nevin Wilson's stores, Front street, are sunken, filthy nuisances, and the buildings on them fronting the river, tho' small, are considera∣bly on the street.</P>
<P>HERE, the Commissioners beg leave to particular∣ize a few more of the most important nuisances of that
<PB N="45" REF="035161_0043_1000B061D6C81B88"/>
description, on the east river, which ought, at least, to be covered with wholesome earth or gravel.</P>
<P>UNDER the new wooden buildings of William By∣ron, at the Fly-market slip—the stores of John Jack∣son, and those on the estate of Leffert Lefferts, at the lower end of Fletcher street (which street requires rais∣ing and paving, being at present a perfect mud-hole). Also under the store lately occupied by Knox and Briggs, corner of Burling-slip, Front street, in which the yellow fever originated last sprnig. Under the store, west side of Peck slip, corporation property.—Also under the corner store, on the east side, and the rear of Thomas Burling's and John Thurman's lots.—Likewise, Saml. Ackerly's lot, and under John Dic∣kenson's house. The two last mentioned are already very offensive, and will soon become dangerous.</P>
<P>THE remaining sunken lots and yards throughout the town, particularly on the east side from White∣hall to Catharine slip, are so numerous, and thought such great sources of unhealthiness in the hot season, that the Commissioners are much at a loss what to say on the subject of filling them up, as such an under∣taking must prove very inconvenient to numbers of houses, and be attended with immense expence, which many of the occupants are at present but illy prepared to bear.</P>
<P>THE docks on both sides of the Coffee-house and Fly market slips, want paving. Front-street, from the east side of Burling slip to Peck slip, requires re∣gulating, filling up and paving: Almost the whole, in its present state, being a perfect nuisance. If this great object be effected, it will compel a number of proprie∣tors of lots and buildings in that quarter, to fill up; by which means many filthy and sunken places, will be so far covered, as not to produce evils in hot wea∣ther, which otherwise, in the opinion of the Com∣missioners, may result.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="035161_0044_1000C2EEEB7D58B8"/>
THE dock on the west and east side of Peck slip, re∣quires paving; and the wharves in front, on the east side regulating and filling up. Both sides of James' slip, want paving; also the lower end of Oliver street from Cherry street. Catharine slip wants some dig∣ging out; and the dock on the west side of it, as well as Catharine market, require paving.</P>
<P>MAGAZINE, Augustus, Little Ann and Barley streets require a regulation and great improvements. In the district of these streets, there are two large ponds of stagnant water, which, with the noxious factories may render them a source of disease in hot weather, and are therefore, objects that require timely attention.</P>
<P>THE lower ends of Rector and Carlisle streets lead∣ing from Greenwich street to the North river, want considerable raising, being at present sunken miry places, and impassible.</P>
<P>THE large square in front of the new Albany bason, and the dock on each side, require paving. Some pavement also is wanted at the foot of Cortland street; and the slip at the foot of Dey street, should be filled up.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Commissioners have requested me to deliver you the annexed list of lots, &amp;c. on the low grounds along the east river, and its vicinity, some of which are at present offensive, and great recepta∣cles

<P>"AS the low grounds on the East river, South of Pearl-street, have hitherto been very much the seat of disease, in summer, the Commissioners are resolved to pay particular attention to their cleanliness; and will, as soon as possible, submit to the considera∣tion of the Common Council, some regulations to pre∣vent so great an accumulation of dirt and filth in that part of the city. They think, that Mr. Hazard will be a suitable person, as well for this purpose, as to pre∣vent the landing and storing of damaged hides, coffee, and any other articles of that kind, in a perishable or dangerous condition, They propose, therefore, that his attention should be turned to these objects, imme∣diately after completing those in which he is at present engaged."</P>

<P>THE Commissioners in their letter of the
<PB N="49" REF="035161_0047_1000C2F424DBE5D8"/>
5th inst. requested, that as soon as Mr. Hazard had completed the objects he was then engaged in, of cleansing slips with the machine, he might be employed in the superintendance and care of cleansing and re∣moving the dirt and filth from the piers, docks, &amp;c. of the city, from White Hall to New-slip, on the East river. This is meant to be done agreeably to some ar∣rangement in contemplation, whereby the proprietors shall bear a proportion of the expence, with the pub∣lic, if possible. The Commissioners think it most advise∣able to discontinue taking any more dirt out of the docks for the present. If their opinion concurs with that of the Common Council, they beg that Mr. Hazard may be directed to take charge of the other object un∣der the immediate direction of the Commissioners, during the time this service may be judged necessary, and to receive his daily pay from them, which is un∣derstood to be twelve shillings.</P>
<P>IN addition to the places already represented in dis∣order, the following require the interposition of the board.</P>
<P>Peter Goelett's and John Delafield's side walks, each side of Exchange Slip, ought to be made without delay.</P>
<P>THE L. from the Old to the new Albany pier, at Coenties Slip, wants filling up with gravel or other solid materials.</P>
<P>THE front of Robert Watts's lots facing the River, East side of Fly-market Stairs, where the Ferry House stands, is in a state highly exceptionable, and re∣quires considerable raising to cast off the water.</P>
<P>THE Alley leading from Peck Slip, between Water and Pearl Streets, is in a state of great nuisance, and requires filling up, so as to cast the water into Peck Slip. The proprietors are Thomas Ellison, Samuel
<PB N="50" REF="035161_0048_1000B06C836DAB98"/>
Farmer, Benjamin Mott, William Minturn, and others.</P>
<P>James and Catherine slips are also in a state of great nuisance. The Commissioners, though averse to fil∣ling up slips: if even it were optional with them) from a knowledge of their public utility, are at a loss what else to advise in the present case, to remedy the evils that may arise from the condition of these two. They conceive, however, that James's slip, as far as it runs bare, and Catherine-slip, as far as the North side of Wa∣ter-street, ought to be filled up.</P>
<P>THE lower ends of Chamber and Murray-streets, on the North river, are in great disorder, and require re∣gulating and filling. The rear of Mr. Strachan's lot, and Mr. Rhinelander's adjoining it, on Washington-street; and the lower end of Robinson-street, from Greenwich-street to Washington-street, want filling.</P>
<P>THE pavement in Front-street, and the side walks from the Old slip to Gouverneur's alley, particularly, are in such disorder, that it is impossible to get them kept decent and wholesome without repairs. This leads the Commissioners to express their regret that so little attention has been paid to the streets and walks generally, where so much is wanted.</P>

<P>THE ship Shepherdess, commanded by Isaac Hand, arrived in this harbour yesterday.</P>
<P>MR. PARKER the person appointed by the Commis∣sioners to inspect all vessels arriving in this port from the southward of Cape May, in pursuane of his duty, hailed the Sheperdess on her way into port, and en∣quired the state of health of the crew. They re∣turned

for answer, that all was well. Determined, however, for certain reasons, to obtain more particu∣lar information, he boarded her, and made enquiries of the pilot, William Berwick, and of the mate, with respect to the health of the people, and was told there was no sick on board.</P>
<P>AT eleven o'clock this morning, I received a writ∣ten notification, that a man, supposed to be sick of the yellow fever, was lodged back of No. 30, Pope's alley, Rutgers' street. I repaired to the place, and found a Mr. William Moses, who had, the preced∣ing evening, been landed from the ship Shepher∣dess from Savannah. On examination I found him in the last stage of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>IN pursuance of the trust reposed in me, I went im∣mediately, and lodged the necessary information with the Alderman of the ward, Mr. Jotham Post, after which I proceeded to the ship, and requested the mas∣ter, Mr. Isaac Hand, to place colors in her shrouds, remove her from the dock immediately, and bring her to anchor on the ground assigned for quarantine.</P>
<P>ON enquiry, it appeared that William Berwick, a pilot, conducted the Shepherdess into port, and to the wharf. On being desired by the Captain to remove her into the stream, and to the quarantine ground, he equivocated, hesitated, and behaved otherwise impro∣perly.</P>
<P>AFTER having given directions as stated above, I lest the vessel with colors in her shrouds. Some time af∣ter, William Berwick, the pilot, damned the colors, took a knife from his pocket, and ordered them from the shrouds—a boy accordingly took them down.</P>

<P>WHEN the Commissioners of the Health Office entered on the discharge of the important trust reposed in them, they felt solicitous that nothing should be wanted on their part, to accomplish the objects of their appointment.</P>
<P>WITH this view, they have frequently been led to address you, on the subject of the numerous nuisances,
<PB N="60" REF="035161_0058_1000C306AF529BD8"/>
which existed in various parts of the city; and they acknowledge the readiness with which the Common Council have interposed their authority for the remo∣val of them. But, tho' much has been done, much more remains to be done. The object of the present address is, to call the attention of the board, to a sub∣ject which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, is of great moment to the future welfare of the citizens.</P>
<P>THE experience of the part summer and present au∣tumn as it regards the operation and effect of the <HI>sys∣tem of cleanliness</HI> introduced last spring, has convinced the Commissioners that it is practicable to a still greater extent. That it meets the general approbation of their fellow-citizens, is a pleasing fact: and, that our exemp∣tion from diseases incident to the season, ought, in some measure, to be attributed to it, is acknowledged. The few cases of yellow fever which have occured dur∣ing the past summer, were mostly on the borders of the east river, and originated in situations where <HI>nuisances continue to exist.</HI></P>
<P>WITH these impressions, the Commissioners beg leave to represent to the Common Council, the neces∣sity of directing by an ordinance, all the proprietors of water-lots, especially on the East river, to fill them up with solid materials, so that the whole extent of ground already granted, may be completely finished by the first of May next, at farthest.</P>
<P>OF whatever magnitude this proposal may at first sight appear, in its effects on the convenience or in∣terests of individuals, the benefits contemplated are incalculably great to the city in general: that is, the removal of those causes which may contribute to aid the return of pestilential diseases in the city.</P>
<P>DESIROUS as the Commissioners are, that the ex∣periment thus far successfully attempted, of obviating disease by cleanliness, may be more fully tried, and
<PB N="61" REF="035161_0059_1000C308725C5198"/>
convinced that the Common Council is disposed to concur, in the same important object they have only further to solicit their serious attention to this applica∣tion, which is made at so early a period, with a view to afford ample time for carrying the proprosed regula∣tion into complete effect.</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclosed report contains a particular account of the number of sick which have been sent to the Hospital on Bedlow's Island, from August the 25th, the period when I took charge of that institution, to the first of November, 1797.</P>
<P>AFTER having thus far acquitted myself on the score of obligation, my inclination prompts me to lay before your Board, some remarks on the nume∣rous inconveniencies which I have had to contend with during my residence on the island—inconveniencies which have not only rendered the situation of the sick, in many instances, very uncomfortable, but have also, greatly contributed to render the medical treat∣ment of them less certain.</P>
<P>IT was early in the spring discovered, that the buildings on the island, were very illy calculated for the accommodation of the sick. The few alterations and improvements which were made during the season, served the purpose of immediate exigency only, and were by no means calculated to defend the sick against the inclemencies of the weather, which necessarily
<PB N="62" REF="035161_0060_1000B07EC3A39C30"/>
take place at this season of the year—inconvenien∣cies with which they are at this moment contending.</P>
<P>ONE building only was intended for the reception of the sick, which in the course of the season, was found incapable of lodging the whole: and altho' another was fitted for the purpose, the want of sepa∣rate apartments, made it necessary to mix together, persons of all classes and descriptions, of different sex, and laboring under different diseases, and in all the various stages of their diseases.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more necessary in the treatment of the sick, than that the orders of the Physician should be faithfully performed, the better to enable him to ren∣der practicable the execution of his object. Yet such has been the state of things, from the mixed and various employments of the nurses, as to render it impossible in some instances, to carry into effect those measures which suggested themselves to me as necessa∣ry to promote the recovery of the sick.</P>
<P>As a counterbalance of the foregoing short unplea∣sant narrative, I shall proceed to make a few remarks of a more satisfactory nature.</P>
<P>THE liberal supply of linen, bedding, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which has been furnished for the use of this institution, has enabled the attendants to keep the sick in a state of compleat cleanliness. The result has been, that notwithstanding the many instances of Yellow-Fever, which have come under my care since my residence on this island, some of which possessing a degree of malignancy scarcely to be exceeded, there is no in∣stance in which the disease has been communicated to nurses, attendants or visitors, nor to the boatmen who have conducted the sick to the island.</P>
<P>IF from the want of opportunity hitherto, I had not made up my mind on the real character of the
<PB N="63" REF="035161_0061_1000C30C4ED56CA0"/>
Yellow-Fever, I should now have no more hesitation in attending the sick laboring under this disease, than in other entrances of Fever, without fear of receiving infection, provided due cleanliness and ventilation were observed.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Health Office, <DATE>Dec. 1, 1797.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE correspondence which I had the honor of holding with your Excellency, has been on a subject which yields to none on the score of public utility.</P>
<P>THE patient attention and ready assistance, which you have always bestowed upon it, emboldens me to trouble you on the present occasion, and inclines me to believe, that the vouchers which have been lately submitted to your inspection, have, as well as others, extremely interesting to the citizens, received a share of your attention. Feeling myself in a situation of great responsibility as it relates to the health of the city, it appears to me that I cannot be too particular in de∣tails which fix the PUBLIC ATTENTION, by adducing facts calculated, at once, to detect error and establish truth.</P>
<P>THE first representation that was made by the Com∣missioners of the Health Office, to the Common Council of this city on the subject of nuisances, was in the latter part of March, 1797. It is to be observed, that these nuisances were found too numerous to be all removed in one season. The Common Council,
<PB N="64" REF="035161_0062_1000C30E30FE3C80"/>
therefore, issued their ordinances for the removal of those only which were conceived to be of the greatest magnitude. And while individuals were employed in fulfilling the orders of the Magistrates, the Commissi∣oners divided the city into districts, to each of which a superintendant, and a suitable number of scavengers were appointed, who engaged to see that their respec∣tive districts were swept and properly cleansed twice in each week. By means of these arrangements, the most salutary effects were produced, insomuch that it has since been a common remark, that the city, during the last summer, has generally been free from those disagreeable effluvia, which before, especially in particular situations, rendered the air almost unfit for respiration. To these regulations may fairly be as∣cribed in a great degree the universal health of the in∣habitants during the sickly season.</P>
<P>THE first communication that was made to the Com∣missioners on the appearance of malignant fever in this city, was by letter from Dr. Anderson, dated Sep∣tember the 6th. This letter was followed by others of a similar nature from different gentlemen of the facul∣ty. The measures which were in consequence pursu∣ed, were such as were judged best calculated for the recovery of the sick, and the safety of their attendants.</P>
<P>IF, on examination, the sick were found accom∣modated in such a manner, as to allow of due clean∣liness and good air, they were suffered to remain with their friends;—on the contrary, if they were in croud∣ed and confined habitations, where ventilation was impracticable, it was thought expedient to remove them from the city. Here it is worthy of remark, that the instances of malignant fever which occurred in different parts of the city, had their origin in the neighbourhood of a nuisance, which had been report∣ed to the Corporation early in the season.</P>
<P>ON the 23d of September, a letter was addressed
<PB N="65" REF="035161_0063_1000B0848FCD7C88"/>
to the Commissioners from Dr. Faugeres, representing that the people in George street were sickening. The Commissioners, in consequence, were led to inquire what were the probable causes of disease in that quar∣ter. On examination it was found that the houses in that part of the street where the fever prevailed, were composed of small apartments, with cellars eight and ten feet under ground. In these were crouded toge∣ther people of a description truly unfortunate, whose circumstances and manners exposed them to all the diseases incident to poverty and intemperance. To this unfailing source of the cause of malignant fever, was added the manufactory of a Skinner in the same street, the emptying of whose vats threw such a quantity of noxious vapours into the atmosphere, as proved a great annoyance to the whole neighbourhood. On the 20th of September there were eleven persons sick within sixty yards of each other, in George street, five of whom died in twenty-four hours after I had made my first visit, at the request of the Commissioners.—The measures which were adopted in this instance, were to bury the dead without any unnecessary delay—to cause the rooms of the sick to be thoroughly cleans∣ed, ventilated and white-washed, and the attention of cleansing and ventilating was also paid to the bedding and clothes of the deceased. Lime was also furnished for the use of the indigent in the neighbourhood, whose families had not suffered from disease. By these means your Excellency may be assured, that the result was gratifying to the finest feelings of humanity. In the course of a few days, the people of George street were delivered from a calamity which threatened soon to be∣come extensive, and were restored to as healthy a state as usual.</P>
<P>IN the course of the season it happened that several persons were seized with fever, who had but a short time previous, arrived from Philadelphia. The con∣duct of the Commissioners was on these occasions si∣milar to that which they observed with respect to our
<PB N="66" REF="035161_0064_1000C3111B64E0E0"/>
own citizens. If they found the sick so situated as to enjoy all the advantages of cleanliness and good air, they were left under the management of their respec∣tive friends and Physicians: if otherwise, they were removed from the city. Hence, in all human proba∣bility, it happened, that there was no instance of com∣municated infection. This was particularly remark∣able in the cases of Messrs. Suydam, Havens, Burch∣ill and others, with whom the intercourse of friends was never restrained; and though their diseases were distinctly marked, and of the most violent type, yet they were not communicated.</P>
<P>AFTER engaging your Excellency's attention to the occurrences which took place in the city, it will not, I hope, be deemed a trespass on your time, to request it for a moment to those which occurred on Bedlow's Island.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners having used every means with∣in their power, to guard the city against the spreading of malignant fever, turned their attention to the La∣zaretto, in order to ascertain to what degree of hazard those were exposed, who were employed in removing the sick from the city, and from the different vessels, to the Island. To this end, the number of men em∣ployed (during the season) was limited to 8. These men, though often obliged necessarily to and lift carry the sick, suffered not, in the smallest degree, from their occupation.</P>
<P>IN the Hospital, there were eleven persons employ∣ed as nurses, attendants, &amp;c. among all these, there was not one instance <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fever. Mr. Osborne, Sur∣geon to the garrison on Governor's Island, was pre∣vailed upon to attend the sick on Bedlow's island, for a certain period; and in a letter which he addressed to the Commissioners on his resigning his employment there, (which is transmitted for your Excellency's perusal) he gives a particular account of the state of
<PB N="67" REF="035161_0065_1000C31440352190"/>
the Hospital, and expresses much satisfaction at see∣ing the good effects which cleanliness and ventilation had afforded it.</P>
<P>IF there needed any other confirmation than what has occurred through the season, and happened with∣in the knowledge of the Commissioners, it may be found in the following facts:</P>
<P>MR. CASE, of Newburgh in this state, and his comrade, were sent to the Hospital from the ship Margaret, captain Bebee, both sick of the Yellow-Fever. As soon as the situation of Mr. Case was made known to his friends, his mother and brother hastened to see him. Mrs. Case and her son were un∣limited in their intercourse with their sick relation; and Mrs. Case remained with him, and performed all the duties of an affectionate mother and tender nurse, to the moment of his death, which happened on the sixth day of his illness. His comrade recovered.—Mr. Case, before his death, was as yellow as an orange; but neither the mother nor brother experi∣enced the least indisposition in consequence of their visit to the Hospital.</P>
<P>Two men were, from certain circumstances, re∣ceived into the Hospital, with fractured legs—they re∣mained in the same apartment with those ill of Yel∣low-Fever, and neither of them took the disease.</P>
<P>THESE facts are from my own knowledge; and impressed as I truly am with their importance, and particularly with the inferences which may be drawn from them, I cannot be too earnest in my attempts to impress them upon your Excellency.</P>
<P>IT is at all times an arduous undertaking to con∣quer prejudices; and it is commonly an unthankful office to rectify abuses which compel men to draw money from their pockets. The city of New-York,
<PB N="68" REF="035161_0066_1000C315E8799280"/>
which offers to its merchants the finest prospects of wealth, and to all its inhabitants the more pleasing one of health, if properly attended to, should be put in a situation which would render it capable of real∣izing both. The expence of doing this, is unworthy of notice, compared to the end when attained;—nay, the very expence is but another means of en∣hancing the value of property, as well as of securing the comforts of life. The legislature then, in ninety seven, have been commendably employed in sanction∣ing a system, <HI>which if completed,</HI> must be attended with effects incalculably beneficial.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to repeat, that as I have personally known all the facts previously stated, as well with re∣gard to the city as Lazaretto, and as I have personally conducted the operations of the Health-Office, I can vouch for their truth, and consider myself accountable for them.</P>
<P>BEING extremely desirous, as far as it is in my pow∣er, to render the establishment of the Health-Office, a real good to the people, I most heartily join the Com∣missioners in entreating your Excellency to make such a representation to the Legislature, as you may judge proper on this important subject.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been from time to time informed by the Commissioners of the last and of the present year, of the very unfit condition of the buildings on Bedlow's Island, to answer the purposes of a Lazaretto. I shall, therefore, only add, that there is the most pressing necessity for fixing the spot on which suitable and permanent buildings may be erected, so that the institution may be rendered as complete and useful as possible, before the ensuing season.</P>
<P>I WILL take my leave, by remarking to your Ex∣cellency, that the ready assistance which the Health Commissioners received from the Common Council,
<PB N="69" REF="035161_0067_1000B08AB3A976C0"/>

<P>A REPRESENTATION has been made to the Commissioners, that the present state of the Jail yard is exceptionable—in consequence of which, they, together with the Health Officer, visited it this morn∣ing, and are of opinion, that removing the rubbish daily, and keeping it as clean as possible hereafter, will not only conduce very greatly to the health and convenience of the family as well as the prisoners, but tend to prevent any bad effects upon the inhabitants in its vicinity, from an accumulation of offensive objects in the approaching warm season.</P>
<P>THEY are also of opinion, that if the walls of the different apartments, were repeatedly white washed, it would purify the air of the prison, and render it more wholesome.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners, therefore, beg leave to call your attention to this interesting object; and trust, that immediate measures will be taken to preclude the danger apprehended.</P>

<P>THE unfinished situation of the docks in Front-street, between Coenties and the Old slip, generally, was, in the opinion of the Commissioners of the Health Office, a source of disease in that neigh∣bourhood last year, and occasioned the death of seve∣ral valuable citizens. At that period it became a subject of remonstrance to the Common Council.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners cannot sufficiently regret, that they have reason to renew their remonstrances on this subject, and that its present situation is likely to be productive of still greater evils than those of last year.</P>
<P>SEVERAL persons have sickened in the neighbour∣hood of these unfinished grounds within a week, and with symptoms strikingly characteristic of Yellow-Fever.</P>
<P>IF the Common Council think proper to appoint two of their members, the Commissioners will meet

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been rumoured that the Yellow-Fever had made its appearance in town. It therefore seems proper that the Commissioners give your Excel∣lency the earliest information of the facts which, in their opinion, have led to it.</P>
<P>IN the spring of last year, the Commissioners, in one of their reports to the Common Council, remark∣ed that the whole east side of Front-street, from Coen∣ties to the Old slip, was in an unfinished and otherwise exceptionable state; and that their interposition was ne∣cessary to prevent the evils which, in hot weather, might result from it. Some difficulty arose at the time, which suspended the reforms contemplated. A few solitary cases of violent fever and death occurred in the vicini∣ty of that ground, in the course of last summer, which the Health-Officer and Commissioners have no doubt originated from the causes represented.</P>
<P>THEY expressed the same apprehensions in some of their subsequent reports to the Common Council; but fortunately nothing like a fever of a particular kind, has manifested itself in the whole city till within a few
<PB N="77" REF="035161_0075_1000C325CB26B4B0"/>
days. Several inhabitants in the neighbourhood of these docks and open lots (which are yet receptacles of filth, dirt and carrion) have been attacked, all with similar complaints, and, we have no doubt, from the causes before enumerated. The greater part, howe∣ver, are recovered or convalescent. The rest of the city is healthy. The Common Council have now tak∣en such measures as, we hope, will remedy the evils ap∣prehended from those sources, for the present.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Commissioners, in discharge of their duty, inform the Common Council, that the great mass of filth at the head of Cuyler's and Astor's lots, between Coenties and the Old slip, in Front street, is covered—that the operation is progressing—and that the sickness in that neighbourhood, has nearly subsid∣ed.</P>
<P>THEY are sorry to inform the board, that the dis∣ease, which occurred at the New slip and in its vicinity, has not so fortunately terminated. Nine persons are reported to have died there—five to be still sick—and nine or ten recovered, or removed into the country. Every thing which prudence suggested, or exertion could perform for the indigent, has been done in the course of the last week, and at as moderate an expence as possible to the public.</P>
<P>THE uncommon large body of water on Lispenard's meadow, north of his house, has subsided only about ten inches since the rains on Tuesday last, by the or∣dinary drain. It is the opinion of the Health Officer, that as soon as the surface of the meadow gets exposed to the influence of the sun, the exhalations arising from it, will generate disease in that neighbourhood. He therefore recommends a more sudden draining of it. The Commissioners have no doubt but the board will take such order on this subject, as the exigency may require.</P>
<P>A NUMBER of the inhabitants have frequently ex∣pressed a wish, that carts might be employed to take up the garbage and other offals, which, by standing in
<PB N="80" REF="035161_0078_1000B096E4FAD7B8"/>
confined places, from one sweeping day to another, become exceedingly offensive. The Commissioners have reflected more seriously on this subject, since the great heats set in, and believe it would be adviseable to remove them every Monday, Thursday and Satur∣day. They find that some of the Scavengers will per∣form this service by the day. If the board approve of an experiment, the Commissioners will agree with five men for the days above-mentioned till the last of Sep∣tember, as cheap as possible. They do not expect to exceed 12s. per day for each.</P>

<P>ON a representation from the keeper of the gaol this morning, that a back man was ill of fever there, Dr. Anderson was requested to visit him. Inclosed is his report. As the Commissioners do not conceive themselves authorized to remove prisoners, they beg leave to refer the case to the Magistracy.</P>

<P>THE removal of all spoiled pro∣visions from town, is now become indispensibly neces∣sary, for the preservation of the lives of our remaining fellow-citizens, independent of the continual clamours against the offensive smells arising from it.</P>
<P>You are therefore required to appoint a person to open your cellars, as well as that of the house of Pear∣sall and Pell, containing salted provisions, on Monday morning the 24th inst. for the purpose of having the whole inspected, and whatever may be found spoiled, removed out of town, to such place as you may direct.</P>
<P>THIS important business must not be delayed beyond the time limited—If it is, our duty will compel us to proceed immediately after, agreeable to the directions of the law passed the 30th of March last.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="035161_0083_1000C3313B53F918"/>
THE Commissioners, therefore, beseech you to pre∣vent this disagreeable extremity. Mr. Honson, the inspector, has examined several parcels. His mode of trying, is by boring into the cask with a small gimblet. If good, it remains in the cellar—if bad, he casts it in∣to the stream of the river.</P>
<P>IF you cannot provide a person to undertake this bu∣siness, the Commissioners of the Health-Office will, at your expence, engage Mr. Honson, and Mr. Fulkert∣son, a constable, to accomplish, it, on receiving your in∣structions for that purpose.</P>
<P>Your answer is requested by the bearer.</P>

<P>THIS morning a letter was received from Mr. Thomas Pearsall, without date, in reply to that of Commissioners of 22d. Inclosed was one for John A. Honson, packer of provisions, which was de∣livered him, and is in the words following:—</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Respected Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM requested by the Chairman of the Commissioners of the Health. Office, to have all the salt∣ed provisions belonging to our house, and Pearsall and Pell's examined by boring a hole in each cask. As the Chairman has mentioned thy name as having examined a considerable quantity of provisions, it is very agreeable to me, and my wish that thou should ex∣amine all the provisions I am interested in. I will, therefore, thank thee to undertake it as soon a possi∣ble.
<PB N="86" REF="035161_0084_1000B0A191EB0D28"/>
I also request thou wilt get sufficient assistance to put it up again in good order. If there should be any provisions spoiled, take down the marks; and where there are no marks, take down the brand, and keep the marks of ours and Pearsall and Pell's separate.—If any pork should be condemned, I will have that carted here, if agreeable to the Commissioners.</P>

<P><HI>P.S.</HI> Thomas Pearsall and Co.'s provisions are principally in Thomas Burling's cellar—some in Ross's cellar in John street. Pearsall and Pell's provisions are in a cellar in John street—I believe Ashe's. Z. Sic∣kles has the key of Burling's cellar. The rest of the Keys cannot be come at—they must therefore be bro∣ken open and locked again. Thomas Smith, Black∣smith, in Dey-street is my Smith, if <HI>wanted.</HI></P>

<P>YOUR favor of the 26th inst. has been received, and that inclosed, handed Mr. Honson.</P>
<P>HE assures us, that agreeably to your instructions, every cask in Ross's cellar, No. 63, John-street, was first bored, and that he found a number good, which
<PB N="87" REF="035161_0085_1000C334DE2DF7A8"/>
remain in the cellar; but the spoiled he has taken on board a vessel to examine, and when finished, he will replace them in the cellar. This is going on as expe∣peditiously, and, we believe, as well as possible.</P>
<P>WE have invariably attended to your interest in this business, and have no reason to think Mr. Honson is influenced by any other motive. If, however, there is any other packer whom you prefer, we can have no objection to his being employed; as Mr. Honson was proposed merely because he was in town, and had been in the constant practice of examining provisions for different Merchants.</P>
<P>WE are told that provisions have been improperly condemned and destroyed by barely boring—it, there∣fore, is certainly most for your interest, and best, to ex∣amine it in the manner practised by Mr. Honson.</P>
<P>IN consequence, however, of your orders, we have advised him to call on you, and explain all his pro∣ceedings. We have only to add, that the whole <HI>must</HI> be forth with examined, and the bad removed from town. We should be extremely sorry to be compell∣ed to have it taken out and sent you.</P>

<P>"THAT the Fever received <HI>additional</HI> malig∣nancy from the spoiled provisions stored in town, the Commissioners will admit; but they possess evidence sufficiently strong to induce them to believe, that it <HI>arose</HI> from other causes—namely, decayed docks, foul slips, lengthy sewers, and generally, the new-made, sunken and unfinished grounds on the east river; and that the foul air of spoiled beef, pork, and fish, which is the worst of the three, as well as every other im∣purity, served only to encrease the poison of the at∣mosphere, and extend its destructive influence:—for, in several streets, leading from those sources (and where no provisions were stored) the Fever appeared first, and, in its effects, proved equally mortal.</P>

<P>THE Commissioners will thank you to inform them, whether any instances of infection oc∣curred among the attendants at Bellevue Hospital, during your residence at that place:—and if there did, be so good as to mention the cases; the circum∣stances which, in your opinion gave rise to them; and in particular, the cause to which your attack is to be attributed.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it is the request of the Commissi∣oners of the Health Office, that I should inform them of the state of Bellevue Hospital during my residence there; as also, point out particularly the source from whence I supposed the fever with which I was so vio∣lently attacked, arose, I think it my duty to state to them a few circumstances, and explain the manner in which I conceive my disease to have originated.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="035161_0088_1000C33A48B09048"/>
MY attendance commenced on the 12th of June last. From that period, to the 14th of November, there were admitted into the Hospital, 389 patients, of which number perhaps three fourths were sick with pestilential fevers. The nurses employed during the same period, were 16 in number. The Health Office boatmen, who were in the habit of bringing the sick to the Hospital, as well from the city as ship∣ping, were accustomed to enter the Hospital at all times, and assist in placing as well as removing the sick from room to room. The number of Washer∣women during the season, was 7. Several persons were also constantly employed in cooking, preserving cleanliness, and burying the dead. There were, be∣sides, transient people, near relations of the sick, who were permitted by the Commissioners to visit occasion∣ally. Several persons accompanied their friends to Bellevue, staid with them, and nursed them during their illness. Under all these circumstances, to my knowledge, there happened no instance of infection, altho' an opinion has been adopted by many, that my sickness, whilst residing at Bellevue Hospital, arose from infection, imbibed at that place.</P>
<P>To what cause, then, is to be attributed the Fever with which I was seized at Bellevue on the 5th of October?</P>
<P>HAVING occasion to visit my friends in New-York, three days previous to my illness, and having unfor∣tunately slept in an highly infected part of the city, no doubt can exist with me, but it arose from that cause. In making this declaration, I must remark to you, that the situation of the medical attendants at Bellevue, was by no means a propitious one. Before the new buildings were erected for the acommodation of the sick, the Physician's room, (the only one they had) was literally surrounded by them. The room adjoin∣ing,—the front and back piazas—the hall—the rooms and hall in the second story—a room in the cellar
<PB N="91" REF="035161_0089_1000C33C1A7C9BF0"/>
that had been used for a kitchen, all contained sick,—THEY were, likewise, placed in several Chinese summer houses, in the small space between the main-house and the east river; and in the building erected for the purpose of a bathing-house. A large canvass was also erected (for want of a more convenient place) under the windows of the south-west part of the house, for the reception of the dying and the dead. I add, Sir, that under all the disadvantages enumerated, I know of no instance where infection resulted.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to conclude, by expressing the thanks due to the polite and humane attention of the Com∣missioners to myself, and to the sick in general; and I feel a pride in acknowledging, that to them—the ge∣nerous and persevering exertions of my preceptor, Dr. RICHARD BAYLEY, and the interposition of a kind Providence, I am indebted for my <HI>life.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Health-Office, <DATE>December 4th, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN addition to the facts which are con∣tained in the correspondence between the Health Com∣missioners and the Common Council for the year 1798, I shall offer to your consideration a few remarks upon the origin and progress of the pestilential disease which has lately prevailed in this city; and in order to cor∣roborate
<PB N="92" REF="035161_0090_1000B0A7F7FDA610"/>
what I may advance, I shall, in the first place take a retrospect of events which have annually taken place in this city during the warm months since the year 1795.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the records of the Health Office, the Yellow Fever appeared in 1796 at White-hall, at the foot of Pine-street, at Burling-slip, and in the neighbourhood of Rosevelt-street, sewer.</P>
<P>IN 1797 between Coenties and the Old-slip, in Front-street, at the Fly-market in several instances, in Flet∣cher-street, at Burling-slip, in Water-stret, adjoining Roosevelt-street, sewer, in George-street, and at the foot of Pine-street.</P>
<P>IN 1798 the disease first appeared about midway be∣tween Coenties and the Old-slip, in Front-street, be∣tween the 1st and 7th of August. On the 7th August about twenty-three were reported sick to the Health-Office. From that period several others sickened, and of the whole number one died. By the 26th of August, the complaint had disappeared in that quarter in consequence of the measures taken to remove the cause, by covering the offensive lots with clean, whole∣some earth.</P>
<P>ON the 12th of August, it appeared at No. 283, Water-street, in the case of Mr. Taylor, in an old broken building, on an unfinished lot at the foot of Dover-street, in which 11 persons died early in 1795, and which has since been repeatedly represented as a nuisance.</P>
<P>AUGUST 12, also, the disease appeared in the case of John Henderson, corner of James-street and Ba∣tavia lane. On all sides of his residence, which was a small crouded building, there were sunken lots in an unfinished state.</P>
<P>AGAIN, on August 12, the disease appeared in
<PB N="93" REF="035161_0091_1000C33E9ECCB848"/>
William Whitlock, Cardmaker, No. 51, Cherry-street. In the rear and to the south of his residence, the lots are very generally below the level of the streets, and without drains.</P>
<P>August 13. Murdock M'Lean, Bruce's wharf, was seized, where the disease has regularly made its appearance every warm season since the year 1795.</P>
<P>THE first arrival of sick in this harbour (to the knowledge of the Health-Office) from Philadelphia, was on the 13th of August, in the New-York and Phi∣ladelphia Packet. The Captain died on the passage—the Mate was sick and was sent to Bellevue.</P>

ON the morning of the 14th, the heaviest rain fell of any time during the year. It began at 5 A. M. and continued without intermission till nine. Numerous cellars, particularly those in the low parts of the city, were filled with water. Lispenard's meadow, which may be considered as within the limits of the city, was entirely overflowed. In six days it had not subsided above ten inches; and the water did not pass off, till a large drain was opened for that purpose, by order of the Common Council.</P>

<P>THE sudden and great increase of heat immediately after the violent rain, appeared to have a proportio∣nate influence in producing fever. Between that pe∣riod and the 22d August, upwards of twenty persons in Cliff-street, were seized with slight indispositions, which they attributed to sleeping with open windows during the preceding hot and moist weather, but which appeared rather as the forerunner of yellow fever, for, not only the persons thus indisposed, but a number of others <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same street, had that disease in the course of a few days.</P>
<P>FROM this period the disease became more general; but its fatality was principally felt in Cliff-street and its neighbourhood, at Catharine slip, in Water-street, and on the unfinished grounds in the southern part of the city.</P>
<P>NOW, having seen that the yellow fever has made its appearance in New-York every year, for several years past, but has prevailed in very different degrees, it becomes a matter of great importance to determine,
<PB N="95" REF="035161_0093_1000C34140EE3478"/>
why the disease was so generally prevalent on the low new-made grounds in this city in 1795, whilst it was scarcely felt in the more elevated situations; why, in 1796 and 1797, its appearance was limited to particu∣lar spots; and why, in 1798 it not only prevailed on all the new-made grounds, but also in parts of the city which had before been exempted from the disease.</P>
<P>To answer these questions in such manner, as to prove satisfactory to every one, might be a very diffi∣cult task. I shall, however, offer some reasons which may tend to shew why the fever was more prevalent this year, than in the preceding years.</P>
<P>IT is well ascertained that in the year 1795, there was an unusual degree of heat and moisture in the at∣mosphere during the warmer months—that the Ther∣mometer was considerably higher than in 1796 and 1797, but that in 1798, the heat greatly exceeded that of 1795.</P>
<P>Now, as heat and moisture are powerful agents in <HI>producing</HI> pestilential diseases, so must the same causes necessarily promote the <HI>extension</HI> of those dis∣eases.</P>
<P>IN the year '98, there were besides, local causes of fever in this city, which did not exist in the other seasons, and which, co-operating with the weather, served to extend the disease beyond the limits, to which it would probably have been otherwise con∣fined. I have reference to the immense quantities of spoiled beef, fish, and other articles of a perishable nature which were stored in different parts of this city. The noxious exhalations arising from these sources, in my apprehension was a great cause why, the disease arose and raged with great violence in par∣ticular situations: And when we consider the sudden appearance of the fever on Golden-Hill and in Cliff-street, and the great number which sickened
<PB N="96" REF="035161_0094_1000C343937DCEA0"/>
nearly at the same time, there is great reason to believe this opinion well founded.</P>
<P>ABOUT the 20th of August, a report was made to the Health Office, that great quantities of spoiled beef were stored in Pearl-steet, between Burling and Beekman-slips. The stench which issued from some of the cellars in this situation, was so considerable, as to prove very offensive to those who passed by, and became a subject of general observation. Letters, in consequence, from the Health Office, were address∣ed to the owners of provisions in that quarter, en∣joining them to have the beef examined, and to have such as was spoiled, sent out of the city. Instead, however, of adopting this plan, the beef was brought from the cellars into the street, the barrels opened, and the putrid pickle thrown into the gutters. In some instances the examination was made in the cel∣lars, and the pickle disposed of in the same manner. The gutters which conveyed away this putrid pickle, led to Burling-slip sewer.</P>
<P>THE relative situation of this sewer, and Cliff-street is such that the southerly and south-easterly winds, force a current of air through the sewer, car∣rying with it the exhalations arising from the noxious matters collected together in that place, and having a direction to pass more immediately up Golden-Hill, and into Cliff-street; and every person in that neigh∣bourhood with whom I have conversed, agrees as to the offensive smell of the air, previous to the ap∣pearance of the fever.</P>
<P>ON the 20th of August, the wind, which had been blowing from the north and west some days previous, shifted to the south-east, and continued to blow from that quarter some time. In 48 hours after this, there was scarcely a house in Pearl-street, near where the spoiled provisions were stored, in the lower end of
<PB N="97" REF="035161_0095_1000C345C30EBAE8"/>
John-street, and in Cliff-street, which did not contain sick.</P>
<P>THE sudden appearance of fever in this part of the city, and the great number which were affected in so short a time, proves the local nature of the cause; and to the one which I have just mentioned, I have no hesitation, in ascribing all the effects which were experienced.</P>
<P>IF what we have alledged, be admitted sufficient to explain the appearance of Fever which took place in Cliff-street, &amp;c. we have made some advances to∣wards accounting for the general prevalence of the disease in 1798.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide the H. Office correspondence on the subject of spoiled provisions.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT, Gentlemen, we have further to remark, a particular difference in the warm seasons, of 1798 and 1795.</P>
<P>IN 1795 the weather was warm and moist, but there was but very little rain.</P>
<P>IN 1798, the weather was not only much warmer, but was accompanied with sudden and heavy rains.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the rains, the Public papers teemed with addresses to the citizens, entreating them to empty their cellars of the water which had collect∣ed in them, or the most fatal effects would be felt from neglect, or inattention to this circumstance.—It is not my intention to dispute the opinion advanced by these writers. But, if the production of disease, was to be apprehended from the lodgment of water in places where the sun's rays never enter, what ef∣fects were to be expected from the ponding of water in those numerous lots and yards within this city,
<PB N="98" REF="035161_0096_1000B0B230C3DF18"/>
which are several feet below the level of the streets, containing dead animal and vegetable matters, and to which the rays of the sun have full access? I wish, you, Gentlemen, to reflect seriously upon this comparison, and believe, that whilst those sunken, undrained lots are suffered to remain in their present state, unless causes cease to produce their effects, diseases must inevitably result.</P>
<P>ON examining the records of the Legislature of this state, it will be found, that petitions have been preferr∣ed to that body, for permission to erect mill-dams on certain streams of water in some of the northern coun∣ties, and the prayer of the petitioners has been grant∣ed. The consequence was, that considerable tracts of low grounds in the neighbourhood of the mill-dams, were overflowed in the spring, and after the water had passed off, and the surface of those grounds were ex∣posed to the influence of the sun, exhalations of so baneful a nature arose, as to produce a fever of the bilious type, which attacked almost every body within a certain distance from their source, and proved very mortal in its effects. The cause of this sickness being so obvious, petitions were presented to the Legislature, praying for a redress of the grievances. To correct the evil, it of course was necessary to destroy the mill∣dams, and as soon as the waters were unobstructed and allowed to flow in their usual channel, the conutry be∣came as healthy as before.</P>
<P>PERMIT me, Gentlemen, to ask the following questions:—If the result of exhalations arising from grounds which have been covered with water in an open country, has been the production of bilious remitting fevers, attended with considerable mortality, what result ought we to expect from those exhalations which arise from the ponding of water on 150 acres of low grounds and sunken yards and lots in a crouded city, and of a southern aspect?</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="035161_0097_1000C34851221FA8"/>
BEFORE I conclude, I shall take the liberty of noticing some of the public measures that have been adopted for the removal of causes of disease in this city. I shall confine myself to two principal objects:</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> THE want of a sufficient descent on the low grounds along the east river, to carry off the waters from the streets, is generally admitted. A conside∣rable quantity of water must necessarily stagnate in the gutters of these streets, and also in the sunken pave∣ment. In dry weather, this lodgement consists princi∣pally of water which has been used for culinary and other family purposes, and must therefore, be suppos∣ed to abound with matters to afford noxious exhala∣tions.</P>
<P>BY an ordinance of the Corporation for cleaning the streets, the inhabitants are directed to scrape out the dirt and filth collected in the gutters and heap them up in the streets, to be removed by the scavengers <HI>in the course of the day.</HI></P>
<P>Now, does this regulation in any degree subserve the purposes for which it was ordained? Does not the spreading of this dirt and filth, and exposing new and greater surfaces, increase the mischief which the mea∣sure was intended to correct? I believe, gentlemen, there will be found no other means to rid the low grounds of this city, from the baneful effects of stag∣nant waters, and an accumulation of noxious matters, than their being freely washed by currents of water flowing over them.</P>
<P>2d. IN the same ordinance, the citizens are prohibited from throwing into the streets, from their respective houses, cellars, or yards any dirt, filth, or offals whatever, except on certain days. How will this be found, to operate in <HI>removing</HI> the causes of disease? Should we not rather ask, how this will be found to operate in <HI>increasing</HI> the causes of disease? One mo∣ment's
<PB N="100" REF="035161_0098_1000C34B113C6A20"/>
reflection, I presume, will convince us that some means ought to be adopted to remedy a system so fraught with mischief, and for these means I take the liberty of referring you to letter 70, addressed by the Commissioners of the Health-Office to the Com∣mon Council.</P>
