<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>WE read of such a Remarkable Thing once falling out; Psal. CV. 41. <HI>He opened the Rock, and the Waters gushed out.</HI> O Heart of Mankind; What art thou but a <HI>Rock?</HI> Harder than the <HI>Rock</HI>; than the Nether Milstone. The Essay we are now upon, is to Smite the <HI>Rock. Heart-breaking Objects</HI> are in this Essay brought unto the Readers. May the Issue be, that the <HI>Smitten Rock,</HI> shall break and flow. Let the <HI>Waters</HI> of agreeable <HI>Tears</HI> now <HI>Gush out</HI>; The <HI>Tears</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> for thy own Miscarriages, O Sinful Man; and the <HI>Tears</HI> of <HI>Compassion</HI> for the Mis∣carriages and Miseries of Other Men.

Mine Eye Affecteth mine Heart.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Wish, that another Sense may now have the like Operation; That the <HI>Ear</HI> may also <HI>affect the Heart</HI>; That when the <HI>Heart-affecting</HI> Objects your <HI>Eyes</HI> may find in the World about you, do strike upon your <HI>Ears</HI> in our Enumeration of them, the <HI>Hearers</HI> may be <HI>Heartily affected</HI> with it. <HI>My Hearers,</HI> You must shut your <HI>Eyes,</HI> and stop your <HI>Ears,</HI> &amp; stupisy all your <HI>Affections,</HI> if you take not an <HI>Affectionate Notice</HI> of the Things, which
<PB N="4" REF="001507_0003_0fb3802092548528"/>
I am going to set before you. Among the rest, I intend a very <HI>Particular Notice</HI> of some Observable Things which seem to be Evident <HI>Judgments</HI> quickly overtaking such as have been given up to more than ordi∣nary Wickedness, both here, and in some other Places.</P>
<P>It was an Ancient Observation; Eccl. VIII. 11. <HI>Because Sentence against an Evil Work is not Executed speedily, therefore the Heart of the Sons of Men, is fully set in them to do Evil.</HI> But since we have seen more than once the Wrath of God <HI>Executed Speedily,</HI> and so Dreadfully upon some <HI>Evil Workers,</HI> it may be Hoped, the <HI>Hearts</HI> of men will be <HI>Affected</HI> with it, and the <HI>Hearts</HI> of some, not so <HI>fully set in them to do Evil,</HI> as they use to be.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prophet</HI> and <HI>Poet,</HI> who made the <HI>Lamentations,</HI> that afford our Text unto us, had at this time a most <HI>Heart-affecting sight</HI> before his Eyes. The whole BOOK of <HI>Lamentations</HI> is written, to tell you what it was. And the Clause that next follows the Text, more particularly does tell you,
<PB N="5" REF="001507_0003_0fb3802092548528"/>
It was, <HI>Because of all the Daughters of my City.</HI> The <HI>Chaldeans</HI> had made fearful Ravages upon the <HI>Country Towns,</HI> which were the <HI>Daughters</HI> of the Capital City. <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was the <HI>Mother of them all. Jerusalem</HI> was also expecting the same Lamentable Fate, with her <HI>Daughters.</HI> Yea, She had already Drunk very deep of the Cup; she had al∣ready been once Taken, and Plundred, &amp; Spoiled, &amp; miserably Circumstanced. Now, says he, <HI>Mine Eye affecteth mine Heart</HI>! O Servant of God, what was in thine <HI>Eye</HI>? He had in his <HI>Eye,</HI> whole Towns laid in Ashes, by a Barbarous Enemy, a <HI>Bitter &amp; Hasty Nation</HI>; tho' far less Barbarous &amp; Bloody than One at this Day running a∣muck among the Nations! He had in his <HI>Eye,</HI> multitudes of his Brethren, led away <HI>Captives</HI> by Cruel <HI>Babylonians</HI>; Multitudes Massacred and Murdered, and made a Sa∣crifice to the Fury of a Terrible <HI>Tyrant.</HI> He had in his <HI>Eye,</HI> the Effects of raging <HI>Famine</HI> &amp; <HI>Sickness</HI>; All Order overturned; Universal Confusion raging every where; the Symptoms of a Total Desolation ap∣proaching. It must be an <HI>Heart of Ada∣mant,</HI> that would not be <HI>affected</HI> with the
<PB N="6" REF="001507_0004_0fb380221b5f2fd8"/>
Report, which an <HI>Eye</HI> beholding such <HI>Spectacles</HI> must give unto it.</P>
<P>But the DOCTRINE which I am now to give you is this.</P>
<P><HI>When we have Heart-affecting Spectacles before our Eyes, we should be Heartily affected with them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Eye</HI> should <HI>affect</HI> the <HI>Heart,</HI> when we see with our <HI>Eye,</HI> what should not be seen without an <HI>affected Heart.</HI></P>
<P>First. <HI>Wonder not</HI> at it, That the World is filled with <HI>Heart affecting Spectacles</HI>; yea, with <HI>Miserable Spectacles.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>First</HI> of the <HI>Heart affecting Specta∣cles,</HI> is the <HI>Worst</HI> of them all; that is, The SIN, the SIN of the world: this tis that has brought in the rest. The Sum of the <HI>Heart-affecting Spectacles</HI> in the world, is that; Lam. V. 16. <HI>We unto us, that we have Sinned.</HI> First, we see <HI>Sin</HI> breaking in upon the World; a <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> by our Fall from God▪ breaking in, and carrying all before it. O Spectacle full of Horror! O Hard <HI>Heart,</HI> O Base <HI>Heart,</HI> that is not Affected with it! The Death which we see to be the
<PB N="7" REF="001507_0004_0fb380221b5f2fd8"/>
<HI>Wages of Sin</HI>; the Evil which we see <HI>Pur∣suing of Sinners</HI>; the Wrath of God which we see Overtaking and Overwhelming the <HI>Children of Disobedience</HI>; This 'tis, that makes every Corner of the world, full of Heart-affecting Spectacles. I am sure, the <HI>Redeemer</HI> of the World so accounted of them.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>How</HI> should our <HI>Hearts</HI> be <HI>af∣fected</HI> with such <HI>Heart-affecting Spectacles</HI>?</P>
<P>Not with <HI>Wonder,</HI> or <HI>Murmur,</HI> I have told you. But I answer; <HI>Variously.</HI> Ac∣cording to the <HI>Various Nature</HI> of the Specta∣cles.</P>
<P>When our <HI>Eye</HI> shows us a Miserable Spectacle, it must affect our <HI>Heart</HI> with <HI>Commiseration.</HI> We should heartily Com∣miserate the Miserable; our Heart should be touched with a <HI>Compassion</HI> for them. So we read, Job XXX. 25. <HI>Did not I weep for him that was in Trouble? Was not my Soul grieved for the Poor</HI>?</P>
<P>If there be Sin joyned with Misery in the Spectacle, there must be <HI>Anger,</HI> there must be <HI>Anguish,</HI> joyned with the <HI>Compassion.</HI> We must be <HI>angry &amp; not sin</HI>; we must there∣fore be <HI>angry at sin.</HI> Our <HI>Heart</HI> must be
<PB N="8" REF="001507_0005_0fb3802391199fe0"/>
Affected with a just Indignation at every Sin. So we read, 2 Pet. II. 7, 8. <HI>Just</HI> Lot <HI>was Vexed with the filthy Conversation of the Wicked; That Righteous man dwelling a∣mong them, in Seeing and Hearing, Vexed his Righteous Soul from day to day, with their unlawful Deeds.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this all the <HI>affection</HI> that is now called for. When we see Sin committed, we should be moved with Fear. Sin does Expose men to the Judgments of God. When we see Sin, we should Fear, lest the Judgments of God befal the Sinner; yea, and those that are about him also. Thus we read; Psal. CXIX. 118, 120. <HI>Thou hast trodden down all them that Err from thy Statutes; My Flesh trembles for fear of thee, &amp; I am afraid of thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udgments.</HI></P>
<P>But then, methinks we may see occasions for Thankfulness, even in every Miserable Spectacle. We should have our Hearts Affected with a Thankful Admiration at the Distinguishing Favours of God unto our selves. <Q>Lord, Why am not I such a Spectacle? Why is not this my Un∣happiness? Tis what I have deserved, as much as any in the world.</Q> In the
<PB N="9" REF="001507_0005_0fb3802391199fe0"/>
midst of <HI>Lamentations,</HI> we have those Ac∣knowledgments; Lam. III. 22. <HI>It is of the Lords Mercies that we are not Consumed: because His Compassions fail not.</HI></P>
<P>The proper <HI>affections</HI> on such <HI>Spectacles</HI> are not yet all fully <HI>to the Life</HI> Expressed. Something must be produced <HI>in the Life.</HI> Our Affections must produce Affectionate Resolutions to Do all the <HI>Good</HI> that we can. We are affectionately to Devise Good, for the Relief of the Heart-affecting Specta∣cles. Or, the Spectacles are to mind us of some <HI>Good</HI> that we must Resolve to do for our Selves, or Others. We must be provoked unto some Holy and Useful Re∣solutions. We must fetch some Good out of Evil Spectacles, Think, <Q>Wherein must I be the better, by what I see?</Q> Think, <Q>What shall I do, that Others may be the Better for what I see?</Q></P>
<P>To Illustrate this matter, there can be nothing so Suitably, nothing so Cogently, set before you, as the Example of the ad∣mirable JESUS. To introduce on all Occasions, the mention of His <HI>Glories,</HI> you know, tis the Spirit, the Study, the <HI>Salt</HI> of our Ministry.</P>
<P>Our Amiable and Admirable JESUS,
<PB N="10" REF="001507_0006_0fb3802532fc1020"/>
had often before Him, Heart-affecting Spectacles. How did He Entertain them? We read, <HI>He was Grieved.</HI> We read, <HI>He Sigh'd.</HI> We read, <HI>He Wept.</HI> We read, <HI>He was moved with Compassion.</HI> His Holy Soul was full of Agony. Oh, How He laid to Heart, the Evil which He saw that the First <HI>Adam</HI> had brought upon the World! His Heart broke, and bled upon it! When He saw any Good, He Cried out, <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven &amp; Earth</HI>! And for the Good He did! He went a∣bout, still doing of Good. Yea, the Sun in the Firmament, it never did the Good, that was done by this Brighter Sun of Righteousness.</P>
<P>¶ I am now ready to set before your <HI>Eyes,</HI> O Congregation of the Lord, a Number of <HI>Heart-affecting Spectacles.</HI> They are <HI>Made</HI> already. They need only to be <HI>Shown.</HI> It may be, some of you have ne∣ver taken due Notice of them. I am going therewithal to show you, How your Hearts are to be Affected with them.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Look Inward.</HI> The First Counsel, to
<PB N="11" REF="001507_0006_0fb3802532fc1020"/>
be always given; <HI>Look Inward.</HI> Let eve∣ry Man, and especially every Unregenerate Man, Look Inward upon the state of his own SOUL; And, Oh, Let him own it, a most Heart-affecting Spectacle. Man, Cast an <HI>Eye</HI> upon thy own Soul! Say, was there ever such a woful, such a rueful Spectacle? What a Spectacle is the <HI>Leper</HI>? Or, the Creature described, Isa. I. 6. <HI>From the sole of the Foot, even unto the Head, no soundness; but wounds, &amp; bruises, &amp; putri∣fying sores</HI>! Thy Soul, thy Soul, is under such a Leprosy. A Soul Wounded in all its Faculties. Blind, unable to see Truth; Lame, Unable to do Right. A Soul, full of Enmity to GOD, and all Goodness. A Soul, Depraved with most Vicious Inclinations. A Soul, Enslaved unto Sa∣tan, and the Powers of Darkness. A Soul, Born under the Guilt of Original sin, and by the Guilt of That; and, Oh! what an Enormous Heap of Actual sin! bound over to suffer the strange Punishment, which the Justice of God assigns to the Workers of Iniquity. A Perishing SOUL! A Soul every moment in danger of Eter∣nal Perdition! Verily, An Unregenerate
<PB N="12" REF="001507_0007_0fb3802ce3ae52b8"/>
Soul, is the most Lamentable Spectacle in the World! Imagine a man Deformed in every <HI>Limb,</HI> Deprived of every <HI>Sense</HI>; Over-run with Loathsome <HI>Ulcers.</HI> Ima∣gine a Poor Man, <HI>Starving</HI> to Death, or Burning at the <HI>Stake,</HI> or Breaking on the <HI>Rack; Tragical Spectacles!</HI> O <HI>Unre∣generate,</HI> Thy SOUL, Thy SOUL, is worse than all of This. What a <HI>Specta∣cle</HI> is foretold; Deut. XXVIII. 67. <HI>In the Morning thou shalt say, Would God it were Evening: And at Evening thou shalt say, Would God it were Morning: for the Fear of thine Heart, wherewith thou shalt fear, &amp; for the sight of thine Eyes, which thou shalt see.</HI> Alas, Alas, Unregenerate; The <HI>sight of thine Eyes,</HI> which thou mayst see, is as Astonishing!</P>
<P>My Friend, This, this is the <HI>Spectacle</HI> before thine Eyes. How canst thou turn away thine Eyes, from the Beholding of it? The first thing that in the Name of God, and for the Love of thy <HI>Soul,</HI> I demand of thee, is, <HI>To consider the state of thy own Soul.</HI> Oh! Take Time to do it in secret places.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001507_0007_0fb3802ce3ae52b8"/>But then; Shall not <HI>Thine Eye affect thine Heart</HI>? The Heart of an Unregene∣rate sinner, should be Affected, first, with an affrighting Ashonishment at his own Condition, Sinner, Let thine Eye Affect thine Heart, into that Cry; Rom. VII. 24. <HI>O wretched One that I am, who shall de∣liver me</HI>? Think; <Q>Oh! The Wretched∣ness of my present Condition! What, what will become of me, if I Dy in this Con∣dition!</Q> Retire for such Thoughts. De∣vote some <HI>Time</HI> to these Thoughts. If this One Thing were obtained from the Hearers, what an Introduction might it prove, to all manner of Good! Oh! Most <HI>Obdurate Heart!</HI> If the Condition of thy SOUL will not Affect it, so much as this comes to; not so much as to make thee Think upon it.</P>
<P>But then; Secondly; The Heart of such an one, should be Affected into Earnest Essays, to make Haste out of this Condi∣tion. O Heart of stone; Be at last, at least, so much Affected as to say, <Q>I must not continue in this Condition! I Re∣solve that I will immediately Cry to the God of all Grace, that He would
<PB N="14" REF="001507_0008_0fb38185caa63628"/>
bring me out of this Horrible Pit!</Q> An Heart suitably Affected with the Mischiefs and the Dangers of Unregeneracy, will immediately fall down before the Lord, with a Supplication, the Cry where of shall reach and pierce the very Heavens; That Supplication; Psal. CXVI. 4. <HI>O Lord, I be∣seech thee, Deliver my Soul.</HI> A Person whose Heart is Affected with the doleful <HI>Chains of Darkness,</HI> which Unregeneracy holds him in, will <HI>Immediately</HI> fly to the only Saviour; <HI>Immediately</HI> Plead the <HI>Sa∣crifice</HI> of his only Saviour, that God may be Reconciled unto him; <HI>Immediately</HI> lay hold on the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of his only Sa∣viour, that he may stand in that with safety before the Judment-seat of God; <HI>Immedi∣ately</HI> Embrace the Laws of the Holy Lord, as the Rules of his Life; and Enter into Cove∣nant with God; Comply with all the Ar∣ticles in the Covenant of Grace; Cry out, <HI>Lord, I am Thine, save me.</HI> O Unaffected Heart; How canst thou bear, to let thy Soul remain an Exile from God, a Brand of Hell, a Prey to Devils! Let the sight which thine Eye gives thee in thy own Soul, have that Issue; Psal. CXIX. 59, 60.
<PB N="15" REF="001507_0008_0fb38185caa63628"/>
<HI>I thought on my ways, &amp; I turned my Feet unto thy Testimonies. I made haste, &amp; I de∣layed not to keep thy Commandments.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Look Abroad.</HI> There is a world of SIN committed in the world; This is the most <HI>General,</HI> but indeed the most <HI>Sorrowful Spectacle,</HI> in the world. We read, 1 Joh. V. 19. <HI>The whole World lies in wickedness.</HI> The <HI>World</HI> is Drowned in <HI>Ignorance,</HI> in <HI>Cor∣ruption.</HI> Satan, the Wicked One, Rules: When he <HI>goes to and fro on the Earth, and walks up and down in it,</HI> he does little other than go in Progress thro' his own Domi∣nions. <HI>Idolatry</HI> Reigns <HI>Superstition</HI> Reigns, <HI>Vice</HI> Reigns; Oppression, Fraudulence, Impurity, all manner of Wickedness. Few Nations have any really or visibly Godly People in them. The Body of Mankind are in Actual Rebellion against God; Actu∣ally up in Arms against the Things that are Holy and Just and Good. Where any Godly People are to be met withal, they are but Few; A <HI>Little, Little Flock</HI>! Their <HI>Enemies fill the Countrey's.</HI> The World hates them; They are most Unreasonably Persecuted by the World.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="001507_0009_0fb38187108ab9d8"/>In our Nation, what Abominable Things are done continually! Our late King, often spoke it unto the Clerk of his Closet; That <HI>he found the English Nation a very wicked Nation.</HI> Great <HI>Britain,</HI> is a very Polluted Island; a Land full of Bloody Crimes. There goes up a Cry from that Land, in the Ears of the <HI>Lord of Sabaoth</HI>; Such a Cry that we may stand amazed at the Patience of Heaven, that it is <HI>Reprieved</HI> from fearful Desolations; we may tremble to see the Predictions of our Famous <HI>Hooker</HI> making such Approaches towards a dreadful Ac∣complishment. [See, His Life, in <HI>Magna∣lia Americana,</HI> Book III. Pag. 62, 63.]</P>
<P>There is a Faithful, and Worthy Man, Dr. <HI>John Edwards</HI>; who has lately obli∣ged the Publick, with a Printed Sermon, on the Heinousness of the Sins of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> That Servant of God, with a Cou∣rage well becoming such an one, hath E∣numerated horrendous Instances, wherein the Land hath grievously Sinned. I will Recite some of his words. <HI>He says</HI>; <Q>There has been a shameful Degeneracy from those Christian Principles, which some brand with the Odious Name (as
<PB N="17" REF="001507_0009_0fb38187108ab9d8"/>
they accout it) of <HI>Calvinism.</HI> But it is plain to any Discerning man, that the Preaching of the Contrary Doctrines, hath given a New Turn to our Man∣ners. It is Evident unto an impartial Observer, that for these Thirty or Forty Years, (the time they have been upheld and maintained by the Generality of our Preachers) Profaneness, Impiety, Scep∣ticism, Debauchery have had an unusual Ascendent over us.</Q> He <HI>says,</HI> <Q>The Countrey was known in former Times, to be a place of Innocency and Simpli∣city. But it may cause Amazement to see, how these Places are changed of late, &amp; over-run with all manner of Vice; Those Disorders which were, as it were, proper to Cities, are now come among the Inhabitants of these Parts. <HI>He sayes</HI>; It is true, God may Save us, by His So∣vereignty and Prerogative; which we have no Ground to Rely upon. But if He proceeds according to His usual Me∣thod, and according to the Laws of His Declared Will, we have no Reason to look for any thing but Ruine and De∣struction!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="001507_0010_0fb3818ad10be828"/>And this <HI>Our Land</HI>; a Land under such Obligations to be a Land of Uprightness: what prevailing Iniquities threaten the Ruine of it? The Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God, we may see, tis very Little, very Little, Hearkened to. We may see, the Spirit of this World, Eating out, Eating up, the Spirit and Power of Godliness. We may see a Scandalous <HI>Dishonesty</HI> in the Dealings of too too many. We may see <HI>Drunkenness</HI> likely to Extinguish all Good Order in many places; and a <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Rum</HI> and Ruine, Vomited out of the Mouth of the Dragon, likely to swallow up the <HI>Wo∣man fled into the Wilderness.</HI> We may see the Crimes of <HI>Unchastity</HI> Debauching too too many; yea, the too well known <HI>House of the Harlot</HI> resorted to. And we may see many <HI>Ungoverned</HI> Families, <HI>Unnurtured</HI> Families; a scandalous Neglect of House∣hold Piety. O horrid <HI>Spectacle</HI>! Where, where shall we look, and not see such a <HI>Spectacle</HI>!</P>
<P>But, How should our <HI>Heart</HI> be <HI>Affected</HI> with what we see?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="001507_0010_0fb3818ad10be828"/>First; Be sure, <HI>Sorrow, Sorrow,</HI> is the <HI>Affection,</HI> which the <HI>Spectacle</HI> does call for. The sight of <HI>Sin,</HI> wherever we see it, should always broach our <HI>Sorrow.</HI> Oh! Let the Sinfulness of the World, and particularly, peculiarly, our part of the World, which lies most nearly before our Eyes, let it <HI>affect</HI> us at that rate; Psal. CXIX. 136, 158. <HI>Rivers of Waters run down mine Eyes, because they keep not thy Law. I beheld the Transgressors &amp; was Grieved, because they kept not thy Word.</HI> No doubt, Here are some, that in their Travels have had a sight of <HI>Bedlam.</HI> If they were in a Sober Mind when they saw it, it Grieved them to see such a Collection of <HI>Madmen</HI>; the sight is a Grievous One! Sirs, The Sinful World, is little better than an Entire <HI>Bed∣lam</HI>; Tis full of Mad-men; All Sinners are Mad-men! With what Affliction, if we have any Love to Mankind, with what Affliction, must we say of the Foolish and Hurtful Things that we see done every Day; <HI>Poor Creatures, They know not what they do!</HI> Oh! To see Mankind almost every where, acted with nothing but Mad∣ness: Every where playing the parts and
<PB N="20" REF="001507_0011_0fb3824f3af2d5e8"/>
pranks of Mad-men; It should <HI>afflict</HI> us wonderfully! If we are the Children of God, or have any Hope, of His Looking on us, as He uses on them that Love His Name; it must <HI>affect</HI> us and <HI>afflict</HI> us, to see His Name Dishonoured among the Chil∣dren of men.</P>
<P>But then, I must add, That <HI>Abhorrence</HI> is another <HI>affection,</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Spectacle.</HI> Our Affection must be an A∣version, for the Sins that we see in other People. When others <HI>make void the Law</HI> of our God, Therefore, <HI>Therefore,</HI> Let us <HI>Love it above Gold, yea, above fine Gold; and Hate every False way.</HI> When we see Ill Things, Vile Things, done by other men, it should so Affect us, as to make us Avoid those Things, and be able to say with him; Neh. V. 15. <HI>But so did not I, because of the Fear of GOD.</HI> I have known some, who have Lived with <HI>Parents</HI> or <HI>Masters,</HI> which took very Bad Courses. The <HI>fight</HI> of the <HI>Sin</HI> in those whom they Lived withal, it look'd so Odious to them, it has made them <HI>abhor</HI> those Bad Courses.

<P><PB N="21" REF="001507_0011_0fb3824f3af2d5e8"/>This is not all. The <HI>sight</HI> of the <HI>sin in Others,</HI> must <HI>affect</HI> us with a <HI>Fear of our Selves.</HI> Be afraid, be afraid at what you see. Think, <Q>If the Sovereign GOD should leave me to my self, I should soon do as Bad, as the worst in the World.</Q> We see no <HI>sin</HI> any where, but we have in our own <HI>Heart,</HI> the Seed of that very Sin. Christian, Thou dost not <HI>Know</HI> thy own <HI>Heart,</HI> if thou dost not <HI>Fear</HI> thy own <HI>Heart.</HI> It is wholesome Advice; 1 Cor.

<P>Finally; Labour to <HI>Suppress,</HI> to <HI>Restrain,</HI> to <HI>Reform,</HI> the provoking Evils that we see. When we see Sin gaining upon our Neighbourhood, it must Affect us, and Ex∣cite us to Do what may be done for the <HI>Reformation</HI> of these Evils. The sight must make us Unite in our Endeavours, ac∣cording to every ones Ability and Capa∣city, for a <HI>Reformation.</HI> Thus, Thus we shall procure a precious <HI>Mark</HI> from God upon us; That <HI>Mark</HI>; Ezek.

The <HI>Calamities</HI> of the World, the <HI>Destructions</HI> of the World; Methinks, They are <HI>Heart-breaking Spectacles.</HI> I now make you that Invitation; Psal. XLVI. 8. <HI>Come, Behold the works of the Lord, what Desola∣tions He hath made in the Earth.</HI> Look where you will over the face of the whole Earth, you may see the God of Heaven, <HI>Distributing Sorrows in His Anger.</HI> The Earth under the <HI>Curse</HI> of God for the Sin of Man, brings forth, Oh! what <HI>Thorns</HI> unto him! That word is every where fulfill'd in the world; Isa.

<P N="4">IV. The <HI>Afflicted</HI> that are about us in our next Neighbourhood; These are <HI>Specta∣cles</HI> that we have near unto us; before our <HI>Eyes; Heart affecting Spectacles.</HI> We read, Psal. XLI. 1. <HI>Blessed is he that Considers the Poor.</HI> There are those that Consider, who
<PB N="24" REF="001507_0013_0fb382555b76d688"/>
are the <HI>Poor,</HI> and Consider, what may be done for them. If you look about you with a Considerate <HI>Eye,</HI> you may <HI>See</HI> some <HI>Sick</HI> &amp; <HI>Weak</HI>; perhaps they are Chastened with <HI>Pain,</HI> with <HI>strong Pain.</HI> You may <HI>see</HI> some Conflicting with <HI>Poverty.</HI> I cer∣tainly know, that there are some Scores in this Town, real Objects of Charity, on that one Score of Straitning <HI>Poverty.</HI> There are many more, whose <HI>Afflictions</HI> are heavy. Can there be so many <HI>Widows,</HI> and so many <HI>Orphans,</HI> and not very many under sore <HI>afflictions</HI>? Many there are, whose <HI>Temp∣tations</HI> make them Cry to us, <HI>Have Pity on me, O my</HI> Friends, <HI>Have Pity on me; You see what an</HI> Hand <HI>has touched me</HI>!</P>
<P>Such Things we may <HI>see</HI> every Day. But, How should our <HI>Hearts</HI> be <HI>affected</HI> with the <HI>fight?</HI> Why,</P>
<P>First; Be <HI>Thankfully</HI> Affected. How Thank∣ful, How Thankful should we be, that the Afflicted <HI>Case,</HI> which we may cast our <HI>Eye</HI> upon, is not <HI>our own Case</HI>! When we see any <HI>Spectacle</HI> of <HI>affliction,</HI> verily it Preaches to us, the Lessons of <HI>Thankfulness.</HI> As it was said; Luk. XIII. 2. <HI>Suppose ye, that these were sinners, above the rest, because
<PB N="25" REF="001507_0013_0fb382555b76d688"/>
they suffered such things? I tell you, No.</HI> Thus are we to argue with our selves; <Q>Must I suppose, that they who <HI>suffer</HI> these things are <HI>Greater Sinners,</HI> than I that am yet preserved from them? <HI>No,</HI> But then, O my God, <HI>What shall I render to thee?</HI> Tis thy <HI>Sovereign Grace</HI> that preserves me from these things! Oh! <HI>What shall I ren∣der to the Lord</HI>?</Q></P>
<P>But then, in the next place, we are to be <HI>Charitably</HI> Affected, <HI>Mercifully</HI> Affected. We read of such a Lovely thing, as that; Prov. XXII. 9. <HI>He that hath a Bountiful Eye shall be blessed, for he giveth of his bread to the Poor.</HI> What is a <HI>Bountiful Eye?</HI> Tis an <HI>Eye</HI> that is upon the <HI>Look-out</HI> for Subjects to Employ Bounty upon; and an <HI>Eye</HI> that <HI>affects the Heart</HI> with Dispositi∣ons to bestow the Bounty. Oh! Be rea∣dy to succour all that are under any <HI>Dif∣ficulties,</HI> any <HI>Exercises.</HI> Afford them all the <HI>Succours</HI> imaginable. My Brethren, <HI>Suffer this word of Exhortation.</HI> Enquire after such as may need your <HI>Help,</HI> any sort of <HI>Help</HI> that you can give them. Then <HI>Help</HI> them with all possible Alacrity. Take an unspeakable pleasure in <HI>Helping</HI> of
<PB N="26" REF="001507_0014_0fb38256cfbbb1d8"/>
them. Let it be the <HI>First-born</HI> of your Delights, to be Helpful unto such as want your Assistences. To Do Good Offices, Oh, Fly to it with Rapture. Never be <HI>wea∣ry of this well-doing.</HI> Tho' you meet with Monsters of Ingratitude, as I will assure you that you shall, yet be not <HI>Weary</HI>; But <HI>Overcome Evil with Good.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. Can't you <HI>See</HI>; Oh, fearful Blindness if you cannot <HI>See</HI>! — most sensible <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> of GOD, arresting many Sinners be∣fore your <HI>Eyes</HI>? These are awful <HI>Specta∣cles,</HI> and <HI>Heart-affecting</HI> ones. We read; Psal. IX. 16. <HI>The Lord is known, by the Judgments, which He Executeth.</HI> There are plain Judgments, ever now and then Executed among us. There are Sinners, as it were <HI>hang'd up in Chains,</HI> by the Judgments of God. <HI>Formidable Spectacles</HI>; But God can make them to be <HI>Profitable Spectacles.</HI></P>
<P>Don't you see Notorious <HI>Drunkards,</HI> meet with very Disastrous Events? They Live Sordidly; They Dy Wretchedly▪ The profane Proverb, that says, <HI>They get us Harm,</HI> has terrible Confutations.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001507_0014_0fb38256cfbbb1d8"/>Don't you see, That <HI>Whoremonger &amp; Adulterers God will Judge.</HI> Their Estates have a secret Curse upon them; They fall under Unaccountable Impoverishments. Their Follies not being wisely Repented, are strangely Detected; Their Names are incurably Wounded. Their Bodies too a∣non become very Hospitals of Maladies. Yea, They <HI>Dy in Youth,</HI> because their <HI>Life is among the Unclean.</HI></P>
<P>What becomes of them, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distinguish themselves as the <HI>Topping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of the Town, for Pride, Vanity, Luxury?

<P><HI>Undutiful</HI> Children, <HI>Disobedient</HI> Chil∣dren, what becomes of them? Their <HI>Days</HI> are not long in the Land.</P>

<P><PB N="28" REF="001507_0015_0fb382595158a0c8"/>And, I pray, what has been the Fate of them, who have <HI>Got Riches &amp; not by right?</HI> Men who have been <HI>False-Dealers</HI>; used a∣bundance of Under-hand Dealing; Rapa∣ciously reaching after all that could be got, Right or Wrong; Over-reaching all that they could be too Cunning for; Break∣ing their Promises; Lying in Debt unto all men, but not letting any manly in <HI>theirs</HI>; Defrauding the Hireling of his Wages; Ha∣ting to do an Honest Thing; Scarce ever doing it, but when Forced unto it. What has become of them? There has been a strange <HI>Blast</HI> from God upon them. <HI>Lo, I have seen them spreading themselves like a green Bay-tree</HI>; Yet they have <HI>passed a∣way, &amp; lo, they are not.</HI></P>
<P>I could add one thing more. There have been <HI>Knotts</HI> of Young Men, who have been Bewitched with the <HI>Gaming humour.</HI> Riots and Revels have been frequent with them.

come to Nothing! Ah, Young People; Will you not yet say, <HI>Destruction from God is a Terror to me</HI>?</P>
<P>Such Sights we have had among us. But, How should our <HI>Hearts</HI> be affected with them? Truly, so <HI>Affected</HI> as to be <HI>Cau∣tioned.</HI> Oh, Beware, Beware of the Im∣pieties, which you see Punished by God. When <HI>Corah</HI> was fearfully Swallow'd up with an Earthquake, we read; Numb. XVI. 34. <HI>All that were round about them, fled at the Cry of them; for they said, Lest the Earth swallow us up also.</HI> Verily, the Sinners whom you have seen swallow'd up, with the Scattering and Consuming Judg∣ments of God, and who have Perished from among the Congregation, make a fearful Cry in our Ears. At this Cry, Oh, Fly from their Impieties, and say, <HI>Lest the</HI> Judgments of GOD <HI>swallow us up also</HI>!</P>
<P>I now look on it, as a seasonable Dis∣charge of a Duty, to take some Notice of some Astonishing <HI>Spectacles,</HI> in the Iudgments of God upon some, whom <HI>Sa∣tan</HI> seems to have had an uncommon Pos∣session of.</P>
<P>There is a Report of some things Extra∣ordinary
<PB N="30" REF="001507_0016_0fb3825ccafbd038"/>
in some Late Judgments of God. It is likely, there may be various Misre∣presentations of many Circumstances at∣tending that matter. I will not therefore depend upon every thing that may be Re∣ported. But I suppose, no body doubts, There has been a very High Degree of Profaneness discovered by some Unhappy Men; and that God presently singled out some of them, in a manner that much A∣wakened the Neighbourhood. But whether <HI>that</HI> matter have so much in it, as has been said, or no, yet you may Remember, that a little while ago in this Town, A Poor Woman, was very much Discontented with her own Condition; but she had Recourse unto the Bottel of Rum, to quiet &amp; allay her Discontent. In that, she drowned her Soul; But with the <HI>Rum</HI> there entred <HI>Satan</HI> into her; <HI>Satan</HI> took a strange Possession of her; She imagined she must go where <HI>Satan</HI> would carry her. Tho' she were carefully shut up, such was the Efficacy of Satan, that he help'd her out of a Window, it was thought into the River; but with Circumstances that fill the Neighbourhood with Consternation. Her Carcase was af∣terwards
<PB N="31" REF="001507_0016_0fb3825ccafbd038"/>
found, where it could scarce have been imagined!</P>
<P>Several such things have occurred a∣mong us; The Judgments of God, making a <HI>Quick Dispatch</HI> of Sinners, that have grown Outragious in the Efforts of their Impiety.</P>
<P>I think, Our <HI>Heart</HI> should be <HI>affected</HI> at this rate, on such Occasions.</P>
<P>First; We ought to <HI>Bawail</HI> the scarce conceiveable <HI>Wickedness,</HI> yea, <HI>Devilism,</HI> that Mankind may sink into. When we see men Defying their Maker; Deriding all that is Venerable and Reasonable; Bur∣lesquing Religion and Eternity; Not only moved by the Instigation of <HI>Devils,</HI> but even Turned into <HI>Devils;</HI> How can we do any other than Mourn, that ever any part of Mankind should fall into such a Depravation! Alas, That any of <HI>our Race</HI> ever should be so prodigiously Depraved! <Q><HI>How art thou fallen from Heaven,</HI> O Man∣kind! Thy <HI>Throne</HI> might have been Ex∣alted among the <HI>Stars of God.</HI> Thou art brought down <HI>to Hell,</HI> to the sides of <HI>the Pit. Hell from beneath</HI> is moved for thee; The Devils there come to meet thee;
<PB N="32" REF="001507_0017_0fb3825d8f7f9720"/>
They Triumph over thee; and their Hoarse Notes upon thee are, <HI>Thou art be∣come like one of us</HI>!</Q> When the Man of God saw a <HI>Spectacle</HI> of Profanity, very short of what we have seen, he rent his Gar∣ments; he pull'd off his Hair; He sat a∣stonished; he fell down on his Knees; he Cried out, Ezr. IX. 6. <HI>O my God, I am a∣shamed, &amp; I blush to lift up my Face to thee, my God.</HI> Blessed <HI>Ezra</HI>! What wouldest thou have done, if thou hadst been in our <HI>Horrible Times</HI>!</P>
<P>Secondly; I am afraid, I am afraid, that the <HI>Language of Fiends</HI> passes too much Unpunished. Yea, that most Hellish and Roaring <HI>Blasphemies,</HI> are too patiently heard among us. It is to be fear'd, we are too Chargeable with that Error; Jer. V. 28. <HI>They overpass the deeds of the Wicked</HI>; Their nefarious Deeds are passed over, without any due Punishment inflicted on them. The <HI>Swearing,</HI> and <HI>Cursing,</HI> &amp; <HI>Blas∣pheming,</HI> that is grown to Fashionable with some <HI>Satanic</HI> People, will never be Sup∣pressed, if it be not Punished. The <HI>Ma∣gistrate</HI> cannot <HI>Punish</HI> it, if he be not <HI>In∣formed</HI> of it. Be sure, We all justly Expect,
<PB N="33" REF="001507_0017_0fb3825d8f7f9720"/>
That in his <HI>own Presence,</HI> he will never En∣dure it. But men think it hardly <HI>Honou∣rable</HI> or <HI>Charitable</HI> to be <HI>Informers</HI> against these Offendors. That is to say; If a Mortal Man or Woman in Authourity shall be Reviled, or have their Authority De∣nied, <HI>Information</HI> ought to be given. But if the Great GOD be Affronted, Abused, Vilified, and His Authority Spit upon, this must not be worthy of an <HI>Information</HI>! Ah, <HI>Zeal</HI> of Piety, When wilt thou return to the <HI>Earth,</HI> which thou hast so much <HI>For∣saken!</HI> There are <HI>Two Parties,</HI> into which the World is divided; <HI>God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Party, and <HI>Satans</HI> Party. O Sons of Indifference, which <HI>Party</HI> do you belong unto?</P>
<P>But, Sirs; You cast off <HI>Charity</HI> too! The very <HI>Charity</HI> pretended for! Did you Re∣buke the Delinquent; And on the Rebuke did he promise <HI>Amendment</HI>? In some De∣linquencies, <HI>this may go a Good way.</HI> But if it has not been so, the best <HI>Charity</HI> you can show him, is to procure him that Gentle Punishment, which the <HI>Laws</HI> have provi∣ded for him. Tis <HI>Charity,</HI> to have him thus Admonished, and Check'd, &amp; Stop'd, in his Fatal Career. God Sanctifies the
<PB N="34" REF="001507_0018_0fb3825f0f420180"/>
Strokes given by the <HI>Sword</HI> of the <HI>Ma∣gistrate.</HI> He is the <HI>Minister of God for Good,</HI> even unto <HI>Them,</HI> when he is a <HI>Terror to E∣vil-doers.</HI> If you let him go on without Controul, you Murder him; you see him running on to Perdition, &amp; you do nothing to hinder him. Where's your <HI>Charity</HI>?</P>
<P>And, Methinks, <HI>Charity</HI> to the <HI>Publick</HI> should prevail a little with you. If you knew of a man, that were going to <HI>Fire</HI> the Town, or to bring the <HI>Plague</HI> into the Town, would you give no <HI>Information</HI> of it? Verily, These Criminals are doing so. They do what they can, and it is a Great Deal that they do, to bring down <HI>Deso∣lation</HI> from the Incensed Wrath of Heaven upon the Town. The Desolations are hastened, by their being left Un-chastised. <HI>Chastisements</HI> on them, are some of the <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> which would avert and keep off the impending Wrath of Heaven. Man, Loth to be called, An <HI>Ill Neighbour</HI>; Alas, Thou art a very <HI>Bad Neighbour.</HI> All the Neighbourhood is like to fare the worse for thy Pusillanimity.</P>
<P>If all other <HI>Charity wax Cold,</HI> as I doubt it may; Yet, My Friend, A Little <HI>Charity
<PB N="35" REF="001507_0018_0fb3825f0f420180"/>
for thy self</HI> may move a little. By bearing due Testimony against such Criminals, a, <HI>Liberavi Animam,</HI> is obtained; thou <HI>deli∣verest thy own Soul,</HI> from a share in the Guilt of their Transgressions. It is an Easy and a Common Thing, for men to make the Sins of other men their own, by this; <HI>They hear them &amp; bewray them not.</HI> Because they do not what they may, to have them fairly brought to Light, and Censured, they Contract a Guilty <HI>Fellowship in the Un∣fruitful works of Darkness.</HI> It is to be Sus∣pected, very many, very many among us, have lying upon us, the <HI>Sins of Other Men,</HI> deeply to be Repented of.</P>
<P>I have one Proposal more to make; but one that I am not my self the Author of. There are beyond-Sea, many <HI>Societies for the Reformation of Manners.</HI> They have Informed against many Thousands of <HI>Swearing,</HI> and <HI>Cursing</HI> and <HI>Blaspheming</HI> Wretches; and procured a Legal Animad∣version upon them. They Publish many Discourses and Perswasives, to Encourage men in that Action of Informing. And one of their Encouragements is; <HI>A Charity to the Poor.</HI> Very much of the <HI>Fines</HI> on

the Offendors, is by the <HI>Law</HI> there, [And so tis <HI>here</HI>!] assign'd unto the <HI>Poor.</HI> There is a <HI>Charity to the Poor,</HI> in Punishing such Offendors, according to <HI>Law.</HI> I will take leave then to add this Consideration. This TOWN has in it abundance of <HI>Charity to the Poor</HI>; The Town has many Charitably-disposed People in it. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brethren, I dig open for you a New Spring of <HI>Charity.

<P>Thirdly; When, when will <HI>Riotous</HI> and <HI>Blasphemous</HI> Wretches t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke the Warnings of God? There is a Loud Voice in the <HI>Tragedy's</HI> that sometimes are seen among us; A Voice, to a Drinking and a Damning Generation. Tis that Voice; Psal.

Why shouldst thou dy before thy Time</HI>? And will you not leave off your Wickedness, till tis cut off by your <HI>dying before your Time</HI>?</P>
<P>Yea, I am to tell you, That you have seen Two Things in <HI>this World,</HI> sometimes hap∣ning to some of your Self-murdering Bre∣thren, which may give you awful Intima∣tions of what you must Expect more dread∣fully to suffer in <HI>another World.</HI></P>
<P>One thing is. You have seen them Siezed by <HI>Evil Spirits</HI>; hurried out of their Lives, by the undoubted Energy &amp; Agita∣tion of <HI>Evil Spirits.</HI> Into the Hands of such <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> will you one day be cast, by the Indignation of God. And Oh! how horribly will they handle you! <HI>Souls,</HI> You will be in the <HI>Place of Torments,</HI> when you are in the <HI>Place of Dragons.</HI></P>
<P>But None, Oh, None in such Danger of having <HI>Satan Enter</HI> into them, as those Pro∣digies, who when they have been <HI>Blas∣pheming</HI> of God, and <HI>Debauching</HI> of them∣selves, will a few Hours after Presumpte∣ously come unto the <HI>Table of the Lord.</HI> It may be fear'd, <HI>Satan</HI> will so <HI>Enter</HI> into them, that they shall anon be astonishing <HI>Specta∣cles</HI>!</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="001507_0020_0fb3826211a0f080"/>Another thing is this. You have seen the Rage and Force and Fire of a provoked <HI>Conscience</HI> in them. When Conscience has been Provoked and Awaked in them, they have been a <HI>Terror unto themselves,</HI> and unto all round about them. They have <HI>chosen Strangling rather than Life</HI>! If you go on, you must undergo the Tortures of a Conscience, which will be as a <HI>Worm that never dies,</HI> a <HI>Fire that never shall be quenched.</HI> And such a <HI>wounded Spirit,</HI> Oh, <HI>Who can bear it! Who can bear it!</HI></P>
<P>Consider these things. Let your <HI>Eye affect</HI> you <HI>Heart</HI>! After such Spectacles, Oh, <HI>Hear</HI> &amp; <HI>Fear,</HI> &amp; <HI>do no more so Wickedly</HI>!</P>

Man, Thou art thy self yet <HI>Unconverted▪</HI> if thou art not <HI>Affected</HI> with it. How dismal Spectacles was <HI>Egypt</HI> once filled withal, when there was <HI>not an House</HI> in all the Land, wherein there was <HI>not One Dead</HI>! For many Ages they kept up an Anniversary Commemo∣ration of it, with very dolorous Ejulations▪ Alas, My Friends; It may be fear'd, there
<PB N="39" REF="001507_0020_0fb3826211a0f080"/>
is hardly an House in the Town, but there is in it <HI>One Dead.</HI> In many, they are <HI>All Dead; All Dead</HI>! People not Converted unto God and Christ and Serious Piety, are, Eph.

<P>But I must bring the <HI>Spectacle</HI> a little nearer. PARENTS, Don't you see your CHILDREN yet <HI>Unconverted</HI>? Yet <HI>alie∣nated from the Life of God</HI>? Oh! How can you bear to Look upon such a <HI>Specta∣cle</HI>? A <HI>Blind</HI> Child would be a sad Specta∣cle. Thy <HI>Unconverted</HI> Child is <HI>Blind</HI>: It cannot <HI>See the things of its Everlasting Peace.</HI> A <HI>Deaf</HI> Child, would be a sad Spectacle. Thy <HI>Unconverted</HI> Child is <HI>Deaf</HI>; It cannot <HI>Hear the calls of Heaven.</HI> What a sad Spectacle were a <HI>Dumb</HI> Child? Thy <HI>Prayerless</HI> Child is a <HI>Dumb</HI> one. A Child Shrieking with the <HI>Stone,</HI> were a sad Specta∣cle; enough to break an Heart of <HI>Stone.</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="001507_0021_0fb382644fa91438"/>
There is a <HI>Stone</HI> in the Heart of thy Child, that will not be perswaded unto Religion. Yea, an <HI>Unconverted</HI> Child is one Possessed with the <HI>Devil.</HI> O Mournful, Mournful <HI>Spectacle</HI>!</P>
<P>But, how should an <HI>Heart</HI> be <HI>affected</HI> with such a <HI>Spectacle?</HI> How! Be concer∣ned, Extremely concerned, for the Salva∣tion of the <HI>Unconverted</HI> ones, and therefore for their <HI>Conversion</HI> from the <HI>Error of their Way.</HI></P>
<P>I will say this especially for that sort of <HI>Unconverted</HI> Ones; Our CHILDREN. A sad Spectacle! <HI>Children</HI> that, for ought we know, are <HI>brought forth for the Mur∣derer?</HI> Oh! What shall we do on their behalf? <HI>Parents travailing over again</HI> for them, <HI>Speak</HI> to them; and <HI>Plead</HI> with them; and <HI>Pray</HI> for them; Yea, take them Alone with you, and cause them to Kneel down by you, and make <HI>them</HI> the Witnesses of your <HI>Prayers</HI> &amp; your <HI>Tears</HI> for them. Ask for them that Blessedness; 1 Chron. XXIX. 19. Lord, <HI>Give to my Child a Perfect Heart</HI>; Oh! <HI>Travail,</HI> till you see it accomplished.</P>
<P>I no sooner turn my <HI>Eye</HI> from them, than I see another very sad Spectacle! Our
<PB N="41" REF="001507_0021_0fb382644fa91438"/>
<HI>Unconverted</HI> OLD MEN. An <HI>Old Man,</HI> just <HI>Going,</HI> but not knowing <HI>Whither</HI> he is going. An <HI>Old Man,</HI> just Entring into <HI>Heaven</HI> or <HI>Hell,</HI> but not knowing <HI>which</HI> of the Two. A very Melancholy <HI>Spectacle</HI>! O Men of God, Go to them; Talk with them; Set before them their true Interest; Make them <HI>Wise unto Salvation,</HI> if it be possible; And, Oh, Do all you can, to make these <HI>Old People,</HI> become <HI>New Crea∣tures,</HI> before they dye. Tis to be an Arti∣cle of your care; Tit. II. 2. <HI>That the Aged Men be Sober, Grave, Temperate, Sound in Faith, in Charity, in Patience.</HI></P>
<P>The Profession of those <HI>Children of Death,</HI> who have often been so <HI>Punished as our Congregation has heard,</HI> brings to my View, one <HI>sad Spectacle</HI> more; A Spectacle at which our <HI>Bowels</HI> ought to be moved Ex∣ceedingly. We have it, in our <HI>Unconver∣ted</HI> SAILORS. Poor Men; Always <HI>Asleep on the Top of a Mast!</HI> We have no <HI>Bowels</HI> in us, if we are not moved at the Spectacle. SAILORS who ought to be the <HI>Best</HI> men in the World, how <HI>Bad</HI> are very many of them! And it is now generally said, That tho' all the World knows they have had
<PB N="42" REF="001507_0022_0fb38267574cff10"/>
<HI>cause little</HI> enough, they have in the Last Ten years notoriously <HI>grown worse and worse.</HI> Ah! <HI>Evil Men!</HI> One would have scarce imagined them capable of <HI>Degeneracy</HI>: yet, they are sensibly <HI>Degenerated.</HI> Our Souls must Weep and Blood over them! They that have <HI>Understanding in the Times,</HI> apprehend, That (since we now see a <HI>Boyl on the Earth,</HI> or, a Plague raging in the Inland parts of the Old Roman Empire,) the next thing in the Prophecies to be Look'd for, is, that <HI>Second Vial</HI> of the Wrath of God; Rev. XVI. 3. <HI>Poured out upon the Sea, and it became as the Blood of a Dead Man, and every Living Soul died in the Sea.</HI> The <HI>Sea-faring</HI> part of Mankind, as well as the <HI>European</HI> Territories bordering on, or standing in, the <HI>Sea,</HI> may feel the Effects of this <HI>Vial.</HI> Ah! poor SAILORS; with what a Stupefaction on them, are they Preparing for it! Can there be no∣thing done for them? This may be done. If Religious OWNERS, would compel their <HI>Masters</HI> to uphold <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Good Orders</HI> aboard, and give them their In∣structions, and make them know, that they shall be no longer for their Service, than
<PB N="43" REF="001507_0022_0fb38267574cff10"/>
they see them Executed; This would go very far, <HI>very far,</HI> in the Matter. Sirs, Take it into your Consideration.</P>
<P N="7">VII. I ought not to break off, without Minding my Hearers, That in <HI>Comfortable Spectacles</HI> also, their <HI>Eye should affect their Heart,</HI> as well as in <HI>Miserable Spectacles.</HI> If you see <HI>Others</HI> comfortably circumstan∣ced, Oh! Let it not be with an <HI>Evil Eye,</HI> with an <HI>Envious Eye.</HI> It is a very ill Character, that Some have not only so little <HI>Grace,</HI> but so little <HI>Wit</HI> as to mani∣fest themselves under the Power of; Psal. CXII. 9, 10. <HI>A Good Man, his Horn shall be Exalted with Honour; The wicked shall see it and be grieved; he shall gnash with his Teeth &amp; melt away.</HI> But then, Look on <HI>your own</HI> Enjoyments: What Spectacles have you, in your <HI>Houses fill'd with Good Things</HI>? Your <HI>Tables,</HI> your <HI>Lodgings,</HI> your Desireable <HI>Relatives.</HI> Oh, Let your <HI>Hearts</HI> be <HI>Affected</HI> with what you <HI>See.</HI> So Affected; Psal. CIII. 1, 2. <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, &amp; all that is within me, Bless His Holy Name. Bless
<PB N="44" REF="001507_0023_0fb38268cf627618"/>
the Lord, O my Soul, &amp; Forget not all His Benefits.</HI> Go on; And Look on your <HI>Opportunities to Do Good</HI>; your Precious <HI>Opportunities.</HI> Let the Sight awaken you to Do all the Good you can for your Lives; to Spend all your Lives in the <HI>Doing of Good.</HI> Remember that Word; Prov. XIV. 22. <HI>Mercy &amp; Truth shall be to them that Devise Good.</HI> I can't break off with a Word more Worthy to be kept in Remembrance with you!</P>

<P>¶ WE have seen among our Selves more than once, the Quick Desolations, with which the Wretches, who abandon themselves to <HI>Debauchery</HI> and <HI>Profanity</HI> have been overwhelmed. I am willing to fetch over into <HI>America,</HI> some <HI>Ultra-Marine</HI> Exemples of the like Deso∣lations, upon the like Offenders; and such as have been within our own Memory, and well-attested.</P>
<P><HI>Theodorus Paludanus,</HI> a Protestant Mini∣ster in <HI>Friezland,</HI> has given us an astonishing Relation, of what happened in his Neigh∣bourhood, in <HI>June,</HI> 1681. A Mason much

He Sinn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d on; And, behold, In the midst of a Night, when he had, with one or two more in the Even∣ing Drank Three Quarts of Wine, he was found all on a Light Flame; whereof no Account could be given. He was all Burn't from Head to Foot, like an Over-roasted Fowl, and yet the Cloaths he had upon him not Sing'd at all. The Historian says, <Q>God used the Devil, as the Executioner of His Judgment, to bring the Miserable mans own Curse upon him!</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bateman</HI> assures us, That one Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rrington</HI> a Great Swearer, not Speeding in his Hunting, went into the Ale-house at <HI>Puckrych,</HI> and began to Swear, as he use to do, <HI>By Gods Blood, this is an unlucky day</HI>!

then fell a Bleeding at the Ears, Eyes, Wrists, joynts of his Body, Navel, and Fundament, in great Quantity, and with streams of Blood; and he blared out his Tongue in a fearful manner; which was as black as Pitch. Thus he continued, says my Author, <HI>Till the Devil &amp; Death made an End of him.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Abbot</HI> has Published the awful Story of Mr. <HI>William Rogers,</HI> an Apothecary; a Young Gentleman of a very agreeable Temper; but one Extremely given to <HI>Drunkenness</HI> and <HI>Sabbath-breaking.</HI> He despised the Rebukes of his Pastor, till God Struck him Sick, and he dyed of the Sick∣ness. Before he Dyed, his Horror was Wonderful. Among other horrible Ex∣pressions uttered by him, these were some; <Q>I have been a fearful Drunkard. I would now be glad if I could take the least of Gods Creatures which I have abused. Oh! that I might burn a long time in that Fire, [<HI>Pointing to the Fire before him</HI>:] So I might not burn in Hell. Be warned by me to forsake your Wicked wayes, lest you go to Hell, as I must do!</Q></P>

<HEAD>A RELATION of a Remarkable Deliverance, after a Shipwreck of Uncommon Distress, received by Captain <HI>Iohn Dean</HI> and Company. [Communicated from himself.]</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN DEAN</HI> bound from <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Ship <HI>Notingham</HI> Gally, about 120 Tuns, with 14 Men, laden chiefly with Provisions, for <HI>New-England</HI>; after we had been out above 9 Weeks we made Land to the Eastward of <HI>Piscata∣qua,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Decemb</HI> 1710 &amp; haling something Southerly for the <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> be∣twixt 8 &amp; 9 at Night, on the 11<HI>th.</HI> under a hard Gale of Wind at <HI>N. E</HI> accompanyed with Rain, Hail &amp; Snow, and a very dark Air, we run upon the East end of a Rock called <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Island</HI>; about 4 Leagues to the Eastward of <HI>Piscataqua</HI>: after two vehement Thumps upon the Rock, a third Sea hove the Ship along the side of it; the Sea running very high, and violently beating upon us, laboured the Ship so excessively, that we looked every Mo∣ment when she would fall to pieces; and the Wea∣ther so dark, that tho' we were not above 20 or 30 yards off, yet we could see nothing of the <HI>Rock:</HI> so that there appeared to us but a very small possibi∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of escaping with our lives; and we were
<PB N="51" REF="001507_0026_0fb382710f94ff98"/>
justly thrown into a consternation at the sad pros∣pect of immediately perishing in the Waters.</P>
<P>After we had spent some time in earnestly com∣mitting our selves to the Divine Mercy and Pro∣tection, we cut our Main and Fore-mast by the board, which Providentially falling to the Rock, I desired some of the Men to try, if by the help of the Masts they could recover the Shoar; and let us know their safety by their Calls to us: Two or Three of them did so; but the fierceness of the <HI>Wind,</HI> and the roaring of the <HI>Sea,</HI> perfectly drown'd their Voices, that we concluded 'em lost: How∣ever the Ship bilging, the Decks and Beams open∣ing, and all things swimming out of the hould, ob∣liged us to make the same attempt they had done before us, which thro' the wonderful goodness of God, we did with success; tho' much torn and bruised by the violence of the Sea against the Rock. When we had joyfully met those that left us, we sought for shelter to the Leeward of the Island, but found it so small, inconsiderable and scraggy a Rock that it would afford us <HI>none</HI>; nor indeed room enough to walk, to secure us from the Injuries of the Wet and Cold.</P>
<P>When the Day appeared, it presented us with a dismal Spectacle, a doleful little Spot in the Sea, of about an Hundred yards square, with only some ruins of our last Nights Shipwrack cast up, or dash∣ing against it; and a Miserable number of us with∣out Food or Shelter; saving some small pieces of <HI>Cheese,</HI> we pick'd from among the Sea-weed, and some old Canvas we spread on the Craggs of the Rock to stow under at Night: part of our yards came a shoar, with our Cables and some Junk
<PB N="52" REF="001507_0027_0fb3827292dc9918"/>
conger'd about them, and our Anchor so Weighed by 'em, that a send of the Sea would shew it above Water; and some part of the Stern, with several pieces of Plank and Timber.</P>
<P>The next Morning, (13<HI>th</HI>) One <HI>Martin Downs</HI> our Cook dyed; and the best burial we could give him was to lay him where the Sea would carry him away: The rest of our Men were generally so ill and bruised, that but 4 or 5 of us were able to at∣tempt any thing for our safety. This day finding some more Plank and Canvas sent us a shoar, we built a sort of a Tent, where we hous'd our selves from the Wind and Weather.</P>
<P>The 14<HI>th.</HI> after having Sang a <HI>Psalm,</HI> and been at <HI>Prayers,</HI> (which devotion we observed every Morning &amp; Evening,) we attempted to get Fire, by rubbing the dryest Sticks of Firr we could get together; which proving ineffectual, we made a sort of a Drill, whose motion was more violent, but our Wood was so water-soaken, that we laboured in vain: and were extreamly pinch'd with the Cold for want of it, insomuch that our Feet swell'd, and many of them were nip'd with the Frost: This e∣vening therefore I cut off my Boots, and desired the Men to get their Shoes off, but so frost-bitten and blister'd were some of their Legs, that in pul∣ling off their Stockings, they fley'd off skin and all; and some of the Nails of their Feet: which we wrap'd up as warm as we could in O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um &amp; Canvas. This Day the Sea flowing high came into our Tent, and carry'd away part of it; that we were necessita∣ted to remove it to the highest Craggs of the Rock.</P>
<P>From about this time, (for I can't remember ex∣actly the Day of every occurrence) as often as the
<PB N="53" REF="001507_0027_0fb3827292dc9918"/>
Weather would permit, we hoisted a Staff &amp; white <HI>Flag</HI> upon our Tent, in hopes that some Vessel pas∣sing by might discover it. And now the Mercy of God sent us a shoar three small Cheeses, which at the desire of the Company, I dealt forth daily to every man an equal allowance of.</P>
<P>We began now to build a flat bottom'd float of the Plank &amp; Timber, laying three Plank's width for the bottom, and two up side, with some Can∣vas like a wast cloth upon that, to keep the Sea out the better; but so few hands were able to work, and our Carpenter rarely affording his assistance, because of his illness, it was about the 20<HI>th.</HI> ere we had finished it; and the 21<HI>st.</HI> proving moderate Weather, it was agreed that my Mate, with 4 or 5 of the Men with me, should endeavour to recover the Main, and send a Vessel for the rest.</P>
<P>Accordingly, with much ado, we got it down to the Water side, having first Commended our selves and our enterprize to the blessing of God by earnest Prayer; about Noon we lanched the float, being necessitated to wade deep into the Water to ac∣complish it; but the rowling Surff soon threw us a∣long shoar, and over-set us; and it was a great Mercy that we escaped drowning, so feeble were we and unable to help our selves: The Boat pre∣sently stove against the Rock, and tho' our enter∣prize was dash'd, and our hopes baulkt, and the loss of our Ax &amp; Hammer, with the Boat, was great, yet we could not but see the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God in the midst of <HI>Judgment,</HI> for in the afternoon, the Wind sprang up and blew hard, that had we been at Sea in that <HI>imitation of a Boat,</HI> in all probability we had perished; and those we were to have left behind
<PB N="54" REF="001507_0028_0fb38274d08d9c20"/>
would have fared no better because unable to help themselves: Thus our <HI>Disappointment</HI> (thro' the goodness of God) proved our <HI>Safety.</HI></P>
<P>We were now brought into very Miserable &amp; Me∣lancholy circumstances; the men extream Weak, their Feet frozen, with deep Ulcers in their Legs; the very smell of them offensive to those of us that could go into the Air, and nothing to dress them with but a piece of linnen that was hove up; our small stock of Cheese spent, and nothing left us to support Nature but a few <HI>Mussels,</HI> scarce, and hard to get, and the <HI>Sea-weed</HI> that grew upon the Rock; we had now the black prospect of <HI>Starving,</HI> while our Limbs perished by piece meals; and we were under the afflicting apprehensions lest the <HI>Spring Tide,</HI> at the approaching Full Moon, should be ac∣company'd with a high Wind and quite over-flow us; besides the aggravating Affliction that all the Vessels we saw pass at a distance, took no no∣tice of our Signal; That we were ready to lye down in despair, and the most of us not so much as hop'd for deliverance: Tho' I endeavoured to en∣courage them and my self to put our Trust in God, and patiently <HI>Wait for his Salvation</HI>; and I look'd upon it as a great favour, in this Distress, that the Mate struck down a <HI>Sea Gull,</HI> which we got and thankfully fed upon.</P>
<P>The last method of safety we could engage in was to make a <HI>Raft</HI> that would carry Two Men; but the labour of clearing the Fore yard, of which it was chiefly to be made, from the Cable &amp; Junk, was so great, and our <HI>Hands</HI> so few &amp; weak, that it was about the 24<HI>th.</HI> ere we had finished it; which proving a moderate Day, with a fine Sea-brieze, we
<PB N="55" REF="001507_0028_0fb38274d08d9c20"/>
got it down to the Water, and after having made our Supplications to Heaven for Success, two of the men, who were more especially desirous of ventu∣ring, were launched upon it, about two in the Af∣ternoon; but the swell rowling high over set it, as it had done our Boat; and tho' one of the men (an English man that could not swim) refused a second attempt, yet the other (a <HI>Swede,</HI> whose Feet were so frozen that he was forced to crawl upon his hands &amp; knees to the Water-side) continued resolute to attempt the shoar, tho' he should go alone; another of our men encouraged by his resolution undertook to bear him company: after they had put off from us, they desired me to go to Prayer for them &amp; watch what became of them; I did so; and by that time the evening came on, I tho't they might be half way a-shoar; &amp; the Wind blowing hard about 9 or 10 at night, at <HI>S. E.</HI> I concluded they might reach the shoar by 2 in the Morning; but it seems they fell in with some breakers, or the violence of the Sea over∣set them, &amp; they perished; for a day or two after, the Raft was found cast up, with one man dead, some distance from it. We, upon the <HI>desolate Island</HI> not knowing what ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> befallen them, waited daily for deliverance; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur expectations were confirm'd by the smoak we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw in the Woods two days after they left us; which was the signal I desired them to make, if they arrived safe; and we look'd upon their delay as occasioned by not being able to procure a Vessel so soon as we desired. And this hope under God was all we had to support us.</P>
<P>About the latter end of this Month, the <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who had been ill ever since his coming a-shoar, and now having his Feet frozen, an excessive pain in his
<PB N="56" REF="001507_0029_0fb382764f75bbb0"/>
back, and such a stiffness in his Neck, that he could not stir his head, and almost choaked with Phlegm, to our apprehension drew near his End; towards evening we raisied his head, and I Prayed over him; he shew'd himself <HI>Sensible,</HI> but was <HI>Speechless</HI>; about Midnight I enquired of them that lay next him, who told me, he was dead.</P>
<P>The next Day presented me with the most Me∣lancholy view of the effects of <HI>Hunger</HI>; for our starving Company, who had now been for several Days without any sustenance, but Sea weed and 2 or 3 <HI>Mussels</HI> a day, desiring of me that they might have <HI>his Body</HI> to support their Lives with: This, of all I had met with, was the most shocking to me; to see us drove to such necessity as to eat what seemed to contrary to Nature: I begg'd of God that He would find out some way for our support, without feeding upon our <HI>Dead Companion</HI>; but all other means failing, and the Men incessantly cal∣ling upon me for it, I was forced to give my con∣sent; and their own feebleness necessitated me, upon their request, to prepare it for them the best manner I could, that they might not all perish with hunger. I gave them some of it that Night; and the next day suffered them to Eat what they would of it; but finding some very ravenous, I was forced to keep watch over it, and let them have only their daily Portion; least, ere we obtain'd our delive∣rance, this should be spent, and we be obliged to feed upon the <HI>Living.</HI></P>
<P>It having pleased God, in Mercy to us, to put it into the hearts of some People, where the Raft was cast a shoar, to come upon the search; the sight of a Vessel on the Morning of the 2<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>January</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="001507_0029_0fb382764f75bbb0"/>
half way from the shoar, standing directly for us, made our hearts leap within us: When they came within Call, I desired them to vere a Buoy to me, and I would fasten my self to the End of the Rope, and they should hale me on board; (for the swell would not suffer them to venture to the Rock) but expecting smoother Water, they hovered about the Island till Noon; when I told them we were perishing for want of <HI>Fire,</HI> which we had been without all this cold season; at length one of the Men came a-shoar in his small Canoo, and gave us the refreshment of a <HI>Fire</HI>; I thought to have gone on board with him, but the rowling Surff over-set the Canoo, and I was glad to tarry to dry my self; and the Man, after waiting for a favourable snatch, till near Sun set, was forced to go without me, the Canoo not being able to carry us both in such a swell.</P>
<P>It was an uncomfortable sight to see the Shallop stand away for the shoar without us: but that Night proving stormy Weather, our Good Friends lost their <HI>Vessel,</HI> tho' they Saved their <HI>Lives</HI>; but had <HI>we</HI> been with them, our feebleness would hardly have suffered us to have escaped: So that still the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God is to be seen in our <HI>Disappointment.</HI></P>
<P>Upon their arrival, they sent an express to <HI>Ports∣mouth</HI> in <HI>Piscataqua</HI>; but the next day continuing very bad Weather, was a great addition to our sorrows, and tryal of our Patience. Tho' we were satisfyed the People a-shoar knew of our miserable Condition, yet our flesh now failing, and no drink all this while but the brackish Water in the Crags of the Rock, and our Tent rendred uncomfortable by the blinding Smoak, and the Weather such as
<PB N="58" REF="001507_0030_0fb3827bacf55a88"/>
we knew none could come to our assistance while it lasted, made our hearts to fail within us; and the <HI>near prospect</HI> we had had of deliverance, gave us but so much the more uneasiness at the <HI>delayes</HI> of it.</P>
<P>But it pleased God that in the Night the Wind abated, and by Sun rise the 4<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> we had a Shallop come for us, with Captain <HI>Long,</HI> and Captain <HI>Furbur,</HI> who were very brisk in getting us on board, and kind in their treatment of us. That Night about 8 a clock we arrived at <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> where we were very civilly received, and the kind People there made a Collection for the relief of my men: and tho' my Boy neglecting to pull off his Shoes, as I ordered, had his Feet so swoln and black that I never expected he would have the use of them again, was forced the next day to have half of one of his Feet taken off, yet thro' the won∣derful Mercy of God, he and all the Men are in a likely way of recovery: My own Health and Stength by the distinguishing Goodness of God, having been continued to me the whole of our Twenty four Dayes Misery, beyond Expectation.</P>

<P>AN <HI>Affecting</HI> Story! And capable of being improved unto many Purposes of Piety! MARINERS, <HI>You</HI> above all men will take it into your Consideration. Of the Men rescued from the Evil circumstances of <HI>Boone-Island,</HI> I know, you think▪ <HI>They ought to be very
<PB N="59" REF="001507_0030_0fb3827bacf55a88"/>
Thankful unto God for their Preservations</HI>! But, I Pray, what ought You to be for <HI>Yours</HI>? Though you have not been in Distresses e∣qual unto <HI>Theirs,</HI> yet you have seen your <HI>Dis∣tresses,</HI> and your <HI>Deliverances.</HI> Or, if you have never been at all Remarkably Distressed, even in this very thing the more signal your <HI>Pre∣servations!</HI> When will you sit down and Pon∣der, <HI>What shall I render to the Lord for all His Be∣nefits?</HI> And Resolve, <HI>Lord, I owe myself unto Thee, and I will be Thine for ever more!</HI> Were you in favour with God, What a <HI>Friend</HI> would you have! A <HI>Friend</HI> who can rescue you in the Worst &amp; Last Extremites; A <HI>Friend,</HI> who can do for you, when all other Help fails you; A <HI>Friend</HI> who can turn your very <HI>Disasters</HI> into <HI>Benefits.</HI> If you will continue in ill Terms with Heaven, you run the Danger of being, how dreadfully dealt withal! Ah <HI>Lord, who Knows the Power of thine Anger</HI>! The Great GOD, You see, can Pursue you with His <HI>Horrible Tempest.</HI> He can <HI>Starve</HI> you to Death, in a Ship Laden with <HI>Provision!</HI> He can Sink the Strongest Vessel in the Ocean. He can show you the Land of your Desires &amp; yet hold you uncapable of reaching it. Yea, He can <HI>Burn</HI> you, in the midst of the <HI>Water</HI>! The <HI>Scourges</HI> of Sin, the <HI>Arrows</HI> of Death, in the Hands of His Vengeance are Numberless; He can make your <HI>Plagues Wonderful.</HI> What is worse

than all this; He can smite you with <HI>Spiritu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Plagues,</HI> and give you up to such <HI>Blindness</HI> of Mind, and such <HI>Hardness</HI> of Heart, and such a <HI>Possession</HI> of Satan, that you shall be desperately Impenitent in the very Jaws of Death, and utter the Language of Fiends in your last Breath, and just as you are Expiring into the Arms of the Fiends. I can tell of some that have done so; Perhaps without making much <HI>Digressi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> from what we have been upon. And unto what yet more amazing Punish∣ments, will many, many find themselves ob∣noxious, when the <HI>Sea shall give up its Dead</HI>! Oh! That upon the Consideration of these things, our <HI>Mariners</HI> would come into a <HI>Right Mind!</HI> And come into such Purposes as these.</P>
<P><HI>O Great GOD, I Mourn for the Sins of my Heart and Life! Oh; Let thy Grace cause me to Mourn with a true Repentance. I Pray, That my Sins may be all Pardoned thro' the Blood of my Saviour; and I now put my self under the Com∣mand and Guidance of that Lovely Saviour. I desire, that from this Time, I may hate and shun every wicked Thing, and that I may every Day call upon thy Name, and that I may have all my Wayes governed by the Rules of Serious Piety. Lord, I am Thine; Save me, Save me to the Uttermost!</HI></P>
