<P>THE general design is already known. But, as the pulpit is rather in dept to little Children, my particular design is to preach to them. I have often thought of taking this method, to impress their tender minds with the importance of early duty, in consequence of seeing them so atten∣tive to instruction, when distinguished by a particular address: and, as often have been afraid of the attempt, left I should not treat things according to their capacities, without being too free with the public rights of others. Their little opening minds are capa∣ble of receiving some of the most im∣portant truths of the gospel when they are easily connected, and plainly ex∣pressed. And, though I cannot claim that tenderness, and instructive skill that are equal to the subject, yet I am
<PB REF="018195_0003_0FA5C02C020BE148"/>
induced to address them in this public manner, because I hope the divine blessing will succeed my intention, in answer to the unwearied prayers of christians for their salvation. My hopes of some measure of success, are also strengthened from this considerati∣on, that all faithful persons who love to form the minds of little children for Christ, and give them to him with nurturing hands, will gratefully improve their advantages, in every department, to extend, and widen these instructions, and add a lasting influence to them, with line upon line, and precept upon precept, repeatedly, and continually.</P>
<P>The method will contain two gene∣ral branches: in the first place, I shall shew children, what it is to obey their parents in the Lord: and secondly in what respect, it is right or beautiful. And as the principal design, is to give instruction to little children, I take it for granted, the candid, improved mind will chuse to hear them addressed, in their own plain, and familiar style: we shall therefore indulge freedom of thought, and simplicity of expression.</P>
<P>And now, my dear children, since the sermon is to be preached to you, I ask your diligent and careful attention
<PB N="5" REF="018195_0004_0FA5C02CCB881E30"/>
to it. I hope you will remember this is the Lord's day—that yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the house of God—and that he is now pre∣sent to observe your conduct, and take notice of all your thoughts. I hope you will also remember that it is not the word of man, but of the Lord, that is now to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be delivered to you▪ and therefore that he calls upon you to take heed how you hear. Christ now speaks in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s manner; "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle children keep yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves from idols," and give me your hearts. Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e them this moment, that you ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obey your parents in the Lord. And you will not act like wise and good children, to expect a better opportunity. You have no right to promise yourselves another sabb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th; for eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to-morrow, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the next mo∣ment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not yours. And, before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he next sabbath you may not only be ta∣ken sick, but taken away; and your tende bodies covered up in the cold and si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v, where they will return to dust, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd not be seen any more till the last day; and your souls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a vast eternity! Listen then now, with all your hearts, to the voice of Christ, that you may be ready for an early death. You m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st not play, nor sleep nor indulge a thoughtless, wandering
<PB N="6" REF="018195_0005_0FA5C02E526C3B78"/>
mind, like many others, older than you, who ought to set better examples. But, you must worship God in spirit, and in truth, and love his word with all the heart; and then Christ will love you, as the tender lambs of his flock.</P>
<P>IN the first branch of discourse, I am to shew you, what it is, to obey your parents in the Lord. And, to make it easy for you to understand. I will mention six things, which belong to the wicked class of children, that you must not indulge, if you intend to be dutiful.</P>
<P>First, To be dutiful children, you must not indulge a careless disposition, respecting the directions of your pa∣rents. For the careless temper is one cause of disobedience. And, if you have a great deal of this temper, you will have the more disobedience. Care∣less children treat the directions of their parents, as though not worthy of any notice. Even while in company with them, they often hear without at∣tention &amp; consequently, without any more obedience to their directions, than to the blowing of the wind. And when they happen to be at a little distance, not only let them call a number of times, without giving an answer; at all
<PB N="7" REF="018195_0006_0FA5C02F01558998"/>
And what is this but disobedience? What is it better than obedience to satan? For, he persuades them not to answer, that he may learn them, not only to deceive, but to tell lies also. And hence it comes to pass, when the parents have called with weariness, without receiving any answer from the child, and they enquire whether he did not hear, he has NO for an answer as quick as he can speak. And when this is done, satan feels highly pleased, for he has not only learned him to be care∣less and deceitful, but to cover all over with a LYE. And this is satan's me∣thod with children▪ he learns them one thing after another, till they be∣come so acquainted with sin, as to get by heart the most wicked lesson he teaches. And, as soon as he prevails with children to be careless, he finds it easy to learn them to be forgetful, to de∣ceive, and lye, and almost every thing he pleases in a short time. You must not then indulge a careless disposition▪ For the careless child is the undutiful one.</P>
<P>Secondly, You must not indulge idle∣ness. For the idle spirit is unfriendly to obedience. The idle child cannot therefore be a dutiful one. And, idle∣ness
<PB N="8" REF="018195_0007_0FA5C02FD8BF6360"/>
is not only a bad thing in itself, but is the cause of a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n any more. For when satan finds an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e child, he will soon have something for him to do that is very wicked. He has a great deal of business, for id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e children to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndertake; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y are such fool∣ish, wicked little creatures, that they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ways love to do as he bid them, a thousand times better than to obey their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents. There are many chil∣dren, who obey satan steadily all day long, and hate with all their hearts to be obedient in the Lord. They love to escape the sight of duty, and to keep at the greatest distance from it: And, therefore, when a chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of this temper reads the bible, his catechism, or what∣ever, his heart is still in love with idle∣ness. He does not love to see the sab∣bath▪ if his parents keep it in a strict, and holy manner, because he takes no pleasure in duty: But, if his parents disregard the sabbath, and make it a day of idleness, instead of holy resting, then he loves to see it, for a play-day. He is very diligent at play, but has no diligence in duty. When, there∣fore he is directed to do an errand, it seems as though idleness, and slothful∣ness together, would not let him move
<PB N="9" REF="018195_0008_0FA5C03078DF2C70"/>
a single step; but as soon as he sees an opportunity to slide into play with disobedient children, he is all life, and spirit, and goes as fast as he can run. And, this is the child that is so unfaith∣ful, as soon as he escapes the sight of his parents. He not only neglects to do as he is directed, but stays a great while, though charged to return im∣mediately; and frequently very much disturbs the business of the family for some time. He acts as though he could not obey his parents too little, and satan too much. In short, the idle creature is always in satan's path, and the devil cannot go a along without seeing him, or stumbling upon him. But, how foolish is it, for a child to go, &amp; wait for the devil to come along, to give him wicked thoughts, and tell him what to do next? How foolish, did I say? Rather, how very wicked? How dishonorable to God, who hath made him to love, and obey his parents in the most dutiful manner? And how de∣structive to his own soul? and when children will indulge the idle dispositi∣on &amp; throw themselves in satan's way, they have nothing to expect, but God will give them up entirely, and let him lead them where he pleases, till he
<PB N="10" REF="018195_0009_0FA5C03142F85488"/>
leads them blind, right down to hell. Take care then, children, and with∣draw your feet from the path of idleness for it leads directly to destruction. I hope you will remember, that idleness was one of the great sins of Sodom, for which so many people were de∣stroyed with fire from heaven. And remember Lot's wife also, who became a pillar of salt, because she was so idle, as to look back, when God told her to make haste, and escape for her life, lest she should perish with the rest of the people. You must not then stand all the day idle, with the wicked, but for∣sake idleness, and love diligence, or you cannot be dutiful children. But,</P>
<P>Thirdly, If you intend to obey your parents in the Lord, you must not in∣dulge the spirit of anger. For "Anger resteth in the bosom of fools." And, fire, you not only resemblethe the an∣gry revengeful man, whose tongue and eyes are full of poison and spite, but the little malicious devils themselves. You must therefore put away anger, and wrath, and every thing of that nature: for the dutiful child is as gentle, and meek as a lamb. He has the spirit of Christ, and does not love to be fretful, and peevish. And nothing alarms him

<PB N="12" REF="018195_0011_0FA5C03378C79948"/>
no humility in their hearts till they are made new creatures, there is no∣thing more common, than for them to obey their parents with his tem∣per. And this is the spirit, when they obey their parents only for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sake of being thought better than others. Their hearts are so proud, and vain▪ as to be delighted with empty praise. And they will often attend to the com∣mands of their parents, for the sake of gratifying the pride and vanity of their hearts, when nothing else is sufficient to move them. But, this is poor obedi∣ence indeed, because it is performed in pride, instead of humility:—And, little children will never appear beautiful, in the sight of God, whose eye is fixed on the heart, till they are as humble as the dust. As they are taken from the dust, they can only please God, when they feel humble, and little, and love to do their duty for the sake of the holy pleasure they enjoy in it. And when this humble temper prevails, like little diligent bees, which fly from one low flower to another, to collect the richest honey, wherever they can find it, so humble little chidren will love to go from thing to thing, where they can serve God the most, and enjoy him
<PB N="13" REF="018195_0012_0FA5C03445117858"/>
the best. Vain worthless praise is very lightly esteemed; and the lovely exam∣ple of the little Jesus will be their de∣light:—When Christ was a child, he loved to obey his parents, not for the sake of idle praise, but because he loved his duty.—Duty was his delight— and therefore he conducted in such a lovely inoffensive manner, with so much wisdom, and propriety, that as he in∣creased in stature, or grew up, he in∣creased in favour with God, and man. He was loved by all, who loved the beauties of holiness, and received the most lasting praises of the dutiful spi∣rit. Here is an example for little chil∣dren that will never fade away, but grow brighter and brighter: And you must forsake pride, and follow this example, if you intend to be dutiful children, and worthy of true praise, But,</P>
<P>Fifthly, If you intend to be dutiful children, you must not indulge selfish∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss. For after all the soft, and pretty names which satan hath given it to deceive the world, it is the substance of all iniquity. And as the selfish man, who appears to be a christian, only be∣cause he intends to be happy forever, cannot be one, so the child who obeys
<PB N="14" REF="018195_0013_0FA5C03505ABBC88"/>
his parents, only to obtain rich clothes and fine things, cannot be dutiful. For, when a child is governed by this spirit, it is not his parents he loves, but the fine things he intends to obtain from them. And, hence this kind of obedience never lasts longer than the prospect of private rewards. It always looks for pay, just like the obedience of the Jews. When Christ came into the world, and manifested his almighty power,—in so many miracles,—they were very agreeably struck with him indeed:—For a little time, they ap∣peared to love him exceedingly, and were so fond of obeying, that they intended to have made him King. But what may we suppose, was the cause of so much love and respect? Were they in love with his true character, or something else?—I will tell you, chil∣dren, if you will attend:—They were in love with themselves only, in the gratification of their unlawful desires. They were in love with sin, and lov∣ed Christ only as the kingly servant of their pleasures:—They loved them∣selves the most, and Christ only to defend them from their enemies, and increase their worldly grandeur. And if he had done according to their sel∣fish
<PB N="15" REF="018195_0014_0FA5C035D4A2C2B8"/>
desires, they would have loved him extremely, no doubt. But this was impossible, because he came to destroy the kingdom of satan, instead of buil∣ding it up —Therefore, as soon as he reproved them for their selfishness, and told them to give away their riches to the poor, and take up the cross, and follow him in a holy manner, they were highly offended:—And not only so, but told the basest lies about him they could invent. —and did every thing possible to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in his character; and make every body hate him:— But this was not all, for when he, in the most friendly loving manner, warned them of the danger of their selfishness, it so fired their hearts with hatred, and malice, that they put him to death without pity or tears. They shed the blood of God (for Christ was God) only because he would not indulge them in sin. O, ungreatful man! What hast thou done! For Christ came into the world to save thee from hell, and give thee heaven, and when dying on the cross, prayed for thy salvation! And what have you done, my children, or rather, what are you doing still, who do not love Christ with all your hearts? But, let us not lose sight of the Jews.
<PB N="16" REF="018195_0015_0FA5C036F0CE9930"/>
What was all that love and obedience good for▪ which they shewed Christ, when they intended to have put a crown upon his head, and treated him as King? It was good for nothing, because selfish:—And so all selfish obe∣dience will change itself instantly into the most bitter spite and malice, when denied the thing it lusts after. This is the natural picture of selfish religion, And, I have given you this instance, to shew that all the selfish obedience of children to their parents, is of no value in the sight of God. There are many children, who appear to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e their parents, and obey them, and yet have no more true obedience than the Jews had to Christ. And I believe there are not a few who have had very wrong feelings toward their parents, when they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve been denied the things they choose. And let me tell you, that as far as you have, any of you had such hearts-risings, in case of a proper de∣nial▪ that you resemble those wicked creatures, who put Christ to death be∣cause he would not uphold and indulge t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em in sin: But if you were not sel∣fish, you would have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of these feel∣ings: And instead of displeasure to∣ward your kind pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents, when they re∣fuse to grant your unreasonable request,
<PB N="17" REF="018195_0016_0FA5C03756AE4640"/>
you would think them the best judges of yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r wants, and rest easy and con∣tented. But as long as you have the selfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h disposition, you will feel more or lese of the uneasy, resentful spirit, even when denied things which would be your ruin, just as wicked men feel angry with providence, when things do not answer their desires and ex∣pectations. It is selfishness that makes children desire, and ask for things not proper for them to have; and resentful when denied: It makes you uneasy with the things you have, and fretful that you have not more: It is this that makes so much uneasiness with the conduct of parents, which is fol∣lowed with so much disobedience: It makes you so covetous, and loth to give, as your parents direct you, to poor little children, who have nothing but poverty, and rags:—It is selfishness that prevents your doing as you would be done by. In short, it is the founda∣tion of disobedience, and as far as you are selfish, you cannot be dutiful chil∣dren. It will always be in the way; And you must not indulge it.</P>
<P>Sixthly▪ To be dutiful children, you must not be more afraid of correction than you are of faults. For, to be
<PB N="18" REF="018195_0017_0FA5C0380F675C00"/>
more afraid of correction, than of faults is to love one's self more than the com∣mand and honour of God, which can∣not be right. But there is a great deal of obedience, such as it is, that is wholly indebted to the fear of correc∣tion, and nothing else: And, hence the undutiful child, will often do as he is directed, when at the same time, if not afraid of correction, would pay no sort of attention to the matter. But the du∣tiful child is as much afraid of faults as of correction: And more too, I believe we may say, as far as the dutiful dispo∣sition prevails: For he loves God with all his heart. And no reason can be gi∣ven why a person, where things are wise∣ly regulated, should be afraid of unde∣served punishment, for God does not allow the offender to be punished more than he deserves: —And when parents, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any others, punish a child more than the offence deserves, they offend God. But, I will tell you how the undutiful child will conduct, who is afraid of cor∣rection, and not of faulte: —He will go to school wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n directed, and not play the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uant, lest he should be corrected; when at the same time, if not afraid of correction, he would spend his whole time at play, and not go into school
<PB N="19" REF="018195_0018_0FA5C038DCC41708"/>
at all:—He is only afraid of punish∣ment▪ if he does wrong▪ but the wicked creature is not afraid of doing wrong. And from the same sla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish fear, some very wicked men▪ when so dan∣gerously sick as to think they shall die, and go to hell, will be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of tears and distress, and make the most solemn promises, if God will spare their lives, and give them health, that they will amend their ways, and keep all his commands: —But yet when to all ap∣pearance they lie at the point of death, will not love God. And hence, as soon as God removes the danger of the sick∣ness in some measure, and they grow a little better, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll instantly swear and curse as prosanely as ever: The reason is this, they are not afraid of sinning, and are only afraid of punishment. I will give you another instance of the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re. When there comes up a most terrib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e storm at sea, and if thun∣ders and lighten▪ as though all nature would s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lit to pieces, and burn up, and the ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is so tossed and hurried about by the angry wind and waves, that the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew expect to go inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntly to the bottom, then the most hard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ed wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches, who never prayed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their lives, will cry cut in their dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> —
<PB N="20" REF="018195_0019_0FA5C0399241EF58"/>
"Lord have mercy on us," as loud as they can scream, "Lord save our poor sinking souls," But what will they say as soon as the storm abates, and their danger is a little over? I dare not tell you, my children, it is so wicked;—I can only say thus far; they will the very next breath be at a loss for oa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hs profane enough to use on the occasion, when God just preserved them from sinking, not only into the sea, but to the bottom of hell.—You therefore see, they do not cry to God for help, because they love his holy mercy, but only because they are afraid of hell.— And why do they not cry to be saved from sin, as well as from punishment? Because they are only afraid of punish∣ment, and not of sin at all:—They are not afraid of offending God; and if he did not sometimes shew a little of the power of his vengence, they would not be afraid of any thing. They would neither fear God, nor regard man, in any sense whatever. And if such har∣dened creatures do not soon repent, God, in his mighty wrath, will bring them into greater danger still, and make them feel what they now, at times, only fear; and will laugh at their calamities, and mock when their
<PB N="21" REF="018195_0020_0FA5C03C0271B3B0"/>
fear cometh, when fear cometh as de∣solation, and destruction as a whirl∣wind, when distress and anguish com∣eth upon them—God is very merci∣ful, but he does not regard the cries of those who are in love with sin, and are only afraid of danger, any more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrist regarded the prayer of satan, when he cried so earnestly, not to be tormented before the time. And as God does not love such wicked crea∣tures, because they call for help in distress, when, at the same time, they hate his mercy with all the heart, and are only afraid of punishment; neither does he love children who obey their parents, on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y because they are afraid of correction:—For when correction is the only ground of obedience, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nothing but forced obedience, and con∣sequently no obedience at all. And as God hath not commanded forced obedience▪ he will not accept of it now, nor will he accept of it at the great day. You then see, that to be dutiful children, you must be princi∣pally afraid of faults. As a poor man, who stands in great need of a little money and is so honest that he will not steal it, though he has opportunity, because stealing is forbiden by God;
<PB N="22" REF="018195_0021_0FA5C03C838AD470"/>
so you should be afraid of every act of disobedience, because he hath forbiden it. And further, when you remember that you are not able, even by eternal suffering▪ to pay any part of the debt you owe God, for past disobedience, let the value of your own souls, and the honour of God, and shall I n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say, the blood of Christ, engage you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearts to be afraid of sin. Fear sin, because it is the enemy of God, and all good: And then you will be dutiful, because obedience is delightful. You will be the children of wisdom, who eat honey because it is good, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the honey-comb because it's pleasant to the taste. I HAVE to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> six things, to remember; but not to indulge.</P>

<P>CHILDREN, obey your PARENT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the <HI>LORD</HI>: For this is right.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I WILL now endeavour to shew you, what dispositions belong to the dutiful class of children. And, let me observe, that the great thing is a new heart. This sums up all the rest. The new heart contains all the lovely dis∣positions that make the dutiful child. And, one new heart is of more value, than all the world full of silver and gold. Therefore, God, who knows the value of things, says,
<Q>My son, give me thy heart.</Q>
An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when a little child gives God his heart, then he will obey his parents in the Lord, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not before. For all children have wicked hearts when they are BORN: And that makes them so wicked, when they grow up into life. Even little infants, that appear so innocent and pretty, are God's little enemies at
<PB N="24" REF="018195_0023_0FA5C03EF6B1A1F8"/>
heart: For they were shapen in ini∣quity, and conceived in sin. Their hearts are full of nothing but enmity to God. As a young serpent has the nature of old one, so the little infant▪ has the nature of a wicked man in his heart. And the hearts of old me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ and young men, and babes must all be new, or they will not be saved▪ there∣fore Christ says, "Except a man be born again; he "cannot see the king∣dom of God."—You then see, that the new heart is the principal thing.</P>
<P>AND, now I will mention six things that belong to the new heart, and you must have them all, or you will not obey your parents in the Lord.</P>
<P>First, You must love all the com∣mandments, For if you are not pleased with the entensive nature of God's law, you will not love the fifth command, which is▪ "Honour thy father and mother."—The fifth commandment and the text, contain one and the same thing. And certainly you must love this, or you will not be dutiful. But if you love the fifth, you will all the rest; for they hang together, and make but one thing, which is love.— Therefore the scripture says,
<Q>Love is the fulfilling o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the law.</Q>
But, to
<PB N="25" REF="018195_0024_0FA5C03F8FB97B70"/>
make it easy for you to see the necessity of loving the commandments to be du∣tiful, let me ask: How can you be truly obedient, when directed by your parents, not to take God's holy name in vain, and not to use any wicked words, if you do not love the third commandment? You remember it is this—"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain"—And, how can you be obedient in the Lord i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you do not love the Lord's com∣mandments? While I am speak∣ing of this commandment, it can∣not be amiss to tell you, that the breach of it, is not only a great vice, but a growing one. How often do you hear men swear and curse and damn each other to hell as though they just came up with their tongues red hot from the fire of damnation! And, how often do you hear little chil∣dren who just begin to run about street, speak the language of hell plainer than any other? I doubt, my children, that you hear more of the language of hell than you do of heaven. And the rea∣son is this, people do not love the third commandment. See to it then, that you do not act like others, but love it. But, to pass on: How can
<PB N="26" REF="018195_0025_0FA5C04077571958"/>
you be dutiful children in the obser∣vance of the sabbath, when you are told by your parents to be good chil∣dren, not to play, but attend to all the duties of it both at home and at meeting, if you do not love the fourth commandment? But as soon as you love the commandment, you will love to read the bible, and all other good books; the sabbath will be your de∣light, and all the branches of duty which belong to it will be your plea∣sure. For the proper direction of your parents is the commanding voice of God▪ that points out your duty. It is just as though you heard him speak to you, as plainly as you hear it thunder. For, he instructs them that they may instruct you.—And they are inexcusa∣ble if you are not instructed properly. Now then as the voice of parents, is the voice of God, you easily see you must love the commandments of God, or you will not obey your parents in the Lord. Instead of following the example of those wicked children who saw Christ when on earth and heard him speak, and yet were not obedient, you must obey him now, in loving all the directions of your parent. Nor, must you, by any means, treat aged
<PB N="27" REF="018195_0026_0FA5C04100D75118"/>
people, however poor, after the exam∣ple of those children who mocked Gods prophet as he went along; saying, "Go up thou bald head, go up thou bald head." For they were cursed in the name of the Lord, and torn to pieces by wild beasts▪ for the breach of the fifth commandment. They did not love the commandment, and therefore did not chuse to honour old age and reverence the good man by bowing de∣cently before him. Here you have a glaring instance of the undutiful temper, and of God's displeasure in consequence of it. And both were written for your instruction. And would you be dutiful in the sight of God, when your parents direct you in the most careful manner never to take the things of orhers with dishonest hearts, you must love the eight commandment: This will make you honest worthy children. And then instead of taking the least thing from your fellows, or carrying litte pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fering hands about house, to lay hold of every thing set aside for particular use, like family thieves, you might be tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted with all the treasures of the fa∣mily. And not only so, but God would count you faithful, and "Commit to your trust the true riches." And, would
<PB N="28" REF="018195_0027_0FA5C041CAEFDDA0"/>
you always maintain a sacred regard to truth, in little things, as well as great ones▪ you must have the ninth com∣mand by heart, with love and delight. For the love of this command is the love of truth. And then instead of those deceitful faces, those false, and lying tongues, and that double dealing which looks one way and means ano∣ther, which belong to the devil's chil∣dren, you will be the children of truth who will not lye nor deceive:—For, your words and actions will always shew the meaning of your hearts.— When we hear you speak, we shall see your hearts: And when we see you act, we shall know your intentions.—Such a character as this is lovely indeed. It will bear the light. For it was Christ's character when a child, and worthy of the best imitation. And to be dutiful children it must be your's. For the deceitful, lying temper, and the dutiful temper do not agree any better than darkness and light. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, If you intend to be du∣tiful children, you must love repentance for all your past disobedience. It is probable you rather think, some of you, that you have not been disobedient. But, if you have not new hearts you
<PB N="29" REF="018195_0028_0FA5C0428A8CE5B0"/>
have been very disobedient in the sight of God, however you have appeared to others: — You have violated the fifth commandment a great many times. — And, without the most heaaty repen∣tance, you are still going on in the dis∣obedient path. A Child who is dutiful at present, is also penitent for all past disobedience. And if you desire to know what repentance is, or what you must do to repent, I will tell you as plainly as I can. It is to shun sin in∣stead of indulging it in your hearts:— Thus when parents direct dutiful chil∣dren not to keep company with the wicked▪ they are very careful to escape their company, and avoid it by every method that is lawful. They are a∣fraid to trust their hearts in the com∣pany of the wicked, lest they should be tempted to evil. But, penitent obe∣dient children love the company of each other for the sake of that sweet fellowship and agreement, which al∣ways take place between them. As birds of a feather flock together, so good children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to meet, and con∣verse about God, and Christ and eter∣nal things. And you may always know a good child by his company; and a wicked child two. For one
<PB N="30" REF="018195_0029_0FA5C04421AEB610"/>
makes choice of good company, and the other of bad. And, as soon as it is evident that a child loves the company of wicked children, there is great dan∣ger of his ruin. And it is high time for his parents to take the best care of him they are able, lest his destruction should be charged to their neglect. I could give you the history of a little boy▪ if I had opportunity, who chose the company of wicked children and was bent upon keeping such company, contrary to the directions and most positive commands of his kind parents. And the longer he kept bad company, the more disobedient he grew: For God gave him up to be disobedient. At length he was too hardened to listen to his mother, or regard his father. He came to the years of discretion with∣out any discretion, and not a better man than child. For he was so base and ungrateful▪ as to mock his weeping mother when she expressed her tears and concern respecting him: and not only so, but in a short time was such a daring monster, as not only to threaten, but strike his father in the face if he offered to reprove him. The kind aged father was grieved and cut to the heat to see his undutiful son, but was
<PB N="31" REF="018195_0030_0FA5C044C24204A8"/>
obliged to let him alone; for it was dangerous to speak to him, he had such a spiteful malicious temper. And what may we suppose has become of such a creature? But there are more sad examples of this nature than one. And it is not strange, for there are a great many disobedient children. And, if God should leave all disobedient chil∣dren to conduct in this manner, to de∣stroy themselves quickly, as he justly might, the world wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d soon be full of such painful sights. And let me tell you therefore, if you see the danger of early disobedience, you are under grea∣ter obligation to repent of it immeadi∣ately. And I hope you will remember, that to repent of disobedience, you must become obedient; and to repent of chusing bad company, you must leave it and chuse good company. So you must repent of all wicked courses by forsaking them, and chusing those that are good. And then you will have that repentance which is the con∣stant companion of the dutiful temper. But, Thirdly, If you intend to be du∣tiful chidren, you must love to be sorry for your disobedience. And if you only attend a moment, you will see the rea∣sonableness of it. For you have been
<PB N="32" REF="018195_0031_0FA5C045E7E83F60"/>
great sinners already, though you are little▪ not only, in breaking the fifth commandment, but in many other things. You are apt to think, I sup∣pose▪ your si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are very small. But this is not true:— For your sins are all committed against the great God. If God were little then your sins would be little, but as God is great, and his commandments are great, and exceed∣ing b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad, all your sins are great, every one of them. There is no such thing as a little sin: —Some sins, it is true, are greater than others, but every sin deserves God's wrath and curse both in this life, and that which is to come. Your sins are great, like mountains upon mountains, not only higher than the clouds, and stars, but infinitely high. And they are more in number than the hairs of your heads. The angels them∣selves, whose knowledge is so extensive, are not able to see the greatness of one little child's sin, because it is commit∣ted against the infinitely great Je∣hovah. How sorry then should you be for sin? It is impossible for your hearts to be too full of the deepest sorrow. And, when God gives you dutiful hearts, you will feel sorry, that you will hardly know what to do with yourselves:—
<PB N="33" REF="018195_0032_0FA5C0482E6FAA30"/>
Sin will be your greatest burden: —Sor∣row will lye down with you. and pre∣vent your sleep for hours together:—It will rise with you, and feel like a heavy pressing weight on your hearts. So I suppose the good child's heart is sorry for sin, all night, while he is asleep. Godly sorry cannot be slept away: — For it lives in the heart day and night, constantly. The good child is grieved, and out to the heart, that his kind pa∣rents have been so much dishonored by his past disobedience. He cannot for∣give himself, that he hath been so care∣less, idle, &amp; obstinate; so pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, &amp; sel∣fish; and so much in love with diso∣bedience, as not to be afraid of any thing, but correction in consequence of it.—And more than this, he won∣ders some times, that God can spare him a single moment▪ and does not cut the thread of life, and let the weight of his sins carry him down instantly to hell. He not only se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, but FEELS it to be entirely just for▪ God to punish him and all offenders, as their sins de∣serve. Thus he lies low in the dust be∣fore a just and holy God, who is infinite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y offended with him for sin.—He looks up and admires the patience of God that prevents his fal∣ling;
<PB N="34" REF="018195_0033_0FA5C048A71BE2F8"/>
he looks down, and plainly sees what he deserves, and does not feel rea∣dy to complain, if God's patience should come to an end, and let him fall into the hands of strict justice, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ap the wages of sin. And when he feels in this manner, it is his choice to be wholly at the disposal of an infinitely just, and merciful God, who can do no wrong. He is not afraid to trust him∣self entirely in the hand of God, be∣fore he knows what he will do with him. As he deserves no good, he feels that God would not treat him unjustly to give him none, and that infinite mercy only can prevent all possible evils. Thus, my children, let me tell you and I hope you will remember it, all persons feel who have new hearts, while they are thinking in a particular manner of God's justice, and their own sinfulness. And I hope you will all know, what it is to have these feelings of heart. For you cannot be dutiful children, and christians without. But let us h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sten to the next thing, for the connection between true sorrow and joy is quicker than we can speak.</P>
<P>Fourthly, If you intend to be duti∣ful children, you must love Christ with all the heart. For, God not only com∣mands
<PB N="35" REF="018195_0034_0FA5C0494659AFC8"/>
you to repent of sin, and to be heartily humble, and sorry for it, but to look, and fly to Christ immediately for salvation, in the most joyful sense. It would be wrong for men to continue sinners, if no salvation were provided for them at all. For, sin is an unreason∣able thing. No one can justify Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m for attempting to hide from God, and remaining his enemy a single moment after he fell, though he saw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o salva∣tion offered, and nothing but destruc∣tion before him. For you can easily tell, if asked, what else he should have done. Nor can we justify the wicked spirits in hell for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing God any lon∣ger, though he has no mercy for them. For it is wrong to sin against a holy God, on earth, in hell, or any where e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e. Therefore, as Christ is most freely offered, to save you, not only from sin, but from punishment too you cannot fly to him too soon, and with too much eagerness of heart for salvation. I don't mean to direct you to love Christ only to be saved from hell; for an undutiful child can do this, and re∣main an enemy to Christ, when he has done —But you must love him to be saved from sin with a holy believing love. And when you have that true
<PB N="36" REF="018195_0035_0FA5C04A06DC60D0"/>
sorrow for sin which I have just descri∣bed, you will hate sin, and be more afraid of it than you are of hell, and will feel it to be an infinite privilege, to come to Christ to be saved from it. And, as Christ hath suffered the curse, in his own body on the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oss, that those who believe and love him may be honorably s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om it, your hearts should feel warm with true thankfulness, that there is an oppor∣tunity to escape the wrath and curse of God.—As you have no righte∣ousness of your own, you are under all possible obligations to accept of Christ, who is "The Lord ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> righteousness." And since we are all nakedly exposed to God's wrath, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not in Christ by faith, and cannot be justified, and saved, but only on his acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt—since the best man on earth can do nothing acceptab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to God without him, you must go to God in his name, for strength to obey your parents, and all you need here and hereafter. But this leads to say,</P>
<P>Fifthly, If you intend to be duti∣ful children, you must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove prayer. Prayer is humbly to ask God, in the
<PB N="37" REF="018195_0036_0FA5C04AD3505218"/>
name of Christ, for all those things which are proper for him to give. And good children love to pray. They love to offer up their desires to God, for things agreeable to his will, in the name of Christ, with confession of their sins, and thankful acknowledgment of his mercy. They not only say their prayers, like little parrots, but pray with their hearts. They are peni∣tent, and humble, and love the things they ask for. When they ask for mercy, they love mercy. They love and reverence the holy name of Christ, in which they pray. And, it is a great grief to them, that they have no more repentance, and humility in their prayers. They tremble at the thought of asking amiss. And thus they often pray God earnest∣ly, to teach them to pray, that they may come before him in a holy ac∣ceptable manner, without taking his name in vain. And you must pray in this holy manner, or God will not hear you. God will not hear the prayer of any one who regards iniqui∣ty in his heart. You must then make good prayers. There is no such thing as a prayer, that is neither good, nor bad. For the conduct of reason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble creatures is not indifferent;—And a
<PB N="38" REF="018195_0037_0FA5C04B8ADE5170"/>
bad prayer you must not make; You must make such prayers as God com∣mands, and that he will accep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of for Christ's sake when made, and that will be acceptable at the great day:—And not those, which he calls nothing, and are forbidden. They must all then be made in the name—in the love—and for the sake of Christ: And then God will love you. And, if you can ex∣press yourselves without having a pray∣er by heart, you should go alone into the closet, or some other secret place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here none can see or hear you but God, and after kneeling humbly before him, confess your sins, and ask for mer∣cy in the name of Christ. Pray for all you need: Pray for your parents, your brothers, and sisters, and every body. Pray that God would manifest his love abundantly in the salvation of sinners, and that the whole world might be full of good people—And, if you can say nothing but the Lord's prayer, and the little ones in the primmer, go with love to Christ in your hearts, and say these. For God loves the little children of Christ, it gives him pleasure to see them running to him with open hearts for what they need. For his fulness is infinite, and he delights to supply them.
<PB N="39" REF="018195_0038_0FA5C04C392155F0"/>
You cannot tire God with holy prayer. And he will hear you pray at any time, and in any place whatever. As God is every where, you may pray any where. But as he loves order and re∣gularity: As the sun rises and sets ac∣cording to strict order, you must be as steady and regular as time in du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.— And particularly, in the duty of morn∣ing and evening prayer. You m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st pray before you go to bed, and when you get up. Never let the day begin, or end, without improving the best op∣portunity to get down upon your little humble knees before God, in prayer. Morning and evening mercies, and wants, call for morning and evening thanksgiving &amp; prayer. And, no crea∣ture, but the sinner, can be deaf to the call. But, such deafness we must possess. For we shall soon end a shorr life in death, and leave time for eternity. As it is therefore not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe to go out of the world without the spirit of prayer, so, without the spirit of prayer, it is not safe to live in it. And how a good child can live without daily humble prayer, I believe nobody will under∣take to tell, but the one who does not pray himself. A prayerless person may plead, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a man may be a christian,
<PB N="40" REF="018195_0039_0FA5C04CFB040840"/>
and yet live for some time together without prayer.—But, I am pretty s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the real christian will differ with him or her in opinion. For, as the natural appetite of children will lead them to ask their parents, for common food; so the holy appetite, and desires of good children, will lead them to ask their heavenly father every day for the bread of life. Hence, my children, when you feel appetites for natural food, night, and morning, it shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d make you think of your needy souls, which will perish without the bread of life. And the only way to get the bread of life is to ask for it.—For he that asketh receiveth. You will remember this in the mean time, that you must ask in faith, and not ask amiss. Therefore God says, "Let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord." If you do not love Christ God will not love your prayers. But, I suppose some of you are ready to make the common, and idle excuse, that you have no time to pray. But let me in∣treat you not to make this excuse any more, unless you have no time to die, whether prepared or unprepared, I lately read the account of a little boy eleven years old, who often continued
<PB N="41" REF="018195_0040_0FA5C04DB6E519C0"/>
on his k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees in prayer to God, half an hour, and an hour at a time. He tried to keep it a secret, that he went away, and prayed so much. But the family soon knew it, and a person one day having a mind to know what this sweet child prayed for, went and listened;
<Q>and heard him very earnestly Pray for the church of God, and desire that the gospel might be spread over the whole world, that the people of God might be more and more holy, and that the kingdom of glory might be hastened.</Q>
This child found time to pray because he loved it. It was his delight. And if prayer was your delight, you would find time also. For, God hath most certainly given us as much time as duty —He hath not commanded us to do any thing, with∣out allowing sufficient time for the per∣formance. But, if you still think you have not time to pray, let me ask you a little short question; Have you time to play? The question is answered.— And, what if you should only spend half of the time in sweet humble prayer to God that you spend, every day at play, what different children would you be? You would be little shining christians, almost too good to live out of heaven any longer.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="018195_0041_0FA5C04FEB924048"/>BUT since you may be called away by some person to attend to business before you have prayed in secret, with∣out the knowledge of your parents and masters, who have given you time for secret duties you should take the first opportunity and go again, and if inter∣rupted still, go the third time; and not only so, but the seventh time. Weary not in well doing, for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> due season ye shall reap, if ye faint not. And after proper attention, if you have time only to make the shortest prayer, whether in the house, or by the way if you make it with a good heart, God will hear you. There was a man, we read of, who only made this short prayer,— "God me merciful to me a sinner,"— and God heard, and answered him.— And if you only make such a little Prayer as this, with a humble heart, God will hear and answer you as he did that penitent man.</P>
<P>But let me tell you one thing: Don't please satan so much, as to stay alone, after you have done prayer, only to make people believe you love to pray. For this is deceitful, and nothing but hypocrisy. You may, if you have op∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tunity, stay a little while, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on what you have been doing,
<PB N="43" REF="018195_0042_0FA5C0501C2B3650"/>
and ask yourself whether you have prayed with the heart? For examina∣tion is a duty of the closet, as well as prayer. I speak to you particularly on prayer, because it is the first born of christian duties. And the dutiful child not only loves it, but has a great many things to pray for. The com∣mands of God, and consequently the directions of parents are many. And he loves to go to God for strength to obey. And dutiful children can no more live without prayer, than they can without victuals and drink. As the children of Israel used to gather manna every day to feed their bodies; so the little children of Christ, who chuse to keep themselves from idols and vanities, love to gather heavenly manna every day to feed their souls. They cannot live on past food.</P>
<P>Sixthly, if you intend to obey your parents in the Lord, you must do all these things that I have mentioned, and many more of the same nature con∣stantly, only to please the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Some children seem to be dutiful for a little while, but like the morning cloud and early dew, the very appearance is s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n gone. They are d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiful only by fits and starts, when they feel pleased

with something their parents do for them. But this does not deserve the name of duty. It is no more than skin deep. and never comes from the heart. You must therefore be dutiful all the time. There is not a moment for the undutiful temper. And, as God made you, and your parents for him∣self, you must love and honor them to please and reverence him, <Q>Child∣ren, obey your parents in the Lord.</Q> And, as the sun rises and shines, and never tires, nor rests, so you must be∣gin, and continue to be dutiful</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SECONDLY, I must now fulfil my promise, and shew in what re∣spects it is right, or beautiful, for children to obey their parents in the Lord. And, I must inform you, before I begin, that it is too beautiful for me to express. It is pleasant to see an elegant garden full of fruitful trees, use∣ful plants, and delightful flowers: So it is pleasant to see jewels and dia∣monds glisten before the sun; but, all these thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are not half so beautiful as little children, who obey their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents in the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. It is like apples of gold in pictures of silver, to see dutiful little children. It is one of the beauties of holin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss. And, what I cannot do by words in setting forth this beauty, I hope you will do in actions. For du∣tiful
<PB N="46" REF="018195_0045_0FA5C05235D2A020"/>
conduct can speak the best for it∣self. But in what this beauty consists, I will attempt to shew in the follow∣ing particulars.</P>
<P>First, it is right for children to obey their parents in the Lord, because they are so much indebted to them. God has made children greatly in debt to their parents indeed. Children are brought into the world by their pa∣rents; and are little parts of their bodies, as limbs and branches are lit∣tle parts of the tree.</P>
<P>They are therefore in debt to them for their very beings. And not only so, but in debt for all the early f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vours of life. God first gives good things to parents, and then disposes them to imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt to their children: And things are so wisely ordered, that parents can no more forget their children than themselves. They seem to love them as tenderly as themselves. And, as little infants, and children, are so feeb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and helpless, that they cannot take care of themselves, what a great favour is it, that God hath given dispositions to parents, to take care of them as they need. Little infants are some of the most helpless creatures in the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld. Some little creatures can take
<PB N="47" REF="018195_0046_0FA5C0530D7F17E8"/>
care of themselves very early. But, if parents do not take the greatest care of their children when they first come into the world, they soon go out of it again.—</P>
<P>The tender mother, who loves to hold the little babe in her arms, and feed, and nourish it, is made use of in pro∣vidence, to save its life.—And no one, I suppose, but tender parents themselves, has any just views of the care and concern that are due to chil∣dren, not only when infants, but for a number of years together, before they are fit to act for themselves. And as children require a great deal of atten∣tion, it is easy to see, how much they would suffer, and how soon they would perish, if neglected. What would be∣come of you, if father and mother were taken away, and God should not leave any kind person to take care of your little bodies and minds? You would soon become little ragged, naked crea∣tures. And not only so; but very ig∣norant too, and greatly exposed in∣deed to destruction. You therefore see, as you receive so many favours f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om your parents that you are under great obligations to obey them. And, when you only remember, that all these fa∣vours
<PB N="48" REF="018195_0047_0FA5C053DF3C8560"/>
come to you from God, only through the hands of your parents, it is altogether right to obey them in the Lord. O, how good is God to little children, to open his bountiful hand so often to them, in the kindness they receive from their parents! And how grateful and dutiful should they be when they think of it? And how often should they think of it? Therefore, when dutiful brothers, and sisters think of the constant love and attention of parents, instead of being afraid, like undutiful children, that they shall do too much for them, they never think they can do enough. And they often have little virtuous contentions among themselves, who shall do the most, and be the best child. And how charming is such a sight? But, above all things when they remember the goodness of God, in sending Christ into the world with his grace, and giving pare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts to train them up for him; how obedient will they be to their parents for Christ's sake? They will love Christ because they are baptized in his holy name, and honor their parents for his sake, because he hath disposed their hearts to devote them so early to God. They love to find themselves the children of
<PB N="49" REF="018195_0048_0FA5C05482384490"/>
christian parents, and members of Christ's baptized and sealed family. And like young Josian, and little Ti∣mothy, they early drink in the truths of scripture, and become wise unto sal∣vation. In short, these children feel so full of gratitude to God for their pa∣rents, and favour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they receive from them, that they don't know how to express it fast enough, even in dutiful obedience. And we need only ask the question:—How beautiful is it for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thus to conduct? But,</P>
<P>Secondly, It is right for children to obey their parents in the Lord, that they may be ready to assist them as they grow old and helpless. As the wisdom of providence hath made little children dependent on parents; so the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me providence hath made aged help∣less parents dependent on their chil∣dren. And, they are as much obliged to assist their aged parent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a help∣less state, as their parents were to assist them in their infancy. And, the only way to be properly prepared, to take a suitable care of aged parents, when they need as much waiting upon al∣most as infants, is for children to be∣come dutiful. If you now love your parents in a dutiful manner, you will be pleased with an opportunity of wai∣ting
<PB N="50" REF="018195_0049_0FA5C0553ACB9ED8"/>
upon them when they cannot help themselves.—For dutiful children always make kind and tender hearted men, especially to helpless parents. And, as aged people lose those pretty engaging actions that belong to chil∣dren, and become a burden to them∣selves, and often to others, you will need very dutiful hearts to dispose you to wait upon them as God requires. And if you have not dutiful hearts, you will probably neglect them a great many times, when they will stand in great need of your best kindnesses. But, if you have dutiful dispositions, you will always embrace an opportu∣nity to comfort and help them, with the greatest pleasure.—You will love to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end them when sick, and to supply them if poor: and when old age makes them children in understanding, and mere infants in strength, you will be as kind to them as though they were your own children. And this is beau∣tiful, for the kindness of children to old people is one of their best comforts: Whereas the least neglect grieves and wounds their hearts.—You may remem∣ber this, that the dutiful son treats his aged helpless parents, as he would wish to be treated if one himself. He loves the golden rule, and conducts accor∣dingly,
<PB N="51" REF="018195_0050_0FA5C0560057AD50"/>
which makes his conduct ap∣pear so beautiful toward his childish parents. And if you intend to make this your rule, and wish to have things measured out to you in old age by it, you should now take hold of it with your hearts, and be dutiful little chil∣dren. Thridly, It is right for chil∣dren to obey their parents in the Lord, that they may be the richest blessings to each other. As brothers, and sist∣ers are as near alike as nature can make them, like so many branches of the same tree, they should resemble each other in love. Yes, little brothers and sisters, whose features and actions have such a resemblance, as to be the very images of their fathers, and pictures of their mothers, should all be alike in love and friendship. All their little hearts should make but one. And then they would be brothers and sisters in∣deed, and the loveliest little creatures in the world. Therefore the scripture says,
<Q>Behold how good, and how pleasant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</Q>
It is like holy oil, and the most refreshing dews. It is not only a little picture of the family of Christ on earth, but of heaven itself, that is full of love and unity. And the only way for children to live together
<PB N="52" REF="018195_0051_0FA5C0581CACED58"/>
in this sweet and lovely manner is to be dutiful to their parents. For, if they are destitute of dutiful love, they will be of brotherly love also. The lattex cannot exist without the former. Un∣dutiful children have such unfriendly hearts that they have no holy plea∣sure in assisting one another, when there is an opportunity. But, rather chuse to vex and cross each other. And, hence it comes to pass, that the peace of the family is often disturbed with their contentions and quarrels. And it is often in vain for parents to attempt to make peace and friendship between them, when they are little, for they do not love their parents will enough to listen to their counsel and directions. And, when they grow up▪ instead of living together in love and friendship, they live in envy and malice hateful and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing one another. These are the contentious children who have so much difficulty in settleing the estate that is left by their parents. It is frequently the case, as soon as the fa∣ther is dead, and buried, and hardly cold in the grave, that the consuming fire of brotherly contention is blown up about their portions. One wants the most of the estate, and the other most, and a third at heart wants it all,
<PB N="53" REF="018195_0052_0FA5C05848F601A0"/>
though ashamed to mention it. And thus the fire soon becomes too great for them to manage. And, if kind neigh∣bours cannot quench it, and settle matters betwen them, the law must take it in hand, and end the strife.—But after all they hate each other, as long as they live: and often die with hatred in their hearts, and go to hell. You then see that you cannot be loving bro∣thers and sisters when little, and imu∣tual blessings afterwards, without the dutiful temper. But, if you become dutiful when little, you will live toge∣ther in peace and harmony like friend∣ly birds and doves, without any con∣tention. And surely if birds can live together in the same nest without strife little borthers and sisters, should fill the house with nothing but love.</P>
<P>Fourthly, It is right that you should obey your parents in the Lord, that you may be blessings to all men. Chil∣dren are not only under obligations to be blessings to their parents, to each other, and the families where they live but to be blessings to every body. But without the dutiful spirit, you will not. For instance, when the undutiful child gets into the company of others, instead of learning them to be dutiful from his example, he will learn them the contrary, as far as his influence
<PB N="54" REF="018195_0053_0FA5C05905B3D6C0"/>
reaches. As one sinner destroys much good, so one bad child often spoils a whole family of children; and fre∣quently all the children of his acquain∣tance —
<Q>Evil communication cor∣rupts good manners.</Q>
Hence if you would be a blessing to other children, you must set them good examples, and not bad ones.</P>
<P>BUT let us, my children, look a lit∣tle forward:—What will soon become of the world, if children all make their appearance in public life with unduti∣ful tempers? For, as the fruits of the earth drop off every fall, and leave their litle seeds to come up in the spring, to produce more; so old people drop away very fast; and, if children, like little tender plants, and blades, do not rise up with▪ dutiful dispositions, to fill their vacant places, there is reason to fear, the world will soon be very ripe for destruction. For, we have nothing to expect of undutiful children, as fast as they arrive at manhood, but the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sonous fruits of the unholy temper. We may not only expect to see th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make profane masters, and prayerl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> parents, but the most impious rulers, who take the shortest way satan can think of to ruin all branches of society. It is but a little way that undutiful children have to go in the path of sin,
<PB N="55" REF="018195_0054_0FA5C05A8ACB7168"/>
before swearing, cursing, and gaming, are the most pleasant practices. The open violation of God's holy law be∣comes their amusement and common diversion. And not only so, but a few years in the devil's school, will learn a youth to laugh at hell, sport with de∣struction, deny the bible, desy death, and murder himself, and others, to be happy. O take care!</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, what can be more promising and beautiful, than to see children rising up with the dutiful temper? For presently, like little tender buds and blossoms in the spring, they will yield the rich∣est fruits. They will be the joy and crown of their parents, the hope of families, and the firmest pillars of the church and state. I am willing, my little hearers, you should know that you are very capable members of socie∣ty. The usefulness of aged people is al∣most past: But little more can be expected from them. Our expectations are placed on the rising generation. And, we hope that some of you at least will be the finest men and women in the world. Nor do we hope in vain, if you now become little chris∣tians. For, if God should spare your lives, and lead you into public life, you will be the jewels and orna∣ments
<PB N="56" REF="018195_0055_0FA5C05B62C663B8"/>
of the age. And if all little children were to follow the lovely ex∣ample, the temple of God would be as wide as the world, and time itself would almost stand still, to hear them sing the sweat hosanna,
<Q>Bessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</Q>
And let us thank God with all our hearts, that the time is coming, when all the little children on earth will be holy. For the world will be blessed indeed. It will be heaven upon earth. In the mean time therefore let us be holy, and pray God to hasten on that glorious day. For he hath promised that Christ shall see the fruits of his love. And when providence is ready, it will shine. But,</P>
<P>Fifthly, I have one thing more to mention, and I shall close: It is right for little children to obey their parents in the Lord, that they may be ready for an early death. You should be entirely willing to die, as soon as God pleases. Nor can you be ready too soon. You have often heard your pa∣rents say, the young may die soon; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the old must. It is as true, my little mortals, as any thing can be∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, like the light of a candle is soon gone. It p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses away so softly, we cannot see it move: We therefore wait
<PB N="57" REF="018195_0056_0FA5C05C015FC6B0"/>
for time to come till we find it gone and out of sight. It is but a little dis∣tance from the cradle to the grave. A hand's breadth only. As soon as we begin to live, we begin to die. Short is the space between the weeping in∣fant, and the dying old man. But shorter still between the birth and death of the same child. And no age escapes death. It mows down old and young. The great and silent congregation of the dead is made up of all ages, and sizes of mankind; and if you think of it when w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lking over their sleeping dust, you will notice many little short graves among the rest. The ground is opened for little coffins as well as others. And I sup∣pose some of your little brothers, and sisters, died before your present age, and by this time are mouldered away to dust. And you should remember, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh you are so young you may yet die, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the grave before your aged pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nts. They must die soon, it is true, just as the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in the fall of the year, that have hung on through the season must be killed with the frost, and fall of directly. But, as lit∣tle tender plants, and flowers are often pin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed, and killed with an untimely frost; so the cold hand of death may
<PB N="58" REF="018195_0057_0FA5C05CC7F51430"/>
suddenly take you away while little. As I hinted at first, you may not live to see another sabbath, nor another day. Death and health are not so far apart, as you sometimes think. There is often but a step between them. And not only so, but you may be well and dead the same moment. Time and eternity join: And you may go from life to endless happiness or mis∣sery the same instant. How very im∣portant then is it▪ to be prepared for sudden death? You must then be dutiful children. For, if you die without this spirit, what will become of your poor souls? You will not be carried to heaven in the arms of kind angels, but you must be sent down to hell. And there you will lye in tor∣ment till the judgment of the great day. Then you will be brought up in dis∣tress, and anguish to be condemned, and forced immediately down again, with all the devils and damned crea∣tures. And when in hell, there you must lye millions, and millions and millions of years. You m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st lye there an ENDLESS, ENDLESS FOR∣EVER. You, and Judas, and all lost creatures will wish you had never been born. For, to be in hell will be unspeakable worse, than not to be
<PB N="59" REF="018195_0058_0FA5C05D8AEAA5B0"/>
at all. It is, in short, infinitely better not to be, than to be, and be damned. For, when you have been in hell as many millions of years, as there are stars in the skies, and as many mil∣lions more as there are drops of wa∣ter in the sea and little grains of dust in the whole earth; after all this your torment will be only just begun, and no nearer the end. Can you bear it? O, no!! For you cannot even bear your hand in the fire a single mo∣ment. What then will your poor souls do in hell? But I told you of this before, and don't know how to think of it. Yet this must be your portion if you will not be dutiful: For God is so holy, and powerful that you cannot escape his wrath if you live in sin.</P>
<P>BUT, if you obey your parents in the Lord, you will be ready to die at any time whatever. And if Christ should send the messenger of death to call you this night before the bar of God, instead of being frighted at the prospect, you might think of it with pleasure: And say as a little child did once to her parents, while weeping over her, just before she left the world. "My dear father and mother, don't mourn for me: You might well mourn for me if I were to go into utter darkness;
<PB N="60" REF="018195_0059_0FA5C05E426910C0"/>
but I am going to God in heaven. I long to be with the Lord Jesus Christ. O Lord let thy angels come and carry me." What a lovely child was this? But all children who love Christ may die in this manner. For the love of Christ triumphs over death, takes away its sting, and makes the king of terrors appear as peaceable as a lamb. For if you die with the dutiful spirit, you will not be dragged down to hell by hateful devils, but the King of Glory will open the door of heaven and the loving angels will carry you immediatly in. And all the blessed company will rejoice, and meet you with open arms. A heaven, of eternal love and friendship will be your home. You will love God and he will love you.— You will be his children, and he will be your father. All will be love and happiness. In this world you are ex∣posed to sin, pain distress, and death, but none of these will enter with you into heaven. They all belong to the other state. In one word, you will be as holy and happy as children can be. For you will be like Christ, and will live with him, and enjoy him most sweetly forever.
<PB N="61" REF="018195_0060_0FA5C05EF66C3488"/>
What then can be more beautiful, than for children to obey their parents in the Lord? What more lovely than to glorify God and enjoy him forever. For this is the chief end of man.</P>
<P>But, as hinted before, I cannot shew how beautiful it is for children to obey their parents in the Lord. It is one of the sweet beauties of holiness. And the beauty of all beauties that children are capable of: and much better felt than described.—It is therefore the wann desire of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l good people, that you should taste of this lovely beauty, then you will know what it is in reality and not before.</P>
<P>I HAVE time to say only this; as Christ hath made me your minister, I hope you will find me faithful to your souls in giving proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstructions. For he will soon call me before the judge∣ment-seat, to tell him in the presence of angels and men, what instructions I have given little children as well as others. And as you must stand before the bar of God with me. I hope you will wisely improve the good instructi∣ons you receive from parents, me, and others. For it is a great thing to be fa∣voured with the lessons of Jesus Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>? Take care then, and make such im¦provement of the privileges you enjoy
<PB N="62" REF="018195_0061_0FA5C06104EC9308"/>
that the little heathen may not rise up in judgement against you. We have, my tender children but a little while to live together. We shall soon die. And whether I shall live to see a num∣ber of you grow up, or be taken away the first, God only knows. But this we know, that we shall all quickly sleep in the dust. Pray then, let us not live as we sleep, and dream life away with∣out the improvement of it. But, let us wake up from the dead sleep of sin, and attend to duty with all our hearts. As we have lost a great deal of precious time already, let us diligent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y redeem it. Since we are mortal, let us redeem time to die. Let us save, and improve our time so carefully, as always, to have a leisure, peaceful moment for death. Instead of being found at death, in a conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed, distracted hurry of thought, let us rather have all things prepared, and wait till our great change come. But in order to make death a welcome messenger, lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the little child just mentioned, you must possess her dutiful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per. To die a peaceful death you must live a ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y life.</P>

<P>BUT, while I close, let me address a word to the youth of the congregation. And what more important than the text? Children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. You are yet with∣in the reach of this great command. And, that you are under the greatest obligations to yeld the most cordial obedience, is a most evident truth, or I would ask you just to think of the tender mother who bare you, and the kind father who has provided for you.

What more proper, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to fall down immediatly before the throne of grace with sincere repen∣tance, and deep humility of heart and ask for mercy like the returning son.

<P>I THOUGHT of a word to par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts, but inspiration prevents me. "And ye Fathers pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Train up a child in the way he should go, &amp; when he is old he will not depart from it." Your duty is as plain as the sun. You are charged with the educa∣tion of little Immortals for Christ and eternal glory. And need I say, the happiest method you can adopt to satisfy the high demands of parental duty; is constantly, to make the best p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayers for them—to give the best in∣structions to them—maintain the best government over them, and live the best lives before them. If you have not adopted the method already, I wish you wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom to do it immedia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. I wish you the resolution of Joshua, the faithfulness of Abraham and the con∣stant guidance and influence of the ho∣ly spirit. I wish you more than grace to be faithful—I wish you may be successful.

<P>As it is the duty of children, to employ their early breath in secret prayer:—and the duty of parents and others, as opportunity offers, to furnish them, with suitable expressions, for this grateful perfor∣mance; the Author takes liberty in connection with the proceding discourses, to add the following easy forms of prayer: and hopes they will be in some measure useful.</P>

<P>O LORD, in the morning thou shalt hear my voice, in the morning, will I direct my prayer unto thee, and look up. And while I humble myself as a little child before thee in prayer, look down, O Father, in thy tender mercy, and ac∣cept of me for the sake of Jesus Christ, in whose name I pray.—Blessed be thy constant goodness, that I have not slept the sleep of death, and that my so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l is not confined in endless darkness. For tho' a little child, I am a sinner. I was shapen in iniquity; and born with a very sinful nature. I brought into the world a heart full of opposition to truth. and holiness. I have therefore, not only broken thy holy law, but have slighted Christ, and despised the salvation of the gospel. O Lord, I confess, my sins, and freely acknowledge I desereve nothing, but thy present wrath, and the endless pains of hell. But, with true submission to thy infinite justice, I humbly ask, and hope for mercy, in the worthy name of Christ, because he hath borne the curse: and mer∣cy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> freely, and wisely offered for his sake.

Give me more of Christ's lovely temper, that I may honour him in all my words, and actions, and live in some measure, as he did when a child. And, as thou hast favored me with another day▪ prepare me for all the duties, and events of it. Give me wisdom not only to depart from evil; but to see and escape every rising temptation. Never let me be so foolish, as to trust my own heart. Give me therefore thy fatherly hand, and lead me still in the path of duty. For, without thee I can do nothing. As time is short, and swift, and never waits for old nor young, let not duty wait for me. But, may I improve my precious moments as they fly, with the greatest diligence. Let duty be my great and only delight. Teach me to honor my parents by a steady obedience to their wise commands. Enable me to love my brothers, and sisters, and all my fellow crea∣tures, according to thy will. Have mercy on all persons in distress. Provide for the poor, and give them the riches of thy grace. Tenderly regard thy feeble children, and make them perfect. Awaken sinners, who sleep in danger of destruction, and lead them safely to Christ for salvation.

<P>GREAT and glorious God, blessed be thy name, for the light of another morning▪ and blessed be thy Son's name, for the gracious light, and beauty of the Sabbath. Thy mercy, O Lord, is infinite!

And, as this day is set apart for religious service, to honour the great Redeemer, who is Lord of the Sabbath, give me thy early pre∣sence, that I may spend it, in a holy manner. Take off my affections from the vanities of the world, and prepare me for this closet duty, in which I am now engaged. Fit me for morning meditations—for all the duties of the family, and for the entertainments and delights of thy house. Reach me therefore thy guiding hand, and lead me to the sanctuary. Let me not speak my own words, nor think my own thoughts while going to thy house, nor indulge an idle desire in it. Open my ears to hear the truth, with attention; and enlarge my heart to embrace it. Give me grace to worship thee in spirit, and in truth that my service may be acceptable.
