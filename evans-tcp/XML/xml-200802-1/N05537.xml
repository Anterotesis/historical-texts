<BIBL>PSALM cxxix. 1, 2.</BIBL>
<Q><L><HI>Many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth, may</HI> Israel <HI>now say:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.</HI></L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A <HI>Century</HI> from the <HI>Incorporation</HI> of the <HI>Town, this Day</HI> expires—And altho' it was long a Frontier, and has often suffer'd the Fury of the Enemy; is yet fair, and flourish∣ing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> of GOD has been his peculiar Care in all Ages of the World—And therefore altho' the Seed of the Serpent have often persecuted the Seed of the Woman; yet they have never been able fully to accomplish their Desires—The Adversary hath often lifted up the Horn,
<PB N="2" REF="007020_0005_102AE9A38DFAF6D8"/>
and they that hate <HI>Mount-Sion</HI> have often bro't her low; yet they have been no more than a Scourge in the Hand of GOD, to chastise his People, to correct what was amiss, and to make them more humble and servent in his Ser∣vice: Yet the Enemy meant not so.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>this World</HI> is in a <HI>militant</HI> State, and may well expect shocking Assaults from those that hate her.—She hath been troubled on every Side, and perplexed, but not in Despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; a Bush burning, but not consumed.</P>
<P>It was frequently thus with <HI>Israel,</HI> while they continu'd the peculiar People of God—Many a Time have they af∣flicted me from my Youth up, may <HI>Israel</HI> now say, many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.</P>
<P>Interpreters agree that this Psalm was written, when some new and heavy Calamity either pressed hard upon, or impended that People.—But whether when <HI>Senacherib,</HI> with the Host of <HI>Assyria</HI> invaded <HI>Judea;</HI> or when <HI>Sanbal∣lat,</HI> and Confederates, after the Return of the Captivity, made Interest against them in the Court of <HI>Persia;</HI> or at some other calamitous Season; is neither easy, nor im∣portant to determine.</P>
<P>For whatever was the particular Occasion of the Writ∣ing; the Design is manifestly to excite that People to a serious Recollection of the numerous Calamities bro't upon them by their Enemies, ever since their being taken into Covenant with, and made the peculiar People of God—As also to acknowledge the merciful Interpositions of God for them; who notwithstanding their frequent Rebellions against him, had not suffered their Enemies so far to pre∣vail, as to cut them off from being a People.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="007020_0006_102AE9A59E2E2E58"/>
<HI>Yet they have not prevailed against me,</HI> is not to be under∣stood in the strictest Sense, as if they had never been over∣come, or bro't into Subjection by their Enemies—for in this Sense it is not true, as appears from the Scripture-History of that Church and People.—</P>
<P>The Meaning therefore is, they have never been able wholly to extirpate us, or to cut us off from being a Church and Nation.—</P>
<P>Our Text is well paraphras'd by a learned Prelate.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bp. <HI>Patrick</HI> in loc.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>Our Adversaries may <HI>Israel</HI> now on this Occasion say, have very often, and very sorely distressed us, ever since we began to be a People; it is hard to tell how often, or into how great Straits they have reduc'd us, since we began to be a Nation; and yet by the special Favour of God, they have never been able to accomplish their De∣sire of our utter Extirpation.</Q></P>
<P>From the Words let us consider,</P>
<P>I. The <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of GOD, as frequently afflicted by their Enemies, and yet preserv'd from utter Ruin:</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>II. As ascribing the Glory of their Preservation unto GOD.</P>
<P>I. Then let us consider the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of GOD, as frequently afflicted by their Enemies, and yet preserved from utter Ruin.</P>
<P>The History of their Affliction and Preservation, from their sojourning in <HI>Egypt,</HI> to the Reign of <HI>Abasuerus</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> you have on sacred Record, and is therefore un∣necessary to be recited here.—</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Stackhouse,</HI> on the State of the <HI>Jews</HI> under the <HI>Persian, Gre∣cians</HI> &amp; <HI>Romans,</HI> to the Coming of Christ—And <HI>Prideaux'</HI>s Connect.</NOTE> After the Return of the <HI>Captivity</HI> from BABYLON, the <HI>Jews</HI> were subject to the <HI>Persians</HI> till the Destruction of their Empire—and had the Privilege of being govern'd by their own Laws, under the Administration of the <HI>Tirshatha,</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>High Priest,</HI> and great <HI>Sanhedrim.</HI></P>
<P>But when the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire arose on the Ruins of the <HI>Persian,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> became subject to <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Great</HI>—who being incens'd by them, while at the Siege of <HI>Tyre,</HI> immediately after the Reduction of it, marched for <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> with a Design of severe Revenge.—In this Dis∣tress, God directed <HI>Jaddua,</HI> the high Priest, in his ponfical Robes, with the Priests in their Habits, and the Inhabitants of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in white Garments, to go forth in Procession, to meet him.</P>
<P>This was exactly agreable to a Vision he had seen at <HI>Dio</HI> in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> encouraging him to march into <HI>Asia,</HI> and assuring him of the Conquest—At the first Sight there∣fore <HI>Alexander</HI> concluded him to be the Priest of that God, who conducted his Arms; and embracing him with Re∣spect, went into the City, and offer'd Sacrifice to the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> and at his Departure granted large Favours to them.</P>
<P>After the Death of <HI>Alexander,</HI> his Empire was divided among <HI>four</HI> of his <HI>Captains,</HI> the <HI>four Horns</HI> spoken of in the Prophet <HI>Daniel.</HI>—And <HI>Egypt</HI> fell to the Share of <HI>Pte∣lomy Soter,</HI> who laid Siege to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and making a general Assault on the Sabbath, when the <HI>Jews</HI> supersti∣tously refused to defend themselves, he carried the City, and captivated <HI>an Hundred Thousand.</HI>—But on Considera∣tion of their Fidelity to former Princes, to whom they had
<PB N="5" REF="007020_0008_102AE9A9532E4B28"/>
been subjected, he confer'd on them many valuable Privi∣leges and Immunities.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Jews</HI> continu'd subject to <HI>Egypt</HI> about <HI>an Hun∣dred Years</HI>—but then a War arising between <HI>Ptolomy Epi∣phanes</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Antiochus</HI> the great King of <HI>Syria,</HI> and <HI>Antiochus</HI> being victorious in the War, the <HI>Jews</HI> submitted unto him.</P>
<P><HI>Seleucus Philopator,</HI> succeeded <HI>Antiochus</HI> in the Throne of <HI>Syria,</HI> who being inform'd of immense Treasures in the Temple at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> sent <HI>Heliodorus</HI> to make Seizure of them; and he forcibly entering the Temple for that Pur∣pose, was struck Speechless by a Vision, fell to the Ground, and was carried off by his Servants, frustrated in his Design.</P>
<P><HI>Antiochus Epiphanes,</HI> a most cruel Persecutor of the Church &amp; People of God, succeeded <HI>Seleucus</HI>—He assaulted <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and took it, and flew <HI>forty Thousand,</HI> and sold as many into Slavery—He also forced himself into the <HI>Holy</HI> of <HI>Holies,</HI> he offer'd a Swine on the Altar of <HI>Holo∣caust,</HI> defiled the Temple, and plundered both That, and the City.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide 2 <HI>Maccab.</HI> 3, 4, 5, 6 &amp; 7 Chapters.</NOTE> And as if this had been but a small Thing, he after∣wards sent one of his Generals with an Army and express Order to destroy all the Men remaining in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and to enslave the Women and Children; who fell on the City on the Sabbath, when they were at their Devotions, massa∣cred the Men, and captivated the Women and Children.</P>
<P>After this came forth an Edict, for all Nations [but chiefly levelled at the <HI>Jews</HI>] to forsake their own Religion, and conform to that of the King.—</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007020_0009_102AE9AB5C013468"/>
And the Officer to whom he had committed the Exe∣cution of this <HI>unreasonable Decree,</HI> coming to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> caused <HI>the Daily Sacrifice to cease,</HI> suppressed the Rites of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Worship, burnt <HI>the Law</HI> of <HI>Moses;</HI> consecrated the <HI>Temple</HI> to <HI>Jupiter Olympius,</HI> set up his Image on the Altar, and compell'd the People on Pain of Death to of∣fer Sacrifice to it.</P>
<P>Such as were found assembled for divine Worship in the Caves were burnt—And <HI>Eleazer, Solomona</HI> and her seven Sons, with numerous others, chose rather to submit to the most exquisite Torments, than forsake their God.</P>
<P>And to this Time it is suppos'd the Author of the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> alludes; saying, <Q>Some were tor∣tured not accepting Deliverance, that they might obtain a better Resurrection—Others had Trial of cruel Mock∣ings, yea moreover of Bonds and Imprisonments: They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were <HI>burned,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Whithy</HI> on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lace.</NOTE> were slain with the Sword—They wandered about in Sheepskins, and Goatskins, in the Deserts &amp; Mountains, Dens and Caves of the Earth, destitute, afflicted, tor∣mented.</Q></P>
<P>But altho' God at this Time severely rebuked his Peo∣ple, yet He did not utterly forsake them; but excited <HI>Mat∣tathias,</HI> and his <HI>valiant Sons,</HI> to stand up in the Cause of <HI>Israel;</HI> who raising Armies, not only made a gallant Stand, but obtain'd many signal Victories over their Oppressors.—And <HI>three Years</HI> and <HI>a half</HI> after the Pollution of the Temple, they pur<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>'d it, and afresh dedicated it to the Lord; which was the Original of the Feast <HI>of Dedication</HI> spoken of in the New-Testament.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007020_0010_102AE9AD1FFFC1D8"/>
The <HI>Maccabean Family</HI> are said to have held the Go∣vernment of <HI>Judea</HI> for <HI>above an Hundred Years;</HI> and some Part of the Time as Sovereign Princes, until a Difference arising between <HI>Hyrcanus</HI> and <HI>Aristobulus,</HI> two Princes of that Blood; they reter'd it to <HI>Pompey</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> General, then in <HI>Calosyria</HI>—But he refusing fully to hear the Matter before his Arrival in <HI>Jerusalem; Aristobulus</HI> distrusting his Cause, fled and shut up himself in the For∣tress of <HI>Alexandrian;</HI> but on the Approach of <HI>Pompey,</HI> surrendred himself.—However, his Party at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> seized the Mount of the Temple, and made Preparation for a vigorous Defence—On which <HI>Pompey</HI> marched his whole Army to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> besieg'd and took the Place, and put <HI>Twelve Thousand</HI> to the Sword.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Rusus</HI> another <HI>Roman</HI> General, plundered the Temple.—And,</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, the Son of <HI>Antipas,</HI> a noble <HI>Idumean,</HI> obtain'd the Kingdom of <HI>Judea,</HI> by a full Vote of the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate.—In his Time OUR BLESSED LORD was born, and the Infants murdered at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI></P>
<P>But notwithstanding the Afflictions of <HI>Israel,</HI> from the Infancy of their Nation, they continu'd the Church and peculiar People of God, until the Appearance of the MESSIAS, to take down the Wall of Partition between <HI>Jew</HI> &amp; <HI>Gentile,</HI> and until the Constitution they were under had stood it's appointed Time—And until by the greatest of all Crimes, the <HI>Crucisixion</HI> of their MESSIAS, they had provoked God to deliver them to the Power of their Ene∣mies.—</P>
<P>And the Preservation of the <HI>Christian</HI> Church under her Affliction and Adversity, hath been as remarkable as the Preservation of the <HI>Jewish.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007020_0011_102AE9B116EFF6A8"/>
For altho' the People of the <HI>Jews</HI> combined against it; and altho' the <HI>Heathen</HI> rag'd, the Kings of the Earth set themselves, and the Rulers took Counsel together to over∣throw it; yet their Counsels were turn'd into Foolishness, and they unable to accomplish their Desire.—The Me∣thods they pursued were had in Derision by the King of <HI>Zion,</HI> and overul'd to the quicker Spread, and Establish∣ment of the Truth.—</P>
<P>The holy Lives of the primitive Christians; the Con∣stancy and Intrepidity of the Martyrs in Prisons, Flames, and Death, under the Ten Persecutions of <HI>Rome Heathen,</HI> were more effectual to the Promotion of Christianity, than all the Stratagem, and Fury of the Enemy to it's suppression.—For this Reason <HI>the Blood of the Martyrs is</HI> call'd <HI>the Seed of the Church</HI>—And thus Christianity triumph'd over all it's Adversaries, until <HI>Constantine</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> was fully seated on the Imperial Throne,—when it became the establish'd Religion of the Roman Empire—And for some time the Church was in Prosperity &amp; Peace.</P>
<P>However,</P>
<P>Before the Death of <HI>Constantine,</HI> the <HI>Arian</HI> Heresy ap∣pear'd: and at last the Asserters of it became so numerous powerful and malevolent, as to persecute those who ad∣hered to the Apostolic Faith.</P>
<P>After this, came on the <HI>Roman</HI> Apostacy, and <HI>Papal</HI> Tyranny: Errors &amp; Superstitions over whelm'd the whole <HI>Western</HI> Church—To which may be added,</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometan</HI> Imposture in the <HI>Eastern;</HI> and the Oppressing the Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> by the <HI>Saracen</HI> Power; under which they groan to this Day.—</P>
<P>But to return; altho' the <HI>Western</HI> Church suffer'd under <HI>Papal</HI> Oppressions; yet even in the thickest Darkness,
<PB N="9" REF="007020_0012_102AE9B306274970"/>
there was a Remnant, who did not bow the Knee to <HI>Baal;</HI> the <HI>Vandois,</HI> and <HI>Waldenses</HI> inhabiting the Valleys of <HI>Pied∣mont.</HI> And,</P>
<P>Besides these, almost in every Age God raised up Wit∣nesses to the Truth, until the <HI>sixteenth Century;</HI> when <HI>Luther,</HI> and a Number of pious Reformers, arose in <HI>Germany,</HI> boldly contending for the Truth, against the Errors &amp; Usurpations of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>And divers <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> embracing the reform'd Religion, boldly in a Diet of the Empire, <HI>protested</HI> against a Decree which was made against it; whereby they ac∣quir'd the glorious Name of <HI>Protestants.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Germany,</HI> the Reformation spread into <HI>England;</HI> Way being made for it, by the renouncing of the Popes Supremacy, and by other Transactions in the Reign of King HENRY the VIII.</P>
<P>And therefore on the Accession of EDWARD the VI. to the Crown, <HI>Arch Bp. Cranmer,</HI> Bp.<HI>Latimer,</HI> Bp.<HI>Ridley,</HI> and other excellent Persons, under the Approbation and Pa∣tronage of that pious Prince, carried it on to a very con∣siderable L—</P>
<P>When God thus turn'd again the Captivity of <HI>Sion,</HI> they were like those that Dream; then their Mouth was filled with Laughter, and they said among their Enemies, The Lord had done great Things for them, whereof they were glad.—</P>
<P>However these pious Reformers, by Reason of the Temper and Circumstances of the Times, and the praema∣ture Death of that good Prince, cou'd not carry on the Reformation so far as they earnestly desir'd.—</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="007020_0013_102AE9B597FFC4B0"/>
And on the Accession of the Princess MARY, a black and heavy Cloud overspread the noble Design; the Roman Superstition was restor'd and the Professors of the reform'd Religion were persecuted to the Stake and Death—</P>
<P>But on the Accession of the Princess ELIZABETH, the reform'd Religion was re-established. However, neither that illustrious Princess, nor King JAMES the I. her Suc∣cessor, nor their Clergy, would suffer the Reformation to be carried on further, than it had been in the Reign of King EDWARD.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the Reign of Q. ELIZABETH, an Act of Parliament was pass'd requiring <HI>Uniformity</HI> in Worship under very severe Penalties;—continued by K. <HI>James</HI> I, and more severely urged by K. CHARLES I;</P>
<P>Our <HI>Fathers</HI> therefore, earnestly desiring a greater Re∣formation, and Liberty to Worship God according to their Consciences, chose rather to expose themselves to almost any Hardships, than violate them.—</P>
<P>And having obtain'd Liberty of King <HI>James</HI> the I, to re∣move, and set down within certain Limits in <HI>America,</HI> with Liberty of Worshiping God according to that Way which appear'd to them most agreable to Scripture;—</P>
<P>They left their native Country, and cross'd the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> with their Families, into this then howling Wilderness—<HI>founding</HI> the Colony of <HI>Plymouth</HI> in 1620.—And the Colony of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> in the Year 1630.—</P>
<P>And after their Arrival, for the Trial of their Faith and Patience, God exercis'd them with grievous and mortal Sicknesses, with Scarcity &amp; Famine—Yet they soon spread abroad; and before the Year 1636, had founded the Colo∣ny of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and had planted in other Parts.—</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007020_0014_102AE9B902E1F5F8"/>
But in the Year 1636, the <HI>Pequots,</HI> the most fierce and Warlike of all the <HI>Indian</HI> Tribes in that Part of the Coun∣try, and formidable to all their Neighbours; having com∣mitted many barb<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> Outrages on the <HI>Narragansetts,</HI> to the Eastward, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the <HI>Northward</HI> of them; on the <HI>Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dutch,</HI> as they occasionally came among them, and on the Planters on <HI>Connecticut</HI> River—The Colonies unanimously raised their Forces, and cut off <HI>seven Hundred;</HI> and Part of those that escaped the <HI>English</HI> Sword, fled to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and were destroy'd by them; and the other were by the <HI>English</HI> subjected to, and incor∣porated with the <HI>Narragansetts</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI>—</P>
<P>After this, there was general Peace and Prosperity for a considerable Term.</P>
<P>Thus much in general: we now proceed to a particular Consideration of the Affairs of <HI>this Town.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1645, <HI>Sholan,</HI> alias <HI>Shaumauw,</HI> Proprietor of <HI>Nashawogg,</HI> and <HI>Sachem</HI> of the <HI>Nastawas,</HI> who lived at <HI>Wausnacum,</HI> inform'd Mr. <HI>Thomas King</HI> of <HI>Watertown</HI> [with whom he traded, and for whom he had a considerable Friendship] of the said Tract of Land as well accommo∣dated for a Plantation, desiring that the <HI>English</HI> wou'd come and set down by him.</P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. <HI>King,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Presect,</HI> and others,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Hablard'</HI>s Narrative, Page 5. <HI>Harmon Garrett, Thomas Skidmore,</HI> Mr. <HI>Day,</HI> Mr. <HI>Symonds,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> procured of said <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lan,</HI> a Deed of said <HI>Nathawogg, Ten</HI> Miles in Length, and <HI>Eight</HI> in Breadth; with <HI>these Re∣strictions,</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> shou'd not molest the <HI>Indians</HI> in their <HI>Hunting, Fishing,</HI> or <HI>usual Planting Places</HI>—And the General Court confirm'd the Deed.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="007020_0015_102AE9BA8E9EAD00"/>
On this, the <HI>Associates</HI> purchas'd of Mr. <HI>King</HI> all his Interest in the Premises; and entred into mutual Obliga∣tion by a certain Term to appear on the Spot, to begin and carry on the Plantation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a Preach∣er to go on with them.</P>
<P>Having thus concerted Affa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey sent up diverse Persons,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Richard Licton, Laurence Waters,</HI> and <HI>John Ball.</HI></NOTE> [to whom they had given Lots] to perform diverse Things, a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e common Expence of the Proprie∣tors, before the Time for their general Appearance; and these were the first Inhabitants.</P>
<P>But before the Time for their general Appearance; <HI>their Minister,</HI> to whom they had committed their mutual Obligation, [whether by Reason of his own Aversion to the Place, or by the Instigation of such of the Proprietors as were unwilling to come up themselves, is uncertain] forsook them, carrying with him said mutual Obligation. And in Consequence of this all the <HI>Associates,</HI> except Mr. <HI>Prescot,</HI> refus'd to fulfil their Contract, but yet held their Interest. So that for the Space of <HI>seven Years,</HI> very little was done to forward the Plantation.—But at Length some of the Rest being willing to engage more heartily in the Affair; On the <HI>eighteenth</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> 1653, there being <HI>Nine Families</HI> in the Place, they petition'd the General Court for an Incorporation, and obtain'd it by the Name of LANCASTER.</P>
<P>From the Year 1654, Mr. <HI>Rowlandson</HI> preach'd among them, until the 14th of <HI>April</HI> 1658; at which Time they invited him to settle in the Work of the Ministry among them; and he accepted their Invitation, and probably was ordained the same Year.—</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007020_0016_102AE9BC7575E9C0"/>
The Town was in Peace and Prosperity for the Space of <HI>Twenty-two Years</HI> from it's Incorporation.—And the <HI>Indians</HI> were very serviceable to the Inhabitants, by supply∣ing them with such <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and wild Meat as they stood in Need of; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> moderate Terms.—</P>

<P>In 1688. <HI>William,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> arriv'd in <HI>England,</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> abdicated the Throne; whose Cause the <HI>French King</HI> espousing, involv'd the Na∣tion in a War with <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>New-England</HI> in a War with the <HI>Canadians, French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>—In the Calamities of which this Town had a large Share.—</P>

<P>In 1695, on a <HI>Lord's Day Morning,</HI> Mr. <HI>Abraham Wheeler,</HI> going from Garrison to his own House, on some Occasion, was there shot by an Enemy, that had laid in Ambush for him; but altho' mortally wounded, he rest∣ed the Gun from him, and bro't it towards the Garrison, 'till met by his Friends.—</P>
<P>In 1697. A considerable Body of the Enemy, under <HI>five Commanders,</HI> but <HI>one in Chief,</HI> came &amp; lurk'd in the Woods for some Time, sending in their Scouts by Night to ob∣serve the Posture of the Town.—And having done this, they determin'd to begin the Attack on Mr. <HI>Thomas Sawyer'</HI>s Garrison; and the firing at that was to be a Sig∣nal to all the Rest, to fall on in their respective Stations.</P>
<P>And accordingly on the <HI>Eleventh</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> when the Inhabitants, suspicious of no Enemy, were gone out to their Labour; they came in several Companies into the Town, and were very near surprizing said <HI>Sawyer'</HI>s Garrison, both the Gates being left open; but that Mr. <HI>Jabez Fairbank,</HI> who was at his own House half a Mile's Distance, and designing to bring his little Son from said Garrison, mounted his Horse which came running to him in a Fright; and rode full Speed into the Gate, but yet nothing suspicious of an Enemy—However, this was a Means of saving the Garrison: for the Enemy who were

just ready to rush into it, supposing they were discover'd, gave over that Design; and fir'd at such as were out in the Fields.—</P>
<P>At that Time, the Rev. Mr. <HI>John Whiting</HI> being on some Occasion at a Distance from his Garrison, they sur∣priz'd and kill'd him.—They indeed offer'd him Quar∣ter; but he chose rather to fight to the last, than resign himself to those whose tender Mercies are Cruelty.—</P>
<P>At the same Time they kill'd <HI>Twenty</HI> others; wounded <HI>two,</HI> but not mortally; and captivated <HI>Six, five</HI> of whom returned.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>Killed. Rev.

<P>From 1697 to 1700, several Gentlemen supplied the Pulpit.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Robinson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whitman.</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was in∣vited to settle, but Difficulties arising, his Ordination was prevented, and he remov'd.</NOTE></P>
<P>In <HI>May</HI> 1701, Mr. <HI>Andrew Gardner</HI> was invited to preach, and in <HI>September</HI> following was invited to settle in the Ministry.—</P>
<P>In 1704, there came an Army of <HI>seven Hundred French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Canada</HI>—with <HI>two Tribes,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Monst.

<P><PB N="19" REF="007020_0022_102AE9C8D0E52E18"/>
Moreover, in their March there arose a Mutiny among them about the Division of the Plunder; and the Conten∣tion rose so high, that <HI>above two Hundred</HI> of them return'd—But the Rest came on, and sent out their <HI>Scouts,</HI> who reported, that the <HI>English</HI> were ready in great Numbers to receive them.—On this they call'd a Council of War, in which they concluded to lay aside the Design on <HI>Northamp∣ton</HI>—and to beat up for Voluntiers, for the Assault of <HI>Lan∣caster;</HI> and a large Number enlisted.—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the Accounts which Mr. <HI>Penhallow</HI> hath given of the Mischiefs done in this Town by the Enemy, are in diverse Cases not only imperfect, but very <HI>Erroneous,</HI> which are doubtless owing to the wrong Information he had.</NOTE></P>
<P>And on the 30th of <HI>July</HI> they came within about <HI>two Miles</HI> of the Town—and encamp'd, and by Night sent in their Spies to observe the Posture of the <HI>English.</HI>—And on the 31st, they fell furiously upon the Town early in the Morning; and in their first Onset kill'd Lieut. <HI>Nathanael Wilder,</HI> near the Gate of his own Garrison.—And the same Day <HI>three</HI> others near the same Garrison.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Abraham How, John Spaulding,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Hutchins.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The Enemy were uncommonly brave: and therefore altho' Capt. <HI>Tyng,</HI> who had the Command of the Garrison Soldiers; and Capt. <HI>How,</HI> who on the Alarm, march'd immediately from <HI>Marlborough</HI> with what Men he cou'd suddenly raise; and the Inhabitants maintain'd a warm Dispute with them for some Time; yet being much in∣feriour in Number were oblig'd to retreat into Garrison.—On which they burnt the Meeting-House, and six other Buildings, &amp; destroy'd much of the live Stock of the Town. <HI>Note,</HI> What Numbers of the <HI>Enemy</HI> were kill'd, either in the Field, or at the other Garrison is uncertain, but is tho't to be considerable—among the Rest a <HI>French Officer</HI> of some Distinction, was mortally wounded, which greatly exasperated their Spirits:</P>

Before Night there came such Numbers to the Relief of the Town, that the Enemy retreated; and altho' pur∣sued, yet <HI>were</HI> not over-taken. Had they like those in 1697, tarried till the Inhabitants, were dispers'd to their Labour, they might in all human Probability, have done much greater Mischief, if they had not entirely destroy'd the Town.—But God had Mercy on his People.—</P>
<P>On the 26th of <HI>October</HI> following, there having been a Party of the Enemy discover'd at <HI>Still-River,</HI> the Soldiers and Inhabitants belonging to the Rev.

And on the 18th of <HI>August</HI> following, <HI>Twenty-four</HI> stout <HI>Indians,</HI> who according to their own Account had all been Captains, came to <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and captivated Mr. <HI>Jo∣nathan Wilder,</HI> a Native of this Town, and but lately re∣mov'd from it.—The <HI>next Day</HI> being persu'd by about <HI>Thirty</HI> of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and <HI>Lancaster;</HI> and overtaken—the Front of our Men came upon them before they had the least Apprehension of a Pursuit.</P>
<P>Their Packs were all slung, and it being a misty Day, their Cases were on their Guns.—And therefore had ours <HI>all</HI> run down upon them, they might easily have destroy'd or taken all, and sav'd the Life of the Captive.—The Enemy themselves at the first Appearance of our Men, had determin'd to resign themselves to their Mercy.—But observing that but <HI>Ten</HI> of the <HI>Thirty</HI> came down upon them, they took Courage, unslung their Packs, and fought like Men—having first dispatch'd their Captive.</P>
<P>In this Action, the Enemy lost <HI>Nine</HI> and all their Packs; and on our Part <HI>Two,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>John Farrar,</HI> and—<HI>Singleterry.</HI></NOTE> were kill'd, and <HI>Two</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Ephraim Wilder,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Stevens.</HI></NOTE> wounded, but not mortally.</P>

The <HI>Records</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> in Mr. <HI>Rowlandson'</HI>s Time, were in all Probability consum'd in his Garrison.—And the Records in Mr. <HI>Whiting'</HI>s Day not being to be found, we have no Account of the Number of <HI>Communicants,</HI> or of <HI>Baptisms,</HI> from the founding this Church to the Or∣dination of the Rev.

<P>But during Mr. <HI>Prentice'</HI>s Ministry, 331 were received to full Communion, and 1593 Baptiz'd.—</P>
<P>After a Life of much Service, Faithfulness, and lov'd, on the 6th of <HI>January</HI> 1747, 8. the Rev. Mr. <HI>Prentice</HI> de∣ceas'd, greatly lamented.—</P>

<P>So that from <HI>March</HI> 1708, to this Day, 401 have been admitted to full Communion, and 1814 Baptiz'd.</P>
<P>Of the Members in this Church was form'd a conside∣rable Part of the Church in <HI>Harvard</HI> in 1733.</P>

<P>With Propriety therefore this Church may say; Many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth, many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth; yet they have not prevail'd against me.—</P>
<P>Proceed we now to a brief Consideration of the</P>

<P><HI>Yet they have not prevail'd against me,</HI> is design'd not only to assert their Preservation from utter Ruin, but also
<PB N="23" REF="007020_0026_102AE9D1AC66ED98"/>
to ascribe the Glory of it unto GOD—Unto GOD, who in Consequence of their peculiar Relation to Him, and of his gracious Promises to Them, had gloriously appear'd for them in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and at the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> and often afterwards, when endanger'd or oppress'd by Enemies, more nume∣rous and powerful than themselves.</P>
<P>These Ascriptions are common in the sacred Pages.—<Q>We have heard with our Ears, O God, our Fathers have told us what Work thou didst in their Days, in the Times of old<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 44. 1.</NOTE>—If it had not been the LORD, who was on our Side, now may <HI>Israel</HI> say—If it had not been the LORD, who was on our Side, when Men rose up against us; then they had swallowed us up <HI>quick,</HI> when their Wrath was kindled against us—Then the Waters had over∣whelm'd us; then the proud Waters had gone over our Soul—Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us a Prey to their Teeth—Our Help is in the Name of the LORD.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 124.—145, 11—14. inclusi. <HI>Isai.</HI> 63. 7, 8.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>These Acknowledgements &amp; Ascriptions are not only founded on the Reason and Nature of Things; but also enjoin'd by divine Authority, to keep divine Benefits in Memory, to inspire succeeding Generations with Gratitude, and to engage them effectually in the Fear and Service of the most high GOD—Accordingly we have the Church of <HI>Israel</HI> assigning this as a Reason of her Practice.—</P>
<P><Q>We will shew to the Generation to come the Praises of the LORD, and his Strength, and his wonderful Works that he hath done—For he established a Testi∣mony in <HI>Jacob,</HI> and appointed a Law in <HI>Israel,</HI> which he commanded our Fathers that they shou'd make <HI>them</HI> known to their Children—That the Generation to come might know <HI>them,</HI> even the Children which shou'd be
<PB N="24" REF="007020_0027_102AD2AA9BD23910"/>
born; who shou'd arise and declare them to their Chil∣dren—That they might set their Hope in GOD, and not forget the <HI>Works</HI> of GOD, but keep his <HI>Commands,</HI> and be stedfast with him.</Q></P>
<P>The Deliverance of <HI>Israel</HI> from Oppression &amp; Bondage in <HI>Egypt,</HI> was to be celebrated with solemn Festivity, and with the Reason of it carefully to be transmitted by divine Appointment to Posterity—<HI>And thou shalt shew thy Son in that Day, saying, This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me, when I came out of Egypt,—And it shall be for a Sign unto thee, that the Lord's Law may be in thy Mouth; thou therefore shalt keep this Ordinance.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> 13. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>And when <HI>Haman,</HI> who was of the Blood Royal of <HI>Amalck,</HI> and therefore the natural Enemy of <HI>Israel,</HI> plotted their Destruction through the whole <HI>Persian</HI> Empire, and had procur'd of <HI>Abasuarus</HI> a Decree for that Purpose; God by a very signal Interposition cast him into the Pit which he had digged, and bro't his Devices upon his own Head, but <HI>gave Joy and Gladness and a good Day unto the Jews.</HI>—Wherefore <HI>Mordecai</HI> (no Doubt by divine Direc∣tion) appointed this Preservation to be celebrated annually with Festivity and Joy on the <HI>fourteenth</HI> and <HI>fifteenth</HI> Days of the Month <HI>Adar.</HI>—This was celebrated with Thanks∣giving and Praise to GOD.—<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Esth.</HI> 9.20.&amp;c.—</NOTE></P>

<P>When <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak</HI> delivered <HI>Israel</HI> from the Oppression of <HI>Jabin</HI> King of <HI>Hazor,</HI> they in their trium∣phal Song give all the Glory unto GOD.—<HI>Praise ye the</HI> LORD <HI>for the avenging of</HI> Israel—LORD, <HI>when thou wentest out of</HI> Seir, <HI>when thou marchedst out of the Field of</HI> EDOM; <HI>the Earth trembled, and the Heavens dropped; the Mountains melted before the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of Israel—They fought from Heaven, the Stars in their Courses fought against</HI> Sifera, and the <HI>River</HI> Kishon <HI>swept them away.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Judges</HI> 5.—</NOTE></P>
<P>And when the LORD with Thunder &amp; Lightning dis∣comfitted the <HI>Philistines</HI> before his People, who persued them to the Confines of their own Country; <HI>Samuel took a Stone and set it up between</HI> Mizpeh <HI>and</HI> Shen, <HI>and called the Name of it</HI> EBENEZER, <HI>saying, Hitherto the</HI> LORD <HI>hath helped us.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7. 12.—</NOTE></P>
<P>And what shall I more say? For the Time wou'd fail me to tell of <HI>David</HI> and of <HI>Asa,</HI> and of <HI>Jehosaphat,</HI> and of <HI>Hezekias,</HI> and of other Worthies; who with the Pro∣phets and People of God, gave <HI>Him</HI> the Glory of their Pre∣servation under Affliction and in Distress from Enemies.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Reason</HI> of <HI>these Ascriptions</HI> hath always been the same, and the same Spirit of Gratitude hath rested upon the Saints of all succeeding Ages; So the <HI>Christian Church</HI> hath always given to the same GOD the Glory of her Preservation, under the numerous Evils which have been bro't upon her by her Enemies—whether Men or Devils.</P>
<P>And well may the Inhabitants of <HI>this Country</HI> join with the Church in all preceeding Times, in giving Glory to the GOD of Salvation.—</P>

For when they were few in Number, when they were far from human Help, in a howling Wilderness, and sur∣rounded with numerous <HI>Barbarians,</HI> who thirsted for their Blood, and often plotted their Destruction; <HI>GOD</HI> the <HI>GOD</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> was their Saviour—They trusted in Him, and were not ashamed—And notwithstanding all the Attempts of their Enemies, whether <HI>American,</HI> or <HI>European,</HI> are yet a growing People.</P>
<P>The Habitations of Cruelty are become a Valley of Vision—Where <HI>Satan</HI> was worshipped with horrid Rites, the GOD of Heaven is now adored—The solitary Places rejoice, the Wilderness blossometh as the Rose, and the Glory of <HI>Sharon</HI> is given unto it.—</P>
<P>Surely, it was GOD that bro't a Vine from far, cast out the Heathen before it, planted it, and caused it to take Root, and fill the Land; so that the Hills are covered with the Shadow, and the Bows thereof are like the goodly Cedars.—</P>
<P>GOD grant, that the Hedges may not be broken down, that it may never be plucked by those that pass by, that the <HI>Boar</HI> out of the <HI>Wilderness</HI> may never waste it, nor the wild Beasts devour it; but may the Glory of the LORD be upon it from Generation to Generation.—</P>
<P>But the <HI>present Assembly</HI> calls for a particular Address.—</P>
<P>Brethren, as through the good Hand of our God upon us, we this Day see the <HI>Completion</HI> of a <HI>Century</HI> from the <HI>Incorporation</HI> of <HI>the Town,</HI> and have recollected some of the signal Mercies of GOD to our Fathers under their nu∣merous Afflictions by the Enemy; we may with Propriety join with <HI>Israel</HI> of old, and say,</P>
<P><Q>If it had not been the LORD who was on our Side; if it had not been the LORD who was on our Side, when
<PB N="27" REF="007020_0030_102AE9DAD61605B0"/>
Men rose up against us; then they had swallow'd us up quick, when their Wrath was kindled against us.—Blessed be the LORD who hath not given us a Prey to their Teeth—Our Help is in the Name of the LORD</Q>—Who reigns in <HI>Zion</HI> Head over all Things unto his Church—And will Reign, till all opposing Rule, Authority and Power shall be put down, and the Time come for deliver∣ing the Kingdom unto GOD, even the FATHER, and for presenting his Church without Spot, and with exceed∣ing Joy before the Presence of his Glory.</P>
<P>As the Church was purchas'd by his own Blood, the FATHER hath in all Ages committed the Preservation of it to HIM; and as <HI>Mediator</HI> vested him with all Power in Heaven and Earth. In all the Afflictions of his Peo∣ple, he was afflicted, in his Love and in his Pity he re∣deemed them, he bare them, and carried them all the Days of old.—He was the Refuge of <HI>our</HI> Fathers in their Distresses.—Let us therefore mention the loving Kindnesses of the LORD, and the Praises of the LORD, according to all that he hath bestowed upon us—And the great Goodness towards the House of <HI>Israel,</HI> which he hath bestowed according to his Mercy, and according to the Multitude of his loving Kindnesses.</P>
<P>Let the Consideration of these Things animate us.</P>
<P N="1">1.) <HI>To a firm and unshaken Confidence in Him under all Adversity.</HI></P>
<P>This is one important End for which the merciful Ap∣pearances of GOD for our Fathers in their Distresses are to be recollected.—He commanded our Fathers that they shou'd make them known to their Children, that they might set their Hope in GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2.) <HI>Let these Things excite us to a sincere Compliance with all his Precepts, whether relating to Faith or Practice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="007020_0031_102AE9DC94731B80"/>
This also is another important Use to be made of them.—That they might set their Hope in GOD, and not forget his Works, <HI>but keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>And without a sincere Regard to divine Precepts, our Confidence will be Presumption.—For there is no Promise of Protection or Blessing to such as persevere in Disobe∣dience and Unbelief.—</P>
<P>If ye forget the Works of the LORD, and walk not in his Ways, ye may well expect to be abandon'd to all Evil.—This is evident from the History of <HI>Israel</HI>—For when <HI>Joshua</HI> and all that Generation were gathered to their Fathers; and there arose another Generation, who knew not the Works of the LORD, which he had done in <HI>Israel;</HI> They forsook the LORD GOD of their Fathers, and fol∣low'd after the Gods of the People that were round about them, and provoked the LORD to Anger—And he de∣liver'd them into the Hands of Spoilers, that spoiled them, and sold them into the Hands of their Enemies round about, so that they cou'd not stand any longer be∣fore their Enemies.—</P>
<P>Whethersoever they went out, the Hand of the LORD was against them for Evil; as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them, and they were greatly, distressed.—</P>
<P>Muse therefore on his Wonders of old, and on his Works in the Days of your Fathers, 'till the Fire shall burn within you—'till sacred Ardors shall rise in your Souls, and animate you to the most chearful Trust and Obedience.—</P>
<P>Ye are the Seed of the blessed of the LORD, and the Children of the Covenant which he made with them—
<PB N="29" REF="007020_0032_102AE9E01786D3C0"/>
Fulfil therefore the Obligations, as ye expect the Blessings of that Covenant.—Let your Hearts be stedfast in it.</P>
<P>Be ambitious of imitating whatever was excellent in your Ancestors—Consider from whence ye are fallen—Your Works are not perfect before GOD: Remember therefore how ye have received and heard, and repent—and strengthen the Things that remain &amp; are ready to die.</P>
<P>Is not this the Voice of your Fathers, <Q>And ye our Children, know ye the GOD of your Fathers, and serve him with perfect Hearts and willing Minds; if ye seek him he will be found of you, but if you forsake him he will cast you off forever.</Q>—</P>
<P>Your Fathers bare the Heat and Burden of the Day, they submitted to many Hardships &amp; Dangers; not only that they might leave unto you a fair temporal Inheri∣tance, as it is this Day; but also, what they esteem'd in∣finitely preferable, that they might leave you in the En∣joyment of the Gospel in its Purity—For the Sake of This, they ventured their Lives into this Wilderness—For This, they expos'd themselves to Perils by Sea, to Perils in the Wilderness, to Perils by the Heathen, and to various Evils.</P>
<P>And ye are risen up in your Fathers Stead; and Pros∣perity shines in full Orb upon you—Stand fast therefore in the <HI>Liberty</HI> wherewith CHRIST hath made you free.—</P>
<P>Give Commandment to your Housholds, and to your Seed after you, to walk in all the Commandments &amp; Or∣dinances of the LORD blameless, and to do Mercy and Judgment—That they also may give the same in Charge to theirs—from Generation to Generation—</P>
<P>That the divine Blessing may be upon them, and the Kingdom of GOD be advanced by them.</P>
