<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FABLES are generally pleasing to children. Since they are so; were it not more advisable to sup∣ply them with such as afford <HI>lessons</HI> suited to their age; than to waste our time in debating whether or no Fable-writing be the most desirable mode of instruc∣tion?</P>
<P>IF I were asked the question, I should answer in the negative.</P>
<P>BUT let us consider that every book the little boy meets with at school, will present to him Fables, which he will seize with avidity as novelties: Fa∣bles, the morals of which are calculated to give an improper bias to his mind; had we not then better indulge him (whilst in the nursery) with a few that convey simple Morals adapted to the duties of child∣hood? I think so; or I had not written these.</P>
<P><HI>Rousseau's</HI> remarks upon Fables, as making a part of the Library for Children,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However mistaken, however detestable, many notions of <HI>Rousseau's</HI> may be; there are useful maxims to be gleaned from his work respecting children. I wish the wheat were sepa∣rated from the chaff.</NOTE> seem to me just: most
<PB N="viii" REF="033728_0006_0FF91DE1A3356998"/>
of his objections militate strongly against all the Fables I ever met with. If I did not hope that these are exempted from his charges I would not offer them to the public, still less would I have presented them to the dear little ones for whom they were written.</P>
<P>THERE must always remain one accusation against Fables, namely, Falsehood; but surely it is easily explained to the children, that it is but their own usual favourite sport of, <HI>"making believe,"</HI> as they call feigning visits, trading, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> with no design to deceive; yet, to guard against the shadow of evil, I have been explicit on that point in some of the dialogues; lest the little books should fall into the hands of any poor friendless child, and lessen his regard to truth. Now I mention the dialogues, I confess that I am prepared for ridicule, should any but a tender mother open my volumes.</P>
<P>I WEAVE <HI>nets</HI> for <HI>insects;</HI> and if I suit my toils to my game am I to be derided? Who but stoops with satisfaction to lead an infant by the hand: Who but delights to adapt her steps to its short and unequal paces? And shall we be less tender, less indulgent to the unformed mind?</P>
<P>A JUDICIOUS mother condescends to prattle with her children; to mingle in their sports; thus she
<PB N="ix" REF="033728_0007_0FF91DE778A5ADB0"/>
infuses ideas in their tender minds, whilst she en∣gages their affections; yet without relinquishing parental authority.</P>
<P>No office is <HI>mean</HI> which concerns the health (<HI>cor∣poreal</HI> or <HI>mental</HI>) of the rising generation.</P>
<P>WHY then do I make apologies for my infantine dialogues!</P>
<P>DOES it proceed from pride? apprehensive of jests from those who are not aware of their use?</P>
<P><HI>Folly!</HI></P>
<P>THOSE who are engaged in educating an infant, will accept them with satisfaction; those who are not, (nor ever were) will despise them, and all that can be said in their excuse.</P>
<Q>NUL de nous n'est assez philosophe pour savoire se mettre à la place d'un enfant.</Q>
<P>YET those who are mothers must strive to do it; and defy the derision of such as—"never had a child."</P>

<HEAD>TO MY LITTLE READERS.</HEAD>
<P>You have been good, else your mam-ma would not have bought a new book for you.</P>
<P>I will tell you a tale. Mas-ter <HI>Brother-ton</HI> was a good child.</P>
<P>When he was three years old, he would bring his book, and learn to read.</P>
<P>He spelt the words thus, b-r-e-a-d—bread, and so on.</P>
<P>He was apt, and fond of his book.</P>
<P>One day I met with some nice, clear, large print let-ters; and I cut them out,
<PB N="xii" REF="033728_0009_0FF91DEE27C0BE18"/>
and stuck them on card; then laid them thus, c-a-t—cat, d-o-g—dog; and he said the words at sight.</P>
<P>Was not this nice?</P>
<P>Then it came in my mind to print with a pen for him; so I made tales of the dog, and the cat, and such short words—Should you not jump for joy?—He did.</P>
<P>I should have sent these to make a book for you, to learn to read in; but there is one now with a name too long for you to read <HI>(Imperial Spelling-Book:)</HI> it is full of prints, and tales in short words; so that it must be joy of a boy or girl to learn to read in it.</P>
<P>I wish I had met with such a book three or four years since: I spent a great deal of time, for want of such an one.</P>
<P>You all love a book, and are fond of prints.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="033728_0010_0FF91DEFBB5AABF0"/>
One day I bought a book of Fa-bles full of prints; but I found it was all in <HI>verse:</HI> it was sad stuff: I could not bear the Fa-bles nor the Mo-rals.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> (that was the sweet boy's name) had a great mind to know what the Hen said, and what the Ape did; yet he was so good, that he would not ask the maids to read to him; (as he knew that I did not like the book) but would look at the prints, and talk of them, and not seem to wish to read.</P>
<P>As he was so good (if you be good you will be sure to meet with things to please you) I wrote some Fa-bles in print, with my pen, to suit the prints.</P>
<P>I told him that I should not have done this, if he had not been so good.</P>
<P>Guess how full of joy he was! I think I hear you say, "I wish I could see them!"</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="033728_0011_0FF91DF222AC4820"/>
Now that is what I am in hopes you may.</P>
<P>"And will there be prints?"</P>
<P>That I can not tell: I think there will. But if there should not; yet you will be glad to have the book; you will know that there would have been some, if it had been right.</P>
<P>You must learn to take things as you find them—to take with thanks what is meant to please you; though it may not be quite what you wish.</P>
<P>I wish my book may have prints, as I know it will give you the more joy; I am glad to please a good child.</P>
<P>This was wrote to teach you to be good.</P>
<P>If you be good your friends will love you.</P>
<P>If you be good, God will bless you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>FABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>AN Ape had seen the maids roast nuts; and he had eat some, and thought they were nice.</P>
<P>So the first time he had some nuts, he had a great mind to roast them too.</P>
<P>He made a fire in the yard, it would have made you laugh to see him fetch his sticks, and his straw, and then set fire to them with a match.</P>
<P>Then he threw in his nuts, and stood to watch them.</P>
<P>Bounce! goes one: <HI>Pug</HI> gave a skip, and went to take it out; but he found it too hot for his hands.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="033728_0025_0FF91E188D258638"/>
"What can be done?" said he, "I do not care to go in for the tongs.—O! there is the Cat!—<HI>Puss!</HI> how do you do?—Will you eat a nut?</P>
<P>"I thank you," said the Cat, as she came to him.</P>
<P>"You must help me to get them out, if you please," said the Ape; and took the poor Cat in his arms: in vain did she cry out; but by good luck, the man of the house saw him, and said:</P>
<P>"Hold, <HI>Pug!</HI>—you may do as you like with your own paws,—they are of no use but to play tricks with.—My Cat makes use of her's, to catch the mice and rats, which would rob me of my corn, my bread, and my cheese."—</P>
<P><HI>Pug</HI> took a look at the Man; then he cast his eye at the nuts; then he gave a grin; still he held the Cat.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="033728_0026_0FF91E711DBE1ED8"/>
Then the man said to him:</P>
<P>"Let my Cat go—Spare her paws, and use your own; them I can well spare—but I beg you to set <HI>Puss</HI> out of your arms now;—or I will come and drub you well with this staff!"</P>

<P>"What a fine bird! plumes as black as jet, which shine so bright in the Sun that I can scarce look at them—Can you sing?—If your voice"—He would have said more, but the Crow was so vain as to set out a scream, and off ran the Fox with the meat which fell out of her beak.</P>

<P>A STAG is fierce and strong; but is in fear of a Horse, when a man is on it. We think that a Stag, in a wild state would be too much for a Horse.</P>

<P>There have been bad men who would rob a child of his cloaths.—Now a boy is no match for a man in strength.</P>
<P>But a boy who does not go out of his bounds, but keeps where he has leave to be; does not come in the way of those sort of men.</P>
<P>Thus you see, that a good boy is too hard for a bad man.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE remarked—(but who has not <HI>felt?</HI>) that the pleasure of a Fable, is damped to a child, by the tedious unintelligible Moral which is to follow.</P>
<P>A Moral, against which, perhaps, the complaint already urged, is much the smallest that might be alledged.</P>
<P>Perhaps the natural inference from it is <HI>such,</HI> that a child may be the worse for it all his life.</P>
<P>Perhaps it tends to teach him to be deceitful, trea∣cherous, covetous—but the slightest injury which I should apprehend, is a satiety and disgust at the idea of a <HI>Moral.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, having written a few Fables from whence unexceptionable Morals may be drawn, I chose to make the little folk themselves seem to dis∣cover them—indeed, I took care they should be suf∣ficiently obvious for them to do it—and the frequent repetition appeared to me to be of use, as it would enable the child really to make the remarks which I put in his mouth, as well as inculcate more strongly the notions which I wished to infuse.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHEN Mrs</HI> Teach well <HI>wrote these Fables and Morals in the year 1779, she wrote them for the use of her own family.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now they are offered to the public, perhaps it may be proper to premise, that there is another set of Fables adapted to the same prints—written for the use of an elder child—who is made to converse upon the subject (in the latter part of this little volume) by the name of</HI> George: <HI>the second set of Morals going by the name of</HI> George's <HI>Morals.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mrs.</HI> Teachwell <HI>is apprehensive that she shall be blamed for raising</HI> George's <HI>language above nature, when his early youth is considered—therefore she explains her motive—</HI></P>
<P><HI>She chose to send him to his Dictionary for an explanation of words—thinking it an excellent ex∣ercise
<PB REF="033728_0064_0FF9211D148D5270"/>
for him—Those parents who want leisure or patience to direct such an exercise can explain the words; and so make trial of the little reader's memory.</HI></P>
<P>William <HI>was then three and a half:</HI> George <HI>five years of age.</HI></P>

<P>The Hen was some-what in the si-tu∣a-ti-on of a Boy at school, urg-ed by a wick-ed school-fel-low to break the rules, or stray be-yond the bounds which are ap-point-ed. Much dis-cre-ti-on, in judg-ing of what is pro-per, is not to be ex-pect-ed from a lit-tle boy; but he may have the mo-des-ty of this Hen, to keep him from pre-tend-ing to judge—he may shew his pru-dence, by o-bey-ing the in-junc-ti-ons of his su-pe-ri-ors in age and wis-dom; with a full as-su-rance that they are found∣ed on rea-son, though he is not able to ac-ccount ex-act-ly for them. He may con-clude (as the Hen in the Fa∣ble
