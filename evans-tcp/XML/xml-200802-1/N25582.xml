<P>THE most high God, being as merciful as just, has been care∣ful in his word, to encourage, support, and comfort his peo∣ple with gracious promises, no less than to alarm, check, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ter his enemies by the most awful threats. The passage of holy writ now read is an evidence of this. The chapter from which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is taken contains a valedictory <HI>song,</HI> which Moses by the appoint∣ment of God, delivered to the Children of Israel, a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> before his death. The time was now come, for him to take his leave of that people, whom he had so long governed, comforted, and in∣structed. In this <HI>song</HI> he not only admonishes and reproves them for their ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stacy from God, but predicts the punishments which their sins would bring upon them. At the same time he promises, in the text, and context, that destruction shall eventually come upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and oppress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. As the sovereign and righte∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> ruler of the un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erse, God claims his right to inflict punitive justice upon his enemies, and with the authority of a judge, de∣clares, that <HI>in due time their foot shall slide. For their vine is of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and of the fields of Gomorrah.</HI> verse 32. The com∣mentators which I have had opportunity to consult, say, this had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the enemies of the Jewish Church, and therefore the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of judgment in the text is to be considered as made upon them.</P>
<P>But equally mindful of the righteous, God declares in the text that <HI>he will judge his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and repent himself for his servants.</HI> By which we may understand that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will not destroy the righteous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>them that are his,</HI> and will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> anger. I appears to be the meaning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the text, that God in compassion for his people, and for his own glory, will judge for them against their enemies, condescend
<PB N="6" REF="033979_0005_0FF9F3D7AF370D28"/>
to plead their cause and break the yoke of oppression under which they may groan: that, instead of visiting them in judgment as they deserve for their sinful backslidings, he will forgive, protect and save them. <HI>Repenting himself for his servants,</HI> is an expression which shows, not that God changes his purposes and is fickle like men, but that he will forgive the sins of his people and not deal with them according to their deserts. <HI>And when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and delivered them out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hand of their enemies, all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the judge; for it repented the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because of their groanings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y reason of them that oppressed them and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges ii.18.</NOTE> <HI>And God saw their works, that they turned from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them, and he did it not.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jonah iii 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Notwithstanding this denunciation of judgment, and procla∣mation of mercy had a special reference to the children of Israel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their enemies, or to the wicked and the pious of that day, still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> contained in the text, is applicable to those two cha∣ract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of men in all ages of the world▪ It was no doubt given for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to vicious men, that <HI>in due time their foot should</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a promise of comfort to the righteous, that <HI>God would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself for his people.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. We are naturally led<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the denunciation of judgment in the text, to consider the awfully alarming state of wicked, im∣pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tent men. They are constantly exposed to destruction, as one who walks on slippery ground, is every step which he takes, in danger of falling. The very manner in which destruction is to come upon them shows their continual danger. For, saith the Psalmist, <HI>surely thou didst set them in slippery places, and thou castedst them down into destruction.</HI></P>
<P>Their state is the more awful, as they are exposed to sudden and unexpected ruin. If a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enture on slippery ground, he is not only liable every moment to fall, but when his foot does slide, it is instantaneous, and he falls without warning. The reason why they have not already fallen is because God in mercy hath held them up. But in due time their foot <HI>shall</HI> slide. When they shall have proceeded in the commission of crime after crime against God and human society, till the measure of their iniquities be full, then the most high God, will in his providence, no longer hold them up in their walks upon slippery ground, where they never had any leave to venture, but let them sink under the weight of their sins into merited contempt and misery.</P>
<P>In order more fully to illustrate this truth, that impenitently
<PB N="7" REF="033979_0006_0FF9F3DDE8A4B190"/>
wicked, and immoral men will be detected and punished, let me propose the following things for consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1st. There is no want of power in God to begin the infliction of that punishment upon such persons, which they deserve, at any time, when he pleases. Feeble mortals can make no resistance against an omnipotent arm. Though earthly princes have fre∣quently found it difficult to subdue a rebel when he has fortified and made himself strong; yet no fortress nor numbers can avail any thing against almighty God. If hand join in hand, and ever so many in malevolence combine against him, they are easily bro∣ken and destroyed. They are like a rope of sand,—feeble as the chaff before a driving storm;—the driest stubble in the field, is not more easily consumed by the raging of an uncontroled fire. <HI>Be∣hold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the ballance.</HI> However easy it may be for us, to crush the worm, which crawls under our feet, upon the ground, or to cut the thread by which any thing is suspended in the air, still with infinitely more ease, the Almighty can destroy his enemies. What is man, that he should presume to think of resisting God, at whose rebuke the earth trembles, and before whom the mountains are levelled.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly. Another consideration which shows that impenitent, disobedient men, will be overtaken in their career of vice, and punished, is, that this they deserve. Such are their crimes against God and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that they deserve, and have reason to expect this, as a reward for their evil deeds. That justice to which a holy God must always have a sacred regard, will not stand in the way; nor be any objection to his executing vengeance upon them. But deserving punishment, justice will rather demand that they should suffer. To every tree in the garden, which bringeth forth the fruit of Sodom and Gomorrah, the language of justice, is, <HI>cut it down; why cumbereth it the</HI> ground? Being under the sentence of condemnation, the sword of justice already hangs over their heads. The law of God, which he has established as a rule of righteous∣ness, condemns them; for <HI>he that believeth not is condemned already.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3rdly. It is a consideration of importance that impenitent, dis∣obedient men, are now under the very same <HI>kind</HI> of divine displea∣sure, as God exercises towards those whom he punishes in the re∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns of despair. The reason why, by human laws they are not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tected, and condemned, is not because God is unoffended at their crimes: The reason why they do not immediately sink down into misery, is no proof of their innocence. Perhaps the divine being is now more displeased with them, than with some, who for thousands of years have been suffering in <HI>the place of torment.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="033979_0007_0FF9C93A30C1EF00"/>
For some now living, not only may be impenitent, but much more guil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y: and though God's displeasure will be made much more manifest in the future than in the present world, yet, his displeasure is always in proportion to the creature's criminality.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding there are some hardened persons who think themselves safe in continuing a vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious course, because less-guil∣ty in their opinion than their companions, yet they ought to con∣fide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that they may now be much more criminal than some who have long since perished, and therefore are under the greater displea∣sure of God. But if guilty in a greater or less degree, as God hateth iniquity, their misery s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbereth not: as he loves the jus∣tice of his law, though for the present they be permitted to escape the vigilant attempts of human society to detect them, still God hath opened a pit of destruction under their foot, into which in due time they must fall.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Still further to illustrate the truth, that impenitent, vicious men must fall in due time, let me suggest, that they have nothing on which to depend for safety, protection, and sal∣vation. If the thief, the murderer, the man of lewdness, or any other sinner, should see nothing which is likely in his opinion, to be the means or his detection and punishment: this however is no evidence but there are means now operating which will speedily bring his works of darkness to light, unto his utter confusion and ruin. It is reasonable to suppose, that as God has appointed the end, he has also appointed the means. If a man walk on slip∣pery ground, he must be blind, not to see his danger and the means which are likely to effectuate his fall. To bring this to pass, there is no need of a miracle, or that any thing extraordina∣ry should take place. It is in vain that they cry peace, and safe∣ty; for the highest authority has long since assured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that to the wicked there is no peace.</P>
<P>Their own care, cunning and secret artifice, or the most dili∣gent precaution and vigilance of others can be no certain security to them. Self-conceited, and worldly-wise men are often taken in their own craftiness. Remaining imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nitent, men of this cha∣racter, go from sin to sin, and by hal it in an evil course, become hardened and alike insensible to their guilt and their dan∣ger. But were they to be ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r so vigilant to avoid de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction, will not an over-ruling providence in time drag them forth from their lurking places, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the murderer, the robber of the purse, and the destroyer of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man justice, or, by s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me other mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, send <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forward to the more enlightened, the more perfect, and the more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of heaven? I will be in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pray a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d petition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>in due time</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="033979_0008_0FF9F3E7DF16E878"/>If through the cunning devices and contrivances of friends, they should be protected, defended and saved for a time, this however must be temporary; for it is a course which tends to ruin, and sooner or later must end in ruin. Could they use any art, vigi∣lance, secrecy, or contrivance, which would be an impregnable bulwark against their detection and punishment,—fools might be accounted wise, and wise men, fools,—fools would live, and wise men die. But it is a happy circumstance, that nature has fur∣nished wicked men with no irresistable weapons of defence. Ei∣ther the laws of men, or the providence of God, will in due time bring them to condign punishment. <HI>The simple pass on and are punished.</HI></P>
<P>These sons of vice, these enemies to God and men, can find no promise of their maker, to preserve them for a moment from de∣tection and an ignominious death. Pursuing a wicked course, and continuing impenitent, they can find no more safety in God, than in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn contrivances of defence. God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laid himself un∣der no obligation, by promise, to pretect and preserve them for a moment, from a punishment which their conduct seems to defy. To those who have searched the scriptures, it is well known, that God has made no promises of forgiveness and eternal life, or none of deliverance and preservation from eternal death, which are not contained in the covenant of grace; and in the promises of this covenant, it must also be known, that no wicked men can take re∣fuge, for they are made on the conditions of repentance and faith, of which persons of this character are entirely destitute.</P>
<P>If the hypocrite travel the round of internal duty—if the knave and the thief pretend to honesty and uprightness—if the murderer and man of lewdness appear harmless as the lamb, or if the whole group of vicious characters should attend upon the appointed means of instruction and grace,—yet all this will not enable them to take refuge in the promises of the Gospel, because they are still impeni∣tent and unbelieving. Like the practical atheist and the villain among men, they cannot, upon seeing that their own care, vigi∣lance, and contrivances are weak and likely to fail, fly to any di∣vine promise for safety and protection. Before this can be done by any description of men there must be a sincere and cordial com∣pliance with the conditions of the covenant of grace. <HI>For whosoe∣ver believeth and is babtized shall be saved; but whosoever believeth not shall be damned.</HI></P>
<P>Again. There are reigning in the souls of impenitent, disobe∣dient men, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se viole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, inflammatory and evil principles, which would pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntly destroy them, were they not restrained by the grace of God. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere it not for this restraint, it is impossible to con∣ceive,
<PB N="10" REF="033979_0009_0FF9F3ECCF5E4F98"/>
what violence, what malignity what e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mity, what strife, what remorse, what intense misery, sinful principles rooted in the depraved heart of man, might produce. From effects however which we have seen, where the restrain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of God have been only partially taken off, we have the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st solemn and alarming reason to dread, abhor, and to the utmost extremity, resist, the operation of sinful principles, in the heart of man. Such persons not only have nothing on which they can rely for safety and salvation, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are charged with principles, which are hosti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to themselves and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iety, and are too often actually productive of confusion and ev∣ery evil work. If Amnon vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iated the chastity of Tamar his sister —if Cain s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew his brother—if Judas betrayed his saviour—and others innumerable have committed the most attr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ious crimes, when only <HI>some</HI> of the divine restraints were taken off, to what lengths would sinful principles carry then, and into what depths of misery plunge them, were they entirely given up to pursue their own corrupt inclinations! Those, who wish to know, will do well to consult Robison's "proofs of conspiracy against religion and government," and carefully peruse those writers who have given a correct history of the revolution in France. By these means they will see human nature in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s worst light; and to what dan∣gerous and destr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctive lengths sinful principles will impe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> depra∣ved man, when he feareth not God, nor regardeth human law.</P>

deeds. <HI>The day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY. <HI>God shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants.</HI> That he will judge his people is matter of great conso∣lation. For it implies that in mercy to them, as well as for the support of his own government, he will detect and punish the wicked. <HI>And Joshua said; why hast thou troubled us? The L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall trouble thee this day.</HI> The troublers of God's people shall be troubled: <HI>in due time their foot shall slide.</HI> Experience confirms the truth of this. Under the Jewish dispensation, it is well known, that God appeared in a very remarkable manner for his people, during a great length of time. In many particular instances, he interposed, and cut off these of their enemies, who threatened and troubled them. To all who have examined the history of the Christian church, it must be equally evident, that God has conti∣nued to judge his people, even to the present day. <HI>The gates of hell</HI> have not <HI>and shall not prevail against his church.</HI></P>
<P>But he not only judges <HI>for</HI> his people, in protecting them as an Almighty Guardian, against external and internal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oes to their peace and well being, but in forgiving their back<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lidings and say∣ing them from the fatal consequences of sin. <HI>He repenteth him∣self for his servants.</HI> Upon those who repent of their sins and embrace the way of salvation which he has opened, by the death of his Son, he will shew mercy, forgive and save them. <HI>None that trust in him shall be des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate.</HI></P>
<P>It is true there is a sense in which even those may fall. The sins of God's people may involve them in great troubles in the present life, but as <HI>God repenteth himself for his servants,</HI> who ex∣ercise that love and obedience in kind which are required in the divine law, so happiness without end, and complete, will be their portion in the world to come. <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath prepared for them that love him.</HI></P>
<P>It is a most pleasing reflection, that even the murderer, the thief, the man of lewdness, may become the people of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>he will judge, and for whem he repenteth himse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. For the Son of God was set forth to be a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pitiation for our sins, and not for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only, but for the sins of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> world.</HI> He died as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>if, as for the least of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inners.

<HI>perish. He that believeth on</HI> PIM, <HI>is not condemned.</HI> These quali∣fications are essential. If they be obtained merely by the exertion and striving of the creature, or if by the efficacy of appointed means of instruction and grace—or if they be given to the sinner with∣out any solicitude, or a single thought or act of his, they never∣theless on each of these schemes are equally necessary. <HI>If ye be∣lieve not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</HI></P>
<P>To those in whom these qualifications are found, God will be a Judge, a Father, and a Saviour, without any regard to what their character had been, previous to their conversion. If their sins have been many, aggravated, public, or private, he will up∣on their repentance and faith; preserve, acquit, forgive, and save them from the misery of hell, to which their sins have tended. For by these qualifications, men become the people and servants of God. Whatever a profession of religion, and a constant observ∣ance of divine institutions may do, in making men the people of God, in the eyes of their fellow creatures, or in preparing them for piety and holiness, yet they are not favored with the promise of God to forgive and save them from eternal death, without re∣pentance for sin, and faith in the Redeemer. <HI>There is no other name given under heaven by which m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n must be saved</HI>; nor in this name of Christ, can the righteous or the most pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igate sinner be justified and accepted, without a <HI>contrite heart,</HI> and <HI>faith in the Son of God.</HI> And all who exercise these christian graces and qualifica∣tions for heaven will manifest themselves to be the people of God, in a full and entire reliance on the work of Christ as the matter of their justification, and in a careful observance of divine institu∣tions and precepts. For <HI>faith worketh by love,</HI> and therefore <HI>is not dead,</HI> but productive of good fruit.</P>
<P>How glorious is the work of redemption! How wonderful in its invention, execution, and effects! It is most happily calculated to humble the sinner and redound to the glory of God: to open the divine character to the view of men, to bring them into the practice of virtue, and unitedly to secure both the honorable sup∣port of the government of God, and the happiness of the penitent sinner.—The plan and work of redemption is also infinitely be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evolent in its effects. Adam after he had sinned, and before he had a revolution of this mercy, retired to an obscure pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> garden, <HI>there</HI> to hide himself from the presence of his Maker Self-c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>mned and feelingly guilty, he feared to meet his Judge.

and faith, would not have brought them the pleasing hope of forgiveness and salvation. But, in boundless love, unto those who <HI>sat in darkness and the shadow of death,</HI> Christ was given to enlighten, comfort and save. <HI>In him God is reconciling the world unto himself. God will judge his people and repent himself for his servants.</HI></P>
<P>A careful review of what has been said in this discourse▪ will on the one hand shew the tendency of sin, and the awful ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger of those who continue in their vicious courses; and on the other, the advantages and everlasting blessings to be derived from peni∣tence, reformation and virtue. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages of sin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. We unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him; for the reward of his han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s shall be given him. But, say ye to the righteous, it shall be well with him▪ for thee shall eat of the fruit of their doings.</HI></P>
<P>The strongest motives are placed before impenitent, disobedient men, to forsake every wicked and false way, and to return unto the Lord, who will have mercy upon them, and to God in Christ who will abundantly forgive. But if they hearken not to Moses and the Prophets, neither would they be persuaded, were one to rise from the dead, and preach the very same truths, hold out the very same threats, and offer the very same promises of pardon and felicity, which have already been presented to them by the pro∣phets, and apostles, Jesus Christ being the chief-corne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stone. Herein, the murderer, the thief, the lecher, and many others, show that they are neither friends to their God, nor their fellow men, nor themselves. Against such enemies, the providence of God, and the laws of men will conspire to detect and punish: Their only hope of escape must be in repentance and reformation. May this hope, lead them to seek these peaceable, holy and saving qualifications.</P>
<P>We cannot but congratulate men of piety and religion that they stand on such a solid and immovable foundation. <HI>The Lord will judge his people, and repent himself for his servants.</HI> If the rain de∣scend, if the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat against such a foundation, it will not give way, because laid upon a rock, even the rock of ages.</P>
<P>There are the most powerful arguments to be drawn from love, from past experience, and the hope of future safety, to excite them to deny every fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shly lust, and to live soberly and righteous¦ly, studying the things which make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r peace and whereby one may edify another. <HI>May their fruit be unto holiness and the end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting life.</HI></P>

<P>ANTHONY: it is by your request that I speak on this occasion and this is the last address which I shall ever make to you. From the sentence pronounced upon you by the court, and from the pre∣parations with which you are surrounded, you must see that you have but a very, <HI>very</HI> short time to live. Your situation is truly deplora∣ble. Whatever your crimes may have been against God and human society, yet seeing your present condition, I pity you as a man, I pray for you as a christian, and am now to address you as a minister, of the Gospel. I must therefore be faithful, and use great plain∣ness of speech.</P>
<P>The awful situation, ANTHONY, to which you are reduced, is a striking illustration of the evil nature and tendency of sin, which in this discourse I have endeavoured to explain, and set in ajust, and affecting point of light. You are one of those that have lived con∣trary to the dictates of your conscience, contrary to the plain and explicit commands of your God, and to the advice and laws of your fellow-men. Your life has been impenitently disobedient and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in∣grantly pernicious. But to say nothing of your other vices, which you have confessed and lamented, you have committed a crime, for which the punishment is death. Of this you have been con∣victed. Your guilt is aggravated. It must have been known to you, as you were educated and have lived in a christian land, that the crime of which you are convicted, was a violation of the law of God and man. Having lived where the means of information were within your own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each, you cannot now come forward and plead ignorance as an excuse.

And there is no more reason to doubt, but repentance and faith are necessary in order to the sinner's acceptance on the ground of his atonement; not as a work of the law,—not as a meritori∣ous act, nor in order to make any further atoning sacrifice; but as the absolute, indispensable conditions, on which p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdon and eternal life, are in the gospel, offered to the sinner.

<P>BRETHREN and FRIENDS:</P>
<P>The business on which we are this day convened, is of the most solemn and awful nature:—to see, one of our fellow-men, and fellow sinners, receive the just recompence of his crimes. Be∣hold, in the prisoner before you, the miserable tendency and end of a vicious course. <HI>His foot has slid in due time.</HI> In this sorrow∣ful spectacle, see, as in a glass, the vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, the debasing, the shame∣ful nature of sin; how low it may reduce men, and then leave them exposed to public shame and justice, helpless and forlorn.</P>
<P>If only such crimes be committed by any of you as by our laws are not punishable with death, yet you must be sensible that the smallest indulgence in sin subjects men to the condemnation of God's law. <HI>Cursed is every one, that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</HI> Think not fi∣nally to escape, without repentance and reformation, neither be∣cause undetected you have aleady gone great lengths in sin, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> because your crimes, if known, do not subject you to a shameful death. The natural tendency of all sin is to ruin. It is owing to the restraining grace of God, that we have not been destroyed by iniquity. What but the restraining grace of God, has made us to differ, in our present situation, from the unhappy prisoner▪ What is it owing to but this, that we have not committed the most enormous crimes, become "spectacles to the world, loaded with chains, and brought forth the prisoners of justice,' to suffer as ma∣lefactors. Were it not for the restraint, "the embargo, which God puts upon men's lusts," their wickedness would constitute a hell upon earth.</P>
<P>If you would have God for your judge, <HI>who repenteth himself fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his servants,</HI> to defend, forgive and bless you, with penitent hearts forsake every wicked and false way. If one sin be retained and indulged, it will lead to the commission of others. There are few solitary sins. To the man of an unsanctified heart, the transition is exceeding easy from lying to profane swearing, thence to sab∣bath-breaking, thence to gambling, pil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ering, stealing, and finally to the commission of murder. The transition in the crime of lewd∣ness, from little to great, is alike easy, and almost unavoidable. It is a career, which if a man begin, he is likely to pursue, if not to detection and punishment among men, yet to the infinite detri∣ment of others, and the ruin of his own soul. Avoid every thing which leads to a comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment of this unhallowed and destruc∣tive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>areer: <HI>its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ sharp as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-edged

Mortify every lust. Learn from the Apostle's advice to possess your vessels in sanctification and honour. It ought to be matter of humiliation and regret before God, unto all who have made any approaches toward this forbidden, dangerous, and fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l ground. Retreat in time; fly from it as from the shoals of death. There is little reason perhaps to hope that those who have en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered upon this forbidden ground, being hedged in by the briars and thorns which it produces, will ever retire and forsake it; still they are to be informed, as a motive to their repentance and reforma∣tion, that to <HI>God belongeth vengeance and recompence, and in due time their foot shall slide.</HI></P>
<P>Before I conclude, let me entreat you, my hearers, to pity, and pray for this poor criminal, that God would be pleased to grant him repentance and the remission of his sins. That, notwithstand∣ing justice will suffer him no longer to live, yet that he may find mercy with God through the merits of Christ, and be made meet for the inheritance of saints in light. Believing it consistent with the plan of divine mercy in the redemption of men, for God to save him, if truly penitent, you can pray for him as his distressing condition requires. Go not to the place of execution merely to see an awful, unusual exhibition, and to gratify vain curiosity; but whatever injury the criminal may have done you, or others, now pity and forgive him: leave him indeed to fall a vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tim to the just laws of our country▪ but lend him the aid of your fervent prayers in the tribulation and agony of his last moments.</P>
<P>My hearers: this occasion naturally leads our views forward to the great day of judgment; when, at the sound of the last trump, the dead shall rise, and there shall be an assembled world before the bar of God. A day, which will be glorious and joyful to the saints, <HI>for the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants,</HI> saying, <HI>come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom pre∣pared for you from the foundation of the world.</HI> But a day, which will be terrible to the wicked and finally impenitent, for <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord belongeth veng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance and recompen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who <HI>will say unto thee on the left hand, depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pa∣red for the devil and his angels.</HI> By the grace of God, may w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be prepared in that day to give up our accounts with joy, throgh our LORD JESUS CHRIST.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is something peculiarly awful in every thing that re∣lates to death and eternity. It is affecting to attend the dy∣ing bed of one of our fellow mortals when the connexion which subsists between the body and the soul is dissolved by the prevalence of any of those diseases to which human nature is subject.—But you have now before you in the person of this poor criminal, some∣thing still more awful and affecting. In strong health and the prime of life, when by the regular discharge of those duties in∣cumbent upon us as men living in a social compact, he might make himself useful to society and contribute to his own and the happi∣ness of others, he is about to fall a victim to the just laws of his country and to exhibit a solemn warning of the issue of the degenerate pas∣sions▪ of the human heart, uncontroled by reason or religion. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of us mourn the man, whilst we acquiesce in the justice of his sentence, and the propriety of is execution.</P>
<P>It is an acknowledged truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there is a God who is the cre∣ator and governor of the world, who superintends all the concerns of nations and individuals—In all his plenitude of almighty power he does according to his pleasure amongst the armies of heaven, and according to his will amongst the inhabitants of the earth: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> power is in divine consistency with his other perfections of un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rring wisdom, inflexible justice, and boundless love. In the go∣vernment of God a strict attention has been paid to rewards and punihments; by which nations and individuals are led to virtue by alurement, and from vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by fear.</P>
<P>It is necessary therefore both to the constitution and preservation of ommunities, that they are under the guidance of an alwise and almghty ruler, and <HI>that</HI> government is the best constituted which m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nearly resembles the divine.</P>

The laws of our country are a bul∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ark against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epredation, and a strong tower of defence against all attempts upon our comforts and our lives.</P>
<P>What God formerly said of the patriarchs, the law of America saith of every one of you, yea more, of every limb of every one of you,—Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm. Your property little or much, your domestic enjoyments more or less, are all g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ded by the law.</P>
<P>In most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> countries the life of a subject is at the will of his lord; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing is attempted against the life of a citizen, without an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pen and fair trial: Evidences are required to make out the charge, and the utmost deliberatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is used by those impar∣tial judges of the fact, called jurors, before they deliver their ver∣dict. If that verdict go to a declaration of the guilt of the criminal and he be adjudged worthy of death, the execution of the just judgment of the law is deferred for a considerable time, that op∣portunity may be had for the important purposes of prayer and instruction, of faith and repentance.</P>
<P>The spiritual concerns of unhappy culprits in other coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ended to with that diligence with which they are here; neither is there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime for the purpos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being more sum∣mary.
