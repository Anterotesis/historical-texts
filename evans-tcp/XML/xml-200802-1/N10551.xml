<BIBL>ROMANS XII. 18.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JESUS CHRIST, the author and sinisher of our faith, is stiled, <Q>the prince of peace.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa, ix. 6.</NOTE> He left the glories of the heaven∣ly state, and assumed our nature, that he might restore peace on earth.</P>
<P>As the mediator between GOD and a revolt∣ed world, he made satisfaction for sin by his obedience and death:—Having finished the work which was given him to do, before he ascended on high, he gave particular orders that the tidings of peace should be published to every creature; and the ministers of reli∣gion in all generations, are bound by the laws
<PB N="6" REF="013371_0004_0F90F3DEEF67D188"/>
of their divine master, to beseech the children of men to be reconciled to GOD, and be at peace with one another.—The disciples of CHRIST are commanded to "follow after the things which make for peace";<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. XIV. 12,</NOTE> and if it be possible, as much as lieth in them, to live peaceable with all men.</P>
<P>THE text supposes indeed there may be cases in which it is <HI>impossible,</HI> even for a christian to live peaceably in the present world—There may be cases in which the prince of peace himself does not require the subjects of his go∣vernment to be quiet, and tamely submit to insults and abuses.—There may be cases in which a christian ought to unsheath the sword and <HI>resist unto blood.</HI></P>
<P>THE followers of JESUS CHRIST are to be of a forgiving and peaceful temper of mind: But christians have natural rights as well as other men, and it can be no less their duty to de∣fend those rights against the encroachments of tyrants and oppressors, after having professed their subjection to the Son of GOD, than it was before. The character of a christian then, and that of a soldier are not in the least in∣consistent with each other.—In this world of disorder and injustice, a christian may, and ought to learn the art of war.</P>
<P>IN discoursing from the words before us, I in∣tend by divine assistance, to consider the import of St. Paul's exhortation;—To point out some
<PB N="7" REF="013371_0005_0F90F3E28D858088"/>
cases in which it is impossible for the disciples of CHRIST to live peaceably with <HI>all men,</HI>—And then show the necessity of preparing for un∣avoidable war.</P>
<P>FIRST then I am to consider the import of St. Paul's exhortation in the text.</P>
<P>BY this exhortation we are taught, that the professors of christianity are not to incroach on the rights of their fellow men, or pro∣voke them to war by injuring them in their name, their person, or estates. And farther, this exhortation teaches us to be of a patient and forgiving temper of mind, rather choosing to submit to many inconveniencies, than to seek the immediate destruction of our ene∣mies.—This selfdenying and pacific disposition was discovered to great advantage by the Apos∣tle Paul. Altho' he could assert his rights and priviledges with firmness and resolution on pro∣per occasions, he made it his general studdy to live in peace, and repeatedly charged his bre∣thren to be careful in all their behaviour, that they gave no just occasion of offence.—We may not attempt to deprive our brethren of <HI>any</HI> of their rights:—We may give "<HI>none</HI> offence".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 2. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND this doctrine is perfectly agreable to the dictates of reason.—I have naturally as good a right to life and liberty as my neighbour. If
<PB N="8" REF="013371_0006_0F90F3E7E1CA5848"/>
he attempts to deprive me of what I have a right to, unless it be proved I have forfeited that right he attempts to do me an injury, and unjustly provokes me to war in my own defence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lock on Government, Chap. III. <HI>of the state of war.</HI></NOTE> My neighbour can have no more right to compel me to serve him, or to de∣prive me of my possessions because he is fur∣nished with a longer sword, or a stronger arm, than I have to seek his life in the most in∣sidious manner, or rob him of his substance when he is under no apprehensions of danger.</P>
<P>THIS reasoning which every one sees the force of when applied to individuals in a state of nature, holds good with respect to the nations and kingdoms of the world.—A strong nation has no more right to oppress a weak one, than a man of large bones and strong muscels has to beat and abuse his brother, who happens to be of a more slender make.</P>
<P>IT is then evident that offensive war is un∣just.—That nation which unprovoked, makes war upon others, only to inlarge its dominions, or increase its revenues, is a nation of rob∣bers; and it would be as impossible to justify their conduct by reason or the word of GOD, as it would be to justify the conduct of a pub∣lic highway-man, or those <HI>Arabs</HI> who make it their business to plunder such unhappy travellers as fall in their way.</P>
<P>How shockingly then have many famous commanders prostituted the art of war, and
<PB N="9" REF="013371_0007_0F90F3E8091DA228"/>
polluted their hands with blood! Alexander the great, who carried his arms through the world, though possessed of uncommon military skill, is a character which ought to be held in abhorrence. His ambition led him to violate the plainest rules of Justice: He spread desolation through the finest countries, and slaughtered vast multitudes who ventured to oppose his arbitrary conduct.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One murder made a villain, "Millions a HERO"—PORTEUS.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT however much some pagan monarchs, and others who have professed the religion of JESUS may have abused their power to oppress and in∣slave those kingdoms which were unable to resist them, it is certain the light of nature, and the inspired writings teach the children of men to treat one another in a very different manner.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY teaches us to be contented with the allotments of divine providence, and forbids our looking with an envious eye on the posses∣sions of others.—The doctrines of christianity are opposed to those lusts,—such as pride, ambition, a desire of large possessions and dominion over others, which are the source of wars and fightings.</P>
<P>BUT although the gospel breathes the most kind and benevolent spirit, it is plain from many passa∣ges in the new-testament, that the sacred writers supposed it possible, and very probable, that christi∣ans may be in such circumstances as would justify their contending with their enemies.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Much to our purpose are those words of our Lord, Luk. xxii. 36.—"He that hath no Sword, let him sell his garment and buy one".</NOTE> The condi∣tions
<PB N="10" REF="013371_0008_0F90F3E8C0B20E08"/>
of peace proposed to them may be hard and unrea∣sonable. They may be of such a nature as to render it impossible for them to comply without transgressing the revealed will of heaven. Hence St. Paul says, <Q>as much as <HI>lieth in you,</HI> live pea∣ceably with all men;</Q> plainly supposing it may not be in our power to live peaceably with <HI>some</HI> men under some particular circumstances without offending GOD, or greatly injuring ourselves.—The enemies of religion may require us to deny our LORD and Master, or to do other things which we know are in themselves sinful, as the condition of life, or deliverance from oppression. In such cases it would not be in our <HI>power</HI> to live peaceably; and we should rather choose to risque our fortunes, and all we possess in a struggle with our enemies, than submit to their pleasure.</P>
<P>BUT what we have now observed will be more fully illustrated as we proceed, according to what was proposed in the,</P>
<P>SECOND place, to point out some particular cases in which it is impossible, even for the pro∣fessors of christianity, to live peaceably with <HI>all</HI> men.</P>
<P>IN this place it may be well for us to observe, the kingdom of CHRIST is a kingdom of <HI>righte∣ousness,</HI> as well as of Peace and Joy of the holy GHOST;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 17.</NOTE> and those who expect, either present or everlasting happiness in the protection and friendship of our glorious Redeemer, must never think of securing peace with their fellow men, at the expence of truth and Justice. The righteous
<PB N="11" REF="013371_0009_0F90F3E97046AC50"/>
LORD loveth righteousness, and hateth the work∣ers of iniquity: It is therefore much safer for his people to trust in him for deliverance from their enemies, than it would be for them to set∣tle a peace on unrighteous terms.—Keeping this in view, it will no doubt appear to us all, there may be cases, in which, so far from its being du∣ty to live peaceably with our fellow men, we ought to enter into war with them.</P>
<P>WERE we in a part of the world, where the laws of society had not obtained, we might, no doubt fortify our dwellings, and defend our per∣sons and substance against such as should venture to molest or destroy us. The patriarch Abram kept up a kind of militia: He had three hun∣dred and eighty trained servants, who were al∣ways ready to defend his family and interest. These faithful troops he marched against the four kings who had captivated his nephew <HI>Lot,</HI> and by managing them in the most advantageous manner, he rescued his kinsman, and slew his enemies.</P>
<P>THAT GOD approved of Abram's conduct is evident from the blessing of <HI>Melchizedic,</HI> who was a priest of the most high GOD. <Q>And he bles∣sed him and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high GOD possessor of heaven and earth. And blessed be the most high GOD which hath deli∣vered thine enemies into thy hand.</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Genesis, xiv. 19 &amp; 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS instance may serve as a sufficient proof that it is right in the sight of GOD for indivi∣duals in a state of nature, or in those parts of
<PB N="12" REF="013371_0010_0F90568F50EEB398"/>
the world where the laws of society are not esta∣blished, to defend themselves, and make war on such as attempt to deprive them of their lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>AND as the laws of reason and of GOD would Justify an individual in the case now supposed, who should defend himself against such neigh∣bours as attempted essentially to injure him, so is it equally plain, that public Societies, Provin∣ces and Kingdoms, confederated on any general plan for their safety and happiness, may and ought to defend themselves; and when their safety requires it, they may justly make war with the known enemies of their common good, whe∣ther those enemies happen to be foreign or do∣mestic.</P>
<P>WHEN people enter into society the great ob∣ject they have in view is the public good, which includes the good of individuals.—All the laws which they establish, are, or ought to be calcu∣lated for the security of the lives and proper∣ties of the whole community.</P>
<P>WHEN the community therefore is attacked by other powers, or any individuals of their bo∣dy are injured in their persons or properties, the laws of society require them to exert the powers they have for the common safety, and the safety of individuals.</P>
<P>BUT however Just and equal a right indivi∣duals in a state of nature, or particular Nati∣ons and Kingdoms where the laws of society are
<PB N="13" REF="013371_0011_0F90F3EA392326C8"/>
established, may have to life, their liberties and properties, it is certain, the rich and powerful, in all ages, have oppressed and tyrannized over the weak and defenceless.</P>
<P>So little attention has been paid to the law of righteousness, which was at first ingraven on the human heart, that the monarchs of the earth <HI>in ge∣neral</HI> have not scrupled to seize on the domini∣ons and fortunes of such as were not able to op∣pose them.—Whoever looks over the history of the world, will find undeniable proof of what we have here asserted.</P>
<P><Q>So I returned, says King Solomon, and considered all the oppressions that are done un∣der the Sun: And behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comfor∣ter: And on the side of their oppressors <HI>there was power,</HI> but they had no comforter.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. iv. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>WE can scarcely form a conception of any state more completely wretched, than that of those un∣happy mortals who lie at the mercy of absolute Sovereigns, whose word is the law, at whose nod the subjects tremble, and who may, when they please, take the life or property of any who be∣long to their dominions.</P>
<P>ABSOLUTE dominion should not be sought, or if sought, should not be given to any descendant of Adam.—It belongs to the LORD of nature, and to him alone to rule his creatures with uncontro∣led sway.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="013371_0012_0F90F3EBACFD22B8"/>
BUT as long experience has effectually taught us, that the sons of men are constantly seeking to inlarge their power and influence by oppressing their brethren, it becomes all public bodies, when they enter into society, to fortify themselves a∣gainst the encroachments of their neighbours. And whenever attempts are made on their lives, their properties or liberties, and they find it is not in their power, on just and honourable terms, to live peaceably, they may lawfully draw the sword upon their enemies.</P>
<P>How far one nation may punish the insolence and abuses they have received from another, it is somewhat difficult to say.—When those who have received injuries, and were unwillingly pro∣voked to war become conquerors, they show a greatness of mind in the exercise of mercy. But while they spare the lives of those who fall into their hands, no doubt they may demand satis∣faction for the injuries they have suffered, and require an assurance of a peaceable behaviour for the time to come.</P>
<P>THERE are two more cases, I would beg leave to mention in which wars may be justified on equitible terms.—The first is, when the subjects, or any considerable number of them rebel against those rulers who act up to the spirit and origi∣nal design of the constitution they are under.—The second is, when those who are in govern∣ment violate the laws they had sworn to main∣tain, and attempt to oppress and inslave the peo∣ple whom they had sworn to protect.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013371_0013_0F90F3EBD1CB34D0"/>
IN those parts of the world where civil govern∣ment is not established, the inhabitants, no doubt have a right to continue in a state of nature as long as they please. One individual can have no right to <HI>compel</HI> another to submit to his authority. And therefore <Q>when men enter into society it must be by voluntary consent, and they have a right to demand and insist upon the perfor∣mance of such conditions, and previous limi∣tations as form an equitable <HI>original Compact.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See LOCK on Government. VOTES and PROCEEDINGS of the Town of <HI>Boston</HI> 1772.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS being the foundation of civil government as distinguished from that tyrannical dominion which the strong have usurped over the weak, it is evident the <HI>powers</HI> of those invested with au∣thority, and the <HI>duties</HI> of the subjects in general, must be expressed in the original compacts.—These compacts which lie in the foundation of all civil societies, may not be disturbed: A single article may not be altered but with the consent of the whole body.—Whoever makes an alter∣ation in the established constitution, whether he be a <HI>subject</HI> or a <HI>ruler,</HI> is guilty of treason: Trea∣son of the worst kind: Treason against the state:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>TREASON. An offence committed against the dignity and majesty of the <HI>common-wealth.</HI></Q>—<BIBL>JOHNSTON'S DICTIONARY.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>TREASON is defined to be an offence committed against the security of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Kingdom.</HI></Q>—<BIBL>EVERY MAN HIS OWN LAWYER.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>To extend the Governor's right to command, and subject's duty to obey, beyond the laws of ones country, is treason against the constitution, and treachery to the society whereof we are mem∣bers. <HI>Glanvil</HI> who was a learned lawyer and chief Justice in <HI>Henry</HI> the second's days.—informs us that there was in his time such a thing as high Treason against the <HI>Kingdom.</HI></Q> <BIBL>LORD SOMER'S</BIBL></P>
<P>Gov. Hutchinson in his history of the Massachusets Bay. Vol. 1. P.442 informs us, the fathers of this province, in their an∣cient Body of Laws made <HI>conspiracy to invade their own common wealth, or any treacherous perfidious attempt to alter and subvers fundamentally the frame of their polity and Gover∣ment, a</HI> CAPITAL OFFENCE.</P></NOTE> For such treason many rulers as well as subjects have lost their heads.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="013371_0014_0F90F3EC746106F0"/>
CIVIL Government being founded on compact, those who are invested with authority, have certain <HI>rights</HI> which may not be invaded, while they keep within the limits prescribed them, and are the ministers of GOD for good to the people who appointed them.—Such rulers have an un∣doubted right to an honourable support.—As they devote their time to the service of the people, it may resonably be expected they will make provision for them suitable to their rank. But it must be remembered the <HI>people</HI> are to Judge what shall be given; for, although rulers may think they deserve more than the people seem willing to grant, less damages would accrue to the public, from their withholding, in some cases, those grants which they <HI>ought</HI> to make, than from putting it in the power of rulers to seize on the property of the subjects at pleasure.</P>
<P>THOSE rulers who take from the people what they please under the notion of a reward for their services, are <HI>tyrants,</HI> and the people are <HI>Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>AND further, while those who are in govern∣ment act up to the spirit and design of the con∣stitution
<PB N="17" REF="013371_0015_0F9056909C0EA1E8"/>
they are under, they have a right to demand obedience: And when any number of Subjects break their oath of allegiance, and rise in rebellion against lawful authority, the rulers, assisted by such as adhere to them and the origi∣nal constitution, may Justly make war with the rebels, and endeavour to reduce them.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine is agreeable to the practice of the ancient Jews in their best and purest state, as well as that of the most inlightened modern nati∣ons.</P>
<P>AND the same principles which would justify <HI>rulers,</HI> assisted by those who adhere to them in making war upon rebellious subjects, will jus∣tify the <HI>people</HI> in making war upon rebellious <HI>rulers.</HI></P>
<P>It is an undoubted truth that the laws of eve∣ry well constituted society, nation, or state, are above Kings,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Those who flatter the King that he is above the <HI>law,</HI> do most notoriously contradict one of the first axioms of our regal government, which is, <HI>Lex facit Regem;</HI> and he hath originally subjected himself to the law by his <HI>Coronation Oath.</HI></Q><BIBL>LORD SOMMERS.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>The exceeding the bounds of authority is no more a right in a <HI>Great,</HI> than a petty officer, no more justifiable in a <HI>King</HI> than a <HI>Constable.</HI> But so much the worse in him as that he has more trust put in him, is supposed from the advantage of Education and Counsellors to have better Knowledge, and less reason to do it, having already a greater share than the rest of his brethren.</Q> <BIBL>LOCKE on Government.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>—A King governing in a settled Kingdom, leaves to be a King and degenerates into a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> as soon as he leaves off to rule according to his Laws.—All Kings that are not <HI>Tyrants,</HI> or <HI>Perjured,</HI> will be glad to <HI>bound</HI> themselves within the Limits of their Laws. And they that per∣suade them to the contrary, are <HI>Vipers,</HI> Pests both against <HI>them</HI> and the common-wealth.</Q> <BIBL>KING JAMES'S Speech. A.D. 1609.</BIBL></P></NOTE>
and are designed to hold them
<PB N="18" REF="013371_0016_0F90F3ED414D57F0"/>
in subjection as well as the people.—Treason and rebellion therefore may be considered as acts of Violence against the <HI>original compact,</HI> the consti∣tution and laws of society, whether the persons guilty be <HI>rulers</HI> or <HI>subjects.</HI></P>
<P>I AM not insensible this doctrine has been con∣troverted, if it can be said any thing is contro∣verted, when, without reason or argument it is boldly denied, and the contrary supported by fagot and sword.</P>
<P>ABOUT a hundred years ago, when the throne of Great Britain was held by arbitrary Princes, many clergymen, who, we may suppose, set a higher value on preferments than they did on ci∣vil liberty or the rights of conscience, appeared zealous advocates for passive obedience and non-resistance; and were wicked enough to denounce the punishment of eternal damnation against those who ventured to oppose the most tyrannical monarchs.—But that slavish doctrine is now ge∣nerally exploded.—It is so contrary to reason, and the common sense of mankind, that it would
<PB N="19" REF="013371_0017_0F9056911C37C528"/>
be but a mispence of time to expose its ob∣surdity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. EDWARDS'S Discourse of Non-Resistance, and passive obedience.</NOTE></P>
<P>To pretend the precepts of the new testa∣ment require us to yield a quiet and peaceable subjection to the insults of a cruel, ignorant and despotic wretch, who might possibly make his way to the throne, by murder and rebel∣lion, would be to blaspheme the word of God; and I believe no man of understanding would be persuaded to embrace so vile a sentiment e∣ven if the evidence of preternatural events could be adduced in support of it.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">St. Paul foretold that the coming of the man of Sin, or that <HI>lawless one</HI> should be, "after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders."—And the learned BISHOP PA∣TRICK in his commentary on the xiiith of Deuteronomy, supposes the false Prophet, or Dreamer of Dreams, might be permitted to <HI>work a miracle,</HI> in order to seduce the Israelites from their obedience to the true GOD.—But whatever unac∣countable events may take place, it must not be supposed a <HI>true</HI> miracle ever was, or can be wrought to support an absurd doctrine: And we ought rather to suppose there is some deception in those events which <HI>seem</HI> miraculous, than admit them as evidence in support of <HI>nonsense</HI> and wickedness.—</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>THE greatest and wisest nations, and the best of men in all ages, says a fine writer,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">LORD SOMMERS.</NOTE> have reckoned it not only lawful for the peo∣ple, under the most absolute governments to do themselves justice in case of oppression, but have thought the doing of it a duty incumbent on them, and which they owed to themselves and their posterity: And the chief instruments
<PB N="20" REF="013371_0018_0F90ECBFB234D438"/>
of the great revolutions or changes which have happened in the world from slavery to liberty, have always been accounted as <HI>heroes</HI> sent by GOD almighty from time to time, for the redemption of men from misery in this world. They were accordingly honoured and respected whilst they lived, and their memories have been, and will be held in veneration by all posterity.</Q></P>
<P>HISTORY affords us many instances of tyrants and dispotic rulers who have been put to an untimely death, or drove from their seats of government by the people.—But without going abroad, or examining the records of heathen states, the practice of our own nation has been suffici∣ent to teach us, that the wisest of men have judged it lawful, and expedient, to take up arms against their Kings, when they made dan∣gerous encroachments on their rights and li∣berties.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If we look into <HI>Magna Charta</HI> we shall find that KING JOHN made a solemn agreement with his subjects, that if he, or any of his Officers should fail to perform the things stipulated, or should break through any of the articles of peace and security, and neglect or refuse to redress the Grievances of the Subjects after complaint had been proper∣ly made, it should then be lawful for the Barons, together with the community in general, to destrain and distress him, in all the ways possible, by seizing on his lands, castles, possessions, and in any other manner they could, till the Grievance should be redressed according to their pleasure. See <HI>Rapin's History of England</HI></P></NOTE></P>

under them, is far from being new. It is as old as civil government:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I find something so exactly to our purpose in the antient constitution of the Kingdom of ARAGON, that I must beg leave to transcribe it.—<Q>The constitution of their antient government was very remarkable: for when they shook off the <HI>Moorish</HI> yoke they chose <HI>Garcias Xemenes,</HI> descend∣ed from the antient Gothick Kings, to be their Sovereign, on condition that if he or any of his Successors, broke in upon their laws, they should forfeit their Title, and leave the people at liberty to choose another. To keep the King to this agreement, they appointed a Magistrate, intitled <HI>Justitia,</HI> to observe the actions of the King and his Offi∣cers: And this magistrate was answerable to none for his administration but the general meeting of the states. They likewise enacted, that if the King oppressed any of the Subjects, the great men might assemble and seize up∣on his Revenues, till he did Justice to the party offended: And when they enthroned the King he was to kneel down before this Magistrate and to Swear,—That he would inviolably preserve their Laws and Privileges.

<P>It is astonishing that the advocates for passive-obedience and non-resistence, can, with any to∣lerable countenance, profess their loyalty to George the IIId, since they must know, that by opposing the <HI>stuart</HI> family, the British crown was given to the House of <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>
<P>But however strange, it is still possible, that some whose nearest connections were armed and fought against George the IId, can without a blush, charge others with rebellion, who have ventured their fortunes and lives to defend and enlarge his Majesty's dominions,—Who glory in their at∣tachment to the English constitution and the present reigning family, although they cannot <HI>fully</HI> assent to the <HI>omnipotence</HI> of a British Parliament, or ac∣knowledge their right to tax millions of good subjects, whose distance from Old-England will always prevent their being legally represented.</P>
<P>THAT we may and ought, to resist, and even make war against those rulers who leap the bounds prescribed them by the constitution, and attempt to oppress and inslave the subjects, is a principle on which alone the great revolutions which have taken place in <HI>our</HI> nation can be justified.

<Q><P>Soon after the <HI>Americans,</HI> being assisted by some brave European troops, had conquered

Nova-Scotia, Louisburg, all Canada, and the french settlements on the Lakes, together with the western and southern Indians, some among them, whowere unfriendly to the popular go∣vernment established by their fathers, projected a scheme for an American revenue, <HI>intentional∣ly</HI> to aggrandize themselves and their connec∣tions, but <HI>expressly,</HI> for making a more cer∣tain and adequate provision for defreying the charge of the administration of justice and the support of civil Government.</P>
<P>THIS plan was laid before the Parliament of Great-Britain; and although opposed with great spirit, and the clearest reasons by seve∣ral illustrious members of that august assem∣bly,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Specimens of the arguments in opposition to the intention of Parliament to raise a revenue from the Americans may be seen in MR. PITT's Speech on the stamp act, and LORD CAMBDEN's on the declaratory Bill.

Several experiments were made to carry this plan into execution which proved unsuccessful.—That which bid the fairest was a duty on the <HI>East-India</HI> Teas: Large quantities were therefore sent out under the protection of the British Ministry. The fate which this dutied article met with was dif∣ferent in the different colonies to which it was sent: But the opposition was general. At <HI>Bos∣ton,</HI> after every possible endeavour was used to save the property of the East-India com∣pany, by sending the several cargoes of tea back which arrived there, and the people

found themselves unable to do it, unknown persons, many of them supposed to be from the neighbouring country, under the cover of night, boarded the ships which had brought in the Teas, and emptied every Chest into the Sea.</P>
<P>THIS act of violence on the property of the East-India company, was so highly resented by the parliament of Great-Britain, that previous to making any demand on the town or pro∣vince of satisfaction for the Teas which were destroyed, an act was suddenly passed to block up the port of <HI>Boston,</HI> and put an end to their trade; by which many thousands of <HI>innocent</HI> people, were immediately deprived of the means of subsistance, and reduced to the utmost degree of poverty and distress.</P>
<P>THIS extraordinary act of parliament for blocking up the Port of Boston, by which most grievous pains and penalties were inflic∣ted on the inhabitants, before it was possible for them to obtain relief from the crown, e∣ven on supposition of their being ever so hum∣ble and compliant, gave an alarm to the whole continent.—The cause was considered as a com∣mon one.—A <HI>Congress</HI> of the principal inhabi∣tants of all the colonies was held as soon as possible: The result of which was, a quiet and peaceable suspension of trade to and from Great-Britain.—Many affluent merchants laid up their ships, and turned their attention to manufactures; and in a short time the whole continent was well supplied with every neces∣sary

<P>FROM that period we may date the glory of America. The colonies being firmly uni∣ted were free and happy.—They made rapid progress in population, and in the improve∣ment of every useful art: And by their <HI>uni∣on,</HI> their virtue, and industry, rose to their present degree of opulence and strength.</P></Q>
<P>OR is it possible for this generation to afford materials for the historian to write,—<Q>The Ame∣ricans tho' naturally fond of liberty, and tena∣cious of those rights which former Kings had confirmed to their ancestors, at length <HI>Issachar</HI> like, <HI>bowed their shoulder to bear, and became ser∣vants unto tribute.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><P>THEY had indeed made several noble stands against what they considered as infringements of their constitutional rights and privileges; but at length unhappy divisions took place among the Merchants: The lead∣ing men could agree on no plan for the ge∣neral benefit; and those who expected to reap advantage from the establishment of a reve∣nue, found means to create fatal jealousies between the several colonies.—The friends of liberty who remained in those days of gene∣ral corruption and venality, finding themselves unable to stand against the torrent which bore hard against them, were forced to abandon the cause; and an opposition to such revenue laws as the parliament of Great-Britain

<P>FROM this time (which we may <HI>suppose</HI> to be in the 14th year of George the IIId) the Ame∣ricans began to lose their virtue, their love of freedom, and their religion. And being sunk by degrees under burdens, which at last were intolerable, the body of the people became the most ignorant, stupid and abject creatures in the world, fit only for slaves to domineer∣ing masters whose interest it is to hold them in absolute subjection.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author has been informed that some who heard this discourse could have wished the latter part of this imagi∣nary history had been omitted, as they were fearful it might tend to dishearten some good people at this time of trial; but he was induced to place the two pieces in contrast, because he fully thinks that <HI>life and death</HI> in a political sense are <HI>now</HI> set before us; and that the fate of America, for many generations, depends on the virtue of her sons and daughters at the <HI>present</HI> day.</NOTE></P></Q>

<P>MERCENARY troops, who, I may be allowed to say, are not in general possessed of those senti∣ments which ennoble human nature, cannot be trusted in a time of danger, farther than they are influenced by an expectation of plunder, or pay; or a fear of punishment if they are found attempting to desert their colours.—Let them have an assurance of a greater reward, and we may suppose many of them would be willing to change their livery, and engage in the service of a different master.</P>

<P>THE necessity of preparing for unavoidable war, is sufficiently evident.—</P>
<P>BUT we cannot close the subject without la∣menting those moral disorders which are the source of wars and fightings; and expressing our most ardent wishes for universal peace.—And while we are studying the art of war, and endeavouring to prepare for defence against a common enemy, let us show to all who observe us, that we are the loyal subjects of CHRIST; and that in obedience to his precepts, we will never draw our sword in an unrighteous cause, whatever promises of honour, preferment, or riches, may possibly be made us as a reward.</P>
<P>LET us inlist ourselves under the banner of JE∣SUS, and having fought "the good fight of faith, and finished our course," GOD grant we may be admitted into his glorious kingdom, where the laws of righteousness shall never be violated and the children of peace shall never be dis∣turbed.</P>
