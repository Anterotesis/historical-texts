<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Great GOD that formed all Things, and in particular for∣med the Spirit of Man within him, has been pleased to distinguish him from, and exalt him above, all other Creatures in this lower World, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.26, 27.</P>
<P>IN his Nature, Man was here∣in more especially advanced, that he was endued with an Un∣derstanding and Reasonable Soul, and so made capable of acting as a Cause by Counsel, and of governing his Inferiour Powers by Moral Principles and Rules; and
<PB N="2" REF="002152_0003_0FBC77EA6FDB4820"/>
in this way, of aiming at his chief and highest End, which is to Glorify the Great GOD his Creator, and be happy in the Enjoyment of Him for ever.</P>
<P>THUS hath GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught Men <HI>more than the Beasts of the Earth,</HI> and made them <HI>wiser than the Fowls of Heaven,</HI> Job 35.11.</P>
<P>AND as GOD has greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Man in <HI>Making</HI> him such an Excellent Creature; so He has done the like also in the way of his <HI>Dealing with</HI> him, ever since He first gave him his Being.</P>
<P>THUS GOD has done, while He has continually treated Man as a Creature, in respect of his natural Powers, capable of understanding his own Duty, and of aiming at his proper End, of choosing his own way, and weighing the Obligations which he lieth under, to serve the Lord; and of considering the Equity of His Dealings with him, and pursuing those things that are of the greatest Importance and Advantage to him.</P>
<P>ONE Instance of GOD's dealing thus with Men we have in the Words now under Consideration. Towards the beginning of the Chapter, He does by the Prophet Expostulate with His Covenant People of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> on the Account of their many heinous Trans∣gressions; and in particular He upbraids them with the want of Consideration, as the Cause of all their other Miscarriages. Verse 3. <HI>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Ass his Masters crib; but Israel doth not know, my People doth not consider.</HI> He blames them for this, That tho' they were Rational Creatures, yet they did not improve their Reason and Understanding as they ought to do.</P>
<P>FROM the 5th to the 9th Verse, He declareth unto them what heavy Judgments they had exposed them∣selves unto by their Iniquities; and because they were too apt to Plead their own Righteousness, in respect
<PB N="3" REF="002152_0004_0FBC77EB86BC3E40"/>
of the many Outward Religious Services, which they Performed; GOD does from Verse 10. to 15. reject all these Services of theirs as vain and unacceptable to Him, because while they performed them, they con∣tinued still in their wicked and most abominable Prac∣tices. He therefore exhorts them unto Repentance and Reformation, as the sure and only way to escape His Judgments, and come to enjoy His Favour, from Vers. 16. to 19.</P>
<P>AND whereas this People were often too ready to think GOD dealt hardly with them, when their Out∣ward Performances found no acceptance with Him, as in <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.3. <HI>Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest it not,</HI> &amp;c. He offereth in the Wards before us to argue the Case with them, and invites them as Rea∣sonable Creatures, to a Rational Discussion of the Mat∣ter in Controversy betwixt Him and them, that so He might in this way clear up the Equity of His Dealings with them, and make it evident that the Terms of Peace were very reasonable, yea very gracious, which He now propounded to them.</P>
<P>I am not now to consider the matter then in Contro∣versy betwixt GOD and that People; but the Invita∣tion it self, which the Lord was pleased to give them to come to a fair Debate upon the Point, <HI>Come now and let us reason together, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THE meaning of the Words is not, that GOD would Visibly appear to them, and Dispute with them Face to Face, as one Man Disputes with another, (though there seems to be in the Words an Allusion unto such a Dispute) but GOD here speaks unto His People after the manner of Men, and the design of His Words is to signify to them that as He had to do with reasona∣ble Creatures; so His Dealings with them were such as Reason would justifie and discover to be most just and equal, yea and exceeding Merciful also, as they themselves, upon a due Improvement of their Under∣standing might evidently see.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002152_0005_0FBC77ED0A44B538"/>THE DOCTRINE I would observe from the Words is this, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P>DOCTRINE, THAT, <HI>GOD Dealeth with Men as with Reasonable Creatures.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the clearing up of this Truth, I shall endea∣vour, 1. <HI>To shew that GOD doth indeed thus Deal with Men.</HI> 2. <HI>To give some Resons why He does so.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> I SHALL <HI>Shew that GOD does indeed Deal thus with Men.</HI> And this I shall make evident by an <HI>Induction of several Instances,</HI> wherein He Deals thus with them.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P><HI>Instance,</HI> 1. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He taketh Care, and useth Means to instruct them in Sublime and Excellent Mysteries, which only Rational and Intelligent Beings can uderstand.</HI> Very Great and Excellent are the Mysteries which the Blessed GOD is in the way of His Dealing with the Children of Men, taking Care to Instruct them in. 1 Tim 3.16. <HI>Without controversy great is the Mistery of Godliness, God was manifest in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gen∣tiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctrine of the Trinity in the Unity of the Godhead, and of the Decrees of GOD and His Provi∣dence, and the Incarnation of the Son of GOD; and the way of Redemption and Salvation by Him, and the like; are Mysteries very wonderful indeed. They are Mysteries which the <HI>Angels desire to look into,</HI> 1 Pet 2.12 They are fitly called, <HI>The deep things of God,</HI> 1 Cor 2.10</P>
<P>BUT such things as these, GOD is pleased to be ma∣king known unto Men, by His Word written in the Holy Scriptures; and by His Ministers, whom he sends to explain His Oracles unto them. <HI>He hath written
<PB N="5" REF="002152_0006_0FBC77EE84524708"/>
to them the great things of His Law,</HI> Hos. 8.12. And is by His Servants making known to them the Rich and Glorious Mysteries of the Gospel. as <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> Chap. 3. and <HI>Col.</HI> 1.25.27.</NOTE> the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> does in his Epistles declare: And those Mysteries He Revealeth savingly by His Spirit, to as many as He pleaseth as <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> Chap. 2. throughout.</NOTE> the Scriptures also testify.</P>
<P>THAT GOD thus taketh Care and useth Means to Instruct the Children of Men in the Great Truths and Mysteries of the Gospel, does certainly suppose them to have Excellent Understandings in them, capa∣ble of receiving the Instructions of Wisdom which are by Him designed for their Illumination; and GOD herein treateth Men as Creatures that have a Capacity to <HI>Know Wisdom and Instruction,</HI> and <HI>to perceive the Words of Understanding,</HI> Prov. 1.2.</P>
<P><HI>Instance,</HI> 2. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He directeth them to him at a most Excellent End, and by the most proper and suitable means to pursue it.</HI> Thus to Glo∣rify GOD, and to enjoy <HI>Him</HI> for ever, is the Great End which <HI>He</HI> requireth Men to aim at, and in order to their compassing this End, they are commanded to make use of the most suitable Means, and in the Improvement of these, to <HI>Work out their own Salvation,</HI> Phil. 2.12. Unto this End Men are required diligently to attend and improve all the Means of Grace that GOD is plea∣sed to favour them withal. This is what is intended by their <HI>Hearing of Wisdom, watching daily at her Gates, and waiting at the Posts of her Doors,</HI> Prov. 8.34.</P>
<P>NOW thus aiming at a determinate End, and fixing upon, and making use of the most proper and suitable Means for the attainment of it, does certainly suppose Reason and Understanding in those that do or ought to do it; and when GOD puts Men upon thus acting
<PB N="6" REF="002152_0007_0FBC77F00B2F0980"/>
He treats them as Intelligent and Rational Beings, and Honours them as Creatures capable of the highest Views, and the most Excellent Employments and Enjoyments.</P>
<P><HI>Instance,</HI> 3. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He Dealeth with them in the way of a Covenant, which the Unreasonable part of the Creation are utter by uncapable of.</HI> It is certain that GOD has always dealt with Mankind in a Covenant way. When Man was first Created, GOD entred into a Covenant of Works with him, promising Life to him, on Condition of perfect and perpetual Obedience; and threatning him with Death in case of the least Failure, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10, 12. And after Mankind had in <HI>Adam</HI> their Common Head and Representative broken that Covenant, GOD was pleased to propose another Covenant, unto them, <HI>viz.</HI> The New-Covenant or Covenant of Grace, according unto which they might be delivered from the Curse and Death due to them on the Account of their Violation of the Covenant, first made with them, and might also obtain Eternal Happiness through a Glorious Redeemer provided for them.</P>
<P>THIS Covenant was, tho' in obscure. Terms, pro∣posed for the Relief of Sinful Man, soon after his Fall into Sin, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. but has been more fully opened and explained, unto Sinners since in the Scriptures, especially in those of the New-Testament, as in <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.8. to 10. and elsewhere.</P>
<P>IN these Covenants are expressed the Duties which Men owe unto GOD, according to the Tenure of them, and the Sins also which are contrary unto these Du∣ties. Here also are set down the Rewards and Punish∣ments, which Men are to expect according as they do or do not keep Covenant with the Lord their GOD, as in <HI>Deut.</HI> Chap. 28.</P>
<P>UNDER one or other of these Covenants all Man∣kind are. Those who have not laid hold of the Cove∣nant
<PB N="7" REF="002152_0008_0FBC77F429014C98"/>
of Grace, or Accepted the Terms of it, are still under the Covenant of Works, and must stand or fall according as they do, or do not fulfill the Conditions of it; which since the fall it is impossible any Man in his own Person should do. Therefore such as are under the Law of Works are under the Curse, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10, 12. Those who lay hold of the Covenant of Grace, are by GOD dealt withal according to the Tenure of that Covenant, <HI>Rome</HI> 6.14. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.7, — 9.</P>
<P>THUS GOD treateth Men in the way of a Cove∣nant, and every Man must receive a Reward accor∣ding to the Tenure of that Covenant, wherein he standeth related unto GOD; and while GOD does thus deal with Men in a Covenant way, He Dealeth with them as with Rational Beings; He treateth them as such as are capable of Understanding the Nature of a Covenant, the Conditions of that in which them∣selves are; and so the Terms wherein they stand with GOD, who has been pleased to enter into Covenant with them, as also of weighing on the one hand the Advantages they may have by complying with what is in the Covenant required of them; and on the o∣ther, of Counting the cost of their neglecting, or refu∣sing so to do.</P>
<P><HI>Instance,</HI> 4. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He putteth them upon making their own free and del<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>te Choice, and that in Cases wherein their Choosing well, is of very great Importance.</HI> There are innumerable Cases e∣very Day occurring, wherein Men are called to choose either what is best to be done, or most desirable to be enjoyed, or most carefully to be avoided, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Indeed all those Actions wherein Men are obliged to distinguish themselves from Bruits, ought to be ordered and governed, by a Free and Wise Choice of their se∣veral Objects, Means, manner of Performance, and Circumstances of Time and Place, with whatsoever
<PB REF="002152_0009_0FBC77F569FBDD20"/>
else is necessary to render them every way good and profitable.</P>
<P>BUT there is especially one Case wherein GOD puts Men unto their own free Choice, wherein their choosing well, is of the last Importance to them; and GOD in putting Men to their Choice in such a case as this, does evidently treat them as such, as have good Understandings in them, capable of making such a Choice as they ought to do. In such a weighty Case <HI>Israel,</HI> were in the most solemn manner, put upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Deut. 10.19. <HI>I call Heaven and Earth to Record this Day against you▪ that I have set before you Life and Death, Blessing and Cursing; therefore choose Life, that thou and thy Seed may Live.</HI> So in, Josh. 24.15. <HI>If it seem evil to you to serve the Lord, Choose you this Day whom you will serve,</HI> &amp;c. GOD does not here leave Men unto their Liberty, whether they will serve him, or other Gods; but does require them to make use of their Reason and Understanding in making such a Choice of the Object of their Worship, as may be for their own best Good. GOD accordingly commends such as choose well for themselves. Luke 10.42. <HI>Many hath Chosen that good part, that shall not be taken away from her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Instance,</HI> 5. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that upon all Occasions He useth Arguments with them, proper unto Rational Beings, to press and excite them unto their Duty, and to diswade them from doing those things that are evil in His Sight.</HI> When GOD calleth upon Men to fear and serve Him, He still urgeth them to their Du∣ty herein with such Arguments as none but Intelligent and Rational Beings can understand, and be influenced by. GOD never requireth any Service of Men with∣out giving them good Reason for it.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES indeed GOD presseth Men to Obe∣dience from the Consideration of His own Sovereign Authority and Dominion over them, as in Lev. 19.30.
<PB N="9" REF="002152_0010_0FBC77F6D770BF68"/>
<HI>Observe all my Statutes and all my Judgments, and do them. I am the Lord</HI>; but what can be a more strong and forceable Reason for Obedience than this is? Nay un∣less this Influence Men in what they do, there is really nothing of Obedience therein.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the Reason with which Obedience is pressed is taken from the Excellency of the Things re∣quired as in Micah 6 8. <HI>He hath shewed thee O Man what is good, and what not the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> require of thee, but to do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God</HI>?</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the Good that GOD has done to and for Men is urged as a Reason to excite their Obedi∣ence unto Him as in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sam 12.24. <HI>Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart, for consider how great thines He hath done for you.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN Sometimes Men are pressed unto Obedi∣ence from the Consideration of the Great Advantages they may receive thereby This Argument <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> used in our Context Isa 1 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the Land,</HI> and Psal 37.3 <HI>Trust in the Lord and do good, so shalt thou aw<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in the Land and verily thou shalt be fed.</HI></P>
<P>THUS also when GOD would disswade Men from doing those things which are evil in his Sight; He always gives them good Argument for what He sayes to them</P>
<P>SOMETIMES He urgeth them with the Conside∣rations of the Intrinsick evil of those Sins he would re∣strain them from, So in Lev 18 18. <HI>It is an Abomination,</HI> and Jer. 44.4 <HI>O do not this Abominable thing that I hate.</HI></P>
<P>SOMETIMES Men are informed that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doing such things they will greatly provoke a Holy and Jea∣lous GOD, and Incense His Displeasure against them; and that thus to do is the greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1 Cor. 11 22. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> provoke the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Jealousy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> than He?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002152_0011_0FBC77F88E814990"/>SOMETIMES Again, GOD lets Men know how unworthy and disingenious they will shew themselves to be, if by their Iniquities they Reward Him Evil for His Goodness. Deut. 32.6. <HI>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish and unwise? Is He not thy Father that bought thee? Hath He not made thee and formed thee</HI>? When GOD thus Argueth with Men He certainly Dealeth with them as with Reasonable Creatures.</P>
<P><HI>Instance,</HI> 6. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that as occasion does require, He useth Means to Convince them of the unreasonableness of their Actions and Carriages towards Him.</HI> As GOD would in a Rational way restrain Men from Sin; so when they have Sinned, He useth Rati∣onal Methods to convince them of their Folly and Madness in Departing from Him, and to bring them unto a due sense of the unreasonableness of their De∣portment and Behaviour before Him.</P>
<P>TO this end GOD shews such as have departed from Him, and by their Sins provoked Him, That they have no good Plea or Excuse to make for their so do∣ing. So in Judg. 2.2. <HI>Ye have not obeyed my Voice: Why have ye done this</HI>? Hear how GOD argueth with Israel to this purpose, Jer. 2 5, 6 <HI>What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me that they are gone far from me, and have walked after Vanity and are become vain? Neither said they where is the Lord that brought us up out of Aegypt,</HI> &amp;c. Also Micah 6.2, 3. <HI>The Lord hath a Controversy with His People, and will plead with Israel, O my People, What have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against Me.</HI> Thus GOD convinceth His People that they have nothing to alledge against Him as a Reason of their forsaking of Him.</P>
<P>TO the same End GOD frequently sheweth Men now unreasonable their Carriages are in respect of the Ingratitude of which they are guilty in them; so in Isa. 1.2, <HI>I have nourished and brought up Children, and they
<PB N="11" REF="002152_0012_0FBC77F9B61F1A40"/>
have rebelled against me.</HI> Also Isa. 63.9.10. <HI>In all their affliction he was afflicted; and the Angel of his Presence saved them, in his love and in his pity be redeemed them, and he have them, and carryed them all the Dayes of old. But they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 32.9, — 19, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6 24.</NOTE> This Argument is much insisted on in Scripture, GOD would have Men see that such a deportment before Him, is very unrea∣sonable.</P>
<P>WITH the same design GOD sometimes shews Men how absurd and ridiculous their Practices are, that so He may make them ashamed of their Abominations. Thus GOD by a Prophet said to <HI>Amaziah,</HI> 2 Chron. 25.15. <HI>Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thy hand</HI>? In this way GOD would have made <HI>Israel</HI> ashamed of their Idolatry, <HI>Isa.</HI> 44. from ver. 9. to 18. where ha∣ving at large exposed the absurdity of their first ma∣king gods and then falling down and worshipping the same; He in Verse 19. speaketh thus to, and of them. <HI>None considereth in his heart, neither is their knowledge, nor understanding to say, I have burnt part of it in the Fire; yea also I have baked bread upon the Coals thereof: I have roasted Flesh and eaten it; and shall I make the residue thereof an Abomination? shall I fall down to the Stock of a Tree?</HI></P>
<P>WHEN GOD thus sheweth Men how unreasonably they act in Sinning against Him, He Dealeth with them as with Reasonable Creatures.</P>
<P><HI>Instance,</HI> 7. GOD thus Dealeth with Men, <HI>In that as need calls for it, He clears up to then the equity of His Dealings with them.</HI> Men are very apt to find fault with GOD; and to quarrel at His Dispensations; they are often ready to think that GOD Dealeth hardly with them: but He is ever ready to give pro∣per and suitable Answers to what they have to Object
<PB N="12" REF="002152_0013_0FBC77FBF7E58648"/>
against Him, and to make it evident that He no way wrongs them. Thus in our Text, GOD calls His People to Reason with Him▪ that so He might make them see the Equity, yea the Kindness of His way of Dealing with them.</P>
<P>GOD indeed sometimes Answers Men's proud and unreasonable cavils against Him, by asserting His own absolute Soveraignity over them, and so His Right to do with them, what seemeth good in His sight. But even then, when GOD pleadeth His own absolute Dominion over Men, He still dealeth with them as with Rational and Intelligent Beings, in that He sheweth them that it is highly Reasonable, that He should exercise such a Dominion over every thing that He has made. To this purpose GOD argueth with Men, in <HI>Rom. Chap.</HI> 9. <HI>Ver.</HI> 19. Men are brought in thus Disputing against GOD, <HI>Why doth he yet find fault, for who hath resisted his will?</HI> Unto which cavil GOD by the Apostle thus answereth, Verse 20, 21. <HI>Nay but O Man, who art thou that replyest against God? Shall the thing formed say unto him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the same lump to make one Vessel unto honour, and another to dishonour</HI>?</P>
<P>SOMETIMES GOD is pleased to answer Mens Objections against Him, without thus insisting upon His own absolute Soveraignty. Thus in <HI>Ezek.</HI> Chap. 18. GOD answereth the Objection made by the Peo∣ple against Him, <HI>That the Fathers had eaten sowre Grapes, and the Childrens teeth were set on edge</HI>; by which was meant that the Children were punished for the Sins of the Parents, and from this the People inferred, <HI>That the way of the Lord was not equal.</HI></P>
<P>IN Answer unto this Objection, GOD shewed the People their great mistake, in alleging that Children were punished for their Parents Sins. He shewed them at large, that the Soul that Sinneth shall die; and that
<PB N="13" REF="002152_0014_0FBC77FE8144B8E8"/>
the Son shall not bear the Iniquity of the Father; nei∣ther the Father bear the Iniquity of the Son, but that every one shall be Rewarded according to his own Works; and then He proceeded thus to Expostulate with them. Ver. 29. <HI>Yet ye say the way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now O house of Israel, Are not my ways equal? Are not your ways unequal</HI>?</P>
<P>THUS also GOD cleareth up the Equity of His Dealings with His People with respect to the Means He afforded them for their good. GOD considereth Men as Reasonable Creatures, and therefore affordeth them sufficient Means for the Ends He obligeth them to pursue and prosecute. He puteth a Price into their hands to be improved for their Advantage, <HI>Prov.</HI> 17 16. He distributeth Talents unto one and another, accor∣ding to their respective Abilities, and requireth them to trade with them <HI>Mith.</HI> 25.14, 15, 16. And if it be needful, He convinceth them, that nothing hath been wanting on His part, that could Reasonably be ex∣pected of Him, in Order to the promoting of their Hap∣piness.</P>
<P>THUS GOD Convinced the <HI>Jews</HI> of the Sufficien∣cy of the Means and Cultivations He afforded to them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.1, — 5. Where speaking of them under the Similitude of a Vineyard. He (1.) declareth that He had <HI>Planted this Vineyard of his, in a very fruitful Hill, and had fenced it, and gathered out the Stones thereof, and plan∣ted it with the choisest Vine,</HI> &amp;c. thereby signifying what Means He had used, and what Cost and Pains He had been at, for the good of His People. (2) He shews them the Expectation He thereupon had that His Vine∣yard would have brought forth good Fruit, <HI>He looked that it would have brought forth Grapes</HI> (3.) He decla∣reth the disappointment He had with respect hereto, <HI>It brought forth Wild Grapes</HI>; bad Fruit, instead of good. (4.) He hereupon thus Reasoneth with His People, this Vineyard of His. <HI>And now O Inhabitants of Jerusalem,

and Men of Judah, judge I pray you betwixt me, and my Vineyard; What could have been done more to my Vineyard than I have done in it? Wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth Grapes, brought it forth Wild Grapes</HI>?</P>
<P>SURELY, this is to deal with Men as with Reaso∣nable Creatures; GOD does here Appeal unto His People's own Reason and Conscience, whether He had not dealt very well by them, in affording a sufficiency of Means to them; so that their unfruitfulness did evidently appear to be from their own unreasonable and culpable neglect; and was not in any wise to be Charged upon Him. He let them know that He dealt not by them as those <HI>unreasonable Men</HI> their <HI>Aegyptian Task masters</HI> had formerly done, in requiring Brick of them in full Tale; but not affording them Straw, <HI>Exod.</HI> Chap. 5.</P>
<P><HI>Instance,</HI> 8. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He cleareth up to them, the fairness of the Process at the Great Assize or Day of Judgment; and the Justice of the Sen∣tence, that shall then be passed upon both Good and Bad.</HI> As Men are fully assured that there will be a Great and General Day of Judgment, in which all Rational and Intelligent Creatures, must give an Account of themselves and of their Actions unto GOD, (as it is Reason they should do,) <HI>Acts</HI> 17.31. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.12. So GOD also assures them that the Proceedings of that Day shall be most Just and Reasonable. He does as∣sure Men that things shall not in that Day be managed in a way merely Arbitary, without respect to Reason and Justice; but that all Causes and Pleas shall be then duly heard &amp; considered, &amp; that Right Judgment accor∣ding to Law and Evidence, shall then proceed.</P>
<P><HI>THE Books therefore are then to be Opened, and the dead,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> those that were so) <HI>are to be judged accor∣ding to the things written therein, according to their Works,</HI> Rev. 20.12. Therefore, <HI>Every Work must be</HI> then
<PB N="15" REF="002152_0016_0FBC78021491AFA0"/>
<HI>brought into Judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil,</HI> Eccl. 12.14. There will be no partiality then used, but Sentence will be given without respect of Persons, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.6. — 11. Then as many as have Sinned without the written Law of GOD, shall be Punished without it; and as many as have Sinned under the Law, shall be judged by it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.12. — 16 Every one shall then be convinced, that the judgment of GOD is according to Truth, against those that do such things as Men shall be punished for The End of the last Judgment as it respects the wicked, is not only that they may be punished but also that they may be convinced of their wickedness, and of the Justice of GOD, in the Sen∣tence passed on them. <HI>For behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all the hard speeches, which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him,</HI> Jude, ver. 14.15. Not only the Consciences; but even the Mouths of wicked Men shall then bear witness against themselves. Luk. 19.22, 23. <HI>Out of thine own Mouth will I Judge thee, thou wicked Servant,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>HOW fair the Process of the Great and last Day of Judgment will be, and how just the Sentence, both with respect to the Righteous, and the wicked; Jesus Christ the Great Judge, does Himself assure us, <HI>Math.</HI> 25.31, — 46 where the reason of the Sentence, with respect unto both, is distinctly cleared up, that every one may see the Justice and Equity of it. GOD in dealing thus with Men, and in leting them know before-hand that they shall be thus treated, dealeth with them as with Reasonable Creatures.</P>
<P>AND to add but one thing more,</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002152_0017_0FBC78037A1C4820"/><HI>Instance,</HI> 9. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that he often puteth them upon a deep and serious Consideration of those things wherein, or wherewith, as Rational and Intelli∣gent Beings, they are concerned.</HI> As GOD has made Man a Creature capable of thinking, so He treateth him as such a Creature, in putting him upon such a use and improvement of his Reason and Understanding, as does become one that is endued with such noble and excellent Powers as Man is; and GOD is displeased at it, if Man shew himself bruitishly inconsiderate, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.3.</P>
<P>HOW often do we find GOD in Scripture, putting Men upon the Study and Consideration of those things wherein His Glory is concerned, and which the Con∣sideration of, may be of Advantage to themselves. Thus GOD requireth that Men <HI>Know and consider in their hearts, that the Lord he is God in Heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and that there is none else,</HI> Deut. 4.39. And that they <HI>Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God,</HI> Job 37.14. That they <HI>Consider what great things God hath done for them,</HI> 1 Sam 12.24. And that they also Consider what He in His Word says to them, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.7. They ought also to <HI>Study how to shew them∣selves approved unto God,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.15. And should <HI>Con∣sider their ways,</HI> and GOD's Dispensations towards them. <HI>Hag.</HI> 1.5, — 7. GOD does moreover re∣quire that Men <HI>Examine</HI> and Consider, <HI>Whether they be in the Faith</HI> or not, 2. Cor. 13.5. And that every Man should by serious Consideration, <HI>Prove his own Work,</HI> Gal. 6.4.</P>
<P>THESE and many other things of the like Impor∣tance, GOD is in His Word, putting Men upon the Consideration of, and it is certain that He herein treateth them as Rational and Intelligent Beings capa∣ble of proper Meditations and Reflections upon the va∣rious Objects proposed to their Contemplation; which that they really are, has been supposed in all that has
<PB N="17" REF="002152_0018_0FBC7804F671F148"/>
been said to prove that GOD dealeth with them as with Reasonable Creatures; and that He does so, has been now made sufficiently evident. I shall therefore proceed,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>II. <HI>TO give some Reasons Why He does so.</HI> And they are such as here follow, <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Reason,</HI> 1. GOD dealeth with Men as with Rea∣sonable Creatures; <HI>Because such they are, and it is very suitable that they should by GOD be dealt withal in such a Way as is agreeable to the Natures by Himself given unto them.</HI> As there is an excellent Harmony among the Divine Attributes; so there is a very remarkable agree∣ment among the Divine Operations: This appears in GODs delighting to work in, with, and by Se∣cond Causes, in a way agreeable to the Natural Qua∣lities and Dispositions, which He Himself has put into them In this He shews His Wisdom, and puts an Honour upon the works of His own Hands: He here∣by shews that it is not in vain that He has put such Principles and Qualities into them, seeing He maketh use of them, and worketh with and by them in the Government of the World. As therefore Inanimate and Irrational Creatures are governed in a way suitable to the Natures given unto them; so also Rationable and Intelligent Beings, as Angels and Men, are ruled and ordered in such a way, as is agreeable unto the excellent Natures with which they are indued. Man therefore being a Reasonable Creature, GOD con∣stantly deals with him as such an One, treating him in a way agreeable to his Nature, and influencing of him by such Means as none but Intelligent Beings can be moved by.</P>
<P><HI>Reason,</HI> 2. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>Because the Nature of the Government which He has set up over them
<PB N="18" REF="002152_0019_0FBC7808A0DD5C50"/>
does Necessarily call for it.</HI> As GOD made Men capa∣ble of being governed by Laws with Sanctions, which Irrational Creatures are not; so He has determined to govern them by such Laws, <HI>viz.</HI> Precepts and Pro∣hibitions, with Promises and Threatnings: But now the Nature of this kind of Government does require that Men be dealt withal as Intelligent and Rational Beings, capable of acting as Free-Agents; and of being influenced by Moral considerations; and if they were moved in any other way, as by meer Physical Influ∣ence, this would not agree unto the Nature of a mo∣ral subjection unto GOD, which consists in a Spon∣taneous, or Voluntary Obedience and Submission unto His Will: Therefore if Men should in these things be dealt withal in any other way than as Reasonable Creatures, they could be no more said to obey GOD in their Motions, than Irrational Animals, and Crea∣tures without Life, may be said to do; which would be very far from that Reasonable Service which GOD requireth of Men, and will only accept at their Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Reason,</HI> 3. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>Because this way sutes well with His Design of displaying His own Glory, and being admired on the account of it.</HI> Tho' GOD might have been Perfectly and Eternally happy in the Enjoyment of Himself, tho' no Creature had ever been made; yet it hath pleased Him to create the World to be a kind of Mirror wherein His own Glory may be seen and admired; and to make a Number of Crea∣tures capable of viewing His Perfections shining forth therein, and of giving Him Glory on the account of them.</P>
<P>UNTO this Number Mankind belong, and as they are capable of glorifying <HI>GOD</HI> in an active way, so this is the Sum of what <HI>He</HI> requires of them: And that He may effectually oblige them to perform their duty herein, He treats them as Reasonable and Intelli∣gent
<PB N="19" REF="002152_0020_0FBC7809CFE0D5A8"/>
Beings, capable of Understanding their Duty and doing it, and of seeing the Obligations they lye un∣der, willingly to engage in the Great Work incumbent on them. He requireth them to behold &amp; admire His Glory, which appeareth in His admirable works of Creation, Providence, and Redemption; and then to shew forth His Praise unto Others, by <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 96.3. <HI>&amp;</HI> 105.2.</NOTE> Talking of the Marvellous things that He hath done. And when they are defective herein He lays great blame to them on the account thereof. He lets them know <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 96.7, 8. <HI>Rev.</HI> 15.4.</NOTE> that Glory is due to Him, and how reasonable a thing it is that they should render it to His Name.</P>
<P>AND GOD does not only thus call and require Men to give Glory to Him but gives rational Answers to all such Objections as they are ready to make a∣gainst it. He takes up all the stumbling Blocks out of the way, that nothing may hinder them from per∣forming their duty herein; and if there be any thing that seemeth to reflect Dishonour upon Him, He plainly and fairly removeth it, as in <HI>James</HI> 1.13, 14.</P>
<P>NOW in all this, Men are treated as Reasonable Creatures, and that they should be so, tends so much to GODs Glory, and sutes so well with His Design of exalting His own Name, that this may be looked upon as one Reason of His dealing thus with them.</P>
<P><HI>Reason,</HI> 4. <HI>THERE is much to be ascribed unto the Soveraign good Will and Pleasure of the blessed GOD, with respect to His thus dealing with Men.</HI> Whatsoever Rea∣sons may be assigned for His dealing thus with them; yet it is certain that as the case now stands, GOD's doing thus is very much to be ascribed to His Conde∣scending Grace.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002152_0021_0FBC780AF8C1D4B8"/>MAN-kind have by their Apostasy from GOD forfeited all the Advantages which in their Estate of Integrity they had some right unto; so that in point of Justice, Men do not now deserve to be by GOD treated as they are; but on the contrary, that GOD should deal with them in a way of Wrath and Dis∣pleasure only: There therefore now appeareth in the way of GOD's treating the Children of Men, much of His Condescending Goodness; and here-unto must His dealing with them in such a Manner as now He does, be very much ascribed.</P>
<P>THAT now GOD perswades Men, Reasons the Case with them, answereth their sinful Cavils, and vain and foolish Objections, with so much Patience, and Long-suffering, as He still does; must needs be attributed to His Great Mercy and Kindness. It is certain, this is that which moves Him to treat such as have exceedingly provoked Him, as He does these unto whom He speaks in our Text, when He calls them to come and reason with Him, about those things wherein their Eternal Welfare is concerned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>USE,</HI> I. DOES GOD deal with Men is with Reasonable Creatures, <HI>Then have Men no just Cause to complain of His Dealings with them; but great Reason to acknowledge them to be very Wise, Just, and Merciful.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IF GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>He certainly dealeth Wisely with them,</HI> in that He treateth them in a way agreeable to the Natures He hath given to them. GOD perfectly knoweth what kind of Crea∣tures Men are; and hath set up such a sort of Govern∣ment over them, as is suitable to the Nature of such Creatures as they be; and He manageth His Govern∣ment of them in such a way and manner as is agree∣able to the <HI>Laws</HI> by which He Rules them, as well
<PB N="21" REF="002152_0022_0FBC780C9875BFD0"/>
as unto their <HI>Natures.</HI> He makes known His Laws to them, shews them the Equity and Goodness of them, the Advantages they may have by keeping them, and the Miseries they will expose themselves unto by breaking them; and when at any time they transgress against Him, He sheweth them how Reasonable a thing it is that they Repent of their Miscarriages, and Re∣form their Lives and Conversations; and that their future and Eternal Well being does depend upon their so doing. He useth Means for their Instruction and Illumination, shews them how Justice may be satis∣fyed for their Offences; and how they may be re∣conciled unto GOD, against whom they have offended. He proposeth Arguments for the over-coming, and gaining of cheir Wills; and makes Representations to them, that are suitable to work on their Affections. Thus <HI>He draws them with the Cords of a Man,</HI> Hos. 11.4. And He herein doubtless dealeth very wisely with them, because in a way suitable to their Nature, and the Great design He is managing with them.</P>
<P>THUS also GOD dealth wisely with them, in suting His Providences unto the Circumstances they are under. GOD wisely considereth the Condition that Men are in. He duly weigheth their Estate and Circumstances, and so what may be necessary for them, and what hurtful to them; and then orders out Com∣fort, and Afflictions, and proportioneth them, as in His Wisdom He seeth necessary, <HI>Isai.</HI> 27.8.</P>
<P>MEN have, on these accounts, great Reason to acknowledge that GOD dealeth very wisely with them. If they speak truly, they must confess, <HI>He hath abounded towards them in all Wisdom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. IF GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>He also dealeth very Justly with them.</HI> His dealings with them are such that nothing can be rationally and fairly objected against them.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002152_0023_0FBC780E044379F8"/>GOD can, in point of Reason and Equity, Justify all His Actions towards the Children of Men; so that if He should enter into a calm debate with them about the Justice and Equity of His Dispensation, allowing them <HI>to talk with Him of His Judgments,</HI> and should not suffer <HI>His Terrors to make them afraid</HI>; He could so fully answer all Objections that they could possibly make with respect to the Justice of His deal∣ings with them; that if it were not their own fault, they might clearly see the Reasonableness of them. <HI>He will not,</HI> He does not, <HI>lay upon Man more than is Right, that he should enter into Judgment with GOD</HI>: Or have just Reason to complain of His dealings with Him, <HI>Job</HI> 34.23.</P>
<P>MEN are very apt to complain of GOD, as if He dealt very hardly by them, or as if <HI>His Ways were un∣equal</HI>; But GOD can, and does afford them matter of Rational Conviction that they have no good reason for such Complaints. Thus stood the case betwixt GOD and His People, <HI>Ezek Chap.</HI> 18. But He said that to them which either did, or should have fully satisfyed them, that His dealings with them were very reaso∣nable. Whatever some Men may think of GOD, yet He is, and in the Issue, will appear to be, <HI>Righteous in all His ways, and Holy in all His works,</HI> Psal. 145.17. GOD will shortly so fully clear up the Justice of His dealings with His Creatures, that they shall see and acknowledge the Equity of them all, and be obliged to Glorify Him on that account. It will appear that neither Men nor Angels have had any good reason to complain of Him.</P>
<P>AND I shall here observe, That tho' Soveraignty be an Attribute of GOD, who <HI>does,</HI> and may do <HI>ac∣cording to His Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth; and none can stay His Hand, or say unto Him, What doest thou?</HI> Dan. 4.35. Yet is GOD's Justice and Soveraignty are distinguishable one from
<PB N="23" REF="002152_0024_0FBC780FADDCA578"/>
the other, so it is not to be supposed that GOD ever <HI>so</HI> exerciseth His Soveraign Power as to act any ways contrary to Justice or Equity. We must remember that the object of Divine Soveraignty, is What with respect to GODs other Glorious Attributes, may be either fitly done, or not done; and it is with respect to such things as these that GOD doth in Scripture Justifie His Actions on the Account of His Soveraign Power and Lordship: As therefore GOD by His So∣veraign Power, neither does nor can act any thing Contrary to His Infinite Wisdom, and Unalterable Truth; so neither can nor will He by the same Power and Authority do any thing contrary to His most perfect Justice: And thus there appeareth a most exact Harmony among the Divine Attributes; and herein I conceive the Holiness of GOD eminently to consist.</P>
<P>AND hence, as it is a true Proposition, That what∣soever GOD does is very just and equal; so it is no less true, that there are some things that are in their own Nature unjust, and therefore such as GOD nei∣ther can nor will do. This Truth is supposed in all those <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek.</HI> Chap. 18. <HI>Neh.</HI> 9.33. <HI>Job</HI> 34.10, 11, 12.</NOTE> Places of Scripture, wherein the Justice and Equity of GOD's Dealings with His Creatures is vin∣dicated, and His Care to deal Righteously by them is asserted. But here poor simple Men must be very cau∣tious, and not be over confident with respect to par∣ticular things, either that they may be justly done, or not, least they Sin in charging GOD foolishly. To be sure it is a good Rule, that whatever GOD does, is very Just and Righteous, whether Men see the Equity of it, yea or no.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>He dealeth very mercifully and kindly by them.</HI> In this not only His Justice,
<PB N="24" REF="002152_0025_0FBC7810F55CE380"/>
but even his Mercy and Kindness towards Men ap∣peareth. In the Condition that Mankind now are, GOD in treating of them as He does, while He is dealing with them as with Reasonable Creatures, does shew abundance of undeserved Favour and Kindness unto them. How kindly does GOD treat Men, when He speaks to them as in our Text, and the Words immediately following, <HI>Come now, and let us reason to∣gether, saith the Lord: Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wooll.</HI> Thus GOD <HI>draws Men with the bands of Love,</HI> Hos. 11.4. <HI>Allures them, and speaks Comfortably unto them,</HI> Chap. 2. ver. 14. He swears to them, that <HI>He taketh no pleasure in their Death, but on the contrary that they should turn from their own evil ways and live,</HI> Ezek. 33.11.</P>
<P>THUS kindly doth GOD deal with Men. To be sure if they duely consider how He treats them, they must acknowledge He dealeth very well by them.</P>
<P><HI>USE,</HI> II. DOES GOD deal with Men as with Reasonable Creatures, <HI>Then surely Men ought to deal thus with one another.</HI> If GOD, who is Infinitely Supe∣riour unto the greatest Men in the World, does yet not disdain thus to treat them, How much more may they expect to be thus treated by those who are <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> 27.16.</NOTE> of one Blood with them, and so by Nature equal to them.</P>
<P>MAN-kind was not made to be Goverened by meer force and violence and driven <HI>to</HI> and <HI>fro,</HI> as those In∣feriour Creatures were that were put in Subjection to them. GOD Himself does not so Exercise His Au∣thority over them; He considers and deals by them as MEN, and would have them know themselves so to be, and expect to be dealt with accordingly, and would
<PB N="25" REF="002152_0026_0FBC781499831CD8"/>
have others also observe it, in order to their treating of them in such a manner as is suitable to so noble a Species of Being as they are.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this we find that tho' <HI>Israel</HI> be Metaphorically spoken of as a Flock of Sheep under Shepherds, unto whose care they were committed, <HI>Ezek.</HI> Chap. 34. Yet they were in the close of that Chapter, by GOD put in mind of what they really were, Vers. 31. <HI>And ye my Flock, the Flock of my Pasture, are Men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God.</HI> If GOD's Flock be <HI>Men,</HI> their Shepherds ought to carry it to∣wards them accordingly, by treating them as Reaso∣nable Creatures <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3</NOTE> <HI>Not lording of it over them</HI>; but shew∣ing them their Duty, and by whose Authority they are called to it, and what Obligations they are under to perform it. These should therefore be Men able to render a Reason, and by solid Arguments, to prove what they say, and to <HI>Convince gain-sayers</HI>; for if Men's Reason and Consciences be not convinced, all the Cur∣ses denounced from <HI>Mount-Ehal,</HI> will avail very little to oblige them to their Duty, nor will External force and compulsion, if used, make any good Impressions on them. Ministers therefore who treat with Men in GOD's Name should, like <HI>Paul,</HI> Reason about the Things of which they Discourse, He <HI>Reasoned of Righ∣teousness, Temperance, and Judgment to come,</HI> and <HI>Faelia trembled,</HI> Acts 24.25. And this seems to have been <HI>Paul</HI>'s ordinary way, Acts 17.2. <HI>And Paul as his man∣ner was, went in unto them, &amp; three Sabbath Days Reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.</HI> This course also <HI>Samuel</HI> took with <HI>Israel,</HI> 1 Sam. 12.6, 7. He <HI>said unto them, — Stand still, that I may Reason with you before the Lord.</HI> —</P>
<P><HI>USE,</HI> III. DOES GOD deal with Men as with Reasonable Creatures, <HI>Then surely Men should take heed
<PB N="26" REF="002152_0027_0FBC78157A2EB6E0"/>
of every thing, which tendeth to render them uncapable of be∣ing thus treated, with Advantage or Success.</HI> As GOD made us Rational Creatures; so He condescends to Reason and Argue with us, about things that are of the greatest importance and concernment to us; He is willing that Reason should decide every case wherein He has to do with us: And if there be any matters of Controversy betwixt Him and us, He invites us to argue with Him upon them, and gives us leave to <HI>bring forth our strong Reasons,</HI> if we have any such, <HI>Isa.</HI> 41.21.</P>
<P>AND are Men thus called to argue the Case with GOD, to hear Reason from Him, and to give good and wise Answers unto Him; surely they had need be well prepared for this, that in the things wherein they have to do with so wise and holy a Being as He is, they may behave themselves as becomes Rational and Intelligent Beings, and not dishonour themselves by a carriage unworthy of the Character which they bear, and of the Honour that GOD is pleased to put upon them, in treating of them as He does; and they had need take special heed of every thing that tends to unfit them for behaving themselves well, when they are called to Reason with Him.</P>
<P>AND I shall here mention <HI>Three Things</HI> which Peo∣ple had need on this account, take great heed of, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GROSS Ignorance.</HI> This exceedingly unfits Per∣sons for being treated as Reasonable Creatures with Advantage. I speak here of such Ignorance as is op∣posed unto Knowledge, that may be acquired by an Industrious use of means. Tho' Persons have never so good natural Parts, yet if they are grosly Igno∣rant, how exceedingly does this unfit them both for understanding Reason themselves, and speaking Reason
<PB N="27" REF="002152_0028_0FBC7816F4E78C70"/>
unto others. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Wadsworth</HI>'s Preface to his Exposition on the Assemblies Catechism, <HI>p.</HI> 4.</NOTE> Thus there are many who for want of common Learning, can hardly understand the Language in which People ordinarily speak; and to be sure are far from understanding much of the Language where∣in GOD in the Scriptures speaks to them. Such Words as Justification, Adoption and Regeneration are hard Words to them; and they have little benefit by the plainest Sermons, because they cannot understand them.</P>
<P>NOW how miserably qualified are such is these, to be treated in a Rational way, about things that have any difficulty in them Persons should take care that they may be more capable of understanding what GOD says to them, and the force of the Arguments He useth with them; and Heads of Families should take care that their Children and Servants, may not want those Instructions that are necessary unto this end.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>STRONG Prejudices.</HI> These do also exceedingly un∣fit Men for being treated in a Rational way, to any good Purpose, either by GOD or Men. When GOD dealeth with Men as with Reasonable Creatures, He doubtless would have them use their Reason very free∣ly, and put forth the Powers of their Souls unto the utmost, in weighing and examining the things pro∣posed to them, to be considered by them, and GOD says nothing to Men, but what will bear the strictest Examination and Trial.</P>
<P>BUT now if Men suffer their Judgments to be fore∣stalled, and their Minds prepossessed with Prejudices, against the things that GOD would perswade them unto, they do hereby render themselves exceeding un∣fit for such a Treaty as GOD is seeking to manage with them; and when it is thus, the plainest and
<PB N="28" REF="002152_0029_0FBC781BF1DC9E30"/>
most forceable Reasons and Motives will have very little Influence upon them. Thus when Men's Minds are filled with Prejudices against Religion and Godli∣ness, and the Idols of Sin and the World are set up in their Hearts, if they be urged with the strongest Arguments to forsake those, and live Religiously; they will be ready to say with those in Jer. 2.25. <HI>No, for we have loved strangers, and after them we will go.</HI> They cannot now <HI>Hearken to the voice of the charmers, charming never so wisely,</HI> Psal. 58.5.</P>
<P>I SHALL mention one thing more, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>DRUNKENNESS.</HI> How evidently does this unfit such as are addicted to it, for being treated as Persons that can use their Reason and Understanding well? How unfit are Drunken Men to be argued withal as with Reasonable Creatures? Such as are actually Drunk are indeed more like Beasts then Men. <HI>They are like the Horse and Mule that have no understanding,</HI> Psal. 32.9. Nay rather like some other Beasts, with which wicked Men are compared in Scripture, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.22. When Persons are Drunk, they are unfit to be treated by Men in a Rational way, about the Affairs of this Life; and how much more unfit are they to be treated by the Blessed GOD, about the Affairs of their Immortal Souls, and the Eternal World? Can we think Drunken Men fit to be spoken unto by a Wise and Holy GOD, as GOD speaks to Men in our Text, <HI>Come now, and let us Reason together, saith the Lord</HI>? No truely, they are very far from it. Yet some that are given to Drunkenness are scarce ever willing to Discourse about the things of GOD and their Souls, but when they are Drunk, and so utterly unfit to be treated about them.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all; for those that do frequently inflame and intoxicate themselves with Strong Drink,
<PB N="29" REF="002152_0030_0FBC781D1B2D6D90"/>
do generally, if not always so stepify their Senses, and impair their Understandings by it (though they themselves know it not,) as almost to unfit them∣selves to be treated as Rational Creatures at any Time.</P>
<P>LET therefore such as <HI>Rise up early in the Morning, that they may follow after Strong-Drink, and continue until Night, till Wine inflame them,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> 5.11.</NOTE> seriously consider, when they are in such a condition as to be capable of it, how much worse than Bruits they are frequently making themselves; and how much it concerns them to Reform their Lives, before they so far lose the use of their Understandings, as to be uncapable of receiving any Benefit by those Rational Methods, which GOD is still making use of with them.</P>
<P><HI>USE,</HI> IV. DOES GOD deal with Men as with Reasonable Creatures, <HI>Then ought Men to take great care to carry themselves as Reasonable Creatures ought to do, towards GOD, that so in the Things wherein they have to do with Him, He may have no just Reason to blame or condemn them.</HI> Since GOD is pleased to deal with Men as with Rational Creatures, certainly Men should see to it, that they carry themselves so, that Reason will justify them, whenever GOD shall call them to give an Account of their Actions, or shall enter into a Debate with them about them.</P>
<P>WE are always accountable unto GOD, for what we do; and He has many wayes to bring the Reasonableness of our Actions into Tryal. In His Word He deals with us about them. Our Con∣sciences are His Vicegerents to Judge of them, and to Justifie or condemn them. There are Men Au∣thorized by Him to examine as with respect to many
<PB N="30" REF="002152_0031_0FBC781EDBA15D40"/>
of them. There will be a Great and General Day of Judgment, wherein we must give an Account of all of them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.10. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12.14. GQD will shortly call us to an Account as Reasonable Crea∣tures, how we have behaved our selves in the World, He will bring us to a fair Tryal, that it may appear whether we can by Reason justifie our Actions and Carriages, or not. It must therefore needs greatly concern us to see to it, that our Case be good when GOD calls us to answer for our selves. We had need therefore say and resolve as in Hab 2 1. unto which I may here allude, <HI>I will stand upon my watch, and will set me upon the Tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am re∣proved,</HI> Or, as it is in the Margin, <HI>argued withal.</HI></P>
<P>INASMUCH also as GOD puts a great Honour and Respect upon Men, in His treating of them as Reaso∣nable Creatures, and deals very kindly by them; how vile a thing will it then be in Men, if they carry themselves unreasonably and bruitishly towards Him. How fitly may GOD say unto Them, as in Isa. 46.8. <HI>Shew your selves Men.</HI> GOD justly expects that we should behave our selves suitably to the dignity of our Natures, and to the honourable Way of His treating of us, and how base and unworthy shall we shew our selves, if our carriage and deportment towards Him be wholly Unanswerable to His dealings with us, and expectations concerning us? GOD justly complains of Men, when they carry it not towards Him as Reasonable Creatures ought to do, Jer. 4.22. <HI>My People are foolish, they have not known me, they are sottish Children and have none Understanding, they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no Knowledge.</HI> And Jer. 8.7. <HI>The Stork in the Heavens knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle and the Crane and the Swallow, observe the Time of their coming; but my People know not the Judgment of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002152_0032_0FBC7823A0CBB8B0"/>IT is then highly necessary, that we do endeavour in all points to behave our selves towards a Wise and Holy GOD, as does become Reasonable Crea∣tures; and those that are by Him treated as such, to do: And as such we are Obliged wisely to consider such things as these, and thus to Argue with our selves.</P>
<P>HAVE we not Reason to believe that there is an Eternal GOD of Infinite Perfections, who has Cre∣ated the World, and all things therein? How else came all these Things, which we behold, by their Being?</P>
<P>HAVE we not Reason to believe that GOD made Reasonable Creatures, to render unto Him a Reasona∣ble Service? Such as He made them capable of, and that He would therefore, some way or other make known His Mind and Will to them?</P>
<P>HAVE we not Reason to believe that the Scriptures are of Divine Original? Or were given by Inspiration of GOD, to direct Reasonable Creatures in their Duty towards Him? Is there not the stamp of His Autho∣rity upon them? Are they not worthy of such a One as He is, and every way suitable to such an End, as to teach Men how they may Glorify GOD, and come to the Enjoyment of Him?</P>
<P>IS there not good Reason that Men should firmly believe all that GOD does in the Scriptures say unto them; yea, tho' they cannot comprehend some of the Mysteries therein delivered? And is not their Sin great, if they make Him a Lyar, by not believing what He speaks, and testifies unto them?</P>
<P>IS it not good Reason that we should Obey the Laws of the Great <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> which are in His Word given unto us? Or should not He that Made
<PB N="32" REF="002152_0033_0FBC78247A8D0380"/>
us, and Continually Keeps us, also Rule and Govern us?</P>
<P>HAVE we not abundant Reason to acknowledge that Mankind have fallen from GOD by Sinning a∣gainst Him, and so become justly liable to innumera∣ble, and endless Miseries?</P>
<P>HAVE we not Reason to believe the Record that GOD has, in the Gospel, given of His SON? Should we not look upon it as <HI>a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners?</HI> 1 Tim. 1.15.</P>
<P>HAVE we not Reason to Esteem the Terms of Peace propounded in the Gospel, as very Reasonable, and very Gracious? Or have we the least Reason to think that GOD dealeth hardly with us, in holding us unto such Terms? This is the case that GOD invites Men to Reason with Him about in the Text, as by the Con∣text does appear.</P>
<P>IS it not a most Reasonable thing, that Sinners should sincerely Repent of their many Sins against the blessed GOD, and turn to Him from them with all their Hearts and Souls; and that they should wil∣lingly accept the Terms of Peace offered to them thro' a Redeemer? And is not their folly exceeding great, if they refuse thus to do?</P>
<P>FINALLY, Have we not good Reason to acknow∣ledge, that if Men disobey and dishonour the Great GOD; if they despise His Authority, and will not hearken to His Voice; if they will reject His Mercy, and not believe in His Son; but trample His pre∣cious Blood under foot, and utterly refuse that He should Rule over them. Have we not then I say, good Reason to confess that GOD will be very Just in
<PB N="33" REF="002152_0034_0FBC78267B12F0A8"/>
bringing His wrath upon them unto the uttermost, &amp; in <HI>Raining on them Snares, Fire &amp; Brimstone, &amp; an horrible Tem∣pest</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 11.6.</NOTE> and in <HI>punishing them with everlasting Destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of His Power,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1.9.</NOTE> that, <HI>As He has called, and they have refused, stretched out His hands, and they not regarded it; but set at nought, His Counsels, and would none of His Reproofs</HI>; so <HI>He also should laugh at their Calamity, and mock when their Fear cometh, when their Fear cometh as Desolation, and their Destruction as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish cometh upon them,</HI> Prov. 1.24, — 27.</P>
<P>HOW necessary is it that Men as Rational Beings, should seriously ponder such things as these, and af∣fect their Hearts with the consideration of them? <HI>O that they were wise and would so do, that they would con∣sider their latter end.</HI> Deut. 32.29.</P>
<P>BUT how has Men's Apostacy from the Blessed GOD depraved their Souls, and unfitted them for the due exercise of those Faculties and Powers, which as Rational Beings, they are endued withal! Man is now in his Natural Estate, after a sort, beside himself, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.17. His understanding being darkned, he is <HI>Alienated from the Life of God, thro' the Ignorance that is in him, because of the blindness of his heart,</HI> Eph. 4.18. He therefore <HI>Receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, but they are foolishness unto him, nor can he know them because they are spiritually discerned,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.14.</P>
<P>IN Order therefore unto Men's coming to their Right Minds, and being actually prepared for the due Exercise of those Powers, with which as Reasonable Creatures they are endued: They must have a super∣natural Change wrought in them by the special Ope∣ration
<PB N="34" REF="002152_0035_0FBC782780827E40"/>
of the Holy Ghost; They must be <HI>Renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of Him that Created them,</HI> Col. 3.10.</P>
<P>WE must therefore Pray unto the GOD of all Grace, to <HI>Open the Eyes of our Minds</HI> for us, and <HI>Fill us with all Wisdom, and Spiritual Understanding</HI>: This be∣ing done for us, Right Reason will then Influence and Govern us; and GOD's way of treating us as Reasonable Creatures, will have a good Effect upon us. And then we shall be prevailed withal, to <HI>Present our selves a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto Him; which is our Reasonable Service.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Brief Account of the State of the <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> and the small Islands Adjacent in <HI>Duke's-Country,</HI> from the Year <HI>1694</HI> to <HI>1720.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>MArtha's Vineyard</HI> is an Island lying in about the Latitude of 41. and is about 22 Miles in length, from East to West, <HI>Chapaquidick</HI> and <HI>Capoag,</HI> near adjoyning at the East end, being included; the said Island being about 8 Miles in breadth towards the East end of it, and about 3 towards the West end, but the Soil of much of it, is very barren and uncultivated. The Sound on the North-side is about 3 Leagues over, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>Falmouth</HI> on the Main, and to <HI>Elsabeth's</HI>-Islands, which lye South-Westward of <HI>Falmouth.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Gayhead</HI> at the West end of the Island, to <HI>Rhode-Island</HI>; it is about 12 Leagues, and from <HI>Edgartown</HI> Harbour at the East end of it, to <HI>Nantucket</HI>; is as Vessels sail, about 10.</P>
<P>The Island called <HI>No-mans-land</HI> lies South-ward from the West end of <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> about 4 Miles from the <HI>Gayhead.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002152_0037_0FBC782CB86531E0"/>Concerning the Conversion of the <HI>Indians</HI> on these Islands, and places adjacent on the Main, there was a brief Narrative written by <HI>Matthew Mayhew,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Eldest Son of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Mayhew,</HI> who first Preached the Gospel unto them; which Narrative was Printed at <HI>Boston</HI> in the Year 1694. and Re∣printed at <HI>London</HI> the next Year, under the Title of, <HI>The Conquests and Triumphs of Grace,</HI> &amp;c. The same, for Substance, being again Printed some Years after, in Dr. <HI>C. Mather's</HI> History of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>I shall begin my Account of the State of the <HI>Indians</HI> from the time the said Book was first Published, that being about the time that I first began to Preach to them.</P>
<P>The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> on these Islands is very much diminished, since the <HI>English</HI> first settled on <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> which was in the Year 1642 there being then as was supposed on that Island about 1500 Souls. At present there are in the <HI>Vineyard</HI> six small Villages, contain∣ing in all of them, about 155 Families, and the Number of Souls may be about eight hundred.</P>
<P>Each of these Villages is provided with an <HI>Indian</HI> Preacher to dispence the Word to them on the Lord's Days, when I am not with them. They meet for the Worship of GOD twice a Day on the Sabbath, and after Prayer, sing a Psalm; then there is a Sermon Preached on
<PB N="3" REF="002152_0038_0FBC782E417B2680"/>
some Portion of Scripture, which being ended▪ they sing again; while the Days be of a suffi∣cient length; and then conclude with Prayer.</P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Indians</HI> on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> there is a small Assembly on <HI>Winthrop's</HI> Island, the Eastermost of <HI>Elsabeth's</HI> Islands before men∣tioned; and these also have ordinarily an In∣dian Minister to Preach the Word of GOD to them, and Mr. <HI>John Weeks</HI> an <HI>Englishman</HI> for∣merly Preached to them; but has lately, as I am informed, desisted from that Work.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tucker's</HI>-Island, &amp; at <HI>Nashaun</HI> or <HI>Slocum's</HI> Island, which lie near together, Westward of <HI>Winthrop's</HI> Island, are about 12 or 14 Families, and these, tho' their Number be small, are provided with an Indian Preacher.</P>
<P>At the before mentioned <HI>No-mans-land,</HI> there are now so few Indians left, that they have none to Preach constantly to them.</P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Indian Assemblies</HI> already men∣tioned, there is one Assembly of <HI>Anabaptists</HI> at the <HI>Gayhead</HI>; but the number of People belong∣ing unto this, is very inconsiderable.</P>
<P>Tho' there are many <HI>Indians</HI> on these Islands, who are very negligent as to their Attendance on the Publick Worship of GOD; yet I know of none, but what do make some Profession of Religion, and will talk soberly, when treated withal about it; having made a trial on some that have been most suspected.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002152_0039_0FBC782FB552BDD8"/>And tho' there are among these <HI>Indians,</HI> a great many who are very defective in their Morals; yet there are a considerable number, even of those not yet joyned in Church Com∣munion, who live soberly, and Worship GOD in their Families.</P>
<P>There has, from time to time, been much care taken that the several Villages might be provided with School-Masters to teach the Children to Read and Write; yet some of them have not been so constantly supplied, as is to be desired; and generally when the Spring of the Year comes on, the Indians take their Chil∣dren from School, alleging they want them for Tillage of the Land; and so the Schools fail till the Fall; and this has much hindred their Progress in Learning: Nevertheless, I think the greatest number can Read, either in the <HI>English</HI> or in the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue; and some in both.</P>
<P>There is also care taken to <HI>Catechise</HI> the Youth, For besides what is done in this kind, by the <HI>Indian</HI> School-Masters &amp; Preachers, I frequent∣ly examine the Young People my self, and have determined to attend this Service once a Fort∣night, in some or other of the forementioned Villages; and this Method will I hope, prove very advantageous, many grown People as well as Children, attending these Exercises.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002152_0040_0FBC78339798DCF0"/>The <HI>Indian</HI> Church at <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> whereof Mr. <HI>Japheth Hannit</HI> an excellent <HI>In∣dian Minister</HI> was formerly the Pastor, but died in the Year 1712. had after his Death another Pastor, called <HI>Sowomog</HI>: but he being an Old Man when he was first called unto that Office, lived but a very few Years.</P>
<P>The Name of the present Pastor of that Church is <HI>Joash Panu,</HI> who is a very serious prudent &amp; pious Man, of a good Conversation, and one who drinks no strong drink, but is much grieved at those of his Country-men who do err by means of it. If it please GOD to continue his Life, he is like to prove a good Instrument; but being lately fallen in∣to a Languishing Distemper, I fear what the issue of it may be.</P>
<P>The number of Communicants, both Men and Women, in this Church, is about 110. the most of these are Inhabitants of <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> but not all; there being a few that have joyned themselves there unto, not only from <HI>Elsabeth</HI>'s Islands, but from the Main Land also, lying next unto the <HI>Vineyard.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord's Supper is ordinarily Admini∣stred in that Church about 7 or 8 times in a Year, and Discipline is in some measure kept up in it. Unto this End, besides other Church Meetings, there is constantly on the <HI>Thursday</HI> or <HI>Friday</HI> before that Sacrament is Admini∣stred,
<PB N="6" REF="002152_0041_0FBC78359312EB58"/>
a Meeting of the Church, wherein such are suspended from the Lords Table as having been over-taken in any fault, have not given due satisfaction. At this Meeting also there is ordinarily a Sermon Preached suita∣ble to the occasion.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged that as the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> are many of them much addicted unto strong drink; so some of the Members of the Indian Church have been sometimes found very faulty, on this account; yet it is also true, that such as these have generally ap∣peared very Penitent. And tho' some have fallen quite away, and so have been cut off by the Sword of Discipline; yet others thro' the Grace of GOD, have been so far recove∣red out of the Sins into which they have fallen, as that it may be hoped they will not again return to them; and there have all along been, and still are, a considerable num∣ber, whose Conversation is, so far as I can un∣derstand, very blameless, and who may be justly looked upon as Exemplary Christians; what ever such <HI>English Men</HI> as are filled with Prejudices against the <HI>Indians,</HI> may say to the contrary.</P>
<P>Some Years after I first began to Preach to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> on <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> did on a day of <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> appointed for that End, solemnly renew their Covenant
<PB N="7" REF="002152_0042_0FBC7836A8D13FD0"/>
with GOD, engaging to endeavour to forsake those Sins with which they confessed they were too easily beset; and there was after this, for a Time, some Reformation: but I observed that two or three of the Brethren that could not be perswaded to joyn in the Action, soon after fell into Scandalous Mis∣demeanours.</P>
<P>I also observed, That after the Church had thus renewed their Covenant, the Means of Grace offered unto the <HI>Indians,</HI> seemed for a time to be attended with more of the Pre∣sence of GOD, and the Influences of His Spi∣rit, than they were before, or have been since.</P>
<P>It was then frequent to see Persons at the Hearing of Sermons, very much affected, and some times as soon as Sermon was ended, there would stand up several, one after ano∣ther, and make very Penitential Confessions of their Sins, with Promises to endeavour to Live new Lives, desiring also the Prayers of the People of GOD for them.</P>
<P>About this time there joyned in full Com∣munion unto that small Church on the <HI>Vine∣yard,</HI> in one Year, at least 30 Persons, the be∣havour of many of whom did very much re∣semble that of the Jailor, at his Conversion, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. GOD shewing us herein that He can make the <HI>Indians</HI> as well as Others a <HI>willing People in the Day of His Power.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002152_0043_0FBC7837F4CAE098"/>There is an Increase of Knowledge among these <HI>Indians,</HI> tho' it must be confessed that their progress herein is but slow, by reason of the want of a Learned Ministry constantly to Instruct them. Their ordinary Preachers ha∣ving but little Learning, are not so able to feed them with Knowledge and Understand∣ing as is to be desired; yet some of these have Gifts not to be despised in <HI>a day of small things.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Indian</HI> Ministers as they are Mem∣bers in full Communion of the Church on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> so they do not engage in the work of the Ministry without the Consent &amp; Ap∣probation of that Church, as well as of the <HI>English</HI> Ministers that Preach unto the Indi∣ans, and have an Inspection over them.</P>
<P>Having now Preached to the <HI>Indians</HI> up∣ward of Twenty-five Years, I have never yet had any special charge of any one single Con∣gregation committed to me; but have visited the several fore-mentioned Assemblies alter∣nately, as I have thought most necessary; Preaching ordinarily, unto some or other of them every Lord's Day, and on working days once a Fortnight; constantly also attending their Church-Meetings, to assist &amp; direct them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> when they are Sick, generally send for their Ministers, and some times other Christians with them, to visit them and Pray with, and for them. I have some times
<PB N="9" REF="002152_0044_0FBC783BA0EA6828"/>
been with them on such occasions, and heard them profess a great concern about their Souls; declaring that they did not regard any thing in this World, so they might ob∣tain an Interest in GOD's Favour; and I have known many of them who have professed a good hope thro' CHRIST in their Death, and who have behaved themselves on all accounts as does become dying Saints; nor have I any doubt, but that many of them have died in the Lord.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Josiah Torrey,</HI> Pastor of the <HI>English</HI> Church in <HI>Tisbury</HI> on the <HI>Vine∣yard</HI> has also for many Years past Preached as a Lecturer unto the <HI>Indians</HI> on that Island, having for that End learned their Language. He Preacheth in some or other of their As∣semblies once a Fortnight, and goes frequent∣ly to their Church-Meetings, to advise and assist them; so that the <HI>Indians</HI> have a Ser∣mon every <HI>Thursday</HI> Preached to them, either by Mr. <HI>Torrey,</HI> or my self: And we strengthen the hands of one another, by going together to these Weekly Exercises.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Samuel Wiswall</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Edgartown,</HI> has also now almost learned the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue, with a design to do what Service he can among that People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Martha's Vineyard</HI> and the adjacent Islands, do hitherto understand the
<PB N="10" REF="002152_0045_0FBC783E089762F8"/>
<HI>Indian</HI> Tongue much better than that of the <HI>English</HI>; and therefore complain much for want of <HI>Indian</HI> BIBLES, having now but very few among them. Nor are there any to be had; the last Edition being now gone. These <HI>Indians</HI> are therefore very desirous of another Impression of the Bible, if it might be obtained; and divers of them have told me, as well as some of those on <HI>Nantucket,</HI> (whom I have divers times visited) that they should be willing according to their capaci∣ty, to contribute to it.</P>
<P>But the disadvantage which the <HI>Indians</HI> are under thro' the Scarcity of BIBLES is some-what helped by the Care of the Ho∣nourable Commissioners to supply them with other useful Books in their own Lan∣guage, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>New-England</HI> Confession of Faith; Several Catechisms; The Practice of Piety; Mr. <HI>Shepard's</HI> Sincere Convert; Mr. <HI>Baxter's</HI> Call to the Unconverted. And seve∣ral Sermon Books of Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s, &amp;c. besides the Psalter, and the Gospel of JOHN, Prin∣ted in the Year 1709. And the <HI>Indian</HI> Primer Printed this Year, in <HI>Indian</HI> &amp; <HI>English.</HI> All which Books are now very useful unto them.</P>
<P>As to their Civil Government, the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Dukes</HI> County, (as well as in other Places) are wholly under the <HI>English</HI>;
<PB N="11" REF="002152_0046_0FBC783F82570F60"/>
But because their State does yet somewhat differ from that of their <HI>English</HI> Neighbours, there are several Laws made by the General Court of this <HI>Province,</HI> with a particular re∣gard to the <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitants of the same: And there are some <HI>English</HI> Justices especial∣ly Commissionated to take care of the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> Inhabiting the several Counties of it; and <HI>these</HI> are directed to Nominate and Ap∣point several Officers among the <HI>Indians</HI> them∣selves, to assist under their regulation, in the Government of that People.</P>
<P>In <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kes</HI> County, <HI>Thomas Mayhew</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Se∣cond Son of the fore-mentioned Mr. <HI>Thomas Mayhew,</HI> who first Preached to the <HI>Indians</HI> on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> was long improved in the Go∣vernment of the <HI>Indians</HI> there, and was both singularly Spirited &amp; Accomplished for that Service; as he was on divers other accounts, a very excellent Person: But he finished his course <HI>July</HI> 21. 1715. And his Son <HI>Zacheus Mayhew</HI> succeeding him in that necessary but troublesome Office and Imployment, does good Service in it.</P>
<P>There are yet but few <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Martha</HI>'s-<HI>Vineyard</HI> that have Houses of the <HI>English</HI> fashion, tho' the number of these is of late increased; but in respect of their Apparel, they are generally Cloathed as the English are, and they by degrees learn the English
<PB N="12" REF="002152_0047_0FBC7841473E7630"/>
way of Husbandry: Several of them have good Teams of Oxen, with which they Plough and Cart, for themselves and Neighbours, as the English do. Many of them have also Horses, Cows, Sheep and Swine. They have also among them some that have learned Trades; as at <HI>Martha's-Vineyard</HI> there are several Weavers, One or two House-Carpen∣ters, One Wheel-wright, who is so good a Work-man, as to be frequently employed by his English Neighbours. There are several Tailors, and one if not more Shoe-makers, and one Black-smith, who not only took his Trade himself, but also made his Bellows, and other Tools; and one Cooper, <HI>viz. Wil∣liam Charles,</HI> who is a good Work-man. And tho' some of these may not be so accurate as our English Trades-men, yet this shews that as the <HI>Indians</HI> are capable of Learning such Callings as <HI>English</HI> Men follow; so they be∣gin to come to it.</P>
