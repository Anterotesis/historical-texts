<HEAD>THE TESTIMONY OF FRIENDS IN YORKSHIRE, At their Quarterly-Meeting, held at YORK the 24th and 25th of the third month, 1773, concerning JOHN WOOLMAN, Of Mount-Holly, in the province of New-Jersey in America, who departed this life at the house of our friend Thomas Priestman, in the suburbs of this city, the 7th of the tenth month, 1772, and was interred in the bury∣ing ground of friends the 9th of the same, aged about fifty two years.</HEAD>
<P>THIS our valuable friend having been under a religious engagement for some time, to visit friends in this nation, and more especially us in the northern parts, under∣took the same in full concurrence and near sympathy with his friends and brethren at home, as appeared by certificates from the monthly and quarterly meetings to which he belonged, and from the spring-meeting of ministers and elders, held at Philadelphia, for Pennsylvania and New-Jersey.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="013782_0003_0F91A7627A810148"/>
He arrived in the city of London the be∣ginning of the last yearly meeting, and after attending that meeting travelled northward, visiting the quarterly meetings of Hertford∣shire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Worcestershire, and divers particular meetings in his way.</P>
<P>He visited many meetings on the West side of this county, also some in Lancashire and Westmoreland, from whence he came to our quarterly meeting in the last ninth month, and though much out of health, yet was en∣abled to attend all the sittings of that meet∣ing except the last.</P>
<P>His disorder then, which proved the small pox, increased speedily upon him, and was very afflicting; under which he was support∣ed in much meekness, patience, and christi∣an fortitude; to those who attended him in his illness, his mind appeared to be centered in divine love; under the precious influence whereof, we believe he finished his course, and entered into the mansions of everlasting rest.</P>
<P>In the early part of his illness he requested a friend to write, and he broke forth thus.</P>
<P>"O Lord my God! the amazing horrors of darkness were gathered around me and co∣vered me all over, and I saw no way to go forth; I felt the misery of my fellow crea∣tures separated from the divine harmony and it was heavier than I could bear, and I was crushed down under it; I lifted up my hand, and stretched out my arm, but there was
<PB N="v" REF="013782_0004_0F91A7632E975E40"/>
none to help me; I looked round about and was amazed: in the depths of misery, O Lord! I remembered that thou art omnipo∣tent, that I had called thee father, and I felt that I loved thee, and I was made quiet in thy will, and I waited for deliverance from thee; thou hadst pity upon me, when no man could help me; I saw that meekness under suffering was shewed to us in the most affect∣ing example of thy son, and thou wast teach∣ing me to follow him, and I said, thy Will, O Father be done."</P>
<P>Many more of his weighty expressions might have been inserted here, but it was deemed unnecessary, they being already pub∣lished in print.</P>
<P>He was a man endued with a large natural capacity, and being obedient to the mani∣festations of Divine Grace, having in patience and humility endured many deep baptisms, he became thereby sanctified and fitted for the Lord's work, and was truly serviceable in his church; dwelling in awful fear and watchfulness, he was careful in his public appearances to feel the putting forth of the Divine Hand, so that the spring of the gospel ministry often flowed through him with great sweetness and purity, as a refreshing stream to the weary travellers towards the city of God: ski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lfull in dividing the word, he was furnished by Him in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, to com∣municate freely to the several states of the
<PB N="vi" REF="013782_0005_0F91A763EF1540D0"/>
people where his lot was cast. His conduct at other times was seasoned with the like watchful circumspection and attention to the guidance of Divine Wisdom, which rendered his whole conversation uniformly edifying.</P>
<P>He was fully persuaded that as the life of Christ comes to reign in the earth, all abuse and unnecessary oppression, both of the hu∣man and brute creation will come to an end; but under the sense of a deep revolt, and an overflowing stream of unrighteousness, his life has been often a life of mourning.</P>
<P>He was deeply concerned on account of that inhuman and iniquitous practice of making slaves of the people of Africa, or holding them in that state; and on that ac∣count we understand he hath not only wrote some books, but travelled much on the con∣tinent of America, in order to make the Ne∣gro masters (especially those in profession with us) sensible of the evil of such a practice; and though in this journey to England, he was far removed from the outward sight of their sufferings, yet his deep exercise of mind re∣mained, as appears by a short treatise he wrote in this journey, and his frequent con∣cern to open the miserable state of this deep∣ly injured people: his testimony in the last meeting he attended was on this subject, wherein he remarked, that as we as a society, when under outward sufferings had often found it our concern to lay them before those in authority, and thereby in the Lord's time,
<PB N="vii" REF="013782_0006_0F91A765EB7D6C40"/>
had obtained relief, so he recommended this oppressed part of the creation to our notice, that we may as way may open, represent their sufferings in an individual, if not a so∣ciety, capacity to those in authority.</P>
<P>Deeply sensible that the desire to gratify people's inclinations in luxury and superflui∣ties, is the principal ground of oppression, and the occasion of many unnecessary wants, he believed it to be his duty to be a pattern of great self-denial, with respect to the things of this life, and earnestly to labour with friends in the meekness of wisdom, to im∣press on their minds the great importance of our testimony in these things, recommending to the guidance of the blessed Truth in this and all other concerns, and cautioning such as are experienced therein, against contenting themselves with acting up to the standard of others, but to be careful to make the stand∣ard of truth manifested to them, the measure of their obedience; for said he, "That pu∣rity of life which proceeds from faithfulness in following the Spirit of Truth, that state where our minds are devoted to serve God, and all our wants are bounded by his wis∣dom; this habitation has often been opened before me as a place of retirement for the children of the light, where they may stand separated from that which disordereth and confuseth the affairs of society, and where we may have a testimony of our innocence in the hearts of those who behold us."</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="013782_0007_0F91A76663403350"/>
We conclude with fervent desires, that we as a people may thus, by our example, pro∣mote the Lord's work in the earth; and our hearts being prepared, may unite in prayer to the great Lord of the harvest, that as in his infinite wisdom he hath greatly stripped the church, by removing of late divers faith∣ful ministers and elders, he may be pleased to send forth many more faithful labourers into his harvest.</P>

<HEAD>A TESTIMONY OF THE MONTHLY-MEETING OF FRIENDS, Held in Burlington, the first day of the eighth month, in the year of our Lord, 1774, concerning our esteemed friend JOHN WOOLMAN, DECEASED.</HEAD>
<P>HE was born in Northampton, in the county of Burlington, and province of West-New-Jersey, in the eighth month, 1720, of religious parents, who instructed him very early in the principles of the christian religi∣on, as professed by the people called Quakers, which he esteemed a blessing to him, even in his young years, tending to preserve him from the infection of wicked children; but through the workings of the enemy, and le∣vity incident to youth, he frequently deviated from those parental precepts, by which he laid a renewed foundation for repentance, that was finally succeeded by a godly sorrow not to be repented of, and so became ac∣quainted with that sanctifying power which qualifies for true gospel ministry, into which he was called about the twenty-second year of his age, and by a faithful use of the ta∣lents committed to him, he experienced an encrease, until he arrived at the state of a fa∣ther,
<PB N="x" REF="013782_0009_0F91A769BB747198"/>
capable of dividing the word aright to the different states he ministered unto; dis∣pensing milk to babes, and meat to those of riper years. Thus he found the efficacy of that power to arise, which in his own ex∣pressions, "prepares the creature to stand like a trumpet through which the Lord speaks to his people."—He was a loving husband, a tender father, and very humane to every part of the creation under his care.</P>
<P>His concern for the poor and those in af∣fliction was evident by his visits to them; whom he frequently relieved by his assistance and charity. He was for many years deeply exercised on account of the poor enslaved A∣fricans, whose cause, as he sometimes men∣tioned, lay almost continually upon him, and to obtain liberty to those captives, he la∣boured both in public and private; and was favoured to see his endeavours crowned with considerable success. He was particularly desirous that friends should not be instru∣mental to lay burthens on this oppressed peo∣ple, but remember the days of suffering from which they had been providentially delivered, that if times of trouble should return, no in∣justice dealt to those in slavery might rise in judgment against us, but, being clear, we might on such occasions address the Almigh∣ty with a degree of confidence, for his inter∣position and relief, being particularly careful as to himself, not to countenance slavery even by the use of those conveniencies of life which were furnished by their labour.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="013782_0010_0F91A76AB1228590"/>
He was desirous to have his own, and the minds of others, redeemed from the pleasures and immoderate profits of this world, and to fix them on those joys which fade not away; his principal care being after a life of purity, endeavouring to avoid not only the grosser pollutions, but those also which, appearing in a more refined dress, are not sufficiently guarded against by some well disposed peo∣ple. In the latter part of his life he was re∣markable for the plainness and simplicity of his dress, and as much as possible, avoided the use of plate, costly furniture and feasting; thereby endeavouring to become an example of temperance and self-denial, which he be∣lieved himself called unto; and was favour∣ed with peace therein, altho' it carried the appearance of great austerity in the view of some. He was very moderate in his charges in the way of business, and in his desires af∣ter gain; and tho' a man of industry, avoid∣ed, and strove much to lead others out of ex∣treme labour, and anxiousness after perishable things; being desirous that the strength of our bodies might not be spent in procuring things unprofitable, and that we might use moderation and kindness to the brute animals under our care, to prize the use of them as a great favour, and by no means abuse them; that the gifts of Providence should be thank∣fully received and applied to the uses they were designed.</P>
<P>He several times opened a school at Mount-Holly, for the instruction of poor friends
<PB N="xii" REF="013782_0011_0F91A76B73BC6668"/>
children and others, being concerned for their help and improvement therein:—his love and care for the rising youth among us was truly great, recommending to parents and those who have the charge of them, to chuse con∣scientious and pious tutors, saying, "It is a lovely sight to behold innocent children," and that "to labour for their help against that which would marr the beauty of their minds, is a debt we owe them."</P>
<P>His ministry was sound, very deep and pe∣netrating, sometimes pointing out the dan∣gerous situation which indulgence and cus∣tom leads into; frequently exhorting others, especially the youth, not to be discouraged at the difficulties which occur, but press after purity. He often expressed an earnest en∣gagement that <HI>pure wisdom</HI> should be attend∣ed to, which would lead into lowliness of mind and resignation to the divine will, in which state small possessions here would be sufficient.</P>
<P>In transacting the affairs of discipline, his judgment was sound and clear, and he was very useful in treating with those who had done amiss; he visited such in a private way in that plainness which truth dictates, shewing great tenderness and christian for∣bearance. He was a constant attender of our yearly-meeting, in which he was a good ex∣ample, and particularly useful; assisting in the business thereof with great weight and at∣tention. He several times visited most of the meetings of friends in this and the neigh∣bouring
<PB N="xiii" REF="013782_0012_0F91A76C30754218"/>
provinces, with the concurrence of the monthly-meeting to which he belonged, and we have reason to believe had good ser∣vice therein, generally or always expressing at his return how it had fared with him, and the evidence of peace in his mind for thus performing his duty. He was often concern∣ed with other friends in the important service of visiting families, which he was enabled to go through to satisfaction.</P>
<P>In the minutes of the meeting of ministers and elders for this quarter, at the foot of a list of the members of that meeting, made about five years before his death, we find in his hand writing the following observation and reflections. "As looking over the mi∣nutes made by persons who have put off this body, hath sometimes revived in me a thought how ages pass away; so this list may proba∣bly revive a like thought in some, when I and the rest of the persons abovenamed, are cen∣tered in another state of being.—The Lord, who was the guide of my youth, hath in ten∣der mercies helped me hitherto; he hath healed me of wounds, he hath helped me out of grievous entanglements; he remains to be the strength of my life; to whom I desire to devote myself in time, and in eternity."—<HI>Signed,</HI> John Woolman.</P>
<P>In the twelfth month, 1771, he acquaint∣ed this meeting that he found his mind drawn towards a religious visit to friends in some parts of England, particularly in Yorkshire. In the first month 1772, he obtained our cer∣tificate, which was approved and endorsed by
<PB N="xiv" REF="013782_0013_0F91A76E261DE388"/>
our quarterly meeting, and by the half year's meeting of ministers and elders at Philadel∣phia. He embarked on his voyage in the fifth, and arrived in London in the sixth month following, at the time of their annual meeting in that city. During his short visit to friends in that kingdom, we are informed that his services were acceptable and edifying. In his last illness he uttered many lively and comfortable expressions, being "perfectly resigned, having no will either to live or die," as appears by the testimony of friends at York in Great-Britain, in the suburbs whereof, at the house of our friend Thomas Priestman, he died of the small-pox, on the seventh day of the tenth month, 1772, and was buried in friends burying ground in that city, on the ninth of the same, after a large and solid meeting held on the occasion, at their great meeting-house, aged near fifty-two years; a minister upwards of thirty years, during which time he belonged to Mount-Holly particular meeting, which he diligently at∣tended when at home and in health of body, and his labours of love and pious care for the prosperity of friends in the blessed truth, we hope may not be forgotten, but that his good works may be remembered to edification.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>His birth and parentage, with some account of the operations of divine grace on his mind in his youth—His first appearance in the mini∣stry—And his considerations, while young, on the keeping of slaves.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I HAVE often felt a motion of love to leave some hints in writing of my ex∣perience of the goodness of God: and now, in the thirty-sixth year of my age, I begin this work.</P>
<P>I was born in Northampton, in Burling∣ton county, West-Jersey, in the Year 1720; and before I was seven years old I began to
<PB N="2" REF="013782_0016_0F91A7701C9DC670"/>
be acquainted with the operations of divine love. Through the care of my parents, I was taught to read near as soon as I was capable of it; and as I went from school one seventh day, I remember, while my companions went to play by the way, I went forward out of sight, and sitting down, I read the 22d chap∣ter of the Revelations. <Q>He shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as chry∣stal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, &amp;c.</Q> and in reading it, my mind was drawn to seek after that pure habitation, which, I then believed, God had prepared for his servants. The place where I sate, and the sweetness that attended my mind, remains fresh in my memory.</P>
<P>This, and the like gracious visitations, had that effect upon me, that when boys used ill language, it troubled me; and, through the continued mercies of God, I was pre∣served from it.</P>
<P>The pious instructions of my parents were often fresh in my mind when I happened to be among wicked children, and were of use to me. My parents, having a large family of children, used frequently, on first days after meeting, to put us to read in the holy scriptures, or some religious books, one after another, the rest sitting by without much conversation; which, I have since often thought, was a good practice. From what I had read and heard, I believed there had been, in past ages, peo∣ple who walked in uprightness before God, in a degree exceeding any that I knew, or
<PB N="3" REF="013782_0017_0F91A770AC8FD640"/>
heard of, now living: and the apprehension of there being less steadiness and firmness amongst people in this age than in past ages, often troubled me while I was a child.</P>
<P>A thing remarkable in my childhood was, that once going to a neighbour's house, I saw, on the way, a robin sitting on her nest, and as I came near she went off, but having young ones flew about, and with many cries expressed her concern for them; I stood and threw stones at her, till one strik∣ing her, she fell down dead: at first I was pleased with the exploit, but after a few mi∣nutes was seized with horror, as having, in a sportive way, killed an innocent creature while she was careful for her young: I be∣held her lying dead, and thought those young ones, for which she was so careful, must now perish for want of their dam to nourish them; and after some painful considerations on the subject, I climbed up the tree, took all the young birds, and killed them; supposing that better than to leave them to pine away and die miserably: and believed, in this case, that scripture proverb was fulfilled, <Q>The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</Q> I then went on my errand, but, for some hours, could think of little else but the cru∣elties I had committed, and was much trou∣bled. Thus He, whose tender mercies are over all his works, hath placed a principle in the human mind, which incites to exer∣cise goodness towards every living creature; and this being singly attended to, people
<PB N="4" REF="013782_0018_0F91A773DF262EA0"/>
become tender-hearted and sympathizing; but being frequently and totally rejected, the mind becomes shut up in a contrary dispo∣sition.</P>
<P>About the twelfth year of my age, my father being abroad, my mother reproved me for some misconduct, to which I made an undutiful reply; and the next first day, as I was with my father returning from meeting, he told me he understood I had behaved amiss to my mother, and advised me to be more careful in future. I knew myself blameable, and in shame and confu∣sion remained silent. Being thus awakened to a sense of my wickedness, I felt remorse in my mind, and getting home, I retired and prayed to the Lord to forgive me; and do not remember that I ever, after that, spoke unhandsomely to either of my parents, how∣ever foolish in some other things.</P>
<P>Having attained the age of sixteen years, I began to love wanton company; and though I was preserved from profane language, or scandalous conduct, still I perceived a plant in me which produced much wild grapes: yet my merciful Father forsook me not utterly, but at times, through his grace, I was brought seriously to consider my ways; and the sight of my backslidings affected me with sorrow; but for want of rightly attending to the re∣proofs of instruction, vanity was added to vanity, and repentance to repentance: upon the whole, my mind was more and more ali∣enated from the truth, and I hastened to∣ward
<PB N="5" REF="013782_0019_0F91A774E35FE0B0"/>
destruction. While I meditate on the gulf towards which I travelled, and reflect on my youthful disobedience, for these things I weep, mine eye runneth down with water.</P>
<P>Advancing in age the number of my ac∣quaintance increased, and thereby my way grew more difficult: though I had found comfort in reading the holy scriptures, and thinking on heavenly things, I was now estranged therefrom: I knew I was going from the flock of Christ, and had no resolu∣tion to return; hence serious reflections were uneasy to me, and youthful vanities and di∣versions my greatest pleasure. Running in this road I found many like myself; and we associated in that which is reverse to true friendship.</P>
<P>But in this swift race it pleased God to vi∣sit me with sickness, so that I doubted of recovering; and then did darkness, horror, and amazement, with full force, seize me, even when my pain and distress of body was very great. I thought it would have been better for me never to have had a being, than to see the day which I now saw. I was filled with confusion; and in great affliction, both of mind and body, I lay and bewailed my∣self. I had not confidence to lift up my cries to God, whom I had thus offended; but, in a deep sense of my great folly, I was hum∣bled before him: and, at length, that Word which is as a fire and a hammer, broke and dissolved my rebellious heart, and then my cries were put up in contrition; and in the
<PB N="6" REF="013782_0020_0F91A7753B29A140"/>
multitude of his mercies I found inward re∣lief, and felt a close engagement, that if he was pleased to restore my health, I might walk humbly before him.</P>
<P>After my recovery, this exercise remained with me a considerable time; but, by de∣grees, giving way to youthful vanities, they gained strength, and getting with wanton young people I lost ground. The Lord had been very gracious, and spoke peace to me in the time of my distress; and I now most ungratefully turned again to folly; on which account, at times, I felt sharp reproof, but did not get low enough to cry for help. I was not so hardy as to commit things scan∣dalous; but to exceed in vanity, and pro∣mote mirth, was my chief study. Still I re∣tained a love and esteem for pious people; and their company brought an awe upon me. My dear parents, several times, admonished me in the fear of the Lord, and their ad∣monition entered into my heart, and had a good effect for a season; but not getting deep enough to pray rightly, the tempter, when he came, found entrance. I remem∣ber, once having spent a part of the day in wantonness as I went to bed at night, there lay in a window, near my bed, a bible, which I opened, and first cast my eye on the text, <Q>we lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us;</Q> this I knew to be my case: and meeting with so unexpected a reproof, I was somewhat affected with it, and
<PB N="7" REF="013782_0021_0F91A775F2B36E60"/>
went to bed under remorse of conscience; which I soon cast off again.</P>
<P>Thus time past on: my heart was reple∣nished with mirth and wantonness, while pleasing scenes of vanity were presented to my imagination, till I attained the age of eighteen years; near which time I felt the judgments of God, in my soul, like a con∣suming fire; and looking over my past life, the prospect was moving.—I was often sad, and longed to be delivered from those vani∣ties; then again, my heart was strongly in∣clined to them, and there was in me a sore conflict: at times I turned to folly; and then again, sorrow and confusion took hold of me. In a while, I resolved totally to leave off some of my vanities; but there was a secret reserve in my heart, of the more refined part of them, and I was not low enough to find true peace. Thus, for some months, I had great troubles; there remaining in me an un∣subjected will, which rendered my labours fruitless, till at length, through the merciful continuance of heavenly visitations, I was made to bow down in spirit before the Lord. I remember one evening I had spent some time in reading a pious author; and walking out alone, I humbly prayed to the Lord for his help, that I might be delivered from all those vanities which so ensnared me. Thus being brought low, he helped me; and as I learned to bear the cross, I felt refreshment to come from his presence; but not keeping in that strength which gave victory, I lost ground
<PB N="8" REF="013782_0022_0F91A776C08C6D38"/>
again; the sense of which greatly affected me: and I sought deserts and lonely places, and there with tears did confess my sins to God, and humbly craved help of him. And I may say with reverence, he was near to me in my troubles, and in those times of humi∣liation opened my ear to discipline. I was now led to look seriously at the means by which I was drawn from the pure truth, and learned this, that if I would live in the life which the faithful servants of God lived in, I must not go into company as heretofore in my own will; but all the cravings of sense must be governed by a divine principle. In times of sorrow and abasement these instruc∣tions were sealed upon me, and I felt the power of Christ prevail over selfish desires, so that I was preserved in a good degree of stea∣diness; and being young, and believing, at that time, that a single life was best for me, I was strengthened to keep from such com∣pany as had often been a snare to me.</P>
<P>I kept steadily to meetings; spent first days afternoon chiefly in reading the scriptures and other good books; and was early con∣vinced in my mind, that true religion con∣sisted in an inward life, wherein the heart doth love and reverence God the Creator, and learns to exercise true justice and goodness, not only toward all men, but also toward the brute creatures—That as the mind was mov∣ed, by an inward principle, to love God as an invisible incomprehensible Being; by the same principle it was moved to love him in
<PB N="9" REF="013782_0023_0F91A7777A568648"/>
all his manifestations in the visible world—That, as by his breath, the flame of life was kindled in all animal sensible creatures, to say we love God as unseen, and, at the same time, exercise cruelty toward the least creature mov∣ing by his life, or by life derived from him; was a contradiction in itself.</P>
<P>I found no narrowness respecting sects and opinions; but believed, that sincere upright hearted people, in every society, who truly love God, were accepted of him.</P>
<P>As I lived under the cross, and simply fol∣lowed the openings of truth, my mind, from day to day, was more enlightened; my for∣mer acquaintance were left to judge of me as they would, for I found it safest for me to live in private, and keep these things sealed up in my own breast. While I silently pon∣der on that change wrought in me, I find no language equal to it, nor any means to con∣vey to another a clear idea of it. I looked upon the works of God in this visible crea∣tion, and an awfulness covered me; my heart was tender and often contrite, and universal love to my fellow-creatures increased in me: this will be understood by such who have trodden in the same path. Some glances of real beauty may be seen in their faces, who dwell in true meekness.</P>
<P>There is a harmony in the sound of that voice to which divine love gives utterance, and some appearance of right order in their temper and conduct, whose passions are re∣gulated; yet all these do not fully shew forth
<PB N="10" REF="013782_0024_0F91A7782DC335C0"/>
that inward life to such who have not felt it: but this white stone and new name is known rightly to such only who have it.</P>
<P>Now though I had been thus strengthened to bear the cross, I still found myself in great danger, having many weaknesses attending me, and strong temptations to wrestle with; in the feeling whereof I frequently withdrew into private places, and often with tears be∣sought the Lord to help me, whose gracious ear was open to my cry.</P>
<P>All this time I lived with my parents, and wrought on the plantation; and having had schooling pretty well for a planter, I used to improve it in winter-evenings, and other lei∣sure times; and being now in the twenty-first year of my age, a man, in much busi∣ness at shop-keeping and baking, asked me, if I would hire with him to tend shop and keep books. I acquainted my father with the proposal; and, after some deliberation, it was agreed for me to go.</P>
<P>At home I had lived retired; and now hav∣ing a prospect of being much in the way of company, I felt frequent and fervent cries in my heart to God, the Father of mercies, that he would preserve me from all taint and cor∣ruption; that, in this more public employ∣ment, I might serve Him, my gracious Re∣deemer, in that humility and self-denial, with which I had been, in a small degree, ex∣ercised in a more private life. The man, who employed me, furnished a shop in Mount-Holly, about five miles from my father's
<PB N="11" REF="013782_0025_0F91A778EFB57C58"/>
house, and six from his own; and there I lived alone, and tended his shop. Shortly af∣ter my settlement here, I was visited by seve∣ral young people my former acquaintance, who knew not but vanities would be as agree∣able to me now as ever; and, at these times, I cried to the Lord in secret for wisdom and strength; for I felt myself encompassed with difficulties, and had fresh occasion to bewail the follies of time past, in contracting a fa∣miliarity with libertine people: and as I had now left my father's house outwardly, I found my heavenly Father to be merciful to me be∣yond what I can express.</P>
<P>By day I was much amongst people, and had many trials to go through; but in the evenings, I was mostly alone, and may with thankfulness acknowledge, that, in those times, the spirit of supplication was often poured upon me; under which I was fre∣quently exercised, and felt my strength re∣newed.</P>
<P>In a few months after I came here, my master bought several Scotchmen servants, from on board a vessel, and brought them to Mount-Holly to sell; one of which was ta∣ken sick, and died.</P>
<P>In the latter part of his sickness, he, being delirious, used to curse and swear most sor∣rowfully; and the next night after his buri∣al, I was left to sleep alone in the same cham∣ber where he died: I perceived in me a timo∣rousness; I knew, however, I had not injured the man, but assisted in taking care of him
<PB N="12" REF="013782_0026_0F91A779ADD14368"/>
according to my capacity; and was not free to ask any one, on that occasion, to sleep with me: nature was feeble; but every tryal was a fresh incitement to give myself up wholly to the service of God, for I found no helper like him in times of trouble.</P>
<P>After a while, my former acquaintance gave over expecting me as one of their company; and I began to be known to some whose con∣versation was helpful to me: and now, as I had experienced the love of God, through Jesus Christ, to redeem me from many pol∣lutions, and to be a succour to me through a sea of conflicts, with which no person was fully acquainted; and as my heart was often enlarged in this heavenly principle, I felt a tender compassion for the youth, who re∣mained entangled in snares like those which had entangled me from one time to another: this love and tenderness increased; and my mind was more strongly engaged for the good of my fellow-creatures. I went to meetings in an awful frame of mind, and endeavoured to be inwardly acquainted with the language of the true Shepherd; and one day, being under a strong exercise of spirit, I stood up, and said some words in a meeting; but not keeping close to the divine opening, I said more than was required of me; and being soon sensible of my error, I was afflicted in mind some weeks, without any light or comfort, even to that degree that I could not take satisfac∣tion in any thing: I remembered God, and was troubled; and, in the depth of my dis∣tress,
<PB N="13" REF="013782_0027_0F91A77D1F11E738"/>
he had pity upon me, and sent the Comforter: I then felt forgiveness for my of∣fence, and my mind became calm and quiet, being truly thankful to my gracious Re∣deemer for his mercies; and after this, feel∣ing the spring of divine love opened, and a concern to speak, I said a few words in a meeting, in which I found peace; this, I believe, was about six weeks from the first time: and, as I was thus humbled and dis∣ciplined under the cross, my understanding became more strengthened to distinguish the pure spirit which inwardly moves upon the heart, and taught me to wait in silence some∣times many weeks together, until I felt that rise which prepares the creature to stand like a trumpet, through which the Lord speaks to his flock.</P>
<P>From an inward purifying, and stedfast abiding under it, springs a lively operative desire for the good of others: all the faith∣ful are not called to the public ministry; but whoever are, are called to minister of that which they have tasted and handled spiritu∣ally. The outward modes of worship are va∣rious; but wherever any are true ministers of Jesus Christ, it is from the operation of his spirit upon their hearts, first purifying them, and thus giving them a just sense of the conditions of others.</P>
<P>This truth was early fixed in my mind; and I was taught to watch the pure opening, and to take heed, lest, while I was standing to speak, my own will should get uppermost,
<PB N="14" REF="013782_0028_0F91A77E2A10DC20"/>
and cause me to utter words from worldly wisdom, and depart from the channel of the true gospel ministry. In the management of my outward affairs, I may say with thank∣fulness, I found truth to be my support; and I was respected in my master's family, who came to live in Mount-Holly within two years after my going there.</P>
<P>About the twenty-third year of my age, I had many fresh and heavenly openings, in respect to the care and providence of the Al∣mighty over his creatures in general, and over man as the most noble amongst those which are visible. And being clearly con∣vinced in my judgment, that to place my whole trust in God was best for me, I felt re∣newed engagements, that in all things I might act on an inward principle of virtue, and pursue worldly business no further, than as truth opened my way therein.</P>
<P>About the time called Christmas, I observ∣ed many people from the country, and dwell∣ers in town, who, resorting to publick-houses, spent their time in drinking and vain sports, tending to corrupt one another; on which account I was much troubled. At one house in particular there was much disorder; and I believed it was a duty incumbent on me to go and speak to the master of that house. I con∣sidered I was young, and that several elderly friends in town had opportunity to see these things; but though I would gladly have been excused, yet I could not feel my mind clear.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013782_0029_0F91A7801E0253C8"/>
The exercise was heavy: and as I was read∣ing what the Almighty said to Ezekiel, re∣specting his duty as a watchman, the matter was set home more clearly; and then, with prayers and tears, I besought the Lord for his assistance, who, in loving-kindness, gave me a resigned heart: then, at a suitable op∣portunity, I went to the publick-house; and seeing the man amongst much company, I went to him, and told him, I wanted to speak with him; so we went aside, and there, in the fear and dread of the Almighty, I exprest to him what rested on my mind; which he took kindly, and afterward shewed more re∣gard to me than before. In a few years af∣terwards he died, middle-aged; and I of∣ten thought, that had I neglected my duty in that case, it would have given me great trouble; and I was humbly thankful to my gracious Father, who had supported me here∣in.</P>
<P>My employer having a negro woman, sold her, and desired me to write a bill of sale, the man being waiting who bought her: the thing was sudden; and though the thoughts of writing an instrument of slavery for one of my fellow-creatures felt uneasy, yet I re∣membered I was hired by the year, that it was my master who directed me to do it, and that it was an elderly man, a member of our society, who bought her; so, through weak∣ness, I gave way, and wrote it; but, at the executing it, I was so afflicted in my mind, that I said, before my master and the friend,
<PB N="16" REF="013782_0030_0F91A7808AF851B0"/>
that I believed slave-keeping to be a practice inconsistent with the christian religion: this in some degree abated my uneasiness; yet, as often as I reflected seriously upon it, I thought I should have been clearer, if I had desired to be excused from it, as a thing against my con∣science; for such it was. And some time after this, a young man, of our society, spoke to me to write a conveyance of a slave to him; he having lately taken a negro into his house: I told him, I was not easy to write it; for, though many of our meeting and in other places kept slaves, I still believed the practice was not right; and desired to be excused from the writing. I spoke to him in good will; and he told me, that keeping slaves was not alto∣gether agreeable to his mind; but that the slave being a gift made to his wife, he had accept∣ed of her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>His first journey, on a religious visit, into East-Jersey, in company with Abraham Farring∣ton—His thoughts on merchandizing, and his learning a trade—His second journey, with Isaac Andrews, into Pennsylvania, Mary∣land, Virginia, and North-Carolina.—His third journey, with Peter Andrews, through part of West and East-Jersey—Some account of his sister Elizabeth, and her death—His fourth journey, with Peter Andrews, through New-York and Long-Island, to New-Eng∣land—And his fifth journey, with John Sykes, to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and the Lower Counties on Delaware.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY esteemed friend Abraham Farring∣ton, being about to make a visit to friends on the eastern side of this province, and having no companion, he proposed to me to go with him; and after a conference with some elderly friends, I agreed to go: so we set out the fifth day of the ninth month, in the year 1743; had an evening meeting at a tavern in Brunswick, a town in which none of our society dwelt; the room was full, and the people quiet. Thence to Amboy, and had an evening meeting in the court-house; to which came many people, amongst whom were several members of assembly, they be∣ing in town on the public affairs of the pro∣vince.
<PB N="18" REF="013782_0032_0F91A781EE396F60"/>
in both these meetings my antient companion was enlarged to preach, in the love of the gospel. Thence we went to Wood-bridge, Raway, and Plainfield; and had six or seven meetings in places where friends meetings are not usually held, being made up chiefly of presbyterians, and my beloved companion was frequently strength∣ened to publish the word of life amongst them: as for me, I was often silent thro' the meetings; and when I spake, it was with much care, that I might speak only what truth opened: my mind was often ten∣der, and I learned some profitable lessons. We were out about two weeks.</P>
<P>Near this time, being on some outward bu∣siness in which several families were concern∣ed, and which was attended with difficulties, some things relating thereto not being clearly stated, nor rightly understood by all, there arose some heat in the minds of the parties, and one valuable friend got off his watch; I had a great regard for him, and felt a strong inclination, after matters were settled, to speak to him concerning his conduct in that case; but I being a youth, and he far advanced in age and experience, my way appeared diffi∣cult; but after some days deliberation, and inward seeking to the Lord for assistance, I was made subject; so that I exprest what lay upon me, in a way which became my youth and his years: and though it was a hard task to me, it was well taken, and, I believe, was useful to us both.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="013782_0033_0F91A782C5F8EA58"/>
Having now been several years with my employer, and he doing less at merchandize than heretofore, I was thoughtful of some other way of business; perceiving merchan∣dize to be attended with much cumber, in the way of trading in these parts.</P>
<P>My mind, through the power of truth, was in a good degree weaned from the desire of outward greatness, and I was learning to be content with real conveniencies, that were not costly; so that a way of life, free from much entanglements, appeared best for me, tho' the income might be small. I had several offers of business that appeared profitable, but did not see my way clear to accept of them; as believing the business proposed would be attended with more outward care and cumber than was required of me to engage in.</P>
<P>I saw that a humble man, with the blessing of the Lord, might live on a little: and that where the heart was set on greatness, success in business did not satisfy the craving; but that commonly with an increase of wealth, the desire of wealth increased. There was a care on my mind so to pass my time, that nothing might hinder me from the most steady attention to the voice of the true Shep∣herd.</P>
<P>My employer, though now a retailer of goods, was by trad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a taylor, and kept a servant man at that business; and I began to think about learning the trade, expecting, that if I should settle, I might, by this trade, and a little retailing of goods, get a living
<PB N="20" REF="013782_0034_0F91A783C36E0188"/>
in a plain way, without the load of great business: I mentioned it to my employer, and we soon agreed on terms; and then, when I had leisure from the affairs of mer∣chandize, I worked with his man. I believed the hand of Providence pointed out this bu∣siness for me; and was taught to be content with it, though I felt, at times, a disposition that would have sought for something great∣er: but, through the revelation of Jesus Christ, I had seen the happiness of humility, and there was an earnest desire in me to en∣ter deep into it; and, at times, this desire arose to a degree of fervent supplication, wherein my soul was so environed with hea∣venly light and consolation, that things were made easy to me which had been otherwise.</P>
<P>After some time, my employer's wife died; she was a virtuous woman, and generally be∣loved of her neighbours: and soon after this, he left shopkeeping; and we parted. I then wrought at my trade, as a taylor; carefully attended meetings for worship and discipline; and found an enlargement of gospel love in my mind, and therein a concern to visit friends in some of the back settlements of Pennsylvania and Virginia; and being thoughtful about a companion, I expressed it to my beloved friend Isaac Andrews, who then told me that he had drawings to the same places; and also to go through Mary∣land, Virginia, and Carolina. After consi∣derable time past, and several conferences with him, I felt easy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o accompany him
<PB N="21" REF="013782_0035_0F91A785B0C3E300"/>
throughout, if way opened for it. I opened the case in our monthly meeting, and friends expressing their unity therewith, we obtained certificates to travel as companions; his from Haddonfield, and mine from Burlington.</P>
<P>We left our province on the twelfth day of the third month, in the year 1746, and had several meetings in the upper part of Chester county, and near Lancaster; in some of which, the love of Christ prevailed, uni∣ting us together in his service. Then we crossed the river Susquehannah, and had se∣veral meetings in a new settlement, called the Red-Lands; the oldest of which, as I was informed, did not exceed ten years. It is the poorer sort of people that commonly begin to improve remote deserts: with a small stock they have houses to build, lands to clear and fence, corn to raise, cloaths to provide, and children to educate; that friends, who visit such, may well sympathize with them in their hardships in the wilderness; and though the best entertainment such can give, may seem coarse to some who are used to cities, or old settled places, it becomes the disciples of Christ to be content with it. Our hearts were sometimes enlarged in the love of our heavenly Father amongst these people; and the sweet influence of his spirit sup∣ported us through some difficulties: to him be the praise.</P>
<P>We passed on to Manoquacy, Fairfax, Hopewell, and Shanando, and had meet∣ings; some of which were comfortable and
<PB N="22" REF="013782_0036_0F91A78672CE5518"/>
edifying. From Shanando we set off in the afternoon for the old settlements of friends in Virginia; and the first night, we, with our pilot, lodged in the woods, our horses feed∣ing near us; but he being poorly provided with a horse, and we young and having good horses, were free the next day to part with him; and did so. In two days after, we reached to our friend John Cheagle's, in Vir∣ginia: so we took the meetings in our way through Virginia; were, in some degree, baptized into a feeling sense of the condi∣tions of the people; and our exercise in ge∣neral was more painful in these old settle∣ments, than it had been amongst the back inhabitants: but through the goodness of our heavenly Father, the well of living-wa∣ters was, at times, opened to our encou∣ragement, and the refreshment of the sincere hearted. We went on to Perquimons, in North-Carolina; had several meetings, which were large; and found some openness in those parts, and a hopeful appearance amongst the young people. So we turned again to Virginia, and attended most of the meetings which we had not been at before, labouring amongst friends in the love of Jesus Christ, as ability was given: and thence went to the mountains, up James River, to a new settle∣ment; and had several meetings amongst the people, some of whom had lately joined in membership with our society.</P>
<P>In our journeying to and fro, we found some honest-hearted friends, who appeared
<PB N="23" REF="013782_0037_0F91A78A12A554A8"/>
to be concerned for the cause of truth among a backsliding people.</P>
<P>From Virginia, we crossed over the river Patowmac, at Hoe's ferry, and made a gene∣ral visit to the meetings of friends on the Western Shore of Maryland; and were at their quarterly meeting. We had some hard labour amongst them, endeavouring to dis∣charge our duty honestly as way opened, in the love of truth: and thence taking sundry meetings in our way, we passed homeward; where, through the favour of Divine Provi∣dence, we reached the sixteenth day of the sixth month, in the year 1746; and I may say, that through the assistance of the Holy Spirit, which mortifies selfish desires, my companion and I travelled in harmony, and parted in the nearness of true brotherly love.</P>
<P>Two things were remarkable to me in this journey: first, in regard to my entertain∣ment; when I eat, drank, and lodged free-cost with people, who lived in ease on the hard labour of their slaves, I felt uneasy; and as my mind was inward to the Lord, I found, from place to place, this uneasiness return upon me, at times, through the whole visit. Where the masters bore a good share of the burthen, and lived frugally, so that their servants were well provided for, and their labour moderate, I felt more easy; but where they lived in a costly way, and laid heavy burthens on their slaves, my exercise was often great, and I frequently had con∣versation with them, in private, concerning
<PB N="24" REF="013782_0038_0F91A78A34846D70"/>
it. Secondly: this trade of importing slaves from their native country being much en∣couraged amongst them, and the white peo∣ple and their children so generally living without much labour, was frequently the subject of my serious thoughts: and I saw in these southern provinces so many vices and corruptions, increased by this trade and this way of life, that it appeared to me as a dark gloominess hanging over the land; and though now many willingly run into it, yet in future the consequence will be grievous to posterity: I express it as it hath appeared to me, not at once, nor twice, but as a matter fixed on my mind.</P>
<P>Soon after my return home, I felt an in∣creasing concern for friends on our sea coast; and on the eighth day of the eighth month, in the year 1746, with the unity of friends, and in company with my beloved friend and neighbour Peter Andrews, brother to my companion before-mentioned, we set for∣ward, and visited meetings generally about Salem, Cape May, Great and Little Egg-Harbour; and had meetings at Barnagat, Mannahockin, and Mane-Squan, and so to the yearly meeting at Shrewsbury. Through the goodness of the Lord way was opened, and the strength of divine love was sometimes felt in our assemblies, to the comfort and help of those who were rightly concerned be∣fore him. We were out twenty-two days, and rode, by computation, three hundred and forty miles. At Shrewsbury yearly meet∣ing,
<PB N="25" REF="013782_0039_0F91A78B52B5B028"/>
we met with our dear friends Michael Lightfoot and Abraham Farrington, who had good service there.</P>
<P>The winter following died my eldest sister, Elizabeth Woolman, jun. of the small-pox, aged thirty-one years. She was, from her youth, of a thoughtful disposition; and very compassionate to her acquaintance in their sickness or distress, being ready to help as far as she could. She was dutiful to her parents; one instance whereof follows:—It happened that she, and two of her sisters, be∣ing then near the estate of young women, had an inclination one first day after meet∣ing to go on a visit to some other young women at some distance off; whose compa∣ny, I believe, would have done them no good. They exprest their desire to our pa∣rents; who were dissatisfied with the propo∣sal, and stopped them. The same day, as my sisters and I were together, and they talking about their disappointment, Eliza∣beth exprest her contentment under it; sig∣nifying, she believed it might be for their good.</P>
<P>A few years after she attained to mature-age, through the gracious visitations of God's love, she was strengthened to live a self-deny∣ing exemplary life, giving herself much to reading and meditation.</P>
<P>The following letter may shew, in some degree, her disposition:</P>

<P>The fore part of her illness she was in great sadness and dejection of mind, of which she told one of her intimate friends, and said, when I was a young girl I was wanton and airy, but I thought I had tho∣roughly repented for it; and added, I have of late had great satisfaction in meetings. Though she was thus disconsolate, still she retained a hope, which was as an anchor to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: and some time after, the same friend
<PB N="27" REF="013782_0041_0F91A78C6EDD6BD8"/>
came again to see her, to whom she men∣tioned her former expressions, and said, it is otherwise now, for the Lord hath rewarded me seven-fold; and I am unable to express the greatness of his love manifested to me. Her disorder appearing dangerous, and our mother being sorrowful, she took notice of it, and said, dear mother, weep not for me; I go to my God: and many times, with an audible voice, uttered praise to her Re∣deemer.</P>
<P>A friend coming some miles to see her the morning before she died, asked her, how she did? she answered, I have had a hard night, but shall not have another such, for I shall die, and it will be well with my soul; and accordingly died the next evening.</P>

Of late I found drawings in my mind to visit friends in New-England, and having an opportunity of joining in company with my beloved friend Peter Andrews; we, hav∣ing obtained certificates from our monthly meeting, set forward on the sixteenth day of the third month, in the year 1747, and reached the yearly meeting at Long-Island; at which were our friends Samuel Notting∣ham from England, John Griffith, Jane Hoskins, and Elizabeth Hudson from Penn∣sylvania, and Jacob Andrews from Chester∣field. Several of whom were favoured in their publick exercise; and, through the goodness of the Lord, we had some edifying meetings. After this, my companion and I visited friends on Long-Island; and, through the mercies of God, we were helped in the work.</P>
<P>Besides going to the settled meetings of friends, we were at a general meeting at Se∣tawket, chiefly made up of other societies: and had a meeting at Oyster-Bay, in a dwelling-house, at which were many people: at the first of which there was not much said by way of testimony; but was, I believe, a good meeting: at the latter, through the springing up of living-waters, it was a day to be thankfully remembered. Having visited the island, we went over to the main, taking meetings in our way, to Oblong, Nine-Part∣ners and New-Milford.—In these back settle∣ments we met with several people, who, through the immediate workings of the spi∣rit
<PB N="29" REF="013782_0043_0F91A78E014D6B78"/>
of Christ on their minds, were drawn from the vanities of the world, to an inward ac∣quaintance with him: they were educated in the way of the presbyterians. A considerable number of the youth, members of that society, were used to spend their time often together in merriment, but some of the principal young men of that company being visited by the powerful workings of the spirit of Christ, and thereby led humbly to take up his cross, could no longer join in those vanities; and as these stood stedfast to that inward con∣vincement, they were made a blessing to some of their former companions; so that, through the power of truth, several were brought into a close exercise concerning the eternal well-being of their souls. These young people continued for a time to frequent their pub∣lick worship; and besides that, had meetings of their own; which meetings were a while allowed by their preacher, who sometimes met with them: but, in time, their judg∣ment in matters of religion disagreeing with some of the articles of the presbyterians, their meetings were disapproved by that so∣ciety; and such of them who stood firm to their duty, as it was inwardly manifested, had many difficulties to go through: and their meetings were in a while dropped; some of them returning to the presbyterians, and others of them, after a time, joined to our religious society.</P>
<P>I had conversation with some of the latter, to my help and edification; and believe seve∣ral

of them are acquainted with the nature of that worship, which is performed in spirit and in truth. From hence, accompanied by Amos Powel, a friend from Long-Island, we rode through Connecticut, chiefly inha∣bited by presbyterians; who were generally civil to us, so far as I saw: and after three days riding, we came amongst friends in the colony of Rhode-Island. We visited friends in and about Newport, and Dartmouth, and generally in those parts; and then to Boston; and proceeded eastward as far as Dover: and then returned to Newport, and not far from thence, we met our friend Thomas Gaw∣throp from England; who was then on a vi∣sit to these provinces. From Newport we sailed to Nantucket; were there near a week; and from thence came over to Dartmouth: and having finished our visit in these parts, we crossed the Sound from New-London to Long-Island; and taking some meetings on the island, proceeded homeward; where we reached the thirteenth day of the seventh month, in the year 1747, having rode about fifteen hundred miles, and sailed about one hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>In this journey, I may say in general, we were sometimes in much weakness, and la∣boured under discouragements; and at other times, through the renewed manifestations of divine love, we had seasons of refreshment, wherein the power of truth prevailed.</P>
<P>We were taught, by renewed experience, to labour for an inward stillness; at no time
<PB N="31" REF="013782_0045_0F91A7921D945F58"/>
to seek for words, but to live in the spirit of truth, and utter that to the people which truth opened in us. My beloved companion and I belonged both to one meeting, came forth in the ministry near the same time, and were inwardly united in the work: he was about thirteen years older than I, bore the heaviest burthen, and was an instrument of the greatest use.</P>
<P>Finding a concern to visit friends in the Lower Counties on Delaware, and on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and having an opportunity to join with my well-beloved antient friend John Sykes, we obtained cer∣tificates, and set off the seventh day of the eighth month, in the year 1748, were at the meetings of friends in the lower counties, attended the yearly meeting at Little Creek, and made a visit to chief of the meetings on the Eastern Shore; and so home by the way of Nottingham: were abroad about six weeks; and rode, by computation, about five hun∣dred and fifty miles.</P>
<P>Our exercise, at times, was heavy; but, through the goodness of the Lord, we were of∣ten refreshed: and I may say, by experience, "He is a strong hold in the day of trouble." Though our society, in these parts, appeared to me to be in a declining condition; yet, I believe, the Lord hath a people amongst them, who labout to serve him uprightly, but have many difficulties to encounter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>His marriage—The death of his father—His journies into the upper part of New-Jersey, and afterwards into Pennsylvania—Conside∣rations on keeping slaves, and his visits to the families of friends at several times and places—An epistle from the general meeting—His journey to Long-Island—Considerations on trading, and on the use of spirituous liquors and costly apparel—And his letter to a friend.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT this time believing it good for me to settle, and thinking seriously a∣bout a companion, my heart was turned to the Lord with desires that he would give me wisdom to proceed therein agreeable to his will; and He was pleased to give me a well-inclined damsel, Sarah Ellis; to whom I was married the eighteenth day of the eighth month, in the year 1749.</P>
<P>In the fall of the year 1750 died my fa∣ther, Samuel Woolman, with a fever, aged about sixty years.</P>
<P>In his life-time he manifested much care for us his children, that in our youth we might learn to fear the Lord; often endea∣vouring to imprint in our minds the true principles of virtue, and particularly to che∣rish in us a spirit of tenderness, not only to∣wards
<PB N="33" REF="013782_0047_0F91A7932E0A83A8"/>
poor people, but also towards all crea∣tures of which we had the command.</P>
<P>After my return from Carolina in the year 1746, I made some observations on keeping slaves, which some time before his decease I shewed him; and he perused the manuscript, proposed a few alterations, and appeared well satisfied that I found a concern on that ac∣count: and in his last sickness, as I was watching with him one night, he being so far spent that there was no expectation of his recovery, but had the perfect use of his un∣derstanding, he asked me concerning the ma∣nuscript, whether I expected soon to proceed to take the advice of friends in publishing it? and, after some conversation thereon, said, I have all along been deeply affected with the oppression of the poor negroes; and now, at last, my concern for them is as great as ever.</P>
<P>By his direction, I had wrote his will in a time of health, and that night he desired me to read it to him, which I did; and he said, it was agreeable to his mind. He then made mention of his end, which he believed was now near; and signified, that though he was sensible of many imperfections in the course of his life, yet his experience of the power of truth, and of the love and goodness of God from time to time, even till now, was such, that he had no doubt but that in leav∣ing this life he should enter into one more happy.</P>
<P>The next day his sister Elizabeth came to see him, and told him of the decease of their
<PB N="34" REF="013782_0048_0F91A793FB8F4C98"/>
sister Ann; who died a few days before: he then said, I reckon sister Ann was free to leave this world? Elizabeth said, she was: he then said, I also am free to leave it; and being in great weakness of body said, I hope I shall shortly go to rest. He continued in a weighty frame of mind, and was sensible till near the last.</P>
<P>On the second day of the ninth month, in the year 1751, feeling drawings in my mind to visit friends at the Great Meadows, in the upper part of West-Jersey, with the unity of our monthly-meeting, I went there; and had some searching laborious exercise amongst friends in those parts, and found inward peace therein.</P>
<P>In the ninth month of the year 1753, in company with my well-esteemed friend John Sykes, and with the unity of friends, we travelled about two weeks, visiting friends in Bucks-County. We laboured in the love of the gospel, according to the measure re∣ceived; and, through the mercies of Him, who is strength to the poor who trust in him, we found satisfaction in our visit: and in the next winter, way opening to visit friends fa∣milies within the compass of our monthly-meeting, partly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the labours of two friends from Pennsylvania, I joined in some part of the work; having had a desire some time that it might go forward amongst us.</P>
<P>About this time, a person at some distance lying sick, his brother came to me to write his will: I knew he had slaves; and asking
<PB N="35" REF="013782_0049_0F91A794B64AE530"/>
his brother, was told he intended to leave them as slaves to his children. As writing is a profitable employ, and as offending sober people was disagreeble to my inclination, I was straitened in my mind; but as I looked to the Lord, he inclined my heart to his tes∣timony: and I told the man, that I believed the practice of continuing slavery to this people was not right; and had a scruple in my mind against doing writings of that kind: that though many in our society kept them as slaves, still I was not easy to be con∣cerned in it; and desired to be excused from going to write the will. I spake to him in the fear of the Lord; and he made no reply to what I said, but went away: he also had some concerns in the practice; and I thought he was displeased with me. In this case I had a fresh confirmation, that acting con∣trary to present outward interest, from a mo∣tive of divine love, and in regard to truth and righteousness, and thereby incurring the resentments of people, opens the way to a treasure better than silver, and to a friend∣ship exceeding the friendship of men.</P>
<P>The manuscript before-mentioned having laid by me several years, the publication of it rested weightily upon me; and this year I offered it to the revisal of friends, who, hav∣ing examined and made some small altera∣tions in it, directed a number of copies there∣of to be published and dispersed amongst friends.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="013782_0050_0F91A7956D461A68"/>
In the year 1754, I found my mind drawn to join in a visit to friends families belonging to Chesterfield monthly-meeting; and hav∣ing the approbation of our own, I went to their monthly-meeting in order to confer with friends, and see if way opened for it: I had conference with some of their mem∣bers, the proposal having been opened before in their meeting, and one friend agreed to join with me as a companion for a begin∣ning; but when meeting was ended, I felt great distress of mind, and doubted what way to take, or whether to go home and wait for greater clearness: I kept my distress se∣cret; and going with a friend to his house, my desires were to the great Shepherd for his heavenly instruction; and in the morning I felt easy to proceed on the visit, being very low in my mind: and as mine eye was turn∣ed to the Lord, waiting in families in deep reverence before him, he was pleased graci∣ously to afford help; so that we had many comfortable opportunities, and it appeared as a fresh visitation to some young people. I spent several weeks this winter in the service; part of which time was employed near home. And again in the following winter I was se∣veral weeks in the same service; some part of the time at Shrewsbury, in company with my beloved friend John Sykes; and have cause humbly to acknowledge, that thro' the good∣ness of the Lord, our hearts were, at times, enlarged in his love; and strength was given
<PB N="37" REF="013782_0051_0F91A79928ECAF40"/>
to go through the trials which, in the course of our visit, attended us.</P>
<P>From a disagreement between the powers of England and France, it was now a time of trouble on this Continent; and an epistle to friends went forth from our general spring meeting, which I thought good to give a place in this journal.</P>
<P>An EPISTLE from our general spring meet∣ing of ministers and elders for Pennsylva∣nia and New-Jersey, held at Philadelphia, from the twenty-ninth of the third month, to the first of the fourth month, inclusive, 1755.</P>
<P>To friends on the continent of America.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN an humble sense of divine goodness, and the gracious continuation of God's love to his people, we tenderly salute you; and are at this time therein engaged in mind, that all of us who profess the truth, as held forth and published by our worthy predecessors in this latter age of the world, may keep near to that life which is the light of men, and be strengthened to hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, that our trust may not be in man, but in the Lord alone, who ruleth in the army of heaven, and in the kingdoms of men, before whom the earth is as the dust of the ballance, and her inha∣bitants as grasshoppers. Isa.xl. 22.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="013782_0052_0F91A79B1CD0BD50"/>
We (being convinced that the gracious de∣sign of the Almighty in sending his Son in∣to the world, was to repair the breach made by disobedience, to finish sin and transgres∣sion, that his kingdom might come, and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven) have found it to be our duty to cease from those national contests productive of misery and bloodshed, and submit our cause to Him the Most High, whose tender love to his chil∣dren exceeds the most warm affections of na∣tural parents, and who hath promised to his seed throughout the earth, as to one indivi∣dual, <Q>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</Q> Heb. xiii. 5. And as we, through the gracious dealings of the Lord our God, have had experience of that work which is carried on, <Q>not by <HI>earthly</HI> might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts:</Q> Zech. iv. 6. By which opera∣tion, that spiritual kingdom is set up, which is to subdue and break in pieces all king∣doms that oppose it, and shall stand for ever. In a deep sense thereof, and of the safety, stability and peace there is in it, we are de∣sirous that all who profess the truth, may be inwardly acquainted with it, and thereby be qualified to conduct in all parts of our life as becomes our peaceable profession: And we trust, as there is a faithful continuance to depend wholly upon the almighty arm, from one generation to another, the peacea∣ble kingdom will gradually be extended <Q>from sea to sea, and from the river to the
<PB N="39" REF="013782_0053_0F91A79C2E6B6858"/>
ends of the earth,</Q> Zech. ix. 10. to the completion of those prophesies already be∣gun, that <Q>nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, nor learn war any more.</Q> Isa. ii. 4. Micah iv. 3.</P>
<P>And, dearly beloved friends, seeing we have these promises, and believe that God is begin∣ning to fulfil them, let us constantly endeavour to have our minds sufficiently disentangled from the surfeiting cares of this life, and re∣deemed from the love of the world, that no earthly possessions nor enjoyments may bias our judgments, or turn us from that resigna∣tion, and entire trust in God, to which his blessing is most surely annexed; then may we say, <Q>Our Redeemer is mighty, he will plead our cause for us.</Q> Jer. 1. 34. And if, for the further promoting his most gracious purposes in the earth, he should give us to taste of that bitter cup which his faithful ones have often partook of; O that we may be rightly prepared to receive it!</P>
<P>And now, dear friends, with respect to the commotions and stirrings of the powers of the earth at this time near us, we are desi∣rous that none of us may be moved thereat; <Q>But repose ourselves in the munition of that rock that all these shakings shall not move, even in the knowledge and feeling of the eternal power of God, keeping us subjectly given up to his heavenly will, and feel it daily to mortify that which remains in any of us which is of this world: for
<PB N="40" REF="013782_0054_0F91A79CEEE971F8"/>
the worldly part in any, is the changeable part, and that is up and down, full and empty, joyful and sorrowful, as things go well or ill in this world; for as the truth is but one, and many are made partakers of its spirit, so the world is but one, and many are made partakers of the spirit of it; and so many as do partake of it, so many will be straitened and perplexed with it: but they who are single to the truth, waiting daily to feel the life and virtue of it in their hearts, these shall rejoice in the midst of adversity,</Q> and have to experience with the prophet, That <Q>Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; yet will <HI>they</HI> rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of <HI>their</HI> salvation.</Q> Hab. iii. 17, 18.</P>
<P>If, contrary to this, we profess the truth, and not living under the power and influ∣ence of it, are producing fruits disagreeable to the purity thereof, and trust to the strength of man to support ourselves, therein our con∣fidence will be vain. For He, who removed the hedge from his vineyard, and gave it to be trodden under foot, by reason of the wild grapes it produced, (Isa. v. 5.) remains un∣changeable: and if, for the chastisement of wickedness, and the further promoting his
<PB N="41" REF="013782_0055_0F91A79DB8501B70"/>
own glory, he doth arise, even, to shake ter∣ribly the earth, who then may oppose him, and prosper!</P>
<P>We remain, in the love of the gospel, your friends and brethren.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Scrupling to do writings relative to keep∣ing slaves, having been a means of sundry small trials to me, in which I have so evi∣dently felt my own will set aside, that I think it good to mention a few of them—Trades∣men and retailers of goods, who depend on their business for a living, are naturally in∣clined to keep the good-will of their custom∣ers; nor is it a pleasant thing for young men to be under any necessity to question the judgment or honesty of elderly men, and more especially of such who have a fair re∣putation. Deep-rooted customs, tho' wrong, are not easily altered; but it is the duty of every one to be firm in that which they cer∣tainly know is right for them. A charitable benevolent man, well acquainted with a ne∣gro, may, I believe, under some circum∣stances, keep him in his family as a servant, on no other motives than the negroe's good; but man, as man knows not what shall be af∣ter him, nor hath he any assurance that his children will attain to that perfection in wis∣dom and goodness necessary rightly to exer∣cise such power: hence it is clear to me, that I ought not to be the scribe where wills are
<PB N="42" REF="013782_0056_0F91A79E75A86788"/>
drawn, in which some children are made ab∣solute masters over others during life.</P>
<P>About this time, an antient man of good esteem in the neighbourhood, came to my house to get his will wrote; he had young negroes; and I asked him privately, how he purposed to dispose of them? he told me: I then said, I cannot write thy will without breaking my own peace; and respectfully gave him my reasons for it: he signified that he had a choice that I should have wrote it; but as I could not, consistent with my con∣science, he did not desire it: and so he got it wrote by some other person. And a few years after, there being great alterations in his family, he came again to get me to write his will: his negroes were yet young; and his son, to whom he intended to give them, was, since he first spoke to me, from a liber∣tine, become a sober young man; and he supposed, that I would have been free, on that account, to write it. We had much friendly talk on the subject, and then de∣ferred it: and a few days after, he came again, and directed their freedom; and so I wrote his will.</P>
<P>Near the time the last mentioned friend first spoke to me, a neighbour received a bad bruise in his body, and sent for me to bleed him; which being done, he desired me to write his will: I took notes; and, amongst other things, he told me to which of his children he gave his young negro: I consi∣dered the pain and distress he was in, and
<PB N="43" REF="013782_0057_0F91A79F790221A8"/>
knew not how it would end; so I wrote his will, save only that part concerning his slave, and carrying it to his bed-side, read it to him; and then told him in a friendly way, that I could not write any instruments by which my fellow-creatures were made slaves, without bringing trouble on my own mind: I let him know that I charged nothing for what I had done; and desired to be excused from doing the other part in the way he proposed: we then had a serious conference on the subject; at length, he agreeing to set her free, I finished his will.</P>
<P>Having found drawings in my mind to visit friends on Long-Island, after obtaining a certificate from our monthly-meeting, I set off on the twelfth day of the fifth month, in the year 1756. When I reached the island, I lodged the first night at the house of my dear friend Richard Halle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: the next day, be∣ing the first of the week, I was at the meet∣ing in Newtown; in which we experienced the renewed manifestations of the love of Je∣sus Christ, to the comfort of the honest-hearted. I went that night to Flushing; and the next day, in company with my be∣loved friend Matthew Franklin, we crossed the ferry at White-Stone; were at three meet∣ings on the main, and then returned to the island; where I spent the remainder of the week in visiting meetings. The Lord, I be∣lieve, hath a people in those parts, who are honestly inclined to serve him; but many, I fear, are too much clogged with the things of this life, and do not come forward bear∣ing
<PB N="44" REF="013782_0058_0F91A7A3189BF510"/>
the cross in such faithfulness as he calls for.</P>
<P>My mind was deeply engaged in this visit, both in public and private; and, at several places where I was, on observing that they had slaves, I found myself under a necessity, in a friendly way, to labour with them on that subject; expressing, as way opened, the inconsistency of that practice with the purity of the christian religion, and the ill effects of it manifested amongst us.</P>
<P>The latter end of the week, their yearly-meeting began; at which were our friends John Scarbrough, Jane Hoskins, and Susan∣nah Brown, from Pennsylvania: the publick meetings were large, and measurably favour∣ed with divine goodness.</P>
<P>The exercise of my mind, at this meeting, was chiefly on account of those who were considered as the foremost rank in the soci∣ety: and in a meeting of ministers and el∣ders, way opened, that I expressed in some measure what lay upon me; and at a time when friends were met for transacting the affairs of the church, having set a while si∣lent, I felt a weight on my mind, and stood up; and, through the gracious regard of our heavenly Father, strength was given fully to clear myself of a burthen, which for some days had been increasing upon me.</P>
<P>Through the humbling dispensations of Divine Providence, men are sometimes fitted for his service. The messages of the prophet Jeremiah were so disagreeable to the people,
<PB N="45" REF="013782_0059_0F91A7A6CF75F648"/>
and so reverse to the spirit they lived in, that he became the object of their reproach; and in the weakness of nature, thought of desist∣ing from his prophetick office; but, saith he, <Q>His word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones; and I was weary with forbearing, and could not stay.</Q> I saw at this time, that if I was honest in de∣claring that which truth opened in me, I could not please all men; and laboured to be content in the way of my duty, however disagreeable to my own inclination. After this I went homeward, taking Woodbridge and Plainfield in my way; in both which meetings, the pure influence of divine love was manifested; in an humbling sense where∣of I went home: having been out about twenty-four days, and rode about three hundred and sixteen miles.</P>
<P>While I was out on this journey, my heart was much affected with a sense of the state of the churches in our southern provinces; and believing the Lord was calling me to some further labour amongst them, I was bowed in reverence before him, with fervent desires that I might find strength to resign myself up to his heavenly will.</P>
<P>Until this year, 1756, I continued to re∣tail goods, besides following my trade as a taylor; about which time, I grew uneasy on account of my business growing too cum∣bersome. I had began with selling trim∣mings for garments, and from thence pro∣ceeded to sell cloths and linens; and, at
<PB N="46" REF="013782_0060_0F91A7A7D4F8FCF0"/>
length, having got a considerable shop of goods, my trade increased every year, and the road to large business appeared open; but I felt a stop in my mind.</P>
<P>Through the mercies of the Almighty, I had, in a good degree, learned to be content with a plain way of living: I had but a small family; and on serious consideration, I believed truth did not require me to engage in much cumbering affairs: it had been my general practice to buy and sell things really useful: things that served chiefly to please the vain mind in people, I was not easy to trade in; seldom did it; and whenever I did, I found it weaken me as a christian.</P>
<P>The increase of business became my bur∣then; for though my natural inclination was toward merchandize, yet I believed truth re∣quired me to live more free from outward cumbers: and there was now a strife in my mind between the two; and in this exercise my prayers were put up to the Lord, who graciously heard me, and gave me a heart re∣signed to his holy will: then I lessened my outward business; and, as I had opportuni∣ty, told my customers of my intentions, that they might consider what shop to turn to: and, in a while, wholly laid down merchan∣dize, following my trade as a taylor; myself only, having no apprentice. I also had a nursery of apple-trees; in which I employed some of my time in hoeing, grafting, trim∣ming, and inoculating. In merchandise it is the custom, where I lived, to sell chiefly
<PB N="47" REF="013782_0061_0F91A7A9C39B33D8"/>
on credit, and poor people often get in debt; and when payment is expected, not having wherewith to pay, their creditors often sue for it at law. Having often observed occur∣rences of this kind, I found it good for me to advise poor people to take such goods as were most useful and not costly.</P>
<P>In the time of trading, I had an opportu∣nity of seeing, that the too liberal use of spi∣rituous liquors, and the custom of wearing too costly apparel, led some people into great inconveniencies; and these two things appear to be often connected one with the other; for by not attending to that use of things which is consistent with universal righteousness, there is an increase of labour which extends beyond what our heavenly Father intends for us: and by great labour, and often by much sweating, there is, even among such who are not drunkards, a craving of some liquors to revive the spirits: that partly by the luxuri∣ous drinking of some, and partly by the drinking of others, (led to it through immo∣derate labour) very great quantities of rum are every year expended in our colonies; the greater part of which we should have no need of, did we steadily attend to pure wisdom.</P>
<P>Where men take pleasure in feeling their minds elevated with strong drink, and so in∣dulge their appetite as to disorder their un∣derstandings, neglect their duty as members in a family or civil society, and cast off all regard to religion, their case is much to be pitied; and where such whose lives are for
<PB N="48" REF="013782_0062_0F91A7AA71345BF8"/>
the most past regular, and whose examples have a strong influence on the minds of others, adhere to some customs which power∣fully draw to the use of more strong liquor than pure wisdom allows; this also, as it hinders the spreading of the spirit of meek∣ness, and strengthens the hands of the more excessive drinkers, is a case to be lamented.</P>
<P>As every degree of luxury hath some con∣nexion with evil; for those who profess to be disciples of Christ, and are looked upon as leaders of the people, to have that mind in them, which was also in Christ, and so stand separate from every wrong way, is a means of help to the weaker. As I have sometimes been much spent in the heat, and taken spi∣rits to revive me, I have found by experi∣ence, that in such circumstances the mind is not so calm, nor so fitly disposed for divine meditation, as when all such extremes are avoided; and I have felt an increasing care to attend to that holy Spirit which sets right bounds to our desires; and leads those who faithfully follow it, to apply all the gifts of Divine Providence to the purposes for which they were intended. Did such who have the care of great estates, attend with singleness of heart to this heavenly Instructor, which so opens and enlarges the mind, that men love their neighbours as themselves, they would have wisdom given them to manage, without finding occasion to employ some peo∣ple in the luxuries of life, or to make it ne∣cessary for others to labour too hard; but for
<PB N="49" REF="013782_0063_0F91A7AB30491580"/>
want of steadily regarding this principle of divine love, a selfish spirit takes place in the minds of people, which is attended with darkness and manifold confusions in the world.</P>
<P>Though trading in things useful is an ho∣nest employ; yet, through the great number of superfluities which are bought and sold, and through the corruption of the times, they who apply to merchandize for a living, have great need to be well experienced in that precept which the prophet Jeremiah laid down for his scribe: <Q>Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not.</Q></P>
<P>In the winter, this year, I was engaged with friends in visiting families; and, thro' the goodness of the Lord, we had oftentimes experience of his heart-tendering presence amongst us.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A copy of a letter wrote to a friend.</HEAD>
<P>IN this thy late affliction I have found a deep fellow-feeling with thee; and had a secret hope throughout, that it might please the Father of mercies to raise thee up, and sanctify thy troubles to thee; that thou be∣ing more fully acquainted with that way which the world esteems foolish, may feel the cloathing of divine fortitude, and be strength∣ened to resist that spirit which leads from the simplicity of the everlasting truth.</P>

We may see ourselves crippled and halt∣ing, and from a strong bias to things plea∣sant and easy, find an impossibility to advance forward; but things impossible with men are possible with God; and our wills being made subject to his, all temptations are surmount∣able.</P>
<P>This work of subjecting the will, is com∣pared to the mineral in the furnace; which, thro' fervent heat, is reduced from its first principle: <Q>He refines them as silver is refined—He shall sit as a refiner, and pu∣rifier of silver.</Q> By these comparisons, we are instructed in the necessity of the melt∣ing operation of the hand of God upon us, to prepare our hearts truly to adore him, and manifest that adoration, by inwardly turn∣ing away from that spirit in all its workings, which is not of him. To forward this work, the all-wise God is sometimes pleased, thro' outward distress, to bring us near the gates of death; that life being painful and afflict∣ing, and the prospect of eternity open before us, all earthly bonds may be loosened, and the mind prepared for that deep and sacred instruction, which otherwise would not be received. If kind parents love their children and delight in their happiness, then He, who is perfect goodness in sending abroad mortal contagions, doth assuredly direct their use—Are the righteous removed by it, their change is happy; are the wicked taken away in their wickedness, the Almighty is clear: Do we
<PB N="51" REF="013782_0065_0F91A7AD70A2E1C8"/>
pass through with anguish and great bitter∣ness, and yet recover, He intends that we should be purged from dross, and our ear opened to discipline.</P>
<P>And now on thy part, after thy sore af∣fliction and doubts of recovery, thou art again restored, forget not Him who hath helped thee; but in humble gratitude hold fast his instructions, thereby to shun those bye paths which lead from the firm founda∣tion. I am sensible of that variety of com∣pany, to which one in thy business must be exposed: I have painfully felt the force of conversation proceeding from men deeply rooted in an earthly mind, and can sympa∣thize with others in such conflicts, in that much weakness still attends me.</P>
<P>I find that to be a fool as to worldly wis∣dom, and commit my cause to God, not fear∣ing to offend men, who take offence at the simplicity of truth, is the only way to re∣main unmoved at the sentiments of others.</P>
<P>The fear of man brings a snare; by halt∣ing in our duty, and giving back in the time of trial, our hands grow weaker, our spirits get mingled with the people, our ears grow dull as to hearing the language of the true Shepherd; that when we look at the way of the righteous, it seems as though it was not for us to follow them.</P>
<P>There is a love clothes my mind while I write, which is superior to all expressions; and I find my heart open to encourage to a holy emulation, to advance forward in christ∣tian

firmness. Deep humility is a strong bul∣wark; and as we enter into it, we find safe∣ty and true exaltation: the foolishness of God is wiser than man, and the weakness of God is stronger than man. Being uncloathed of our own wisdom, and knowing the abase∣ment of the creature, therein we find that power to arise, which gives health and vigor to us.</P>

<P>His visiting the families of friends at Burling∣ton—His journey to Pennsylvania, Mary∣land, Virginia, and North-Carolina—Consi∣derations on the state of friends there; and the exercise he was under in travelling among those so generally concerned in keeping slaves: with some observations in conversation, at se∣veral times, on this subject—His epistle to friends at New-Garden and Cane-Creek—His thoughts on the neglect of a religious care in the education of the negroes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE thirteenth day of the second month, in the year 1757, being then in good health, and abroad with friends visiting fa∣milies, I lodged at a friend's house, in Bur∣lington; and going to bed about the time usual with me, I awoke in the night, and
<PB N="53" REF="013782_0067_0F91A7AEF0A20AF0"/>
my meditations, as I lay, were on the good∣ness and mercy of the Lord; in a sense whereof my heart was contrite: after this, I went to sleep again; and sleeping a short time, I awoke; it was yet dark, and no ap∣pearance of day nor moonshine; and as I opened mine eyes, I saw a light in my cham∣ber at the apparent distance of five feet, about nine inches diameter, of a clear easy bright∣ness, and near its center the most radiant: as I lay still without any surprize looking upon it, words were spoken to my inward ear, which filled my whole inward man: they were not the effect of thought, nor any conclusion in relation to the appearance, but as the language of the Holy One spoken in my mind; the words were, CERTAIN EVI¦DENCE OF DIVINE TRUTH; and were again repeated exactly in the same manner; where∣upon the light disappeared.</P>
<P>Feeling the exercise in relation to a visit to the Southern Provinces to increase upon me, I acquainted our monthly-meeting therewith, and obtained their certificate: ex∣pecting to go alone, one of my brothers, who lived in Philadelphia, having some business in North-Carolina, proposed going with me part of the way; but as he had a view of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e outward affairs, to accept of him as a companion seemed some difficulty with me, whereupon I had conversation with him at sundry times; and, at length, feeling easy in my mind, I had conversation with several el∣derly friends of Philadelphia on the subject;
<PB N="54" REF="013782_0068_0F91A7B23275D4D8"/>
and he obtaining a certificate suitable to the occasion, we set off in the fifth month of the year 1757: and coming to Nottingham week∣day meeting, lodged at John Churchman's; and here I met with our friend Benjamin Buffington, from New-England, who was re∣turning from a visit to the Southern Pro∣vinces. Thence we crossed the river Sus∣quehannah, and lodged at William Cox's in Maryland; and soon after I entered this pro∣vince, a deep and painful exercise came upon me, which I often had some feeling of since my mind was drawn toward these parts, and with which I had acquainted my brother be∣fore we agreed to join as companions.</P>
<P>As the people in this and the Southern Pro∣vinces live much on the labour of slaves, many of whom are used hardly, my con∣cern was, that I might attend with singleness of heart to the voice of the true Shepherd, and be so supported as to remain unmoved at the faces of men.</P>
<P>As it is common for friends on such a vi∣sit to have entertainment free of cost, a dif∣ficulty arose in my mind with respect to saving my money by kindness received, which to me appeared to be the gain of op∣pression.</P>
<P>Receiving a gift, considered as a gift, brings the receiver under obligations to the benefactor, and has a natural tendency to draw the obliged into a party with the giver. To prevent difficulties of this kind, and to preserve the minds of judges from any bias,
<PB N="55" REF="013782_0069_0F91A7B338B39C18"/>
was that divine prohibition; <Q>Thou shalt not receive any gift: for a gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</Q> Exod. xxiii. 8. As the disci∣ples were sent forth without any provision for their journey, and our Lord said the work∣man is worthy of his meat, their labour in the gospel was considered as a reward for their entertainment, and therefore not re∣ceived as a gift; yet, in regard to my present journey, I could not see my way clear in that respect. The difference appeared thus: The entertainment the disciples met with, was from such whose hearts God had opened to receive them, from a love to them, and the truth they published: but we, considered as members of the same religious society, look upon it as a piece of civility to receive each other in such visits; and such reception, at times, is partly in regard to reputation, and not from an inward unity of heart and spi∣rit. Conduct is more convincing than lan∣guage; and where people, by their actions, manifest that the slave-trade is not so disa∣greeable to their principles but that it may he encouraged, there is not a sound uniting with some friends who visit them.</P>
<P>The prospect of so weighty a work, and be∣ing so distinguished from many who I es∣teemed before myself, brought me very low; and such were the conflicts of my soul, that I had a near sympathy with the prophet, in the time of his weakness, when he said, <Q>If thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray
<PB N="56" REF="013782_0070_0F91A7B37457F6A0"/>
thee, if I have found favour in thy sight;</Q> Numb. xi. 15. but I soon saw that this pro∣ceeded from the want of a full resignation to the divine will. Many were the afflictions which attended me; and in great abasement, with many tears, my cries were to the Al∣mighty, for his gracious and fatherly assist∣ance; and then, after a time of deep trial, I was favoured to understand the state men∣tioned by the psalmist more clearly than ever I had before; to wit: <Q>My soul is even as a weaned child.</Q> Psalm cxxxi. 2. Being thus helped to sink down into resignation, I felt a deliverance from that tempest in which I had been sorely exercised, and in calmness of mind went forward, trusting that the Lord Jesus Christ, as I faithfully attended to him, would be a councellor to me in all difficul∣ties; and that by his strength I should be en∣abled even to leave money with the members of society where I had entertainment, when I found that omitting of it would obstruct that work to which I believed he had called me: and as I copy this after my return, I may here add, that oftentimes I did so, under a sense of duty; the way in which I did it was thus: when I expected soon to leave a friend's house where I had entertainment, if I be∣lieved that I should not keep clear from the gain of oppression without leaving money, I spoke to one of the heads of the family pri∣vately, and desired them to accept of them pieces of silver, and give them to such of their negroes as they believed would make
<PB N="57" REF="013782_0071_0F91A7B455462EA8"/>
the best use of them; and at other times, I gave them to the negroes myself, as the way looked clearest to me: as I expected this be∣fore I came out, I had provided a large num∣ber of small pieces; and thus offering them to some who appeared to be wealthy people, was a trial both to me and them: but the fear of the Lord so covered me at times, that my way was made easier than I expected; and few, if any, manifested any resentment at the offer, and most of them, after some talk, accepted of them.</P>
<P>The seventh day of the fifth month, in the year 1757, lodged at a friend's house; and the next day, being the first of the week, was at Potapsco meeting; then crossed Patuxent river, and lodged at a publick-house.</P>
<P>On the ninth breakfasted at a friend's house; who afterward, putting us a little on our way, I had conversation with him, in the fear of the Lord, concerning his slaves; in which my heart was tender, and I used much plainness of speech with him, which he appeared to take kindly. We pursued our journey without appointing meetings, being pressed in my mind to be at the yearly-meet∣ing in Virginia; and in my travelling on the road, I often felt a cry rise from the center of my mind, thus: O Lord, I am a stran∣ger on the earth, hide not thy face from me. On the eleventh day of the fifth month, we crossed the rivers Patowmack and Rapahan∣nock, and lodged at Port-Royal: and on the way we happening in company with a colo∣nel
<PB N="58" REF="013782_0072_0F91A7B50188E608"/>
of the militia, who appeared to be a thoughtful man; I took occasion to remark on the difference in general betwixt a people used to labour moderately for their living, training up their children in frugality and business, and those who live on the labour of slaves; the former, in my view, being the most happy life: with which he concurred, and mentioned the trouble arising from the untoward, slothful disposition of the negroes; adding, that one of our labourers would do as much in a day as two of their slaves. I replied, that free men, whose minds were properly on their business, found a satisfac∣tion in improving, cultivating, and providing for their families; but negroes, labouring to support others who claim them as their pro∣perty, and expecting nothing but slavery during life, had not the like inducement to be industrious.</P>
<P>After some further conversation, I said, that men having power, too often misap∣plied it; that though we made slaves of the negroes, and the Turks made slaves of the Christians, I however believed that liberty was the natural right of all men equally: which he did not deny; but said, the lives of the negroes were so wretched in their own country, that many of them lived better here than there: I only said, there is great odds in regard to us, on what principle we act; and so the conversation on that subject ended: and I may here add, that another person, some time afterward, mentioned the wretch∣edness
<PB N="59" REF="013782_0073_0F91A7B5B82083D8"/>
of the negroes, occasioned by their intestine wars, as an argument in favour of our fetching them away for slaves: to which I then replied, if compassion on the Africans, in regard to their domestic troubles, were the real motives of our purchasing them, that spirit of tenderness being attended to, would incite us to use them kindly; that as stran∣gers brought out of affliction, their lives might be happy among us; and as they are human creatures, whose souls are as precious as ours, and who may receive the same help and comfort from the holy scriptures as we do, we could not omit suitable endeavours to instruct them therein: but while we mani∣fest by our conduct, that our views in pur∣chasing them are to advance ourselves; and while our buying captives taken in war, ani∣mates those parties to push on that war, and increase desolation amongst them; to say they live unhappy in Africa, is far from being an argument in our favour: and I further said, the present circumstances of these pro∣vinces to me appear difficult; that the slaves look like a burthensome stone to such who burthen themselves with them; and that if the white people retain a resolution to prefer their outward prospects of gain to all other considerations, and do not act conscientious∣ly toward them as fellow-creatures, I believe that burthen will grow heavier and heavier, till times change in a way disagreeable to us: at which the person appeared very serious; and owned, that in considering their condi∣tion,
<PB N="60" REF="013782_0074_0F91A7B686A7CBE0"/>
and the manner of their treatment in these provinces, he had sometimes thought it might be just in the Almighty so to order it.</P>
<P>Having thus travelled through Maryland, we came amongst friends at Cedar-Creek in Virginia, on the twelfth day of the fifth month; and the next day rode, in company with several friends, a day's journey to Camp-Creek: and as I was riding along in the morning, my mind was deeply affected in a sense I had of the want of divine aid to sup∣port me in the various difficulties which at∣tended me; and in an uncommon distress of mind, I cried in secret to the Most High, O Lord be merciful, I beseech thee, to thy poor afflicted creature. After some time, I felt in∣ward relief; and soon after, a friend in com∣pany began to talk in support of the slave-trade, and said, the negroes were understood to be the offspring of Cain, their blackness being the mark God set upon him after he murthered Abel his brother; that it was the design of Providence they should be slaves, as a condition proper to the race of so wick∣ed a man as Cain was: then another spake in support of what had been said. To all which, I replied in substance as follows: That Noah and his family were all who sur∣vived the flood, according to scripture; and as Noah was of Seth's race, the family of Cain was wholly destroyed. One of them said, that after the flood Ham went to the land of Nod, and took a wife; that Nod was a land far distant, inhabited by Cain's race,
<PB N="61" REF="013782_0075_0F91A7B757852DE0"/>
and that the flood did not reach it; and as Ham was sentenced to be a servant of ser∣vants to his brethren, these two families be∣ing thus joined, were undoubtedly fit only for slaves. I replied, the flood was a judg∣ment upon the world for their abominations; and it was granted, that Cain's stock was the most wicked, and therefore unreasonable to suppose they were spared: as to Ham's go∣ing to the land of Nod for a wife, no time being fixed, Nod might be inhabited by some of Noah's family, before Ham married a second time; moreover the text saith, <Q>That all flesh died that moved upon the earth.</Q> Gen. vii. 21. I further reminded them, how the prophets repeatedly declare, <Q>that the son shall not suffer for the iniqui∣ty of the father; but every one be an∣swerable for his own sins.</Q> I was trou∣bled to perceive the darkness of their imagi∣nations; and in some pressure of spirit said, the love of ease and gain are the motives in general of keeping slaves, and men are wont to take hold of weak arguments to support a cause which is unreasonable; and added, I have no interest on either side, save only the interest which I desire to have in the truth: and as I believe liberty is their right, and see they are not only deprived of it, but treated in other respects with inhumanity in many places, I believe He, who is a refuge for the oppressed, will, in his own time, plead their cause; and happy will it be for
<PB N="62" REF="013782_0076_0F91A7B7F6BE6398"/>
such, who walk in uprightness before him: and thus our conversation ended.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth day of the fifth month I was at Camp-Creek monthly-meeting, and then rode to the mountains up James-River, and had a meeting at a friend's house; in both which I felt sorrow of heart, and my tears were poured out before the Lord, who was pleased to afford a degree of strength by which way was opened to clear my mind amongst friends in those places. From thence I went to Fork-Creek, and so to Cedar-Creek again; at which place I now had a meeting; here I found a tender seed: and as I was pre∣served in the ministry to keep low with the truth; the same truth in their hearts answer∣ed it, that it was a time of mutual refresh∣ment from the presence of the Lord. I lodged at James Standley's, father of William Stand∣ley, one of the young men who suffered im∣prisonment at Winchester last summer, on account of their testimony against fighting; and I had some satisfactory conversation with him concerning it. Hence I went to the Swamp-meeting, and to Wayanoke-meet∣ing; and then crossed James-River, and lodged near Burleigh. From the time of my entering Maryland I have been much under sorrow, which of late so increased upon me, that my mind was almost overwhelmed; and I may say with the psalmist, <Q>in my dis∣tress I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God;</Q> who, in infinite goodness, looked upon my affliction, and in my pri∣vate
<PB N="63" REF="013782_0077_0F91A7B8B3A3D940"/>
retirement sent the Comforter for my re∣lief; for which I humbly bless his holy name.</P>
<P>The sense I had of the state of the churches, brought a weight of distress upon me: the gold to me appeared dim, and the fine gold changed; and though this is the case too ge∣nerally, yet the sense of it in these parts hath, in a particular manner, borne heavy upon me. It appeared to me, that through the prevailing of the spirit of this world, the minds of many were brought to an inward desolation; and instead of the spirit of meek∣ness, gentleness, and heavenly wisdom, which are the necessary companions of the true sheep of Christ, a spirit of fierceness, and the love of dominion, too generally prevailed. From small beginnings in errors, great buildings, by degrees, are raised; and from one age to another are more and more strengthened by the general concurrence of the people: and as men obtain reputation by their profession of the truth, their virtues are mentioned as arguments in favour of general error; and those of less note, to justify themselves, say, such and such good men did the like. By what other steps could the people of Judah arise to that heighth in wickedness, as to give just ground for the prophet Isaiah to de∣clare in the name of the Lord, <Q>that <HI>none</HI> calleth for justice, nor <HI>any</HI> pleadeth for truth:</Q> Isaiah lix. 4. or for the Almighty to call upon the great city of Jerusalem, just before the Babylonish captivity, <Q>If ye can
<PB N="64" REF="013782_0078_0F91A7BBDFC98ED8"/>
find a man, if there be any who executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.</Q> Jer. v. 1. The prospect of a road lying open to the same degeneracy, in some parts of this newly settled land of Ame∣rica, in respect to our conduct toward the negroes, hath deeply bowed my mind in this journey; and though to briefly relate how these people are treated is no agreeable work; yet, after often reading over the notes I made as I travelled, I find my mind engaged to preserve them. Many of the white people in those provinces take little or no care of negro marriages; and when negroes marry after their own way, some make so little account of those marriages, that with views of out∣ward interest, they often part men from their wives by selling them far asunder; which is common when estates are sold by executors at vendue. Many whose labour is heavy, being followed, at their business in the field, by a man with a whip, hired for that pur∣pose, have in common little else allowed but one peck of Indian corn and some salt for one week, with a few potatoes; the potatoes they commonly raise by their labour on the first day of the week.</P>
<P>The correction ensuing on their disobedi∣ence to overseers, or slothfulness in business, is often very severe, and sometimes desperate.</P>
<P>Men and women have many times scarce cloaths enough to hide their nakedness, and boys and girls, ten and twelve years old, are often quite naked amongst their master's chil∣dren:
<PB N="65" REF="013782_0079_0F91A7BCF800C2F0"/>
some of our society, and some of the society called new-lights, use some endea∣vours to instruct those they have in reading; but in common this is not only neglected, but disapproved. These are the people by whose labour the other inhabitants are in a great measure supported, and many of them in the luxuries of life: these are the people who have made no agreement to serve us, and who have not forfeited their liberty that we know of: these are the souls for whom Christ died; and for our conduct toward them, we must answer before Him who is no respecter of persons.</P>
<P>They who know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent, and are thus acquainted with the merciful, benevolent, gospel spirit, will therein perceive that the indignation of God is kindled against oppres∣sion and cruelty; and in beholding the great distress of so numerous a people, will find cause for mourning.</P>
<P>From my lodgings I went to Burleigh meeting, where I felt my mind drawn into a quiet resigned state; and after long silence, I felt an engagement to stand up; and thro' the powerful operation of divine love, we were favoured with an edifying meeting. The next meeting we had was at Black-Wa∣ter; and so to the yearly-meeting at the Western Branch: when business began, some queries were considered, by some of their members, to be now produced; and if ap∣proved, to be answered hereafter by their re∣spective
<PB N="66" REF="013782_0080_0F91A7BD39D29108"/>
monthly-meetings. They were the Pennsylvania queries, which had been exa∣mined by a committee of Virginia yearly-meeting appointed the last year, who made some alterations in them; one of which alte∣rations was made in favour of a custom which troubled me. The query was, "Are there any concerned in the importation of negroes, or buying them after imported?" which they altered thus: "Are there any concerned in the importation of negroes, or buying them to trade in?" As one query ad∣mitted with unanimity was, "Are any con∣cerned in buying or vending goods unlaw∣fully imported, or prize goods?" I found my mind engaged to say, that as we pro∣fessed the truth, and were there assembled to support the testimony of it, it was necessary for us to dwell deep, and act in that wisdom which is pure, or otherwise we could not prosper. I then mentioned their alteration; and, referring to the last mentioned query, added, as purchasing any merchandize taken by the sword, was always allowed to be in∣consistent with our principles; negroes be∣ing captives of war, or taken by stealth, those circumstances make it inconsistent with our testimony to buy them; and their being our fellow-creatures, who are sold as slaves, adds greatly to the iniquity. Friends ap∣peared attentive to what was said; some ex∣pressed a care and concern about their ne∣groes; none made any objection, by way of reply to what I said; but the query was ad∣mitted
<PB N="67" REF="013782_0081_0F91A7BE005FC3A0"/>
as they had altered it. As some of their members have heretofore traded in negroes, as in other merchandize, this query, be∣ing admitted, will be one step further than they have hitherto gone: and I did not see it my duty to press for an alteration; but felt easy to leave it all to Him, who alone is able to turn the hearts of the mighty, and make way for the spreading of truth on the earth, by means agreeable to his infinite wisdom. But in regard to those they already had, I felt my mind engaged to labour with them; and said, that, as we believe the scriptures were given forth by holy men, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and many of us know by experience that they are often help∣ful and comfortable, and believe ourselves bound in duty to teach our children to read them, I believe, that if we were divested of all selfish views, the same good spirit that gave them forth, would engage us to teach the negroes to read, that they might have the benefit of them: some there were amongst them who, at this time, manifested a concern in regard to taking more care in the educa∣tion of their negroes.</P>
<P>On the twenty-ninth day of the fifth month, at the house where I lodged, was a meeting of ministers and elders, at the ninth hour in the morning; at which time I found an engagement to speak freely and plainly to them concerning their slaves; mentioning, how they, as the first rank in the society, whose conduct in that case was much noticed
<PB N="68" REF="013782_0082_0F91A7BEC5B1F260"/>
by others, were under the stronger obliga∣tions to look carefully to themselves: expres∣sing how needful it was for them, in that si∣tuation, to be thoroughly divested of all self∣ish views; that living in the pure truth, and acting conscientiously toward those people in their education and otherwise, they might be instrumental in helping forward a work so exceeding necessary, and so much neglected amongst them. At the twelfth hour the meet∣ing of worship began; which was a solid meeting.</P>
<P>On the thirtieth day, about the tenth hour, friends met to finish their business, and then the meeting for worship ensued, which to me was a laborious time; but, through the goodness of the Lord, truth, I believe, gained some ground; and it was a strengthening opportunity to the honest-hearted.</P>
<P>About this time I wrote an epistle to friends in the back settlements of North-Carolina, as follows:</P>
<P>To friends at their monthly-meeting at New-Garden and Cane-Creek, in North-Caroli∣na.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT having pleased the Lord to draw me forth on a visit to some parts of Virginia and Carolina, you have often been in my mind; and though my way is not clear to
<PB N="69" REF="013782_0083_0F91A7BF6E881FE8"/>
come in person to visit you, yet I feel it in my heart to communicate a few things, as they arise in the love of truth: First, my dear friends, dwell in humility; and take heed that no views of outward gain get too deep hold of you, that so your eyes being single to the Lord, you may be preserved in the way of safety. Where people let loose their minds after the love of outward things, and are more engaged in pursuing the pro∣fits, and seeking the friendships of this world, than to be inwardly acquainted with the way of true peace; such walk in a vain shadow, while the true comfort of life is wanting: their examples are often hurtful to others; and their treasures, thus collected, do many times prove dangerous snares to their children.</P>
<P>But where people are sincerely devoted to follow Christ, and dwell under the influence of his holy spirit, their stability and firm∣ness, through a divine blessing, is at times like dew on the tender plants round about them, and the weightiness of their spirits se∣cretly works on the minds of others; and in this condition, through the spreading in∣fluence of divine love, they feel a care over the flock; and way is opened for maintain∣ing good order in the society: and though we meet with opposition from another spirit, yet, as there is a dwelling in meekness, feel∣ing our spirits subject, and moving only in the gentle peaceable wisdom, the inward re∣ward of quietness, will be greater than all our
<PB N="70" REF="013782_0084_0F91A7C02EE47C70"/>
difficulties. Where the pure life is kept to, and meetings of discipline are held in the authority of it, we find by experience that they are comfortable, and tend to the health of the body.</P>
<P>While I write, the youth comes fresh in my way:—Dear young people, choose God for your portion; love his truth, and be not ashamed of it; choose for your company such who serve him in uprightness: and shun, as most dangerous, the conversation of those whose lives are of an ill favour; for by frequenting such company, some hopeful young people have come to great loss, and been drawn from less evils to greater to their utter ruin. In the bloom of youth no orna∣ment is so lovely as that of virtue, nor any enjoyments equal to those which we partake of, in fully resigning ourselves to the divine will: these enjoyments add sweetness to all other comforts, and give true satisfaction in company and conversation, where people are mutually acquainted with it; and as your minds are thus seasoned with the truth, you will find strength to abide stedfast to the tes∣timony of it, and be prepared for services in the church.</P>
<P>And now, dear friends and brethren, as you are improving a wilderness, and may be numbered amongst the first planters in one part of a province, I beseech you, in the love of Jesus Christ, to wisely consider the force of your examples, and think how much your successors may be thereby affected: it is a
<PB N="71" REF="013782_0085_0F91A7C100BDC220"/>
help in a country; yea, and a great favour and a blessing, when customs first settled, are agreeable to sound wisdom: so when they are otherwise, the effect of them is grievous; and children feel themselves encompassed with difficulties prepared for them by their prede∣cessors.</P>
<P>As moderate care and exercise, under the direction of true wisdom, is useful both to mind and body; so, by this means in gene∣ral, the real wants of life are easily supplied: our gracious Father having so proportioned one to the other, that keeping in the true medium we may pass on quietly. Where slaves are purchased to do our labour, nume∣rous difficulties attend it. To rational crea∣tures bondage is uneasy, and frequently oc∣casions sourness and discontent in them; which affects the family, and such who claim the mastery over them: and thus people and their children are many times encompassed with vexations, which arise from their ap∣plying to wrong methods to get a living.</P>
<P>I have been informed that there are a large number of friends in your parts, who have no slaves; and in tender and most af∣fectionate love, I beseech you to keep clear from purchasing any. Look, my dear friends, to Divine Providence; and follow in simpli∣city that exercise of body, that plainness and frugality, which true wisdom leads to; so may you be preserved from those dangers which attend such who are aiming at out∣ward ease and greatness.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="013782_0086_0F91A7C421331988"/>
Treasures, though small, attained on a true principle of virtue, are sweet in the possession; and while we walk in the light of the Lord, there is true comfort and satisfac∣tion. Here, neither the murmurs of an op∣pressed people, nor throbbing uneasy consci∣ence, nor anxious thoughts about the events of things, hinder the enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>When we look toward the end of life, and think on the division of our substance among our successors; if we know that it was col∣lected in the fear of the Lord, in honesty, in equity, and in uprightness of heart before him, we may consider it as his gift to us; and with a single eye to his blessing, bestow it on those we leave behind us. Such is the happiness of the plain ways of true virtue. <Q>The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.</Q> Isa. xxxii. 17.</P>
<P>Dwell here, my dear friends; and then in remote and solitary deserts, you may find true peace and satisfaction. If the Lord be our God, in truth and reality, there is safe∣ty for us; for he is a strong hold in the day of trouble, and knoweth them that trust in him.</P>

From the yearly-meeting in Virginia, I went to Carolina; and on the first day of the sixth month, was at Wells monthly-meeting, where the spring of the gospel ministry was opened, and the love of Jesus Christ experi∣enced amongst us: to his name be the praise.</P>
<P>Here my brother joined with some friends from New-Garden, who were going home∣ward; and I went next to Simons-Creek monthly-meeting, where I was silent during the meeting for worship: and when business came on, my mind was exercised concerning the poor slaves; but did not feel my way clear to speak: in this condition I was bowed in spirit before the Lord; and with tears and inward supplication besought him, so to open my understanding, that I might know his will concerning me; and, at length, my mind was settled in silence: near the end of their business, a member of their meeting exprest a concern, that had some time lain upon him, on account of friends so much neglecting their duty in the education of their slaves; and proposed having meetings sometimes appointed for them on a week-day, to be only attended by some friends to be named in their monthly-meetings: many present appeared to unite with the proposal: one said, he had often wondered that they, being our fellow-creatures and capable of re∣ligious understanding, had been so exceeding∣ly neglected: another expressed the like con∣cern, and appeared zealous, that friends, in future, might more closely consider it: at
<PB N="74" REF="013782_0088_0F91A7C630BB5780"/>
length a minute was made; and the further consideration of it referred to their next monthly-meeting. The friend who made this proposal hath negroes: he told me, that he was at New-Garden; about two hundred and fifty miles from home, and came back alone; and that in this solitary journey, this exer∣cise, in regard to the education of their ne∣groes, was, from time to time, renewed in his mind. A friend of some note in Virgi∣nia, who hath slaves, told me, that he being far from home on a lonesome journey, had many serious thoughts about them; and that his mind was so imprest therewith, that he believed that he saw a time coming, when Divine Providence would alter the circum∣stance of these people, respecting their con∣dition as slaves.</P>
<P>From hence I went to Newbegun-Creek, and sat a considerable time in much weak∣ness; then I felt truth open the way to speak a little in much plainness and simplici∣ty, till, at length, through the increase of divine love amongst us, we had a seasoning opportunity. From thence to the head of Little-River on a first-day, where was a crouded meeting; and, I believe, was, thro' divine goodness, made profitable to some. Thence to the Old-Neck; where I was led into a careful searching out the secret work∣ings of the mystery of iniquity, which, un∣der a cover of religion, exalts itself against that pure spirit, which leads in the way of meekness and self-denial. From thence to
<PB N="75" REF="013782_0089_0F91A7C750D26198"/>
Pineywoods: this was the last meeting I was at in Carolina, and was large; and my heart being deeply engaged, I was drawn forth in∣to a fervent labour amongst them.</P>
<P>When I was at Newbegun-Creek, a friend was there who laboured for his living, hav∣ing no negroes, and had been a minister many years: he came to me the next day; and as we rode together, he signified that he wanted to talk with me concerning a difficul∣ty he had been under, and related it near as follows: to wit, That as monies had of late years been raised by a tax to carry on the wars, he had a scruple in his mind in regard to paying it, and chose rather to suffer distraint of his goods than pay it; and as he was the only person who refused it in those parts, and knew not that any one else was in the like circum∣stances, and signified that it had been a heavy trial to him; and more so, for that some of his brethren had been uneasy with his conduct in that case: and added, that from a sympathy he felt with me yesterday in meeting, he found the freedom thus to open the matter, in the way of querying concerning friends in our parts: whereupon I told him the state of friends amongst us, as well as I was able; and also, that I had, for some time, been under the like scruple. I believed him to be one who was concerned to walk uprightly before the Lord; and esteemed it my duty to preserve this note concerning him Samuel Newby.</P>
<P>From hence I went back into Virginia, and had a meeting near James Cowpland's; it
<PB N="76" REF="013782_0090_0F91A7C7ADA41CD0"/>
was a time of inward suffering; but, thro' the goodness of the Lord, I was made con∣tent: then to another meeting; where, thro' the renewings of pure love, we had a very comfortable season.</P>
<P>Travelling up and down of late, I have had renewed evidences, that to be faithful to the Lord, and content with his will concern∣ing me, is a most necessary and useful lesson for me to be learning; looking less at the ef∣fects of my labour, than at the pure motion and reality of the concern, as it arises from heavenly love. In the Lord Jehovah is ever∣lasting strength; and as the mind, by a hum∣ble resignation, is united to him, and we utter words from an inward knowledge that they arise from the heavenly spring, though our way may be difficult, and require close attention to keep in it; and though the man∣ner in which we may be led may tend to our own abasement; yet, if we continue in pa∣tience and meekness, heavenly peace is the re∣ward of our labours.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Curles-meeting; which, though small, was reviving to the honest-hearted. Thence to Black-Creek and Caroline meetings; from whence, accompa∣nied by William Standley before-mentioned, we rode to Goose-Creek, being much thro' the woods, and about one hundred miles.—We lodged, the first night, at a publick-house; the second, in the woods; and the next day, we reached a friend's house, at Goose-Creek. In the woods we lay under
<PB N="77" REF="013782_0091_0F91A7C881CD0388"/>
some disadvantage, having no fireworks nor bells for our horses; but we stopped a little before night, and let them feed on the wild grass which was plenty; in the mean time cutting with our knives a store against night, and then tied them; and gathering some bush∣es under an oak, we lay down; but the mus∣quetoes being plenty and the ground damp, I slept but little: thus lying in the wilder∣ness, and looking at the stars, I was led to contemplate on the condition of our first parents, when they were sent forth from the garden; but the Almighty, though they had been disobedient, continued to be a father to them; and shewed them what tended to their felicity as intelligent creatures, and was ac∣ceptable to him. To provide things relative to our outward living, in the way of true wisdom is good; and the gift of improving in things useful, is a good gift, and comes from the Father of lights. Many have had this gift; and, from age to age, there have been improvements of this kind made in the world: but some not keeping to the pure gift, have, in the creaturely cunning and self-exaltation, sought out many inventions; which inventions of men, as distinct from that uprightness in which man was created, as the first motion to them was evil, so the effects have been and are evil. That, at this day, it is as necessary for us constantly to attend on the heavenly gift, to be qualified to use rightly the good things in this life amidst great improvements, as it was for our
<PB N="78" REF="013782_0092_0F91A7C9429719E8"/>
first parents, when they were without any improvements, without any friend or father but God only.</P>
<P>I was at a meeting at Goose-Creek; and next at a monthly-meeting at Fairfax; where, through the gracious dealing of the Almighty with us, his power prevailed over many hearts. Thence to Manoquacy and Pipe-Creek, in Maryland; at both which places I had cause humbly to adore Him, who sup∣ported me through many exercises, and by whose help I was enabled to reach the true witness in the hearts of others: there were some hopeful young people in those parts. Thence I had meetings at John Everit's in Monalen, and at Huntingdon; and I was made humbly thankful to the Lord, who opened my heart amongst the people in these new settlements, so that it was a time of en∣couragement to the honest-minded.</P>
<P>At Monalen, a friend gave me some ac∣count of a religious society, among the Dutch, called mennonists; and, amongst other things, related a passage in substance as follows:—One of the mennonists having acquaintance with a man of another society at a consider∣able distance, and being with his waggon on business near the house of his said acquain∣tance, and night coming on, he had thoughts of putting up with him; but passing by his fields, and observing the distressed appear∣ance of his slaves, he kindled a fire in the woods hard by, and lay there that night: his said acquaintance hearing where he lodg∣ed,
<PB N="79" REF="013782_0093_0F91A7CB3942EB98"/>
and, afterward meeting theme nnonist, told him of it; adding, he should have been heartily welcome at his house; and from their acquaintance in former time, wondered at his conduct in that case: the mennonist re∣plied, ever since I lodged by thy field, I have wanted an opportunity to speak with thee: the matter was; I intended to have come to thy house for entertainment, but seeing thy slaves at their work, and observing the man∣ner of their dress, I had no liking to come to partake with thee: then admonished him to use them with more humanity; and added, as I lay by the fire that night, I thought that as I was a man of substance, thou would have received me freely; but if I had been as poor as one of thy slaves, and had no power to help myself, I should have received from thy hand no kinder usage than they.</P>
<P>Hence I was at three meetings in my way: and so I went home, under a humbling sense of the gracious dealings of the Lord with me, in preserving me through many trials and afflictions in my journey. I was out about two months, and travelled about ele∣ven hundred and fifty miles.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A FEW years past, money being made current in our province for carrying on wars, and to be called in again by taxes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid on the inhabitants, my mind was often af∣fected with the thoughts of paying such taxes; and I believe it right for me to pre∣serve a memorandum concerning it: I was told, that friends in England frequently paid taxes, when the money was applied to such purposes: I had conversation with several noted friends on the subject, who all favour∣ed the payment of such taxes; some of whom I preferred before myself, and this made me easier for a time; yet there was in the deeps
<PB N="81" REF="013782_0095_0F91A7CC311C4BD0"/>
of my mind, a scruple which I never could get over; and, at certain times, I was great∣ly distressed on that account.</P>
<P>I all along believed that there were some upright-hearted men, who paid such taxes; but could not see that their example was a sufficient reason for me to do so, while I be∣lieved that the spirit of truth required of me, as an individual, to suffer patiently the distress of goods, rather than pay actively.</P>
<P>I have been informed that Thomas à Kem∣pis lived and died in the profession of the Roman catholic religion: and in reading his writings, I have believed him to be a man of a true christian spirit; as fully so, as many who died martyrs because they could not join with some superstitions in that church.</P>
<P>All true christians are of the same spirit, but their gifts are diverse; Jesus Christ ap∣pointing to each one their peculiar office, agreeable to his infinite wisdom.</P>
<P>John Huss contended against the errors crept into the church, in opposition to the council of Constance; which the historian reports to have consisted of some thousand per∣sons. He modestly vindicated the cause which he believed was right; and though his lan∣guage and conduct toward his judges appear to have been respectful, yet he never could be moved from the principles settled in his mind. To use his own words: "This I most humbly require and desire of you all, even for His sake who is the God of us all, that I be not compelled to the thing which my
<PB N="82" REF="013782_0096_0F91A7CCF8DC6198"/>
conscience doth repugn or strive against." And again, in his answer to the emperor: "I refuse nothing, most noble emperor, whatsoever the council shall decree or deter∣mine upon me, only this one thing I except, that I do not offend God and my conscience." Fox's Acts and Monuments, page 233. At length, rather than act contrary to that which he believed the Lord required of him, he chose to suffer death by fire. Thomas à Kempis, without disputing against the arti∣cles then generally agreed to, appears to have laboured, by a pious example as well as by preaching and writing, to promote virtue and the inward spiritual religion: And I believe they were both sincere-hearted followers of Christ.</P>
<P>True charity is an excellent virtue: and sincerely to labour for their good, whose be∣lief, in all points, doth not agree with ours, is a happy state. To refuse the active pay∣ment of a tax which our society generally paid, was exceeding disagreeable; but to do a thing contrary to my conscience, appeared yet more dreadful. When this exercise came upon me, I knew of none under the like dif∣ficulty; and, in my distress, I besought the Lord to enable me to give up all, that so I might follow him wheresoever he was pleased to lead me: and under this exercise, I went to our yearly-meeting at Philadelphia, in the year 1755; at which a committee was ap∣pointed of some from each quarter, to cor∣respond with the meeting for sufferings in
<PB N="83" REF="013782_0097_0F91A7CDAE655990"/>
London, and another to visit our monthly and quarterly-meetings; and after their ap∣pointment, before the last adjournment of the meeting, it was agreed in the meeting, that these two committees should meet to∣gether in friends school-house in the city, at a time then concluded on, to consider some things in which the cause of truth was concerned; and these committees meet∣ing together, had a weighty conference in the fear of the Lord; at which time, I perceived, there were many friends under a scruple like that before-mentioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Christians refused to pay taxes to support heathen tem∣ples. See Primitive Christianity, part III. page 327.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As scrupling to pay a tax on account of the application, hath seldom been heard of heretofore, even amongst men of integrity, who have steadily borne their testimony against outward wars in their time; I may here note some things which have occurred to my mind, as I have been inwardly exer∣cised on that account: from the steady oppo∣sition which faithful friends, in early times, made to wrong things then approved of, they were hated and persecuted by men living in the spirit of this world; and suffering with firmness, they were made a blessing to the church, and the work prospered. It equally concerns men, in every age, to take heed to their own spirit; and in comparing their situ∣ation
<PB N="84" REF="013782_0098_0F91A616AEDD9AB8"/>
with ours, it looks to me there was less danger of their being infected with the spi∣rit of this world, in paying such taxes, than there is of us now: they had little or no share in civil government; and many of them de∣clared, they were, through the power of God, separated from the spirit in which wars were; and being afflicted by the rulers on account of their testimony, there was less likelihood of uniting in spirit with them in things in∣consistent with the purity of truth. We, from the first settlement of this land, have known little or no troubles of that sort: their profession, for a time, was accounted re∣proachful; but, at length, the uprightness of our predecessors being understood by the rulers, and their innocent sufferings moving them, our way of worship was tolerated; and many of our members in these colonies became active in civil government. Being thus tried with favour and prosperity, this world hath appeared inviting; our minds have been turned to the improvement of our country, to merchandize and sciences, amongst which are many things useful, being followed in pure wisdom; but in our present condition, that a carnal mind is gaining upon us, I be∣lieve will not be denied. Some of our mem∣bers, who are officers in civil government, are, in one case or other, called upon in their respective stations to assist in things relative to the wars; such being in doubt whether to act, or crave to be excused from their office, seeing their brethren united in the payment
<PB N="85" REF="013782_0099_0F91A617027A4AE8"/>
of a tax to carry on the said wars, might think their case not much different, and so quench the tender movings of the Holy Spi∣rit in their minds; and thus, by small degrees, there might be an approach toward that of fighting, till we came so near it, as that the distinction would be little else, but the name of a peaceable people.</P>
<P>It requires great self-denial and resigna∣tion of ourselves to God, to attain that state wherein we can freely cease from fighting when wrongfully invaded; if, by our fight∣ing, there were a probability of overcoming the invaders: whoever rightly attains to it, does, in some degree, feel that spirit in which our Redeemer gave his life for us; and, thro' divine goodness, many of our predecessors, and many now living, have learned this blessed lesson; but many others, having their religion chiefly by education, and not being enough acquainted with that cross which crucifies to the world, do manifest a temper distinguish∣able from that of an entire trust in God. In calmly considering these things, it hath not appeared strange to me, that an exercise hath now fallen upon some, which, as to the out∣ward means of it, is different from what was known to many of those who went before us.</P>
<P>Some time after the yearly-meeting, a day being appointed, and letters wrote to distant members, the said committees met at Phila∣delphia; and, by adjournments, continued several days. The calamities of war were now increasing; the frontier inhabitants of
<PB N="86" REF="013782_0100_0F91A617B37AD540"/>
Pennsylvania were frequently surprized, some slain, and many taken captive by the Indians; and while these committees sat, the corps of one so slain was brought in a waggon, and taken through the streets of the city, in his bloody garments, to alarm the people, and rouse them up to war.</P>
<P>Friends thus met were not all of one mind in relation to the tax; which to such who scrupled it made the way more difficult. To refuse an active payment at such a time, might be construed an act of disloyalty, and appeared likely to displease the rulers, not only here but in England; still there was a scruple so fastened upon the minds of many friends, that nothing moved it: it was a conference the most weighty that ever I was at; and the hearts of many were bowed in reverence before the Most High. Some friends of the said committees who appeared easy to pay the tax, after several adjournments, with∣drew; others of them continued till the last: at length, an epistle of tender love and cau∣tion, to friends in Pennsylvania, was drawn by some friends concerned, on that subject; and being read several times and corrected, was then signed by such of them as were free to sign it, and afterward sent to the monthly and quarterly-meetings.</P>
<P>On the ninth day of the eighth month, in the year 1757, at night, orders came to the military officers in our county, (Burlington) directing them to draft the militia, and pre∣pare a number of men to go off as soldiers,
<PB N="87" REF="013782_0101_0F91A61872045240"/>
to the relief of the English at fort William-Henry, in New-York government: a few days after which, there was a general review of the militia at Mount-Holly, and a num∣ber of men chosen and sent off under some officers. Shortly after, there came orders to draught three times as many, to hold them∣selves in readiness to march when fresh or∣ders came: and on the seventeenth day of the eighth month, there was a meeting of the military officers at Mount-Holly, who agreed on a draught; and orders were sent to the men so chosen, to meet their respective captains at set times and places; those in our township to meet at Mount-Holly; amongst whom were a considerable number of our society. My mind being affected herewith, I had fresh opportunity to see and consider the advantage of living in the real substance of religion, where practice doth harmonize with principle. Amongst the officers are men of understanding, who have some regard to sincerity where they see it; and in the exe∣cution of their office, when they have men to deal with whom they believe to be up∣right-hearted, to put them to trouble on ac∣count of scruples of conscience, is a painful task, and likely to be avoided as much as easily as may be: but where men profess to be so meek and heavenly-minded, and to have their trust so firmly settled in God, that they cannot join in wars; and yet, by their spirit and conduct in common life, manifest
<PB N="88" REF="013782_0102_0F91A619457AD118"/>
a contrary disposition, their difficulties are great at such a time.</P>
<P>Officers in great anxiety endeavouring to get troops to answer the demands of their su∣periors, seeing men, who are insincere, pre∣tend scruple of conscience, in hopes of be∣ing excused from a dangerous employment, they are likely to be roughly handled. In this time of commotion some of our young men left the parts, and tarried abroad till it was over; some came, and proposed to go as soldiers; others appeared to have a real tender scruple in their minds against joining in wars, and were much humbled under the apprehension of a trial so near: I had con∣versation with several of them to my satisfac∣tion. At the set time when the captain came to town, some of those last-mentioned went and told him in substance as follows:—That they could not bear arms for conscience-sake; nor could they hire any to go in their places, being resigned as to the event of it: at length the captain acquainted them all, that they might return home for the present, and required them to provide themselves as soldiers, and to be in readiness to march when called upon. This was such a time as I had not seen before; and yet I may say, with thankfulness to the Lord, that I believed this trial was intended for our good; and I was favoured with resignation to him. The French army taking the fort they were besieging, de∣stroyed it and went away: the company of
<PB N="89" REF="013782_0103_0F91A619F2F13E98"/>
men first draughted, after some days march, had orders to return home; and those on the second draught, were no more called upon on that occasion.</P>
<P>On the fourth day of the fourth month, in the year 1758, orders came to some officers, in Mount-Holly, to prepare quarters, a short time, for about one hundred soldiers: and an officer and two other men, all inhabitants of our town, came to my house; and the of∣ficer told me, that he came to speak with me, to provide lodging and entertainment for two soldiers, there being six shillings a week per man allowed as pay for it. The case being new and unexpected, I made no answer sud∣denly; but sat a time silent, my mind being inward: I was fully convinced, that the pro∣ceedings in wars are inconsistent with the purity of the christian religion; and to be hired to entertain men, who were then under pay as soldiers, was a difficulty with me. I expected they had legal authority for what they did; and, after a short time, I said to the officer, if the men are sent here for en∣tertainment, I believe I shall not refuse to ad∣mit them into my house; but the nature of the case is such, that I expect I cannot keep them on hire: one of the men intimated, that he thought I might do it consistent with my religious principles: to which I made no reply; as believing silence, at that time, best for me. Though they spake of two, there came only one, who tarried at my house about two weeks, and behaved himself civilly; and
<PB N="90" REF="013782_0104_0F91A61AD2FE84B0"/>
when the officer came to pay me, I told him I could not take pay for it, having admitted him into my house in a passive obedience to authority. I was on horseback when he spake to me: and as I turned from him, he said, he was obliged to me: to which I said nothing; but thinking on the expression, I grew uneasy; and afterwards, being near where he lived, I went and told him on what grounds I refused taking pay for keeping the soldier.</P>
<P>Near the beginning of the year 1758, I went one evening, in company with a friend, to visit a sick person; and before our re∣turn, we were told of a woman living near, who, of late, had several days been discon∣solate, occasioned by a dream; wherein death, and the judgments of the Almighty after death, were represented to her mind in a moving manner: her sadness, on that ac∣count, being worn off; the friend, with whom I was in company, went to see her, and had some religious conversation with her and her husband: with this visit they were somewhat affected; and the man, with many tears, expressed his satisfaction: and, in a short time after, the poor man being on the river in a storm of wind, he, with one more, was drowned.</P>
<P>In the eighth month of the year 1758, having had drawings in my mind to be at the quarterly-meeting in Chester county, and at some meetings in the county of Philadel∣phia, I went first to said quarterly-meeting,
<PB N="91" REF="013782_0105_0F91A61B6E8A3AF8"/>
which was large; and several weighty mat∣ters came under consideration and debate; and the Lord was pleased to qualify some of his servants with strength and firmness, to bear the burthen of the day: though I said but little, my mind was deeply exercised; and, under a sense of God's love, in the an∣ointing and fitting some young men for his work, I was comforted, and my heart was tendered before him. From hence I went to the youths meeting at Darby, where my be∣loved friend and brother Benjamin Jones met me, by an appointment before I left home, to join in the visit: and we were at Radnor, Merion, Richland, North-Wales, Plymouth, and Abington meetings; and had cause to bow in reverence before the Lord our graci∣ous God, by whose help way was opened for us from day to day. I was out about two weeks, and rode about two hundred miles.</P>
<P>The monthly-meeting of Philadelphia hav∣ing been under a concern, on account of some friends, who this summer (1758) had bought negro slaves: the said meeting moved it to their quarterly-meeting, to have the minute recon∣sidered in the yearly-meeting, which was made last on that subject: and the said quar∣terly-meeting appointed a committee to con∣sider it, and report to their next; which committee having met once and adjourned, and I going to Philadelphia to meet a com∣mittee of the yearly-meeting, was in town the evening on which the quarterly-meeting's
<PB N="92" REF="013782_0106_0F91A61EA0339378"/>
committee met the second time; and finding an inclination to sit with them, was, with some others, admitted; and friends had a weighty conference on the subject: and soon after their next quarterly-meeting, I heard that the case was coming to our yearly-meet∣ing; which brought a weighty exercise upon me, and under a sense of my own infirmi∣ties, and the great danger I felt of turning aside from perfect purity, my mind was of∣ten drawn to retire alone, and put up my prayers to the Lord, that he would be gra∣ciously pleased to strengthen me; that setting aside all views of self-interest and the friend∣ship of this world, I might stand fully re∣signed to his holy will.</P>
<P>In this yearly-meeting, several weighty matters were considered; and toward the last, that in relation to dealing with persons who purchase slaves. During the several sittings of the said meeting, my mind was frequent∣ly covered with inward prayer; and I could say with David, <Q>that tears were my meat day and night.</Q> The case of slave-keeping lay heavy upon me; nor did I find any en∣gagement to speak directly to any other mat∣ter before the meeting. Now when this case was opened, several faithful friends spake weightily thereto, with which I was com∣forted; and feeling a concern to cast in my mite, I said, in substance, as follows:</P>
<P>"In the difficulties attending us in this life, nothing is more precious than the mind of truth inwardly manifested; and it is my
<PB N="93" REF="013782_0107_0F91A62090F487C8"/>
earnest desire, that in this weighty matter, we may be so truly humbled as to be favour∣ed with a clear understanding of the mind of truth, and follow it; this would be of more advantage to the society, than any me∣dium not in the clearness of divine wisdom. The case is difficult to some who have them; but if such set aside all self-interest, and come to be weaned from the desire of getting es∣tates, or even from holding them together, when truth requires the contrary, I believe way will open that they will know how to steer through those difficulties."</P>
<P>Many friends appeared to be deeply bow∣ed under the weight of the work; and mani∣fested much firmness in their love to the cause of truth, and universal righteousness on the earth: and though none did openly justify the practice of slave-keeping in general, yet some appeared concerned, lest the meeting should go into such measures, as might give uneasiness to many brethren; alledging, that if friends patiently continued under the ex∣ercise, the Lord, in time to come, might open a way for the deliverance of these peo∣ple: and I finding an engagement to speak, said, "My mind is often led to consider the purity of the Divine Being, and the justice of his judgments; and herein my soul is co∣vered with awfulness: I cannot omit to hint of some cases, where people have not been treated with the purity of justice, and the event hath been lamentable: Many slaves on this continent are oppressed, and their cries

have reached the ears of the Most High. Such are the purity and certainty of his judgments, that he cannot be partial in our favour. In infinite love and goodness, he hath opened our understandings from one time to another, concerning our duty toward this people; and it is not a time for delay. Should we now be sensible of what he requires of us, and through a respect to the private in∣terest of some persons, or through a regard to some friendships which do not stand on an immutable foundation, neglect to do our du∣ty in firmness and constancy, still waiting for some extraordinary means to bring about their deliverance; it may be by terrible things in righteousness, God may answer us in this matter."</P>
<P>Many faithful brethren laboured with great firmness; and the love of truth, in a good degree, prevailed. Several friends, who had negroes, expressed their desire that a rule might be made, to deal with such friends as offenders who bought slaves in future: to this it was answered, that the root of this evil would never be effectually struck at, un∣til a thorough search was made into the cir∣cumstances of such friends who kept negroes, with respect to the righteousness of their motives in keeping them, that impartial jus∣tice might be administered throughout. Seve∣ral friends expressed their desire, that a visit might be made to such friends who kept slaves: and many friends said, that they be∣lieved

liberty was the negroes right; to which, at length, no opposition was made publicly: a minute was made more full on that sub∣ject, than any heretofore; and the names of several friends entered, who were free to join in a visit to such who kept slaves.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the eleventh day of the eleventh month, in the year 1758, I set out for Concord; the quarterly-meeting, heretofore held there, was now, by reason of a great increase of members, divided into two by the agreement of friends, at our last yearly meeting. Here
<PB N="96" REF="013782_0110_0F91A6237B91F830"/>
I met with our beloved friends Samuel Spa∣vold and Mary Kirby from England, and with Joseph White from Bucks county, who had taken leave of his family in order to go on a religious visit to friends in England; and, through divine goodness, we were fa∣voured with a strengthening opportunity to∣gether.</P>
<P>After this meeting I joined with my friends Daniel Stanton and John Scarborough, in visiting friends who had slaves; and at night we had a family meeting at William Trim∣ble's, many young people being there; and it was a precious reviving opportunity. Next morning we had a comfortable sitting with a sick neighbour; and thence to the burial of the corpse of a friend at Uwchland meeting, at which were many people, and it was a time of divine favour; after which, we vi∣sited some who had slaves; and, at night, had a family meeting at a friend's house, where the channel of gospel love was opened, and my mind was comforted after a hard day's labour. The next day we were at Go∣shen monthly-meeting: and thence, on the eighteenth day of the eleventh month, in the year 1758, attended the quarterly-meet∣ing at London-Grove, it being the first held at that place. Here we met again with all the before-mentioned friends, and had some edi∣fying meetings: and near the conclusion of the meeting for business, friends were incited to constancy in supporting the testimony of truth, and reminded of the necessity which
<PB N="97" REF="013782_0111_0F91A623B63B8F68"/>
the disciples of Christ are under to attend principally to his business, as he is pleased to open it to us: and to be particularly care∣ful to have our minds redeemed from the love of wealth; to have our outward affairs in as little room as may be; that no temporal con∣cerns may entangle our affections, or hinder us from from diligently following the dictates of truth, in labouring to promote the pure spirit of meekness and heavenly-mindedness amongst the children of men, in these days of calamity and distress; wherein God is vi∣siting our land with his just judgments.</P>
<P>Each of these quarterly-meetings were large, and sat near eight hours. Here I had occasion to consider, that it is a weighty thing to speak much in large meetings for business: first, except our minds are rightly prepared, and we clearly understand the case we speak to, instead of forwarding, we hinder busi∣ness, and make more labour for those on whom the burthen of the work is laid.</P>
<P>If selfish views, or a partial spirit, have any room in our minds, we are unfit for the Lord's work; if we have a clear prospect of the business, and proper weight on our minds to speak, it behoves us to avoid useless apologies and repetitions: where people are gathered from far, and adjourning a meet∣ing of business is attended with great diffi∣culty, it behoves all to be cautious how they detain a meeting; especially when they have sat six or seven hours, and have a great dis∣tance
<PB N="98" REF="013782_0112_0F91A62497B2AA68"/>
to ride home. After this meeting I rode home.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the twelfth month of the year 1758, I joined in company with my friends John Sykes and Daniel Stanton, in visiting such who had slaves: some, whose hearts were rightly exercised about them, ap∣peared to be glad of our visit; but in some places our way was more difficult; and I of∣ten saw the necessity of keeping down to that root from whence our concern proceeded; and have cause, in reverent thankfulness, humbly to bow down before the Lord, who was near to me, and preserved my mind in calmness under some sharp conflicts, and be∣gat a spirit of sympathy and tenderness in me, toward some who were grievously en∣tangled by the spirit of this world.</P>
<P>In the first month of the year 1759, hav∣ing found my mind drawn to visit some of the more active members, in our society at Philadelphia, who had slaves, I met my friend John Churchman there by an agreement; and we continued about a week in the city: we visited some that were sick, and some wi∣dows and their families; and the other part of our time was mostly employed in visiting such who had slaves—It was a time of deep exercise, looking often to the Lord for his as∣sistance; who, in unspeakable kindness, fa∣voured us with the influence of that spirit, which crucifies to the greatness and splendor of this world, and enabled us to go through
<PB N="99" REF="013782_0113_0F91A6253736F2E0"/>
some heavy labours, in which we found peace.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth day of the third month, of this year, I was at our Gene∣ral spring meeting at Philadelphia: after which, I again joined with John Churchman on a visit to some more, who had slaves in Philadelphia; and, with thankfulness to our heavenly Father, I may say, that divine love and a true sympathizing tenderness of heart, prevailed at times in this service.</P>
<P>Having, at times, perceived a shyness in some friends, of considerable note, towards me, I found an engagement in gospel love to pay a visit to one of them; and as I dwelt un∣der the exercise, I felt a resignedness in my mind to go: so I went, and told him in pri∣vate, I had a desire to have an opportunity with him alone; to which he readily agreed: and then, in the fear of the Lord, things relating to that shyness were searched to the bottom; and we had a large conference, which, I believe, was of use to both of us; and am thankful that way was opened for it.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth day of the sixth month, in the same year, having felt drawings in my mind to visit friends about Salem, and having the approbation of our monthly-meeting therein, I attended their quarterly-meeting, and was out seven days, and at seven meetings; in some of which I was chiefly silent, and in others, thro' the bap∣tizing power of truth, my heart was en∣larged
<PB N="100" REF="013782_0114_0F91A6260191BFA8"/>
in heavenly love, and found a near fellowship with the brethren and sisters, in the manifold trials attending their christian progress through this world.</P>
<P>In the seventh month, I found an in∣creasing concern on my mind to visit some active members in our society who had slaves; and having no opportunity of the company of such who were named on the minutes of the yearly-meeting, I went alone to their houses, and, in the fear of the Lord, acquainted them with the exercise I was un∣der: and thus, sometimes, by a few words, I found myself discharged from a heavy bur∣then.</P>
<P>After this, our friend John Churchman coming into our province with a view to be at some meetings, and to join again in the visit to those who had slaves, I bore him company in the said visit to some active mem∣bers, and found inward satisfaction.</P>
<P>At our yearly-meeting in the year 1759, we had some weighty seasons; where the power of truth was largely extended, to the strengthening of the honest-minded. As friends read over the epistles, to be sent to the yearly-meetings along this continent, I observed in most of them, both this year and last, it was recommended to friends to la∣bour against buying and keeping slaves; and in some of them closely treated upon. As this practice hath long been a heavy exercise to me, and I have often waded through mor∣tifying labours on that account; and, at
<PB N="101" REF="013782_0115_0F91A626AEB21DE8"/>
times, in some meetings been almost alone therein. Now observing the increasing con∣cern in our religious society, and seeing how the Lord was raising up and qualifying ser∣vants for his work, not only in this respect, but for promoting the cause of truth in ge∣neral, I was humbly bowed in thankfulness before him. This meeting continued near a week: and, for several days, in the forepart of it, my mind was drawn into a deep in∣ward stillness; and being, at times, covered with the spirit of supplication, my heart was secretly poured out before the Lord: and near the conclusion of the meeting for busi∣ness way opened, that, in the pure flowings of divine love, I expressed what lay upon me; which, as it then arose in my mind, was "first to shew how deep answers to deep in the hearts of the sincere and upright; though, in their different growths they may not all have attained to the same clearness in some points relating to our testimony: and I was led to mention the integrity and constancy of many martyrs, who gave their lives for the testi∣mony of Jesus; and yet, in some points, held doctrines distinguishable from some which we hold: and that, in all ages where people were faithful to the light and under∣standing which the Most High afforded them, they found acceptance with him; and that now, though there are different ways of thinking amongst us in some particulars, yet, if we mutually kept to that spirit and power which crucifies to the world, which teaches
<PB N="102" REF="013782_0116_0F91A627A886D8F0"/>
us to be content with things really needful, and to avoid all superfluities, giving up our hearts to fear and serve the Lord, true unity may still be preserved amongst us: and that if such, who were, at times, under sufferings on account of some scruples of conscience, kept low and humble, and in their conduct in life manifested a spirit of true charity; it would be more likely to reach the witness in others, and be of more service in the church, than if their sufferings were attend∣ed with a contrary spirit and conduct." In which exercise I was drawn into a sympa∣thizing tenderness with the sheep of Christ, however distinguished one from another in this world; and the like disposition appeared to spread over others in the meeting. Great is the goodness of the Lord toward his poor creatures.</P>
<P>An epistle went forth from this yearly-meeting, which I think good to give a place in this journal; being as follows:</P>

<P>To the quarterly and monthly meetings of friends belonging to the said yearly-meet∣ing.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly beloved friends and brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"IN an awful sense of the wisdom and good∣ness of the Lord our God, whose tender mercies have long been continued to us in this land, we affectionately salute you, with sincere and fervent desires, that we may re∣verently regard the dispensations of his pro∣vidence, and improve under them."</P>
<P>"The empires and kingdoms of the earth are subject to his Almighty power: He is the God of the spirits of all flesh; and deals with his people agreeable to that wisdom, the depth whereof is to us unsearchable: we, in these provinces, may say, He hath, as a gracious and tender parent, dealt bountifully with us, even from the days of our fathers: it was He who strengthened them to labour through the difficulties attending the improvement of a wilderness, and made way for them in the hearts of the natives; so that by them they were comforted in times of want and distress:
<PB N="104" REF="013782_0118_0F91A62AFAAD35B0"/>
it was by the gracious influences of his holy spirit, that they were disposed to work righ∣teousness, and walk uprightly one towards another, and towards the natives, and in life and conversation to manifest the excellency of the principles and doctrines of the christian religion; and thereby they retain their esteem and friendship: whilst they were labouring for the necessaries of life, many of them were fervently engaged to promote piety and vir∣tue in the earth, and educate their children in the fear of the Lord."</P>
<P>"If we carefully consider the peaceable measures pursued in the first settlement of the land, and that freedom from the desola∣tions of wars, which for a long time we en∣joyed, we shall find ourselves under strong obligations to the Almighty, who, when the earth is so generally polluted with wicked∣ness, gave us a being in a part so signally fa∣voured with tranquillity and plenty, and in which the glad tidings of the gospel of Christ are so freely published, that we may justly say with the psalmist, <Q>What shall we render unto the Lord for all his bene∣fits?</Q></P>
<P>"Our own real good, and the good of our posterity in some measure depends on the part we act; and it nearly concerns us to try our foundations impartially. Such are the different rewards of the just and unjust in a future state, that to attend diligently to the dictates of the spirit of Christ, to devote our∣selves to his service, and engage fervently in
<PB N="105" REF="013782_0119_0F91A62BEB21A428"/>
his cause, during our short stay in this world, is a choice well becoming a free intelligent creature; we shall thus clearly see and con∣sider that the dealings of God with mankind in a national capacity, as recorded in holy writ, do sufficiently evidence the truth of that saying, <Q>it is righteousness which ex∣alteth a nation;</Q> and though he doth not at all times suddenly execute his judgments on a sinful people in this life, yet we see by many instances, that where <Q>men follow lying vanities, they forsake their own mer∣cies;</Q> and as a proud selfish spirit prevails and spreads among a people, so partial judg∣ment, oppression, discord, envy and confu∣sions increase, and provinces and kingdoms are made to drink the cup of adversity as a reward of their own doings. Thus the in∣spired prophet, reasoning with the degene∣rated Jews, saith, <Q>Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of Hosts.</Q> Jer. ii. 19.</P>
<P>"The God of our fathers, who hath be∣stowed on us many benefits, furnished a ta∣ble for us in the wilderness, and made the desarts and solitary places to rejoice; he doth now mercifully call upon us to serve him more faithfully—We may truly say with the prophet, <Q>it is his voice which crieth to the city, and men of wisdom see his name:
<PB N="106" REF="013782_0120_0F91A62C10402BE8"/>
They regard the rod, and him who hath appointed it</Q>.—People who look chiefly at things outward, too little consider the ori∣ginal cause of the present troubles; but such who fear the Lord, and think often upon his name, they see and feel that a wrong spirit is spreading among the inhabitants of our country; that the hearts of many are waxed fat, and their ears dull of hearing; that the Most High, in his visitations to us, instead of calling, he lifteth up his voice and crieth; he crieth to our country, and his voice waxeth louder and louder. In former wars between the English and other nations, since the settlement of our provinces, the ca∣lamities attending them have fallen chiefly on other places, but now of late they have reached to our borders; many of our fellow subjects have suffered on and near our fron∣tiers, some have been slain in battle, some killed in their houses, and some in their fields, some wounded and left in great misery, and others separated from their wives and little children, who have been carried captives among the Indians: We have seen men and women, who have been witnesses of these scenes of sorrow, and being reduced to want, have come to our houses asking relief.—It is not long since it was the case of many young men in one of these provinces to be draughted, in order to be taken as soldiers; some where at that time in great distress, and had occasion to consider that their lives had been too little conformable to the purity and
<PB N="107" REF="013782_0121_0F91A62CCFECB8A0"/>
spirituality of that religion which we pro∣fess, and found themselves too little ac∣quainted with that inward humility, in which true fortitude to endure hardness for the truth's sake is experienced.—Many pa∣rents were concerned for their children, and in that time of trial were led to consider, that their care to get outward treasure for them, had been greater than their care for their settlement in that religion which cruci∣fieth to the world, and enableth to bear a clear testimony to the peaceable government of the Messiah. These troubles are removed, and for a time we are released from them."</P>
<P><Q>Let us not forget that the Most High hath his way in the deep, in clouds and in thick darkness</Q>—that it is his voice which crieth to the city and to the country; and oh! that these loud and awakening cries, may have a proper effect upon us, that heavier chastise∣ment may not become necessary! For though things, as to the outward, may, for a short time, afford a pleasing prospect; yet, while a selfish spirit, that is not subject to the cross of Christ, continueth to spread and prevail, there can be no long continuance in outward peace and tranquillity. If we desire an inhe∣ritance incorruptible, and to be at rest in that state of peace and happiness, which ever con∣tinues; if we desire in this life to dwell un∣der the favour and protection of that al∣mighty Being, whose habitation is in holi∣ness, whose ways are all equal and whose anger is now kindled, because of our back∣slidings
<PB N="108" REF="013782_0122_0F91A62D6E54CB48"/>
let us then awfully regard these beginnings of his sore judgments, and with abasement and humiliation turn to Him, whom we have offended."</P>
<P>"Contending with one equal in strength, is an uneasy exercise; but if the Lord is be∣come our enemy, if we persist to contend with Him who is Omnipotent, our over∣throw will be unavoidable."</P>
<P>"Do we feel an affectionate regard to poste∣rity; and are we employed to promote their happiness? Do our minds, in things out∣ward, look beyond our own dissolution; and are we contriving for the prosperity of our children after us? Let us then, like wise builders, lay the foundation deep; and by our constant uniform regard to an inward piety and virtue, let them see that we really value it: let us labour in the fear of the Lord, that their innocent minds, while young and tender, may be preserved from corrup∣tions; that as they advance in age, they may rightly understand their true interest, may consider the uncertainty of temporal things, and, above all, have their hope and confidence firmly settled in the blessing of that Almighty Being, who inhabits eternity, and preserves and supports the world."</P>
<P>"In all our cares about worldly treasures, let us steadily bear in mind, that riches pos∣sessed by children, who do not truly serve God, are likely to prove snares that may more grievously entangle them in that spirit of selfishness and exaltation, which stands in
<PB N="109" REF="013782_0123_0F91A6306170D638"/>
opposition to real peace and happiness; and renders them enemies to the cross of Christ, who submit to the influence of it."</P>
<P>"To keep a watchful eye towards real ob∣jects of charity, to visit the poor in their lonesome dwelling-places, to comfort them who, through the dispensations of Divine Providence, are in strait and painful circum∣stances in this life, and steadily to endeavour to honour God with our substance, from a real sense of the love of Christ influencing our minds thereto, is more likely to bring a blessing to our children, and will afford more satisfaction to a christian favoured with plen∣ty, than an earnest desire to collect much wealth to leave behind us, for <Q>here we have no continuing city;</Q> may we therefore di∣ligently <Q>seek one that is to come, whose builder and maker is God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are just, whatso∣ever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things and do them, and the God of peace shall be with you.</Q></P>
<P>Signed by appointment, and on behalf of our said meeting, by seven friends.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="110" REF="013782_0124_0F91A63088B41E70"/>
On the twenty-eighth day of the eleventh month, in the year 1759, I was at the quar∣terly-meeting in Bucks county: this day be∣ing the meeting of ministers and elders, my heart was enlarged in the love of Jesus Christ; and the favour of the Most High was ex∣tended to us in that and the ensuing meet∣ing.</P>
<P>I had conversation, at my lodging, with my beloved friend Samuel Eastburn; who expressed a concern to join in a visit to some friends, in that county, who had negroes; and as I had felt a draught in my mind to that work in the said county, I came home and put things in order: on the eleventh day of the twelfth month following, I went over the river; and on the next day was at Buckingham meeting; where, through the descendings of heavenly dew, my mind was comforted, and drawn into a near unity with the flock of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Entering upon this visit appeared weighty: and before I left home my mind was often sad; under which exercise I felt, at times, the Holy Spirit which helps our infirmities; through which, in private, my prayers were, at times, put up to God, that he would be pleased to purge me from all selfishness, that I might be strengthened to discharge my duty faithfully, how hard soever to the na∣tural part. We proceeded on the visit in a weighty frame of spirit, and went to the houses of the most active members, through∣out the county, who had negroes; and,
<PB N="111" REF="013782_0125_0F91A6315E04AD58"/>
through the goodness of the Lord, my mind was preserved in resignation in times of trial, and though the work was hard to nature, yet through the strength of that love which is stronger than death, tenderness of heart was often felt amongst us in our visits, and we parted from several families with greater satisfaction than we expected.</P>
<P>We visited Joseph White's family, he be∣ing in England; had also a family sitting at the house of an elder who bore us company, and was at Makefield on a first day: at all which times my heart was truly thankful to the Lord, who was graciously pleased to re∣new his loving-kindness to us, his poor ser∣vants, uniting us together in his work.</P>
<P>In the winter of this year, the small-pox be∣ing in our town, and many being inoculated, of which a few died, some things were open∣ed in my mind, which I wrote as follow:</P>
<P>The more fully our lives are conformable to the will of God, the better it is for us.—I have looked on the small-pox as a messenger from the Almighty, to be an assistant in the cause of virtue, and to incite us to consider whether we employ our time only in such things as are consistent with perfect wisdom and goodness.</P>
<P>Building houses suitable to dwell in, for ourselves and our creatures; preparing cloath∣ing suitable for the climate and season, and food convenient, are all duties incumbent on us: and under these general heads, are many branches of business, in which we
<PB N="112" REF="013782_0126_0F91A631F5C9C680"/>
may venture health and life, as necessity may require.</P>
<P>This disease being in a house, and my business calling me to go near it, it incites me to think, whether this business is a real indispensible duty; whether it is not in con∣formity to some custom, which would be better laid aside; or, whether it does not proceed from too eager a pursuit after some outward treasure. If the business before me springs not from a clear understanding, and a regard to that use of things which perfect wisdom approves; to be brought to a sense of it, and stopped in my pursuit, is a kind∣ness; for when I proceed to business with∣out some evidence of duty, I have found, by experience, that it tends to weakness.</P>
<P>If I am so situated that there appears no probability of missing the infection, it tends to make me think, whether my manner of life, in things outward, has nothing in it which may unfit my body to receive this messenger in a way the most favourable to me. Do I use food and drink in no other sort, and in no other degree, than was de∣signed by Him, who gave these creatures for our sustenance? Do I never abuse my body by inordinate labour, striving to accomplish some end which I have unwisely proposed? Do I use action enough in some useful em∣ploy? Or, do I sit too much idle, while some persons, who labour to support me, have too great a share of it? If, in any of these
<PB N="113" REF="013782_0127_0F91A632CC799E68"/>
things, I am deficient, to be incited to con∣sider it, is a favour to me.</P>
<P>There is employ necessary in social life; and this infection, which often proves mor∣tal, incites me to think, whether these social acts of mine are real duties: if I go on a visit to the widows and fatherless, do I go purely on a principle of charity, free from any selfish views? If I go to a religious meeting, it puts me on thinking, whether I go in sincerity and in a clear sense of duty; or whether it is not partly in conformity to custom, or partly from a sensible delight which my animal spirits feel in the com∣pany of other people; and whether to sup∣port my reputation as a religious man, has no share in it.</P>
<P>Do affairs, relating to civil society, call me near this infection? If I go, it is at the hazard of my health and life; and becomes me to think seriously, whether love to truth and righteousness is the motive of my attending; whether the manner of proceeding, is alto∣gether equitable; or whether aught of nar∣rowness, party interest, respect to outward dignities, names, or distinctions among men, do not stain the beauty of those assemblies, and render it doubtful, in point of duty, whether a disciple of Christ ought to attend as a member united to the body or not.</P>
<P>Whenever there are blemishes which, for a series of time, remain such; that which is a means of stirring us up to look atten∣tively on these blemishes, and to labour ac∣cording
<PB N="114" REF="013782_0128_0F91A6336F2CB8A0"/>
to our capacities, to have health and soundness restored in our country, we may justly account a kindness from our gracious Father, who appointed that mean.</P>
<P>The care of a wise and good man for his only son, is inferior to the regard of the great Parent of the universe for his creatures. He hath the command of all the powers and operations in nature; and "doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men:" chastisement is intended for instruction, and instruction being received by gentle chastise∣ment, greater calamities are prevented.</P>
<P>By an earthquake hundreds of houses are sometimes shaken down in a few minutes, and multitudes of people perish suddenly; and many more being crushed and bruised in the ruins of the buildings, pine away and die in great misery.</P>
<P>By the breaking in of enraged merciless armies, flourishing countries have been laid waste, and great numbers of people perished in a short time, and many more pressed with poverty and grief.</P>
<P>By the pestilence people have died so fast in a city, that through fear, grief and con∣fusion, those in health have found great dif∣ficulty in burying the dead, even without coffins.</P>
<P>By famine, great numbers of people, in some places, have been brought to the ut∣most distress, and pined away for want of the necessaries of life. Thus, where the kind invitations, and gentle chastisements, of a
<PB N="115" REF="013782_0129_0F91A6365E5332E8"/>
gracious God have not been attended to his sore judgments have, at times, been poured out upon people.</P>
<P>While some rules approved in civil so∣ciety, and conformable to human policy, so called, are distinguishable from the purity of truth and righteousness: while many pro∣fessing truth, are declining from that ardent love and heavenly mindedness, which was amongst the primitive followers of Jesus Christ: it is a time for us to attend diligent∣ly to the intent of every chastisement, and consider the most deep and inward design of them.</P>
<P>The Most High doth not often speak with an outward voice to our outward ears; but, if we humbly meditate on his perfections, consider that he is perfect wisdom and good∣ness, and to afflict his creatures to no pur∣pose, would be utterly reverse to his nature, we shall hear and understand his language, both in his gentle and more heavy chastise∣ments; and take heed that we do not, in the wisdom of this world, endeavour to escape his hand by means too powerful for us.</P>
<P>Had he endowed men with understanding to hinder the force of this disease by inno∣cent means, which had never proved mor∣tal nor hurtful to our bodies, such discovery might be considered as the period of chastise∣ment by this distemper, where that know∣ledge extended: but as life and health are his gifts, and not to be disposed of in our own wills, to take upon us, when in health,
<PB N="116" REF="013782_0130_0F91A6384CACE750"/>
a distemper, of which some die, requires great clearness of knowledge, that it is our duty to do so.</P>

<P>HAVING, for some time past, felt a sympathy in my mind with friends Eastward, I opened my concern in our month∣ly-meeting; and, obtaining a certificate, set forward on the seventeenth day of the fourth month, in the year 1760, joining in com∣pany, by a previous agreement, with my be∣loved friend Samuel Eastburn. We had meet∣ings at Woodbridge, Rahaway and Plain∣field; and were at their monthly-meeting of ministers and elders in Rahaway. We la∣boured under some discouragement; but, through the invisible power of truth, our vi∣sit was made reviving to the lowly minded, with whom I felt a near unity of spirit, be∣ing
<PB N="117" REF="013782_0131_0F91A6394A027060"/>
much reduced in my mind. We passed on, and visited chief of the meetings on Long-Island. It was my concern, from day to day, to say no more nor less than what the spirit of truth opened in me, being jea∣lous over myself, lest I should speak any thing to make my testimony look agreeable to that mind in people, which is not in pure obedience to the cross of Christ.</P>
<P>The spring of the ministry was often low; and, through the subjecting power of truth, we were kept low with it; and from place to place, such whose hearts were truly concern∣ed for the cause of Christ, appeared to be comforted in our labours; and, though it was in general a time of abasement of the creature, yet, through His goodness, who is a helper of the poor, we had some truly edifying seasons both in meetings, and in fa∣milies where we tarried; and sometimes found strength to labour earnestly with the unfaithful, especially with those, whose sta∣tion in families, or in the society was such, that their example had a powerful tendency to open the way for others to go aside from the purity and soundness of the blessed truth. At Jericho, on Long-Island, I wrote home as follows:</P>

<P>"As the present appearance of things is not joyous, I have been much shut up from outward chearfulness, remembering that pro∣mise, "Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord:"—as this, from day to day, has been revived in my memory, I have consi∣dered that his internal presence on our minds, is a delight of all others the most pure; and that the honest-hearted not only delight in this, but in the effect of it upon them. He who regards the helpless and distressed, and reveals his love to his children under afflic∣tion, they delight in beholding his benevo∣lence, and feeling divine charity moving up∣on them: of this I may speak a little; for though, since I left you, I have often found an engaging love and affection toward thee and my daughter, and friends about home, that going out at this time, when sickness is so great amongst you, is a trial upon me;

yet I often remember there are many wi∣dows and fatherless, many who have poor tutors, many who have evil examples before them, and many whose minds are in capti∣vity, for whose sake my heart is, at times, moved with compassion, that I feel my mind resigned to leave you for a season, to exercise that gift which the Lord hath bestowed on me; which, though small, compared with some, yet in this I rejoice, that I feel love unfeigned toward my fellow-creatures.

<P>We crossed from the east end of Long-Island to New-London, about thirty miles, in a large open boat; while we were out, the wind rising high, the waves several times beat over us, that to me it appeared danger∣ons; but my mind was, at that time, turn∣ed to Him, who made and governs the deep, and my life was resigned to him: and as he was mercifully pleased to preserve us, I had fresh occasion to consider every day as a day lent to me; and felt a renewed engagement to devote my time, and all I had, to Him who gave it.</P>
<P>We had five meetings in Narraganset; and went thence to Newport on Rhode-Island.
<PB N="120" REF="013782_0134_0F91A63CE9544AB0"/>
Our gracious Father preserved us in an hum∣ble dependance on him through deep exer∣cises, that were mortifying to the creaturely will. In several families in the country, where we lodged, I felt an engagement on my mind to have a conference with them in private concerning their slaves; and, thro' divine aid, I was favoured to give up there∣to: though, in this concern, I appear sin∣gular from many, whose service in travelling, I believe, is greater than mine; I do not think hard of them for omitting it; I do not repine at having so unpleasant a task as∣signed me, but look with awfulness to Him, who appoints to his servants their respective employments, and is good to all who serve him sincerely.</P>
<P>We got to Newport in the evening: and on the next day visited two sick persons, and had comfortable sittings with them; and in the afternoon attended the burial of a friend.</P>
<P>The next day we were at meetings at Newport, in the forenoon and afternoon; where the spring of the ministry was opened, and strength given to declare the Word of Life to the people.</P>
<P>The next day we went on our journey; but the great number of slaves in these parts, and the continuance of that trade from thence to Guinea, made deep impression on me; and my cries were often put up to my heavenly Father in secret, that he would enable me to discharge my duty faithfully, in such way as he might be pleased to point out to me.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="013782_0135_0F91A63DC8699850"/>
We took Swansea, Freetown, and Tanton, in our way to Boston; where also we had a meeting; our exercise was deep, and the love of truth prevailed, for which I bless the Lord. We went eastward about eighty miles beyond Boston, taking meetings, and were in a good degree preserved in an humble de∣pendance on that arm which drew us out; and, though we had some hard labour with the disobedient, laying things home and close to such as were stout against the truth; yet, thro' the goodness of God, we had, at times, to partake of heavenly comfort with them who were meek, and were often favoured to part with friends in the nearness of true gospel fel∣lowship. We returned to Boston, and had another comfortable opportunity with friends there; and thence rode back a day's journey eastward of Boston: our guide being a heavy man, and the weather hot, and my companion and I considering it, expressed our freedom to go on without him, to which he consented, and we respectfully took our leave of him; this we did, as believing the journey would have been hard to him and his horse.</P>
<P>We visited the meetings in those parts, and were measurably baptized into a feeling of the state of the society; and in bowedness of spirit went to the yearly-meeting at New∣port; where I understood that a large num∣ber of slaves were imported from Africa into that town, and then on sale by a member of our society. At this meeting we met with John Storer from England, Elizabeth Ship∣ley,
<PB N="122" REF="013782_0136_0F91A63FB3270438"/>
Ann Gaunt, Hannah Foster, and Mercy Redman from our parts, all ministers of the gospel, of whose company I was glad.</P>
<P>At this time my appetite failed, and I grew outwardly weak, and had a feeling of the condition of Habbakuk, as there ex∣pressed. "When I heard my belly trembled, my lips quivered, I trembled in myself that I might rest in the day of trouble;" I had ma∣ny cogitations, and was sorely distressed: and was desirous that friends might petition the legislature, to use their endeavours to discou∣rage the future importation of slaves; for I saw that this trade was a great evil, and tended to multiply troubles, and bring dis∣tresses on the people in those parts, for whose welfare my heart was deeply concerned.</P>
<P>But I perceived several difficulties in regard to petitioning; and such was the exercise of my mind, that I had thought of endeavour∣ing to get an opportunity to speak a few words in the House of Assembly, then setting in town. This exercise came upon me in the afternoon, on the second day of the yearly-meeting, and going to bed, I got no sleep till my mind was wholly resigned therein; and in the morning I enquired of a friend how long the Assembly were likely to conti∣nue sitting; who told me, they were expect∣ed to be prorogued that day or the next.</P>
<P>As I was desirous to attend the business of the meeting, and perceived the Assembly were likely to depart before the business was over; after considerable exercise, humbly
<PB N="123" REF="013782_0137_0F91A64033572C58"/>
seeking to the Lord for instruction, my mind settled to attend on the business of the meet∣ing; on the last day of which, I had pre∣pared a short essay of a petition to be pre∣sented to the legislature, if way opened: and being informed that there were some ap∣pointed, by that yearly-meeting, to speak with those in authority, in cases relating to the society, I opened my mind to several of them, and shewed them the essay I had made; and afterward opened the case in the meet∣ing for business, in substance as follows:</P>
<P>"I have been under a concern for some time, on account of the great number of slaves which are imported into this colony; I am aware that it is a tender point to speak to, but apprehend I am not clear in the sight of heaven without speaking to it. I have pre∣pared an essay of a petition, if way open, to be presented to the legislature; and what I have to propose to this meeting is, that some friends may be named to withdraw and look over it, and report whether they believe it suitable to be read in the meeting; if they should think well of reading it, it will re∣main for the meeting, after hearing it, to consider, whether to take any further notice of it as a meeting or not." After a short con∣ference some friends went out, and looking over it, expressed their willingness to have it read; which being done, many expressed their unity with the proposal; and some sig∣nified, that to have the subjects of the peti∣tion enlarged upon, and to be signed out of
<PB N="124" REF="013782_0138_0F91A640F05A8658"/>
meeting by such who were free, would be more suitable than to do it there: though I expected at first, that if it was done it would be in that way; yet, such was the ex∣ercise of my mind, that to move it in the hearing of friends when assembled, appeared to me as a duty; for my heart yearned to∣ward the inhabitants of these parts; believ∣ing that by this trade there had been an in∣crease of inquietude amongst them, and a way made easy for the spreading of a spirit oppo∣site to that meekness and humility, which is a sure resting-place for the soul: and that the continuance of this trade would not only render their healing more difficult, but in∣crease their malady.</P>
<P>Having thus far proceeded, I felt easy to leave the essay amongst friends, for them to proceed in it as they believed best. And now an exercise revived on my mind in relation to lotteries, which were common in those parts: I had once moved it in a former sitting of this meeting, when arguments were used in favour of friends being held ex∣cused, who were only concerned in such lot∣teries as were agreeable to law: and now on moving it again, it was opposed as before; but the hearts of some solid friends appeared to be united to discourage the practice a∣mongst their members; and the matter was zealously handled by some on both sides. In this debate it appeared very clear to me, that the spirit of lotteries was a spirit of selfish∣ness, which tended to confusion and dark∣ness
<PB N="125" REF="013782_0139_0F91A6440369C398"/>
of understanding; and that pleading for it in our meetings, set apart for the Lord's work, was not right: and in the heat of zeal, I once made reply to what an antient friend said, which when I sat down, I saw that my words were not enough seasoned with chari∣ty; and after this, I spake no more on the subject. At length a minute was made; a copy of which was agreed to be sent to their several quarterly-meetings, inciting friends to labour to discourage the practice amongst all professing with us.</P>
<P>Some time after this minute was made, I remaining uneasy with the manner of my speaking to the antient friend, could not see my way clear to conceal my uneasiness, but was concerned that I might say nothing to weaken the cause in which I had laboured; and then, after some close exercise and hearty repentance, for that I had not attended close∣ly to the safe guide, I stood up, and reciting the passage, acquainted friends, that tho' I dare not go from what I had said as to the matter, yet I was uneasy with the manner of my speaking, as believing milder lan∣guage would have been better. As this was uttered in some degree of creaturely abase∣ment, it appeared to have a good savor amongst us, after a warm debate.</P>
<P>The yearly-meeting being now over, there yet remained on my mind a secret, though heavy, exercise in regard to some leading ac∣tive members about Newport, being in the practice of slave-keeping. This I mentioned
<PB N="126" REF="013782_0140_0F91A644FAAD1A58"/>
to two antient friends, who came out of the country, and proposed to them, if way opened, to have some conversation with those friends: and thereupon, one of those country friends and I, consulted one of the most noted elders who had slaves; and he, in a respectful manner, encouraged me to pro∣ceed to clear myself of what lay upon me. Now I had, near the beginning of the yearly-meeting, a private conference with this said elder and his wife, concerning theirs; so that the way seemed clear to me, to advise with him about the manner of proceeding: I told him, I was free to have a conference with them all together in a private house; or if he thought they would take it unkind to be asked to come together, and to be spoke with one in the hearing of another, I was free to spend some time among them, and visit them all in their own houses: he expressed his lik∣ing to the first proposal, not doubting their willingness to come together: and as I pro∣posed a visit to only ministers, elders, and overseers; he named some others, whom he desired might be present also: and as a care∣ful messenger was wanted to acquaint them in a proper manner, he offered to go to all their houses to open the matter to them; and did so. About the eighth hour the next morning, we met in the meeting-house cham∣ber, and the last-mentioned country friend, also my companion, and John Storer with us: when, after a short time of retirement, I acquainted them with the steps I had taken
<PB N="127" REF="013782_0141_0F91A646E97ACA28"/>
in procuring that meeting, and opened the concern I was under; and so we proceeded to a free conference upon the subject. My exercise was heavy, and I was deeply bowed in spirit before the Lord, who was pleased to favour with the seasoning virtue of truth, which wrought a tenderness amongst us; and the subject was mutually handled in a calm and peaceable spirit: and, at length, feeling my mind released from that burthen which I had been under, I took my leave of them, in a good degree of satisfaction; and by the tenderness they manifested in regard to the practice, and the concern several of them ex∣pressed in relation to the manner of disposing of their negroes after their decease, I believ∣ed that a good exercise was spreading amongst them; and I am humbly thankful to God, who supported my mind, and preserved me in a good degree of resignation through these trials.</P>
<P>Thou, who sometimes travels in the work of the ministry, and art made very welcome by thy friends, seest many tokens of their satisfaction, in having thee for their guest. It is good for thee to dwell deep, that thou mayest feel and understand the spirits of peo∣ple: if we believe truth points towards a con∣ference on some subjects, in a private way, it is needful for us to take heed that their kindness, their freedom and affability, do not hinder us from the Lord's work. I have seen, that in the midst of kindness and smooth conduct, to speak close and home to them
<PB N="128" REF="013782_0142_0F91A647154A4D58"/>
who entertain us, on points that relate to their outward interest, is hard labour; and sometimes, when I have felt truth lead to∣ward it, I have found myself disqualified by a superficial friendship; and as the sense thereof hath abased me, and my cries have been to the Lord, so I have been humbled and made content to appear weak, or as a fool for his sake; and thus a door hath open∣ed to enter upon it. To attempt to do the Lord's work in our own way, and to speak of that which is the burthen of the word, in a way easy to the natural part, doth not reach the bottom of the disorder: To see the failings of our friends, and think hard of them, without opening that which we ought to open, and still carry a face of friendship, this tends to undermine the foun∣dation of true unity.</P>
<P>The office of a minister of Christ is weigh∣ty; and they who now go forth as watch∣men, had need to be steadily on their guard against the snares of prosperity and an out∣side friendship.</P>
<P>After the yearly-meeting, we were at meetings at Newtown, Cushnet, Long-Plain, Rochester and Dartmouth: from thence we sailed for Nantucket, in company with Ann Gaunt and Mercy Redman, and several other friends: the wind being slack, we only reached Tarpawling Cove the first day; where, going on shore, we found room in a publick-house, and beds for a few of us, the rest sleeping on the floor: we went on board again about
<PB N="129" REF="013782_0143_0F91A647B0DD6258"/>
break of day; and though the wind was small, we were favoured to come within about four miles of Nantucket; and then about ten of us getting into our boat, we rowed to the harbour before dark; whereupon a large boat going off, brought in the rest of the pas∣sengers about midnight: the next day but one was their yearly-meeting, which held four days; the last of which, was their month∣ly-meeting for business. We had a labori∣ous time amongst them; our minds were closely exercised, and I believe it was a time of great searching of heart: the longer I was on the island, the more I became sensible that there was a considerable number of va∣luable friends there, though an evil spirit, tending to strife, had been at work amongst them: I was cautious of making any visits, but as my mind was particularly drawn to them; and in that way we had some sittings in friends houses, where the heavenly wing was, at times, spread over us, to our mutu∣al comfort.</P>
<P>My beloved companion had very accepta∣ble service on this island.</P>
<P>When meeting was over, we all agreed to sail the next day, if the weather was suit∣able and we well; and being called up the latter part of the night, we went on board a vessel, being in all about fifty; but the wind changing, the seamen thought best to stay in the harbour till it altered; so we returned on shore: and feeling clear as to any further vi∣sits, I spent my time in our chamber chiefly
<PB N="130" REF="013782_0144_0F91A64871F18D90"/>
alone; and after some hours, my heart be∣ing filled with the spirit of supplication, my prayers and tears were poured out before my heavenly Father, for his help and in∣struction in the manifold difficulties which attended me in life: and while I was wait∣ing upon the Lord, there came a messenger from the women friends, who lodged at ano∣ther house, desiring to confer with us about appointing a meeting, which to me appeared weighty, as we had been at so many before; but after a short conference, and advising with some elderly friends, a meeting was appointed, in which the friend, who first moved it, and who had been much shut up before, was largely opened in the love of the gospel: and the next morning, about break of day, going again on board the vessel, we reached Falmouth on the Main before night; where our horses being brought, we pro∣ceeded toward Sandwich quarterly-meeting.</P>
<P>Being two days in going to Nantucket, and having been there once before, I observed many shoals in their bay, which make sail∣ing more dangerous, especially in stormy nights; also, that a great shoal, which en∣closes their harbour, prevents their going in with sloops, except when the tide is up; waiting without which, for the rising of the tide, is sometimes hazardous in storms: waiting within, they sometimes miss a fair wind. I took notice, that on that small island was a great number of inhabitants, and the soil not very fertile; the timber so
<PB N="131" REF="013782_0145_0F91A6492FBE6980"/>
gone, that for vessels, fences, and firewood, they depend chiefly on the buying from the Main the cost whereof, with most of their other expences, they depend principally upon the whale fishery to answer. I consi∣dered, that as towns grew larger, and lands near navigable waters more cleared, timber and wood would require more labour to get it: I understood that the whales being much hunted, and sometimes wounded and not killed, grew more shy and difficult to come at: I considered that the formation of the earth, the seas, the islands, bays and rivers, the motions of the winds and great waters, which cause bars and shoals in particular places, were all the works of Him who is perfect wisdom and goodness; and as people attend to his heavenly instruction, and put their trust in him, he provides for them in all parts, where he gives them a being. And as in this visit to these people, I felt a strong desire for their firm establishment on the sure foundation; besides what was said more pub∣lickly, I was concerned to speak with the women friends, in their monthly-meeting of business, many being present; and in the fresh spring of pure love, to open before them the advantage, both inward and out∣ward, of attending singly to the pure guid∣ance of the Holy Spirit, and therein to edu∣cate their children in true humility, and the disuse of all superfluities, reminding them of the difficulties their husbands and sons were frequently exposed to at sea; and that the more
<PB N="132" REF="013782_0146_0F91A64A0B42A8F0"/>
plain and simple their way of living was, the less need of running great hazards to support them in it; encouraging the young women in their neat decent way of attending themselves on the affairs of the house; shew∣ing, as the way opened, that where people were truly humble, used themselves to busi∣ness, and were content with a plain way of life, that it had ever been attended with more true peace and calmness of mind, than they have had who, aspiring to greatness and out∣ward shew, have grasped hard for an income to support themselves in it: and as I ob∣served, they had few or no slaves amongst them, I had to encourage them to be content without them; making mention of the nu∣merous troubles and vexations, which fre∣quently attend the minds of people, who de∣pend on slaves to do their labour.</P>
<P>We attended the quarterly-meeting at Sandwich, in company with Ann Gaunt and Mercy Redman, which was preceeded by a monthly-meeting; and in the whole held three days: we were various ways exer∣cised amongst them, in gospel love, accord∣ing to the several gifts bestowed on us; and were, at times, overshadowed with the virtue of truth, to the comfort of the sincere, and stirring up of the negligent. Here we parted with Ann and Mercy, and went to Rhode-Island, taking one meeting in our way, which was a satisfactory time; and reaching Newport the evening before their quarterly-meeting, we attended it; and after
<PB N="133" REF="013782_0147_0F91A64D15C7B2E8"/>
that, had a meeting with our young people, separated from those of other societies. We went thro' much labour in this town; and now, in taking leave of it, though I felt close inward exercise to the last, I found inward peace; and was, in some degree comforted, in a belief, that a good number remain in that place, who retain a sense of truth; and that there are some young people at∣tentive to the voice of the heavenly Shep∣herd. The last meeting, in which friends from the several parts of the quarter came together, was a select meeting; and through the renewed manifestation of the Father's love, the hearts of the sincere were united to∣gether.</P>
<P>That poverty of spirit and inward weak∣ness, with which I was much tried the fore part of this journey, has of late appeared to me as a dispensation of kindness. Appoint∣ing meetings, never appeared more weighty to me; and I was led into a deep search, whether in all things my mind was resigned to the will of God; often querying with my∣self, what should be the cause of such inward poverty; and greatly desired, that no secret reserve in my heart might hinder my access to the divine fountain. In these humbling times I was made watchful, and excited to attend the secret movings of the heavenly principle in my mind which prepared the way to some duties, that in more easy and prosperous times as to the outward, I believe I should have been in danger of omitting.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="013782_0148_0F91A64F08805888"/>
From Newport we went to Greenwich, Shanticut, and Warwick; and were helped to labour amongst friends in the love of our gracious Redeemer: and then, accompanied by our friend John Casey from Newport, we rode through Connecticut to Oblong, visited the meetings of friends in those parts, and thence proceeded to the quarterly-meeting at Ryewoods; and, thro' the gracious extend∣ings of divine help, had some seasoning op∣portunities in those places: so we visited friends at New-York and Flushing; and thence to Rahaway: and here our roads parting, I took leave of my beloved companion and true yoke-mate Samuel Eastburn; and reached home on the tenth day of the eighth month, 1760, where I found my family well: and for the favours and protection of the Lord, both inward and outward, extended to me in this journey, my heart is humbled in grateful acknowledgements; and find re∣newed desires to dwell and walk in resigned∣ness before him.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING felt my mind drawn toward a visit to a few meetings in Pennsylva∣nia, I was very desirous to be rightly in∣structed as to the time of setting off: and on the tenth day of the fifth month, 1761, be∣ing the first day of the week, I went to Had∣donfield meeting, concluding to seek for hea∣venly instruction, and come home or go on, as I might then believe best for me; and there, thro' the springing up of pure love, I felt en∣couragement, and so crossed the river. In this visit I was at two quarterly and three monthly-meetings; and, in the love of truth, felt my way open to labour with some noted friends, who kept negroes: and as I was favoured to keep to the root, and endeavoured to dis∣charge what I believed was required of me, I found inward peace therein, from time to time; and thankfulness of heart to the Lord, who was graciously pleased to be a guide to me.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="013782_0150_0F91A650B151B798"/>
In the eighth month, 1761, having felt drawings in my mind to visit friends in and about Shrewsbury; I went there, and was at their monthly-meeting, and their first-day meeting; and had a meeting at Squan, and another at Squankum; and, as way opened, had conversation with some noted friends concerning their slaves: and I returned home in a thankful sense of the goodness of the Lord.</P>
<P>From the care I felt growing in me some years, I wrote Considerations on keeping Negroes, part the second; which was print∣ed this year, 1762. When the overseers of the press had done with it, they offered to get a number printed to be paid for, out of the yearly-meeting stock, and to be given away; but I being most easy to publish them at my own expence, and offering my reasons they appeared satisfied.</P>
<P>This stock is the contribution of the mem∣bers of our religious society in general; amongst whom are some who keep negroes, and being inclined to continue them in sla∣very, are not likely to be satisfied with those books being spread amongst a people where many of the slaves are taught to read, and especially not at their expence; and such, of∣ten receiving them as a gift, conceal them: But as they who make a purchase, generally buy that which they have a mind for, I be∣lieved it best to sell them; expecting, by that means, they would more generally be read with attention. Advertisements being signed
<PB N="137" REF="013782_0151_0F91A65182782420"/>
by order of the overseers of the press, di∣rected to be read in monthly-meetings of bu∣siness within our own yearly-meeting, in∣forming where the books were, and that the price was no more than the cost of printing and binding them; many were taken off in our parts; some I sent to Virginia some to New-York, and some to Newport, to my ac∣quaintance there; and some I kept, expect∣ing to give part of them away, where there appeared a prospect of service.</P>
<P>In my youth I was used to hard labour; and though I was middling healthy, yet my nature was not fitted to endure so much as many others: that being often weary, I was prepared to sympathize with those whose cir∣cumstances in life, as free men, required con∣stant labour to answer the demands of their creditors; and with others under oppression. In the uneasiness of body, which I have ma∣ny times felt by too much labour, not as a forced but a voluntary oppression, I have of∣ten been excited to think on the original cause of that oppression, which is imposed on many in the world: and the latter part of the time wherein I laboured on our planta∣tion, my heart, through the fresh visitations of heavenly love, being often tender; and my leisure time frequently spent in reading the life and doctrines of our blessed Redeem∣er, the account of the sufferings of martyrs, and the history of the first rise of our society: a belief was gradually settled in my mind, that if such who had great estates, generally
<PB N="138" REF="013782_0152_0F91A6526D839898"/>
lived in that humility and plainness which belongs to a christian life, and laid much easier rents and interests on their lands and monies, and thus led the way to a right use of things, so great a number of people might be employed in things useful, that labour both for men and other creatures would need to be no more than an agreeable employ; and divers branches of business, which serve chiefly to please the natural inclinations of our minds, and which, at present, seems ne∣cessary to circulate that wealth which some gather, might, in this way of pure wisdom, be discontinued. And as I have thus consider∣ed these things, a query, at times, hath arisen: Do I, in all my proceedings, keep to that use of things which is agreeable to universal righteousness? And then there hath some de∣gree of sadness, at times, come over me; for that I accustomed myself to some things, which occasioned more labour than I believe divine wisdom intends for us.</P>
<P>From my early acquaintance with truth, I have often felt an inward distress, occasion∣ed by the striving of a spirit in me, against the operation of the heavenly principle; and in this circumstance have been affected with a sense of my own wretchedness, and in a mourning condition felt earnest longing for that divine help, which brings the soul into true liberty; and sometimes in this state, re∣tiring into private places, the spirit of sup∣plication hath been given me; and under a heavenly covering, have asked my gracious
<PB N="139" REF="013782_0153_0F91A652EEE3F3B8"/>
Father, to give me a heart in all things re∣signed to the direction of his wisdom, and in uttering language like this, the thoughts of my wearing hats and garments dyed with a dye hurtful to them, has made lasting im∣pressions on me.</P>
<P>In visiting people of note in the society who had slaves, and labouring with them in brotherly love on that account, I have seen, and the sight has affected me, that a con∣formity to some customs, distinguishable from pure wisdom, has entangled many; and the desire of gain to support these cus∣toms, greatly opposed the work of truth: and sometimes when the prospect of the work before me has been such, that in bowedness of spirit, I have been drawn into retired places, and besought the Lord with tears that he would take me wholly under his di∣rection, and shew me the way in which I ought to walk; it hath revived with strength of conviction, that if I would be his faith∣ful servant, I must in all things attend to his wisdom, and be teachable; and so cease from all customs contrary thereto, however used amongst religious people.</P>
<P>As he is the perfection of power, of wis∣dom, and of goodness; so I believe, he hath provided, that so much labour shall be ne∣cessary for men's support, in this world, as would, being rightly divided, be a suitable employment of their time; and that we can∣not go into superfluities, or grasp after wealth in a way contrary to his wisdom, without
<PB N="140" REF="013782_0154_0F91A655EE895868"/>
having connection with some degree of op∣pression, and with that spirit which leads to self-exaltation and strife, and which fre∣quently brings calamities on countries, by parties contending about their claims.</P>
<P>Being thus fully convinced, and feeling an increasing desire to live in the spirit of peace; being often sorrowfully affected with the thinking on the unquiet spirit in which wars are generally carried on, and with the mise∣ries of many of my fellow-creatures engaged therein; some suddenly destroyed; some wounded, and after much pain remain crip∣ples; some deprived of all their outward sub∣stance, and reduced to want; and some car∣ried into captivity. Thinking often on these things, the use of hats and garments dyed with a dye hurtful to them, and wearing more cloaths in summer than are useful, grew more uneasy to me; believing them to be customs which have not their foundation in pure wisdom. The apprehension of being singular from my beloved friends, was a strait upon me; and thus I remained in the use of some things contrary to my judgment.</P>
<P>On the thirty-first day of the fifth month, 1761, I was taken ill of a fever; and, after having it near a week, I was in great distress of body: and one day there was a cry rais∣ed in me, that I might understand the cause why I was afflicted, and improve under it: and my conformity to some customs, which I believed were not right, were brought to my remembrance; and in the continuation
<PB N="141" REF="013782_0155_0F91A657E37B0200"/>
of the exercise, I felt all the powers in me yield themselves up into the hands of Him who gave me being; and was made thank∣ful, that he had taken hold of me by his chastisement: feeling the necessity of further purifying, there was now no desire in me for health, until the design of my correction was answered; and thus I lay in abasement and brokenness of spirit, and as I felt a sink∣ing down into a calm resignation, so I felt, as in an instant, an inward healing in my nature; and from that time forward I grew better.</P>
<P>Though I was thus settled in mind in re∣lation to hurtful dyes, I felt easy to wear my garments heretofore made; and so continued about nine months. Then I thought of get∣ting a hat the natural colour of the furr; but the apprehension of being looked upon as one affecting singularity, felt uneasy to me: and here I had occasion to consider, that things, though small in themselves, being clearly enjoined by divine authority, became great things to us; and I trusted that the Lord would support me in the trials that might attend singularity, while that singularity was only for his sake: on this account, I was under close exercise of mind in the time of our General spring meeting 1762, greatly desiring to be rightly directed; when being deeply bowed in spirit before the Lord, I was made willing to submit to what I appre∣hended was required of me; and when I
<PB N="142" REF="013782_0156_0F91A658E97FCB68"/>
returned home, got a hat of the natural co∣lour of the furr.</P>
<P>In attending meetings, this singularity was a trial upon me, and more especially at this time, white hats being used by some who were fond of following the changeable modes of dress; and as some friends, who knew not on what motives I wore it, carried shy of me, I felt my way for a time shut up in the exercise of the ministry: and in this condition, my mind being turned toward my heavenly Father, with fervent cries that I might be preserved to walk before him in the meekness of wisdom, my heart was often tender in meetings; and I felt an inward consolation, which to me was very precious under those difficulties.</P>
<P>I had several dyed garments fit for use, which I believed it best to wear, till I had occasion of new ones: and some friends were apprehen∣sive, that my wearing such a hat favoured of an affected singularity: and such who spake with me in a friendly way, I generally in∣formed in a few words, that I believed my wearing it, was not in my own will. I had, at times, been sensible, that a superficial friendship had been dangerous to me; and many friends being now uneasy with me, I had an inclination to acquaint some with the manner of my being led into these things; yet, upon a deeper thought, I was for a time most easy to omit it, believing the present dispensation was profitable; and trusting, that
<PB N="143" REF="013782_0157_0F91A6590E8D5B68"/>
if I kept my place, the Lord in his own time would open the hearts of friends to∣ward me: since which, I have had cause to admire his goodness and loving-kindness, in leading about and instructing, and opening and enlarging my heart in some of our meetings.</P>
<P>In the eleventh month of the year 1762, feeling an engagement of mind to visit some families in Mansfield: I joined my beloved friend Benjamin Jones, and we spent a few days together in that service. In the second month 1763, I joined in company with Eli∣zabeth Smith and Mary Noble, on a visit to the families of friends at Ancocas; in both which visits, through the baptizing power of truth, the sincere labourers were often comforted, and the hearts of friends opened to receive us. And in the fourth month fol∣lowing, I accompanied some friends in a vi∣sit to the families of friends in Mount-Holly; in which my mind was often drawn into an inward awfulness, wherein strong desires were raised for the everlasting welfare of my fellow-creatures; and, through the kindness of our heavenly Father, our hearts were, at times, enlarged, and friends invited in the flowings of divine love to attend to that which would settle them on the sure foundation.</P>
<P>Having many years felt love in my heart toward the natives of this land, who dwell far back in the wilderness, whose ancestors were the owners and possessors of the land where
<PB N="144" REF="013782_0158_0F91A659B12F1C38"/>
we dwell; and who, for a very small consi∣deration, assigned their inheritance to us: and being at Philadelphia in the eighth month, 1761, on a visit to some friends who had slaves, I fell in company with some of those natives who lived on the east branch of the river Susquehannah, at an Indian town called Wehaloosing, two hundred miles from Philadelphia; and in conversation with them by an interpreter, as also by observations on their countenances and conduct, I believed some of them were measurably acquainted with that divine power which subjects the rough and froward will of the creature: and, at times, I felt inward drawings to∣ward a visit to that place of which I told none except my dear wife, until it came to some ripeness, and then in the winter, 1762, I laid it before friends at our monthly and quarterly, and afterwards at our General spring meeting; and having the unity of friends, and being thoughtful about an Indian pilot, there came a man and three women from a little beyond that town to Philadelphia on business: and I being informed thereof by letter, met them in town in the fifth month, 1763; and after some conversation, finding they were sober people, I, by the concurrence of friends in that place, agreed to join with them as companions in their return; and on the seventh day of the sixth month follow∣ing, we appointed to meet at Samuel Foulk's, at Richland in Bucks county. Now as this visit felt weighty, and was performed at a
<PB N="145" REF="013782_0159_0F91A65A759CA7B8"/>
time when travelling appeared perilous, so the dispensations of Divine Providence, in preparing my mind for it, have been memo∣rable; and I believe it good for me to give some hints thereof.</P>
<P>After I had given up to go, the thoughts of the journey were often attended with un∣usual sadness; in which times, my heart was frequently turned to the Lord with inward breathings for his heavenly support, that I might not fail to follow him wheresoever he might lead me: and being at our youth's meeting at Chesterfield, about a week before the time I expected to set off, was there led to speak on that prayer of our Redeemer to his Father: <Q>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</Q> And in attending to the pure openings of truth, had to mention what He elsewhere said to his Father; <Q>I know that thou hearest me at all times:</Q> so that, as some of his followers kept their places, and as his prayer was granted, it followed necessarily that they were kept from evil: and as some of those met with great hardships and afflictions in this world, and at last suffered death by cruel men; it appears, that whatsoever befalls men while they live in pure obedience to God, as it certainly works for their good, so it may not be considered an evil as it relates to them. As I spake on this subject, my heart was much tendered, and great awful∣ness came over me; and then, on the first
<PB N="146" REF="013782_0160_0F91A65B2F29B718"/>
day of the next week, being at our own af∣ternoon meeting, and my heart being en∣larged in love, I was led to speak on the care and protection of the Lord over his people, and to make mention of that passage where a band of Assyrians endeavouring to take captive the prophet were disappointed; and how the psalmist said, <Q>the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him.</Q> And thus, in true love and tenderness, I parted from friends, expecting the next morning to proceed on my journey; and being weary, went early to bed: and after I had been asleep a short time, I was awaked by a man calling at my door; and arising, was invited to meet some friends at a publick-house in our town, who came from Philadelphia so late, that friends were gene∣rally gone to bed: these friends informed me, that an express arrived the last morning from Pittsburgh, and brought news that the Indians had taken a fort from the English west∣ward, and slain and scalped English people in divers places, some near the said Pittsburgh; and that some elderly friends in Philadel∣phia, knowing the time of my expecting to set off, had conferred together, and thought good to inform me of these things, before I left home, that I might consider them, and proceed as I believed best; so I, going again to bed, told not my wife till morning. My heart was turned to the Lord for his heaven∣ly instruction; and it was an humbling time
<PB N="147" REF="013782_0161_0F91A65D223A44A0"/>
to me, When I told my dear wife, she ap∣peared to be deeply concerned about it; but in a few hours time, my mind became set∣tled in a belief, that it was my duty to pro∣ceed on my journey; and she bore it with a good degree of resignation. In this conflict of spirit, there were great searchings of heart, and strong cries to the Lord, that no motion might be in the least degree attended to, but that of the pure spirit of truth.</P>
<P>The subjects before-mentioned, on which I had so lately spoke in publick, were now very fresh before me; and I was brought in∣wardly to commit myself to the Lord, to be disposed of as he saw best. So I took leave of my family and neighbours, in much bowedness of spirit, and went to our month∣ly-meeting at Burlington; and after taking leave of friends there, I crossed the river, ac∣companied by my friends Israel and John Pemberton; and parting the next morning with Israel, John bore me company to Sa∣muel Foulk's; where I met the before-men∣tioned Indians, and we were glad to see each other: here my friend Benjamin Parvin met me, and proposed joining as a companion, we having passed some letters before on the subject; and now on his account I had a sharp trial; for as the journey appeared peri∣lous, I thought if he went chiefly to bear me company, and we should be taken cap∣tive, my having been the means of draw∣ing him into these difficulties, would add to my own afflictions: so I told him my mind
<PB N="148" REF="013782_0162_0F91A65D7548D2C8"/>
freely, and let him know that I was resign∣ed to go alone; but after all, if he really be∣lieved it to be his duty to go on, I believed his company would be very comfortable to me: it was indeed a time of deep exercise, and Benjamin appeared to be so fastened to the visit, that he could not be easy to leave me; so we went on, accompanied by our friends John Pemberton, and William Light∣foot of Pikeland, and lodged at Bethlehem; and there parting with John, William and we went forward on the ninth day of the sixth month, and got lodging on the floor of a house, about five miles from Fort-Allen; here we parted with William: and at this place we met with an Indian trader, lately come from Wioming; and in conversation with him, I perceived that many white people do often sell rum to the Indians, which, I believe, is a great evil; first, they being thereby deprived of the use of their reason, and their spirits vi∣olently agitated, quarrels often arise which end in mischief; and the bitterness and resent∣ments occasioned hereby, are frequently of long continuance: again, their skins and furrs, gotten thro' much fatigue and hard tra∣vels in hunting, with which they intended to buy cloathing, when they become in∣toxicated, they often sell at a low rate for more rum; and afterward, when they suffer for want of the necessaries of life, are an∣gry with those who, for the sake of gain, took the advantage of their weakness: of this their chiefs have often complained, at
<PB N="149" REF="013782_0163_0F91A65E8B54CD78"/>
their treaties with the English. Where cun∣ning people pass counterfeits, and impose that on others which is good for nothing, it is considered as a wickedness; but to sell that to people which we know does them harm, and which often works their ruin, for the sake of gain, manifests a hardened and corrupt heart; and is an evil, which de∣mands the care of all true lovers of virtue to suppress: and while my mind, this even∣ing, was thus employed, I also remember∣ed, that the people on the frontiers, among whom this evil is too common, are often poor; who venture to the outside of a colo∣ny, that they may live more independant on such who are wealthy, who often set high rents on their land: being renewedly con∣firmed in a belief, that if all our inhabi∣tants lived according to sound wisdom, la∣bouring to promote universal love and righ∣teousness, and ceased from every inordinate desire after wealth, and from all customs which are tinctured with luxury, the way would be easy for our inhabitants, though much more numerous than at present, to live comfortably on honest employments, with∣out having that temptation they are often under of being drawn into schemes to make settlements on lands which have not been purchased of the Indians, or of applying to that wicked practice of selling rum to them.</P>
<P>On the tenth day of the month we set out early in the morning, and crossed the west∣ern branch of Delaware, called the Great
<PB N="150" REF="013782_0164_0F91A661F4610EC0"/>
Lehie, near Fort-Allen; the water being high, we went over in a canoe: here we met an Indian, and had some friendly con∣versation with him, and gave him some bis∣cuit; and he having killed a deer, gave the Indians with us some of it: then after tra∣velling some miles, we met several Indian men and women with a cow and horse, and some houshold goods, who were lately come from their dwelling at Wioming, and going to settle at another place; we made them some small presents; and some of them un∣derstanding English, I told them my motive in coming into their country; with which they appeared satisfied: and one of our guides talking a while with an antient wo∣man concerning us, the poor old woman came to my companion and me, and took her leave of us with an appearance of sin∣cere affection. So going on, we pitched our tent near the banks of the same river, hav∣ing laboured hard in crossing some of those mountains called the Blue Ridge; and by the roughness of the stones, and the cavi∣ties between them, and the steepness of the hills, it appeared dangerous: but we were preserved in safety, through the kindness of Him whose works in those mountainous de∣serts appeared awful; toward whom my heart was turned during this day's travel.</P>
<P>Near our tent, on the sides of large trees peeled for that purpose, were various repre∣sentations of men going to, and returning from the wars, and of some killed in battle.
<PB N="151" REF="013782_0165_0F91A66307CB7BC0"/>
This being a path heretofore used by warriors; and as I walked about viewing those Indian histories, which were painted mostly in red but some in black, and think∣ing on the innumerable afflictions which the proud, fierce spirit produceth in the world; thinking on the toils and fatigues of warriors, travelling over mountains and de∣serts; thinking on their miseries and dis∣tresses when wounded far from home by their enemies; and of their bruises and great weariness in chasing one another over the rocks and mountains; and of their restless, unquiet state of mind, who live in this spi∣rit; and of the hatred which mutually grows up in the minds of the children of those na∣tions engaged in war with each other: dur∣ing these meditations, the desire to cherish the spirit of love and peace amongst these people, arose very fresh in me. This was the first night that we lodged in the woods; and being wet with travelling in the rain, the ground, our tent, and the bushes which we purposed to lay under our blankets also wet, all looked discouraging; but I believed, that it was the Lord who had thus far brought me forward, and that he would dispose of me as he saw good, and therein I felt easy: so we kindled a fire, with our tent open to it; and with some bushes next the ground, and then our blankets, we made our bed; and lying down, got some sleep: and in the morning, feeling a little unwell,
<PB N="152" REF="013782_0166_0F91A664F2D49E78"/>
I went into the river; the water was cold, but soon after I felt fresh and well.</P>
<P>The eleventh day of the sixth month, the bushes being wet, we tarried in our tent till about eight o'clock; when going on, crossed a high mountain supposed to be upward of four miles over; the steepness on the north side exceeding all the others: we also crossed two swamps; and it raining near night, we pitched our tent and lodged.</P>
<P>About noon, on our way, we were over∣taken by one of the moravian brethren, go∣ing to Wehaloosing, and an Indian man with him who could talk English; and we being together while our horses eat grass, had some friendly conversation; but they tra∣velling faster than we, soon left us. This moravian, I understood, had spent some time this spring at Wehaloosing; and was, by some of the Indians, invited to come again.</P>
<P>The twelfth day of the sixth month, and first of the week, it being a rainy day, we continued in our tent; and here I was led to think on the nature of the exercise which hath attended me: Love was the first motion, and thence a concern arose to spend some time with the Indians, that I might feel and un∣derstand their life, and the spirit they live in, if haply I might receive some instruction from them, or they be in any degree helped forward by my following the leadings of truth amongst them: and as it pleased the Lord to make way for my going at a time
<PB N="153" REF="013782_0167_0F91A665C4017F58"/>
when the troubles of war were increasing, and when, by reason of much wet weather, travelling was more difficult than usual at that season, I looked upon it as a more fa∣vourable opportunity to season my mind, and bring me into a nearer sympathy with them: and as mine eye was to the great Fa∣ther of mercies, humbly desiring to learn what his will was concerning me, I was made quiet and content.</P>
<P>Our guide's horse, though hoppled, went away in the night; and after finding our own, and searching some time for him, his footsteps were discovered in the path going back again, whereupon my kind companion went off in the rain, and after about seven hours returned with him: and here we lodged again; tying up our horses before we went to bed, and loosing them to feed about break of day.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth day of the sixth month, the sun appearing, we set forward; and as I rode over the barren hills, my meditations were on the alterations of the circumstances of the natives of this land since the coming in of the English. The lands near the sea, are conveniently situated for fishing; the lands near the rivers, where the tides flow, and some above, are in many places fertile, and not mountainous; while the running of the tides, makes passing up and down easy with any kind of traffick. Those natives have, in some places, for trifling considera∣tions, sold their inheritance so favourably
<PB N="154" REF="013782_0168_0F91A667ADCE2688"/>
situated; and in other places, been driven back by superior force: so that, in many places, as their way of cloathing themselves is now altered from what it was, and they, far remote from us, have to pass over moun∣tains, swamps, and barren desarts, where travelling is very troublesome, in bringing their skins and furrs to trade with us.</P>
<P>By the extending of English settlements, and partly by English hunters, the wild beasts they chiefly depend on for a subsist∣ance, are not so plenty as they were; and people too often, for the sake of gain, open a door for them to waste their skins and furrs, in purchasing a liquor which tends to the ruin of them and their families.</P>
<P>My own will and desires being now very much broken, and my heart, with much earnestness, turned to the Lord, to whom alone I looked for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the dangers before me. I had a prospect of the English along the coast, for upwards of nine hundred miles, where I have travelled; and the fa∣vourable situation of the English, and the difficulties attending the natives in many places, and the negroes, were open before me; and a weighty and heavenly care came over my mind, and love filled my heart to∣ward all mankind, in which I felt a strong engagement, that we might be obedient to the Lord while, in tender mercies, he is yet calling to us; and so attend to pure univer∣sal righteousness, as to give no just cause of offence to the Gentiles, who do not profess
<PB N="155" REF="013782_0169_0F91A667F3BD1248"/>
christianity, whether the blacks from Africa or the native inhabitants of this continent: and here I was led into a close, laborious enquiry, whether I, as an individual, kept clear from all things which tended to stir up, or were connected with wars, either in this land or Africa; and my heart was deeply concerned, that in future I might in all things keep steadily to the pure truth, and live and walk in the plainness and simplicity of a sincere follower of Christ. And in this lonely journey, I did, this day, greatly be∣wail the spreading of a wrong spirit, be∣lieving, that the prosperous, convenient si∣tuation of the English, requires a constant attention to divine love and wisdom to guide and support us in a way answerable to the will of that good, gracious, and almighty Being, who hath an equal regard to all man∣kind: and here, luxury and covetousness, with the numerous oppressions, and other evils attending them, appeared very afflict∣ing to me; and I felt in that which is im∣mutable, that the seeds of great calamity and desolation are sown and growing fast on this continent: nor have I words sufficient to set forth that longing I then felt, that we, who are placed along the coast, and have tasted the love and goodness of God, might arise in his strength; and, like faithful messen∣gers, labour to check the growth of these seeds, that they may not ripen to the ruin of our posterity.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="013782_0170_0F91A668CC845C68"/>
We reached the Indian settlement at Wio∣ming: and here we were told, that an In∣dian runner had been at that place a day or two before us, and brought news of the In∣dians taking an English fort westward, and destroying the people, and that they were endeavouring to take another; and also, that another Indian runner came there about the middle of the night before we got there, who came from a town about ten miles above Wehaloosing, and brought news, that some Indian warriors, from distant parts, came to that town with two English scalps; and told the people, that it was war with the English.</P>
<P>Our guides took us to the house of a very antient man; and soon after we had put in our baggage, there came a man from ano∣ther Indian house some distance off; and I perceiving there was a man near the door, went out; and he having a tomahawk wrapped under his matchcoat out of sight, as I approached him, he took it in his hand; I, however, went forward, and speaking to him in a friendly way perceived he under∣stood some English: my companion then coming out, we had some talk with him concerning the nature of our visit in these parts; and then he going into the house with us, and talking with our guides, soon appeared friendly, and sat down and smoak∣ed his pipe. Tho' his taking his hatchet in his hand at the instant I drew near to him,
<PB N="157" REF="013782_0171_0F91A66979497B48"/>
had a disagreeable appearance, I believe he had no other intent than to be in readiness in case any violence was offered to him.</P>
<P>Hearing the news brought by these In∣dian runners, and being told by the Indians where we lodged, that what Indians were about Wioming expected, in a few days, to move to some larger towns, I thought that, to all outward appearance, it was dangerous travelling at this time; and was, after a hard day's journey, brought into a painful exercise at night, in which I had to trace back, and view over the steps I had taken from my first moving in the visit; and tho' I had to bewail some weakness which, at times, had attended me, yet I could not find that I had ever given way to a will∣ful disobedience: and then as I believed I had, under a sense of duty, come thus far, I was now earnest in spirit beseeching the Lord to shew me what I ought to do. In this great distress I grew jealous of myself, lest the desire of reputation, as a man firmly settled to persevere through dan∣gers, or the fear of disgrace arising on my returning without performing the vi∣sit, might have some place in me: thus I lay, full of thoughts, great part of the night, while my beloved companion lay and slept by me; till the Lord, my gracious Father, who saw the conflicts of my soul, was pleased to give quietness: then I was again strengthened to commit my life, and all things relating thereto, into his heavenly
<PB N="158" REF="013782_0172_0F91A66A5A230E28"/>
hands; and getting a little sleep toward day, when morning came we arose.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth day of the sixth month, we sought out and visited all the Indians hereabouts that we could meet with; they being chiefly in one place, about a mile from where we lodged, in all perhaps twenty. Here I expressed the care I had on my mind for their good; and told them, that true love had made me willing thus to leave my family to come and see the Indians, and speak with them in their houses. Some of them appeared kind and friendly. So we took our leave of these Indians: and went up the river Susquehannah, about three miles, to the house of an Indian, called Ja∣cob January, who had killed his hog; and the women were making store of bread, and preparing to move up the river. Here our pilots left their canoe when they came down in the spring, which, lying dry, was leaky; so that we, being detained some hours, had a good deal of friendly conversation with the family; and eating dinner with them, we made them some small presents. Then putting our baggage in the canoe, some of them pushed slowly up the stream, and the rest of us rode our horses; and swimming them over a creek, called Lahawahamunk, we pitched our tent a little above it, being a shower in the evening: and in a sense of God's goodness in helping me in my distress, sustaining me under trials, and inclining my heart to trust in him, I lay down in an
<PB N="159" REF="013782_0173_0F91A66AEF1BC4C8"/>
humble bowed frame of mind, and had a comfortable night's lodging.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth day of the sixth month, we proceeded forward till the afternoon; when a storm appearing, we met our canoe at an appointed place; and the rain conti∣nuing, we stayed all night, which was so heavy, that it beat through our tent, and wet us and our baggage.</P>
<P>On the sixteenth day, we found, on our way, abundance of trees blown down with the storm yesterday; and had occasion reve∣rently to consider the kind dealings of the Lord, who provided a safe place for us in a valley, while this storm continued. By the falling of abundance of trees across our path, we were much hindered, and in some swamps our way was so stopped, that we got through with extream difficulty.</P>
<P>I had this day often to consider myself as a sojourner in this world; and a belief in the all-sufficiency of God to support his peo∣ple in their pilgrimage felt comfortable to me; and I was industriously employed to get to a state of perfect resignation.</P>
<P>We seldom saw our canoe but at appoint∣ed places, by reason of the path going off from the river: and this afternoon, Job Chi∣laway, an Indian from Wehaloosing, who talks good English, and is acquainted with several people in and about Philadelphia, met our people on the river; and understanding where we expected to lodge, pushed back about six miles, and came to us after night;

and in a while our own canoe came, it be∣ing hard work pushing up stream. Job told us, that an Indian came in haste to their town yesterday, and told them, that three warriors, coming from some distance, lodg∣ed in a town above Wehaloosing a few nights past; and that these three men were going against the English at Juniata. Job was going down the river to the province-store at Shamokin. Though I was so far favour∣ed with health as to continue travelling, yet through the various difficulties in our jour∣ney, and the different way of living from what I had been used to, I grew sick: and the news of these warriors being on their march so near us, and not knowing whe∣ther we might not fall in with them, was a fresh trial of my faith; and tho', thro' the strength of divine love, I had several times been enabled to commit myself to the divine disposal, I still found the want of my strength to be renewed, that I might persevere there∣in; and my cries for help were put up to the Lord, who, in great mercy, gave me a resigned heart, in which I found quietness.</P>
<P>On the seventeenth day, parting from Job Chilaway, we went on, and reached Weha∣loosing about the middle of the afternoon; and the first Indian that we saw, was a wo∣man of a modest countenance, with a Bible, who first spake to our guide; and then, with a harmonious voice, expressed her gladness at seeing us, having before heard of our coming: then, by the direction of our guide,
<PB N="161" REF="013782_0175_0F91A66F79EAACE8"/>
we sat down on a log; and he went to the town, to tell the people we were come. My companion and I sitting thus together, in a deep inward stillness, the poor woman came and sat near us; and great awfulness com∣ing over us, we rejoiced in a sense of God's love manifested to our poor souls. After a while, we heard a conkshell blow several times, and then came John Curtis, and another Indian man, who kindly invited us into a house near the town, where we found, I suppose, about sixty people sitting in si∣lence; and after sitting a short time, I stood up, and in some tenderness of spirit ac∣quainted them with the nature of my visit, and that a concern for their good had made me willing to come thus far to see them: all in a few short sentences, which some of them understanding, interpreted to the others, and there appeared gladness amongst them. Then I shewed them my certificate, which was explained to them; and the mo∣ravian, who overtook us on the way, being now here, bade me welcome.</P>
<P>On the eighteenth day, we rested ourselves this forenoon; and the Indians knowing that the moravian and I were of different reli∣gious societies, and as some of their people had encouraged him to come and stay a while with them, were, I believe, concerned, that no jarring or discord might be in their meetings: and they, I suppose, having con∣ferred together, acquainted me, that the people, at my request, would, at any time,
<PB N="162" REF="013782_0176_0F91A67033C07D48"/>
come together, and hold meetings; and al∣so told me, that they expected the moravian would speak in their settled meetings, which are commonly held morning and near even∣ing. So I found liberty in my heart to speak to the moravian, and told him of the care I felt on my mind for the good of these peo∣ple; and that I believed no ill effects would follow it, if I sometimes spake in their meet∣ings when love engaged me thereto, with∣out calling them together at times when they did not meet of course: whereupon he ex∣pressed his good-will toward my speaking at any time, all that I found in my heart to say: so near evening I was at their meet∣ing, where the pure gospel love was felt, to the tendering some of our hearts; and the interpreters endeavouring to acquaint the people with what I said, in short sentences, found some difficulty, as none of them were quite perfect in the English and Delaware tongues, so they helped one another, and we laboured along, divine love attending: and afterwards feeling my mind covered with the spirit of prayer, I told the interpreters that I found it in my heart to pray to God, and believed, if I prayed aright, he would hear me, and expressed my willingness for them to omit interpreting; so our meeting ended with a degree of divine love: and before the people went out, I observed Pa∣punehang (the man who had been zealous in labouring for a reformation in that town, being then very tender) spoke to one of the
<PB N="163" REF="013782_0177_0F91A67103E86590"/>
interpreters: and I was afterwards told that he said in substance as follows; "I love to feel where words come from."</P>
<P>On the nineteenth day, and first of the week, this morning in the meeting the In∣dian who came with the moravian, being al∣so a member of that society, prayed; and then the moravian spake a short time to the people: and in the afternoon, they coming together, and my heart being filled with a heavenly care for their good, I spake to them awhile by interpreters; but none of them being perfect in the work, and I feeling the current of love run strong, told the inter∣preters, that I believed some of the people would understand me, and so I proceeded: in which exercise, I believe the Holy Ghost wrought on some hearts to edification, where all the words were not understood. I look∣ed upon it as a time of divine favour, and my heart was tendered and truly thankful before the Lord; and after I sat down, one of the interpreters seemed spirited to give the Indians the substance of what I had said.</P>
<P>Before our first meeting this morning, I was led to meditate on the manifold diffi∣culties of these Indians, who, by the per∣mission of the Six Nations, dwell in these parts; and a near sympathy with them was raised in me; and my heart being enlarged in the love of Christ, I thought that the af∣fectionate care of a good man for his only brother in affliction, does not exceed what I then felt for that people.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="013782_0178_0F91A671AEE9C7E8"/>
I came to this place through much trou∣ble; and though, through the mercies of God, I believed, that if I died in the jour∣ney, it would be well with me; yet the thoughts of falling into the hands of Indian warriors, were, in times of weakness, afflict∣ing to me; and being of a tender constitu∣tion of body, the thoughts of captivity amongst them were, at times, grievous; as supposing, that they being strong and hardy, might demand service of me beyond what I could well bear; but the Lord alone was my keeper; and I believed, if I went into capti∣vity, it would be for some good end; and thus, from time to time, my mind was cen∣tered in resignation, in which I always found quietness. And now, this day, though I had the same dangerous wilderness between me and home, I was inwardly joyful that the Lord had strengthened me to come on this visit, and manifested a fatherly care over me in my poor lowly condition, when in mine own eyes I appeared inferior to many a∣mongst the Indians.</P>
<P>When the last mentioned meeting was ended, it being night Papunehang went to bed; and one of the interpreters sitting by me, I observed Papunehang spoke with an harmonious voice, I suppose, a minute or two: and asking the interpreter, was told, that "he was expressing his thankfulness to God for the favours he had received that day; and prayed that he would continue to favour him with that same, which he had
<PB N="165" REF="013782_0179_0F91A67293A07D88"/>
experienced in that meeting." That though Papunehang had before agreed to receive the moravian, and join with them, he still ap∣peared kind and loving to us.</P>
<P>On the twentieth day, I was at two meet∣ings, and silent in them.</P>
<P>The twenty-first day. This morning in meeting my heart was enlarged in pure love amongst them, and in short plain sentences expressed several things that rested upon me, which one of the interpreters gave the peo∣ple pretty readily; after which the meeting ended in supplication, and I had cause hum∣bly to acknowledge the loving-kindness of the Lord toward us; and then I believed that a door remained open for the faithful disciples of Jesus Christ, to labour amongst these people.</P>
<P>I now feeling my mind at liberty to re∣turn, took my leave of them in general, at the conclusion of what I said in meeting; and so we prepared to go homeward: but some of their most active men told us, that when we were ready to move, the people would choose to come and shake hands with us; which those who usually came to meet∣ing did: and from a secret draught in my mind, I went amongst some who did not use to go to meeting, and took my leave of them also: and the moravian and his Indian interpreter, appeared respectful to us at part∣ing. This town stands on the bank of Sus∣quehannah, and consists, I believe, of about forty houses, mostly compact together; some
<PB N="166" REF="013782_0180_0F91A677C64D24D8"/>
about thirty feet long, and eighteen wide, some bigger, some less; mostly built of split plank, one end set in the ground, and the other pinned to a plate, on which lay raf∣ters, and covered with bark. I understand a great flood last winter overflowed the chief part of the ground where the town stands; and some were now about moving their houses to higher ground.</P>
<P>We expected only two Indians to be our company; but when we were ready to go, we found many of them were going to Beth∣lehem with skins and furrs, who chose to go in company with us: so they loaded two canoes, which they desired us to go in, tell∣ing us, that the waters were so raised with the rains, that the horses should be taken by such who were better acquainted with the fording places: so we, with several Indians, went in the canoes, and others went on horses, there being seven besides ours. And we meeting with the horsemen once on the way by appointment, and then near night, a little below a branch called Tankhannah, we lodged there; and some of the young men going out a little before dusk with their guns, brought in a deer.</P>
<P>On the twenty-second day, through dili∣gence, we reached Wioming before night, and understood the Indians were mostly gone from this place: here we went up a small creek into the woods with our canoes, and, pitching our tent, carried out our baggage; and before dark our horses came to us.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="013782_0181_0F91A678DB5423B8"/>
On the twenty-third day in the morning their horses were loaded, and we prepared our baggage and so set forward, being in all fourteen; and with diligent travelling were favoured to get near half way to Fort-Allen. The land on this road from Wioming to our frontier being mostly poor, and good grass scarce, they chose a piece of low ground to lodge on, as the best for grasing; and I having sweat much in travelling, and be∣ing weary slept sound; I perceived in the night that I had taken cold, of which I was favoured to get better soon.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth day we passed Fort-Allen, and lodged near it in the woods.</P>
<P>Having forded the westerly branch of De∣laware three times, and thereby had a shorter way, and missed going over the top of the blue mountains, called the Second Ridge. In the second time fording, where the river cuts thro' the mountain, the waters being rapid and pretty deep, and my companion's mare being a tall tractable animal, he sundry times drove her back thro' the river, and they loaded her with the burthens of some small horses, which they thought not suffici∣ent to come thro' with their loads.</P>
<P>The troubles westward, and the difficulty for Indians to pass thro' our frontier, I ap∣prehend was one reason why so many came; as expecting that our being in company, would prevent the outside inhabitants from being surprized.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="013782_0182_0F91A67946A6E568"/>
On the twenty-fifth day we reached Beth∣lehem, taking care on the way to keep fore∣most, and to acquaint people on and near the road who these Indians were: this we found very needful; for the frontier inha∣bitants were often alarmed at the report of English being killed by Indians westward.</P>
<P>Amongst our company were some who I did not remember to have seen at meeting, and some of these at first were very reserved; but we being several days together, and be∣having friendly toward them, and making them suitable returns for the services they did us, they became more free and sociable.</P>
<P>On the twenty-sixth day and first of the week, having carefully endeavoured to settle all affairs with the Indians relative to our journey; we took leave of them, and I thought they generally parted with us af∣fectionately; so we getting to Richland, had a very comfortable meeting amongst our friends: here I parted with my kind friend and companion Benjamin Parvin; and ac∣companied by my friend Samuel Foulk, we rode to John Cadwallader's, from whence I reached home the next day, where I found my family middling well; and they and my friends all along appeared glad to see me re∣turn from a journey which they apprehend∣ed dangerous: but my mind, while I was out, had been so employed in striving for a perfect resignation, and I had so often been confirmed in a belief, that whatever the Lord might be pleased to allot for me, would
<PB N="169" REF="013782_0183_0F91A679F3EF70D0"/>
work for good: I was careful least I should admit any degree of selfishness in being glad overmuch, and laboured to improve by those trials in such a manner as my gracious Fa∣ther and protector intends for me. Between the English inhabitants and Wehaloosing, we had only a narrow path, which in many places is much grown up with bushes, and interrupted by abundance of trees lying across it, these, together with the moun∣tains, swamps, and rough stones, make it a difficult road to travel; and the more so, for that rattlesnakes abound there, of which we killed four: that people who have never been in such places, have but an imperfect idea of them; but I was not only taught pa∣tience, but also made thankful to God, who thus led me about and instructed me, that I might have a quick and lively feeling of the afflictions of my fellow-creatures, whose situation in life is difficult.</P>

friends exercising offices in civil govern∣ment.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE latter part of the summer, 1763, there came a man to Mount-Holly, who had before published, by a printed advertisement, that at a certain publick-house, he would shew many wonderful ope∣rations, which he therein enumerated.</P>
<P>This man, at the time appointed, did, by slight of hand, sundry things; which, to those gathered, appeared strange.</P>
<P>The next day, I hearing of it, and un∣derstanding that the shew was to be conti∣nued the next night, and the people to meet about sun-set, felt an exercise o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that ac∣count: so I went to the publick-house in the evening, and told the man of the house that I had an inclination to spend a part of the evening there; with which he signi∣fied that he was content. Then sitting down by the door, I spake to the people as they came together, concerning this shew; and more coming and sitting down with us, the seats at the door were mostly filled; and I had conversation with them in the fear of the Lord, and laboured to convince them that thus assembling to see those tricks or slights of hands, and bestowing their mo∣ney to support men who in that capacity were of no use in the world, was contrary to the nature of the christian religion.</P>
<P>There was one of the company who, for a time, endeavoured by arguments to shew
<PB N="172" REF="013782_0186_0F91A67C370DB060"/>
the reasonableness of their proceedings here∣in; but after considering some texts of scrip∣ture, and calmly debating the matter, he gave up the point. So having spent about an hour amongst them, and feeling my mind easy, I departed.</P>
<P>At our yearly-meeting at Philadelphia, on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, 1764, John Smith of Marlborough, aged upwards of eighty years, a faithful minister, tho' not eloquent, stood up in our meeting of ministers and elders, and appearing to be under a great exercise of spirit, informed friends in substance as follows: to wit, "That he had been a member of the society upward of sixty years, and well remembered that in those early times friends were a plain lowly-minded people; and that there was much tenderness and contrition in their meetings.—That at twenty years from that time, the society increasing in wealth, and in some degree conforming to the fashions of the world, true humility was less apparent, and their meetings in general not so lively and edifying—That at the end of forty years, many of them were grown very rich; that wearing of fine costly garments, and using of silver (and other) watches, became customary with them, their sons, and their daughters, and many of the society made a spacious appear∣ance in the world; which marks of outward wealth and greatness, appeared on some in our meetings of ministers and elders; and as these things became more prevalent, so
<PB N="173" REF="013782_0187_0F91A67CEF932F18"/>
the powerful overshadowings of the Holy Ghost were less manifest in the Society—That there had been a continued increase of these ways of life even until now; and that the weakness which hath now overspread the society, and the barrenness manifest amongst us, is matter of much sorrow." He then mentioned the uncertainty of his attending these meetings in future, expect∣ing his dissolution was now near; and hav∣ing tenderly expressed his concern for us, signified that he had seen in the true light that the Lord would bring back his people from these things into which they were thus degenerated, but that his faithful servants must first go thro' great and heavy exer∣cises therein.</P>
<P>On the twenty-ninth day, the committee appointed by the yearly-meeting to visit the quarterly and monthly meetings, now gave an account in writing of their proceed∣ings in that service; in which they signi∣fied, that in the course of it, they had been apprehensive that some persons holding of∣fices in government, inconsistent with our principles; and others who kept slaves, re∣maining active members in our meetings of discipline, had been one means of weakness more and more prevailing in the manage∣ment thereof in some places. After this re∣port was read, an exercise revived on my mind, which, at times, had attended me se∣veral years, and inward cries to the Lord were raised in me, that the fear of man
<PB N="174" REF="013782_0188_0F91A67FF1E1DA08"/>
might not prevent me from doing what he required of me; and standing up, I spake in substance as follows: "I have felt a ten∣derness in my mind toward persons, in two circumstances mentioned in that report; that is, toward such active members who keep slaves, and such who hold offices in ci∣vil government; and have desired, that friends in all their conduct may be kindly affectioned one toward another. Many friends, who keep slaves, are under some exercise on that account; and, at times, think about trying them with freedom; but find many things in their way: and the way of living, and annual expences of some of them are such, that it seems impractica∣ble for them to set their slaves free, without changing their own way of life. It has been my lot to be often abroad; and I have ob∣served in some places, at quarterly and year∣ly meetings, and at some houses where tra∣velling friends and their horses are often entertained, that the yearly expence of in∣dividuals therein is very considerable: and friends in some places crouding much on persons in these circumstances for entertain∣ment, hath often rested as a burthen on my mind for some years past; and I now ex∣press it in the fear of the Lord, greatly de∣siring that friends now present may duly consider it."</P>
<P>In the fall of this year, having hired a man to work, I perceived in conversation that he had been a soldier in the late war on
<PB N="175" REF="013782_0189_0F91A681E039A240"/>
this continent; and in the evening, giving a narrative of his captivity amongst the In∣dians, he informed me that he saw two of his fellow captives tortured to death in a very cruel manner.</P>
<P>This relation affected me with sadness, under which I went to bed; and the next morning, soon after I awoke, a fresh and living sense of divine love was spread over my mind; in which I had a renewed pro∣spect of the nature of that wisdom from above, which leads to a right use of all gifts, both spiritual and temporal, and gives con∣tent therein: under a feeling thereof, I wrote as follows:</P>
<P>"Hath He, who gave me a being attend∣ed with many wants unknown to brute-creatures, given me a capacity superior to theirs? and shewn me, that a moderate ap∣plication to business is proper to my present condition; and that this, attended with his blessing, may supply all outward wants, while they remain within the bounds he hath fixed; and no imaginary wants pro∣ceeding from an evil spirit, have any place in me? Attend then, O my soul! to this pure wisdom, as thy sure conductor thro' the manifold dangers in this world!"</P>
<P>"Doth pride lead to vanity? Doth vani∣ty form imaginary wants? Do these wants prompt men to exert their power in requir∣ing that of others, which themselves would rather be excused from, were the same re∣quired of them?"</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="013782_0190_0F91A68301070FC0"/>
"Do those proceedings beget hard thoughts? Do hard thoughts, when ripe, become malice? Does malice, when ripe, become revengeful; and in the end inflict terrible pains on their fellow-creatures, and spread desolations in the world?"</P>
<P>"Doth mankind, walking in uprightness, delight in each other's happiness? And do these creatures, capable of this attainment by giving way to an evil spirit, employ their wit and strength to afflict and destroy one another?"</P>
<P>"Remember then, O my soul! the quietude of those in whom Christ governs, and in all thy proceedings feel after it!"</P>
<P>"Doth he condescend to bless thee with his presence? To move and influence to action? To dwell in thee, and walk in thee? Remember then thy station, as a being sa∣cred to God; accept of the strength freely offered thee; and take heed that no weak∣ness, in conforming to expensive, unwise, and hard-hearted customs, gendering to dis∣cord and strife, be given way to. Doth he claim my body as his temple? And graci∣ously grant that I may be sacred to him. Oh! that I may prize this favour; and that my whole life may be conformable to this character!"</P>
<P>"Remember, O my soul! that the prince of peace is thy Lord: that he communicates his unmixed wisdom to his family; that they living in perfect simplicity, may give
<PB N="177" REF="013782_0191_0F91A684EC893308"/>
no just cause of offence to any creature, but may walk as he walked!"</P>
<P>Having felt an openness in my heart to∣ward visiting families in our own meeting, and especially in the town of Mount-Holly, the place of my abode, I mentioned it in our monthly-meeting the fore-part of the winter 1764; which being agreed to, and several friends of our meeting being united in the exercise, we proceeded therein; and through divine favour were helped in the work, so that it appeared to me as a fresh reviving of godly care amongst friends: and the latter part of the same winter, I joined my friend William Jones, in a visit to friends families in Mansfield; in which labour, I had cause to admire the goodness of the Lord toward us.</P>
<P>Having felt my mind drawn toward a visit to friends along the sea-coast from Cape May to near Squan; and also to visit some people in those parts, amongst whom there is no settled worship; I joined, with my be∣loved friend Benjamin Jones, in a visit there, having friends unity therein: and setting off the twenty-fourth day of the tenth month, 1765, we had a prosperous and very satis∣factory journey; feeling, at times, thro' the goodness of the heavenly Shepherd, the gos∣pel to flow freely toward a poor people scat∣tered in those places: and soon after our re∣turn, I joined my friends John Sleeper and Elizabeth Smith, in visiting friends families
<PB N="178" REF="013782_0192_0F91A68545EE47B0"/>
at Burlington, there being at this time about fifty families of our society in that city; and we had cause humbly to adore our heavenly Father, who baptized us in∣to a feeling of the state of the people, and strengthened us to labour in true gospel love amongst them.</P>
<P>An exercise having, at times, for several years, attended me, in regard to paying a religious visit to friends on the Eastern Shore of Maryland: such was the nature of this exercise, that I believed the Lord moved me to travel on foot amongst them, that by so travelling I might have a more lively feeling of the condition of the oppressed slaves, set an example of lowliness before the eyes of their masters, and be more out of the way of temptation to unprofitable converse.</P>
<P>The time now drawing near in which I believed it my duty to lay my concern be∣fore our monthly meeting, I perceived in conversation with my beloved friend John Sleeper, that he was under a concern to tra∣vel the same way, and also to travel on foot in the form of a servant amongst them, as he exprest it. This he told me before he knew aught of my exercise.</P>
<P>We being thus drawn the same way, laid our exercise and the nature of it before friends; and obtaining certificates, we set off the sixth day of the fifth month, 1766; and were at meetings with friends at Wil∣mington, Duck-Creek, Little-Creek and Mo∣therkill;
<PB N="179" REF="013782_0193_0F91A6862D5AE2B8"/>
my heart being sundry times ten∣dered under the divine influence, and en∣larged in love toward the people amongst whom we travelled.</P>
<P>From Motherkill, we crossed the country about thirty-five miles to friends at Tucka∣hoe in Maryland, and had a meeting there and at Marshy-Creek.</P>
<P>At these, our three last meetings, were a considerable number of people, followers of one Joseph Nichols, a preacher; who, I un∣derstand, is not in outward fellowship with any religious society of people, but profess∣eth nearly the same principles as our society doth, and often travels up and down ap∣pointing meetings, to which many people come. I heard some friends speaking of some of their neighbours, who had been irreligi∣ous people, that were now his followers, and were become sober well-behaved men and women.</P>
<P>Some irregularities, I hear, have been amongst the people at several of his meet∣ings; but from the whole of what I have perceived, I believe the man and some of his followers, are honestly disposed, but that skilful fathers are wanting among them: from hence we went to Choptank and Third Haven; and thence to Queen Ann's. The weather having some days past been hot and dry, and we to attend meetings pursuant to appointment, having travelled pretty steadily, and had hard labour in meetings, I grew
<PB N="180" REF="013782_0194_0F91A68821B4D090"/>
weakly; at which I was for a time discou∣raged; but looking over our journey, and thinking how the Lord had supported our minds and bodies, so that we got forward much faster than I expected before we came out, I now saw that I had been in danger of too strongly desiring to get soon through the journey, and that this bodily weakness now attending me was a kindness to me; and then, in contrition of spirit, I became very thankful to my gracious Father, for this ma∣nifestation of his love; and in humble sub∣mission to his will, my trust was renewed in him.</P>
<P>On this part of our journey, I had many thoughts on the different circumstances of friends who inhabit Pennsylvania and Jer∣sey, from those who dwell in Maryland, Vir∣ginia, and Carolina. Pennsylvania and New-Jersey were settled by many friends, who were convinced of our principles in England in times of sufferings, and coming over bought lands of the natives, and applied themselves to husbandry in a peaceable way; and many of their children were taught to labour for their living.</P>
<P>Few friends, I believe, came from Eng∣land to settle in any of these southern pro∣vinces; but by the faithful labours of tra∣velling friends in early times, there was con∣siderable convincements amongst the inhabi∣tants of these parts. Here I remembered my reading of the warlike disposition of many
<PB N="181" REF="013782_0195_0F91A6884985F918"/>
of the first settlers in those provinces, and of their numerous engagements with the na∣tives, in which much blood was shed, even in the infancy of those colonies. These peo∣ple, inhabiting those places, being grounded in customs contrary to the pure truth, when some of them were affected with the power∣ful preaching of the Word of Life, and joined in fellowship with our society, they had a great work to go through. It is ob∣servable in the History of the Reformation from Popery, that it had a gradual progress from age to age: the uprightness of the first reformers, in attending to the light and understanding given them, opened the way for sincere-hearted people to proceed further afterward; and thus each one truly fearing God, and labouring in those works of righte∣ousness appointed for them in their day, findeth acceptance with him: though, thro' the darkness of the times, and the corrup∣tion of manners and customs, some upright men may have had little more for their day's work than to attend to the righteous princi∣ple in their minds, as it related to their own conduct in life, without pointing out to others the whole extent of that, which the same principle would lead succeeding ages into. Thus for instance; amongst an impe∣rious warlike people, supported by oppressed slaves, some of these masters, I suppose, are awakened to feel and see their error; and, thro' sincere repentance, cease from oppres∣sion,
<PB N="182" REF="013782_0196_0F91A688F886CF58"/>
and become like fathers to their ser∣vants; shewing, by their example, a pat∣tern of humility in living, and moderation in governing, for the instruction and admo∣nition of their oppressing neighbours; those without carrying the reformation further, I believe have found acceptance with the Lord. Such was the beginning; and those who succeeded them, and have faithfully at∣tended to the nature and spirit of the re∣formation, have seen the necessity of pro∣ceeding forward; and not only to instruct others, by their example, in governing well, but also to use means to prevent their suc∣cessors from having so much power to op∣press others.</P>
<P>Here I was renewedly confirmed in my mind, that the Lord (whose tender mercies are over all his works, and whose ear is open to the cries and groans of the oppressed) is graciously moving on the hearts of people, to draw them off from the desire of wealth, and bring them into such an humble, lowly way of living, that they may see their way clearly, to repair to the standard of true righteousness; and not only break the yoke of oppression, but know him to be their strength and support in a time of outward affliction.</P>
<P>We passing on crossed Chester-River; and had a meeting there, and at Cecil and Sassa∣fras. Thro' my bodily weakness, joined with a heavy exercise of mind, it was to me an
<PB N="183" REF="013782_0197_0F91A689B703F430"/>
humbling dispensation, and I had a very lively feeling of the state of the oppressed; yet I often thought, that what I suffered was little, compared with the sufferings of the blessed Jesus, and many of his faithful fol∣lowers; and may say with thankfulness, I was made content.</P>
<P>From Sassafras we went pretty directly home, where we found our families well; and for several weeks after our return, I had often to look over our journey: and tho' to me it appeared as a small service, and that some faithful messengers will yet have more bitter cups to drink in those southern pro∣vinces for Christ's sake than we had; yet I found peace in that I had been helped to walk in sincerity, according to the under∣standing and strength given me.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth day of the eleventh month, 1766, with the unity of friends at our monthly-meeting, in company with my beloved friend Benjamin Jones, I sat out on a visit to friends in the upper part of this province, having had drawings of love in my heart that way a considerable time: we travelled as far as Hardwick; and I had in∣ward peace in my labours of love amongst them.</P>
<P>Thro' the humbling dispensations of Di∣vine Providence, my mind hath been brought into a further feeling of the difficulties of friends and their servants south-westward: and being often engaged in spirit on their
<PB N="184" REF="013782_0198_0F91B4DE9AF0D5D8"/>
account, I believed it my duty to walk into some parts of the western shore of Mary∣land, on a religious visit: and having ob∣tained a certificate from friends of our month∣ly-meeting, I took my leave of my family under the heart-tendering operation of truth; and on the twentieth day of the fourth month, 1767, I rode to the ferry opposite to Philadelphia, and from thence walked to William Horne's at Derby that evening; and next day pursued my journey alone, and reached Concord week-day meeting.</P>
<P>Discouragements and a weight of distress had at times, attended me in this lonesome walk; thro' which afflictions, I was merci∣fully preserved: and now sitting down with friends, my mind was turned toward the Lord, to wait for his holy leadings; who, in infinite love, was pleased to soften my heart into humble contrition, and did re∣newedly strengthen me to go forward; that to me it was a time of heavenly refreshment in a silent meeting.</P>
<P>The next day I came to New-Garden week-day meeting, in which I sat with bow∣edness of spirit; and being baptized into a feeling of the state of some present, the Lord gave us a heart-tendering season; to his name be the praise.</P>
<P>I passed on, and was at Nottingham month∣ly-meeting; and at a meeting at Little Bri∣tain on first-day: and in the afternoon se∣veral friends came to the house where I
<PB N="185" REF="013782_0199_0F91B4E1D47D77D8"/>
lodged, and we had a little afternoon-meet∣ing; and thro' the humbling power of truth, I had to admire the loving-kindness of the Lord manifested to us.</P>
<P>On the twenty-sixth day, I crossed Sus∣quehannah; and coming amongst people in outward ease and greatness, chiefly on the labour of slaves, my heart was much affect∣ed; and in awful retiredness, my mind was gathered inward to the Lord, being humbly engaged that in true resignation I might re∣ceive instruction from him, respecting my duty amongst this people.</P>
<P>Tho' travelling on foot was wearisome to my body; yet thus travelling, was agree∣able to the state of my mind.</P>
<P>I went gently on, being weakly; and was covered with sorrow and heaviness, on ac∣count of the spreading prevailing spirit of this world, introducing customs grievous and oppressive on one hand, and cherishing pride and wantonness on the other. In this lonely walk, and state of abasement and humilia∣tion, the state of the church in these parts was opened before me; and I may truly say with the prophet, <Q>I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.</Q> Under this exercise, I at∣tended the quarterly-meeting at Gunpow∣der; and, in bowedness of spirit, I had to open, with much plainness, what I felt re∣specting friends living in fullness, on the la∣bours of the poor oppressed negroes; and
<PB N="186" REF="013782_0200_0F91B4E3CC7938D8"/>
that promise of the Most High was now re∣vived: <Q>I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory.</Q>—Here the sufferings of Christ, and his tasting death for every man, and the travels, sufferings, and martyrdoms of the apostles, and primitive christians, in labour∣ing for the conversion of the gentiles, was livingly revived in me; and according to the measure of strength afforded, I laboured in some tenderness of spirit, being deeply af∣fected amongst them: and thus the differ∣ence between the present treatment which these gentiles the negroes receive at our hands, and the labours of the primitive christians for the conversion of the gentiles, was pressed home, and the power of truth came over us; under a feeling of which, my mind was united to a tender-hearted people in those parts; and the meeting con∣cluded in a sense of God's goodness toward his humble dependant children.</P>
<P>The next day was a general meeting for worship, much crouded; in which I was deeply engaged in inward cries to the Lord for help, that I might stand wholly resigned, and move only as he might be pleased to lead me: and I was mercifully helped to la∣bour honestly and fervently amongst them, in which I found inward peace; and the sin∣cere were comforted.</P>
<P>From hence I turned toward Pipe-Creek, and passed on to the Red-Lands; and had
<PB N="187" REF="013782_0201_0F91B4E3EAA6C708"/>
several meetings amongst friends in those parts. My heart was often tenderly affect∣ed, under a sense of the Lord's goodness, in sanctifying my troubles and exercises, turn∣ing them to my comfort, and, I believe, to the benefit of many others; for, I may say with thankfulness, that in this visit, it ap∣peared like a fresh tendering visitation in most places.</P>
<P>I passed on to the western quarterly-meet∣ing in Pennsylvania; during the several days of this meeting, I was mercifully preserved in an inward feeling after the mind of truth, and my publick labours tended to my humi∣liation, with which I was content: and after the quarterly-meeting of worship ended, I felt drawings to go to the women's meet∣ing of business; which was very full: and here the humility of Jesus Christ, as a pat∣tern for us to walk by, was livingly opened before me; and in treating on it, my heart was enlarged; and it was a baptizing time. From hence I went on; and was at meet∣ings at Concord, Middletown, Providence, and Haddonfield, and so home; where I found my family well. A sense of the Lord's merciful preservation in this my journey, ex∣cites reverent thankfulness to him.</P>
<P>On the second day of the ninth month, 1767, with the unity of friends, I set off on a visit to friends in the upper part of Berks and Philadelphia counties; was at eleven meetings in about two weeks; and
<PB N="188" REF="013782_0202_0F91B4E51E728288"/>
have renewed cause to bow in reverence be∣fore the Lord, who, by the powerful extend∣ings of his humbling goodness, opened my way amongst friends, and made the meet∣ings (I trust) profitable to us. And the win∣ter following, I joined friends on a visit to friends families, in some part of our meet∣ing; in which exercise, the pure influence of divine love, made our visits reviving.</P>
<P>On the fifth day of the fifth month, 1768, I left home, under the humbling hand of the Lord, having obtained a certificate, in order to visit some meetings in Maryland; and to proceed without a horse looked clear∣est to me. I was at the quarterly-meetings at Philadelphia and Concord; and then went on to Chester river; and crossing the Bay with friends, was at the yearly-meeting at West-River: thence back to Chester-River; and taking a few meetings in my way, pro∣ceeded home. It was a journey of much in∣ward waiting; and as my eye was to the Lord, way was, several times, opened to my humbling admiration, when things had ap∣peared very difficult.</P>
<P>In my return, I felt a relief of mind, very comfortable to me; having, thro' divine help, laboured in much plainness, both with friends selected, and in the more publick meetings: so that (I trust) the pure witness, in many minds, was reached.</P>
<P>The eleventh day of the sixth month, 1769. Sundry cases have happened of late
<PB N="189" REF="013782_0203_0F91B4E71A770258"/>
years, within the limits of our monthly-meeting, respecting that of exercising pure righteousness toward the negroes; in which I have lived under a labour of heart, that equity might be steadily kept to. On this account, I have had some close exercises amongst friends; in which, I may thank∣fully say, I find peace: and as my medita∣tions have been on universal love, my own conduct in time past, became of late very grievous to me.</P>
<P>As persons setting negroes free in our pro∣vince, are bound by law to maintain them, in case they have need of relief; some who scrupled keeping slaves for term of life, in the time of my youth, were wont to detain their young negroes in their service till thir∣ty years of age, without wages, on that ac∣count: and with this custom I so far agreed, that I, being joined to another friend, in executing the will of a deceased friend, once sold a negro lad till he might attain the age of thirty years, and applied the money to the use of the estate.</P>
<P>With abasement of heart, I may now say, that sometimes, as I have set in a meeting, with my heart exercised toward that awful Being, who respecteth not persons nor co∣lours, and have looked upon this lad, I have felt that all was not clear in my mind re∣specting him: and as I have attended to this exercise, and fervently sought the Lord, it hath appeared to me, that I should make
<PB N="190" REF="013782_0204_0F91B4E81192D338"/>
some restitution, but in what way I saw not till lately; when being under some concern, that I may be resigned to go on a visit to some part of the West-Indies; and was un∣der close engagement of spirit, seeking to the Lord for counsel herein: that of my joining in the sale aforesaid, came heavily upon me; and my mind, for a time, was covered with darkness and sorrow; and under this sore affliction, my heart was softened to receive instruction: and here I first saw, that as I had been one of the two executors, who had sold this lad nine years longer than is common for our own children to serve, so I should now offer a part of my substance to redeem the last half of that nine years; but as the time was not yet come, I executed a bond, binding me, and my executors, to pay to the man he was sold to, what to can∣did men might appear equitable, for the last four years and a half of his time, in case the said youth should be living, and in a condition likely to provide comfortably for himself.</P>
<P>The ninth day of the tenth month, 1769. My heart hath often been deeply afflicted under a feeling I have had, that the stand∣ard of pure righteousness, is not lifted up to the people by us, as a society, in that clear∣ness which it might have been, had we been so faithful to the teachings of Christ, as we ought to have been: and as my mind hath been inward to the Lord, the purity of
<PB N="191" REF="013782_0205_0F91B4E85B369550"/>
Christ's government hath been opened in my understanding; and under this exercise, that of friends being active in civil society, in putting laws in force which are not agree∣able to the purity of righteousness, hath, for several years, been an increasing bur∣then upon me; having felt, in the open∣ings of universal love, that where a people convinced of the truth of the inward teach∣ings of Christ, are active in putting laws in execution, which are not consistent with pure wisdom, it hath a necessary tendency to bring dimness over their minds: and as my heart hath been thus exercised, and a tender sympathy in me toward my fellow members, I have, within a few months past, in several meetings for discipline, expressed my con∣cern on this subject.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Under some bodily indisposition, his body, by abstinence, much weakened; and his mind, at that time, exercised for the good of the people in the West-Indies—His afterwards communicating to friends his being resigned to visit some of these islands—The state of his mind, and the close considerations he was led into, while under this exercise—His preparations to embark, and his considerations on the trade to these islands; and his being, when the vessel was ready to sail, released from the concern he had been under—His religious engagements after his return home—His sickness, in which he was brought to a very low state; and the prospects he then had.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE twelfth day of the third month, having, for some years past, dieted myself on account of a lump gathering on my nose; under this diet, I grew weak in body, and not of ability to travel by land as heretofore: I was, at times, favoured to look with awfulness toward the Lord, before whom are all my ways, who alone hath the power of life and death; and to feel thankful∣ness raised in me, for this his fatherly chastise∣ment, believing, if I was truly humbled un∣der
<PB N="193" REF="013782_0207_0F91B4E9EAA2FA60"/>
it, all would work for good. While I was under this bodily weakness, my mind being, at times, exercised for my fellow-creatures in the West-Indies, I grew jealous over myself, lest the disagreeableness of the prospect should hinder me from obediently attending thereto: for tho' I knew not that the Lord required me to go there; yet I be∣lieved, that resignation was now called for in that respect: and feeling a danger of not being wholly devoted to him, I was fre∣quently engaged to watch unto prayer, that I might be preserved; and upwards of a year having passed, I walked one day in a soli∣ry wood, my mind being covered with awful∣ness, cries were raised in me to my merciful Father, that he would graciously keep me in faithfulness; and it then settled on my mind as a duty, to open my condition to friends at our monthly-meeting; which I did soon after, as follows:</P>
<P>"An exercise hath attended me for some time past, and of late been more weighty upon me; under which, I believe it is re∣quired of me to be resigned to go on a visit to some part of the West-Indies:" and in the quarterly and general spring meeting, I found no clearness to express any thing fur∣ther, than that I believed resignation herein was required of me; and having obtained certificates from all said meetings, I felt like a sojourner at my outward habitation, kept free from worldly encumbrances, and was
<PB N="194" REF="013782_0208_0F91B4EBE7F33028"/>
often bowed in spirit before the Lord, with inward breathings to him, that I might be rightly directed. And I may here note, that what I have before related of my being, when young, joined as an executor with an∣other friend, in executing the will of the deceased, our having sold a negro lad till he might attain the age of thirty years, was now the occasion of great sorrow to me: and after having settled matters relating to this youth, I provided a sea-store and bed, and things for the voyage; and hearing of a vessel likely to sail from Philadelphia for Bar∣badoes, I spake with one of the owners at Burlington, and soon after went to Phila∣delphia on purpose to speak with him again: at which time he told me, there was a friend in town who was part owner of the said vessel; but I felt no inclination to speak with him, but returned home: and a while after, I took leave of my family; and going to Phi∣ladelphia, had some weighty conversation with the first-mentioned owner, and shewed him a writing, as follows:</P>
<P>"On the twenty-fifth day of the eleventh month, 1769, as an exercise, with respect to a visit to Barbadoes, hath been weighty on my mind, I may express some of the tryals which have attended me; under these tryals I have, at times, rejoiced, in that I have felt my own self-will subjected."</P>
<P>"I once, some years ago, retailed rum, sugar, and molasses, the fruits of the labour
<PB N="195" REF="013782_0209_0F91B4EC25EC3C98"/>
of slaves; but then, had not much concern about them, save only that the rum might be used in moderation; nor was this concern so weightily attended to, as I now believe it ought to have been: but of late years being further informed, respecting the oppressions too generally exercised in these islands, and thinking often on the degrees that are in connections of interest and fellowship with the works of darkness, Ephe. v. 11. And feeling an increasing concern to be wholly given up to the leadings of the Holy Spirit, it hath appeared, that the small gain I got by this branch of trade, should be applied in promoting righteousness on the earth; and were the first motion toward a visit to Bar∣badoes: I believed the outward substance I possess should be applied in paying my pas∣sage, if I go, and providing things in a low∣ly way for my subsistance; but when the time drew near, in which, I believed, it re∣quired of me to be in readiness, a difficulty arose, which hath been a continued tryal for some months past; under which, I have, with abasement of mind, from day to day, sought the Lord for instruction; and often had a feeling of the condition of one for∣merly, who bewailed himself, for that the Lord hid his face from him.—During these exercises, my heart hath been often contrite; and I have had a tender feeling of the temp∣tations of my fellow-creatures, labouring un∣der those expensive customs distinguishable
<PB N="196" REF="013782_0210_0F91B4ECE49F3E80"/>
from the simplicity that there is in Christ, 2 Cor. ii. 3. and sometimes in the renewings of gospel love, have been helped to minister to others."</P>
<P>"That which hath so closely engaged my mind, in seeking to the Lord for instruction is, whether, after so full information of the oppression the slaves in the West-Indies lie under, who raise the West-India produce, as I had in reading a caution and warning to Great-Britain and her colonies, wrote by Anthony Benezet) it is right for me to take a passage in a vessel, employed in the West-India trade?"</P>
<P>"To trade freely with oppressors, and with∣out labouring to dissuade from such unkind treatment, seek for gain by such traffick, tends, I believe, to make them more easy, respecting their conduct, than they would be, if the cause of universal righteousness was humbly and firmly attended to, by those in general with whom they have commerce; and that complaint of the Lord by his pro∣phet, <Q>They have strengthened the hands of the wicked,</Q> hath very often revived in my mind; and I may here add some cir∣cumstances preceding any prospect of a vi∣sit there: the case of David hath often been before me of late years: he longed for some water in a well beyond an army of Philis∣tines, at war with Israel; and some of his men, to please him, ventured their lives in passing thro' this army, and brought that water."</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="013782_0211_0F91B4EDAF20E930"/>
"It doth not appear that the Israelites were then scarce of water, but rather, that Da∣vid gave way to delicacy of taste; but hav∣ing thought on the danger these men were exposed to, he considered this water as their blood, and his heart smote him that he could not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord. And the oppression of the slaves, which I have seen in several journies southward, on this continent, and the report of their treat∣ment in the West-Indies hath deeply affect∣ed me; and a care to live in the spirit of peace, and minister just cause of offence to none of my fellow-creatures, hath, from time to time, livingly revived on my mind; and under this exercise, I, for some years past, declined to gratify my palate with those sugars."</P>
<P>"I do not censure my brethren in these things; but believe the Father of mercies, to whom all mankind by creation are equal∣ly related, hath heard the groans of these oppressed people; and is preparing soon to have a tender feeling of their condition: and the trading in, or frequent use of, any pro∣duce known to be raised by the labours of those who are under such lamentable oppres∣sion, hath appeared to be a subject which may yet more require the serious considera∣tion of the humble followers of Christ, the prince of peace."</P>
<P>"After long and mournful exercise, I am now free to mention how things have open∣ed
<PB N="198" REF="013782_0212_0F91B4EE6BB08648"/>
in my mind, with desires that if it may please the Lord, to further open his will to any of his children in this matter, they may faithfully follow him in such further mani∣festation."</P>
<P>"The number of those who decline the use of the West-India produce, on account of the hard usage of the slaves who raise it, ap∣pears small, even amongst people truly pi∣ous; and the labours in christian love, on that subject, of those who do, not very ex∣tensive."</P>
<P>"Were the trade from this continent to the West-Indies to be quite stopped at once, I believe many there would suffer for want of bread."</P>
<P>"Did we on this continent, and the in∣habitants of the West-Indies, generally dwell in pure righteousness, I believe a small trade between us might be right: that under these considerations, when the thoughts of wholly declining the use of trading vessels, and of trying to hire a vessel to go under ballast have arose in my mind, I have believed that the labours in gospel love, yet bestowed in the cause of universal righteousness, are not arrived to that height."</P>
<P>"If the trade to the West-Indies were no more than was consistent with pure wisdom, I believe the passage-money would, for good reasons, be higher than it is now; and here, under deep exercise of mind, I have believed, that I should not take the advantage of this great trade, and small passage-money; but
<PB N="199" REF="013782_0213_0F91B4EF1CD9F0C8"/>
as a testimony in favour of less trading, should pay more than is common for others to pay, if I go at this time."</P>
<P>The first-mentioned owner having read the paper, expressed a willingness to go with me to the other owner; and we going, the said other owner read over the paper, and we had some solid conversation; under which, I felt my soul bowed in reverence before the Most-High: and, at length, one of them asked me, if I would go and see the vessel? but I had not clearness in my mind to go; but went to my lodgings, and re∣tired in private.</P>
<P>I was now under great exercise of mind; and my tears were poured out before the Lord, with inward cries, that he would gra∣ciously help me under these trials.</P>
<P>In this case, I believe my mind was re∣signed, but did not feel clearness to pro∣ceed; and my own weakness, and the neces∣sity of divine instruction, was impressed up∣on me.</P>
<P>I was, for a time, as one who knew not what to do, and was tossed as in a tempest; under which affliction, the doctrine of Christ "Take no thought for the morrow," arose livingly before me. I remembered it was some days before they expected the vessel to sail, and was favoured to get into a good degree of stillness; and having been near two days in town, I believe my obedience to my heavenly Father consisted in returning
<PB N="200" REF="013782_0214_0F91B4F076E1C248"/>
homeward; and then I went over amongst friends on the Jersey shore, and tarried till the morning on which they had appointed to sail: and as I lay in bed the latter part of that night, my mind was comforted; and I felt what I esteemed a fresh confirmation, that it was the Lord's will, that I should pass through some further exercises near home.</P>
<P>So I went home, and still felt like a so∣journer with my family: and in the fresh spring of pure love, had some labours in a private way amongst friends, on a subject relating to truth's testimony; under which, I had frequently been exercised in heart for some years. I remember, as I walked on the road under this exercise, that passage in Eze∣kiel came fresh before me: <Q>Whithersoever their faces were turned, thither they went.</Q> and I was graciously helped to discharge my duty, in the fear and dread of the Al∣mighty.</P>
<P>After a few weeks, it pleased the Lord to visit me with a pleurisy; and after I had lain a few days, and felt the disorder very grievous, I was thoughtful how it might end.</P>
<P>I had of late, through various exercises, been much weaned from the pleasant things of this life; and I now thought, if it was the Lord's will to put an end to my labours, and graciously receive me into the arms of his mercy, death would be acceptable to me;
<PB N="201" REF="013782_0215_0F91B4F2A67FCDF0"/>
but if it was his will to farther refine me under affliction, and make me, in any de∣gree, useful in his church, I desired not to die. I may, with thankfulness, say, that in this case I felt resignedness wrought in me, and had no inclination to send for a doctor; believing, if it was the Lord's will, thro' outward means, to raise me up, some sympathizing friends would be sent to mini∣ster to me; which were accordingly: but though I was carefully attended, yet the dis∣order was, at times, so heavy, that I had no thoughts of recovery: one night in par∣ticular, my bodily distress was great; my feet grew cold, and cold increased up my legs toward my body; and, at that time, I had no inclination to ask my nurse to apply any∣thing warm to my feet, expecting my end was near: and after I had lain near ten hours in this condition, I closed my eyes, thinking whether I might now be delivered out of the body; but in these awful moments, my mind was livingly opened to behold the church; and strong engagements were be∣gotten in me, for the everlasting well-being of my fellow-creatures: and I felt, in the spring of pure love, that I might remain some time longer in the body, in filling up, according to my measure, that which re∣mains of the affections of Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and in la∣bouring for the good of the church; after which, I requested my nurse to apply warmth to my feet; and I revived: and the next
<PB N="202" REF="013782_0216_0F91B4F344839808"/>
night, feeling a weighty exercise of spirit, and having a solid friend sitting up with me, I requested him to write what I said; which he did, as follows:</P>
<P>"Fourth day of the first month, 1770, about five in the morning.—I have seen in the Light of the Lord, that the day is ap∣proaching, when the man that is the most wise in human policy, shall be the greatest fool; and the arm that is mighty to support injustice, shall be broken to pieces: the ene∣mies of righteousness shall make a terrible rattle, and shall mightily torment one ano∣ther; for He that is omnipotent is rising up to judgment, and will plead the cause of the oppressed; and he commanded me to open the vision."</P>
<P>Near a week after this, feeling my mind livingly opened, I sent for a neighbour, who, at my request, wrote as follows:</P>
<P>"The place of prayer is a precious habi∣tation; for I now saw that the prayers of the saints was precious incense: and a trum∣pet was given me, that I might sound forth this language; that the children might hear it, and be invited together to this precious habitation, where the prayers of the saints, as precious incense, ariseth up before the throne of God and the Lamb—I saw this habitation to be safe; to be inwardly quiet, when there were great stirrings and commo∣tions in the world."</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="013782_0217_0F91B4F538ADA0D8"/>
"Prayer, at this day, in pure resignation, is a precious place: the trumpet is sounded, the call goes forth to the church, that she gather to the place of pure inward prayer; and her habitation is safe."</P>

<P>In the fourth month following, I thought the time was come for me to make some en∣quiry for a suitable conveyance; being ap∣prehensive, that as my concern was princi∣pally toward the northern parts of England, it would be most proper to go in a vessel bound to Liverpool or Whitehaven: and while I was at Philadelphia, deliberating on this occasion, I was informed, that my belov∣ed friend Samuel Emlen, jun. intending to go to London; and having taken a passage for himself in the cabbin of the ship, called Mary and Elizabeth, of which James Sparks was master, and John Head, of the city of Philadelphia, one of the owners; and I feel∣ing a draft in my mind toward the steerage of the same ship, went first and opened to Samuel the feeling I had concerning it.</P>
<P>My beloved friend wept when I spake to him, and appeared glad that I had thoughts
<PB N="205" REF="013782_0219_0F91B4F74F600518"/>
of going in the vessel with him, though my prospect was toward the steerage; and he offering to go with me, we went on board, first into the cabbin, a commodious room, and then into the steerage; where we sat down on a chest, the sailors being busy about us: then the owner of the ship came, and sat down with us.</P>
<P>Here my mind was turned toward Christ, the heavenly counsellor; and I feeling, at this time, my own will subjected, my heart was contrite before him.</P>
<P>A motion was made by the owner, to go and set in the cabbin, as a place more re∣tired; but I felt easy to leave the ship, and made no agreement as to a passage in her; but told the owner, if I took a passage in the ship, I believed it would be in the steerage; but did not say much as to my exercise in that case.</P>
<P>After I went to my lodgings, and the case was a little known in town, a friend laid be∣fore me the great inconvenience attending a passage in the steerage; which, for a time, appeared very discouraging to me.</P>
<P>I soon after went to bed, and my mind was under a deep exercise before the Lord; whose helping hand was manifested to me as I slept that night, and his love strengthen∣ed my heart: and in the morning, I went with two friends on board the vessel again; and after a short time spent therein, I went with Samuel Emlen to the house of the
<PB N="206" REF="013782_0220_0F91B4F76C471158"/>
owner; to whom, in the hearing of Samuel only, I opened my exercise, in substance as follows, in relation to a scruple I felt with regard to a passage in the cabbin:</P>
<P>I told the owner, that on the outside of that part of the ship where the cabbin was, I observed sundry sorts of carved work and imagery; and that in the cabbin I observed some superfluity of workmanship of several sorts; and that according to the ways of men's reckoning, the sum of money to be paid for a passage in that apartment, hath some relation to the expence in furnishing it to please the minds of such who give way to a conformity to this world; and that in this case, as in other cases, the monies received from the passengers, are calculated to answer every expence relating to their passage, and amongst the rest of these superfluities: and that in this case, I felt a scruple with regard to paying my money to defray such ex∣pences.</P>
<P>As my mind was now opened, I told the owner, that I had, at several times in my travels, seen great oppressions on this conti∣nent; at which my heart had been much affected, and brought into a feeling of the state of the sufferers. And having many times been engaged, in the fear and love of God, to labour with those under whom the oppressed have been borne down and afflict∣ed; I have often perceived, that a view to get riches, and provide estates for children,
<PB N="207" REF="013782_0221_0F91B4F881D786F0"/>
to live conformable to customs, which stand in that spirit wherein men have regard to the honours of this world—that in the pur∣suit of these things, I had seen many entan∣gled in the spirit of oppression; and the ex∣ercise of my soul had been such, that I could not find peace, in joining in any thing which I saw was against that wisdom which is pure.</P>
<P>After this, I agreed for a passage in the steerage; and hearing in town that Joseph White had a desire to see me, I felt the re∣viving of a desire to see him, and went then to his house, and next day home; where I tarried two nights: and then early in the morning, I parted with my family, under a sense of the humbling hand of God upon me; and going to Philadelphia, had oppor∣tunity with several of my beloved friends; who appeared to be concerned for me, on account of the unpleasant situation of that part of the vessel, where I was likely to lodge.</P>
<P>In these opportunities, my mind, through the mercies of the Lord, was kept low, in an inward waiting for his help; and friends having expressed their desire, that I might have a place more convenient than the steer∣age, did not urge, but appeared disposed to leave me to the Lord.</P>
<P>Having stayed two nights in Philadelphia, I went the next day to Derby monthly-meet∣ing; where, through the strength of divine
<PB N="208" REF="013782_0222_0F91B4F8DD1822A8"/>
love, my heart was enlarged toward the youth then present; under which I was helped to labour in some tenderness of spi∣rit. Then lodging at William Horne's, I, with one friend, went to Chester; where meeting with Samuel Emlen, we went on board the first day of the fifth month, 1772: and as I sat down alone, on a seat on the deck, I felt a satisfactory evidence, that my proceedings were not in my own will, but under the power of the cross of Christ.</P>
<P>Seventh day of the fifth month: have had rough weather, mostly since I came on board; and the passengers, James Reynolds, John Till-Adams, Sarah Logan and her hired maid, and John Bispham, all sea-sick, more or less, at times; from which sickness, thro' the tender mercies of my heavenly Fa∣ther, I have been preserved: my afflictions now being of another kind.</P>
<P>There appeared an openness in the minds of the master of the ship and in the cabbin passengers toward me; we were often toge∣ther on the deck, and sometimes in the cab∣bin.</P>
<P>My mind, thro' the merciful help of the Lord, hath been preserved in a good degree watchful, and inward; and have, this day, great cause to be thankful, in that I remain to feel quietness of mind.</P>
<P>As my lodgings in the steerage, now near a week, hath afforded me sundry opportu∣nities of seeing, hearing, and feeling, with
<PB N="209" REF="013782_0223_0F91B4F9CD43DFC0"/>
respect to the life and spirit of many poor sailors: an inward exercise of soul hath at∣tended me, in regard to placing out children and youth where they may be likely to be exampled and instructed in the pure fear of the Lord; and I being much amongst the seamen, have from a motion of love, sundry times taken opportunities, with one of them at a time alone; and in a free conversation, laboured to turn their minds toward the fear of the Lord: and this day we had a meet∣ing in the cabbin, where my heart was con∣trite under a feeling of divine love.</P>
<P>Now concerning lads being trained up as seamen: I believe a communication from one part of the world to some other parts of it, by sea, is, at times, consistent with the will of our heavenly Father; and to educate some youth in the practice of sailing, I believe may be right: but how lamentable is the present corruption of the world! how im∣pure are the channels thro' which trade hath a conveyance! how great is that danger, to which poor lads are now exposed, when placed on shipboard to learn the art of sail∣ing?</P>
<P>Five lads, training up for the seas, were now on board this ship; two of them brought up amongst our society; one of which hath a right amongst friends, by name James Nailor, to whose father James Nailor, men∣tioned in Sewel's history, appears to have been uncle.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="013782_0224_0F91B4FA5C25BBF8"/>
I often feel a tenderness of heart toward these poor lads; and, at times, look at them as though they were my children according to the flesh.</P>
<P>O that all may take heed and beware of covetousness! O that all may learn of Christ, who was meek and low of heart! Then in faithfully following him, he will teach us to be content with food and raiment, without re∣spect to the customs or honours of this world.</P>
<P>Men thus redeemed, will feel a tender con∣cern for their fellow-creatures, and a desire that those in the lowest stations may be assist∣ed and encouraged; and where owners of ships attain to the perfect law of liberty, and are doers of the word, these will be blessed in their deeds.</P>
<P>A ship at sea commonly sails all night, and the seamen take their watches four hours at a time.</P>
<P>Rising to work in the night, is not com∣monly pleasant in any case; but in dark rainy nights it is very disagreeable, even though each man were furnished with all conveniences: but if men must go out at midnight to help manage the ship in the rain, and having small room to sleep and lay their garments in, are often beset to furnish themselves for the watch; their garments or some thing relating to their business being wanting, and not easily found; when from the urgency occasioned by high winds, they are hastened and called up suddenly: here is a
<PB N="211" REF="013782_0225_0F91B4FB1DF4BF38"/>
tryal of patience on the poor sailors, and the poor lads their companions.</P>
<P>If after they have been on deck several hours in the night, and come down into the steerage soaking wet, and are so close stowed that proper convenience for change of gar∣ment is not easily come at, but for want of proper room their wet garments thrown in heaps, and sometimes, through much crowd∣ing, are trodden under foot, in going to their lodgings and getting out of them, and great difficulties, at times, each one to find his own: here are tryals on the poor sailors.</P>
<P>Now as I have been with them in my lodge, my heart hath often yearned for them; and tender desires been raised in me, that all owners and masters of vessels may dwell in the love of God, and therein act uprightly; and by seeking less for gain, and looking carefully to their ways, may earn∣estly labour to remove all cause of provoca∣tion from the poor seamen, either to fret or use excess of strong drink; for, indeed, the poor creatures, at times, in the wet and cold, seem to apply to strong drink to sup∣ply the want of other convenience.</P>
<P>Great reformation in the world is want∣ing, and the necessity of it, amongst these who do business on great waters, hath, at this time, been abundantly opened before me.</P>
<P>The eighth day of the fifth month.—This morning the clouds gathered, the wind blew
<PB N="212" REF="013782_0226_0F91B4FBE73FC678"/>
strong from south-eastward, and before noon increased to that degree that sailing appeared dangerous: the seamen then bound up some of their sails, and took down some; and the storm increasing, they put the dead lights, so called, into the cabbin-windows, and lighted a lamp as at night.</P>
<P>The wind now blew vehemently, and the sea wrought to that degree, that an awful se∣riousness prevailed in the cabbin, in which I spent, I believe, about seventeen hours; for I believed the poor wet toiling seamen, had need of all the room in the crouded steerage, and the cabbin passengers had given me frequent invitations.</P>
<P>They ceased now from sailing; and put the vessel in the posture, called lying-to.</P>
<P>My mind in this tempest, thro' the gra∣cious assistance of the Lord, was preserved in a good degree of resignation; and I felt, at times, a few words in his love to my ship-mates, in regard to the all-sufficiency of Him who formed the great deep, and whose care is so extensive, that a sparrow falls not without his notice: and thus in a tender frame of mind, spake to them of the necessity of our yielding, in true obedience, to the instructions of our heavenly Father, who sometimes, through adversities, intend∣eth our refinement.</P>
<P>About eleven at night, I went out on the deck, when the sea wrought exceedingly, and the high foaming waves, all round about,
<PB N="213" REF="013782_0227_0F91B4FCA5CC9AF0"/>
had in some sort the appearance of fire; but did not give much, if any, light.</P>
<P>The sailor, then at the helm, said, he lately saw a corposant at the head of the mast.</P>
<P>About this time I observed the master of the ship ordered the carpenter to keep on the deck; and tho' he said little, I apprehended his care was, that the carpenter with his axe might be in readiness, in case of any extre∣mity.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the vehemency of the wind abated; and before morning, they again put the ship under sail.</P>
<P>The tenth day of the month, and first of the week, it being fine weather, we had a meeting in the cabbin, at which most of the seamen were present: this meeting to me was a strengthening time.</P>
<P>The thirteenth day of the month. As I continue to lodge in the steerage, I feel an openness this morning, to express something further of the state of my mind, in respect to poor lads bound apprentice to learn the art of sailing. As I believe sailing is of some use in the world, a labour of soul attends me, that the pure counsel of truth may be humbly waited for in this case, by all concerned in the business of the seas.</P>
<P>A pious father, whose mind is exercised for the everlasting welfare of his child, may not, with a peaceable mind, place him out to an employment amongst a people, whose
<PB N="214" REF="013782_0228_0F91B4FD6504A388"/>
common course of life is manifestly corrupt and prophane; so great is the present defect amongst sea-faring men, in regard to piety and virtue: and through an abundant traf∣fick, and many ships of war, so many peo∣ple are employed on the sea, that this subject of placing lads to the employment appears very weighty.</P>
<P>Prophane examples are very corrupting, and very forcible. And as my mind, day after day, and night after night, hath been affected with a sympathizing tenderness to∣ward poor children, put to the employment of sailors, I have sometimes had weighty conversation with the sailors in the steerage, who were mostly respectful to me, and more and more so the longer I was with them: they mostly appeared to take kindly what I said to them; but their minds have appeared to be so deeply impressed with that almost universal depravity amongst sailors, that the poor creatures in their answers to me on this subject, have revived in my remem∣brance, that of the degenerate Jews a little before the captivity, as repeated by Jeremiah the prophet, "There is no hope."</P>
<P>Now under this exercise, a sense of the desire of outward gain prevailing amongst us, hath felt grievous; and a strong call to the professed followers of Christ, hath been raised in me; that, all may take heed, lest, through loving this present world, they be found in a continued neglect of duty, with
<PB N="215" REF="013782_0229_0F91B4FE275B7C38"/>
respect to a faithful labour for a reforma∣tion.</P>
<P>Silence, as to every motion proceeding from the love of money, and an humble waiting upon God, to know his will con∣cerning us, hath now appeared necessary: he alone is able to strengthen us to dig deep, to remove all which lies between us and the safe foundation, and so direct us in our out∣ward employments, that pure universal love may shine forth in our proceedings.</P>
<P>Desires arising from the spirit of truth, are pure desires; and when a mind, divinely opened toward a young generation, is made sensible of corrupting examples, powerfully working, and extensively spreading amongst them, how moving is the prospect!</P>
<P>A great trade to the coast of Africa for slaves; of which I now heard frequent con∣versation among the sailors!</P>
<P>A great trade in that which is raised and prepared thro' grievous oppression!</P>
<P>A great trade in superfluity of workman∣ship, formed to please the pride and vanity of people's minds!</P>
<P>Great and extensive is that depravity, which prevails amongst the poor sailors!</P>
<P>When I remember that saying of the Most High, through his prophet, <Q>This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise:</Q> and think of placing children amongst them, to learn the practice of sailing, the consistency of it with a pious
<PB N="216" REF="013782_0230_0F91B4FEE7D30D98"/>
education, seems to me like that mentioned by the prophet, <Q>There is no answer from God.</Q></P>
<P>In a world of dangers and difficulties, like a desolate thorny wilderness, how precious! how comfortable! how safe! are the lead∣ings of Christ, the good shepherd; who said, "I know my sheep; and am known of mine."</P>
<P>The sixteenth day of the month. Wind for several days past often high, what the sailors call squally, rough sea and frequent rains. This last night a very trying night to the poor seamen; the water, chief part of the night, running over the main deck, and sometimes breaking waves came on the quar∣ter deck. The latter part of the night, as I lay in bed, my mind was humbled under the power of divine love; and resignedness to the great Creator of the earth and the seas, renewedly wrought in me, whose fa∣therly care over his children felt precious to my soul: and desires were now renewed in me, to embrace every opportunity of being inwardly acquainted with the hardships and difficulties of my fellow-creatures, and to labour in his love for the spreading of pure universal righteousness on the earth. The opportunities being frequent of hearing con∣versation amongst the sailors, in respect to the voyages to Africa, and the manner of bringing the deeply oppressed slaves into our islands. The thoughts of their condition, frequently in chains and setters on board the
<PB N="217" REF="013782_0231_0F91B4FFAB142320"/>
vessels, with hearts loaded with grief, under the apprehensions of miserable slavery; my mind was frequently opened to meditate on these things.</P>
<P>On the seventeenth day of the month, and first of the week, we had a meeting in the cabbin; to which the seamen generally came. My spirit was contrite before the Lord; whose love, at this time, affected my heart.</P>
<P>This afternoon I felt a tender sympathy of soul, with my poor wife and family left be∣hind; in which state, my heart was en∣larged in desires, that they may walk in that humble obedience wherein the everlasting Father may be their guide and support, thro' all the difficulties in this world; and a sense of that gracious assistance, thro' which my mind hath been strengthened to take up the cross and leave them, to travel in the love of truth, hath begotten thankfulness in my heart to our great Helper.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth day of the month, and first of the week, a clear pleasant morn∣ing: and as I sat on deck, I felt a reviving in my nature; which, through much rainy weather, and high winds, being shut up in a close unhealthy air, was weakened.</P>
<P>Several nights of late I felt breathing dif∣ficult; that a little after the rising of the second watch (which is about midnight) I got up, and stood, I believe, near an hour, with my face near the hatchway, to get the fresh air at the small vacancy under the
<PB N="218" REF="013782_0232_0F91B501A3058F98"/>
hatch door; which is commonly shut down, partly to keep out rain, and sometimes to keep the breaking waves from dashing into the steerage.</P>
<P>I may, with thankfulness to the Father of mercies, acknowledge, that in my pre∣sent weak state, my mind hath been support∣ed to bear the affliction with patience; and have looked at the present dispensation as a kindness from the great Father of mankind, who, in this my floating pilgrimage, is in some degree bringing me to feel that, which many thousands of my fellow-creatures of∣ten suffer in a greater degree.</P>
<P>My appetite failing, the tryal hath been the heavier; and I have felt tender breath∣ings in my soul after God, the fountain of comfort, whose inward help hath supplied, at times, the want of outward convenience: and strong desires have attended me, that his family, who are acquainted with the mov∣ings of his Holy Spirit, may be so redeemed from the love of money, and from that spi∣rit in which men seek honour one of ano∣ther; that in all business, by sea or land, we may constantly keep in view the coming of his kingdom on earth, as it is in heaven; and by faithfully following this safe guide, shew forth examples, tending to lead out of that under which the creation groans!</P>
<P>This day we had a meeting in the cabbin; in which I was favoured in some degree to experience the fulfilling of that saying of
<PB N="219" REF="013782_0233_0F91B501DB403DF8"/>
the prophet, <Q>The Lord hath been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in their distress;</Q> for which, my heart is bowed in thankfulness before him.</P>
<P>The twenty-eighth day of the month: wet weather of late, small winds inclining to calms; our seamen have cast a lead, I sup∣pose about one hundred fathom, but find no bottom: foggy weather this morning.</P>
<P>Through the kindness of the great Pre∣server of men, my mind remains quiet; and a degree of exercise, from day to day, at∣tends me, that the pure peaceable govern∣ment of Christ may spread and prevail a∣mongst mankind.</P>
<P>The leading on of a young generation, in that pure way, in which the wisdom of this world hath no place: where parents and tu∣tors, humbly waiting for the heavenly Coun∣sellor, may example them in the truth, as it is in Jesus. This, for several days, hath been the exercise of my mind; O how safe, how quiet is that state, where the soul stands in pure obedience to the voice of Christ, and a watchful care is maintained, not to follow the voice of the stranger!</P>
<P>Here Christ is felt to be our shepherd; and under his leading, people are brought to a stability: and where he doth not lead for∣ward, we are bound in the bonds of pure love, to stand still and wait upon him. In the love of money, and in the wisdom of this world, business is proposed, then the
<PB N="220" REF="013782_0234_0F91B502F4BA3AE0"/>
urgency of affairs push forward; nor can the mind, in this state, discern the good and per∣fect will of God concerning us.</P>
<P>The love of God is manifested, in graci∣ously calling us to come out of that which stands in confusion; but if we bow not in the name of Jesus; if we give not up those prospects of gain, which, in the wisdom of this world, are open before us, but say in our hearts, I must needs go on; and in go∣ing on, I hope to keep as near to the purity of truth, as the business before me will ad∣mit of: here the mind remains entangled, and the shining of the light of life into the soul is obstructed.</P>
<P>This query opens in my mind in the love of Christ. Where shall a pious father place his son apprentice, to be instructed in the practice of crossing the seas; and have faith to believe, that Christ, our holy Shepherd, leads him to place his son there?</P>
<P>Surely the Lord calls to mourning and deep humiliation, that in his fear we may be instructed, and led safely on through the great difficulties and perplexities in this pre∣sent age.</P>
<P>In an entire subjection of our wills, the Lord graciously opens a way for his people, where all their wants are bounded by his wisdom; and here we experience the sub∣stance of what Moses the prophet figured out in the water of separation, as a purification from sin.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="013782_0235_0F91B5036F2C2C00"/>
Esau is mentioned as a child red all over, like a hairy garment: in Esau is represented the natural will of man. In preparing the water of separation, a red heifer without blemish, on which there had been no yoke, was to be slain, and her blood sprinkled by the priest seven times toward the tabernacle of the congregation: then her skin, her flesh, and all pertaining to her, was to be burnt without the camp; and of her ashes the water was prepared. Thus the crucify∣ing the old man, or natural will, is repre∣sented; and hence comes a separation from that carnal mind, which is death.</P>
<P><Q>He who toucheth the dead body of a man, and purisieth not himself with the water of separation, he defileth the taber∣nacle of the Lord; he is unclean.</Q> Numb. xix. 13.</P>
<P>If any, through the love of gain, go forth into business, wherein they dwell as a∣mongst the tombs, and touch the bodies of those who are dead: if these, through the infinite love of God, feel the power of the cross of Christ to crucify them to the world, and therein learn humbly to follow the di∣vine leader:—here is the judgment of this world—here the prince of this world is cast out.</P>
<P>The water of separation is felt; and tho' we have been amongst the slain, and thro' the desire of gain have touched the dead bo∣dy of a man; yet, in the purifying love of
<PB N="222" REF="013782_0236_0F91B50567AFDDC8"/>
Christ, we are washed in the water of sepa∣ration, are brought off from that business, from that gain, and from that fellowship, which was not agreeable to his holy will: and I have felt a renewed confirmation in the time of this voyage, that the Lord, in his infinite love, is calling to his visited chil∣dren, so to give up all outward possessions, and means of getting treasures, that his Ho∣ly Spirit may have free course in their hearts, and direct them in all their proceedings.</P>
<P>To feel the substance pointed at in this figure, man must know death, as to his own will.</P>
<P>"No man can see God, and live:" This was spoken by the Almighty to Moses the prophet; and opened by our blessed Re∣deemer.</P>
<P>As death comes on our own wills, and a new life is formed in us, the heart is purified, and prepared to understand clearly. <Q>Bless∣ed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</Q> In purity of heart, the mind is divinely opened to behold the nature of uni∣versal righteousness, or the righteousness of the kingdom of God. <Q>No man hath seen the Father, save he that is of God; he hath seen the Father.</Q></P>
<P>The natural mind is active about the things of this life; and in this natural acti∣vity, business is proposed, and a will in us to go forward in it. And as long as this na∣tural will remains unsubjected, so long there
<PB N="223" REF="013782_0237_0F91B50599C79FE8"/>
remains an obstruction against the clearness of divine light operating in us; but when we love God with all our heart, and with all our strength; then, in this love, we love our neighbours as ourselves; and a tender∣ness of heart is felt toward all people for whom Christ died, even such who as to out∣ward circumstances may be to us as the Jews were to the Samaritans. Who is my neigh∣bour? See this question answered by our Sa∣viour, Luke x. 30.</P>
<P>In this love we can say, that Jesus is the Lord; and the reformation in our souls, ma∣nifested in a full reformation of our lives, wherein all things are new, and all things are of God; 2 Cor. v. 18. in this the desire of gain is subjected.</P>
<P>When employment is honestly followed in the light of truth; and people become dili∣gent in business, <Q>fervent in spirit; serving the Lord:</Q> Rom. xii. 11. Here the name is opened: <Q>This is the name by which he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</Q> Jere. xxiii. 6. Oh, how precious is this name! It is like ointment poured out. The chaste virgins are in love with the Redeemer; and for the pro∣moting his peaceable kingdom in the world, are content to endure hardness like good sol∣diers; and are so separated in spirit, from the desire of riches, that in their employ∣ments, they become extensively careful to give none offence, neither to Jews nor heathen, nor the church of Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="013782_0238_0F91B5076756A9D8"/>
On the thirty-first day of the month, and first of the week, we had a meeting in the cabbin, with near all the ship's company; the whole being near thirty. In this meet∣ing the Lord, in mercy, favoured us with the extendings of his love.</P>
<P>The second day of the sixth month. Last evening the seamen found bottom at about seventy fathom.</P>
<P>This morning fair wind, and pleasant: and as I sat on deck, my heart was over∣come with the love of Christ, and melted in∣to contrition before him: and in this state, the prospect of that work, to which I have felt my mind drawn when in my native land, being in some degree opened before me, I felt like a little child; and my cries were put up to my heavenly Father for pre∣servation, that in a humble dependance on him, my soul may be strengthened in his love, and kept inwardly waiting for his counsel.</P>
<P>This afternoon we saw that part of Eng∣land called the Lizard.</P>
<P>Some dunghill fowls yet remained of those the passengers took for their sea-store: I be∣lieve about fourteen perished in the storms at sea, by the waves breaking over the quar∣ter-deck; and a considerable number with sickness, at different times.—I observed the cocks crew coming down the Delaware, and while we were near the land; but after∣ward, I think I did not hear one of them
<PB N="225" REF="013782_0239_0F91B50864C2ACD0"/>
crow till we came near the land in England, when they again crowed a few times.</P>
<P>In observing their dull appearance at sea, and the pining sickness of some of them, I often remembered the fountain of goodness, who gave being to all creatures, and whose love extends to that of caring for the spar∣rows; and believe, where the love of God is verily perfected, and the true spirit of go∣vernment watchfully attended to, a tender∣ness toward all creatures made subject to us will be experienced; and a care felt in us, that we do not lessen that sweetness of life, in the animal creation, which the great Creator intends for them under our government.</P>
<P>The fourth day of the month. Wet wea∣ther, high winds, and so dark that we could see but a little way. I perceived our seamen were apprehensive of danger of missing the Channel; which, I understood, was narrow. In a while, it grew lighter; and they saw the land, and they knew where we were. Thus the Father of mercies was pleased to try us with the sight of dangers; and then graci∣ously, from time to time, deliver from them: thus sparing our lives, that in humility and reverence, we may walk before him, and put our trust in him.</P>
<P>About noon a pilot came off from Dover; where my beloved friend Samuel Emlen went on shore, and thence to London, about seven∣ty-two miles by land; but I felt easy in staying in the ship.</P>

The seventh day of the month, and first of the week. Clear morning, lay at anchor for the tide, and had a parting meeting with the ship's company; in which, my heart was enlarged in a fervent concern for them, that they may come to experience salvation thro' Christ.—Had a head wind up the Thames; lay sometimes at anchor; saw many ships passing, and some at anchor near; and had large opportunity of feeling the spirit in which the poor bewildered sailors too gene∣rally live.—That lamentable degeneracy, which so much prevails on the people em∣ployed on the seas, so affected my heart, that I may not easily convey the feeling I have had to another.</P>
<P>The present state of the sea-faring life in general, appears so opposite to that of a pi∣ous education; so full of corruption, and extreme alienation from God; so full of ex∣amples, the most dangerous to young peo∣ple, that in looking toward a young genera∣tion, I feel a care for them, that they may have an education different from the present education of lads at sea: and that all of us, who are acquainted with the pure gospel spi∣rit, may lay this case to heart, may remem∣ber the lamentable corruptions which at∣tends the conveyance of merchandize across the seas, and so abide in the love of Christ, that being delivered from the love of mo∣ney, from the entangling expences of a cu∣rious, delicate luxurious life, we may learn contentment with a little; and promote
<PB N="227" REF="013782_0241_0F91B5095BFF1570"/>
the sea-faring life no further, than that spi∣rit, which leads into all truth, attends us in our proceedings.</P>

<P>His attending the yearly-meeting in London; and after it, proceeding towards Yorkshire, visiting several quarterly and other meetings in the counties of Hertford, Warwick, Ox∣ford, Nottingham, York, and Westmoreland; and thence again into Yorkshire, and to the city of York; with some instructive thoughts and observations, and letters on divers sub∣jects—His hearing of the decease of Wil∣liam Hunt; and some account of him—His sickness at York; and end of his pilgrimage there.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the eighth day of the sixth month, 1772, we landed at London; and I went straightway to the yearly-meeting of ministers and elders, which had been ga∣thered (I suppose) about half an hour.</P>
<P>In this meeting, my mind was humbly contrite: in the afternoon, the meeting of
<PB N="228" REF="013782_0242_0F91B50B51A53E10"/>
business opened; which, by adjournments, held near a week.—in these meetings, I of∣ten felt a living concern for the establishment of friends in the pure life of truth: and my heart was enlarged in the meeting of mi∣nisters, meeting of business, and in several meetings of publick worship; and I felt my mind united in true love, to the faithful la∣bourers now gathered at this yearly-meet∣ing.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth day of the month, I left London, and went to a quarterly-meeting at Hertford.</P>
<P>The first day of the seventh month. I have been at quarterly-meetings at Sherring∣ton, Northampton, Banbury and Shipton; and had sundry meetings between: my mind hath been bowed under a sense of divine goodness manifested amongst us; my heart hath been often enlarged in true love, both amongst ministers and elders, and in publick meetings; that through the Lord's good∣ness, I believe it hath been a fresh visitation to many, in particular to the youth.</P>
<P>The seventeenth day of the month. Was this day at Birmingham: have been at meet∣ings at Coventry, Warwick, in Oxfordshire, and sundry other places; have felt the hum∣bling hand of the Lord upon me; and thro' his tender mercies find peace in the labours I have gone through.</P>
<P>The twenty-sixth day of the month. I have continued travelling northward, visit∣ing
<PB N="229" REF="013782_0243_0F91B50BA3584F30"/>
meetings: was this day at Nottingham; which, in the forenoon especially, was, thro' divine love, a heart-tendering season: next day had a meeting in a friend's house with friends children and some friends; this, thro' the strengthening arm of the Lord, was a time to be thankfully remembered.</P>
<P>The second day of the eighth month, and first of the week, was this day at Sheffield, a large inland town: have been at sundry meetings last week; and feel inward thank∣fulness for that divine support, which hath been graciously extended to me.</P>
<P>The ninth day of the month, and first of the week, was at Rushworth: have lately passed through some painful labour; but have been comforted, under a sense of that divine visitation, which I feel extended to∣ward many young people.</P>
<P>The sixteenth day of the month, and first of the week, was at Settle: it hath of late been a time of inward poverty; under which, my mind hath been preserved in a watchful tender state, feeling for the mind of the ho∣ly Leader, and find peace in the labours I have passed through.</P>
<P>On enquiry, in many places, I find the price of rye about five shillings, wheat about eight shillings, <HI>per</HI> bushel; oatmeal twelve shillings for an hundred and twenty pounds; mutton from three-pence to five-pence <HI>per</HI> pound; bacon, from seven-pence to nine-pence; cheese, from four-pence to six-pence;
<PB N="230" REF="013782_0244_0F91B50C7ABCDD80"/>
butter, from eight-pence to ten-pence; house-rent, for a poor man, from twenty-five shil∣lings to forty shillings <HI>per</HI> year, to be paid weekly; wood, for fire, very scarce and dear; coal, in some places, two shillings and six-pence <HI>per</HI> hundred weight; but near the pits, not a quarter so much. O, may the wealthy consider the poor!</P>
<P>The wages of labouring men in several counties toward London, is ten-pence <HI>per</HI> day in common business, the employer finds small-beer, and the labourer finds his own food; but in harvest and hay time, wages is about one shilling <HI>per</HI> day, and the la∣bourer hath all his diet. In some parts of the north of England, poor labouring men have their food where they work; and ap∣pear, in common, to do rather better than nearer London: industrious women, who spin in the factories, get some four-pence, some five-pence, and so on to six, seven, eight, nine or ten-pence <HI>per</HI> day, and find their own house-room and diet. Great num∣bers of poor people live chiefly on bread and water in the southern parts of England, and some in the northern parts; and there are many poor children not taught even to read. May those who have plenty, lay these things to heart!</P>
<P>Stage-coaches frequently go upwards of an hundred miles in twenty-four hours; and I have heard friends say, in several places, that it is common for horses to be killed with
<PB N="231" REF="013782_0245_0F91B50D33F8A060"/>
hard driving, and many others driven till they grow blind.</P>
<P>Post-boys pursue their business, each one to his stage, all night thro' the winter: some boys, who ride long stages, suffer greatly on winter nights; and, at several places, I have heard of their being froze to death. So great is the hurry in the spirit of this world, that in aiming to do business quick, and to gain wealth, the creation, at this day, doth loudly groan!</P>
<P>As my journey hath been without a horse, I have had several offers of being assisted on my way in these stage-coaches; but have not been in them: nor have I had freedom to send letters by these posts, in the present way of their riding; the stages being so fix∣ed, and one boy dependant on another as to time, that they commonly go upward of one hundred miles in twenty-four hours; and in the cold long winter nights, the poor boys suffer much.</P>
<P>I heard in America of the way of these posts; and cautioned friends in the general meeting of ministers and elders at Philadel∣phia, and in the yearly-meeting of ministers and elders at London, not to send letters to me on any common occasion by post. And though, on this account, I may be likely to hear seldomer from my family left behind; yet, for righteousness sake, I am, thro' di∣vine favour, made content.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="013782_0246_0F91B50DE6F54058"/>
I have felt great distress of mind, since I came on this island, on account of the mem∣bers of our society being mixed with the world in various sorts of business and traf∣fick, carried on in impure channels. Great is the trade to Africa for slaves! and in load∣ing these ships, abundance of people are em∣ployed in the factories; amongst whom are many of our society. Friends, in early times, refused, on a religious principle, to make or trade in superfluities; of which, we have many large testimonies on record: but for want of faithfulness, some gave way; even some, whose examples were of note in our society; and from thence others took more liberty. Members of our society worked in superfluities, and bought and sold them; and thus dimness of sight came over many: at length, friends got into the use of some superfluities in dress, and in the furniture of their houses; and this hath spread from less to more, till superfluity of some kinds is common amongst us.</P>
<P>In this declining state, many look at the example one of another, and too much ne∣glect the pure feeling of truth. Of late years, a deep exercise hath attended my mind, that friends may dig deep, may carefully cast forth the loose matter, and get down to the Rock, the sure foundation, and there hearken to that divine voice which gives a clear and certain sound; and I have felt in that which
<PB N="233" REF="013782_0247_0F91B50EA4175D58"/>
doth not deceive, that if friends, who have known the truth, keep in that tenderness of heart, where all views of outward gain are given up, and their trust is only on the Lord, he will graciously lead some to be pat∣terns of deep self-denial in things relating to trade and handicraft labour; and that some, who have plenty of the treasures of this world, will example in a plain frugal life, and pay wages to such whom they may hire, more liberally than is now customary in some places.</P>
<P>The twenty-third day of the month, was this day at Preston-Patrick, and had a com∣fortable meeting. I have, several times, been entertained at the houses of friends, who had sundry things about them which had the ap∣pearance of outward greatness; and as I have kept inward, way hath opened for con∣versation with such in private, in which di∣vine goodness hath favoured us together, with heart-tendering times.</P>
<P>The twenty-sixth day of the month. Be∣ing now at George Crosfields, in the county of Westmoreland, I feel a concern to com∣mit to writing, that which to me hath been a case uncommon.</P>
<P>In a time of sickness with the pleurisy, a little upward of two years and a half ago, I was brought so near the gates of death, that I forgot my name: being then desirous to know who I was, I saw a mass of matter of a dull gloomy colour, between the south
<PB N="234" REF="013782_0248_0F91B5109B39E4F8"/>
and the east; and was informed, that this mass was human beings in as great misery as they could be, and live; and that I was mixed in with them, and that henceforth I might not consider myself as a distinct or separate being. In this state I remained se∣veral hours. I then heard a soft melodious voice, more pure and harmonious than any I had heard with my ears before; I believ∣ed it was the voice of an angel, who spake to the other angels: the words were—<HI>John Woolman is dead.</HI> I soon remembered that I once was John Woolman; and being assured that I was alive in the body, I greatly won∣dered what that heavenly voice could mean.</P>
<P>I believed, beyond doubting, that it was the voice of an holy angel; but, as yet, it was a mystery to me.</P>
<P>I was then carried in spirit to the mines, where poor oppressed people were digging rich treasures for those called christians; and heard them blaspheme the name of Christ, at which I was grieved; for his name to me was precious.</P>
<P>Then I was informed, that these hea∣then were told, that those who oppressed them were the followers of Christ; and they said amongst themselves, If Christ directed them to use us in this sort, then Christ is a cruel tyrant.</P>
<P>All this time the song of the angel re∣mained a mystery; and in the morning, my dear wife and some others coming to my bed∣side,
<PB N="235" REF="013782_0249_0F91B510E18632F8"/>
I asked them, if they knew who I was: and they telling me, I was John Woolman, thought I was light-headed: for I told them not what the angel said, nor was I disposed to talk much to any one; but was very de∣sirous to get so deep, that I might under∣stand this mystery.</P>
<P>My tongue was often so dry, that I could not speak till I had moved it about and gathered some moisture, and as I lay still for a time, at length I felt divine power pre∣pare my mouth that I could speak; and then I said, <Q>I am crucified with Christ, never∣theless I live; yet not I, but Christ that liveth in me: and the life I now live in the flesh, is by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</Q></P>
<P>Then the mystery was opened; and I per∣ceived there was joy in heaven over a sinner who had repented; and that that language (<HI>John Woolman is dead</HI>) meant no more than the death of my own will.</P>
<P>Soon after this I coughed, and raised much bloody matter; which I had not done during this vision: and now my natural understand∣ing returned as before.—Here I saw, that people getting silver vessels to set off their ta∣bles at entertainments, was often stained with worldly glory; and that in the present state of things, I should take heed how I fed my∣self from out of silver vessels.</P>
<P>Soon after my recovery, I, going to our monthly-meeting, dined at a friend's house
<PB N="236" REF="013782_0250_0F91B51199C06070"/>
where drink was brought in silver vessels, and not in any other; and I wanting some drink, told him my case with weeping: and he ordered some drink for me in another ves∣sel.</P>
<P>The like I afterwards went through in several friend's houses in America, and have also in England, since I came here: and have cause, with humble reverence, to acknow∣ledge the loving-kindness of my heavenly Father, who hath preserved me in such a tender frame of mind, that none, I believe, have ever been offended at what I have said on that occasion.</P>
<P>After this sickness, I spake not in publick meetings for worship for near one year; but my mind was very often in company with the oppressed slaves, as I sat in meetings: and tho', under this dispensation, I was shut up from speaking, yet the spring of the gos∣pel ministry was, many times, livingly open∣ed in me; and the divine gift operated by abundance of weeping, in feeling the op∣pression of this people. It being so long since I passed thro' this dispensation, and the matter remaining fresh and livingly in my mind, I believe it safest for me to commit it to writing.</P>
<P>The thirtieth day of the month. This morning I wrote a letter, in substance as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="237" REF="013782_0251_0F91B5125F827F70"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"MY mind is often affected as I pass along, under a sense of the state of many poor people, who sit under that sort of ministry which requires much outward labour to support it; and the loving-kind∣ness of our heavenly Father, in opening a pure gospel ministry in this nation, hath of∣ten raised thankfulness in my heart to him. I often remember the conflicts of the faith∣ful under persecution, and now look at the free exercise of the pure gift uninterrupted by outward laws, as a trust committed to us; which requires our deepest gratitude, and most careful attention. I feel a tender con∣cern, that the work of reformation, so pros∣perously carried on in this land within a few ages past, may go forward and spread a∣mongst the nations; and may not go back∣ward, thro' dust gathering on our garments, who have been called to a work so great and so precious."</P>
<P>"Last evening I had a little opportunity at thy house, with some of thy family, in thy absence; in which I rejoiced: and feel∣ing a sweetness on my mind toward thee, I now endeavour to open a little of the feeling I had there."</P>
<P>"I have heard, that you, in these parts, have, at certain seasons, meetings of confer∣ence, in relation to friends living up to our principles, in which several meetings unite
<PB N="238" REF="013782_0252_0F91B51459A7FA58"/>
in one; with which I feel unity: I having, in some measure, felt truth lead that way amongst friends in America; and have found, my dear friend, that in these labours all superfluities in our own living, are against us. I feel that pure love toward thee, in which there is freedom."</P>
<P>"I look at that precious gift bestowed on thee, with awfulness before Him who gave it: and feel a care, that we may be so sepa∣rated to the gospel of Christ, that those things which proceed from the spirit of this world, may have no place amongst us."</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>"Thy friend, "John Woolman."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I rested a few days, in body and mind, with our friend Jane Crosfield; who was once in America: was, on the sixth day of the week, at Kendal in Westmoreland; and at Greyrig meeting the thirtieth day of the month, and first of the week.</P>
<P>I have known poverty of late; and been graciously supported to keep in the patience: and am thankful, under a sense of the good∣ness of the Lord toward those that are of a contrite spirit.</P>
<P>The sixth day of the ninth month, and first of the week, was this day at Counter-side; a large meeting-house, and very full: and thro' the opening of pure love, it was
<PB N="239" REF="013782_0253_0F91B5149DF3D8C0"/>
a strengthening time to me, and (I believe) to many more.</P>
<P>The thirteenth day of the month. Was this day at Richmond, a small meeting; but the town's people coming in, the house was crowded: it was a time of heavy labour; and (I believe) was a profitable meeting.</P>
<P>At this place I heard that my kinsman William Hunt from North-Carolina, who was on a religious visit to friends in Eng∣land, departed this life on the ninth day of the ninth month, instant, of the small-pox, at Newcastle.—He appeared in the ministry when a youth; and his labours therein were of good savor. He travelled much in that work in America. I once heard him say in public testimony, that his concern was (in that visit) to be devoted to the service of Christ so fully, that he might not spend one minute in pleasing himself: which words, joined with his example, was a means of stir∣ring up the pure mind in me.</P>
<P>Having of late travelled often in wet wea∣ther, thro' narrow streets in towns and vil∣lages, where dirtiness under foot, and the scent arising from that filth, which more or less infects the air of all thick settled towns; and I being but weakly, have felt distress both in body and mind with that which is impure.</P>
<P>In these journies I have been where much cloth hath been dyed; and sundry times
<PB N="240" REF="013782_0254_0F91B515CFC32BE8"/>
walked over ground, where much of their dye stuffs have drained away.</P>
<P>Here I have felt a longing in my mind, that people might come into cleanness of spi∣rit, cleanness of person, cleanness about their houses and garments.</P>
<P>Some, who are great, carry delicacy to a great height themselves, and yet the real cleanliness is not generally promoted. Dyes being invented partly to please the eye, and partly to hide dirt, I have felt in this weak state, travelling in dirtiness and affected with unwholesome scents, a strong desire that the nature of dyeing cloth to hide dirt may be more fully considered.</P>
<P>To hide dirt in our garments, appears op∣posite to real cleanliness.</P>
<P>To wash garments, and keep them sweet, this appears cleanly.</P>
<P>Thro' giving way to hiding dirt in our garments, a spirit which would cover that which is disagreeable, is strengthened.</P>
<P>Real cleanness becometh a holy people: but hiding that which is not clean by colour∣ing our garments, appears contrary to the sweetness of sincerity.</P>
<P>Thro' some sorts of dyes, cloth is less use∣ful; and if the value of dye-stuffs, the ex∣pence of dyeing, and the damage done to cloth, were all added together, and that ex∣pence applied to keep all sweet and clean, how much more cleanly would people be.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="013782_0255_0F91B516419384C8"/>
On this visit to England I have felt some instructions sealed on my mind, which I am concerned to leave in writing, for the use of such who are called to the station of a mini∣ster of Christ.</P>
<P>Christ being the Prince of Peace, and we being no more than ministers, I find it ne∣cessary for us, not only to feel a concern in our first going forth, but to experience the renewing thereof, in the appointment of meetings.</P>
<P>I felt a concern in America, to prepare for this voyage; and being through the mercy of God, brought safe here, my heart was like a vessel that wanted vent; and for seve∣ral weeks at first, when my mouth was open∣ed in meetings, it often felt like the raising of a gate in a water course, where a weight of water lay upon it; and in these labours there appeared a fresh visitation to many, especially the youth; but sometimes after this, I felt empty and poor, and yet felt a necessi∣ty to appoint meetings.</P>
<P>In this state I was exercised to abide in the pure life of truth, and in all my labours to watch diligently against the motions of self in my own mind.</P>
<P>I have frequently felt a necessity to stand up, when the spring of the ministry was low, and to speak from the necessity, in that which subjecteth the will of the creature; and here∣in I was united with the suffering seed, and found inward sweetness in these mortifying labours.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="013782_0256_0F91B51833AC87E8"/>
As I have been preserved in a watchful at∣tention to the divine leader, under these dis∣pensations, enlargement at times hath fol∣lowed, and the power of truth hath rose high∣er in some meetings, than I ever knew it be∣fore through me.</P>
<P>Thus I have been more and more instruct∣ed, as to the necessity of depending, not up∣on a concern which I felt in America, to come on a visit to England; but upon the fresh in∣structions of Christ the Prince of Peace, from day to day.</P>
<P>Now of late, I felt a stop in the appoint∣ment of meetings, not wholly but in part; and I do not feel liberty to appoint them so quick one after another as I have heretofore.</P>
<P>The work of the ministry, being a work of divine love, I feel that the openings there∣of are to be waited for, in all our appoint∣ments.</P>
<P>Oh how deep is divine wisdom! Christ puts forth his ministers, and goeth before them; and oh how great is the danger of departing from the pure feeling of that which leadeth safely!</P>
<P>Christ knoweth the state of the people, and in the pure feeling of the gospel ministry, their states are opened to his servants.</P>
<P>Christ knoweth when the fruit-bearing branches themselves have need of purging.</P>
<P>Oh that these lessons may be remembered by me! and that all who appoint meetings, may proceed in the pure feeling of duty.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="013782_0257_0F91B518599178A0"/>
I have sometimes felt a necessity to stand up, but that spirit which is of the world hath so much prevailed in many, and the pure life of truth been so pressed down, that I have gone forward, not as one travelling in a road cast up, and well prepared, but as a man walking through a miry place, in which are stones here and there, safe to step on; but so situated that one step being taken, time is necessary to see where to step next.</P>
<P>Now I find that in the pure obedience, the mind learns contentment, in appearing weak and foolish to that wisdom which is of the world; and in these lowly labours, they who stand in a low place, rightly exercised under the cross, will find nourishment.</P>
<P>The gift is pure, and while the eye is sin∣gle in attending thereto, the understanding is preserved clear; self is kept out; we rejoice in filling up that which remains of the af∣flictions of Christ, for his body's sake, which is the church.</P>
<P>The natural man loveth eloquence, and many love to hear eloquent orations; and if there is not a careful attention to the gift, men who have once labour'd in the pure gos∣pel ministry, growing weary of suffering, and ashamed of appearing weak, may kindle a fire, compass themselves about with sparks, and walk in the light; not of Christ who is under suffering; but of that fire, which they, going from the gift, have kindled: And that in hearers, which is gone from the meek suf∣fering state, into the worldly wisdom, may
<PB N="244" REF="013782_0258_0F91B519F72BBFB0"/>
be warmed with this fire, and speak highly of these labours. That which is of God ga∣thers to God; and that which is of the world is owned by the world.</P>
<P>In this journey a labour hath attended my mind, that the ministers amongst us may be preserved in the meek feeling life of truth, where we may have no desire, but to follow Christ and be with him; that when he is un∣der suffering we may suffer with him; and never desire to rise up in dominion, but as he by the virtue of his own spirit may raise us.</P>
<P>A few days after writing these considerati∣ons, our dear friend in the course of his reli∣gious visits, came to the city of York, and attended most of the sittings of the quarterly meeting there; but before it was over, was taken ill of the small-pox. Our friend Tho∣mas Priestman and others who attended him, preserved the following minutes of his expres∣sions in the time of his sickness, and of his decease.</P>
<P>1st day, the 27th of the 9th month 1772. His disorder appeared to be the small-pox: being asked to have a doctor's advice, he sig∣nified he had not freedom or liberty in his mind so to do, standing wholly resigned to his will, who gave him life, and whose pow∣er he had witnessed to raise and heal him in sickness before, when he seemed nigh unto death; and if he was to wind up now, he
<PB N="245" REF="013782_0259_0F91B51B01364D80"/>
was perfectly resigned, having no will either to live or die, and did not choose any should be sent for to him: but a young man, an apothecary, coming of his own accord the next day, and desiring to do something for him, he said he found a freedom to confer with him and the other friends about him, and if any thing should be proposed, as to medicine that did not come thro' defiled chan∣nels or oppressive hands, he should be wil∣ling to consider and take it, so far as he found freedom.</P>
<P>2d day. He said he felt the disorder to af∣fect his head, so that he could think little, and but as a child; and desired if his under∣standing should be more affected, to have nothing given him that those about knew he had a testimony against.</P>
<P>Third-day he uttered the following pray∣er.—O Lord my God, the amazing hor∣rors of darkness were gathered around me and covered me all over, and I saw no way to go forth; I felt the depth and extent of the misery of my fellow creatures separated from the divine harmony, and it was heavi∣er than I could bear, and I was crushed down under it, I lifted up my hand, I stretched out my arm, but there was none to help me; I looked round about and was amazed; in the depths of misery, O Lord! I remembered that thou art omnipotent, that I had called thee Father, and I felt that I loved thee, and I was made quiet in thy will, and I waited for deliverance from thee; thou hadst pity
<PB N="246" REF="013782_0260_0F91B51B5ACA94E0"/>
upon me when no man could help me; I saw that meekness under suffering was shewed to us in the most affecting example of thy Son, and thou taught me to follow him, and I said "thy will O Father be done."</P>
<P>Fourth day morning, being asked how he felt himself, he meekly answered, I don't know that I have slept this night, I feel the disorder making its progress, but my mind is mercifully preserved in stillness and peace: sometime after he said he was sensible the pains of death must be hard to bear, but if he escaped them now, he must sometime pass thro' them, and he did not know that he could be better prepared, but had no will in it. He said he had settled his outward af∣fairs to his mind, had taken leave of his wife and family as never to return, leaving them to the divine protection; adding, and tho' I feel them near to me at this time, yet I freely give them up, having a hope that they will be provided for. And a little after said, This trial is made easier than I could have thought, my will being wholly taken away; for if I was anxious for the event it would have been harder, but I am not, and my mind enjoys a perfect calm.</P>
<P>In the night a young woman having given him something to drink, he said, My child thou seems very kind to me a poor creature, the Lord will reward thee for it. A while af∣ter he cried out with great earnestness of spirit, Oh my Father! my Father! and soon after he said, Oh my Father! my Father!
<PB N="247" REF="013782_0261_0F91B51C38E7A850"/>
how comfortable art thou to my soul in this trying season. Being asked if he could take a little nourishment; after some pause he re∣plied, my child I cannot tell what to say to it; I seem nearly arrived where my soul shall have rest from all its troubles. After giving in something to be inserted in his journal, he said, I believe the Lord will now excuse me from exercises of this kind; and I see no work but one which is to be the last wrought by me in this world, the messenger will come that will release me from all these troubles; but it must be in the Lord's time, which I am waiting for. He said he had laboured to do whatever was required, according to the ability received, in the remembrance of which he had peace; and tho' the disorder was strong at times, and would like a whirl∣wind come over his mind; yet it had hither∣to been kept steady and center'd in everlast∣ing love; adding, and if that be mercifully continued, I ask nor desire no more. An∣other time he said, he had long had a view of visiting this nation, and sometime before he came had a dream, in which he saw himself in the northern parts of it, and that the spring of the gospel was opened in him much as in the beginning of friends, such as George Fox and William Dewsberry, and he saw the different states of the people, as clear as he had ever seen flowers in a garden; but in his going along he was suddenly stopt, tho' he could not see for what end; but
<PB N="248" REF="013782_0262_0F91B51E31FA99F8"/>
looking towards home, fell into a flood of tears which waked him.</P>
<P>At another time he said, my draught seem∣ed strongest towards the North, and I men∣tioned in my own monthly-meeting, that attending the quarterly-meeting at York, and being there looked like home to me.</P>
<P>Fifth-day night, having repeatedly con∣sented to take medicine with a view to settle his stomach, but without effect; the friend then waiting on him, said thro' distress, what shall I do now? He answered with great composure, Rejoice ever more, and in every thing give thanks; but added a little after, this is sometimes hard to come at.</P>
<P>Sixth-day morning he broke forth early in supplication on this wise, O Lord it was thy power that enabled me to forsake sin in my youth, and I have felt thy bruises for dis∣obedience; but as I bowed under them thou healed me, continuing a father and a friend; I feel thy power now, and I beg that in the approaching trying moment Thou wilt keep my heart stedfast unto thee. Upon his giv∣ing directions to a friend concerning some little things, she said I will take care, but hope thou wilt live to order them thyself; he reply'd, my hope is in Christ, and tho' I may seem a little better, a change in the dis∣order may soon happen, and my little strength be dissolved, and if it so happens, I shall be gathered to my everlasting rest. On her say∣ing she did not doubt that, but could not help mourning to see so many faithful ser∣vants
<PB N="249" REF="013782_0263_0F91B51E97F911D8"/>
removed at so low a time; he said all good cometh from the Lord, whose power is the same, and can work as he sees best. The same day he had given directions about wrapping his corpse; perceiving a friend to weep, he said I would rather thou wouldst guard against weeping for me, my sister, I sorrow not, tho' I have had some painful con∣flicts, but now they seem over and matters well settled, and I took at the face of my dear redeemer, for sweet is his voice and his countenance is comely.</P>
<P>First-day, fourth of the tenth month, being very weak and in general difficult to be un∣derstood, he uttered a few words in comme∣moration of the Lord's goodness; and add∣ed, how tenderly have I been waited on in this time of affliction, in which I may say in Job's words, Tedious days and wearisome nights are appointed unto me, and how ma∣ny are spending their time and money in vanity and superfluities, while thousands and tens of thousands want the necessaries of life, who might be relieved by them, and their distresses at such a time as this, in some degree softened by the administring suitable things.</P>
<P>Second-day morning the apothecary who appeared very anxious to assist him, being present, he queried about the probability of such a load of matter being thrown off his weak body, and the apothecary making some remarks implying he thought it might; he spoke with an audible voice on this wise,
<PB N="250" REF="013782_0264_0F91B51F2EA4A0C8"/>
My dependance is on the Lord Jesus, who I trust will forgive my sins, which is all I hope for, and if it be his will to raise up this body again, I am content; and if to die, I and re∣signed; and if thou canst not be easy with∣out trying to assist nature, I submit: after which his throat was so much affected, that it was very difficult for him to speak so as to be understood, and frequently wrote when he wanted any thing. About the second hour on fourth-day morning he asked for pen and ink, and at several times with much difficulty wrote thus, I believe my being here is in the wisdom of Christ, I know not as to life or death.</P>
<P>About a quarter before six the same morn∣ing he seemed to fall into an easy sleep, which continued about half an hour, when seeming to awake, he breathed a few times with more difficulty, and expired without sigh, groan, or struggle.</P>

<HEAD>SOME CONSIDERATIONS On the KEEPING of NEGROES. Recommended to the Professors of Christi∣anity of every Denomination. First printed in the year 1754.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>CUSTOMS <HI>generally approved, and</HI> opi∣nions <HI>received by youth from their supe∣riors, become like the natural produce of a soil, especially when they are suited to favourite in∣clinations: but as the judgments of God are without partiality, by which the state of the soul must be tried, it would be the highest wis∣dom to forego customs and popular opinions, and try the treasures of the soul by the infallible standard</HI> truth.</P>
<P>Natural affection <HI>needs a careful examina∣tion: operating upon us in a soft manner,</HI> it <HI>kin∣dles desires of love and tenderness, and there is danger of taking it for something higher. To
<PB N="254" REF="013782_0267_0F91B5215C8DE7F0"/>
me it appears an instinct like that which inferior creatures have; each of them, we see, by the ties of nature, love</HI> self <HI>best; that which is a part of</HI> self, <HI>they love by the same tie or in∣stinct. In them it, in some measure, does the of∣fices of reason, by which, among other things, they watchfully keep, and orderly feed their helpless offspring. Thus</HI> natural affection <HI>ap∣pears to be a branch of</HI> self-love, <HI>good in the animal race, in us likewise, with proper limita∣tions; but otherwise is productive of evil, by exciting desires to promote</HI> some <HI>by means preju∣dicial to</HI> others.</P>
<P><HI>Our blessed Saviour seems to give a check to this irregular fondness in nature, and, at the same time, a precedent for us:</HI> <Q>Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</Q> <HI>there∣by intimating, that the earthly ties of relation∣ship, are, comparatively, inconsiderable to such, who, thro' a steady course of obedience, have come to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> happy experience of the spirit of God hearing witness with their spirits that they are his children:</HI>—<Q>And he stretched forth his hands towards his disciples, and said, Behold my mother, and my brethren: For whosoever shall do the will of my Fa∣ther which is in heaven (<HI>arrives at the more noble part of true relationship</HI>)</Q> <Q>the same is my brother, and sister, and mother,</Q> <HI>Matt.</HI> xii. 48.</P>
<P><HI>This doctrine agrees well with a state truly compleat, where</HI> love <HI>necessarily operates ac∣cording
<PB N="255" REF="013782_0268_0F91B5222AB209D8"/>
to the agreeableness of things on princi∣ples unalterable and in themselves perfect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If endeavouring to have my children eminent amongst men after my death, be that which no reasons grounded on those principles can be brought to support; then to be temperate in my pursuit after gain, and to keep always within the bounds of those principles, is an indispensable duty, and to depart from it, a dark unfruitful toil.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In our present condition, to</HI> love <HI>our children is needful; but except this</HI> love <HI>proceeds from the true heavenly principle which sees beyond earthly treasures, it will rather be injurious than of any real advantage to them: where the fountain is corrupt, the streams must necessarily be impure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That important injunction of our Saviour, Matt.</HI> vi. 33. <HI>with the Promise annexed, con∣tains a short but comprehensive view of our du∣ty and happiness:—If then the business of man∣kind in this life, is, to first seek another; if this cannot be done, but by attending to the means; if a summary of the means is,</HI> Not to do that to another which, in like circumstances, we would not have done unto us, <HI>then these are points of moment, and worthy of our most seri∣ous consideration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What I write on this subject is with reluct∣ance, and the hints given are in as general terms as my concern would allow: I know it is a point about which, in all its branches, men that appear to aim well are not generally a∣greed;
<PB N="256" REF="013782_0269_0F91B522DC990B80"/>
and for that reason, I chose to avoid be∣ing very particular.—If I may happily have let drop any thing that may excite such as are con∣cerned in the practice to a close thinking on the subject treated of, the candid amongst them may easily do the subject such further justice, as, on an impartial enquiry, it may appear to deserve; and such an enquiry I would earnestly recom∣mend.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SOME CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATT. xxv. 40.</BIBL>
<Q>Forasmuch as ye did it to the least of these my brethren, ye did it unto me.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS many times there are different mo∣tives to the same actions; and one does that from a generous heart, which another does for selfish ends.—The like may be said in this case.</P>
<P>There are various circumstances amongst them that keep negroes, and different ways by which they fall under their care; and, I doubt not, there are many well-disposed per∣sons amongst them who desire rather to ma∣nage wisely and justly in this difficult mat∣ter, than to make gain of it.</P>
<P>But the general disadvantage which these poor Africans lie under in an enlight'ned christian country, having often filled me with real sadness, and been like undigested matter on my mind, I now think it my duty, thro' divine aid, to offer some thoughts thereon to the consideration of others.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="013782_0271_0F91B5249A385760"/>
When we remember that all nations are of one blood, Gen iii. 20. that in this world we are but sojourners, that we are subject to the like afflictions and infirmities of body, the like disorders and frailties in mind, the like temptations, the same death, and the same judgment, and, that the all-wise Being is Judge and Lord over us all, it seems to raise an idea of a general brotherhood, and a dis∣position easy to be touched with a feeling of each others afflictions: but when we forget those things, and look chiefly at our out∣ward circumstances, in this and some ages past, constantly retaining in our minds the distinction betwixt us and them, with re∣spect to our knowledge and improvement in things divine, natural and artificial, our breasts being apt to be filled with fond no∣tions of superiority, there is danger of err∣ing in our conduct toward them.</P>
<P>We allow them to be of the same species with ourselves; the odds is, we are in a high∣er station, and enjoy greater favours than they. And when it is thus, that our heaven∣ly Father endoweth some of his children with distinguished gifts, they are intended for good ends; but if those thus gifted are thereby lifted up above their brethren, not considering themselves as debtors to the weak, nor behaving themselves as faithful stewards, none who judge impartially can suppose them free from ingratitude.</P>
<P>When a people dwell under the liberal di∣stribution of favours from heaven, it be∣hoves
<PB N="259" REF="013782_0272_0F91B526C27DC970"/>
them carefully to inspect their ways, and consider the purposes for which those favours were bestowed, lest, thro' forgetful∣ness of God, and misusing his gifts, they in∣cur his heavy displeasure, whose judgments are just and equal, who exalteth and hum∣bleth to the dust as he seeth meet.</P>
<P>It appears, by Holy Record, that men un∣der high favours have been apt to err in their opinions concerning others. Thus Israel, ac∣cording to the description of the prophet, Isa. lxv. 5. when exceedingly corrupted and degenerated, yet remembered they were the chosen people of God; and could say, <Q>Stand by thyself, come not near me, for I am ho∣lier than thou.</Q> That this was no chance language, but their common opinion of other people, more fully appears, by considering the circumstances which attended when God was beginning to fulfil his precious promises concerning the gathering of the Gentiles.</P>
<P>The Most-High, in a vision, undeceived Peter, first prepared his heart to believe; and, at the house of Cornelius, shewed him of a certainty that God was no respecter of persons.</P>
<P>The effusion of the Holy Ghost upon a people, with whom they, the Jewish chris∣tians would not so much as eat, was strange to them: All they of the circumcision were astonished to see it; and the apostles and bre∣thren of Judea contended with Peter about it, till he, having rehearsed the whole mat∣ter, and fully shewn that the Father's love
<PB N="260" REF="013782_0273_0F91B527678F6D18"/>
was unlimited, they are thereat struck with admiration, and cry out, <Q>Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life!</Q></P>
<P>The opinion of peculiar favours being con∣fined to them, was deeply rooted, or else the above instance had been less strange to them, for these reasons: First, They were generally acquainted with the writings of the pro∣phets, by whom this time was repeatedly spoken of, and pointed at. Secondly, Our blessed Lord shortly before expresly said, <Q>I have other sheep, not of this fold, them also must I bring,</Q> &amp;c. Lastly, His words to them after his resurrection, at the very time of his ascension, <Q>Ye shall be witnesses to me, not only in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria, but to the uttermost parts of the earth.</Q></P>
<P>Those concurring circumstances, one would think, might have raised a strong expectation of seeing such a time; yet, when it came, it proved matter of offence and astonishment.</P>
<P>To consider mankind otherwise than bre∣thren, to think favours are peculiar to one nation, and exclude others, plainly supposes a darkness in the understanding: for as God's love is universal, so where the mind is suf∣ficiently influenced by it, it begets a likeness of itself, and the heart is enlarged towards all men. Again, to conclude a people fro∣ward, perverse, and worse by nature than others (who ungratefully receive favours, and apply them to bad ends) this will excite
<PB N="261" REF="013782_0274_0F91B52A991EA618"/>
a behaviour toward them unbecoming the excellence of true religion.</P>
<P>To prevent such error, let us calmly consi∣der their circumstance; and, the better to do it, make their case ours. Suppose, then, that our ancestors and we had been exposed to constant servitude, in the more servile and inferior employments of life; that we had been destitute of the help of reading and good company; that amongst ourselves we had had few wise and pious instructors; that the religious amongst our superiors seldom took notice of us; that while others, in ease, have plentifully heaped up the fruit of our labour, we had received barely enough to re∣lieve nature; and being wholly at the com∣mand of others, had generally been treated as a contemptible, ignorant part of man∣kind: should we, in that case, be less abject than they now are? Again, If oppression be so hard to bear, that a wise man is made mad by it, Eccl. vii. 7. then a series of those things altering the behaviour and manners of a people, is what may reasonably be ex∣pected.</P>
<P>When our property is taken contrary to our mind, by means appearing to us unjust, it is only through divine influence, and the enlargement of heart from thence proceed∣ing, that we can love our reputed oppres∣sors: if the Negroes fall short in this, an uneasy, if not a disconsolate disposition, will be awakened, and remain like seeds in their minds, producing sloth and many other ha∣bits
<PB N="262" REF="013782_0275_0F91B52BC22FD468"/>
appearing odious to us; with which, be∣ing free men, they, perhaps, had not been chargeable. These, and other circumstances, rightly considered, will lessen that too great disparity, which some make between us and them.</P>
<P>Integrity of heart hath appeared in some of them; so that, if we continue in the word of Christ (previous to discipleship, John viii. 31.) and our conduct towards them be sea∣soned with his love, we may hope to see the good effect of it: the which, in a good de∣gree, is the case with some into whose hands they have fallen: but that too many treat them otherwise, not seeming conscious of any neglect, is, alas! too evident.</P>
<P>When self-love presides in our minds, our opinions are biassed in our own favour; in this condition, being concerned with a peo∣ple so situated, that they have no voice to plead their own cause, there's danger of us∣ing ourselves to an undisturbed partiality, till, by long custom, the mind becomes re∣conciled with it, and the judgment itself in∣fected.</P>
<P>To humbly apply to God for wisdom, that we may thereby be enabled to see things as they are, and ought to be, is very needful; hereby the hidden things of darkness may be brought to light, and the judgment made clear: we shall then consider mankind as bre∣thren. Though different degrees and a vari∣ety of qualifications and abilities, one de∣pendant on another, be admitted, yet high
<PB N="263" REF="013782_0276_0F91B52BE10B1370"/>
thoughts will be laid aside, and all men treat∣ed as becometh the sons of one father, agree∣able to the doctrine of Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>"He hath laid down the best criterion, by which mankind ought to judge of their own conduct, and others judge for them of theirs, one towards another, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>What∣soever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.</Q> I take it, that all men by nature, are equally entitled to the equity of this rule, and under the in∣dispensable obligations of it. One man ought not to look upon another man, or society of men, as so far beneath him; but that he should put himself in their place, in all his actions towards them, and bring all to this test, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> How should I approve of this con∣duct, were I in their circumstance, and they in mine?" A. Arscot's Considerations, p. III. fol. 107.</P>
<P>This doctrine being of a moral unchange∣able nature, hath been likewise inculcated in the former dispensation; <Q>If a stranger so∣journ with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him; but the stranger that dwelleth with you, shall be as one born amongst you, and thou shalt love him as thyself,</Q> Lev. xix. 33, 34. Had these people come vo∣luntary and dwelt amongst us, to have called them strangers would be proper; and their being brought by force, with regret, and a languishing mind, may well raise compassion in a heart rightly disposed: but there is no∣thing in such treatment, which upon a wise
<PB N="264" REF="013782_0277_0F91B52CD6A1ABB0"/>
and judicious consideration, will any ways lessen their right of being treated as stran∣gers. If the treatment which many of them meet with, be rightly examined and com∣pared with those precepts, <Q>Thou shalt not vex him nor oppress him; he shall be as one born amongst you, and thou shalt love him as thyself,</Q> Lev. xix. 33. Deut. xxvii. 19, there will appear an important difference betwixt them.</P>
<P>It may be objected there is cost of pur∣chase, and risque of their lives to them who possess 'em, and therefore needful that they make the best use of their time: in a prac∣tice just and reasonable, such objections may have weight; but if the work be wrong from the beginning, there is little or no force in them. If I purchase a man who hath never forfeited his liberty, the natural right of freedom is in him; and shall I keep him and his posterity in servitude and ignorance? "How should I approve of this conduct, were I in his circumstances, and he in mine?" It may be thought, that to treat them as we would willingly be treated, our gain by them would be inconsiderable: and it were, in di∣vers respects, better that there were none in our country.</P>
<P>We may further consider, that they are now amongst us, and those of our nation the cause of their being here; that whatsoever difficulty accrues thereon, we are justly chargeable with, and to bear all inconveni∣encies attending it, with a serious and weigh∣ty
<PB N="265" REF="013782_0278_0F91B52D65ED7518"/>
concern of mind to do our duty by them, is the best we can do. To seek a remedy by continuing the oppression, because we have power to do it, and see others do it, will, I apprehend, not be doing as we would be done by.</P>
<P>How deeply soever men are involved in the most exquisite difficulties, sincerity of heart, and upright walking before God, free∣ly submitting to his providence, is the most sure remedy: He only is able to relieve, not only persons, but nations, in their greatest calamities.</P>
<P>David, in a great strait, when the sense of his past error, and the full expectation of an impending calamity, as the reward of it, were united to the aggravating his distress, after some deliberation, saith, <Q>Let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for very great are his mercies; let me not fall in∣to the hand of man.</Q> 1 Chron. xxi. 13.</P>
<P>To act continually with integrity of heart, above all narrow or selfish motives, is a sure token of our being partakers of that salva∣tion which <Q>God hath appointed for walls and bulwarks,</Q> Isa. v. 26. Rom. xv. 8. and is, beyond all contradiction, a more happy situation than can ever be promised by the utmost reach of art and power united, not proceeding from heavenly wisdom.</P>
<P>A supply to nature's lawful wants, joined with a peaceful, humble mind, is the truest happiness in this life; and if here we arrive to this, and remain to walk in the path of
<PB N="266" REF="013782_0279_0F91B52E5416F990"/>
the just, our case will be truly happy: and though herein we may part with, or miss of some glaring shews of riches, and leave our children little else but wise instructions, a good example, and the knowledge of some honest employment; these, with the blessing of Providence, are sufficient for their happi∣ness, and are more likely to prove so, than laying up treasures for them, which are of∣ten rather a snare, than any real benefit; es∣pecially to them, who, instead of being ex∣ampled to temperance, are in all things taught to prefer the getting of riches, and to eye the temporal distinctions they give, as the principal business of this life. These rea∣dily overlook the true happiness of man, as it results from the enjoyment of all things in the fear of God, and, miserably substituting an inferior good, dangerous in the acquir∣ing, and uncertain in the fruition, they are subject to many disappointments, and every sweet carries its sting.</P>
<P>It is the conclusion of our blessed Lord and his apostles, as appears by their lives and doctrines, that the highest delights of sense, or most pleasing objects visible, ought ever to be accounted infinitely inferior to that real intellectual happiness suited to man in his primitive innocence, and now to be found in true renovation of mind; and that the com∣forts of our present life, the things most grateful to us, ought always to be received with temperance, and never made the chief objects of our desire, hope, or love: but that
<PB N="267" REF="013782_0280_0F91B52EE2098FE0"/>
our whole heart and affections be principally looking to that <Q>city, which hath founda∣tions, whose maker and builder is God.</Q> Did we so improve the gifts bestowed on us, that our children might have an education suited to these doctrines, and our example to confirm it, we might rejoice in hopes of their being heirs of an inheritance incorruptible.</P>
<P>This inheritance, as christians, we esteem the most valuable; and how then can we fail to desire it for our children? O that we were consistent with ourselves, in pursuing means necessary to obtain it!</P>
<P>It appears, by experience, that where chil∣dren are educated in fulness, ease and idle∣ness, evil habits are more prevalent, than in common amongst such who are prudently employed in the necessary affairs of life: and if children are not only educated in the way of so great temptation, but have also the op∣portunity of lording it over their fellow-creatures, and being masters of men in their childhood, how can we hope otherwise than that their tender minds will be possessed with thoughts too high for them? which, by con∣tinuance, gaining strength, will prove, like a slow current, gradually separating them from (or keeping from acquaintance with) that humility and meekness in which alone lasting happiness can be enjoyed.</P>
<P>Man is born to labour, and experience a∣bundantly sheweth, that it is for our good: but where the powerful lay the burthen on the inferior, without affording a christian
<PB N="268" REF="013782_0281_0F91B52FE1F99220"/>
education, and suitable opportunity of im∣proving the mind, and a treatment which we, in their case, should approve, that them∣selves may live at ease, and fare sumptuous∣ly, and lay up riches for their posterity, this seems to contradict the design of Providence, and, I doubt, is sometimes the effect of a perverted mind: for while the life of one is made grievous by the rigour of another, it entails misery on both.</P>
<P>Amongst the manifold works of Provi∣dence, displayed in the different ages of the world, these which follow (with many others) may afford instruction.</P>
<P>Abraham was called of God to leave his country and kindred, to sojourn amongst strangers: through famine, and danger of death, he was forced to flee from one king∣dom to another: he, at length, not only had assurance of being the father of many na∣tions, but became a mighty prince. Genesis xxiii. 6.</P>
<P>Remarkable were the dealings of God with Jacob in a low estate, the just sense he re∣tained of them after his advancement, ap∣pears by his words: <Q>I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies.</Q> Genesis xxxii. 10. xlviii. 15.</P>
<P>The numerous afflictions of Joseph are very singular; the particular providence of God therein, no less manifest: he, at length, became governor of Egypt, and famous for wisdom and virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="013782_0282_0F91B531DD64BC08"/>
The series of troubles David passed thro', few amongst us are ignorant of; and yet he afterwards became as one of the great men of the earth.</P>
<P>Some evidences of the divine wisdom ap∣pears in those things, in that such who are intended for high stations, have first been very low and dejected, that truth might be sealed on their hearts; and that the charac∣ters there imprinted by bitterness and adver∣sity, might in after years remain, suggest∣ing compassionate ideas, and, in their pro∣sperity, quicken their regard to those in the like condition: which yet further appears in the case of Israel: they were well acquaint∣ed with grievous sufferings, a long and rigo∣rous servitude; then, thro' many notable e∣vents, were made chief amongst the nations: to them we find a repetition of precepts to the purpose abovesaid: though, for ends a∣greeable to infinite wisdom, they were chose as a peculiar people for a time; yet the Most High acquaints them, that his love is not confined, but extends to the stranger; and, to excite their compassion, reminds them of times past, <Q>Ye were strangers in the land of Egypt, Deut. x. 19. Again, Thou shalt not oppress a stranger, for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt,</Q> Exod. xxiii. 9.</P>
<P>If we call to mind our beginning, some of us may find a time, wherein our fathers were
<PB N="270" REF="013782_0283_0F91B532A5399250"/>
under afflictions, reproaches, and manifold sufferings.</P>
<P>Respecting our progress in this land, the time is short since our beginning was small and number few, compared with the native inhabitants. He that sleeps not by day nor night, hath watched over us, and kept us as the apple of his eye. His almighty arm hath been round about us, and saved us from dangers.</P>
<P>The wilderness and solitary desarts in which our fathers passed the days of their pilgrimage, are now turned into pleasant fields; the natives are gone from before us, and we established peaceably in the possession of the land, enjoying our civil and religious liberties; and, while many parts of the world have groaned under the heavy calami∣ties of war, our habitation remains quiet, and our land fruitful.</P>
<P>When we trace back the steps we have trodden, and see how the Lord hath opened a way in the wilderness for us, to the wise it will easily appear, that all this was not done to be buried in oblivion; but to pre∣pare a people for more fruitful returns, and the remembrance thereof, ought to humble us in prosperity, and excite in us a christian benevolence towards our inferiors.</P>
<P>If we do not consider these things aright, but, through a stupid indolence, conceive views of interest, separate from the general good of the great brotherhood, and, in pur∣suance thereof, treat our inferiors with ri∣gour,
<PB N="271" REF="013782_0284_0F91B53363439A68"/>
to increase our wealth, and gain riches for our children; <Q>What then shall we do when God riseth up? and when he visit∣eth, what shall we answer him? did not he that made us, make them? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</Q> Job xxxi. 13, 14.</P>
<P>To our great master we stand or all, to judge or condemn us as is most suitable toh is wisdom or authority; my inclination is to persuade, and intreat, and simply give hints of my way of thinking.</P>
<P>If the christian religion be considered, both respecting its doctrines, and the happy in∣fluence which it hath on the minds and manners of all real christians, it looks rea∣sonable to think, that the miraculous mani∣festation thereof to the world, is a kindness beyond expression.</P>
<P>Are we the people thus favoured? are we they whose minds are opened, influenced, and governed by the Spirit of Christ, and thereby made sons of God? is it not a fair conclusion, that we, like our heavenly Fa∣ther, ought, in our degree, to be active in the same great cause, of the eternal happi∣ness of, at least, our whole families, and more, if thereto capacitated?</P>
<P>If we, by the operation of the Spirit of Christ, become heirs with him in the king∣dom of his Father, and are redeemed from the alluring counterfeit joys of this world, and the joy of Christ remain in us, to sup∣pose that one remaining in this happy con∣dition,
<PB N="272" REF="013782_0285_0F91B534217385B8"/>
can, for the sake of earthly riches; not only deprive his fellow-creatures of the sweetness of freedom, (which, rightly used, is one of the greatest temporal blessings) but therewith neglect using proper means, for their acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures, and the advantage of true religion, seems, at least, a contradiction to reason.</P>
<P>Whoever rightly advocates the cause of some, thereby promotes the good of all. The state of mankind was harmonious in the beginning, and though sin hath introduced discord, yet, through the wonderful love of God, in Christ Jesus our Lord, the way is open for our redemption, and means ap∣pointed to restore us to primitive har∣mony. That if one suffer by the unfaith∣fulness of another, the mind, the most no∣ble part of him that occasions the discord, is thereby alienated from its true and real hap∣piness.</P>
<P>Our duty and interest is inseparably unit∣ed, and when we neglect or misuse our ta∣lents, we necessarily depart from the heaven∣ly fellowship, and are in the way to the greatest of evils.</P>
<P>Therefore to examine and prove ourselves, to find what harmony the power presiding in us bears with the divine nature, is a duty not more incumbent and necessary, than it would be beneficial.</P>
<P>In Holy Writ the Divine Being faith of himself, <Q>I am the Lord, which exercise loving-kindness, judgment and righteous∣ness
<PB N="273" REF="013782_0286_0F91B534E672BA48"/>
in the earth; for in these things I de∣light, saith the Lord,</Q> Jer. ix. 24. Again, speaking in the way of man, to shew his compassion to Israel, whose wickedness had occasioned a calamity, and then being hum∣bled under it, it is said, <Q>His soul was grieved for their miseries,</Q> Judges x. 16. If we consider the life of our blessed Saviour when on earth, as it is recorded by his fol∣lowers, we shall find, that one uniform de∣sire for the eternal, and temporal good of mankind, discovered itself in all his actions.</P>
<P>If we observe men, both apostles and o∣thers, in many different ages, who have really come to the unity of the Spirit, and the fellowship of the saints, there still appears the like disposition, and in them the desire of the real happiness of mankind, has out∣balanced the desire of ease, liberty, and, many times, life itself.</P>
<P>If upon a true search, we find that our na∣tures are so far renewed, that to exercise righ∣teousness and loving-kindness (according to our ability) towards all men, without respect of persons, is easy to us, or is our delight; if our love be so orderly, and regular, that he who doeth the will of our Father, who is in heaven, appears in our view, to be our nearest relation, our brother, and sister, and mother; if this be our case, there is a good foundation to hope, that the blessing of God will sweeten our treasures during our stay in this life, and our memory be savory, when we are entered into rest.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="013782_0287_0F91B535A681C1F0"/>
To conclude, 'Tis a truth most certain, that a life guided by wisdom from above, agreeable with justice, equity, and mercy, is throughout consistent and amiable, and truly beneficial to society; the serenity and calmness of mind in it, affords an unparal∣lelled comfort in this life, and the end of it is blessed.</P>
<P>And, no less true, that they, who in the midst of high favours, remain ungrateful, and under all the advantages that a christian can desire, are selfish, earthly, and sensual, do miss the true fountain of happiness, and wander in a maze of dark anxiety, where all their treasures are insufficient to quiet their minds: hence, from an insatiable craving, they neglect doing good with what they have acquired, and too often add oppression to va∣nity, that they may compass more.</P>
<P><Q>O that they were wise, that they under∣stood this, that they would consider their latter end!</Q> Deut. xxxii. 29.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALL our actions are of like nature with their root; and the Most High weigheth them more skilfully than Men can weigh them one for another,</HI></P>
<P><HI>I believe that one Supreme Being made and supports the world; nor can I worship any other Deity without being an idolater, and guilty of wickedness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="013782_0289_0F91B537F4752748"/>
<HI>Many nations have believed in, and worship∣ped a plurality of deities; but I do not believe they were therefore all wicked. Idolatry indeed is wickedness; but it is the thing, not the name, which is so. Real idolatry is to pay that ado∣ration to a creature, which is known to be due only to the true God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He who professeth to believe one Almighty Creator, and in his Son Jesus Christ, and is yet more intent on the honours, profits and friend∣ships of the world, than he is in singleness of heart to</HI> stand faithful to the christian religion, <HI>is in the channel of idolatry; while the</HI> Gentile, <HI>who, under some mistaken opinions, is notwith∣standing established in the true principle of vir∣tue, and humbly adores and almighty power, may be of that number who fear God, and work righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I believe the bishop of Rome assumes a power, that does not belong to any officer in the church of Christ; and if I should knowingly do any thing, tending to strengthen him in that capa∣city, it would be great iniquity. There are ma∣ny thousands of people, who by their profession acknowledge him to be the representative of Je∣sus Christ on earth; and to say that none of them are upright in heart, would be contrary to my sentiments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Men who sincerely apply their minds to true virtue, and find an inward support from above, by which all vicious inclinations are made sub∣ject; that they love God sincerely, and prefer the real good of mankind universally to their
<PB N="277" REF="013782_0290_0F91B539EDBAFC48"/>
own private interest; though these, through the strength of education and tradition, may remain under some speculative and great errors, it would be uncharitable to say, that therefore God rejects them.—He who creates, supports and gives un∣derstanding to all men, his knowledge and good∣ness is superior to the various cases and circum∣stances of his creatures, which to us appear the most difficult.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The apostles and primitive christians did not censure all the Gentiles as wicked men, Rom.</HI> ii. 14. <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 11. <HI>but as they were favoured with a gift to discern things more clearly, respecting the worship of the true God, they with much firmness declared against the worshipping of I∣dols; and with true patience endured many suf∣ferings, on that account.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Great numbers of faithful Protestants have contended for the truth, in opposition to</HI> papal <HI>errors; and with true fortitude laid down their lives in the conflict, without saying, That no man was saved who made profession of that re∣ligion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>While we have no right to keep men as ser∣vants for term of life, but that of superior pow∣er; to do this, with design by their labour to profit ourselves and our families, I believe is wrong; but I do not believe that all who have kept slaves, have therefore been chargeable with guilt. If their motives thereto were free from selfishness, and their slaves content, they were a sort of freemen; which I believe hath some∣times been the case.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="013782_0291_0F91B53A68985580"/>
<HI>Whatever a man does in the sptiri of charity, to him it is not sin: and while be lives and acts in this spirit, he learns all things essential to his happiness, as an individual: and if he doth not see that any injury or injustice, to any other per∣son, is necessarily promoted by any part of his form of government, I believe the merciful Judge will not lay iniquity to his charge. Yet others, who live in the same spirit of charity, from a clear convincement, may see the relation of one thing to another, and the necessary ten∣dency of each; and hence it may be absolutely binding on them to desist from some parts of con∣duct, which some good men have been in.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS On the KEEPING of NEGROES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART the SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>AS some in most religious societies a∣mongst the English are concerned in importing or purchasing the inhabi∣tants of Africa as slaves; and as the profes∣sors of christianity of several other nations do the like; these circumstances tend to make people less apt to examine the practice so closely as they would, if such a thing had not been, but was now proposed to be en∣tered upon. It is however our duty, and what concerns us individually, as creatures accountable to our Creator, to employ right∣ly the understanding which he hath given us, in humbly endeavouring to be acquaint∣ed with his will concerning us, and with the nature and tendency of those things which we practise: for as justice remains to be jus∣tice, so many people, of reputation in the
<PB N="280" REF="013782_0293_0F91B53D1A636EA0"/>
world, joining with wrong things, do not excuse others in joining with them, nor make the consequence of their proceedings less dreadful in the final issue, than it would be otherwise.</P>
<P>Where unrighteousness is justified from one age to another, it is like dark matter gathering into clouds over us. We may know that this gloom will remain till the cause be removed by a reformation, or change of times; and may feel a desire, from a love of equity, to speak on the occasion; yet where error is so strong, that it may not be spoken against, without some prospect of inconvenience to the speaker, this difficulty is likely to operate on our weakness, and quench the good desires in us; except we dwell so steadily under the weight of it, as to be made willing to "endure hardness" on that account.</P>
<P>Where men exert their talents against vices generally accounted such, the ill effects whereof are presently perceived in a govern∣ment, all men who regard their own tempo∣ral good, are likely to approve the work. But when that which is inconsistent with perfect equity, hath the law, or countenance of the great in its favour, though the ten∣dency thereof be quite contrary to the true happiness of mankind in an equal, if not greater, degree, than many things account∣ed reproachful to christians; yet, as these ill effects are not generally perceived, they who labour to dissuade from such things, which
<PB N="281" REF="013782_0294_0F91B53E847B08A0"/>
people believe accord with their interest, have many difficulties to encounter.</P>
<P>The repeated charges, which God gave to his prophets, imply the danger they were in of erring on this Hand. <Q>Be not afraid of their faces; for I am with thee, to deliver thee, saith the Lord. Jer. i. 8. Speak all the words that I command thee to speak to them; diminish not a word.</Q> Jer. xxvi. 2. <Q>And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor dismayed at their looks. Speak my words to them, whether they will hear or forbear.</Q> Ezek. ii. 6, 7.</P>
<P>Under an apprehension of duty, I offer some further considerations on this subject, having endeavoured some years to consider it candidly. I have observed people of our own colour, whose abilities have been infe∣rior to the affairs which relate to their con∣venient subsistence, who have been taken care of by others, and the profit of such work as they could do, applied toward their support.—I believe there are such amongst negroes; and that some people, in whose hands they are, keep them with no view of outward profit, do not consider them as black men, who, as such, ought to serve white men; but account them persons who have need of guardians, and as such take care of them: yet where equal care is taken in all parts of education, I do not apprehend cases of this sort are likely to occur more frequent∣ly amongst one sort of people than another.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="013782_0295_0F91B54081849490"/>
It looks to me that the slave trade was founded, and hath generally been carried on, in a wrong spirit; that the effects of it are detrimental to the real prosperity of our country; and will be more so, except we cease from the common motives of keeping them, and treat them in future agreeable to truth and pure justice.</P>
<P>Negroes may be imported, who, for their cruelty to their countrymen, and the evil disposition of their minds, may be unfit to be at liberty; and if we, as lovers of righte∣ousness, undertake the management of them, we should have a full and clear knowledge of their crimes, and of those circumstances which might operate in their favour; but the diffi∣culty of obtaining this is so great, that we have great reason to be cautious therein. But, should it plainly appear that absolute subjection was a condition the most proper for the person who is purchased, yet the in∣nocent children ought not to be made slaves, because their parents sinned.</P>
<P>We have account in holy scripture of some families suffering, where mention is only made of the heads of the family committing wick∣edness; and it is likely that the degenerate Jews, misunderstanding some occurrences of this kind, took occasion to charge God with being unequal; so that a saying became com∣mon, <Q>The Fathers have eaten four grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.</Q> Jeremiah and Ezekiel, two of the inspired prophets, who lived near the same time, were
<PB N="283" REF="013782_0296_0F91B541B25B0978"/>
concerned to correct this error. Ezekiel is large on the subject. First, he reproves them for their error. <Q>What mean ye, that ye do so, chap. xviii. verse 2. As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have oc∣casion any more to use this proverb in Is∣rael.</Q> The words, "any more," have reference to time past; intimating, that tho' they had not rightly understood some things they had heard or seen, and thence supposed the proverb to be well grounded; yet hence∣forth they might know of a certainty, that the ways of God are all equal; that as sure as the Most High liveth, so sure men are on∣ly answerable for their own sins.—He thus sums up the matter, ver. 20. <Q>The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father; neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be up∣on him; and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</Q></P>
<P>Where men are wicked, they commonly are a means of corrupting the succeeding age; and thereby hasten those outward calamities, which fall on nations, when their iniquities are full.</P>
<P>Men may pursue means which are not a∣greeable to perfect purity, with a view to in∣crease the wealth and happiness of their off∣spring, and thereby make the way of virtue more difficult to them. And though the ill example of a parent, or a multitude, does not excuse a man in doing evil, yet the mind be∣ing
<PB N="284" REF="013782_0297_0F91B3DF623CC158"/>
early impressed with vicious notions and practices, and nurtured up in ways of get∣ting treasure, which are not the ways of truth; this wrong spirit getting first possessi∣on, and being thus strengthened, frequently prevents due attention to the true spirit of wisdom, so that they exceed in wickedness those who lived before them. And in this channel, though parents labour, as they think, to for∣ward the happiness of their children, it proves a means of forwarding their calamity. This being the case in the age next before the grievous calamity in the siege of Jerusalem, and carrying Judah captive to Babylon, they might say with propriety, This came upon us, be∣cause our fathers forsook God, and because we did worse than our fathers. See Jer. vii. 26.</P>
<P>As the generation next before them inward∣ly turned away from God, who yet waited to be gracious; and as they in that age conti∣nued in those things which necessarily sepa∣rated from perfect goodness, growing more stubborn, till the judgments of God were poured out upon them; they might properly say, <Q>Our fathers have sinned, and we have borne their iniquities:</Q> Lam. v. 7. And yet, wicked as their fathers were, had they not succeeded them in their wickedness, they had not borne their iniquities.</P>
<P>To suppose it right, that an innocent man shall at this day be excluded from the com∣mon rules of justice; be deprived of that li∣berty, which is the natural right of human creatures; and be a slave to others during
<PB N="285" REF="013782_0298_0F91B3DFA019D1B8"/>
life, on account of a sin committed by his immediate parents; or a sin committed by Ham, the son of Noah; is a supposition too gross to be admitted into the mind of any person, who sincerely desires to be governed by solid principles.</P>
<P>It is alledged, in favour of the practice, that Joshua made slaves of the Gibeonites.</P>
<P>What men do by the command of God, and what comes to pass as a consequence of their neglect, are different; such as the latter case now mentioned was.</P>
<P>It was the express command of the Almigh∣ty to Israel, concerning the inhabitants of the promised land, <Q>Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their Gods: They shall not dwell in thy land,</Q> Exod. xxiii. 32. Those Gibeonites came craftily, telling Joshua, that they were come from a far country; that their elders had sent them to make a league with the people of Israel; and as an evidence of their being foreigners, shewed their old cloaths, &amp;c. <Q>And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord; and Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live; and the princes sware to them.</Q> Josh. xcvi. 14, 15.</P>
<P>When the imposition was discovered, the congregation murmured against the princes: <Q>But all the princes said to all the congrega∣tion, we have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel; now therefore we may not touch them; we will even let them live,
<PB N="286" REF="013782_0299_0F91B3E06430C928"/>
lest wrath be upon us; but let them be hewers of wood, and drawers of water un∣to the congregation.</Q></P>
<P>Omitting to ask counsel, involved them in great difficulty. The Gibeonites were of those cities, of which the Lord said, <Q>Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth;</Q> and of the stock of the Hivites, concerning whom he commanded by name, <Q>Thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them: Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them,</Q> Deut. vii. 1. Thus Joshua and the princes, not knowing them, had made a league with them, to let them live; and in this strait they resolve to make them servants. Joshua and the princes sus∣pected them to be deceivers: <Q>Peradventure you dwell amongst us: and how shall we make a league with you?</Q> Which words shew, that they remembered the command before mentioned; and yet did not enquire at the mouth of the Lord, as Moses directed Joshua, when he gave him a charge respect∣ing his duty as chief man among that people, Numb. xxvii. 21. By this omission things became so situated, that Joshua and the princes could not execute the judgments of God on them, without violating the oath which they had made.</P>
<P>Moses did amiss at the waters of Meribah; and doubtless he soon repented; for the Lord was with him. And it is likely that Joshua was deeply humbled, under a sense of his omission; for it appears that God continued
<PB N="287" REF="013782_0300_0F91B3E1212DA318"/>
him in his office, and spared the lives of those people, for the sake of the league and oath made in his name.</P>
<P>The wickedness of these people was great, and they worthy to die, or perfect justice had not passed sentence of death upon them; and as their execution was prevented by this league and oath, they appear content to be servants: <Q>As it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</Q></P>
<P>These criminals, instead of death, had the sentence of servitude pronounced on them, in these words, <Q>Now therefore ye are cursed; and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the house of my God.</Q></P>
<P>We find, Deut. xx. 10. that there were cities far distant from Canaan, against which Israel went to battle; unto whom they were to proclaim peace, and if the inhabitants made answer of peace, and opened their gates, they were not to destroy them, but make them tributaries.</P>
<P>The children of Israel were then the Lord's host, and executioners of his judgments on people hardened in wickedness.—They were not to go to battle, but by his appointment. The men who were chief in his army, had their instructions from the Almighty; some∣times immediately, and sometimes by the ministry of angels. Of these, amongst others, were Moses, Joshua, Othniel, and Gideon; see Exod. iii. 2. and xviii. 19. Josh. v. 13.
<PB N="288" REF="013782_0301_0F91B3E1EBF38A88"/>
These people far off from Canaan, against whom Israel was sent to battle, were so cor∣rupt, that the creator of the universe saw it good to change their situation; and in case of their opening their gates, and coming un∣der tribute, this their subjection, though pro∣bably more mild than absolute slavery, was to last little or no longer than while Israel re∣mained in the true spirit of government.</P>
<P>It was pronounced by Moses the prophet, as a consequence of their wickedness, <Q>The stranger that is within thee shall get above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low: he shall be the head, and thou the tail.</Q> Deut. xxviii. 43, 44.</P>
<P>This we find in some measure verified in their being made tributaries to the Moabites, Midianites, Amorites and Philistines.</P>
<P>It is alledged in favour of the practice of slave-keeping, that the Jews by their law made slaves of the Heathen, Levit. xxv. 45. <Q>Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn amongst you, of them shall ye buy, and of their children, which are with you, which they begat in your land; and they shall be your possession; and you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them as a possession, they shall be your bondmen for ever.</Q>—It is difficult for us to have any certain knowledge of the mind of Moses, in regard to keeping slaves, any other way than by looking upon him as a true servant of God, whose mind and conduct were regulated by
<PB N="289" REF="013782_0302_0F91B3E2C1E1FEA0"/>
an inward principle of justice and equity. To admit a supposition that he in that case was drawn from perfect equity by the alliance of outward kindred, would be to disown his au∣thority.</P>
<P>Abraham had servants born in his house, and bought with his money: <Q>And the Al∣mighty said of Abraham, I know him, that he will order his house after him.</Q> Which implies, that he was as a father, an instructor, and a good governor over his peo∣ple.—And Moses, considered as a man of God, must necessarily have had a prospect of some real advantage in the strangers and hea∣thens being servants to the Israelites for a time.</P>
<P>As mankind had received and established many erroneous opinions and hurtful cus∣toms, their living and conversing with the Jews, while the Jews stood faithful to their principles, might be helpful to remove those errors, and reform their manners.—But for men, with private views, to assume an absolute power over the persons and proper∣ties of others; and continue it from age to age in the line of natural generation, with∣out regard to the virtues and vices of their successors, as it is manifestly contrary to true universal love, and attended with great evils, there requires the clearest evidence to beget a belief in us, that Moses intended that the strangers should as such be slaves to the Jews.</P>
<P>He directed them to buy strangers and so∣journers.—It appears that there were strang∣ers
<PB N="290" REF="013782_0303_0F91B3E3604978F0"/>
in Israel who were free men; and consi∣dering with what tenderness and humanity the Jews, by their law, were obliged to use their servants, and what care was to be taken to instruct them in the true religion, it is not unlikely that some strangers in poverty and distress were willing to enter into bonds to serve the Jews as long as they lived; and in such case the Jews, by their law, had a right to their service during life.</P>
<P>When the awl was bored through the ear of the Hebrew servant, the text saith, <Q>He shall serve for ever;</Q> yet we do not sup∣pose that by the word "for ever," it was in∣tended that none of his posterity should af∣terwards be free; when it is said in regard to the strangers which they bought, <Q>They shall be your possession,</Q> it may be well understood to mean only the persons so pur∣chased; all preceding relates to buying them; and what follows, to the continuance of their service, <Q>You shall take them as an inhe∣ritance to your children after you; they shall be your bondmen for ever.</Q> It may be well understood to stand limited to those they purchased.</P>
<P>Moses, directing Aaron and his sons to wash their hands and feet, when they went into the tabernacle of the congregation, saith, <Q>It shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and his seed throughout all gene∣rations.</Q> And to express the continuance of the law, it was his common language, <Q>It shall be a statute for ever throughout
<PB N="291" REF="013782_0304_0F91B3E421208F70"/>
your generations.</Q> So that had he intend∣ed the posterity of the strangers so purchased to continue in slavery to the Jews, it looks likely that he would have used some terms clearly to express it. The Jews undoubtedly had slaves, whom they kept as such from one age to another; but that this was agreeable to the genuine design of their inspired law∣giver, is far from being a clear case.</P>
<P>Making constructions of the law contrary to the true meaning of it, was common a∣mongst that people.—Samuel's sons took bribes, and perverted judgment.—Isaiah complained that they justified the wicked for reward.—Zephaniah, cotemporary with Jeremiah, on account of the injustice of the civil magistrates, declared that those judges were evening wolves; and that the priests did violence to the law.</P>
<P>Jeremiah acquaints us, that the priests cried peace, peace, when there was no peace; by which means the people grew bold in their wickedness; and having committed a∣bominations, were not ashamed; but, thro' wrong constructions of the law, they justifi∣ed themselves, and boastingly said <Q>We are wise; and the law of the Lord is with us.</Q> These corruptions continued till the days of our Saviour, who told the Pharisees, <Q>You have made the commandment of God of none effect through your tradition.</Q></P>
<P>Thus it appears that they corrupted the law of Moses; nor is it unlikely that among many others this was one; for oppressing the
<PB N="292" REF="013782_0305_0F91B3E587A25498"/>
strangers was a heavy charge against the Jews, and very often strongly represented by the Lord's faithful prophets.</P>
<P>That the liberty of man was, by the in∣spired law-giver, esteemed precious, appears in this; that such who unjustly deprived men of it, were to be punished in like man∣ner as if they had murdered them. <Q>He that stealeth a man, and selleth him; or if he be found in his hand, shall surely be put to death.</Q> This part of the law was so considerable, that Paul, the learned Jew, giving a brief account of the uses of the law, adds this, "It was made for men-stealers," 1 Tim. i. 10.</P>
<P>The great men amongst that people were exceeding oppressive; and, it is likely, ex∣erted their whole strength and influence to have the law construed to suit their turns.—The honest servants of the lord had heavy work with them in regard to their oppressi∣on; a few instances follow. <Q>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, a∣mend your ways, and your doings; and I will cause you to dwell in this place. If you throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; if you oppress not the stranger, the fatherless and the wi∣dow; and shed not innocent blood in this place; neither walk after other gods to your hurt, then will I cause you to dwell in this place,</Q> Jer. vii—Again a mes∣sage was sent not only to the inferior mini∣sters of justice, but also to the chief ruler.

<Q>Thus saith the Lord, go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word; execute ye judgment and righteous∣ness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor; and do no wrong; do no violence to the stranger, the father∣less and the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place. Then adds, That in so doing they should prosper; but if ye will not hear these words, I swear by my∣self, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a desolation,</Q> Jer. xxii.</P>
<P>The king, the princes and rulers were a∣greed in oppression before the Babylonish captivity; for whatever courts of justice were retained amongst them; or however they de∣cided matters betwixt men of estates, it is plain that the cause of the poor was not judg∣ed in equity.</P>
<P>It appears that the great men amongst the Jews were fully resolved to have slaves, even of their own brethren, Jer. xxxiv. Notwith∣standing the promises and threatenings of the Lord, by the prophet, and their solemn co∣venant to set them free, confirmed by the imprecation of passing between the parts of a calf cut in twain; intimating, by that cere∣mony, that on breach of the covenant, it were just for their bodies to be so cut in pieces.—Yet after all, they held fast to their old custom, and called home the servants whom they had set free.—<Q>And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to
<PB N="294" REF="013782_0307_0F91B3E81C6BA668"/>
his neighbour; and ye had made a cove∣nant before me, in the house which is call∣ed by my name; but ye turned, and pol∣luted my name, and caused every man his servant, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them in∣to subjection, to be unto you for servants, and for handmaids: therefore thus saith the Lord, ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother. Behold, I proclaim liberty to you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.—The men who transgressed my co∣venant which they made, and passed be∣tween the parts of the calf, I will give in∣to the hands of their enemies, and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth.</Q></P>
<P>Soon after this their city was taken and burnt; the king's sons and the princes slain; and the king, with the chief men of his king∣dom, carried captive to Babylon.—Ezekiel, prophesying the return of that people to their own land, directs, <Q>Ye shall divide the land by lot, for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn amongst you; in what tribe the stranger sojourns, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord God.</Q> Nor is this particu∣lar direction, and the authority with which
<PB N="295" REF="013782_0308_0F91B3EA141A4D20"/>
it is enforced, without a tacit implication, that their ancestors had erred in their conduct towards the stranger.</P>
<P>Some who keep slaves, have doubted as to the equity of the practice; but as they knew men, noted for their piety, who were in it, this, they say, has made their minds easy.</P>
<P>To lean on the example of men in doubt∣ful cases, is difficult: for only admit, that those men were not faithful and upright to the highest degree, but that in some particu∣lar case they erred, and it may follow that this one case was the same, about which we are in doubt; and to quiet our minds by their example, may be dangerous to our∣selves; and continuing in it, prove a stum∣bling block to tender-minded people who succeed us, in like manner as their examples are to us.</P>
<P>But supposing charity was their only mo∣tive, and they not foreseeing the tendency of paying robbers for their booty, were not just∣ly under the imputation of being partners with a thief, Prov. xxix. 24. but were really innocent in what they did, are we assured that we keep them with the same views they kept them? If we keep them from no other motive than a real sense of duty, and true charity governs us in all our proceedings to∣ward them, we are so far safe: but if another spirit, which inclines our minds to the ways of this world, prevail upon us, and we are concerned for our own outward gain more than for their real happiness, it will avail us
<PB N="296" REF="013782_0309_0F91B3EA31C24800"/>
nothing that some good men have had the care and management of Negroes.</P>
<P>Since mankind spread upon the earth, ma∣ny have been the revolutions attending the several families, and their customs and ways of life different from each other. This di∣versity of manners, though some are prefer∣able to others, operates not in favour of any, so far as to justify them to do violence to in∣nocent men; to bring them from their own to another way of life. The mind, when moved by a principle of true love, may feel a warmth of gratitude to the universal father, and a lively sympathy with those nations, where divine Light has been less manifest.</P>
<P>This desire for their real good may beget a willingness to undergo hardships for their sakes, that the true knowledge of God may be spread amongst them: but to take them from their own land, with views of profit to ourselves, by means inconsistent with pure justice, is foreign to that principle which seeks the happiness of the whole creation. Forced subjection, of innocent persons of full age, is inconsistent with right reason; on one side, the human mind is not naturally forti∣fied with that firmness in wisdom and good∣ness, necessary to an independant ruler; on the other side, to be subject to the uncon∣troulable will of a man, liable to err, is most painful and afflicting to a conscientious crea∣ture.</P>
<P>It is our happiness faithfully to serve the divine Being, who made us; his perfection
<PB N="297" REF="013782_0310_0F91B3EADC4C8990"/>
makes our service reasonable; but so long as men are biassed by narrow self-love, so long an absolute power over other men is unfit for them.</P>
<P>Men, taking on them the government of others, may intend to govern reasonably, and make their subjects more happy than they would be otherwise; but, as absolute com∣mand belongs only to him who is perfect, where frail men, in their own wills, assume such command, it hath a direct tendency to vitiate their minds, and make them more unfit for government.</P>
<P>Placing on men the ignominious title SLAVE, dressing them in uncomely gar∣ments, keeping them to servile labour, in which they are often dirty, tends gradually to fix a notion in the mind, that they are a sort of people below us in nature, and leads us to consider them as such in all our con∣clusions about them. And, moreover, a person which in our esteem is mean and con∣temptible, if their language or behaviour toward us is unseemly or disrespectful, it ex∣cites wrath more powerfully than the like conduct in one we accounted our equal or superior; and where this happens to be the case, it disqualifies for candid judgment; for it is unfit for a person to sit as judge in a case where his own personal resentments are stirr∣ed up; and, as members of society in a well framed government, we are mutually depen∣dent. Present interest incites to duty, and makes each man attentive to the conveni∣ence
<PB N="298" REF="013782_0311_0F91B3EC466ADE38"/>
of others; but he whose will is a law to others, and can enforce obedience by punish∣ment; be whose wants are supplied without feeling any obligation to make equal returns to his benefactor, his irregular appetites find an open field for motion, and he is in dan∣ger of growing hard, and inattentive to their convenience who labour for his support; and so loses that disposition, in which alone men are fit to govern.</P>
<P>The English government hath been com∣mended by candid foreigners for the disuse of racks and tortures, so much practised in some states; but this multiplying slaves now leads to it; for where people exact hard la∣bour of others, without a suitable reward, and are resolved to continue in that way, se∣verity to such who oppose them becomes the consequence; and several Negroe criminals, among the English in America, have been executed in a lingering, painful way, very terrifying to others.</P>
<P>It is a happy case to set out right, and per∣severe in the same way: a wrong beginning leads into many difficulties; for to support one evil, another becomes customary; two produces more; and the further men proceed in this way, the greater their dangers, their doubts and fears, and the more painful and perplexing are their circumstances; so that such who are true friends to the real and last∣ing interest of our country, and candidly consider the tendency of things, cannot but feel some concern on this account.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="013782_0312_0F91B3EC63ABFD10"/>
There is that superiority in men over the brute creatures, and some of them so mani∣festly dependent on men for a living, that for them to serve us in moderation, so far as re∣lates to the right use of things, looks conso∣nant to the design of our Creator.</P>
<P>There is nothing in their frame, nothing relative to the propagating their species, which argues the contrary; but in men there is. The frame of men's bodies, and the disposi∣tion of their minds are different; some, who are tough and strong, and their minds active, chuse ways of life requiring much labour to support them; others are soon weary; and though use makes labour more tolerable, yet some are less apt for toil than others, and their minds less sprightly. These latter la∣bouring for their subsistence, commonly chuse a life easy to support, being content with a little. When they are weary they may rest, take the most advantageous part of the day for labour; and in all cases proportion one thing to another, that their bodies be not oppressed.</P>
<P>Now, while each is at liberty, the latter may be as happy, and live as comfortably as the former; but where men of the first sort have the latter under absolute command, not considering the odds in strength and firm∣ness, do sometimes, in their eager pursuit, lay on burthens grievous to be borne; by de∣grees grow rigorous, and, aspiring to great∣ness, they increase oppression, and the true order of kind Providence is subverted.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="013782_0313_0F91B3ED749C52A0"/>
There are weaknesses sometimes attending us, which make little or no alteration in our countenances, nor much lessen our appetite for food, and yet so affect us, as to make la∣bour very uneasy. In such case masters, in∣tent on putting forward business, and jealous of the sincerity of their slaves, may disbelieve what they say, and grievously afflict them.</P>
<P>Action is necessary for all men, and our exhausting frame requires a support, which is the fruit of action. The earth must be laboured to keep us alive: labour is a proper part of our life; to make one answer the o∣ther in some useful motion, looks agreeable to the design of our Creator. Motion, right∣ly managed, tends to our satisfaction, health and support.</P>
<P>Those who quit all useful business, and live wholly on the labour of others, have their exercise to seek; some such use less than their health requires; others chuse that which, by the circumstances attending it, proves utter∣ly reverse to true happiness. Thus, while some are divers ways distressed for want of an open channel of useful action, those who support them sigh, and are exhausted in a stream too powerful for nature, spending their days with too little cessation from labour.</P>
<P>Seed sown with the tears of a confined op∣pressed people, harvest cut down by an over∣borne discontented reaper, makes bread less sweet to the taste of an honest man, than that which is the produce, or just reward of
<PB N="301" REF="013782_0314_0F91B3EDF9E8D058"/>
such voluntary action, which is one proper part of the business of human creatures.</P>
<P>Again, the weak state of the human spe∣cies, in bearing and bringing forth their young, and the helpless condition of their young beyond that of other creatures, clearly shew that Perfect Goodness designs a tender care and regard should be exercised toward them; and that no imperfect, arbitrary pow∣er should prevent the cordial effects of that sympathy, which is, in the minds of well-met pairs, to each other, and toward their offspring.</P>
<P>In our species the mutual ties of affection are more rational and durable than in others below us; the care and labour of raising our offspring much greater. The satisfaction a∣rising to us in their innocent company, and in their advances from one rational improve∣ment to another, is considerable, when two are thus joined, and their affections sincere. It however happens among slaves, that they are often situate in different places; and their seeing each other depends on the will of men, liable to human passions, and a bias in judg∣ment; who, with views of self-interest, may keep them apart more than is right. Being absent from each other, and often with other company, there is a danger of their affections being alienated, jealousies arising, the hap∣piness otherwise resulting from their offspring frustrated, and the comforts of marriage de∣stroyed.—These things being considered close∣ly,
<PB N="302" REF="013782_0315_0F91B3EEAC366F88"/>
as happening to a near friend, will ap∣pear to be hard and painful.</P>
<P>He who reverently observes that goodness manifested by our gracious Creator toward the various species of beings in this world, will see, that in our frame and constitution is clearly shewn that innocent men, capable to manage for themselves, were not intended to be slaves.</P>
<P>A person lately travelling amongst the Ne∣groes near Senegal, hath this remark; <Q>Which way soever I turned my eyes on this pleasant spot, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature; an agreeable solitude, bounded on every side by charming land-skips, the rural situation of cottages in the midst of trees. The ease and indolence of the Negroes reclined under the shade of their spreading foliage; the simplicity of their dress and manners; the whole reviv∣ed in my mind the idea of our first parents, and I seemed to contemplate the world in its primitive state.</Q> M. Adanson, page 55.</P>
<P>Some Negroes in these parts, who have had an agreeable education, have manifested a brightness of understanding equal to many of us. A remark of this kind we find in Bos∣man, page 328. <Q>The Negroes of Fida, saith he, are so accurately quick in their merchandize accounts, that they easily reckon as justly and quickly in their heads only, as we with the assistance of pen and ink, though the sum amounts to several thousands.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="013782_0316_0F91B3EF6462F4E8"/>
Through the force of long custom, it ap∣pears needful to speak in relation to colour.—Suppose a white child, born of parents of the meanest sort, who died and left him an in∣fant, falls into the hands of a person, who endeavours to keep him a slave, some men would account him an unjust man in doing so, who yet appear easy while many black people, of honest lives, and good abilities, are enslaved, in a manner more shocking than the case here supposed. This is owing chiefly to the idea of slavery being connected with the black colour, and liberty with the white:—and where false ideas are twisted in∣to our minds, it is with difficulty we get fairly disentangled.</P>
<P>A traveller, in cloudy weather, misseth his way, makes many turns while he is lost; still forms in his mind, the bearing and situation of places, and though the ideas are wrong, they fix as fast as if they were right. Find∣ing how things are, we see our mistake; yet the force of reason, with repeated observati∣ons on places and things, do not soon remove those false notions, so fastened upon us, but it will seem in the imagination as if the an∣nual course of the sun was altered; and though, by recollection, we are assured it is not, yet those ideas do not suddenly leave us.</P>
<P>Selfishness being indulged, clouds the un∣derstanding; and where selfish men, for a long time, proceed on their way, without opposition, the deceiveableness of unrighte∣ousness gets so rooted in their intellects, that
<PB N="304" REF="013782_0317_0F91B3F023155E78"/>
a candid examination of things relating to self-interest is prevented; and in this cir∣cumstance, some who would not agree to make a slave of a person whose colour is like their own, appear easy in making slaves of others of a different colour, though their un∣derstandings and morals are equal to the ge∣nerality of men of their own colour.</P>
<P>The colour of a man avails nothing, in matters of right and equity. Consider co∣lour in relation to treaties; by such, disputes betwixt nations are sometimes settled. And should the father of us all so dispose things, that treaties with black men should sometimes be necessary, how then would it appear a∣mongst the princes and ambassadors, to insist on the prerogative of the white colour?</P>
<P>Whence is it that men, who believe in a righteous omnipotent Being, to whom all nations stand equally related, and are equal∣ly accountable, remain so easy in it; but for that the ideas of Negroes and slaves are so interwoven in the mind, that they do not discuss this matter with that candour and freedom of thought, which the case justly calls for?</P>
<P>To come at a right feeling of their condi∣tion, requires humble serious thinking; for, in their present situation, they have but little to engage our natural affection in their fa∣vour.</P>
<P>Had we a son or a daughter involved in the same case, in which many of them are, it would alarm us, and make us feel their con∣dition
<PB N="305" REF="013782_0318_0F91B3F0E1170608"/>
without seeking for it. The adversity of an intimate friend will incite our compas∣sion, while others, equally good, in the like trouble, will but little affect us.</P>
<P>Again, the man in worldly honour, whom we consider as our superior, treating us with kindness and generosity, begets a return of gratitude and friendship toward him. We may receive as great benefits from men a de∣gree lower than ourselves, in the common way of reckoning, and feel ourselves less engaged in favour of them. Such is our condition by nature; and these things be∣ing narrowly watched and examined, will be found to center in self-love.</P>
<P>The blacks seem far from being our kins∣folks, and did we find an agreeable dispositi∣on and sound understanding in some of them, which appeared as a good foundation for a true friendship between us, the disgrace aris∣ing from an open friendship with a person of so vile a stock, in the common esteem, would naturally tend to hinder it.—They have nei∣ther honours, riches, outward magnificence nor power; their dress coarse, and often rag∣ged; their employ drudgery, and much in the dirt: they have little or nothing at com∣mand; but must wait upon and work for o∣thers, to obtain the necessaries of life; so that, in their present situation, there is not much to engage the friendship, or move the affection of selfish men: but such who live in the spirit of true charity, to sympathise with
<PB N="306" REF="013782_0319_0F91B3F1BB2E7788"/>
the afflicted in the lowest stations of life, is a thing familiar to them.</P>
<P>Such is the kindness of our Creator, that people, applying their minds to sound wis∣dom, may, in general, with moderate exer∣cise, live comfortably, where no misapplied power hinders it.—We in these parts have cause gratefully to acknowledge it. But men leaving the true use of things, their lives are less calm, and have less of real happiness in them.</P>
<P>Many are desirous of purchasing and keep∣ing slaves, that they may live in some mea∣sure conformable to those customs of the times, which have in them a tincture of lux∣ury; for when we, in the least degree, de∣part from that use of the creatures, for which the Creator of all things intended them, there luxury begins.</P>
<P>And if we consider this way of life seri∣ously, we shall see there is nothing in it suf∣ficient to induce a wise man to chuse it, be∣fore a plain, simple way of living. If we examine stately buildings and equipage, de∣licious food, superfine cloaths, silks and linens; if we consider the splendour of choice metal fastened upon raiment, and the most showy inventions of men; it will yet appear that the humble-minded man, who is con∣tented with the true use of houses, food and garments, and chearfully exerciseth himself agreeable to his station in civil society, to earn them, acts more reasonably, and dis∣covers
<PB N="307" REF="013782_0320_0F91B3F3B389F458"/>
more soundness of understanding in his conduct, than such who lay heavy bur∣dens on others, to support themselves in a luxurious way of living.</P>
<P>George Buchanan, in his history of Scot∣land, page 62, tells of some ancient inhabi∣tants of Britain, who were derived from a people that "had a way of marking their bodies, as some said, with instruments of iron, with variety of pictures, and with ani∣mals of all shapes, and wear no garments, that they should not hide their pictures; and were therefore called Picts."</P>
<P>Did we see those people shrink with pain, for a considerable time together, under the point or edge of this iron instrument, and their bodies all bloody with the operation; did we see them sometimes naked, suffering with cold, and refuse to put on garments, that those imaginary ensigns of grandeur might not be concealed, it is likely we should pity their folly, and fondness for those things: but if we candidly compare their conduct, in that case, with some conduct amongst ourselves, will it not appear that our folly is the greatest?</P>
<P>In true gospel simplicity, free from all wrong use of things, a spirit which breathes peace and good will is cherished; but when we aspire after imaginary grandeur, and ap∣ply to selfish means to attain our end, this desire, in its original, is the same with the Picts in cutting figures on their bodies; but
<PB N="308" REF="013782_0321_0F91B3F3F3EA67C0"/>
the evil consequences attending our proceed∣ings are the greatest.</P>
<P>A covetous mind, which seeks opportuni∣ty to exalt itself, is a great enemy to true harmony in a country: envy and grudging usually accompany this disposition, and it tends to stir up its likeness in others. And where this disposition ariseth so high, as to embolden us to look upon honest industrious men as our own property during life, and to keep them to hard labour, to support us in those customs which have not their founda∣tion in right reason; or to use any means of oppression; a haughty spirit is cherished on one side, and the desire of revenge frequent∣ly on the other, till the inhabitants of the land are ripe for great commotion and trou∣ble; and thus luxury and oppression have the seeds of war and desolation in them.</P>

<P>BOSMAN on Guinea, who was a factor for the Dutch about sixteen years in that country, (page 339) thus remarks: <Q>But since I have so often mentioned that com∣merce, I shall describe how it is managed by our factors. The first business of one
<PB N="309" REF="013782_0322_0F91B3F4AE57D4A0"/>
of our factors, when he comes to Fida, is to satisfy the customs of the king, and the great men, which amounts to about one hundred pounds, in Guinea value, as the goods must sell there. After which we have free licence to trade, which is pub∣lished throughout the whole land by the cryer. And yet before we can deal with any person, we are obliged to buy the king's whole stock of slaves, at a set price; which is commonly one third or fourth higher than ordinary. After which, we have free leave to deal with all his subjects, of what rank soever. But if there happen to be no stock of slaves, the factor must resolve to run the risk of trusting the in∣habitants with goods, to the value of one or two hundred slaves; which commodi∣ties they send into the inland country, in order to buy with them slaves at all mar∣kets, and that sometimes two hundred miles deep in the country: for you ought to be informed, that markets of men are here kept in the same manner as they of beasts are with us.</Q></P>
<Q><P>Most of the slaves which are offered to us, are prisoners of war, which are sold by the victors as their booty.—When these slaves come to Fida, they are put in prisons all together; and when we treat concerning them, they are all brought out in a large plain, where, by our surgeons, whose province it is, they are thoroughly examined, even to the smallest member,

and that naked, both men and women, without the least distinction or modesty. Those which are approved as good, are set on one side. The invalids and maimed being thrown out, the remainder are num∣bered, and it is entered who delivered them: in the mean while a burning iron, with the arms or name of the company, lies in the fire, with which ours are mark∣ed on the breast. This is done, that we may distinguish them from the slaves of the English, French, or others. When we have agreed with the owners of the slaves, they are returned to their prisons, where, from that time forward, they are kept at our charge, cost us two-pence a day a slave, which serves to subsist them, like our criminals, on bread and water: so that, to save charges, we send them on board our ships the first opportunity; be∣fore which their masters strip them of all they have on their backs, so that they come aboard stark naked, as well women as men; in which condition they are o∣bliged to continue, if the master of the ship is not so charitable (which he com∣monly is) as to bestow something on them, to cover their nakedness.</P>

They tell us, they live in peace with all their neighbours, and have no notion of any other enemy than the English; of which nation they had taken some then: and publickly declared, that they would en∣deavour to get as many of them, as the two mentioned ships had carried off of their natives.

<HEAD>EXTRACTS from a Collection of VOYAGES. Vol. 1.</HEAD>
<P>THE author, a popish missionary, speak∣ing of his departing from the Negroe country to Brazil, faith, "I remember the duke of Bambay (a Negroe chief) one day sent me several blacks, to be my slaves, which I would not accept of; but sent them back to him. I afterwards told him, I came not into his country to make slaves; but rather to deliver those from the slavery of the devil, whom he kept in miserable thraldom. The ship I went aboard was loaded with elephants teeth, and slaves, to the number of six hun∣dred and eighty men, women and children. It was a pitiful sight to behold how all these people were bestowed. The men were stand∣ing in the hold, fastened one to another with stakes, for fear they should rise and kill the whites: the women were between the decks, and those that were with child in the great cabbin: the children in the steerage, pressed together like herrings in a barrel; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h caused an intolerable heat and stench." Page 507.</P>
<P>"It is now time (saith the same author) to speak of a brutish custom these people have amongst them in making slaves; which I take not to be lawful for any person of a good conscience to buy."—</P>
<P>He then describes how women betray m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n into slavery, and adds, "There are others going up into the inland country, and, thro'

pretence of jurisdiction, seize men upon any trifling offence, and sell them for slaves." Page 537.</P>
<P>The author of this treatise, conversing with a person of good credit, was informed by him, that in his youth, while in England, he was minded to come to America, and happening on a vessel bound for Guinea, and from thence into America, he, with a view to see Africa, went on board her, and continued with them in their voyage, and so came into this country. Among other circumstances he related these. "They purchased on the coast about three hundred slaves; some of them he understood were captives of war; some stolen by other Negroes privately.—When they had got many slaves on board, but were still on that coast, a plot was laid by an old Negroe, notwithstanding the men had irons on their hands and feet, to kill the English and take the vessel; which being dis∣covered, the man was hanged, and many of the slaves made to shoot at him as he hung up."</P>
<P>"Another slave was charged with having a design to kill the English; and the captain spoke to him in relation to the charge brought against him, as he stood on deck; whereup∣on he immediately threw himself into the sea, and was drowned."</P>
<P>"Several Negroes, confined on board, were, he said, so extremely uneasy with their con∣dition, that after many endeavours used, they could never make them eat nor drink
<PB N="314" REF="013782_0327_0F91B3F869E68060"/>
after they came in the vessel; but in a despe∣rate resolution starved themselves to death, behaving toward the last like mad-men."</P>
<P>In Randall's geography, printed 1744, we are informed, "That in a time of full peace nothing is more common than for the Negroes of one nation to steal those of another, and sell them to the Europeans. It is thought that the English transmit annually near fifty thousand of these unhappy creatures; and the other European nations together, about two hundred thousand more."</P>
<P>It is through the goodness of God that the reformation from gross idolatry and barbari∣ty hath been thus far effected; if we consi∣der our conditions as christians, and the be∣nefits we enjoy, and compare them with the condition of those people, and consider that our nation trading with them for their coun∣try produce, have had an opportunity of im∣parting useful instructions to them, and re∣member that but little pains have been taken therein, it must look like an indifference in us.—But when we reflect on a custom the most shocking of any amongst them, and re∣member <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat, with a view to outward gain, we have joined as parties in it; that our con∣currence with them in their barbarous pro∣ceedings, had tended to harden them in cru∣elty, and been a means of increasing calami∣ties in their country, we must own that herein we have acted contrary to those wor∣thies whose lives and substance were spent in propagating truth and righteousness amongst

the heathen. When Saul, by the hand of Doeg, slew four score priests at once, he had a jealousy that one of them at least was con∣federate with David, whom he considered as his enemy.—Herod slaying all the male children in Bethlehem of two years old and under, was an act of uncommon cruelty; but he supposed there was a male child there, within that age, who was likely to be king of the Jews, and finding no way to destroy him, but by destroying them all, thought this the most effectual means to secure the kingdom to his own family.</P>
<P>When the sentence against the protestants of Marindol, &amp;c. in France, was put in ex∣ecution, great numbers of people fled to the wilderness; amongst whom were ancient people, women great with child, and others with babes in their arms, who endured cala∣mities grievous to relate, and in the end some perished with hunger, and many were de∣stroyed by fire and sword; but they had this objection against them, That they obstinately persisted in opposition to holy mother church, and being hereticks, it was right to work their ruin and extirpation, and raze out their memory from among men. Fox's Acts and Monuments, page 646.</P>
<P>In favour of those cruelties, every one had what they deemed a plea.—These scenes of blood and cruelty among the barbarous in∣habitants of Guinea, are not less terrible than those now mentioned. They are con∣tinued from one age to another, and we make
<PB N="316" REF="013782_0329_0F91B3FC78FF6288"/>
ourselves parties and fellow-helpers in them; nor do I see that we have any plea in our fa∣vour more plausible than the plea of Saul, of Herod, or the French in those slaughters.</P>
<P>Many who are parties in this trade, by keeping slaves with views of self-interest, were they to go as soldiers in one of these in∣land expeditions to catch slaves, they must necessarily grow dissatisfied with such em∣ploy, or cease to profess their religious prin∣ciples. And though the first and most strik∣ing part of the scene is done at a great dis∣tance, and by other hands, yet every one who is acquainted with the circumstances, and notwithstanding joins in it for the sake of gain only, must, in the nature of things, be chargeable with the others.</P>
<P>Should we consider ourselves present as spectators, when cruel Negroes privately catch innocent children, who are employed in the fields; hear their lamentable cries, under the most terrifying apprehensions; or should we look upon it as happening in our own families, having our children carried off by savages, we must needs own, that such proceedings are contrary to the nature of christianity; should we meditate on the wars which are greatly increased by this trade, and on that affliction which many thousands live in, through apprehensions of being taken or slain; on the terror and a∣mazement that villages are in, when sur∣rounded by these troops of enterprisers; on the great pain and misery of groaning dying
<PB N="317" REF="013782_0330_0F91B3FCF00BA308"/>
men, who get wounded in those skirmishes; we shall necessarily see, that it is impossible to be parties in such a trade, on the motives of gain, and retain our innocence.</P>
<P>Should we consider the case of multitudes of those people, who in a fruitful soil, and hot climate, with a little labour, raise grain, roots and pulse to eat; spin and weave cot∣ton, and fasten together the large feathers of fowls, to cover their nakedness; many of whom, in much simplicity, live inoffensively in their cottages, and take great comfort in raising up children.</P>
<P>Should we contemplate on their circum∣stances, when suddenly attacked, and labour to understand their inexpressible anguish of soul, who survive the conflict; should we think on inoffensive women, who fled at the alarm, and at their return saw that village, in which they and their acquaintance were raised up, and had pleasantly spent their youthful days, now lying in a gloomy deso∣lation; some shocked at finding the mangled bodies of their near friends amongst the slain; others bemoaning the absence of a brother, a sister, a child, or a whole family of children, who, by cruel men, are bound and carried to market, to be sold, without the least hopes of seeing them again: add to this, the af∣flicted condition of these poor captives, who are separated from family connections, and all the comforts arising from friendship and acquaintance, carried amongst a people of a strange language, to be parted from their
<PB N="318" REF="013782_0331_0F91B3FEE54E79E0"/>
fellow captives, put to labour in a manner more servile and wearisome than what they were used to, with many sorrowful circum∣stances attending their slavery; and we must necessarily see, that it belongs not to the fol∣lowers of Christ to be parties in such a trade, on the motives of outward gain.</P>
<P>Though there were wars and desolation a∣mong the Negroes, before the Europeans be∣gan to trade there for slaves, yet now the ca∣lamities are greatly increased, so many thou∣sands being annually brought from thence; and we, by purchasing them, with views of self-interest, are become parties with them, and accessary to that increase.</P>
<P>In this case, we are not joining against an enemy who is fomenting discords on our con∣tinent, and using all possible means to make slaves of us and our children; but against a people who have not injured us.</P>
<P>If those who were spoiled and wronged, should at length make slaves of their oppres∣sors, and continue slavery to their posterity, it would look rigorous to candid men: but to act that part toward a people, when nei∣ther they nor their fathers have injured us, hath something in it extraordinary, and re∣quires our serious attention.</P>
<P>Our children breaking a bone; getting so bruised, that a leg or an arm must be taken off; lost for a few hours, so that we despair of their being found again; a friend hurt, so that he dieth in a day or two; these move us with grief: and did we attend to these
<PB N="319" REF="013782_0332_0F91B40010563C58"/>
scenes in Africa, in like manner as if they were transacted in our presence; and sympa∣thise with the Negroes, in all their afflictions and miseries, as we do with our children or friends: we should be more careful to do no∣thing in any degree helping forward a trade productive of so many, and so great calami∣ties. Great distance makes nothing in our favour.—To willingly join with unrighte∣ousness, to the injury of men who live some thousand miles off, is the same in substance, as joining with it to the injury of our neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>In the eye of pure justice, actions are re∣garded according to the spirit and disposition they arise from: some evils are accounted scandalous, and the desire of reputation may keep selfish men from appearing openly in them; but he who is shy on that account, and yet by indirect means promotes that evil, and shares in the profit of it, cannot be innocent.</P>
<P>He who, with a view to self-interest, buys a slave, made so by violence, and only on the strength of such purchase holds him a slave, thereby joins hands with those who commit∣ted that violence, and in the nature of things becomes chargeable with the guilt.</P>
<P>Suppose a man wants a slave, and being in Guinea, goes and hides by the path where boys pass from one little town to another, and there catches one the day he expects to sail; and taking him on board, brings him home, without any aggravating circumstances. Sup∣pose
<PB N="320" REF="013782_0333_0F91B4009EE3EDB0"/>
another buys a man, taken by them who live by plunder and the slave-trade: they often steal them privately, and often shed much blood in getting them. He who buys the slaves thus taken, pays those men for their wickedness, and makes himself party with them.</P>
<P>Whatever nicety of distinction there may be, betwixt going in person on expeditions to catch slaves, and buying those, with a view to self-interest, which others have taken; it is clear and plain to an upright mind, that such distinction is in words, not in substance; for the parties are concerned in the same work, and have a necessary connection with, and dependance on, each other; for were there none to purchase slaves, they who live by stealing and selling them, would of con∣sequence do less at it.</P>
<P>Some would buy a Negroe brought from Guinea, with a view to self-interest, and keep him a slave, who yet would seem to scruple to take arms, and join with men em∣ployed in taking slaves.</P>
<P>Others have civil Negroes, who were born in our country, capable and likely to ma∣nage well for themselves; whom they keep as slaves, without ever trying them with freedom, and take the profit of their labour as a part of their estates, and yet disap∣prove bringing them from their own coun∣try.</P>
<P>If those Negroes had come here, as mer∣chants, with their ivory and gold dust, in
<PB N="321" REF="013782_0334_0F91B40173BC3788"/>
order to trade with us, and some powerful person had took their effects to himself, and then put them to hard labour, and ever after considered them as slaves, the action would be looked upon as unrighteous.</P>
<P>Those Negroe merchants having children after their being among us, whose endow∣ments and conduct were like other people's in common, if on their attaining to mature age, and requesting to have their liberty, they should be told they were born in slavery, and were lawful slaves, and therefore their request should be denied; such conduct to∣ward them, would be looked upon as unfair and oppressive.</P>
<P>In the present case, relating to home-born Negroes, whose understandings and behaviour are as good as common among other people, if we have any claim to them as slaves, that claim is grounded on their being the chil∣dren or offspring of slaves, who, in general, were made such through means as unrighte∣ous, and attended with more terrible circum∣stances than the case last supposed; so that when we trace our claim to the bottom, these home-born Negroes having paid for their education, and given reasonable security to those who owned them, in case of their be∣coming chargeable, we have no more equit∣able right to their service, than we should if they were the children of honest merchants who came from Guinea in an English vessel to trade with us.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="013782_0335_0F91B402492EFB90"/>
If we claim any right to them as the chil∣dren of slaves, we build on the foundation laid by them, who made slaves of their an∣cestors; so that of necessity we must either justify the trade, or relinquish our right to them, as being the children of slaves.</P>
<P>Why should it seem right to honest men to make advantage by these people more than by others? Others enjoy freedom, receive wages equal to their work, at or near such time as they have discharged these equitable obligations they are under to those who edu∣cated them.—These have made no contract to serve; been no more expensive in raising up than others, and many of them appear as likely to make a right use of freedom as o∣ther people; which way then can an honest man withhold from them that liberty, which is the free gift of the Most High to his rati∣onal creatures?</P>
<P>THE upright in heart cannot succeed the wicked in their wickedness; nor is it conso∣nant to the life they live, to hold fast an ad∣vantage unjustly gained.</P>
<P>The Negroes who live by plunder, and the slave-trade, steal poor innocent children, in∣vade their neighbours territories, and spill much blood to get these slaves: and can it be possible for an honest man to think that, with a view to self-interest, we may continue slavery to the offspring of these unhappy sufferers, merely because they are the chil∣dren of slaves, and not have a share of this guilt?</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="013782_0336_0F91B402F21D29A0"/>
It is granted by many, that the means used in getting them are unrighteous, and that buying them, when brought here, is wrong; yet as setting them free is attended with some difficulty, they do not comply with it; but seem to be of the opinion, that to give them food and raiment, and keep them servants, without any other wages, is the best way to manage them that they know of: and hoping that their children after them will not be cruel to the Negroes, conclude to leave them as slaves to their children.</P>
<P>While present outward interest is the chief object of our attention, we shall feel many objections in our minds against renouncing our claim to them, as the children of slaves; for being prepossessed with wrong opinions, prevents our seeing things clearly, which, to indifferent persons, are easy to be seen.</P>
<P>Suppose a person seventy years past, in low circumstances, bought a Negroe man and woman, and that the children of such person are now wealthy, and have the children of such slaves. Admit that the first Negroe man and his wife did as much business as their master and mistress, and that the children of the slaves have done some more than their young masters: suppose, on the whole, that the expence of living has been less on the Negroes side, than on the other (all which are no improbable suppositions) it follows, that in equity these Negroes have a right to a part of this increase; that should some diffi∣culties arise on their being set free, there is
<PB N="324" REF="013782_0337_0F91B403ADF76CF0"/>
reason for us patiently to labour through them.</P>
<P>As the conduct of men varies, relating to civil society; so different treatment is justly due to them. Indiscreet men occasion trou∣ble in the world; and it remains to be the care of such, who seek the good of mankind, to admonish as they find occasion.</P>
<P>The slothfulness of some of them, in pro∣viding for themselves and families, it is like∣ly, would require the notice of their neigh∣bours; nor is it unlikely that some would, with justice, be made servants, and others punished for their crimes. Pure justice points out to each individual their due; but to de∣ny a people the privilege of human creatures, on a supposition that, being free, many of them would be troublesome to us, is to mix the condition of good and bad men together, and treat the whole as the worst of them de∣serve.</P>
<P>If we seriously consider, that liberty is the right of innocent men; that the mighty God is a refuge for the oppressed; that in reality we are indebted to them; that they being set free, are still liable to the penalties of our laws, and as likely to have punishment for their crimes as other people: this may an∣swer all our objections. And to retain them in perpetual servitude, without just cause for it, will produce effects, in the event, more grievous than setting them free would do, when a real love to truth and equity was the motive to it.</P>

Our authority over them stands originally in a purchase made from those who, as to the general, obtained theirs by unrighteous∣ness. Whenever we have recourse to such authority, it tends more or less to obstruct the channels, through which the perfect plant in us receives nourishment.</P>
<P>There is a principle, which is pure, placed in the human mind, which in different places and ages hath had different names; it is, however, pure, and proceeds from God.—It is deep, and inward, confined to no forms of religon, nor excluded from any, where the heart stands in perfect sincerity. In whomsoever this takes root, and grows, of what nation soever, they become brethren, in the best sense of the expression. Using ourselves to take ways which appear most ea∣sy to us, when inconsistent with that purity which is without beginning, we thereby set up a government of our own, and deny obe∣dience to him, whose service is true liberty.</P>
<P>He that hath a servant, made so wrongful∣ly, and knows it to be so, when he treats him otherwise than a free man, when he reaps the benefit of his labour, without pay∣ing him such wages as are reasonably due to free men for the like service, cloaths except∣ed; these things, tho' done in calmness, without any shew of disorder, do yet deprave the mind in like manner, and with as great certainty, as prevailing cold congeals water. These steps taken by masters, and their con∣duct striking the minds of their children,
<PB N="326" REF="013782_0339_0F91B4052A688588"/>
whilst young, leave less room for that which is good to work upon them. The customs of their parents, their neighbours, and the people with whom they converse, working upon their minds; and they, from thence, conceiving ideas of things, and modes of conduct, the entrance into their hearts be∣comes, in a great measure, shut up against the gentle movings of uncreated purity.</P>
<P>From one age to another, the gloom grows thicker and darker, till error gets established by general opinion; that whoever attends to perfect goodness, and remains under the melting influence of it, finds a path un∣known to many, and sees the necessity to lean upon the arm of divine strength, and dwell alone, or with a few, in the right commit∣ting their cause to him, who is a refuge for his people, in all their troubles.</P>
<P>Where, through the agreement of a mul∣titude, some channels of justice are stopped, and men may support their characters as just men, by being just to a party, there is great danger of contracting an alliance with that spirit, which stands in opposition to the God of love, and spreads discord, trouble, and vexation among such who give up to the in∣fluence of it.</P>
<P>Negroes are our fellow creatures, and their present condition amongst us requires our serious consideration. We know not the time when those scales, in which mountains are weighed, may turn. The Parent of mankind is gracious: his care is over his
<PB N="327" REF="013782_0340_0F91B40631EDE7F8"/>
smallest creatures; and a multitude of men escape not his notice: And though many of them are trodden down, and despised, yet he remembers them: he seeth their affliction, and looketh upon the spreading increasing exaltation of the oppressor. He turns the channels of power, humbles the most haughty people, and gives deliverance to the oppres∣sed, at such periods as are consistent with his infinite justice and goodness. And wherever gain is preferred to equity, and wrong things publickly encouraged to that degree, that wickedness takes root, and spreads wide a∣mongst the inhabitants of a country, there is real cause for sorrow to all such, whose love to mankind stands on a true principle, and who wisely consider the end and event of things.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MY mind hath often been affected with sor∣row, on account of the prevailing of that spirit, which leads from an humble waiting on the inward teaching of Christ, to pursue ways of living, attended with unnecessary labour, and which draws forth the minds of many peo∣ple
<PB N="329" REF="013782_0342_0F91B40793812618"/>
to seek after outward power, and to strive for riches, which frequently introduce oppression, and bring forth wars and grievous calamities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is with reverence that I acknowledge the mercies of our heavenly Father, who, in infinite love, did visit me in my youth, and wrought a belief in me, that through true obedience a state of inward purity may be known in this life, in which we may love mankind in the same love with which our Redeemer loveth us, and there∣in learn resignation to endure hardships, for the real good of others.</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>While the eye is single, the whole body is full of light,</HI></Q> Mat. vi. 22. <HI>but for want of this, selfish desires, and an imaginary superiori∣ty, darken the mind; hence injustice frequently proceeds; and where this is the case, to con∣vince the judgment, is the most effectual remedy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Where violent measures are pursued in opposing injustice, the passions, and resentments of the in∣jured, frequently operate in the prosecution of their designs; and after conflicts productive of very great calamities, the minds of contending parties often remain as little acquainted with the pure principle of divine love, as they were before; but where people walk in that pure light in which all their <Q>works are wrought in God,</Q></HI> John iii. 21. <HI>and under oppression persevere in the meek spirit, and abide firm in the cause of truth, without actively complying with oppressive demands, through those the Lord hath often manifested his power, in open∣ing the understandings of others, to the promot∣ing righteousness in the earth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS ON PURE WISDOM, AND HUMAN POLICY.</HEAD>
<P>TO have our trust settled in the Lord, and not to seek after, nor desire out∣ward treasures, any further than his holy spirit leads us therein, is a happy state, as saith the prophet, <Q>Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.</Q></P>
<P>Pure wisdom leads people into lowliness of mind, in which they learn resignation to the divine will, and contentment in suffering for his cause, when they cannot keep a clear con∣science without suffering.</P>
<P>In this pure wisdom the mind is attentive to the root, and original spring of motions and desires; and as we know <Q>the Lord to be our refuge,</Q> and find no safety, but in humbly walking before him; we feel an holy engagement, that every desire which leads therefrom may be brought to judgment.</P>
<P>While we proceed in this precious way, and find ardent longings for a full deliverance
<PB N="332" REF="013782_0345_0F91B409AD19D278"/>
from every thing which defiles, all prospects of gain, that are not consistent with the wis∣dom from above, are considered as snares, and an inward concern is felt, that we may live under the cross, and faithfully attend to that holy spirit, which is sufficient to pre∣serve out of them.</P>
<P>When I have considered that saying of Christ, Mat. vi. 19, <Q>Lay not up for your∣selves treasures upon earth,</Q> his omnipo∣tence hath often occurred to my mind.</P>
<P>While we believe that he is every where present with his people, and that perfect goodness, wisdom and power, are united in him, how comfortable is the consideration.</P>
<P>Our wants may be great, but his power is greater. We may be oppressed and despis∣ed, but he is able to turn our patient suffer∣ings into profit to ourselves, and to the ad∣vancement of his work on earth. His people, who feel the power of his cross, to crucify all that is selfish in them, who are engaged in outward concerns, from a con∣vincement that it is their duty, and resign themselves, and their treasures, to him; these feel that it is dangerous to give way to that in us, which craves riches and greatness in this world.</P>
<P>As the heart truly contrite, earnestly de∣sires <Q>to know Christ, and the fellowship of his sufferings,</Q> Phil. iii. 10, so far as the Lord for gracious ends may lead into them; as such feel that it is their interest to put their trust in God, and to seek no gain
<PB N="333" REF="013782_0346_0F91B40A60E923F0"/>
but that which he, by his holy spirit, leads into; so, on the contrary, they who do not reverently wait for this divine teacher, and are not humbly concerned, according to their measure, <Q>to fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ,</Q> Col. i. 24, in patiently suffering for the promoting righte∣ousness in the earth; but have an eye toward the power of men, and the outward advan∣tage of wealth, these are often attentive to those employments which appear profitable, even though the gains arise from such trade and business which proceeds from the work∣ings of that spirit, which is estranged from the self-denying life of an humble contrite christian.</P>
<P>While I write on this subject, I feel my mind tenderly affected toward those honestly disposed people, who have been brought up in employments attended with those diffi∣culties.</P>
<P>To such I may say, in the feeling of our heavenly Father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s love, and number myself with you, O that our eyes may be single to the Lord! may we reverently wait on him for strength, to lay aside all unnecessary ex∣pence of every kind, and learn contentment, in a plain simple life.</P>
<P>May we, in lowliness, submit to the lead∣ings of his spirit, and enter upon any out∣ward employ which he graciously points out to us, and then whatever difficulties arise, in consequence of our faithfulness, I trust they will work for our good.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="013782_0347_0F91B40DC336FB98"/>
Small treasure to a resigned mind is suffi∣cient. How happy is it to be content with a little, to live in humility, and feel that in us, which breathes out this language, Abba! Father.</P>
<P>If that, called the wisdom of this world, had no resemblance of true wisdom, the name of wisdom, I suppose, had not been given to it.</P>
<P>As wasting outward substance, to gratify vain desires, on one hand; so slothfulness and neglect, on the other, do often involve men and their families in trouble, and reduce them to want and distress; to shun both these opposite vices, is good in itself, and hath a resemblance of wisdom; but while people thus provident, have it principally in view to get riches, and power, and the friendship of this world, and do not humbly wait for the spirit of truth to lead them in purity; these, through an anxious care to obtain the end desired, reach forth for gain in worldly wis∣dom, and, in regard to their inward state, fall into divers temptations and snares. And though such may think of applying wealth to good purposes, and to use their power to prevent oppression, yet wealth and power is often applied otherwise; nor can we depart from the leadings of our holy shepherd, with∣out going into confusion.</P>
<P>Great wealth is frequently attended with power, which nothing but divine love can qualify the mind to use rightly; and as to the humility, and uprightness of our chil∣dren
<PB N="335" REF="013782_0348_0F91B40FB7773800"/>
after us, how great is the uncertainty! If, in acquiring wealth, we take hold on the wisdom which is from beneath, and depart from the leadings of truth, and example our children herein, we have great cause to ap∣prehend, that wealth may be a snare to them; and prove an injury to others, over whom their wealth may give them power.</P>
<P>To be redeemed from that wisdom which is from beneath, and walk in the light of the Lord, is a precious situation; thus his people are brought to put their trust in him; and in this humble confidence in his wisdom, good∣ness and power, the righteous find a refuge in adversities, superior to the greatest out∣ward helps, and a comfort more certain than any worldly advantages can afford.</P>

<HEAD>ON LABOUR.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING from my childhood been used to bodily labour for a living, I may express my experience therein.</P>
<P>Right exercise affords an innocent pleasure in the time of it, and prepares us to enjoy the sweetness of rest; but from the extremes each way, arise inconveniences.</P>
<P>Moderate exercise opens the pores, gives the blood a lively circulation, and the better enables us to judge rightly respecting that portion of labour which is the true medium.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="013782_0349_0F91B410F2779228"/>
<Q>The fowls of the air sow not, nor gather into barns, yet our heavenly Father feed∣eth them,</Q> Mat. vi. 26; nor do I believe that infinite goodness and power would have allotted labour to us, had he not seen that la∣bour was proper for us in this life.</P>
<P>The original design, and true medium of labour, is a subject, that, to me, appears worthy of our serious consideration.</P>
<P>Idle men are often a burden to themselves, neglect the duty they owe to their families, and become burdensome to others also.</P>
<P>As outward labour, directed by the wis∣dom from above, tends to our health, and adds to our happiness in this life; so, on the contrary, entering upon it in a selfish spirit, and pursuing it too long, or too hard, hath a contrary effect.</P>
<P>I have observed, that too much labour not only makes the understanding dull, but so intrudes upon the harmony of the body, that after ceasing from our toil, we have another to pass through, before we can be so com∣posed as to enjoy the sweetness of rest.</P>
<P>From too much labour in the heat, fre∣quently proceeds immoderate sweats, which do often, I believe, open the way for disor∣ders, and impair our constitutions.</P>
<P>When we go beyond the true medium, and feel weariness approaching, but think business may suffer if we cease, at such a time spirituous liquors are frequently taken, with a view to support nature under these fatigues.</P>

I have found that too much labour in the summer heats the blood, that taking strong drink to support the body under such labour, increaseth that heat, and though a person may be so far temperate as not to manifest the least disorder, yet the mind, in such a cir∣cumstance, doth not retain that calmness and serenity, which we should endeavour to live in.</P>
<P>Thus toiling in the heat, and drinking strong liquor, makes men more resolute, and less considerate, and tends very much to dis∣qualify from successfully following him who is meek and low of heart.</P>
<P>As laying out business, more than is con∣sistent with pure wisdom, is an evil, so this evil frequently leads into more. Too much business leads to hurry. In the hurry and toil too much strong drink is often used, and hereby many proceed to noise and wanton∣ness, and some, tho' more considerate, do often suffer loss, as to a true composedness of mind.</P>
<P>I feel sincere desires in my heart that no rent, nor interest, might be laid so high as to be a snare to tenants. That no desires of gain may draw any too far in business. That no cares to support customs, which have not their foundation in pure wisdom, may have place in our minds, but that we may build on the sure foundation, and feel our holy shepherd to lead us, who alone is able to pre∣serve us, and bring forth from every thing which defiles.</P>

Having several times, in my travels, had opportunity to observe the labour and man∣ner of life of great numbers of slaves, it ap∣pears to me that the true medium is lament∣ably neglected by many, who assign them their portion of labour.</P>
<P>Without saying much at this time, con∣cerning buying and selling men for term of life, who have as just a right to liberty as we have; nor about the great miseries, and ef∣fusion of blood, consequent to promoting the slave-trade; and to speak as favourably as may be, with regard to continuing those in bondage who are amongst us, we cannot say there is no partiality in it: for whatever ten∣derness may be manifested by individuals in their life time toward them, yet for people to be transmitted from a man to his posterity, in the helpless condition of slaves, appears inconsistent with the nature of the gospel spi∣rit. From such proceedings it often follows, that persons in the decline of life, are de∣prived of monies equitably due to them, and committed to the care, and subjected to the absolute power of young unexperienced men, who know but little about the weakness of old age, nor understand the language of de∣clining life.</P>
<P>Where parents give their estates to their children, and then depend on them for a maintenance, they sometimes meet with great inconveniences; but if the power of posses∣sion, thus obtained, doth often reverse the obligations of gratitude and filial duty, and
<PB N="339" REF="013782_0352_0F91B412B7601DF0"/>
makes manifest, that youth are often igno∣rant of the language of old age, how hard is the case of antient Negroes, who, deprived of the wages equitably due to them, are left to young people, who have been used to look upon them as their inferiors.</P>
<P>For men to behold the fruits of their labour withheld from them, and possessed by others, and in old age find themselves destitute of those comfortable accommodations, and that tender regard which their time of life re∣quires:</P>
<P>When they feel pains, and stiffness in their joints and limbs, weakness of appetite, and that a little labour is wearisome, and still be∣hold themselves in the neglected uncomfort∣able condition of a slave, and oftentimes to a young unsympathising man:</P>
<P>For men to be thus treated from one gene∣ration to another, who, besides their own distresses, think on the slavery entailed on their posterity, and are grieved! what dis∣agreeable thoughts must they have of the professed followers of Jesus! and how must their groans ascend to that almighty being, who "will be a refuge for the oppressed," Psalm ix. 9.</P>

<Q><L><HI>Suffer the little children to come unto me, and so bid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God,</HI></L>
<BIBL>Mark. x. 14.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO encourage children to do things with a view to get praise of men, to me ap∣pears an obstruction to their being inwardly acquainted with the spirit of truth. For it is the work of the Holy Spirit to direct the mind to God, that in all our proceedings we may have a single eye to him. To give alms in secret, to fast in secret, and labour to keep clear of that disposition reproved by our Saviour, <Q>But all their works they do for to be seen of men.</Q> Matt. xxiii. 5.</P>
<P>That divine light which enlightens all men, I believe, does often shine in the minds of children very early, and to humbly wait for wisdom, that our conduct toward them may tend to forward their acquaintance with it, and strengthen them in obedience thereto, appears to me to be a duty on all of us.</P>
<P>By cherishing the spirit of pride, and the love of praise in them, I believe they may sometimes improve faster in learning, than otherwise they would, but to take measures to forward children in learning, which na∣turally tend to divert their minds from true humility, appears to me to favour of the wis∣dom of this world.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="013782_0354_0F91B4141D048720"/>
If tutors are not acquainted with sanctifi∣cation of spirit, nor experienced in an hum∣ble waiting for the leadings of truth, but follow the maxims of the wisdom of this world, such children who are under their tu∣ition, appear to me to be in danger of im∣bibing thoughts, and apprehensions, reverse to that meekness, and lowliness of heart, which is necessary for all the true followers of Christ.</P>
<P>Children at an age fit for schools, are in a time of life which requires the patient atten∣tion of pious people, and if we commit them to the tuition of such, whose minds we be∣lieve are not rightly prepared to <Q>train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</Q> we are in danger of not acting the part of faithful parents toward them; for our heavenly father doth not require us to do evil, that good may come of it; and it is needful that we deeply examine ourselves, lest we get entangled in the wisdom of this world, and, through wrong apprehensions, take such methods in education, as may prove a great injury to the minds of our children.</P>
<P>It is a lovely sight to behold innocent chil∣dren! and when they are sent to such schools where their tender minds are in imminent danger of being led astray by tutors, who do not live a self-denying life, or by the conver∣sation of such children who do not live in innocence, it is a case much to be lamented.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="013782_0355_0F91B4150B39B010"/>
While a pious tutor hath the charge of no more children than he can take due care of, and keeps his authority in the truth, the good spirit in which he leads and governs, works on the minds of such who are not hard∣ened, and his labours not only tend to bring them forward in outward learning, but to open their understandings with respect to the true christian life; but where a person hath charge of too many, and his thoughts and time are so much employed in the out∣ward affairs of his school, that he does not so weightily attend to the spirit and conduct of each individual, as to be enabled to admi∣nister rightly to all in due season; through such omission he not only suffers, as to the state of his own mind, but the minds of the children are in danger of suffering also.</P>
<P>To watch the spirit of children, to nurture them in gospel love, and labour to help them against that which would mar the beauty of their minds, is a debt we owe them; and a faithful performance of our duty, not only tends to their lasting benefit, and our own peace, but also to render their company a∣greeable to us.</P>
<P>Instruction, thus administered, reaches the pure witness in the minds of such chil∣dren who are not hardened, and begets love in them toward those who thus lead them on; but where too great a number are committed to a tutor, and he, through much cumber, omits a careful attention to the minds of chil∣dren,
<PB N="343" REF="013782_0356_0F91B415A5A24ED0"/>
there is danger of disorders gradually increasing amongst them, till the effects there∣of appear in their conduct, too strong to be easily remedied.</P>
<P>A care hath lived on my mind, that more time might be employed by parents at home, and by tutors at school, in weightily attend∣ing to the spirit and inclinations of children, and that we may so lead, instruct, and go∣vern them, in this tender part of life, that nothing may be omitted in our power, to help them on their way to become the chil∣dren of our father, who is in heaven.</P>
<P>Meditating on the situation of schools in our provinces, my mind hath, at times, been affected with sorrow, and under these exer∣cises it hath appeared to me, that if those who have large estates, were faithful stew∣ads, and laid no rent, nor interest, nor other demand, higher than is consistent with uni∣versal love; and those in lower circumstan∣ces would, under a moderate employ, shun unnecessary expence, even to the smallest ar∣ticle; and all unite in humbly seeking to the Lord, he would graciously instruct us, and strengthen us, to relieve the youth from various snares, in which many of them are entangled.</P>

<HEAD>On the RIGHT USE of the LORD's OUTWARD GIFTS.</HEAD>
<P>AS our understandings are opened by the pure light, we experience that, through an inward approaching to God, the mind is strengthened in obedience; and that by gra∣tifying those desires which are not of his be∣getting, those approaches to him are obstruct∣ed, and the deceivable spirit gains strength.</P>
<P>These truths, being as it were engraven upon our hearts, and our everlasting interest in Christ evidently concerned herein, we be∣come fervently engaged, that nothing may be nourished which tends to feed pride or self-love in us. Thus in pure obedience, we are not only instructed in our duty to God, but also in the affairs which necessarily re∣late to this life, and the spirit of truth which guides into all truth, leavens the mind with a pious concern, that <Q>whatsoever we do in word or deed, may be done in his name,</Q> Col. iii. 17.</P>
<P>Hence such buildings, furniture, food, and raiment, as best answer our necessities, and are the least likely to feed that selfish spirit which is our enemy, are the most acceptable to us.</P>
<P>In this state the mind is tender, and in∣wardly watchful, that the love of gain draw us not into any business, which may weaken our love to our heavenly father, or bring un∣necessary trouble to any of his creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="013782_0358_0F91B417EF73A8C8"/>
Thus the way gradually opens to cease from that spirit which craves riches and things fetched far, which so mixeth with the cus∣toms of this world, and so intrudes upon the true harmony of life, that the right me∣dium of labour is very much departed from. And as the minds of people are settled in a steady concern, not to hold nor possess any thing but what may be held consistent with the wisdom from above, they consider what they possess as the gift of God, and are in∣wardly exercised, that in all parts of their conduct they may act agreeable to the nature of the peaceable government of Christ.</P>
<P>A little supports such a life; and in a state truly resigned to the Lord, the eye is single, to see what outward employ he leads into, as a means of our subsistence, and a lively care is maintained to hold to that without launching further.</P>
<P>There is a harmony in the several parts of this divine work in the hearts of people; he who leads them to cease from those gain∣ful employments, carried on in that wisdom which is from beneath, delivers also from the desire after worldly greatness, and reconciles the mind to a life so plain, that a little doth suffice.</P>
<P>Here the real comforts of life are not les∣sened. Moderate exercise, in the way of true wisdom, is pleasant both to mind and body.</P>
<P>Food and raiment sufficient, though in the greatest simplicity, is accepted with content and gratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="013782_0359_0F91B418AC3DA730"/>
The mutual love, subsisting between the faithful followers of Christ, is more pure than that friendship which is not seasoned with humility, how specious soever the appear∣ance.</P>
<P>Where people depart from pure wisdom in one case, it is often an introduction to depart from it in many more; and thus a spirit which seeks for outward greatness, and leads into worldly wisdom to attain it, and support it, gets possession of the mind.</P>
<P>In beholding the customary departure from the true medium of labour, and that unne∣cessary toil which many go through, in sup∣porting outward greatness, and procuring delicacies:</P>
<P>In beholding how the true calmness of life is changed into hurry, and that many, by eagerly pursuing outward treasure, are in great danger of withering as to the inward state of the mind:</P>
<P>In meditating on the works of this spirit, and on the desolations it makes amongst the professors of christianity, I may thankfully acknowledge, that I often feel pure love be∣get longings in my heart, for the exaltation of the peaceable kingdom of Christ, and an engagement to labour according to the gift bestowed on me, for the promoting an hum∣ble, plain, temperate way of living: a life where no unnecessary cares, nor expences, may encumber our minds, nor lessen our a∣bility to do good; where no desires after riches, or greatness, may lead into hard deal∣ing;
<PB N="347" REF="013782_0360_0F91B4195CF1ED68"/>
where no connections with wordly minded men, may abate our love to God, nor weaken a true zeal for righteousness: a life, wherein we may diligently labour for resignedness to do, and suffer, whatever our heavenly father may allot for us, in recon∣ciling the world to himself.</P>
<P>When the prophet Isaiah had uttered his vision, and declared that a time was coming wherein <Q>swords should be beat into plow∣shares, and spears into pruning hooks, and that nation should not lift up sword against nation, nor learn war any more;</Q> he im∣mediately directs the minds of people to the divine teacher, in this remarkable language, <Q>O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord,</Q> Isaiah ii. 5.</P>
<P>To wait for the direction of this light, in all temporal as well as spiritual concerns, ap∣pears necessary; for if in any case we enter lightly into temporal affairs, without feeling this spirit of truth to open our way therein, and through the love of this world proceed on, and seek for gain by that business or traffic, which <Q>is not of the father, but of the world,</Q> 1 John ii. 16, we fail in our testimony to the purity and peace of his go∣vernment; and get into that which is for chastisement.</P>
<P>This matter hath lain heavy on my mind, it being evident, that a life less humble, less simple and plain, than that which Christ leads his sheep into, does necessarily require a support, which pure wisdom does not pro∣vide
<PB N="348" REF="013782_0361_0F91B41A1B5F7240"/>
for; hence there is no probability of our being <Q>a peculiar people, so zealous of good works, as to have no fellowship with works of darkness,</Q> Titus ii. 14. Ephes. v. 11, while we have wants to supply which have their foundation in custom, and do not come within the meaning of those expressions, <Q>your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things,</Q> Matt. vi. 32.</P>
<P>These things which he beholds necessary for his people, he fails not to give them in his own way, and time; but as his ways are above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts, so imaginary wants are different <Q>from these things which he knoweth that we have need of.</Q></P>
<P>As my meditations have been on these things, compassion hath filled my heart to∣ward my fellow creatures, involved in cus∣toms, grown up in <Q>the wisdom of this world, which is foolishness with God,</Q> 1 Cor. iii. 19; and O that the youth may be so thoroughly experienced in an humble walking before the Lord, that they may be his children, and know him to be their re∣fuge, their safe unfailing refuge! through the various dangers attending this uncertain state of being.</P>
<P>If those whose minds are redeemed from the love of wealth, and who are content with a plain, simple way of living, do yet find that to conduct the affairs of a family, without giving countenance to unrighteous proceed∣ing
<PB N="349" REF="013782_0362_0F91B41AE042C618"/>
or having fellowship with works of darkness, the most diligent care is necessary:</P>
<P>If customs, distinguishable from universal righteousness, and opposite to the true self-denying life, are now prevalent, and so mix∣ed with trade, and with almost every em∣ploy, that it is only through humble waiting on the inward guidance of truth, that we may reasonably hope to walk safely, and sup∣port an uniform testimony to the peaceable government of Christ:</P>
<P>If this be the case, how lamentably do they expose themselves to temptations, who give way to the love of riches, conform to expen∣sive living, and reach forth for gain, to sup∣port customs, which our holy shepherd leads not into.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On serving the Lord in our outward employ∣ments.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER the humbling dispensations of the Father of mercies, I have felt an inward labour for the good of my fellow creatures, and a concern that the holy spirit, which alone can restore mankind to a state of true harmony, may with singleness of heart be waited for and followed.</P>
<P>I trust there are many under that visitation, which, if faithfully attended to, will make them quick of understanding in the fear of the Lord, and qualify with firmness to be true patterns of the christian life, who in living and walking may hold forth an invi∣tation to others, to come out of the entangle∣ments of the spirit of this world.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="013782_0366_0F91B41E9BBC9600"/>
And that which I feel first to express is, a care for those who are in circumstances, which appear difficult, with respect to sup∣porting their families in a way answerable to pure wisdom, that they may not be discou∣raged, but remember that in humbly obey∣ing the leading of Christ, he owneth us as his friends, <Q>Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you;</Q> and to be a friend to Christ, is to be united to him, who hath all power in heaven and in earth; and tho' a woman may forget her sucking child, yet will he not forget his faithful ones.</P>
<P>The condition of many who dwell in cities hath often affected me with a brotherly sym∣pathy, attended with a desire that resignati∣on may be laboured for; and where the ho∣ly leader directeth to a country life or some change of employ, he may be faithfully fol∣lowed; for under the refining hand of the Lord I have seen, that the inhabitants of some cities are greatly increased through some branches of business which his holy spirit doth not lead into, and that being entangled in these things, tends to bring a cloud over the minds of people convinced of the lead∣ings of this holy leader, and obstructs the coming of the kingdom of Christ on earth as it is in heaven.</P>
<P>Now if we indulge a desire to imitate our neighbours in those things which harmonise not with the true christian walking, these entanglements may hold fast to us, and some,
<PB N="354" REF="013782_0367_0F91B421AC69B870"/>
who in an awakening time, feel tender scru∣ples, with respect to their manner of life, may look on the example of others more no∣ted in the church, who yet may not be re∣fined from every degree of dross; and by looking on these examples, and desiring to support their families in a way pleasant to the natural mind, there may be danger of the worldly wisdom gaining strength in them, and of their departure from that pure feeling of truth, which if faithfully attended to, would teach contentment in the divine will, even in a very low estate.</P>
<P>One formerly speaking on the profitable∣ness of true humility, faith, "He that troubles not himself with anxious thoughts for more than is necessary, lives little less than the life of angels, whilst by a mind content with little, he imitates their want of nothing." Cave's primitive christianity, page 31.</P>
<P>"It is not enough, says Tertullian, that a christian be chaste and modest, but he must appear to be so: a virtue of which he should have so great a store, that it should flow from his mind upon his habit, and break from the retirements of his conscience, into the super∣ficies of his life." Same book, page 43.</P>
<P>"The garments we wear, says Clemens, ought to be mean and frugal—that is true simplicity of habit, which takes away what is vain and superfluous; that the best and most solid garment, which is the farthest from curiosity." Page 49.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="013782_0368_0F91B422D07BB618"/>
Though the change from day to night, is by a motion so gradual as scarcely to be per∣ceived, yet when night is come we behold it very different from the day; and thus as people become wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight, customs rise up from the spirit of this world, and spread by little and little, till a departure from the simplicity that there is in Christ, becomes as distinguishable as light from darkness, to such who are crucified to the world.</P>
<P>Our holy shepherd, to encourage his flock in firmness and perseverance, reminds them of his love for them, <Q>As the father hath loved me, so have I loved you; continue ye in my love;</Q> and in another place graci∣ously points out the danger of departing there∣from, by going into unsuitable employments; this he represents in the similitude of offence from that useful active member, the hand; and to fix the instruction the deeper, names the right hand, <Q>If thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee</Q>—If thou feelest offence in thy employment, hum∣bly follow him who leads into all truth, and is a strong and faithful friend to those who are resigned to him.</P>
<P>Again, he points out those things which appearing pleasant to the natural mind, are not best for us, in the similitude of offence from the eye, <Q>If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out, and cast it from thee.</Q> To pluck out the eye, or cut off the hand, is at∣tended with sharp pain; and how precious is
<PB N="356" REF="013782_0369_0F91B4231DEDDD80"/>
the instruction which our redeemer thus opens to us, that we may not faint under the most painful trials, but put our trust in him, even in him who sent an angel to feed Elijah in the wilderness; who fed a multitude with a few barley loaves, and is now as attentive to the wants of his people as ever.</P>
<P>The prophet Isaiah, represents the unrigh∣teous doings of the Israelites toward the poor, as the fruits of an effeminate life, <Q>As for my people, children are their oppres∣sors, and women rule over them; what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor, saith the Lord God.</Q> Then he mentions the haugh∣tiness of the daughters of Sion, and enume∣rates many ornaments, as instances of their vanity, to uphold which, the poor were so hardly dealt with, that he sets forth their po∣verty, their leanness and inability to help themselves, in the similitude of a man maim∣ed by violence or "beaten to pieces," and forced to endure the painful operation of having his face gradually worn away in the manner of grinding.</P>
<P>And I may here add, that at times, when I have felt true love open my heart towards my fellow creatures, and been engaged in weighty conversation in the cause of righte∣ousness, the instructions I have received un∣der these exercises, in regard to the true use of the outward gifts of God, have made deep and lasting impressions on my mind.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="013782_0370_0F91B423E7D03AF0"/>
I have here beheld, how the desire to pro∣vide wealth, and to uphold a delicate life hath grievously entangled many, and been like snares to their offspring; and though some have been affected with a sense of their difficulties, and appeared desirous, at times, to be helped out of them; yet for want of abiding under the humbling power of truth, they have continued in these entanglements; for in remaining conformable to this world, and giving way to a delicate life, this ex∣pensive way of living, in parents and in children, hath called for a large supply, and in answering this call "the faces of the poor" have been ground away, and made thin thro' hard dealing.</P>
<P>There is balm, there is a physician! and O what longings do I feel! that we may em∣brace the means appointed for our healing, know that removed which now ministers cause for the cries of many people to ascend to heaven against their oppressors, and that we may see the true harmony restored.</P>
<P>Behold <Q>how good and how pleasant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</Q> The nature of this unity is thus opened by the apostle, <Q>If we walk in the light, as Christ is in the light, we shall have fel∣lowship one with another, and the blood of Christ will cleanse us from all sin.</Q></P>
<P>The land may be polluted with innocent blood, which like the blood of Abel may cry to the Almighty; but those who <Q>walk in the light as Christ is in the light,</Q> they
<PB N="358" REF="013782_0371_0F91B424A48A4368"/>
know the <Q>lamb of God, who taketh away sin.</Q></P>
<P>Walking is a phrase frequently used in scrip∣ture, to represent our journey through life, and appears to comprehend the various affairs and transactions properly relating to our be∣ing in this world.</P>
<P>Christ being the light, dwells always in the light, and if our walking be thus, and in every affair and concern we faithfully follow this divine leader; he preserves from giving just cause for any to quarrel with us; and where this foundation is laid and mutually kept to, by families conversant with each o∣ther, the way is open for these comforts in society, which our heavenly father intends as a part of our happiness in this world; and then we may experience the goodness, and pleasantness of dwelling together in unity; but where ways of living take place, which tend to oppression, and in the pursuit of wealth, people do that to others which they know would not be acceptable to themselves, either in exercising an absolute power over them, or otherwise laying on them unequit∣able burdens; here a fear lest that measure should be meeted to them, which they have measured to others, incites a care to support that by craft and cunning devices which stands not on the firm foundation of righte∣ousness: thus the harmony of society is broken, and from hence commotions and wars do frequently arise in the world.</P>

<Q>Come out of Babylon my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</Q> Rev. xv. 3, 4. This Babel, or Babylon, was built in the spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of self-exaltation: <Q>Let us build us a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven, and let us make us a name.</Q> Gen. xi. 4. In departing from an humble trust in God, and following a selfish spirit, people have intentions to get the upperhand of their fellow creatures, privately meditate on means to obtain their ends, have a language in their hearts which is hard to understand. In Ba∣bel the language is confounded.</P>
<P>This city is represented as a place of busi∣ness and those employed in it, as merchants of the earth: <Q>The merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</Q> Rev. xviii. 3.</P>
<P>And it is remarkable in this call, that the language from the father of mercies is, my people, "Come out of Babylon my people!" Thus his tender mercies are toward us in an imperfect state; and as we faithfully attend to the call, the path of righteousness is more and more opened; cravings, which have not their foundation in pure wisdom, more and more cease; and in an inward purity of heart, we experience a restoration of that which was lost at Babel, represented by the inspired prophet in the <Q>returning of a pure language.</Q> Zeph. iii. 9.</P>
<P>Happy for them who humbly attend to the call, "Come out of Babylon my people."

For though in going forth we may meet with trials, which for a time may be painful, yet as we bow in true humility, and continue in it, an evidence is felt that God only is wise; and that in weaning us from all that is self∣ish, he prepares the way to a quiet habitation where all our desires are bounded by his wis∣dom. And an exercise of spirit attends me, that we who are convinced of the pure lead∣ings of truth, may bow in the deepest reve∣rence, and so watchfully regard this leader, that many who are grievously entangled in a wilderness of vain customs, may look upon us, and be instructed. And O that such who have plenty of this world's goods, may be faithful in that with which they are entrust∣ed! and example others in the true christian walking.</P>
<P>Our blessed Saviour, speaking on worldly greatness, compares himself to one waiting and attending on a company at dinner: <Q>Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am amongst you as he that serveth.</Q> Luke xxii. 27.</P>
<P>Thus in a world greatly disordered, where men aspiring to outward greatness were wont to oppress others to support their designs, he who was of the highest descent, being the Son of God, and greater than any amongst the greatest families of men, by his example and doctrines foreclosed his followers from claiming any shew of outward greatness, from
<PB N="361" REF="013782_0374_0F91B427A9B63130"/>
any supposed superiority in themselves, or derived from their ancestors.</P>
<P>He who was greater than earthly princes, was not only meek and low of heart, but his outward appearance was plain and lowly, and free from every stain of the spirit of this world.</P>
<P>Such was the example of our blessed Re∣deemer, of whom the beloved disciple said, <Q>He that saith he abideth in him, ought also to walk even as he walked.</Q></P>
<P>John Bradford, who suffered martyrdom, under queen Mary, wrote a letter to his friends out of prison, a short time before he was burnt, in which are these expressions; "Consider your dignity as children of God and temples of the Holy Ghost, and mem∣bers of Christ, be ashamed therefore to think, speak, or do any thing unseemly, for God's children and the members of Christ." Fox's Acts and Monuments, page 1177.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the example of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>AS my mind hath been brought into a brotherly feeling with the poor, as to the things of this life, who are under trials in regard to getting a living in a way an∣swerable to the purity of truth; a labour of
<PB N="362" REF="013782_0375_0F91B428648CDF60"/>
heart hath attended me, that their way may not be made difficult through the love of mo∣ney in those who are tried with plentiful estates, but that they with tenderness of heart may sympathize with them.</P>
<P>It was the saying of our blessed Redeemer, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon." There is a deep feeling of the way of purity, a way in which the wisdom of the world hath no part, but is opened by the spirit of truth, and is "called the way of holiness;" a way in which the traveller is employed in watch∣ing unto prayer; and the outward gain we get in this journey is considered as a trust committed to us, by HIM who formed and supports the world; and is the rightful di∣rector of the use and application of the pro∣duct of it.</P>
<P>Now except the mind be preserved chaste, there is no safety for us; but in an estrange∣ment from true resignation, the spirit of the world casts up a way, in which gain is many times principally attended to, and in which there is a selfish application of outward trea∣sures.</P>
<P>How agreeable to the true harmony of so∣ciety, is that exhortation of the apostle? <Q>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.</Q></P>
<P>A person in outward prosperity may have the power of obtaining riches, but the same mind being in him which is in Christ Jesus,
<PB N="363" REF="013782_0376_0F91B42921593B40"/>
he may feel a tenderness of heart towards those of low degree; and instead of setting himself above them, may look upon it as an unmerited favour, that his way through life is more easy than the way of many others; may improve every opportunity of leading forth out of those customs which have en∣tangled the family; employ his time in look∣ing into the wants of the poor members, and hold forth such a perfect example of humili∣ation, that the pure witness may be reached in many minds; and the way opened for a harmonious walking together.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ, in promoting the happiness of others, was not deficient in looking for the helpless, who lay in obscurity, nor did he save any thing to render himself honourable amongst men, which might have been of more use to the weak members in his Father's family; of whose compassion towards us I may now speak a little. He who was per∣fectly happy in himself, moved with infinite love, <Q>took not upon him the nature of an∣gels,</Q> but our imperfect natures, and therein wrestled with the temptations which attend us in this life; and being the Son of HIM who is greater than earthly princes, yet became a companion to poor, sincere heart∣ed men; and though he gave the clearest evidence that divine power attended him, yet the most unfavourable constructions were framed by a self righteous people; those miracles represented as the effect of a diabo∣lical power, and endeavours used to render
<PB N="364" REF="013782_0377_0F91B429E0ED5A10"/>
him hateful, as having his mission from the prince of darkness; nor did their envy cease till they took him like a criminal and brought him to trial. Though some may affect to carry the appearance of being unmoved at the apprehension of distress, our dear Re∣deemer, who was perfectly sincere, having the same human nature which we have, and feeling, a little before he was apprehended, the weight of that work upon him, for which he came into the world, was <Q>sorrowful even unto death;</Q> here the human nature struggled to be excused from a cup so bitter; but his prayers centered in resignation, <Q>Not my will but thine be done.</Q> In this con∣flict, so great was his agony that <Q>sweat like drops of blood fell from him to the ground.</Q></P>
<P>Behold now as foretold by the prophet, he is in a judicial manner <Q>numbered with the transgressors.</Q> Behold him as some poor man of no reputation, standing before the high priest and elders, and before Herod and Pilate, where witnesses appear against him, and he mindful of the most gracious design of his coming, declineth to plead in his own defence, <Q>but as a sheep that is dumb be∣fore his shearer,</Q> so under many accusati∣ons, revilings, and buffetings, remained si∣lent. And tho' he signified to Peter that he had access to power sufficient to overthrow all their outward forces; yet retaining a resig∣nation to suffer for the sins of mankind, he exerted not that power, but permitted them
<PB N="365" REF="013782_0378_0F91B42A9EC47318"/>
to go on in their malicious designs, and pro∣nounce him to be worthy of death, even him who was perfect in goodness; thus <Q>in his humiliation his judgment was taken a∣way, and he, like some vile criminal, led as a lamb to the slaughter.</Q> Under these heavy trials (though poor unstable Pilate was convinced of his innocence, yet) the peo∣ple generally looked upon him as a deceiver, a blasphemer, and the approaching punish∣ment as a just judgment upon him, <Q>They esteemed him smitten of God and afflict∣ed.</Q> So great had been the surprize of his disciples, at his being taken by armed men, that they "forsook him and fled;" thus they hid their faces from him, he was despised, and by their conduct it appeared as though "they esteemed him not."</P>
<P>But contrary to that opinion, of his being smitten of God and afflicted, it was for our sakes that <Q>he was put to grief; he was wounded for our transgressions; he was bruised for our iniquities;</Q> and under the weight of them manifesting the deepest com∣passion for the instruments of his misery, laboured as their advocate, and in the deeps of affliction, with an unconquerable pati∣ence, cried out, <Q>Father forgive them, they know not what they do</Q>!</P>
<P>Now this mind being in us, which was in Christ Jesus, it removes from our hearts the desire of superiority, worldly honour or greatness; a deep attention is felt to the di∣vine counsellor, and an ardent engagement
<PB N="366" REF="013782_0379_0F91B42B76E64E58"/>
to promote, as far as we may be enabled, the happiness of mankind universally; this state, where every motion from a selfish spirit yieldeth to pure love, I may, with gratitude to the father of mercies acknowledge, is oft∣en opened before me as a pearl to dig after; attended with a living concern, that amongst the many nations and families on the earth, those who believe in the Messiah, that <Q>he was manifested to destroy the works of the Devil, and thus to take away the sins of the world, may experience the will of our heavenly Father, may be done on earth as it is in heaven.</Q> Strong are the desires I often feel, that this holy profession may re∣main unpolluted, and the believers in Christ may so abide in the pure inward feeling of his spirit, that the wisdom from above may shine forth in their living, as a light by which others may be instrumentally helped on their way, in the true harmonious walking.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On Merchandizing.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE the treasures of pure love are opened, and we obediently follow him who is the light of life, the mind be∣comes chaste; and a care is felt, that the unction from the holy one may be our leader in every undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="013782_0380_0F91B42DA0A711E0"/>
In being crucified to the world, broken off from that friendship which is enmity with God, and dead to the customs and fashions which have not their foundation in the truth; the way is prepared to lowliness in outward living, and to a disentanglement from those snares which attend the love of money; and where the faithful friends of Christ are so si∣tuated that merchandize appears to be their duty, they feel a restraint from proceeding farther than he owns their proceeding; being convinced that <Q>we are not our own but are bought with a price, that none of us may live to ourselves, but to him who died for us.</Q> 2 Corin. v. 15. Thus they are taught, not only to keep to a moderate advance and uprightness in their dealings; but to consi∣der the tendency of their proceeding; to do nothing which they know would operate a∣gainst the cause of universal righteousness; and to keep continually in view the spreading of the peaceable kingdom of Christ amongst mankind.</P>
<P>The prophet Isaiah spake of the gathered church, in the similitude of a city, where many being employed were all preserved in purity; <Q>They shall call them the holy peo∣ple, the redeemed of the Lord, and thou shalt be called sought out, a city not for∣saken.</Q> lxiii. 10. And the apostle after mentioning the mystery of Christ's sufferings exhorts, <Q>Be ye holy in all manner of con∣versation.</Q> 1 Pet. i. 15. There is a con∣versation necessary in trade; and there is a
<PB N="368" REF="013782_0381_0F91B42E5AAB3D70"/>
conversation so foreign from the nature of Christ's kingdom, that it is represented in the similitude of one man pushing another with a warlike weapon; <Q>There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword.</Q> Prov. xii. 18. Now in all our concerns it is necessary that the leading of the spirit of Christ be humbly waited for and faithfully followed, as the on∣ly means of being preserved chaste as an holy people, who "in all things are circumspect." Exod. xxiii. 13, that nothing we do may carry the appearance of approbation of the works of wickedness, make the unrighteous more at ease in unrighteousness, or occasion the injuries committed against the oppressed to be more lightly looked over.</P>
<P>Where morality is kept to, and supported by the inhabitants of a country, there is a certain reproach attends those individuals a∣mongst them, who manifestly deviate there∣from. Thus, if a person of good report, is charged with stealing goods out of an open shop in the day time, and on a public trial found guilty, and the law in that case put in execution, he therein sustains a loss of repu∣tation; but if he be convicted a second and third time of the like offence, his good name would cease amongst such who knew these things. If his neighbour, reputed an honest man, being charged with buying goods of this thief, at a time when the purchaser knew they were stolen, and on a public trial is found guilty, this purchaser would meet with disesteem, but if he persisted in buying stolen
<PB N="369" REF="013782_0382_0F91B43172DAC898"/>
goods, knowing them to be such, and was publicly convicted thereof a second and third time, he would no longer be considered as an honest man by them who knew these things; nor would it appear of good report to be found in his company, buying his traffick, till some evident tokens of sincere repentance appeared in him. But where iniquity is committed openly, and the authors of it are not brought to justice, nor put to shame, their hands grow strong. Thus the general corruption of the Jews shortly before their state was broke up by the Chaldeans, is de∣scribed by their boldness in impiety; for as their leaders were connected together in wick∣edness, they strengthened one another, and grew confident, <Q>Were they ashamed when they had committed abominations? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.</Q> Jer. vi. 15, on which account the Lord thus expostulates with them, <Q>What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many? and the holy flesh is passed from thee; when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</Q> Jer. xi. 15.</P>
<P>Now the faithful friends of Christ, who hunger and thirst after righteousness, and in∣wardly breath that his kingdom may come on earth as it is in heaven, he teacheth them to be quick of understanding in his fear, and to be very attentive to the means he may ap∣point for promoting pure righteousness in the earth; and as shame is due to those whose
<PB N="370" REF="013782_0383_0F91B43286F985C0"/>
works manifestly operate against the gracious design of his sufferings for us, a care lives on their minds that no wrong customs however supported, may biass their judgments, but that they may humbly abide under the cross and be preserved in a conduct which may not contribute to strengthen the hands of the wicked in their wickedness, or to remove shame from those to whom it is justly due. The coming of that day is precious in which we experience the truth of this expression. "The Lord our righteousness." Jer. xiii. 6, and feel him to be <Q>made unto us wisdom and sanctification.</Q></P>
<P>The example of a righteous man is often looked at with attention. Where righteous men join in business their company gives en∣couragement to others; and as one grain of incense deliberately offered to the prince of this world, renders an offering to God in that state unacceptable; and from those esteemed leaders of the people may be injurious to the weak; it requires deep humility of heart, to follow him faithfully, who alone gives sound wisdom and the spirit of true discerning; and O how necessary it is, to consider the weight of a holy profession!</P>
<P>The conduct of some formerly, gave occa∣sion of complaint against them, <Q>Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick.</Q> Ezek. xxviii. 18, and in several places it is charged against Israel that they had polluted the holy name.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="013782_0384_0F91B432F63A7A10"/>
The prophet Isaiah represents inward sanc∣tification in the similitude of being purged from that which is fuel for fire; and particu∣larly describes the outward fruits, brought forth by those who dwell in this inward ho∣liness, <Q>they walk righteously, and speak uprightly.</Q> By walking he represents the journey through life, as a righteous journey; and "by speaking uprightly," seems to point at that which Moses appears to have had in view, when he thus expressed himself, <Q>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil, nor speak in a case to decline after many to wrest judgment.</Q> Exod. xxiii. 2.</P>
<P>He goes on to shew their firmness in equity; representing them as persons superior to all the arts of getting money, which have not righteousness for their foundation; <Q>They despise the gain of oppressions:</Q> and fur∣ther shews how careful they are that no pro∣spects of gain may induce them to become partial in judgment respecting an injury; <Q>They shake their hands from holding bribes.</Q></P>
<P>Again, where any interest is so connected with shedding blood, that the cry of inno∣cent blood goes also with it; he points out their care to keep innocent blood from crying against them, in the similitude of a man stop∣ping his ears to prevent a sound from enter∣ing his head, <Q>They stop their ears from hearing blood;</Q> and where they know that wickedness is committed, he points out with care, that they do not by an unguarded
<PB N="372" REF="013782_0385_0F91B433A5CF4688"/>
friendship with the authors of it, appear like unconcerned lookers on, but as people so deeply affected with sorrow, that they cannot endure to stand by and behold it; this he re∣presents in the similitude of a man <Q>shutting his eyes from seeing evil.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Who amongst us shall dwell with the de∣vouring fire? Who amongst us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? He that walk∣eth righteously and speaketh uprightly. He that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.</Q> Isaiah xxxiii. 14, 15.</P>
<P>He proceeds in the spirit of prophecy to shew how the faithful being supported under temptations, would be preserved from that defilement that there is in the love of money; that as they who in a reverent waiting on God, feel their strength renewed, are said to "mount upward;" so here their preservation from the snare of unrighteous gain, is repre∣sented in the likeness of a man, borne up above all crafty, artful means of getting the advantage of another, <Q>They shall dwell on high;</Q> and points out the stability and firmness of their condition, <Q>His place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks;</Q> and that under all the outward appearances of loss, in denying himself of gainful profits for righteousness sake, yet through the care of him who provides for the sparrows, he should have a supply answerable to his infi∣nite
<PB N="373" REF="013782_0386_0F91B4346F34EA48"/>
wisdom, <Q>Bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure.</Q> And as our Sa∣viour mentions the sight of God to be attain∣able by "the pure in heart," so here the pro∣phet pointed out, how in true sanctification the understanding is opened, to behold the peaceable harmonious nature of his kingdom, "thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty:" and that looking beyond all the afflictions which attend the righteous, to <Q>a habitati∣on eternal in the heavens,</Q> they with an eye divinely open <Q>shall behold the land that is very far off.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He shall dwell on high, his place of de∣fence shall be the munitions of rocks, bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure. Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off.</Q> Isaiah xxxiii. 16, 17.</P>
<P>I often remember, and to me the subject is awful, that the great Judge of all the earth doeth that which is right, and that he <Q>be∣fore whom the nations are as the drop of a bucket,</Q> is "no respecter of persons." Happy for them, who like the inspired pro∣phet, "in the way of his judgments wait for him." Isaiah xxvi. 8.</P>
<P>When we feel him to sit as a refiner with fire, and know a resignedness wrought in us, to that which he appoints for us, his blessing in a very low estate, is found to be more pre∣cious than much outward treasure in those ways of life where the leadings of his spirit are not followed.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="013782_0387_0F91B43526FB4368"/>
The prophet in a sight of divine work a∣mongst many people, declared in the name of the Lord, <Q>I will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come and see my glory. Isaiah lxvi. 18. And again, from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, my name shall be great amongst the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering.</Q> Malachi i. 11.</P>
<P>Behold here how the prophets had an in∣ward sense of the spreading of the kingdom of Christ; and how he was spoken of as one who should <Q>take the heathen for his inhe∣ritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for his possession. Psal. ii. 8. That he was given for a light to the Gentiles; and for salvation to the ends of the earth.</Q> Isaiah xlix. 6.</P>
<P>When we meditate on this divine work, as a work of ages; a work that the prophets felt long before Christ appeared visibly on earth, and remember the bitter agonies he endured when he "poured out his soul unto death," that the heathen nations, as well as others, might come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved.</P>
<P>When we contemplate on this marvellous work, as that which <Q>the angels desire to look into.</Q> 1 Pet. i. 12. And behold peo∣ple amongst whom this light hath eminently broken forth, and who have received many favours from the bountiful hand of our hea∣venly Father; not only indifferent with re∣spect

to publishing the glad tidings amongst the Gentiles, as yet sitting in darkness and entangled with many superstitions; but a∣spiring after wealth and worldly honours, take hold of means to obtain their ends, tending to stir up wrath and indignation, and to beget an abhorrence in them to the name of christianity. When these things are weightily attended to, how mournful is the subject?</P>
<P>It is worthy of remembrance, that people in different ages, deeply baptised into the na∣ture of that work for which Christ suffered, have joyfully offered up their liberty and lives for the promoting of it in the earth.</P>
<P>Policarp, who was reputed a disciple of St. John, having attained to great age, was at length sentenced to die for his religion, and being brought to the fire, prayed nearly as follows, "Thou God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom I have received the knowledge of thee! O God of the angels and powers, and of every living creature, and of all sorts of just men which live in thy presence. I thank thee! that thou hast gra∣ciously vouchsafed this day and this hour to allot me a portion among the number of martyrs, among the people of Christ, unto the resurrection of everlasting life; among whom I shall be received in thy sight, this day, as a fruitful and acceptable sacrifice, wherefore for all this, I praise thee, I bless thee, I glorify thee through the everlasting high Priest, Jesus Christ, thy well beloved

<P>Bishop Latimer, when sentence of death by fire, was pronounced against him, on ac∣count of his firmness in the cause of religion, he said, "I thank God most heartily! that he hath prolonged my life to this end; that I may, in this case glorify him by this kind of death." Fox's Acts and Mon. 936.</P>
<P>William Dewsbery, who had suffered much for his religion, in his last sickness, encou∣raging his friends to faithfulness, made men∣tion, like good old Jacob, of the loving kind∣ness of God to him in the course of his life, and that through the power of divine love, he for Christ's sake had joyfully entered pri∣sons. See introduction to his works.</P>
<P>I mention these, as a few examples, out of many, of the powerful operation of the spirit of Christ, where people are fully devoted to it, and of the ardent longings in their minds for the spreading of his kingdom amongst mankind. Now to those, in the present age, who truly know Christ, and feel the nature of his peaceable government opened in their understandings, how loud is that call where∣with we are called to faithfulness; that in following this pure light of life, <Q>we as workers together with him,</Q> may labour in that great work for which he was offered as a sacrifice on the cross; and that his peace∣able doctrines may shine through us in their real harmony, at a time when the name of

<P>SUCH are the perfections of our heaven∣ly Father, that in all the dispensations of his providence, it is our duty, <Q>in every thing, to give thanks.</Q> Though from the first settlement of this part of America, he hath not extended his judgments to the degree of famine, yet worms at times have come forth beyond numbering, and laid waste fields of grain and grass, where they have appeared: another kind, in great multitudes,
<PB N="378" REF="013782_0391_0F91B43A7A5067E0"/>
working out of sight, in grass ground, have so eat the roots that the surface, being loos∣ened from the soil beneath, might be taken off in great sheets.</P>
<P>These kind of devouring creatures appear∣ing seldom, and coming in such multitudes, their generation appears different from most other reptiles, and by the prophet were call∣ed "God's army sent amongst the people." Joel ii. 25.</P>
<P>There have been tempests of hail, which have very much destroyed the grain where they extended. Through long drought in summer, grain in some places hath been less than half the usual quantity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When crops sail, I often feel a tender care that the case <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE>; and in the continuance thereof, I have beheld with at∣tention, from week to week, how dryness from the top of the earth, hath extended deeper and deeper, while the corn and plants have languished; and with reverence my mind hath been turned toward HIM, who being perfect in goodness, in wisdom and power, doeth all things right. And after long drought, when the sky hath grown dark with a collection of matter, and clouds like lakes of water hung over our heads, from whence the thirsty land hath been soaked; I have at times, with awfulness, beheld the ve∣hement operation of lightning, made some∣times to accompany these blessings, as a mes∣senger
<PB N="379" REF="013782_0392_0F91B43B213C4530"/>
from HIM who created all things, to remind us of our duty in a right use of those benefits, and give striking admonitions, that we do not misapply those gifts, in which an Almighty power is exerted, in bestowing them upon us.</P>
<P>When I have considered that many of our fellow creatures suffer much in some places, for want of the necessaries of life, whilst those who rule over them are too much given to luxury, and divers vanities; and behold the apparent deviation from pure wisdom amongst us, in the use of the outward gifts of God; those marks of famine have appeared like humbling admonitions from him, that we might be instructed by gentle chastisements, and might seriously consider our ways; re∣membring that the outward supply of life is a gift from our heavenly Father, and that we should no more venture to use, or apply his gifts, in a way contrary to pure wisdom.</P>
<P>Should we continue to reject those merci∣ful admonitions, and use his gifts at home, contrary to the gracious design of the giver, or send them abroad in a way of trade, which the spirit of truth doth not lead into; and should he whose eyes are upon all our ways, extend his chastisements so far as to reduce us to much greater distress than hath yet been felt by these provinces; with what sorrow of heart might we meditate on that subject, <Q>Hast thou not procured this unto thy self, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by thee way?
<PB N="380" REF="013782_0393_0F91B43BEA68C020"/>
Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts.</Q> Jer. ii. 17, 19.</P>
<P>My mind hath often been affected with sorrow, in beholding a wrong application of the gifts of our heavenly Father; and those expressions concerning the defilement of the earth have been opened to my understanding, <Q>The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</Q> Gen. vi. 11. Again, Isaiah xxiv. 5. <Q>The earth also, is defiled under the inhabitants there∣of, because they have—broken the ever∣lasting covenant.</Q></P>
<P>The earth being the work of a divine pow∣er, may not as such be accounted unclean; but when violence is committed thereon, and the channel of righteousness so obstructed, that <Q>in our skirts are found the blood of the souls of poor innocents; not by a se∣cret search, but upon all these.</Q> Jerem. ii. 34.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a caution and warning to Great-Britain and her co-</NOTE></P>

<P>Moreover, when the earth is planted and tilled, and the fruits brought forth are appli∣ed to support unrighteous purposes; here the gracious design of infinite goodness, in these his gifts being perverted, the earth is defiled; and the complaint formerly uttered becomes applicable; <Q>Thou hast made me to serve with thy sins; thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</Q> Isaiah xliii. 24.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On loving our Neighbours as ourselves.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we love the Lord with all our hearts, and his creatures in his love, we are then preserved in ten∣derness both toward mankind and the animal creation; but if another spirit gets room in our minds, and we follow it in our proceed∣ings, we are then in the way of disordering the affairs of society.</P>
<P>If a man successful in business expends part of his income in things of no real use, while the poor employed by him pass through great difficulties in getting the necessaries of life, this requires his serious attention.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="013782_0396_0F91B43E1BE718D0"/>
If several principal men in business unite in setting the wages of those who work for hire, and therein have regard to a profit to themselves answerable to unnecessary expence in their families, while the wages of the others on a moderate industry will not afford a com∣fortable living for their families, and a pro∣per education for their children; this is like laying a temptation in the way of some to strive for a place higher than they are in, when they have not stock sufficient for it.</P>
<P>Now I feel a concern in the spring of pure love, that all who have plenty of outward substance, may example others in the right use of things; may carefully look into the condition of poor people, and beware of ex∣acting on them with regard to their wages.</P>
<P>While hired labourers, by moderate in∣dustry, through the divine blessing, may live comfortably, raise up families, and give them suitable education, it appears reasonable for them to be content with their wages.</P>
<P>If they who have plenty, love their fellow creatures in that love which is divine, and in all their proceedings have an equal regard to the good of mankind universally, their place in society is a place of care, an office requir∣ing attention, and the more we possess, the greater is our trust, and with an increase of treasure, an increase of care becomes neces∣sary.</P>
<P>When our will is subject to the will of God, and in relation to the things of this world, we have nothing in view, but a comfortable
<PB N="384" REF="013782_0397_0F91B2ED64B14B98"/>
living equally with the rest of our fellow creatures, then outward treasures are no far∣ther desirable than as we feel a gift in our minds equal to the trust, and strength to act as dutiful children in his service, who hath formed all mankind, and appointed a sub∣sistence for us in this world.</P>
<P>A desire for treasures on any other motive, appears to be against that command of our blessed Saviour, <Q>Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, Mat. vi. 19.</Q></P>
<P>He forbids not laying up in the summer against the wants of winter; nor doth he teach us to be slothful in that which properly relates to our being in this world; but in this prohibition he puts in <HI>yourselves</HI> <Q>Lay not up for <HI>yourselves</HI> treasures here on earth.</Q></P>
<P>Now in the pure light, this language is understood, for in the love of Christ there is no respect of persons; and while we abide in his love, we live not to ourselves, but to him who died for us. And as we are thus united in spirit to Christ, we are engaged to labour in promoting that work in the earth for which he suffered.</P>
<P>In this state of mind our desires are, that every honest member in society may have a portion of treasure, and share of trust, an∣swerable to that gift, with which our hea∣venly Father hath gifted us.</P>
<LG>
<L>In great treasure, there is a great trust.</L>
<L>A great trust requireth great care.</L>
<L>But the laborious mind wants rest.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="385" REF="013782_0398_0F91B2EE38DA88F0"/>
A pious man is content to do a share of business in society, answerable to the gif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with which he is endowed, while the chan∣nels of business are free from unrighteous∣ness, but is careful lest at any time his heart be overcharged.</P>
<P>In the harmonious spirit of society <Q>Christ is all in all,</Q> Col. iii. 11.</P>
<P>Here it is that <Q>old things are past away, all things are new, all things are of God,</Q> 2 Cor. v. 17, 18. and the desire for outward riches is at an end.</P>
<P>They of low degree who have small gifts, enjoy their help who have large gifts; those with their small gifts, have a small degree of care, while these with their large gifts, have a large degree of care: and thus to abide in the love of Christ, and enjoy a comfortable living in this world is all that is aimed at by those members in society, to whom Christ is made wisdom and righteousness.</P>
<P>But when they who have much treasure, are not faithful stewards of the gifts of God, great difficulties attend it.</P>
<P>Now this matter hath deeply affected my mind. The Lord, through merciful chastise∣ments, hath given me a feeling of that love, in which the harmony of society standeth, and a sight of the growth of that seed which bringeth forth wars and great calamities in the world, and a labour attends me to open it to others.</P>
<P>Now to act with integrity, according to that strength of mind and body with which
<PB N="386" REF="013782_0399_0F91B2EF23CA5698"/>
our creator hath endowed each of us, appears necessary for all, and he who thus stands in the lowest station, appears to be entitled to as comfortable and convenient a living, as he whose gifts of mind are greater, and whose cares are more extensive.</P>
<P>If some endowed with strong understand∣ings as men, abide not in the harmonious state, in which we <Q>love our neighbours as ourselves,</Q> but walk in that spirit in which the children of this world are wise in their generation; these by the strength of contri∣vance may sometimes gather great treasure, but the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; and if we gather treasures in worldly wisdom, we lay up <Q>treasures for ourselves;</Q> and great treasures managed in any other spirit, than the spirit of truth, disordereth the affairs of society, for hereby the good gifts of God in this outward crea∣tion are turned into the channels of worldly honour, and frequently applied to support luxury, while the wages of poor labourers are such, that with moderate industry and frugality they may not live comfortably, raise up families, and give them suitable educati∣on, but through the streightness of their con∣dition, are often drawn on to labour under weariness, to toil through hardships them∣selves, and frequently to oppress those useful animals with which we are entrusted.</P>
<P>From age to age, throughout all ages, di∣vine love is that alone, in which dominion has been, is, and will be rightly conducted.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="013782_0400_0F91B2EFAD056018"/>
In this the endowments of men are so em∣ployed, that the friend and the governor are united in one, and oppressive customs come to an end.</P>
<P>Riches in the hands of individuals in so∣ciety, is attended with some degree of power; and so far as power is put forth separate from pure love, so far the government of the Prince of Peace is interrupted; and as we know not that our children after us will dwell in that state in which power is rightly applied, to lay up riches for them appears to be against the nature of his government.</P>
<P>The earth, through the labour of men un∣der the blessing of him who formed it, yield∣eth a supply for the inhabitants from gene∣ration to generation, and they who walk in the pure light, their minds are prepared to taste and relish not only those blessings which are spiritual, but also feel a sweetness and sa∣tisfaction in a right use of the good gifts of God in the visible creation.</P>
<P>Here we see that man's happiness stands not in great possessions, but in a heart de∣voted to follow Christ; in that use of things, where customs contrary to universal love have no power over us.</P>
<P>In this state our hearts are prepared to trust in God, and our desires for our children and posterity are, that they, with the rest of man∣kind, in ages to come, may be of that num∣ber, of whom he hath said, <Q>I will be a father to them, and they shall be my sons and daughter,</Q> 2 Cor. vi. 18.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="013782_0401_0F91B2F06151B190"/>
When wages in a fruitful land bear so small a proportion to the necessaries of life, that poor honest people who have families cannot by a moderate industry attain to a comfort∣able living, and give their children sufficient learning, but must either labour to a degree of oppression, or else omit that which appears to be a duty.</P>
<P>While this is the case with the poor, there is an inclination in the minds of most people, to prepare at least so much treasure for their children, that they with care and moderate industry may live free from these hardships which the poor pass through.</P>
<P>Now this subject requireth our serious con∣sideration: to labour that our children may be put in a way to live comfortably, appears in itself to be a duty, so long as these our labours are consistent with universal righte∣ousness; but if in striving to shun poverty, we do not walk in that state where <Q>Christ is our life, then we wander; He that hath the Son, hath life, 1 John v. 12. This life is the light of men,</Q> John i. 4. If we walk not in this light, we walk in darkness, and <Q>he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth,</Q> John xii. 35.</P>
<P>To keep to right means in labouring to attain a right end is necessary: if in striving to shun poverty, we strive only in that state, where Christ is the light of our life, our la∣bours will stand in the true harmony of so∣ciety; but if people are confident that the
<PB N="389" REF="013782_0402_0F91B2F1267C10E8"/>
end aimed at is good, and in this confidence pursue it so eagerly, as not to wait for the spirit of truth to lead them, then they come to loss. <Q>Christ is given to be a leader and commander of the people,</Q> Isaiah lv. 4. Again; <Q>The Lord shall guide thee conti∣nually, Isaiah lviii. 12. Again; Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us, for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.</Q> Isaiah xxvi. 12.</P>
<P><Q>In the Lord have we righteousness and strength,</Q> Isaiah xlv. 24.</P>
<P>In this state our minds are preserved watch∣ful in following the leadings of his spirit in all our proceedings in this world, and a care is felt for a reformation in general; that our own posterity, with the rest of mankind in succeeding ages, may not be entangled by oppressive customs, transmitted to them through our hands: but if people in the narrowness of natural love, are afraid that their children will be oppressed by the rich, and through an eager desire to get treasures, depart from the pure leadings of truth in one case, though it may seem to be a small mat∣ter, yet the mind even in that small matter may be emboldened to continue in a way of proceeding, without waiting for the divine Leader.</P>
<P>Thus people may grow expert in business, wise in the wisdom of this world, retain a fair reputation amongst men, and yet being strangers to the voice of Christ, the safe lead∣er of his flock, the treasures thus gotten,
<PB N="390" REF="013782_0403_0F91B2F1F0B55C40"/>
may be like snares to the feet of their poste∣rity.</P>
<P>Now to keep faithful to the pure counsel∣lor, and under trying circumstances suffer adversity for righteousness sake, in this there is a reward.</P>
<P>If we, being poor, are hardly dealt with by those who are rich, and under this diffi∣culty are frugal and industrious, and in true humility open our case to them who oppress us, this may reach the pure witness in their minds; and though we should remain under difficulties as to the outward, yet if we abide in the love of Christ, all will work for our good.</P>
<P>When we feel what it is to suffer in the true suffering state, then we experience the truth of those expressions, that, <Q>as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation aboundeth by Christ,</Q> 2 Cor. i. 5.</P>
<P>But if poor people who are hardly dealt with, do not attain to the true suffering state, do not labour in true love with those who deal hardly with them, but envy their out∣ward greatness, murmur in their hearts be∣cause of their own poverty, and strive in the wisdom of this world to get riches for them∣selves and their children; this is like wan∣dering in the dark.</P>
<P>If we who are of a middle station between riches and poverty, are affected at times with the oppressions of the poor, and feel a tender regard for our posterity after us; O how ne∣cessary
<PB N="391" REF="013782_0404_0F91B2F29FF76920"/>
is it that we wait for the pure counsel of truth!</P>
<P>Many have seen the hardships of the poor, felt an eager desire that their children may be put in a way to escape these hardships; but how few have continued in that pure love which openeth our understandings to proceed rightly under these difficulties!</P>
<P>How few have faithfully followed that ho∣ly Leader who prepares his people to labour for the restoration of true harmony amongst our fellow-creatures!</P>
<P><Q>In the pure gospel spirit we walk by faith and not by sight,</Q> 2 Cor. v. 7.</P>
<P>In the obedience of faith we die to the nar∣rowness of self-love, and our life being hid with Christ in God, our hearts are enlarged toward mankind universally; but in depart∣ing from the true light of life, many in striving to get treasures have stumbled upon the dark mountains.</P>
<P>Now that purity of life which proceeds from faithfulness in following the spirit of truth, that state where our minds are devot∣ed to serve God, and all our wants are bound∣ed by his wisdom, this habitation has often been opened before me as a place of retire∣ment for the children of the light, where we may stand separated from that which dis∣ordereth and confuseth the affairs of society, and where we may have a testimony of our innocence in the hearts of those who behold us.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="013782_0405_0F91B2F617861C28"/>
Through departing from the truth as it is in Jesus, through introducing ways of life attended with unnecessary expences, many wants have arisen, the minds of people have been employed in studying to get wealth, and in this pursuit some departing from equity, have retained a profession of religion; others have looked at their example, and thereby been strengthened to proceed further in the same way: thus many have encouraged the trade of taking men from Africa, and selling them as slaves.</P>
<P>It hath been computed that near one hun∣dred thousand Negroes have of late years been taken annually from that coast, by ships employed in the English trade.</P>
<P>As I have travelled on religious visits in some parts of America, I have seen many of these people under the command of overseers, in a painful servitude.</P>
<P>I have beheld them as Gentiles under peo∣ple professing christianity, not only kept ig∣norant of the holy scriptures, but under great provocations to wrath; of whom it may truly be said, <Q>They that rule over them make them to howl, and the holy Name is abundantly blasphemed,</Q> Isaiah lii. 5. Where children are taught to read the sacred writings, while young, and exampled in meekness and humility, it is often helpful to them; nor is this any more than a debt due from us to a succeeding age.</P>
<P>But where youth are pinched for want of the necessaries of life, forced to labour hard
<PB N="393" REF="013782_0406_0F91B2F8106FFA30"/>
under the harsh rebukes of rigorous over∣seers, and many times endur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unmerciful whippings: in such an education, how great are the disadvantages they lie under! And how forcibly do these things work against the increase of the government of the Prince of Peace!</P>
<P>Humphrey Smith, in his works, p. 125, speaking of the tender feelings of the love of God in his heart when he was a child, said, "By the violent wrathful nature that ruled in others, was my quietness disturbed, and anger begotten in me toward them, yet that of God in me was not wholly overcome, but his love was felt in my heart, and great was my grief when the earthly-mindedness and wrathful nature so provoked me, that I was estranged from it."</P>
<P>"And this I write as a warning to pa∣rents and others, that in the fear of the liv∣ing God, you may train up the youth, and may not be a means of bringing them into such alienation."</P>
<P>Many are the vanities and luxuries of the present age, and in labouring to support a way of living conformable to the present world, the departure from that wisdom that is pure and peaceable, hath been great.</P>
<P>Under the sense of a deep revolt, and an overflowing stream of unrighteousness, my life has been often a life of mourning, and tender desires are raised in me, that the na∣ture of this practice may be laid to heart.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="013782_0407_0F91B2F99B4A05E0"/>
I have read some books wrote by people who were acquainted with the manner of getting slaves in Africa.</P>
<P>I have had verbal relations of this nature from several Negroes brought from Africa, who have learned to talk English.</P>
<P>I have sundry times heard Englishmen speak on this subject, who have been in A∣frica on this business; and from all these ac∣counts it appears evident that great violence is committed, and much blood shed in A∣frica in getting slaves.</P>
<P>When three or four hundred slaves are put in the hold of a vessel in a hot climate, their breathing soon affects the air. Were that number of free people to go passengers with all things proper for their voyage, there would inconvenience arise from their num∣ber; but slaves are taken by violence, and frequently endeavour to kill the white peo∣ple, that they may return to their native land. Hence they are frequenty kept under such a sort of confinement, by means of which a scent ariseth in the hold of a ship, and dis∣tempers often break out amongst them, of which many die. Of this tainted air in the hold of ships freighted with slaves, I have had several accounts, some in print, and some verbal, and all agree that the scent is griev∣ous. When these people are sold in America, and in the islands, they are made to labour in a manner more servile and constant, than that which they were used to at home, that
<PB N="395" REF="013782_0408_0F91B2FA2ED43478"/>
with grief, with different diet from what has been common with them, and with hard la∣bour, some thousands are computed to die every year, in what is called the seasoning.</P>
<P>Thus it appears evident, that great num∣bers of these people are brought every year to an untimely end; many of them being such who never injured us.</P>
<P>Where the innocent suffer under hard-hearted men, even unto death, and the chan∣nels of equity are so obstructed, that the cause of the sufferers is not judged in righte∣ousness, "the land is polluted with blood," Numb. xxxv. 33.</P>
<P>Where blood hath been shed unrighteously, and remains unattoned for, the cry thereof is very piercing.</P>
<P>Under the humbling dispensations of divine Providence, this cry hath deeply affected my heart, and I feel a concern to open, as I may be enabled, that which lieth heavy on my mind.</P>
<P>When <Q>the iniquity of the house of Israel and of Judah was exceeding great, when the land was defiled with blood, and the city full of perversness, Ezek. ix. 9. Some were found sighing and crying for the abominations of the times,</Q> Ezek. ix. 4. and such who live under a right feeling of our condition as a nation, these I trust will be sensible that the Lord at this day doth call to mourning, though many are ignorant of it. So powerful are bad customs when they become general, that people growing bold
<PB N="396" REF="013782_0409_0F91B2FAF13DF8E8"/>
thro' the examples one of another, have often been unmoved at the most serious warnings.</P>
<P>Our blessed Saviour speaking of the people of the old world, said, <Q>They eat, they drank, they married, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noah went into the ark, and the flood came and de∣stroyed them all,</Q> Luke xvii. 27.</P>
<P>The like he spake concerning the people of Sodom, who are also represented by the pro∣phet as haughty, luxurious, and oppressive; <Q>This was the sin of Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was found in her, and in her daughters; nei∣ther did she strengthen the hands of the poor and needy,</Q> Ezek. xvi. 49.</P>
<P>Now in a revolt so deep as this, when much blood has been shed unrighteously, in carrying on the slave-trade, and in support∣ing the practice of keeping slaves, which at this day is unattoned for, and crieth from the earth, and from the seas against the op∣pressor!</P>
<P>While this practice is continued, and un∣der a great load of guilt there is more un∣righteousness committed, the state of things is very moving!</P>
<P>There is a love which stands in nature, and a parent beholding his child in misery hath a feeling of the affliction; but in divine love the heart is enlarged towards mankind universally, and prepared to sympathise with strangers, though in the lowest stations in life.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="013782_0410_0F91B2FB9F37E5C8"/>
Of this the prophet appears to have had a feeling, when he said, <Q>Have we not all one Father? Hath not one God created us? Why then do we deal treacherously every man with his brother, in prophaning the covenant of our fathers?</Q> Mal. ii. 10.</P>
<P>He who of old heard the groans of the children of Israel under the hard task-masters in Egypt, I trust hath looked down from his holy habitation on the miseries of these deep∣ly oppressed people. Many lives have been shortned through extreme oppression, while they laboured to support luxury and worldly greatness; and tho' many people in outward prosperity may think little of those things, yet the gracious Creator hath regard to the cries of the innocent, however unnoticed by men.</P>
<P>The Lord in the riches of his goodness is leading some into the feeling of the condition of this people, who cannot rest without la∣bouring as their advocates; of which in some measure I have had experience, for, in the movings of his love in my heart, these poor sufferers have been brought near to me.</P>
<P>The unoffending aged and infirm made to labour too hard, kept on a diet less com∣fortable than their weak state required, and exposed to great difficulties under hard-heart∣ed men, to whose sufferings I have often been a witness, and under the heart-melting power of divine love, their misery hath felt to me like the misery of my parents.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="013782_0411_0F91B2FC691E4A78"/>
Innocent youth taken by violence from their native land, from their friends and ac∣quaintance; put on board ships with hearts laden with sorrow; exposed to great hard∣ships at sea; placed under people, where their lives have been attended with great provoca∣tion to anger and revenge.</P>
<P>With the condition of these youth, my mind hath often been affected, as with the afflictions of my children, and in a feeling of the misery of these people, and of that great offence which is ministered to them, my tears have been often poured out before the Lord.</P>
<P>That holy Spirit which affected my heart when I was a youth, I trust is often felt by the Negroes in their native land, inclining their minds to that which is righteous, and had the professed followers of Christ in all their conduct toward them, manifested a dis∣position answerable to the pure principle in their hearts, how might the holy Name have been honoured amongst the Gentiles, and how might we have rejoiced in the fulfilling of that prophecy, <Q>I the Lord love judg∣ment, I hate robbery for burnt-offerings, and I will direct their work in truth, and make an everlasting covenant with them. Their seed shall be known amongst the Gentiles, and their offspring amongst the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed,</Q> Isaiah lxi. 8, 9.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="013782_0412_0F91B2FD28AC5E68"/>
But in the present state of things, how contrary is this practice to that meek spirit, in which our Saviour laid down his life for us, that all the ends of the earth might know salvation in his name!</P>
<P>How are the sufferings of our blessed Re∣deemer set at nought, and his name blas∣phemed amongst the Gentiles, through the unrighteous proceedings of his professed fol∣lowers!</P>
<P>My mind hath often been affected, even from the days of my youth, under a sense of that marvellous work, for which God, in in∣finite goodness, sent his Son into the world.</P>
<P>The opening of that spring of living wa∣ters, which the true believers in Christ ex∣perience, by which they are redeemed from pride and covetousness, and brought into a state of meekness, where their hearts are en∣larged in true love toward their fellow crea∣tures universally; this work to me has been precious, and the spreading the knowledge of the truth amongst the Gentiles been very de∣sirable. And the professed followers of Christ joining in customs evidently unrighteous, which manifestly tend to stir up wrath, and increase wars and desolations, hath often co∣vered my mind with sorrow.</P>
<P>If we bring this matter home, and as Job proposed to his friends, <Q>Put our soul in their soul's stead,</Q> Job xvi. 4.</P>
<P>If we consider ourselves and our children as exposed to the hardships which these peo∣ple
<PB N="400" REF="013782_0413_0F91B2FF1D11FC70"/>
lie under in supporting an imaginary greatness.</P>
<P>Did we in such case behold an increase of luxury and superfluity amongst our oppres∣sors, and therewith felt an increase of the weight of our burdens, and expected our po∣sterity to groan under oppression after us.</P>
<P>Under all this misery, had we none to plead our cause, nor any hope of relief from man, how would our cries ascend to the God of the spirits of all flesh, who judgeth the world in righteousness, and in his own time is a refuge for the oppressed!</P>
<P>If they who thus afflicted us, continued to lay claim to religion, and were assisted in their business by others, esteemed pious peo∣ple, who through a friendship with them strengthened their hands in tyranny.</P>
<P>In such a state, when we were hunger-bit∣ten, and could not have sufficient nourish∣ment, but saw them in fulness pleasing their taste with things fetched from far:</P>
<P>When we were wearied with labour, deni∣ed the liberty to rest, and saw them spending their time at case: when garments answer∣able to our necessities were denied us, while we saw them cloathed in that which was costly and delicate:</P>
<P>Under such affliction, how would these painful feelings rise up as witnesses against their pretended devotion! And if the name of their religion was mentioned in our hear∣ing, how would it sound in our ears like a
<PB N="401" REF="013782_0414_0F91B2FF9B8712C8"/>
word which signified self-exaltation, and hardness of heart!</P>
<P>When a trade is carried on, productive of much misery, and they who suffer by it are some thousand miles off, the danger is the greater, of not laying their sufferings to heart.</P>
<P>In procuring slaves on the coast of Africa, many children are stolen privately; wars also are encouraged amongst the Negroes, but all is at a great distance.</P>
<P>Many groans arise from dying men, which we hear not.</P>
<P>Many cries are uttered by widows and fa∣therless children, which reach not our ears.</P>
<P>Many cheeks are wet with tears, and faces sad with unutterable grief, which we see not.</P>
<P>Cruel tyranny is encouraged. The hands of robbers are strengthened, and thousands reduced to the most abject slavery, who ne∣ver injured us.</P>
<P>Were we for the term of one year only to be eye-witnesses to what passeth in getting these slaves:</P>
<P>Was the blood which is there shed to be sprinkled on our garments:</P>
<P>Were the poor captives bound with thongs, heavy laden with elephants teeth, to pass be∣fore our eyes on their way to the sea:</P>
<P>Were their bitter lamentations day after day to ring in our ears, and their mournful cries in the night to hinder us from sleep∣ing:</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="013782_0415_0F91B30028380158"/>
Were we to hear the sound of the tumult when the slaves on board the ships attempt to kill the English, and behold the issue of those bloody conflicts:</P>
<P>What pious man could be a witness to these things, and see a trade carried on in this manner, without being deeply affected with sorrow?</P>
<P>Through abiding in the love of Christ we feel a tenderness in our hearts toward our fellow-creatures, entangled in oppressive cus∣toms; and a concern so to walk, that our conduct may not be a means of strengthening them in error.</P>
<P>It was the command of the Lord through Moses, <Q>Thou shalt not suffer sin upon thy brother: thou shalt in anywise rebuke thy brother, and shalt not suffer sin upon him.</Q> Lev. xix. 17.</P>
<P>Again; <Q>Keep far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not.</Q> Exod. xxiii. 7.</P>
<P>The prophet Isaiah mentions oppression as that which the true church in time of out∣ward quiet should not only be clear of, but should be <HI>far from it;</HI> <Q>Thou shalt be far from oppression.</Q> Isaiah liv. 14. Now these words, <HI>far from,</HI> appear to have an ex∣tensive meaning, and to convey instruction in regard to that of which Solomon speaks, <Q>Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not go unpunished.</Q> Prov. xvi. 5.</P>
<P>It was a complaint against one of old, <Q>When thou sawest a thief, thou consent∣edst with him.</Q> Psal. l, 18.</P>

The prophet Jeremiah represents the de∣grees of preparation toward idolatrous sacri∣fice, in the similitude of a work carried on by children, men, and women. <Q>The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough to bake cakes for the queen of heaven.</Q> Jer. vii. 18.</P>
<P>It was a complaint of the Lord against Is∣rael, through his prophet Ezekiel, that <Q>they strengthened the hands of the wicked, and made the hearts of the righteous sad.</Q> Ezek. xiii. 12.</P>
<P>Some works of iniquity carried on by the people were represented by the prophet Hosea, in the similitude of ploughing, reaping, and eating the fruit; <Q>You have ploughed wick∣edness, reaped iniquity, eaten the fruit of lying, because thou didst trust in thy own way, to the multitude of thy mighty men.</Q> Hosea x. 13.</P>
<P>I have felt great distress of mind since I came on this island, on account of the mem∣bers of our society being mixed with the world in various sorts of business and traffic, carried on in impure channels. Great is the trade to Africa for slaves; and in loading these ships abundance of people are employed in the manufactories.</P>
<P>Friends in early time refused, on a religi∣ous principle, to make or trade in superflui∣ties, of which we have many large testimo∣nies on record, but for want of faithfulness some gave way, even some whose examples
<PB N="404" REF="013782_0417_0F91B301AE9D1B00"/>
were of note in society, and from thence o∣thers took more liberty: members of our so∣ciety worked in superfluities, and bought and sold them, and thus dimness of sight came over many. At length, friends got into the use of some superfluities in dress, and in the furniture of their houses, and this hath spread from less to more, till superfluity of some kinds is common amongst us.</P>
<P>In this declining state many look at the example one of another, and too much ne∣glect the pure feeling of truth. Of late years a deep exercise hath attended my mind, that friends may dig deep, may carefully cast forth the loose matter, and get down to the rock, the sure foundation, and there hearken to that divine voice which gives a clear and cer∣tain sound.</P>
<P>And I have felt in that which doth not de∣ceive, that if friends who have known the truth, keep in that tenderness of heart, where all views of outward gain are given up, and their trust is only on the Lord, he will gra∣ciously lead some to be patterns of deep self-denial, in things relating to trade, and han∣dicraft labour; and that some who have plenty of the treasures of this world, will ex∣ample in a plain frugal life, and pay wages to such whom they may hire, more liberally than is now customary in some places.</P>
<P>The prophet, speaking of the true church, said, <Q>Thy people also shall be all righte∣ous.</Q></P>
<P>Of the depth of this divine work several have spoken.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="013782_0418_0F91B30263CC6DC0"/>
John Gratton, in his journal, p. 45, said, "The Lord is my portion, I shall not want. He hath wrought all my works in me. I am nothing but what I am in him."</P>
<P>Gilbert Latey, through the powerful ope∣rations of the spirit of Christ in his soul, was brought to that depth of self-denial, that he could not join with that proud spirit in other people, which inclined them to want vanities and superfluities. This friend was often a∣mongst the chief rulers of the nation in times of persecution, and it appears by the testi∣mony of friends, that his dwelling was so e∣vidently in the pure life of truth, that in his visits to those great men, he found a place in their minds; and that king James the second, in the times of his troubles, made particular mention in a very respectful manner of what Gilbert once said to him.</P>
<P>The said Gilbert found a concern to write an epistle, in which are these expressions; "Fear the Lord, ye men of all sorts, trades, and callings, and leave off all the evil that is in them, for the Lord is grieved with all the evils used in your employments which you are exercised in."</P>
<P>"It is even a grief to see how you are ser∣vants to sin, and instruments of Satan." See his works, p. 42, &amp;c.</P>
<P>George Fox, in an epistle, writes thus: "Friends, stand in the eternal power of God, witnesses against the pomps and vani∣ties of this world."</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="013782_0419_0F91B3045D140BC8"/>
"Such tradesmen who stand as witnesses in the power of God, cannot fulfil the peo∣ple's minds in these vanities, and therefore they are offended at them."</P>
<P>"Let all trust in the Lord, and wait pa∣tiently on him; for when truth first broke forth in London, many tradesmen could not take so much money in their shops for some time, as would buy them bread and water, because they withstood the world's ways, fashions, and customs; yet by their patient waiting on the Lord in their good life and conversation, they answered the truth in peo∣ple's hearts, and thus their business increas∣ed." Book of Doctrinals, p. 824.</P>
<P>Now Christ our holy leader graciously con∣tinueth to open the understandings of his people, and as circumstances alter from age to age, some who are deeply baptized into a feeling of the state of things, are led by his holy spirit into exercises in some respect dif∣ferent from those which attended the faithful in foregoing ages, and through the constrain∣ings of pure love, are engaged to open the feelings they have to others.</P>
<P>In faithfully following Christ, the heart is weaned from the desire of riches, and we are led into a life so plain and simple, that a little doth suffice, and thus the way openeth to deny ourselves, under all the tempting al∣lurements of that gain, which we know is the gain of unrighteousness.</P>
<P>The apostle speaking on this subject, ask∣eth,
<PB N="407" REF="013782_0420_0F91B304A8EAE638"/>
this question; <Q>What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?</Q> 2 Cor. vi. 14. And again saith, <Q>Have no fellow∣ship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them,</Q> Ephes. v. 11. Again, <Q>Be not partaker of other men's sins, keep thyself pure.</Q> 1 Tim. v. 22.</P>
<P>Where people through the power of Christ are thoroughly settled in a right use of things, freed from all unnecessary care and expence, the mind in this true resignation is at liberty from the bands of a narrow self-interest, to attend from time to time on the movings of his spirit upon us, though he leads into that, through which our faith is closely tried.</P>
<P>The language of Christ is pure, and to the pure in heart, this pure language is intelligi∣ble; but in the love of money, the mind be∣ing intent on gain, is too full of human con∣trivance to attend to it.</P>
<P>It appeareth evident, that some channels of trade are defiled with unrighteousness, that the minds of many are intent on getting treasures to support a life, in which there are many unnecessary expences.</P>
<P>And I feel a living concern attend my mind, that under these difficulties we may humbly follow our heavenly shepherd, who graciously regardeth his flock, and is willing and able to supply us both inwardly and out∣wardly with clean provender, that hath been winnowed with the shovel and the fan, where we may <Q>sow to ourselves in righteousness,
<PB N="408" REF="013782_0421_0F91B30560C42F00"/>
reap in mercy,</Q> Hosea x. 12. and not be defiled with the works of iniquity.</P>
<P>Where customs contrary to pure wisdom are transmitted to posterity, it appears to be an injury committed against them; and I often feel tender compassion toward a young generation, and desires that their difficulties may not be increased through unfaithfulness in us of the present age.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On a Sailor's Life.</HEAD>
<P>IN the trade to Africa for slaves, and in the management of ships going on these voy∣ages, many of our lads and young men have a considerable part of their education.</P>
<P>Now what pious father beholding his son placed in one of these ships, to learn the prac∣tice of a mariner, could forbear mourning over him?</P>
<P>Where youth are exampled in means of getting money, so full of violence, and used to exercise such cruelties on their fellow-crea∣tures, the disadvantage to them in their edu∣cation is very great.</P>
<P>But I feel it in my mind to write concern∣ing the seafaring life in general.</P>
<P>In the trade carried on from the West-In∣dies, and from some parts of the continent,
<PB N="409" REF="013782_0422_0F91B306210BEA48"/>
the produce of the labour of slaves is a con∣siderable part.</P>
<P>And sailors who are frequently at ports where slaves abound, and converse often with people who oppress them without the appear∣ance of remorse, and often with sailors employ∣ed in the slave trade, how powerfully do these evil examples spread amongst the seafaring youth!</P>
<P>I have had many opportunities to feel and understand the general state of the seafaring life amongst us, and my mind hath often been sad on account of so many lads and young men being trained up amidst so great corruption.</P>
<P>Under the humbling power of Christ I have seen, that if the leadings of his holy spirit were faithfully attended to by his pro∣fessed followers in general, the heathen nati∣ons would be exampled in righteousness. A less number of people would be employed on the seas. The channels of trade would be more free from defilement. Fewer people would be employed in vanities and superflu∣ities.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of cities would be less in number.</P>
<P>Those who have much lands would become fathers to the poor.</P>
<P>More people would be employed in the sweet employment of husbandry, and in the path of pure wisdom, labour would be an a∣greeable, healthful employment.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="013782_0423_0F91B3076EE33450"/>
In the opening of these things in my mind, I feel a living concern that we who have felt divine love in our hearts may faithfully abide in it, and like good soldiers endure hardness for Christ's sake.</P>
<P>He, our blessed Saviour, exhorting his fol∣lowers to love one another, adds, <Q>As I have loved you.</Q> John xiii. 34.</P>
<P>He loved Lazarus, yet in his sickness did not heal him, but left him to endure the pains of death, that in restoring him to life, the people might be confirmed in the true faith.</P>
<P>He loved his disciples, but sent them forth on a message attended with great difficulty, amongst hard-hearted people, some of whom would think that in killing them they did God service.</P>
<P>So deep is divine love, that in stedfastly abiding in it, we are prepared to deny our∣selves of all that gain which is contrary to pure wisdom, and to follow Christ, even un∣der contempt, and through sufferings.</P>
<P>While friends were kept truly humble, and walked according to the purity of our prin∣ciples, the divine witness in many hearts was reached; but when a worldly spirit got en∣trance, therewith came in luxuries and su∣perfluities, and spread by little and little, even amongst the foremost rank in society, and from thence others took liberty in that way more abundantly.</P>
<P>In the continuation of these things from parents to children, there were many wants
<PB N="411" REF="013782_0424_0F91B307DD180B38"/>
to supply, even wants unknown to friends while they faithfully followed Christ. And in striving to supply these wants many have exacted on the poor, many have entered on employments, in which they often labour in upholding pride and vanity. Many have looked on one another, been strengthened in these things, one by the example of another, and as to the pure divine seeing, dimness hath come over many, and the channels of true brotherly love been obstructed.</P>
<P>People may have no intention to oppress, yet by entering on expensive ways of life, their minds may be so entangled therein, and so engaged to support expensive customs, as to be estranged from the pure sympathizing spirit.</P>
<P>As I have travelled in England, I have had a tender feeling of the condition of poor peo∣ple, some of whom though honest and indu∣strious, have nothing to spare toward paying for the schooling of their children.</P>
<P>There is a proportion between labour and the necessaries of life, and in true brotherly love the mind is open to feel after the neces∣sities of the poor.</P>
<P>Amongst the poor there are some that are weak through age, and others of a weakly nature, who pass through straits in very pri∣vate life, without asking relief from the publick.</P>
<P>Such who are strong and healthy may do that business, which to the weakly may be oppressive; and in performing that in a day
<PB N="412" REF="013782_0425_0F91B309D9CB68A8"/>
which is esteemed a day's labour, by weakly persons in the field and in the shops, and by weakly women who spin and knit in the manufactories, they often pass through wea∣riness; and many sighs I believe are uttered in secret, unheard by some who might ease their burdens.</P>
<P>Labour in the right medium is healthy, but in too much of it there is a painful wea∣riness; and the hardships of the poor are sometimes increased through want of more agreeable nourishment, more plentiful fewel for the fire, and warmer cloathing in the winter than their wages will answer.</P>
<P>When I have beheld plenty in some houses to a degree of luxury, the condition of poor children brought up without learning, and the condition of the weakly and aged, who strive to live by their labour, have often re∣vived in my mind, as cases of which some who live in fulness need to be put in remem∣brance.</P>
<P>There are few, if any, could behold their fellow-creatures lie long in distress and for∣bear to help them, when they could do it without any inconvenience; but customs re∣quiring much labour to support them, do often lie heavy on the poor, while they who live in these customs are so entangled in a multitude of unnecessary concerns, that they think but little of the hardships which the poor people go through.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On silent Worship.</HEAD>
<P>WORSHIP in silence hath often been refreshing to my mind, and a care attends me that a young generation may feel the nature of this worship.</P>
<P>Great expence ariseth in relation to that which is called divine worship.</P>
<P>A considerable part of this expence is ap∣plied toward outward greatness, and many poor people in raising of tithe, labour in sup∣porting customs contrary to the simplicity that there is in Christ, toward whom my mind hath often been moved with pity.</P>
<P>In pure silent worship, we dwell under the holy anointing, and feel Christ to be our shepherd.</P>
<P>Here the best of teachers ministers to the several conditions of his flock, and the soul receives immediately from the divine fountain, that with which it is nourished.</P>
<P>As I have travelled at times where those of other societies have attended our meetings, and have perceived how little some of them knew of the nature of silent worship; I have felt tender desires in my heart that we who often sit silent in our meetings, may live an∣swerable to the nature of an inward fellow∣ship with God, that no stumbling block through us, may be laid in their way.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="013782_0427_0F91B30AB8410BF8"/>
Such is the load of unnecessary expence which lieth on that which is called divine service in many places, and so much are the minds of many people employed in outward forms and ceremonies, that the opening of an inward silent worship in this nation to me hath appeared to be a precious opening.</P>
<P>Within the last four hundred years, many pious people have been deeply exercised in soul on account of the superstition which prevailed amongst the professed followers of Christ, and in support of their testimony a∣gainst oppressive idolatry, some in several ages have finished their course in the flames.</P>
<P>It appears by the history of the reformati∣on, that through the faithfulness of the mar∣tyrs, the understandings of many have been opened, and the minds of people, from age to age, been more and more prepared for a real spiritual worship.</P>
<P>My mind is often affected with a sense of the condition of those people, who in different ages have been meek and patient, following Christ through great afflictions: And while I behold the several steps of reformation, and that clearness, to which through divine good∣ness, it hath been brought by our ancestors; I feel tender desires that we who sometimes meet in silence, may never by our conduct lay stumbling-blocks in the way of others, and hinder the progress of the reformation in the world.</P>
<P>It was a complaint against some who were called the Lord's people, that they brought
<PB N="415" REF="013782_0428_0F91B30BEE0A0E78"/>
polluted bread to his altar, and said the table of the Lord was contemptible.</P>
<P>In real silent worship the soul feeds on that which is divine; but we cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and that table which is prepared by the God of this world.</P>
<P>If Christ is our shepherd, and feedeth us, and we are faithful in following him, our lives will have an inviting language, and the table of the lord will not be polluted.</P>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE QUARTERLY AND MONTHLY MEETINGS OF FRIENDS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FEELING at this time a renewed con∣cern that the pure principle of light and life, and the righteous fruits thereof may spread and prevail amongst mankind, there is an engagement on my heart to labour with my brethren in religious profession, that none of us may be a stumbling block in the way of others; but may so walk that our conduct may reach the pure witness in the hearts of such who are not in profession with us.</P>
<P>And, dear friends, while we publicly own that the holy Spirit is our leader, the profes∣sion is in itself weighty, and the weightiness thereof increaseth, in proportion as we are noted among the professors of truth, and
<PB N="417" REF="013782_0430_0F91B30EF62B3FA0"/>
active in dealing with such who walk disor∣derly.</P>
<P>Many under our profession for want of due attention, and a perfect resignation to this Divine Teacher, have in some things mani∣fested a deviation from the purity of our re∣ligious principles, and these deviations hav∣ing crept in amongst us by little and little, and increasing from less to greater, have been so far unnoticed, that some living in them, have been active in putting discipline in prac∣tice, with relation to others, whose conduct hath appeared more dishonourable in the world.</P>
<P>Now as my mind hath been exercised be∣fore the Lord, I have seen, that the disci∣pline of the church of Christ standeth in that which is pure; that it is the wisdom from above which gives authority to discipline; and that the weightiness thereof standeth not in any outward circumstances, but in the authority of Christ who is the author of it; and where any walk after the flesh, and not according to the purity of truth, and at the same time are active in putting discipline in practice, a veil is gradually drawn over the purity of discipline, and over that holiness of life, which Christ leads those into, <Q>in whom the love of God is verily perfected,</Q> 1 John ii. 5.</P>
<P>When we labour in true love with offend∣ers, and they remain obstinate, it sometimes is necessary to proceed as far as our Lord di∣rected,
<PB N="418" REF="013782_0431_0F91B30F211767B0"/>
<Q>Let him be to thee as an heathen man, or a publican,</Q> Mat. xviii. 17.</P>
<P>Now when such are disowned, and they who act therein feel Christ made unto them wisdom, and are preserved in his meek, re∣storing spirit, there is no just cause of offence ministred to any; but when such who are active in dealing with offenders indulge them∣selves in things which are contrary to the purity of truth, and yet judge others whose conduct appears more dishonourable than their's, here the pure authority of discipline ceaseth as to such offenders, and a temptati∣on is laid in their way to wrangle and con∣tend—<Q>Judge not, said our Lord, that ye be not judged.</Q> Now this forbidding, alludes to man's judgment, and points out the necessity of our humbly attending to that sanctifying power under which the faithful experience the Lord to be <Q>a spirit of judg∣ment to them,</Q> Isa. xxviii. 6. And as we feel his Holy Spirit to mortify the deeds of the body in us, and can say, <Q>it is no more I that live, but Christ that liveth in me,</Q> here right judgment is known.</P>
<P>And while divine love prevails in our hearts, and self in us is brought under judg∣ment, a preparation is felt to labour in a right manner with offenders; but if we a∣bide not in this love, our outward perform∣ance in dealing with others, degenerates into formality; for <Q>this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,</Q> John i. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="013782_0432_0F91B30FFA6F84B8"/>
How weighty are those instructions of our Redeemer concerning religious duties, when he points out, that they who pray, should be so obedient to the teachings of the Holy Spi∣rit, that humbly confiding in his help, they may say, <Q>Thy name O Father be hallowed! Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven:</Q>—In this aw∣ful state of mind is felt that worship which stands in doing the will of God, on earth, as it is done in heaven, and keeping the holy Name sacred. To take a holy profession upon us is awful, nor can we keep this holy Name sacred, but by humbly abiding under the cross of Christ. The apostle made a heavy complaint against some who prophaned this holy Name by their manner of living, <Q>thro' you, he says, the name of God is blas∣phemed amongst the Gentiles,</Q> Rom. ii. 24.</P>
<P>Some of our ancestors through many tri∣bulations were gathered into the state of true worshippers, and had fellowship in that which is pure, and as one was inwardly moved to kneel down in their assemblies, and publicly call on the name of the Lord, those in the harmony of united exercise then pre∣sent, joined in the prayer; I mention this in order that we of the present age, may look unto the Rock from whence we were hewn, and remember that to unite in worship, is a union in prayer, and that prayer acceptable to the Father is only in a mind truly sancti∣fied, where the sacred name is kept holy, and the heart resigned to do his will on earth as
<PB N="420" REF="013782_0433_0F91B310CC8EBCA8"/>
it is done in heaven, "If ye abide in me," saith Christ, <Q>and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will in my name, and it shall be done unto you.</Q>—Now we know not what to pray for as we ought, but as the Holy Spirit doth open and direct our minds, and as we faithfully yield to its in∣fluences, our prayers are in the will of our heavenly Father, who fails not to grant that which his own spirit, through his children, asketh;—thus preservation from sin is known, and the fruits of righteousness are brought forth by such who inwardly unite in prayer.</P>
<P>How weighty are our solemn meetings when the name of Christ is kept holy?</P>
<P>"How precious is that state in which the children of the Lord are so redeemed from the love of this world, that they are accepted and blessed in all that they do." R. Barclay's Apology, p. 404.</P>
<P>How necessary is it that we who profess these principles, and are outwardly active in supporting them, should faithfully abide in divine strength, that <Q>As He who hath call∣ed us, is holy, so we may be holy in all manner of conversation.</Q> 1 Pet. i. 15.</P>
<P>If one professing to be influenced by the spirit of Christ, proposeth to unite in a labour to promote righteousness in the earth, and in time past he hath manifestly deviated from the path of equity, then to act consistent with this principle, his first work is to make resti∣tution so far as he may be enabled; for if he attempts to contribute toward a work intend∣ed
<PB N="421" REF="013782_0434_0F91B311765FCCC0"/>
to promote righteousness, while it appears that he neglecteth, or refuseth to act righte∣ously himself, his conduct has a tendency to entangle the minds of those who are weak in the saith, who behold these things, and to draw a veil over the purity of righteousness, by carrying an appearance as though that was righteousness which is not.</P>
<P>Again, if I propose to assist in supporting those doctrines wherein that purity of life is held forth, in which customs proceeding from the spirit of this world have no place, and at the same time strengthen others in those customs by my example; the first step then in an orderly proceeding, is to cease from those customs myself, and afterwards to la∣bour, as I may be enabled, to promote the like disposition and conduct in others.</P>
<P>To be convinced of the pure principle of truth, and diligently exercised in walking answerable thereto, is necessary before I can consistently recommend this principle to o∣thers.—I often feel a labour in spirit, that we who are active members in religious so∣ciety may experience in ourselves the truth of those expressions of the Holy One—<Q>I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me.</Q> Lev. x. 3.—in this case, my mind hath been often exercised when alone, year after year, for many years, and in the re∣newings of divine love, a tender care hath been incited in me, that we who profess the inward principle of light to be our teacher, may be a family united in that purity of
<PB N="422" REF="013782_0435_0F91B31245C88F70"/>
worship, which comprehends a holy life, and ministers instruction to others.</P>
<P>My mind is often drawn towards children in the truth, who having a small share of the things of this life, and coming to have fa∣milies may be inwardly exercised before the Lord to support them in a way agreeable to the purity of truth, in which they may feel his blessing upon them in their labours; the thoughts of such being entangled with cus∣toms (contrary to pure wisdom) conveyed to them through our hands, doth often very tenderly and movingly affect my heart, and when I look towards and think on the suc∣ceeding generation, fervent desires are raised in me, that we by yielding to that Holy Spi∣rit which leads into all truth, may not do the work of the Lord deceitfully, may not live contrary to the purity of the divine prin∣ciple we profess; but that as faithful labour∣ers in our age, we may be instrumental in removing stumbling blocks out of the way of those who may succeed us.</P>
<P>So great was the love of Christ, that he gave himself for the church, <Q>that he might sanctify and cleanse it, that it should be holy, and without blemish, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing,</Q> Eph. v. 25. and where any take the name of Christ upon them, professing to be members of his church, and led by his Holy Spirit, and yet manifestly deviate from the purity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f truth, they herein act against the gracious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sign of his giving himself for them, and
<PB N="423" REF="013782_0436_0F91B312DF8E9148"/>
minister cause for the continuance of his af∣flictions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in his body the church.</P>
<P>Christ suffered afflictions in a body of flesh prepared by the father, but the afflictions of his mystical body are yet unfinished; for they who are baptized into Christ are bap∣tized into his death, and as we humbly abide under his sanctifying power, and are brought forth into newness of life, we feel Christ to live in us, who being the same yesterday, to-day, and forever, and always at unity with himself, his spirit in the hearts of his people leads to an inward exercise for the sal∣vation of mankind; and when under a tra∣vail of spirit, we behold a visited people en∣tangled by the spirit of this world with its wickedness and customs, and thereby ren∣dered incapable of being faithful examples to others, sorrow and heaviness under a sense of these things, is often experienced, and thus in some measure is filled up that which remains of the afflictions of Christ.</P>
<P>Our blessed Saviour speaking concerning gifts offered in divine service, says, <Q>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconcil∣ed to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</Q> Mat. v. 23, 24.—Now there is no true unity, but in that wherein the Father and the Son are united, nor can there be a perfect reconciliation but in ceasing from that which ministers cause for the con∣tinuation
<PB N="424" REF="013782_0437_0F91B3139DF40F70"/>
of the afflictions of Christ; and if any professing to bring their gift to the altar, do remember the customary contradiction which some of their fruits bear to the pure, spiritual worship, here it appears necessary to lay to heart this command, <Q>leave thy gift by the altar.</Q></P>
<P>Christ graciously calls his people brethren, <Q>whosoever shall do the will of God the same is my brother.</Q> Mark iii. 35. Now if we walk contrary to the truth as it is in Jesus while we continue to profess it, we offend against Christ, and if under this offence we bring our gift to the altar, our Redeemer doth not direct us to take back our gift, he doth not discourage our proceeding in a good work; but graciously points out the necessa∣ry means by which the gift may be rendered acceptable, "leave," saith he, <Q>thy gift by the altar, first go and be reconciled to thy brother,</Q> cease from that which grieves the Holy Spirit, cease from that which is a∣gainst the truth, as it is in Jesus, and then come, and offer thy gift.</P>
<P>I feel, while I am writing, a tenderness to those who through divine favour, are pre∣served in a lively sense of the state of the churches, and at times may be under dis∣couragements with regard to proceeding in that pure way which Christ by his Holy Spi∣rit leads into: the depth of disorder and weakness, which so much prevails, being o∣pened, doubtings are apt to arise as to the possibility of proceeding as an assembly of
<PB N="425" REF="013782_0438_0F91B31596788C58"/>
the Lord's people in the pure counsel of truth; and here I feel a concern to express in up∣rightness, that which hath been opened in my mind, under the power of the cross of Christ, relating to a visible gathered church, the members whereof are guided by the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>The church is called the body of Christ, Col. i. 25.</P>
<P>Christ is called the head of the church, Eph. i. 22.</P>
<P>The church is called the pillar, and ground of truth, 1 Tim. iii. 15.</P>
<P>Thus the church hath a name that is sa∣cred, and the necessity of keeping this name holy, appears evident; for where a number of people unite in a profession of being led by the spirit of Christ, and publish their prin∣ciples to the world, the acts and proceedings of that people may in some measure be con∣sidered as such which Christ is the author of.</P>
<P>Now while we stand in this station, if the pure light of life is not followed and regard∣ed in our proceedings, we are in the way of prophaning the holy Name, and of going back toward that wilderness of sufferings and persecution, out of which, through the tender mercies of God, a church hath been gather∣ed; "Christ liveth in sanctified vessels," Gal. ii. 20. and where they behold his holy Name profaned, and the pure gospel light eclipsed through the unfaithfulness of any who by their station appear to be standard bearers under the Prince of Peace, the living mem∣bers

in the body of Christ in beholding these things, do in some degree experience the fel∣lowship of his sufferings, and as the wisdom of the world more and more takes place in conducting the affairs of this visible gathered church, and the pure leadings of the Holy Spirit are less waited for and followed, so the true suffering seed is more and more oppres∣sed.</P>
<P>My mind is often affected with a sense of the condition of sincere hearted people in some kingdoms, where liberty of conscience is not allowed, many of whom being burthened in their minds with prevailing superstition, join∣ed with oppressions, are often under sorrow; and where such have attended to that pure light which hath in some degree opened their understandings, and for their faithfulness thereto, have been brought to examination and trial, how heavy are the persecutions which in divers parts of the world are exer∣cised upon them? How mighty, as to the outward, is that power by which they are borne down and oppressed?</P>
<P>How deeply affecting is the condition of many upright hearted people who are taken into the papal inquisition? What lamentable cruelties, in deep vaults, in a private way, are exercised on many of them? and how lingering is that death by a small slow fire, which they have frequently indured, who have been faithful to the end?</P>
<P>How many tender-spirited protestants have been sentenced to spend the remainder of their
<PB N="427" REF="013782_0440_0F91B316C2E2B560"/>
lives in a galley chained to oars, under hard-hearted masters, while their young children are placed out for education, and taught principles so contrary to the consciences of the parents, that by dissenting from them, they have hazarded their liberty, lives, and all that was dear to them of the things of this world?</P>
<P>There have been in time past severe perse∣cutions under the English government, and many sincere-hearted people have suffered death for the testimony of a good conscience, whose faithfulness in their day hath ministred encouragement to others, and been a blessing to many who have succeeded them; thus from age to age, the darkness being more and more removed, a channel at length, through the tender mercies of God, hath been opened for the exercise of the pure gift of the gospel mi∣nistry, without interruption from outward power, a work, the like of which is rare, and unknown in many parts of the world.</P>
<P>As these things are often fresh in my mind, and this great work of God going on in the earth has been open before me, that liberty of conscience with which we are favoured, hath appeared not as a light matter.</P>
<P>A trust is committed to us, a great and weighty trust, to which our diligent attenti∣on is necessary: wherever the active members of this visible gathered church use themselves to that which is contrary to the purity of our principles, it appears to be a breach of this trust, and one step back toward the wilder∣ness,
<PB N="428" REF="013782_0441_0F91B3175CE143C8"/>
one step towards undoing what God in infinite love hath done through his faithful servants, in a work of several ages, and is like laying the foundation for future suffer∣ings.</P>
<P>I feel a living invitation in my mind to such who are active in our religious society, that we may lay to heart this matter, and consider the station in which we stand; a place of outward liberty under the free exer∣cise of our conscience towards God, not ob∣tained but through great and manifold afflic∣tions of those who lived before us. There is gratitude due from us to our heavenly Fa∣ther, and justice to our posterity; can our hearts endure, or our hands be strong, if we desert a cause so precious, if we turn aside from a work under which so many have pa∣tiently laboured?</P>
<P>May the deep sufferings of our Saviour be so dear to us, that we may never trample un∣der foot the adorable Son of God, nor count the blood of the covenant unholy!</P>
<P>May the faithfulness of the martyrs when the prospect of death by fire was before them, be remembered! and may the patient con∣stant sufferings of the upright-hearted ser∣vants of God in latter ages be revived in our minds! and may we so follow on to know the Lord, that neither the faithful in this age, nor those in ages to come, may ever be brought under suffering, through our sliding back from the work of reformation in the world!</P>

While the active members in the visible gathered church stand upright, and the af∣fairs thereof are carried on under the leadings of the Holy Spirit, altho' disorders may arise among us, and cause many exercises to those who feel the care of the churches upon them; yet while these continue under the weight of the work, and labour in the meekness of wis∣dom for the help of others, the name of Christ in the visible gathered church may be kept sacred; but while they who are active in the affairs of this church, continue in a manifest opposition to the purity of our prin∣ciples, this as the prophet Isaiah x. 18. ex∣presseth it, is like <Q>as when a standard bear∣er sainteth:</Q> and thus the way opens to great, and prevailing degeneracy, and to sufferings for such who through the power of divine love, are separated to the gospel of Christ, and cannot unite with any thing which stands in opposition to the purity of it.</P>
<P>The necessity of an inward stillness, hath under these exercises appeared clear to my mind; in true silence strength is renewed, the mind herein is weaned from all things, but as they may be enjoyed in the divine will, and a lowliness in outward living op∣posite to worldly honour, becomes truly ac∣ceptable to us;—in the desire after outward gain, the mind is prevented from a perfect attention to the voice of Christ; but being weaned from all things, but as they may be enjoyed in the divine will, the pure light shines into the soul: and where the fruits of
<PB N="430" REF="013782_0443_0F91B318DCF037E8"/>
that spirit which is of this world, are brought forth by many who profess to be led by the spirit of truth, and cloudiness is felt to be gathering over the visible gathered church, the sincere in heart who abide in true stillness, and are exercised therein before the Lord for his name sake, have a knowledge of Christ in the fellowship of his sufferings, and in∣ward thankfulness is felt at times, that thro' divine love our own wisdom is cast out, and that forward active part in us subjected, which would rise and do something in the visible gathered church, without the pure leadings of the Spirit of Christ.</P>
<P>While aught remains in us different from a perfect resignation of our wills, it is like a seal to a book wherein is written <Q>that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God concerning us,</Q> Rom. xii. 2. but when our minds entirely yield to Christ, that silence is known, which followeth the open∣ing of the last of the seals, Rev. viii. 1. in this silence we learn abiding in the divine will, and there feel, that we have no cause to promote but that only in which the light of life directs us in our proceedings, and that the alone way to be useful in the church of Christ, is to abide faithfully under the lead∣ings of his Holy Spirit in all cases, and being preserved thereby in purity of heart, and ho∣liness of conversation, a testimony to the pu∣rity of his government may be held forth through us, to others.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="013782_0444_0F91B319D3583D70"/>
As my mind hath been thus exercised, I have seen that to be active, and busy in the visible gathered church, without the leadings of the Holy Spirit is not only unprofitable, but tends to increase dimness, and where way is not opened to proceed in the light of truth, a stop is felt by those who humbly at∣tend to the Divine Leader, a stop which in relation to good order in the visible gathered church, is of the greatest consequence to be observed; thus Robert Barclay in his treatise on discipline holds forth, page 65. 68. 84. "That the judgment or conclusion of the church or congregation, is no further effec∣tual as to the true end and design thereof, but as such judgment or conclusion proceeds from the Spirit of God operating on their minds who are sanctified in Christ Jesus."</P>
<P>Now in this stop I have learned the neces∣sity of waiting on the Lord in humility, that the works of all may be brought to light, and those to judgment which are wrought in the wisdom of this world, and have also seen, that in a mind thoroughly subjected to the power of the cross, there is a favour of life to be felt, which evidently tends to ga∣ther souls to God, while the greatest works in the visible gathered church brought forth in man's wisdom, remain to be unprofitable.</P>
<P>Where people are divinely gathered into a holy fellowship, and faithfully abide under the influence of that Spirit which leads into all truth, "they are the light of the world." Mat. v. 14. Now holding this profession, to
<PB N="432" REF="013782_0445_0F91B31A5CFD8628"/>
me hath appeared weighty, even beyond what I can fully express, and what our bles∣sed Lord seemed to have in view, when he proposed the necessity of counting the cost, before we begin to build.</P>
<P>I trust there are many who at times, under divine visitation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> inward enquiry af∣ter God, and when such in the simplicity of their hearts mark the lives of a people who profess to walk by the leadings of his Spirit, of what great concernment is it that our lights shine clear, that nothing of our con∣duct carry a contradiction to the truth as it is in Jesus, or be a means of profaning his holy Name, and be a stumbling block in the way of those sincere enquirers.</P>
<P>When such seekers who wearied with empty forms, look towards uniting with us as a people, and behold active members a∣mong us depart in their customary way of living, from that purity of life, which under humbling exercises hath been opened before them, as the way of the Lord's people, how mournful and discouraging is the prospect! and how strongly doth such unfaithfulness operate against the spreading of the peaceable, harmonious principle and testimony of truth amongst mankind?</P>
<P>In entering into that life, which is hid with Christ in God, we behold his peaceable government, where the whole family are go∣verned by the same spirit, and the <Q>doing to others as we would they should do un∣to us,</Q> groweth up as good fruit from a
<PB N="433" REF="013782_0446_0F91B31EA5374090"/>
good tree, the peace, quietness, and harmo∣nious walking in this government is beheld with humble reverence to him who is the author of it, and in partaking of the Spirit of Christ, we partake of that which labours, and suffers for the increase of this peaceable government among the inhabitants of the world; and I have felt a labour of long con∣tinuance that we who profess this peaceable principle, may be faithful standard bearers under the Prince of Peace, and that nothing of a defiling nature, tending to discord and wars, may remain among us.</P>
<P>May each of us query with ourselves, have the treasures I possess, been gathered in that wisdom which is from above, so far as hath appeared to me?</P>
<P>Have none of my fellow-creatures an equi∣table right to any part which is called mine?</P>
<P>Have the gifts, and possessions received by me from others been conveyed in a way free from all unrighteousness so far as I have seen?</P>
<P>The principle of peace in which our trust is only on the Lord, and our minds weaned from a dependance on the strength of armies, hath appeared to me very precious, and I often feel strong desires, that we who pro∣fess this principle, may so walk, as to give just cause for none of our fellow-creatures to be offended at us; that our lives may evi∣dently manifest, that we are redeemed from that spirit in which wars are: our blessed Saviour in pointing out the danger of so
<PB N="434" REF="013782_0447_0F91B31FD3DE2A98"/>
leaning on man, as to neglect the leadings of his Holy Spirit, said, <Q>Call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your fa∣ther which is in heaven,</Q> Mat. xxiii. 9. where the wisdom from above is faithfully followed, and therein we are entrusted with substance, it is a treasure committed to our care in the nature of an inheritance, as an inheritance from him, who formed, and sup∣ports the world. Now in this condition the true enjoyment of the good things of this life is understood, and that blessing felt, in which is real safety; this is what I apprehend our blessed Lord had in view, when he pronounc∣ed, <Q>Blessed are the meek, for they shall in∣herit the earth.</Q></P>
<P>Selfish worldly minded men may hold lands in the selfish spirit, and depending on the strength of the outward power, be perplexed with secret uneasiness, lest the injured should sometime overpower them, and that measure meted to them, which they measure to others.—Thus selfish men may possess the earth; but it is the meek who inherit it, and enjoy it as an inheritance from the heavenly Fa∣ther, free from all the defilements and per∣plexities of unrighteousness.</P>
<P>Where proceedings have been in that wis∣dom which is from beneath, and inequitable gain gathered by a man, and left as a gift to his children, who being entangled by the same worldly spirit, have not attained to that clearness of light in which the channels of righteousness are opened, and justice done to
<PB N="435" REF="013782_0448_0F91B3206FEEA528"/>
those who remain silent under injuries: here I have seen under humbling exercise of mind, that the sins of the fathers are embraced by the children, and become their sins, and thus in the days of tribulation, the iniquities of the fathers are visited upon these children, who take hold of the unrighteousness of their fathers, and live in that spirit in which those iniquities were committed; to which agreeth the prophecy of Moses, concerning a rebel∣lious people. <Q>They that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquities, in your enemy's land, and in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away.</Q> Lev. xxvi. 39. and our blessed Lord in beholding the hard∣ness of heart in that generation, and feeling in himself, that they lived in the same spirit in which the prophets had been persecuted unto death, signified, <Q>that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world, should be requir∣ed of that generation, from the blood of Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple.</Q> Luke xi. 51.</P>
<P>Tender compassion fills my heart toward my fellow creatures estranged from the har∣monious government of the Prince of Peace, and a labour attends me, that they may be gathered to this peaceable habitation.</P>
<P>In being inwardly prepared to suffer adver∣sity for Christ's sake, and weaned from a de∣pendance on the arm of flesh, we feel, that there is a rest for the people of God, and
<PB N="436" REF="013782_0449_0F91B3215392BA18"/>
that it stands in a perfect resignation of our∣selves to his holy Will; in this condition, all our wants and desires are bounded by pure wisdom, and our minds wholly attentive to the council of Christ inwardly communicated, which hath appeared to me as a habitation of safety for the Lord's people, in times of outward commotion and trouble, and desires from the fountain of pure love, are opened in me, to invite my brethren and fellow creatures to feel for, and seek after that which gathers the mind into it.</P>
