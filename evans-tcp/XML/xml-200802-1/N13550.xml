<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM XLVII. 8, 9.</BIBL>
<Q>—GOD sitteth upon the throne of his holiness: The Princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the GOD of <HI>Abraham;</HI> for the Shields of the earth belong unto GOD: He is greatly exalted,</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT what time, or upon what occasion, the Psalm before us was composed, is neither certain, nor easy, at this distance of time, to determine.—"Many have supposed it to have been pen∣ned, on occasion of bringing up the <HI>Ark</HI> to <HI>Mount Zion.</HI>"—Others, "that it looks further, and is prophetick of the ascension of the <HI>glo∣rious Mediator,</HI> after he had finished his work on earth, and the setting up his kingdom in the world."</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="017114_0005_0FA02F5C6AC36B10"/>
FROM the sentiments it contains, it might also be considered as a Psalm composed, and well adapted, for the congregation of <HI>Israel,</HI> when all the tribes came to <HI>Hebron</HI> to receive <HI>David,</HI> and by their <HI>elders</HI> to <HI>make a league with him,</HI> as their <HI>chief magistrate;</HI> and to establish him in the government.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 5. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT, which, or whether either of these suppositions hath any solid foundation, must be left to the learned and judicious to deter∣mine.—Be the primary occasion, of this <HI>devout composition,</HI> what it may; it is beyond dispute, that the subjects of it are interesting and important:—Subjects well suited to in∣spire the church and people of GOD, at all times, with a sense of his government and their dependence, and of their indispensible obligations to celebrate the glories of his perfections, herein displayed, as the ground of their confidence and theme of their praise.</P>
<P>IN a word, it is an exhortation to <HI>the peo∣ple of GOD,</HI> to praise the LORD, as "<HI>The Great King over all the earth,</HI>" who should <HI>subdue the people,</HI> their enemies and oppressors <HI>under them, and the nations under their feet:</HI> And as that GOD, who should <HI>choose their inheritance for them,</HI> and establish them in the quiet possession and enjoyment of it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="017114_0006_0FA02F5D9AF7C730"/>
AGREEABLY, in confirmation of this their confidence, it is said, in the text—That <HI>GOD sitteth upon the throne of his holiness: The Princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the GOD of</HI> Abraham; <HI>for the Shields of the earth belong unto GOD: He is greatly exalted.</HI></P>
<P>IN these words, we have a striking repre∣sentation,—a lively portrait of the happy state of a people, or nation, in covenant with GOD, and favoured with his protection and smiles; of a people established in the enjoyment of the blessings of a <HI>civil government,</HI> whose constitution is founded in principles of liberty and equity, whose laws are administred with justice and righteousness, and whose end is the glory of GOD, in the good of mankind. <HI>The Great GOD,</HI> as the sovereign, the su∣preme ruler, <HI>sitting on the throne of his holi∣ness,</HI> with all the powers of government, originally and ultimately, vested in himself, and exercised by him, agreeable to the eternal laws of righteousness and equity.—<HI>The Prin∣ces of the people,</HI> their leaders, or deligates, <HI>are gathered together,</HI> from all parts of the land, in the name of their constituents, and under the direction and influence of their supreme ruler and sovereign, to consult the public weal, to enact laws and to transact the great affairs of the nation and of government. The people, the body of the nation, are there introduced, as <HI>The people of the GOD of
<PB N="4" REF="017114_0007_0FA02F5DEDA103D8"/>
Abraham,</HI> in covenant with him, and devout∣ly acknowledging their fealty to him, as their sovereign, and their dependence upon him and his blessing, both for counsel and de∣fence. And in fine, that nothing might be wanting to compleat the view, we have <HI>The Shields of the earth,</HI> representing both the powers of government and the persons vested with them, exhibited, as <HI>belonging to GOD,</HI> religiously devoted to his service and glory, or under his direction and controul, to carry to effect the purposes of his benevolence and wisdom for the good of his people, or the designs of his justice and righteousness in the government of the world.—The whole is intended to show—'That magistracy, or civil government, is of divine institution—'That the end of it is the good of the governed—and 'That, as all power and all authority are derived from him, the glory of all should redound to his name; to the end, that <HI>GOD,</HI> who <HI>sitteth on the throne might be greatly exalted.</HI></P>
<P>THAT GOD, who created and preserves, of right, doth govern the world, is a truth, which the light of nature teaches, which revelation confirms, and a truth, which the common sense of mankind in all ages, concurs to establish.</P>
<P>THAT the power, authority and sovereign∣ty of GOD are absolute and uncontroulable is a truth justly deducible from the preceed∣ing, and equally indisputable.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017114_0008_0FA02F5F230DDC98"/>
THE sacred scriptures are far from being silent, or doubtful, upon a subject so funda∣mental, so important. We frequently find all the powers of moral government, in the highest sense, solemnly assumed by GOD, or devoutly ascribed unto him, in the divine oracles. Hence GOD is introduced by the holy prophet, as saying, "I am the LORD, and there is none else; there is no GOD besides me. I form the light and create darkness: I make peace and create evil: I the LORD do all these things."<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Isai. 45 5. 7.</NOTE> "I will work, and who shall let it?"<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 43, 13</NOTE>—And to show the vanity of oppugnation to his government or authority, it is added,—"Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth: But wo to him that striveth with his maker."<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 45 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND what GOD hath thus justly assumed, is devoutly ascribed to him by his saints and people; and frequently mentioned as the ground of their confidence, as well as the reason of their submission.—At all times, yea, even in times of perplexity and darkness, it was the language of GOD's people—"The LORD reigneth, let the earth rejoice"<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. 97. 1.</NOTE>—"The LORD is our judge, the LORD is our law∣giver, the LORD is our king; He will save us."<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Isai.</NOTE> Holy <HI>David</HI> observes, that "the king∣dom is the LORD's, and he is governor among the nations."<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Psal. 22. 28.</NOTE> and to add no more, it is
<PB N="6" REF="017114_0009_0FA02F5F685B7B60"/>
said—That "The LORD sitteth King for∣ever:"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. 29, 10.</NOTE> And, that "His Kingdom ruleth over all."<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">103, 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN this light considered, the Deity is to be acknowledged, as that GOD, whose power and authority are supreme, universal and un∣controulable.</P>
<P>IT is not, however, authority or power alone, that forms the character, or gives an idea of the great moral governor of the uni∣verse; but this power, and this authority, as tempered with wisdom, goodness, justice, truth, faithfulness, and other moral perfecti∣ons necessary to a government founded in equity, exercised in righteousness, glorious to himself and a blessing to his creatures.</P>
<P>IT would have been easy to an infinite being, to have carried to effect the purposes of his government, by the influences of his spirit, or the word of his power; but, for wise reasons, the supreme Ruler <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath been pleased to employ angels and men, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mini∣sters in his kingdom; and to render even second causes subservient to the great designs of his wisdom, justice and goodness, in the government of the world.</P>
<P>FOR the glory of GOD, and the preserva∣tion of order and communication of happiness,
<PB N="7" REF="017114_0010_0FA02F631CC3EFF8"/>
It is both natural and rational to suppose, that government subsists among intelligent beings, of whatever rank, or degree in creation.</P>
<P>THIS conjecture is the more probable, with regard to the heavenly hosts, and those bright intelligencies, who inhabit the celestial abodes, and are favoured with the nearest approaches unto GOD, from the account the sacred ora∣cles have given; of the various names, orders and degrees subsisting among them; as <HI>Angels, Arch-angels, Thrones, Dominions, Principali∣ties</HI> and <HI>Powers.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Col. 1. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOMETHING of this kind, also, would, undoubtedly, have been advantageous, if not necessary, to have perfected the felicity of mankind, had they continued in a state of innocence and rectitude: And for the order, harmony and happiness of society and the world, it is reasonable to suppose, that rule and government would have taken place among men, however virtuous, benevolent, or just.</P>
<P>THE still greater importance of such an institution to the peace, liberty, safety and happiness of individuals, of society and the world of mankind, since sin, lust, passion, imperfection and every evil work have been introduced, needs neither time to consider, nor arguments to prove.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017114_0011_0FA02F645DBF14F0"/>
WERE there no civil government, laws, magistracy, nor <HI>Shields of the earth,</HI> for the preservation of peace, the guard of liberty, the protection of property and the defence of life, it is easy to see, and, without a spirit of prophesy, to foretell, what the event must be:—that anarchy, confusion, blood and slaughter, waste and destruction, would soon take place in the earth.—The weak would be devoured by the strong, the innocent, like <HI>righteous Abel,</HI> would become an easy prey to the vicious, abandoned and ambitious:—and the longest sword must quickly determine the fate of mankind.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, I had almost said, to a demonstration, that, under GOD, the supreme ruler, this wise institution of <HI>civil government,</HI> this richest of temporal blessings to mankind, takes its rise from <HI>Necessity.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, reason teaches the propriety, convenience points out the advantages, and all the social affections concur to urge the im∣portance of civil government. But however engaging or interesting these arguments might appear, to the wise, the benevolent, or judi∣cious, they would be, at best, but a feeble support to the peace and order of society,—would never have availed to establish govern∣ment, over the lawless lusts of vicious, aspi∣ring, or blood-thirsty men.—It is <HI>Necessity, Necessity alone,</HI> which combines men in
<PB N="9" REF="017114_0012_0FA02F655E03E238"/>
society, and gives rise to civil government. And had not mankind been effectually con∣vinced of <HI>this necessity,</HI> and taught to realize that there was no living without it, it is very much a doubt, whether ever such an institu∣tion would have taken place in the world.</P>
<P>THIS Necessity, in a great measure at least, is founded in and takes rise from the lusts, the corruptions and vices of mankind.</P>
<P>'TIS not indeed pretended, that any one man, or any number of men, have any natural right of superiority, or inherent claim of domi∣nion, or governmental authority over any other man, or body of men.—All men, by nature, are <HI>free, equal</HI> and <HI>independent,</HI> in this matter. It is in compact—<HI>in compact alone,</HI> that all just government is founded.</P>
<P>THE first steps, in entering into society and toward the establishment of civil government among a people, is the forming, agreeing to, and ratifying an <HI>original compact,</HI> for the regu∣lation of the State, describing and determining the mode, departments and powers of govern∣ment, and the rights, privileges and duties of the subjects.</P>
<P>THIS should be done by the whole body of the people; or by princes, leaders, or dele∣gates, by their choice, appointment, or con∣sent.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="017114_0013_0FA02F6573756E70"/>
THIS right in the people, whether emer∣ging from a state of nature, or the yoke of oppression, is <HI>an unalienable right</HI>—a right which cannot be given up by a people, even though ever so much inclined to sell or sacri∣fice it.—Yea, should a people be so lost to themselves, as, upon any consideration, to give it up, it may justly be <HI>re-claimed,</HI> at least by the next generation, who cannot be supposed to be deprived of <HI>their birth-right,</HI> because their progenitors, like <HI>Esau,</HI> despised and par∣ted with theirs.</P>
<P>WHILE the <HI>social compact</HI> subsists, the whole state, and all its members, are bound by it:—a sacred regard ought to be paid to it. No man, order, or body of men, in the state, have any right, power, or authority, to alter, change, or violate the social compact. Nor can any change, alteration, or amendment, be lawful∣ly introduced, but by common consent. Any and every attempt of this kind, endangers the whole.</P>
<P>IT remains, however, with the communi∣ty, state, or nation, as a public, <HI>political body,</HI> at any time, at pleasure, to change, alter, or even totally dissolve the constitution, and re∣turn to a state of nature, or to form anew, as to them shall seem meet.</P>
<P>THESE principles admitted, it is evident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no man, or body of men, however wise,
<PB N="11" REF="017114_0014_0FA02F6641566840"/>
great or good;—no state, nation, or power on earth, hath any right to make or impose a constitution of government upon another state or nation: Such a constitution, however free, is a <HI>mark</HI> of dependence, a <HI>badge of slavery,</HI> the most distant thought of which the high spirit of a free people would justly despise.</P>
<P>EQUALITY and INDEPENDENCE are the <HI>just claim,</HI> the <HI>indefeasible birth-right</HI> of men:—In a state of nature, as individuals; in society, as states or nations.—Nothing short of these ever did, or ever will satisfy a man or a people, <HI>truly free, truly brave.</HI></P>
<P>TRUE it is, a conquered nation is obliged to submit to the terms, the laws, the conquer∣or is pleased to impose: But this being matter of compulsion and not of choice, alters not the right. The claim to liberty and indepen∣dence remains the same. When opportunity offers, and power is attained, it is, beyond dis∣pute, the <HI>duty,</HI> as well as right, of such a peo∣ple, of such a nation, to assert their <HI>native li∣berty,</HI> to shake off the <HI>tyrant'</HI>s yoke, to main∣tain their equality and independence among the nations; and either resume their former, or establish a new constitution of government, as they shall judge best.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, this is a right, the viola∣tion or infringement of which, upon any con∣sideration whatever, no man can justify upon
<PB N="12" REF="017114_0015_0FA02F66E9967C00"/>
the principles of reason, the laws of nature, or rules of equity.—Even GOD himself, the su∣preme ruler of the world, whose government is absolute and uncontroulable, hath ever paid a sacred attention to this <HI>important right;</HI> hath ever patronised this <HI>interesting claim</HI> in the sons of men.</P>
<P>THE only constitution of civil government that can plead its origin, as immediately from heaven, is, <HI>The Theocracy of the Hebrews.</HI> But even this form of government, though dictated by <HI>infinite wisdom,</HI> and wrote with the <HI>finger of</HI> GOD, was laid before his people for their consideration, and ratified, introduced and e∣stablished by their common consent.</P>
<P>WHAT form of government will answer the best purposes to society, and most effectu∣ally display the glory of the supreme Ruler, in the good of mankind, is a question truly deli∣cate and important; and a question, which, in the hand of a <HI>masterly politician,</HI> might admit of a discussion both interesting and entertain∣ing. But as neither time, nor capacity, will permit me to enter largely into so high and critical a subject; it shall suffice to observe,—</P>
<P>THAT a little acquaintance with the world and the history of mankind, in the several a∣ges past, will clearly decide, that no one con∣stitution, or form of civil government, can be supposed to be equally adopted to answer the
<PB N="13" REF="017114_0016_0FA02F67BAF4FCB0"/>
best purposes of such an institution, in every society, nation or state.</P>
<P>THAT in the rise and progress of society, different modes of government have been a∣dopted and introduced, at different stages and successive periods, cannot be doubted.—And whether there hath not been, in many instan∣ces, at least, a gradation in the modes of go∣vernment, keeping pace with the progress of society, in the several ages of the world, simi∣lar to that gradation, which is easily observed in the several stages and periods of human life; is a question, with all deference, submitted to the candor and judgment of this respectable assembly.</P>
<P>AT first sight, indeed, this circumstance may not have been observed; nor can it be said to have been the case, without many ex∣ceptions. But, in an attentive review of the history of mankind, have we not seen, in va∣rious instances, a people emerging from a state of nature, and perhaps obscurity, with all the life, vigor, heat and zeal, as well as undisgui∣sed simplicity of youth, entering into society; and their pulse beating high for <HI>liberty,</HI> form∣ing the <HI>social compact</HI> upon principles of <HI>free∣dom,</HI> and establishing a constitution <HI>purely po∣pular</HI>—A form of <HI>civil government,</HI> in which every man considers himself a part of the au∣thority, having a right to give his voice upon every law, measure, or public act of the state?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="017114_0017_0FA02F686896A3E8"/>
IN a succeeding stage, have we not seen a people, perhaps the same, by gradual altera∣tions and improvements, or by some thorough reform or revolution, like man arrived at ma∣ture age, for wisdom, firmness and strength, establishing <HI>true liberty</HI> and <HI>a settled civil go∣vernment,</HI> upon the more <HI>permanent Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> of a FREE COMMONWEALTH? And under this happy form, flourishing for ages, and in the unmolested enjoyment of the sweets of freedom and the blessings of government, ri∣sing to the height of strength and dignity, prosperity and glory?</P>
<P>MOREOVER, Have we not seen, at some distant period, this same society, state or na∣tion, like man passed the meridian of life, and beginning to feel the infirmities of age ap∣proaching, by insinuating corruptions, by the influence of parties, the malevolence of fac∣tions, and frequent disorders, warned of its danger, and reduced to the necessity of strength∣ening the bands of society, and the powers of government, by a monarchial constitution; and putting the reins into the hands of a so∣vereign, with certain limitations, to guard, as much as may be, the liberty of the subject and freedom of the state?</P>
<P>IN fine;—Have we not seen, in the closing period, the same society, state, or nation, like man, in the decline of life, bowed with the infirmities of age and time, the constitution
<PB N="15" REF="017114_0018_0FA02F6927D9E398"/>
broken; the spirit of virtue, wisdom, liberty and firmness gone; the <HI>political body,</HI> filled with vicious humours, attacked by painful diseases, rack'd with malignant disorders, which surpass the <HI>political physician'</HI>s skill to heal or remedy? In a word, convulsed to the very foundations, by internal oppressions and violences, by public tumults and commotions; and divided and rent by the furious factions of wicked, designing, artful and ambitious men, tending to and ending in <HI>blood-shed, slaughter</HI> and <HI>civil wars,</HI> which nothing but the hand and sword of absolute power could restrain, quiet or controul—and thus prepared to be an easy prey to the <HI>daring tyrant,</HI> whose hand could seize, whose sword could secure it!!</P>
<P>IT is not, indeed, pretended, that this hath been statedly or literally the case, with nations that have entered into society, and established civil government in the world.—But whether, in the rise and progress of society, and the modes of government which have been adopt∣ed by mankind, something of this kind hath not appeared, in various instances? And whe∣ther this, or some similar gradation in the con∣stitutions of government, at the several periods and stages of society, are not natural and ne∣cessary, rational and just; and, upon the whole, for the best,—is humbly submitted to the learned, the wise and judicious to consider.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="017114_0019_0FA02F69E7EAC000"/>
CERTAIN it is, that as different societies and states may require different modes of go∣vernment; so the same societies or nations may require different constitutions, at distinct and distant periods and stages of their exist∣ence.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Brutus</HI> the Elder greatly dared to attempt a <HI>radical revolution,</HI> from an <HI>arbitra∣ry</HI> to a <HI>free</HI> government, by the expulsion of the <HI>Tarquins,</HI> and the establishment of a com∣monwealth at <HI>Rome;</HI> the virtue of his fellow-citizens, seconded and supported him: And the glorious plan was carried to effect to the inexpressible joy of every friend to liberty, to his country and the rights of mankind.—But when, from the same <HI>patriotic</HI> principles, <HI>Bru∣tus</HI> the Younger, by the death of <HI>Julius Cae∣sar,</HI> several ages afterwards, nobly attempted the deliverance of his country from the <HI>shac∣kles of tyranny,</HI> and the <HI>oppressor's yoke;</HI> and to re-establish a free government; the virtue of his fellow-citizens failed him; and <HI>Rome</HI> was enslaved, never—<HI>never</HI> to enjoy the bles∣sings of <HI>liberty</HI> or a <HI>free government</HI> more!—And this was <HI>her choice!</HI>—otherwise she would have roused, seconded and supported the arms and attempts of so faithful a friend and so valiant an <HI>hero,</HI> in the glorious cause of freedom and his country.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the propriety or impro∣priety of this or that constitution or mode of
<PB N="17" REF="017114_0020_0FA02F6BFAF984D8"/>
government, for this people or another, de∣pends upon a variety of circumstances; such as character, situation, manners, customs, trade, connections, &amp;c.—of which the people, are, or, most certainly, ought to be the best, if not the only competent judges.—And happy is that people, who, having the opportunity, have wisdom to discern and virtue to pursue their true interest, in a matter of so interest∣ing a nature, and such lasting importance.</P>
<P>MYSTERIES in government, <HI>secrets of state,</HI>—those <HI>Arcana Imperii,</HI> by which the artful and ambitious have inslaved the great∣er part of mankind, are totally abhorrent to all principles of liberty, and naturally tend to sap the foundations of civil government, in a free commonwealth.</P>
<P>A people have an <HI>unalienable</HI> right to know the constitution they enjoy, the go∣vernment they are under, the laws they are subject to, and what is justly expected and required of them as subjects.</P>
<P>NEXT to a good constitution, therefore, the <HI>laws of the land</HI> are the inheritance of the people.—All laws should bear a resem∣blance and carry the features, of the consti∣tution; being deduced from its principles and founded in its maxims. And, if I may be allowed the expression, the laws should flow from the constitution, as the streams from
<PB N="18" REF="017114_0021_0FA02F6D2F4B8B40"/>
fountain, and even <HI>grow out of it,</HI> as the tree from the root, or the branches from the stock.</P>
<P>IT is also necessary to the well-being of society, that laws be adapted to the state and necessities of a people, and to the circumstan∣ces and exigencies of the community.</P>
<P>IT is of no small importance to the liber∣ty of the subject, as well as the support of governmental authority, in a free common∣wealth, that laws be as few in number, and as plain, concise and expressive, in their form, as possible.</P>
<P>IT hath been often said, 'The more laws, the less government.'—The institutions of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> the great founder of civil govern∣ment in <HI>Sparta,</HI> and the laws of <HI>Solon,</HI> the wise lawgiver of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> under the happy influence of which those states, from small beginnings, rose to the heighth of strength and glory, were few, plain, concise and expressive.</P>
<P>WHEN laws become numerous, or volu∣minous, it indicates the decline of virtue, the weakness of government and increase of vice.—For laws, taking life from necessity, hold up to view the vices, or crimes, they are intended to suppress, as the reason of their existence.—Several ages passed, in the republick of <HI>Rome,</HI> before any law existed
<PB N="19" REF="017114_0022_0FA02F6EF4EC7E10"/>
for the punishment of a <HI>Parricide;</HI> evident∣ly taking for granted, either, that this crime had never been thought of, or that it was of so atrocious a nature, that no <HI>Roman</HI> could be so debased as even to commit it.</P>
<P>I only add, that to render laws effectual, to the purposes of their existence, it hath ever been the care of the wisest legislators, espe∣cially in <HI>free states,</HI> to have such penalties annexed as are, not only apportioned to the malignity, but, as near as possible, expressive of the nature, of the crimes they are intend∣ed to punish, or suppress.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Whether the multiplying sanguinary laws and capital punishments, in a state, can be justified upon the prin∣ciples of equity, or even sound policy, is a question not unworthy the attention of wise legislators.—And whether punishing certain offenders, with loss of li∣berty, and hard labour, <HI>at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> or elsewhere, in some places of public re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, where they might be held up to view, as <HI>spectacles</HI> of justice <HI>in terrorem</HI> for a certain term of years, or for life, according to the nature of their crimes, would not answer the ends of government &amp; the purposes of civil society, better than even an <HI>ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minious death;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> submitted.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT laws, however good in themselves, or wisely adapted to the state and necessities of a people, can be of but little advantage, unless duly observed and carried to effect. Hence the necessity of appointing certain persons to be rulers, of investing them with power and cloathing them with authority, to administer government, and carry the laws into execution.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="017114_0023_0FA02F6F395FE978"/>
CIVIL government, duly established and organized, is fitly compared to a <HI>Shield,</HI> as it is instituted for the defence and protection of the subjects and the state. And hence rulers and magistrates, being vested and in∣trusted with the powers of government, are, with great propriety termed <HI>Shields of the earth,</HI> in the words of our text.—And as the powers of government give existence to the ruler, to the magistrate: So it is with rulers and magistrates to give life to the constitution and energy to the laws, by a faithful admi∣stration.</P>
<P>GOOD and faithful rulers are raised above their brethren, to places of honour, trust and authority, not for themselves, but for the people, and the good of society. They are intrusted with several powers of government, that individuals may be protected and defen∣ded in their life, liberty, property and rights—that the internal peace and order of society might be preserved; and that the external defence, of the whole, against the encroach∣ments, violence, assaults, or invasions of ene∣mies, or oppressors, might effectually be pro∣vided for.</P>
<P>IN this way, wise and faithful rulers are <HI>Shields</HI> to the state, and <HI>Shields of the earth;</HI> as by this happy institution, under their admi∣nistration, the wisdom and strength of the whole state, may, at any time, be collected in
<PB N="21" REF="017114_0024_0FA02F6FFB6AEC18"/>
defence of the public, or of any part of the community, as occasion may require. And thus every member is engaged for the peace, safety and defence of the state; and the whole for the peace, safety and protection of every member: For these obligations are mutual, and equally sacred and binding.</P>
<P>IN this light considered, rulers, by accept∣ing a seat or an office in government, are fitly said to pledge themselves, their faith and sacred honour, and that in the most solemn manner, to the people for their fidelity: and to them are they accountable.</P>
<P>BUT there is another argument, of yet higher importance, suggested in our text, which demands the attention of rulers of whatever station; and may not be passed over in silence.</P>
<P>IT is said, in the words before us,—<HI>the Shields of the earth belong unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>CIVIL government, as hath been said, is of <HI>divine institution.</HI> GOD, as Supreme, <HI>sit∣teth on the throne of his holiness.</HI> All power, rule, or authority is derived from GOD. In the government of society, states and nations, men are employed to carry his purposes of wisdom and goodness to effect. And hence civil rulers are fitly stiled—"the ministers of

<P>'TIS GOD, by his spirit and providence, who qualifies, raiseth up and calls them forth to publick view, in places of honour, trust and importance, in the various departments of government.—Men indeed, may act freely in all their elections and appointments.—But after all, a divine agency attends them:—An all-superintending providence is religiously to be acknowledged.—"the lot" saith the wise man—"the lot is cast into the lap: But the whole disposing thereof, is of the LORD."<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> 16, 33.</NOTE> And in terms yet more nervous and expressive, the Psalmist tells us, that "promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south: But GOD is the judge.

<P>CIVIL rulers, the Shields of the earth, <HI>belong unto the LORD,</HI> as the end of their ad∣ministration is the glory of GOD, and that <HI>he might be greatly exalted,</HI> in the good of man∣kind.—Hence the apostle—<HI>He is the minister of GOD to thee for good.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. 13. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN fine; civil rulers, <HI>the Shields of the earth, belong unto GOD,</HI> as they are under his immediate inspection, as they are account∣able to him for the whole of their conduct, in this character, and as their reward is with him, "GOD standeth," saith the psalmist "in the congregation of the mighty: He judgeth among the GODS."<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. 10. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>DEEPLY penetrated with a sense of the im∣portance of these considerations, a good ruler hath the most engaging, as well as awakening, motives, to a faithful discharge of duty, and the most substantial arguments to support him, under the weight and care of government.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, readily admitted, that rulers, in devoting the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, talents and capacities
<PB N="24" REF="017114_0027_0FA02F726A4B9F18"/>
to the service of the public, have a just claim to respect and support; and, in an upright discharge of their trust, they have a right, not only to a <HI>pecuniary reward,</HI> in proportion to the dignity of their stations, and importance of their services; but also to the grateful ac∣ceptance and chearful approbation of an obli∣ged people. And it is very happy indeed, for both rulers and people, when it may be truly said of persons in authority, as of <HI>Mordecai,</HI> of old—that "they are great among their fellow citizens, and accepted of the multitude of their brethren, seeking the wealth of their people, and speaking peace to all their seed."<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI> 10, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT should faithful rulers fail of so just, as well as pleasing, a return, as hath sometimes been the case, they are not without support, encouragement, or reward.</P>
<P>THE fear of GOD, the sentiments of religi∣on, the approbation of their own minds, the acceptance of their judge and the rewards of his kingdom, are sufficient to support them under every weight, and to excite them to fidelity and perseverance, under every discou∣ragement.—Neither the frowns of the great, nor the flatteries of the multitude; nor yet, <HI>the more pleasing charms of future promotion,</HI> will ever be permitted to influence the mea∣sures, or direct the conduct of the <HI>faithful ruler,</HI> acting under the influence of those exal∣ted

But, realizing what he owes to GOD, and what his country may justly require, he is faithful to the one, and true to the other, even though the <HI>Ostracism</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>"The <HI>Ostracism</HI> makes a great figure in all the <HI>Greek</HI> history, and occurs frequently in that of the <HI>Atheni∣ans,</HI>" among whom it is generally supposed to have had its rise.—This <HI>peculiar law</HI> was originally designed, as a guard to liberty; though sometimes abused, to the purposes of licentiousness and faction. "By this law men, eminent to such a degree, as to threaten the State with danger, were banished for ten years—The method in which they proceeded to inflict the <HI>Ostracism</HI> was this: Every citizen took a piece of broken pot or shell, on which having wrote the name of the person he would have banished, he carried it to a certain place of the <HI>forum,</HI> which was inclosed with rails; then the magistrates began to count the number of the shells a for if they were less than six thousand, the▪ vote did not take place; but if they surpassed that number, they laid every name apart, and the man whose name was found on the greatest number of shells was of course exiled for ten years."</P><P>This law speaks a people jealous of their liberty to an extreme.—For, however well intended; yet, through the craft of rivals in power, or the insidiousness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bitious and popular men, this punishment sometimes fell upon the worthiest characters in the state. <HI>Aris∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides,</HI> by the wisdom of his councils, the firmness of his courage and the inflexibility of his integrity, at home, abroad, in peace and war, had proved himself an <HI>illustrious patriot,</HI> acquired the sirname of <HI>the just</HI> and obtained the character of the most worthy and virtuous of the <HI>Athenians</HI>—But these very virtues and this high reputation, were artfully improved, by his rival <HI>Themistocles,</HI> as arguments against him, and to prove him a man <HI>dangerous</HI> to the state.

<P>CONSCIOUS integrity is a solid support.—A support, which the world can neither give nor take away.—Like <HI>Cato,</HI> the virtuous <HI>roman Senator,</HI> "to have done his duty,"—to have approved himself to that GOD, <HI>who sit∣teth on the throne of his holiness,</HI> is more to the good ruler, the <HI>true Patriot,</HI> than the approbation or applause of united worlds. With a serenity of mind, which no words
<PB N="27" REF="017114_0030_0FA02F74A5BE1C00"/>
can express, such a ruler most chearfully leaves it with heaven to estimate his fidelity and apportion the reward. His only request is that of pious <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> the faithful gover∣nour of <HI>Judea,</HI>—"Think upon me, O my GOD, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Neh. 5. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANOTHER thing necessary to the ends of civil government, and to render it a blessing to subjects and a <HI>Shield</HI> to the state, is the concurrence of the people, with their rulers, in their faithful endeavours and unremitting exertions, for internal peace and external de∣fence.</P>
<P>A sacred regard to the constitution, a cheer∣ful obedience to the laws and a reverend submission to the authority of those who are vested with the powers of government, are as much the duty of subjects, even in free states, as it is of rulers to be faithful to the trust reposed in them by the people. The obligations are mutually binding, equally indispensible, and equally necessary to the liber∣ty, safety, prosperity and happiness of society.</P>
<P>THE best constitution, the wisest laws, and the most faithful rulers are all in vain to a perverse, restless, factious, remiss or disobe∣dient people.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="017114_0031_0FA02F75422099F8"/>
IF a people violate the constitution, tram∣ple under foot the laws, cast contempt on authority and despise government; or fail, when lawfully required, to make those exer∣tions for defence, which the exigencies of the state may demand; they must thank them∣selves, and not their rulers, for that ruin which threatens and will most certainly overtake them. In the language of the prophet, it may justly be said to such a people,—"thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee."<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. 2. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE apostle <HI>Paul</HI> observes, "that the powers that be, are ordained of GOD": And justly considers civil government as <HI>an ordi∣nance of GOD.</HI> And that rulers are "the ministers of GOD", to a people, "for good."<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vid. Rom. 13. begin.</NOTE> From hence he concludes, that a people should acknowledge their authority and yield an obedient subjection:—And expressly says, <HI>that they must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ver. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE subjection here injoined is not abso∣lute, or that <HI>passive obedience</HI> and <HI>non-resist∣ance,</HI> so absurdly preached up, in the darker ages of the world: But that obedience and subjection to good and faithful rulers, which the social compact and the laws of the land require. And without this, government is at an end.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="017114_0032_0FA02F75F020B590"/>
IF rulers are not seconded and supported by the people, in the exercise of their autho∣rity, in the execution of the laws and the administration of government, their best at∣tempts, their most upright endeavours will never avail to the purposes intended by such an institution.</P>
<P>IT is with the people to add life to the constitution, energy to the laws, and dignity as well as strength to government: And that, both for internal peace, order and freedom, and external defence, against all who openly oppose, assault or invade the state.</P>
<P>IN a word, as by the social compact, the whole is engaged for the protection and de∣fence of the life, liberty and property of each individual; so each individual owes all that he hath, even life itself, to the support, pro∣tection and defence of the whole, when the exigencies of the state require it. And no man, whether in authority or subordination, can justly excuse himself from any duty, ser∣vice or exertions, in peace or war, that may be necessary for the publick peace, liberty, safety or defence, when lawfully and con∣stitutionally called thereto.</P>
<P>AS in the body natural, all the parts and members are necessary; and in their places severally concur to the health, strength and beauty of the whole: So in the body politick,
<PB N="30" REF="017114_0033_0FA02F76E3AC9568"/>
a well regulated state, a similar adjustment takes place.—And as all parts and members are necessary: So in their place and use, they all concur to the health, safety and happiness of society; and to the beauty, strength, glory and defence of the state.</P>

IT is of the highest importance to the well being of society; that every man, that all the members should know their place, and the duties of their station, in the Com∣monwealth, whether in authority, or subor∣dination: And every thing that tends to an alteration, or abridgment, of the powers of government, on the one hand, or of the rights of the people, on the other, should awaken the attention of both rulers and peo∣ple, and put all upon their guard.</P>
<P>FOR instance: The compromise of <HI>indivi∣duals,</HI> the plans of a <HI>junto,</HI> the schemes of a <HI>faction,</HI> or the intrigues of a <HI>court</HI> for the disposal of offices or the obtaining elections, have a threatning aspect on the liberties of the people, the powers of government and the constitution itself. <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> would never, perhaps, have had it in his power, to have totally subverted the <HI>republick</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> usurp'd the government and seated himself on the <HI>imperial throne,</HI> had not his way thereto been paved and prepared, by the private compact and <HI>artful compromise</HI> between <HI>Pom∣per</HI> the <HI>Great, Crassus</HI> and himself, which
<PB N="32" REF="017114_0035_0FA02F78ECC32310"/>
form'd the first <HI>triumvirate,</HI> that appeared in that <HI>great Commonwealth.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Pompey</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> were not yet at open enmity, nor professed rivals; but the <HI>former</HI> having taken various steps, which clearly indicated his ambitious views; the <HI>latter</HI> could not content himself with any thing short of the same supreme power to which his rival aspired. To accomplish the purpose of this ambition, <HI>Caesar</HI> considered the consulship as an essential step. In order to his ad∣vancement to the consulship, as well as to effect his ulti∣mate designs, <HI>Caesar</HI> found it necessary to avail himself of the influence not only of <HI>Crassus</HI> his rich and powerful friend, but also of <HI>Pompey</HI> his rival; and to serve himself of both: And this gave rise to the <HI>artful compromise</HI> we have mentioned. In this remarkable compact, <HI>Pompey</HI> and <HI>Crassus,</HI> as well as <HI>Caesar,</HI> had undoubtedly their views: But to adopt the words of celebrated historians, <Q><HI>Caesar's</HI> management, upon this occasion, was a <HI>master∣piece</HI> of policy, and the foundation of his future gran∣deur. The two citizens, who at this time made the greatest figure in the <HI>republic,</HI> without dispute, were <HI>Pompey</HI> and <HI>Crassus:</HI> but these two powerful citizens were declared enemies, and, all things considered, much upon a level. As they both had great interest, <HI>Caesar</HI> plainly saw, that he could never obtain the consulship without gaining one or other of them to his cause; but the difficulty was, which to choose. If he closed with <HI>Pompey,</HI> he would meet with a strong opposition from <HI>Crassus'</HI>s friends; and if he joined <HI>Crassus,</HI> he was sure to have all <HI>Pompey'</HI>s party against him. He therefore undertook to reconcile the two rivals and by proposing to them a triumvirate, in which should be lodged all the authority of the senate and people, he prevailed upon them to make up their differences, and enter into a strict friendship with each other. In order to make then confederacy the more indissoluble, they solemnly bound themselves, by mutual oaths and promises, to assist each other, and to suffer nothing to be underta∣ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or executed without the unanimous consent of all three.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus was the first triumvirate formed, by which <HI>Rome</HI> became a prey to <HI>three men,</HI> who, by the interest of their united parties, arbitrarily disposed of all the dignities and employments in the commonwealth. The public were long strangers to the mysteries of this new cabal. Nothing more appeared to the senate than the reconciliation of <HI>Pompey</HI> and <HI>Crassus;</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> was congratulated by all ranks of men for having brought it about, <HI>Cato</HI> alone foresaw the evil consequences of this new alliance, and exclaimed against it, saying. That <HI>Rome</HI> had lost her liberty: but nobody hearkened to him 'till it was too late to follow his prudent coun∣sel.

<P>IN all such cases, therefore, "<HI>Obsta Prin∣cipiis,</HI>" is a good maxim, and worthy the attention of all, And the first appearances
<PB N="33" REF="017114_0036_0FA02F7B930F7C70"/>
of such baneful machinations should be beheld with abhorrence and check'd with severity, by all orders of men in a <HI>free Commonwealth,</HI> as they are friends to their country and wish to preserve the liberties of the people, the pow∣ers of government, or the rights of the con∣stitution, inviolate to the State.</P>
<P>THIS precaution is always necessary.—It is more especially of importance when first en∣tering into society; or when a radical revo∣lution takes place, and a new form or consti∣tution of government is introduced.—Bad precedents are growing evils; and fatal con∣sequences commonly attend them, if not sea∣sonably checked and effectually crushed.</P>
<P>THE last thing which we shall mention, as necessary to the well being of society and the happiness of a free state, is the cordial con∣currence
<PB N="34" REF="017114_0037_0FA02F7CDCB82C40"/>
of all orders of men, in authority and subordination, in a sacred regard to religion; in a devout acknowledgment of their depen∣dance upon GOD, his providence and blessing, for all the benefits they expect to derive from a settled civil government.</P>
<P>THIS sentiment is evidently suggested in the words of our text.—<HI>The people,</HI> whose <HI>princes</HI> are here introduced as gathered together to consult for the common good, and transact the public affairs for the government and defence of the nation;—<HI>The people,</HI> whose rulers are here termed <HI>shields of the earth,</HI> and justly said to <HI>belong unto GOD;</HI> In a word, <HI>the peo∣ple,</HI> in whose settled government and flourish∣ing state, GOD, the supreme ruler, is said to be greatly exalted, are fitly stiled <HI>the people of the GOD of Abraham,</HI>—a people in covenant with GOD.—A people of his fear—of his praise.—A people deeply impressed with a sense of the Deity, his government and providence; and a people who cordially acknowledge their de∣pendance upon him and their indispensible ob∣ligations to fear and obey him, and to preserve and exercise a sacred regard to his worship, and to the doctrines and duties of that holy religion, which he had taught by his word.</P>
<P>THE importance of religion and morality, and a devout acknowledgment of the govern∣ment of heaven, to he support of order and government among men, and to the liberty,
<PB N="35" REF="017114_0038_0FA02F7E60F875D0"/>
safety and happiness of society, is what reason teaches, and what the common sense, as well as universal practice of mankind, in all ages and nations, concurs to confirm.</P>
<P>IN civilized nations, and where civil govern∣ment hath been established, many cities and pla∣ces of importance may be found without walls, without guards, and even without weapons or any preparations for common defence: But it is not easy to find any without, a <HI>temple,</HI> an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tar,</HI> a <HI>grove</HI> or some other place appoint∣ed and appropriated to the purposes of religion, the acknowledgment of heaven, and the wor∣ship of the Deity, in some shape or other.</P>
<P>IN all the free states of <HI>Greece</HI> and the great <HI>Republic of Rome,</HI> the regard that was paid to the worship of the gods and the rites of reli∣gion, was constant, punctual and expensive; and in many instances, especially on great oc∣casions, rose to the height of superstition. And no affair of importance to the liberty of the people, or the safety of the state, in peace or war, was undertaken, without a religious ac∣knowledgment of their dependance upon hea∣ven and the influence of the gods.</P>
<P>"THE great CAMILLUS who was twice saluted 'The Deliverer of his country,' to awaken in his fellow-citizens a sense of the importance of religion, appealed to the <HI>Romans</HI> whether they ever had better success than

when they carefully served GOD, or worse than when they neglected him."</P>
<P>"XENOPHON very justly observes, 'That <HI>Cyrus,</HI> one of the best and greatest kings of <HI>Persia,</HI> laid the foundation of that powerful empire, not so much by his valour, as by his religious acknowledgment of heaven, and his liberality in the worship and service of GOD."</P>
<P>BUT to instance from a yet higher autho∣rity: Doth not the holy prophet of the LORD both reprove and exhort the king of <HI>Judah,</HI> in terms which clearly express the high im∣portance of a sacred regard to the precepts of religion and morality, to the safety, happiness and flourishing state of a people, in that plain and faithful expostulation—<HI>Did not thy fa∣ther eat and drink, and do justice and judgment, and then it was well with him?

<P>WHEN the Supreme Ruler of the world gave notice to <HI>Moses,</HI> the great law-giver of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> nation, that the period of his ad∣ministration was hastening, and the time near at hand, when he must quit the high station he held at the head of the commonwealth of <HI>Israel,</HI> for a more exalted seat of immortal glo∣ry
<PB N="37" REF="017114_0040_0FA02F7FB130BA48"/>
in his kingdom above,—It is said, He call∣ed a solemn assembly of the people; and ha∣ving recapitulated the heads of the constitu∣tion GOD had given them, and rehearsed a summary of the statutes and precepts of the religion he had made known unto them, he closed his address, and took his leave of them, with this expressive and pathetic exhortation, saying, "Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day: For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: And through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whether ye go over <HI>Jor∣dan</HI> to possess it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. 33. 46 &amp; 47.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE truth is, religion, more especially as taught by the word of GOD, and enforced by the powerful arguments and engaging motives of the gospel of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is the source of liberty, the soul of government and the life of a people.—Its doctrines are sublime, its pre∣cepts excellent, its motives persuasive and en∣dearing, and its rewards rich, glorious and all divine,</P>
<P>RELIGION inspires the soul with the noblest sentiments, inflames the heart with the purest affections, and forms the man for every virtue,—for every service, which GOD or his coun∣try may either expect or require.</P>
<P>ITS benevolent precepts are all contained in <HI>love to GOD</HI> and <HI>love to man.</HI> And where
<PB N="38" REF="017114_0041_0FA02F806EB32F58"/>
this divine affection takes place, inspires the soul, warms the heart, influences the temper and governs the conduct; piety to GOD, and justice and charity to men, will mark, distin∣guish and dignify the character. And the same divine principle, penetrating the hearts of the various orders of men in society, and per∣vading the state, cannot fail producing the hap∣piest effects.—Vice and immorality, wicked∣ness and unrighteousness, in every form, in e∣very character, will soon disappear: And jus∣tice, temperance, truth and lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,—every vir∣tue, every grace which adorns human nature, or tends to the peace and happiness of society, will quickly take their place.</P>
<P>UNDER the sacred energy of so god-like a principle, rulers will become <HI>true patriots, real benefactors;</HI> the people willing and obedient subjects: And all orders of men will most cheerfully concur in every measure which wis∣dom can dictate for the common good.</P>
<P>IN a word, religion among a people, in its power, purity and governing influence, is the guardian of liberty, the strength of government, the energy of laws, the band of society, and both the glory and defence of the state.</P>
<P>IN times of prosperity, a people, that have made GOD their fear, and religion their care, may rest assured of the establishment and con∣tinuance of their flourishing state.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="017114_0042_0FA02F8131B4D2B0"/>
IN times of perplexity, when dangers sur∣round, oppressors threaten, or enemies invade, such a people have GOD for their refuge: And committing their cause unto him, in the way of well-doing, may humbly expect that light will arise in darkness, that the power of the oppressor shall be broken, that their enemies shall not prevail against them, and that GOD will maintain their right and their cause.</P>
<P>AT all times, under all circumstances, at home, abroad, in peace and war, such a people may safely &amp; cheerfully leave all their concerns in the hands of GOD; and in filial confidence of his presence, protection and blessing, may say with the Psalmist—"The LORD is on my side, I will not fear: What can man do unto me?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm 118. 6.</NOTE>—<HI>Happy is that people that is in such a case: Yea, happy is that people, whose GOD is the LORD.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">144. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the above representation, we have seen the fair side of the question: Government a blessing, and the <HI>shields of the earth,</HI> as they ought to be, employed for the good of man∣kind. But it may, notwithstanding, be justly said, that this is not always the case. And the question may still be asked—How, then, can it be asserted, "That the shields of the earth belong unto GOD?"</P>
<P>UPON this question it may be observed,—That it is admitted, that THE SHIELDS OF
<PB N="40" REF="017114_0043_0FA02F81F2DAE008"/>
THE EARTH may be reversed.—The powers of government may be abused. Rulers, how∣ever promising at first, may become oppres∣sors. Yea, this hath been too often the fact. But should this be the unhappy case; and, contrary to the just expectations of GOD and men, should <HI>the shields of the earth</HI> be rever∣sed, and turned against those whom they were intended to defend, it alters not the truth or propriety of the assertion. "The shields of the earth still belong unto GOD:" and "the LORD still sitteth on the throne of his holi∣ness."</P>
<P>SUCH is the nature of the divine govern∣ment, and such the wisdom of the Supreme Ruler, that good is brought out of evil. Even the oppressors of mankind are the servants of GOD; and their oppressions are so over-ruled as to be subservient to the designs of infinite wisdom and goodness, in the moral govern∣ment of the world.</P>
<P><HI>THE shields of the earth reversed,</HI> the pow∣ers of government abused, may be and are over-ruled in providence, so as to be produc∣tive of great good to society and mankind.</P>
<P>SUCH, indeed, is the <HI>inertia</HI> of mankind in general, that they are more prone to undue submission, than the contrary. Even a bad government is better than none, in the esti∣mation of the greater part of the world. And
<PB N="41" REF="017114_0044_0FA02F82B57AD778"/>
so great is the risque, the uncertainty and dan∣ger attending the attempt of a revolution, that it is not an easy matter to persuade a people, even under an undue exercise of power, to rise and resist. They will bear much, and long, before they can be brought to unite in such an attempt: but there are degrees of oppression beyond bearing; and which man∣kind, unless totally lost to all sentiments of liberty, and entirely broke to the yoke of sla∣very, will not submit to. And it is wise in GOD, and happy for a people, when the strides of oppression are permitted to be so great, and the violences of oppressors so hasti∣ly increased, as to rouse them effectually be∣fore it is too late.</P>
<P>OPPRESSORS are fitly called, "The rod of GOD's anger, and the staff in their hand is his indignation,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai 10. 5.</NOTE> They are wisely employ∣ed by the Supreme Ruler, to correct the er∣rors, reprove the vices, and reform the disor∣ders of societies, nations and states. They are more especially improved to rouse and restore the true spirit of liberty, when declining; and to bring on a total revolution, if necessary, to the preservation or restoration of so inesti∣mable a blessing.</P>
<P>INSTANCES of this are too numerous and too well known, to admit of dispute.</P>

As it was the afflicted state of GOD's peo∣ple <HI>Israel,</HI> that moved him, in mercy, to send <HI>Moses</HI> to deliver them: so it was the op∣pressions of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and the cruelty of the <HI>task-masters,</HI> that gave weight to his messages, and effectually roused them, in the face of eve∣ry danger, to assert their freedom, and attempt their deliverance from the <HI>Egyptian</HI> yoke.</P>
<P><HI>CHRISTENDOM</HI> would never have been roused, with firmness, to have attempted to free themselves from the <HI>hierachy</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> had not the oppressions of that power put them upon the expedient.</P>
<P>IT was a long series of injuries, and intole∣rable oppressions and cruelties, which taught the <HI>United States of Holland</HI> to assert their native freedom, independence and sovereign∣ty, against the power of <HI>Spain,</HI> then at the meridian of its strength and glory.</P>
<P><HI>BRITONS</HI> would never have so frequently resisted their kings, and flown to arms in de∣fence of their invaluable rights, had not the <HI>iron rod</HI> of oppression convinced them of the necessity of such strenuous exertions, to pre∣serve and protract the remains of liberty among them.</P>

<P>THIS day is great, as it is the first, appoin∣ted by the constitution, for the <HI>stated</HI> meet∣ing of the Princes of this people,—the fathers of the Commonwealth, in General Court: And it is also great, as it commences an AERA of <HI>Anniversaries,</HI> for the same joyful purpo∣ses,—to commemorate and partake of <HI>the blessings of</HI> LIBERTY and a FREE GO∣VERNMENT, which (we trust in GOD) will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but with time itself!!—</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="017114_0056_0FA02F903791EBF0"/>
ON this joyful day we are invited to see GOD, the supreme ruler, <HI>on the throne of his holiness,</HI> the saviour and defence of an afflicted land: "The princes of the people of the GOD of <HI>Abraham</HI> gathered together": And "The Shields of the earth," The rulers of every department, devoting themselves to the service of GOD and their country, in devout acknowledgment of his government, to the end, that GOD might <HI>be greatly exalted,</HI> in the good of his people, by their administration.</P>
<P>To add lustre to the joy of this day, we behold, <HI>a second time</HI> raised to the chief seat of government, in this Commonwealth, by the free suffrages of the people, <HI>a Gentleman,</HI> whose <HI>patriotic principles</HI> early engaged the attention of his fellow-citizens;—whose uni∣formity of conduct, in the several offices he sustained, effectually gained their esteem;—whose firm attachment to the liberties of his country, and determined resolution, at every risque and in the most trying times, to do all in his power to support them, established their confidence:—In a word, <HI>a Gentleman,</HI> whose disposition, ability and integrity, in the service of this and the <HI>United States,</HI> have been try∣ed and approved; and whose name is illustri∣ous, both as <HI>proscribed by Britain,</HI> and as <HI>authenticating that glorious act,</HI> by which <HI>the United States of America</HI> are forever separated from her, and declared to be <HI>a free and inde∣pendent NATION.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="017114_0057_0FA02F916C725390"/>
As this is the highest mark of esteem and confidence, in the power of an obliged peo∣ple to give; it cannot fail of being a support to His EXCELLENCY, under the weight and perplexing cares of government, and a pleasing inducement to those returns of at∣tention and fidelity, in the duties of his high station, which they may justly expect.</P>
<P>WE are also happy, this day, in beholding the next seat of government filled with a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> whose amiable disposition, excel∣lent qualifications, <HI>patriotic</HI> spirit, long experi∣ence and faithful services, in various depart∣ments, have endeared him to the people, and established a confidence in him, as worthy that exalted station, to which he is called by the general voice of the citizens of this free Commonwealth.</P>
<P>AND to compleat the gladness of our hearts upon this joyful occasion, we see the princes of the people, <HI>the honorable, the members of the Senate and House of Representatives,</HI> de∣legated by the suffrages of their brethren, from all parts of the state, <HI>gathered together</HI> and in General Court assembled, to consult the common good and transact the important affairs of government—And, as the <HI>first step</HI> of importance, we behold these <HI>princes of the people,</HI> these <HI>Shields of the earth,</HI> in solemn assembly, in GOD's holy sanctuary, met, reli∣giously to acknowledge their dependence upon
<PB N="55" REF="017114_0058_0FA02F92A3E427F8"/>
GOD, the supreme ruler, and devoutly to implore his presence, direction and blessing.—O may that <HI>GOD, who sitteth on the throne of his holiness,</HI> who is the fountain of wisdom and <HI>Father of lights;</HI>—even that GOD, whose ear is ever open to the sincere prayers of his people, send them his blessing and an answer of peace!</P>
<P>MAY the most high GOD take these SHIELDS of the earth, this day, under his immediate care and patronage, guidance and direction. May the spirit of GOD and of glory descend and rest upon his EXCELLEN∣CY, his HONOUR, the <HI>honorable, the Coun∣cil,</HI> to be chosen, <HI>the Senate</HI> and <HI>the House of Representatives:</HI> And may the divine presence and blessing attend them this day, and in all their councils, debates and govern∣mental acts, through the whole course of the year. Thus may it appear to all this people, that the LORD hath directed their choice; and that these <HI>Shields of the earth,</HI> these rulers of the people, do, indeed, <HI>belong unto GOD,</HI> are devoted to his service and instruments of his glory.</P>
<P>THAT plainness of speech which hath been adopted in the whole of this discourse, may well superceed the necessity of any particular application, by way of address.—The whole is intended as <HI>an humble address</HI> to <HI>the fathers of this Commonwealth,</HI> and to this respectable
<PB N="56" REF="017114_0059_0FA02F932F99D638"/>
assembly.—If any thing hath been suggested worthy attention, or adapted to the occasion, we trust in the candor of the assembly for a cordial reception. Whatever is of a different complexion, is not likely to be made better, by any thing further added, to render it more acceptable.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>political fathers,</HI> however, will permit me, with all deference, to observe,—</P>
<P>'THAT the elections of this day; and which, agreeable to the <HI>social compact,</HI> are to take place, as the first business of the <HI>General Court,</HI> (however limited) are justly consider∣ed, as interesting and important.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider the importance of the <HI>executive department,</HI> to a due administration of government;—The high rank of Coun∣sellors;—How much the power of the Chief Magistrate is limited by their advice, in the disposal of places, the appointment of officers, and other things interesting to the communi∣ty—or the important influence they have in the administration of government, and the management of the great affairs of the Com∣monwealth;—it should influence to the wisest use of that power of election, with which the honorable <HI>Senotors</HI> and <HI>Representatives,</HI> by Constitution are vested.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="017114_0060_0FA02F96CC0C9458"/>
IS the election limited?—Still there is a choice,—A choice, which made with wisdom and fidelity, may be of great utility to this Commonwealth.</P>
<P>IT is no impeachment of the abilities, ho∣nor or integrity of any man, to suppose, that, in a body of wise, great and good men, there may be different talents and improvements, and distinct characters, that may have an o∣pening for exercise, and shine with a peculiar lustre, in different departments of civil go∣vernment.</P>
<P>WHAT these talents and characters are, how to be distinguished, in whom to be found and where to be placed, for the purposes of government, and best good of the Common∣wealth, is not for me to determine. But certain it is, these are questions of no small importance to the public good: And questions, to which our <HI>honored civil fathers</HI> will give that attention, which their interest∣ing nature demands.</P>
<P>NOT only to preserve, as distinct as possi∣ble, the several departments of government, that so they might be a mutual check upon each other; but also to give dignity to go∣vernment and energy to the laws, as well as ease to administration, were evidently in view, by adopting this branch in the constitution: And it cannot be doubted, that, not only those
<PB N="58" REF="017114_0061_0FA02F985A852B58"/>
who assisted in adjusting the constitution, but also the people at large promised themselves much from this <HI>high department.</HI></P>
<P>THE election of counsellors, therefore, however limited, will always be justly consi∣dered as <HI>a sacred deposit</HI> in the hands of the General Assembly, of the highest importance to the liberty and safety, the peace and pros∣perity of this Commonwealth. And, with all deference, it may be said by the people, up∣on such an occasion, "We claim it as our right, That, among those who are returned for Counsellors and Senators, the persons best qualified to serve GOD and their country in that exalted department, be elected to <HI>the council board.</HI>" And may GOD send a perfect lot!—</P>
<P>THE foundations which have been so hap∣pily laid in our <HI>new constitution,</HI> are to be established: and, we trust, in the hands of wise and faithful rulers, and by a good administra∣tion they will be established for "The FOUNDATIONS OF MANY GENE∣RATIONS."</P>
<P>MUCH depends upon the steps that have been and are still to be taken, under this con∣stitution: and to derive the benefits and bles∣sings we promise ourselves and posterity from it, the greatest care should be taken, not only to preserve the constitution itself, in all its
<PB N="59" REF="017114_0062_0FA02F9866876358"/>
parts, sacred and inviolate; but also, as much as possible to have the genuine spirit and prin∣ciples of it inspiring the laws, and directing the exercise of the powers of government.</P>
<P>WE have seen, in the pr%ceeding discourse, a specimen of the importance of attention and fidelity in rulers, and something of the nature of the engaging and powerful motives hereun∣to: As also the glorious rewards which those are intitled to who are faithful and persevering in the discharge of the duties of their several offices and stations. And surely there never was a time when the calls of GOD, of provi∣videnc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and our country, to the practice of these virtues, were greater than the present.</P>
<P>MANY things, interesting in their nature, and important in their consequences, demand the attention of our <HI>civil fathers,</HI> in the seve∣ral departments of government; but especially in the <HI>General Court.</HI>—Inattention and remiss∣ness are at all times inexcuseable, in those who have accepted seats in government or places of trust and authority; And I need not observe, that at such a day as this, they must be <HI>cri∣minal</HI> indeed! The laws, distributive justice, the order and peace of society, the internal po∣licy and government of the Commonwealth and the trade and commerce of the land, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> subjects which statedly call for the care and attention of rulers and government.—The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wretched state of our <HI>medium,</HI> by which trade
<PB N="60" REF="017114_0063_0FA02F9927CB3D98"/>
is obstructed, the poor oppressed, the course of justice, in matters of property, retarded; the community defrauded, the public faith and public credit perplexed, is truly affecting, and demands immediate consideration; and if any thing within the limits of human wisdom and penetration can yet further be thought of, to remedy so great an evil, it is fervently ho∣ped, it will not escape the notice of the General Court.</P>
<P>THE declining state of religion, morality and virtue; and the great prevalence of vice and immorality, irreligion and profaneness, in almost every form, and in the various orders and ages of men; it is humbly conceived, are subjects, not only important in themselves, but of the highest consequence to the well∣being of society, and call aloud for the inter∣position of rulers, who are ordained of GOD to be <HI>a terror to evil doers</HI> and to <HI>evil works.</HI> In vain do the teachers of religion and even the <HI>ambassadors of Christ</HI> preach and teach the importance of religion, the excellence of virtue, and the necessity of morality, justice, tempe∣rance, truth or righteousness; while vice, in its various forms, is winked at by authority, and iniquity established by law.</P>
<P>I WOULD not be understood, as supposing this to be our case; but rather to express an earnest desire to prevent it, by those timely exertions which wisdom and policy, as well
<PB N="61" REF="017114_0064_0FA02F99F06FFA88"/>
as piety and godliness, teach us to make, for the glory of GOD and good of society.—And certain it is, that much depends upon those in authority, and much is expected, and much may be done by our <HI>civil fathers,</HI> by <HI>well-judged</HI> and <HI>well-executed laws,</HI> for the sup∣pressing and punishing of vice and immora∣lity, and the encouragement and support of religion and virtue.</P>
<P>BUT after all, it is by example, <HI>a living ex∣ample,</HI> of justice and righteousness, temperance and chastity, faithfulness and integrity; and that glorious assemblage of christian graces and moral virtues, by which human nature is adorned, and society rendered happy, that ru∣lers give energy to laws, effectually suppress vice in its various forms, encourage virtue, and introduce and promote a thorough reformation among a people.—Virtue in high stations shines with an increased lustre, hath an exten∣sive influence, and sweetly atracts the atten∣tion and engages the imitation of all around.—But without this, reproofs are in vain, punish∣ments ineffectual, and laws to little or no pur∣pose.</P>
<P>IN a word, a want of attention to religion and virtue, in rulers or people, may blast our wisest counsels, sap the foundations of our most raised expectations and bring confusion on all our measures.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="017114_0065_0FA02F9AA91CA0B0"/>
WITH grateful souls and thankfulness to heaven, we revere and admire the wisdom, the piety and policy of our <HI>fore-fathers,</HI> in the early and effectual care they took, even while weak-handed and yet in an infant state, for the good education of children and youth.—Laws, for the support of <HI>grammar schools,</HI> in the several towns, were made, established and <HI>sacredly</HI> regarded. <HI>Colleges</HI> were founded and endowed, and cheerfully and generously sup∣ported.—These institutions have been, for se∣veral generations, the sources of light, of knowledge, of literature, of liberty and reli∣gion; and under GOD, the happy means of forming many worthy characters, for eminent usefulness, both in church and state. And to these institutions, we are not a little indebted for that knowledge to discern, that wisdom to state, and that spirit to defend our rights and liberties, civil and religious, for which the in∣habitants of these States have been so justly ce∣lebrated, in the present contest; and which have introduced and established that <HI>glorious revolution</HI> which hath taken place in <HI>America.</HI> May the present generation be impressed and inspired with the same excellent spirit; and may it be encouraged and prevail, in those that succeed, to the end of time!</P>
<P>THE <HI>University</HI> at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the <HI>American academy</HI> of arts and sciences, and all other in∣stitutions for the promoting of <HI>literature,</HI> are most fervently commended to the care and patronage of the <HI>civil fathers</HI> of this Com∣monwealth.</P>

BUT it is not so much in the high attain∣ments in science, to which <HI>the learned few</HI> may arrive, as in the diffusing <HI>common</HI> and <HI>use∣ful knowledge</HI> in all orders of men, that the li∣berty and safety of a <HI>free</HI> Commonwealth con∣sists. The <HI>former</HI> may flourish, and in fact have been encouraged, and carried to an emi∣nent heighth of glory, in despotic states, while the latter hath been depressed; and even at the same time, that it hath been the ungene∣rous policy of persons in power, to frown up∣on, and artfully to discourage the means of common education, and to keep the multitude in the lowest state of ignorance, that thus they might be <HI>fit tools</HI> to carry to effect the purposes of oppression and arbitrary power; and be continued in a state of <HI>slavery,</HI> without ever knowing, either the loss of their <HI>liberty,</HI> or <HI>their rights as men.</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been said, 'The law is the inheri∣tance of the people.'—I wish to GOD, that multitudes of the people of this Common∣wealth, had no reason to complain, that they have been abridged of a <HI>precious</HI> part of this in∣heritance, in that too general neglect and con∣tempt, with which <HI>the law,</HI> for keeping <HI>gram∣mar</HI> SCHOOLS in the several towns, hath been treated for a number of years past.—In the name of GOD, our country and posterity, it may be pertinently asked—What becomes of the <HI>children</HI> of the <HI>poor,</HI>—the <HI>widow,</HI> and <HI>them that have no helper,</HI> when so useful, so

And thus many a good scholar and worthy character, hath been introduced to public usefulness, is church or state, which, but for this law, must have been lost to the public, and remained in obscurity.</P></NOTE></P>

THAT GOD, who <HI>fitteth upon the throne of his holiness,</HI> in the rise, progress, and even unto the present state of the great contest, in which we are engaged, hath gloriously ap∣peared for our help and support, in number∣less instances.

<Q><P>The taking of <HI>Praeneste</HI> and <HI>Norba</HI> put an end to the civil war in <HI>Italy.

They shall all perish to a man.</HI> These words, from a man who was absolute master of their lives &amp; fortunes, made the most resolute tremble. They filled the whole city with dread and horror; and the consternation was doubled the next day, when they saw fixed up in all public places, a list of proscribed persons, containing the names of <HI>forty senators</HI> and <HI>six∣teen hundred knights.</HI> If any man gave shelter to a person proscribed, though his son, his brother, or his father, death was the certain reward of his humanity; whereas the assassin was recompenced with two talents, though a slave had murdered his master, or a son his father.—The <HI>tyrent</HI> chose such agents to execute his decrees, as had even less pity than himself. The chief of those was the infamous <HI>Cataline.</HI>—At the head of a band of assassins, he scoured the streets, and killed many knights and senators before they knew they were proscribed. The persons named in the list were sought for in their own houses, in the porticoes, and even in the temples; whence they were dragged to <HI>Sylla,</HI> and cruelly butchered in his presence.</P>
<P>The massacre was not confined to those named in the list. <HI>Sylla</HI> extended his revenge to all who had borne arms against him, of what rank soever, or condi∣tion. Nay, his cruel agents took this opportunity to gratify their private revenge and avarice, confounding the most innocent and peaceable with the most guilty, out of some private grudge, or purely for the sake of their wealth and rich furniture. In short, the slaugh∣ter was so dreadful, that <HI>Sylla</HI> was reproached with it even by his best friends. Among others, a young sena∣tor, named <HI>Caius Metellus,</HI> ventured one day to ask him in full senate, when he designed to put a stop to the calamities of his fellow citizens. <HI>We do not inter∣cede</HI> said he, <HI>for such as you have resolved to destroy: but only desire you to free those from uneasiness, whom you have determined to save. Sylla,</HI> without seeming to take this bold speech amiss, answered cooly, that he knew not yet whom he should save. <HI>Name to us then,</HI> replied <HI>Metellus, those you are determined to destroy, That I will do,</HI> answered <HI>Sylla,</HI> very smartly, and im∣mediately caused a new list to be fixed up of <HI>eighty ci∣tizens,</HI> whom he proscribed, most of them senators, and persons of great distinction. The next day he proscri∣bed <HI>two hundred and twenty</HI> more, and an equal num∣ber the third. Among these was <HI>Marcus Marius,</HI> who was nearly related to the great <HI>Marius,</HI> and highly fa∣voured by the people.—He was seized by <HI>Cataline,</HI> and put to death, after having suffered the most exquisite torments tyranny could invent. He was whipped thro' all the streets of <HI>Rome,</HI> and, after this ignominious pu∣nishment, carried beyond the <HI>Tyber,</HI> where by <HI>Sylla's</HI> barbarous agents, his eyes were put out, his hands and ears cut off, his tongue torn out, all his joints dislocated, and his bones broken. One <HI>Marcus Plaetorius,</HI> being moved at such an affecting sight, could not help pitying the unfortunate young man; which so offended <HI>Sylla,</HI> that he ordered him to be killed on the spot And now after <HI>nine thousand</HI> senators, knights, and citizens had been inhumanly murdered by <HI>Sylla's</HI> agents, he assem∣bled the people, and told them, that he had proscribed as many as he could think of at present: and as for those he had forgot, they should be proscribed too, as soon as he could call them to his memory!</P></Q>
<P>This was the scene in the city of <HI>Rome</HI>—What awful havock, then, must the same measures of cruelty have made in the other cities and states of that great Common∣wealth!—But no comment is necessary.</P>

WHEN, <HI>mad with loyalty,</HI> the <HI>British</HI> nation restored their <HI>flattering tyrant, Charles</HI> IId. a scene of blood was opened, more affecting, perhaps, to the more judicious part of the peo∣ple, than all that had appeared in the civil war.

Notwithstanding the <HI>exile-king</HI> promised eve∣ry thing to regain the throne; and upon his return and restoration, made public proclama∣tion of an act of <HI>amnesty</HI> or general pardon; not only the <HI>king's judges,</HI> so called, but many

of the worthiest characters were soon <HI>attaint∣ed</HI> and <HI>proscribed:</HI> And it was quickly found, that nothing short of the <HI>best blood</HI> of the na∣tion, would be a sacrifice sufficient to appease his own resentment, or his <HI>father's ghost.</HI></P>
<P>THE same, or perhaps, more affecting scenes will probably be opened in <HI>America,</HI> should we fail of success in the present contest; or should these <HI>United States</HI> be ever subdued by <HI>arms,</HI> or cajoled by <HI>arts,</HI> to a return and submission to <HI>Britain.</HI>—But this is an event, which (we firmly trust) will never take place.</P>
<P>UPON the whole: in our united counsels and exertions, we may yet hope, and even assure ourselves, that GOD who <HI>who sitteth upon the throne of his holiness,</HI> will behold our state, hear our prayers, and still <HI>maintain our right</HI> and <HI>plead our cause.</HI>—That he will has∣ten the period of our present distresses, and give us to see, in his own way and time, the liberty, independence, sovereignty and glory of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, established on a foundation that shall never be moved.</P>
<P>AND what a bright, what a glorious scene of liberty and felicity doth such an happy is∣sue of this <HI>great</HI> and <HI>interesting contest,</HI> pre∣sent to our view?—<HI>America,</HI> redeemed out of the hands of her enemies—<HI>the United
<PB N="74" REF="017114_0077_0FA02FA7739926F8"/>
States,</HI> delivered from the oppressors yoke; the secure retreat of injured innocence and the happy <HI>asylum</HI> of the oppressed and distressed.—The seat of justice and equity, of freedom and empire—extensive in trade and flourishing in commerce—abounding in riches and wealth—and illustrious in literature—in arts and sci∣ences;—and, above all, glorious in the know∣ledge and practice of the pure and peaceful religion of our LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST:—And the <HI>unborn millions</HI> of succeeding ages, uniting in their grateful acknowledgments of praise and thanksgiving to GOD the supreme ruler, for that spirit of wisdom, liberty, patriotism and bravery, with which he was pleased to inspire the <HI>patriots</HI> and <HI>heroes;</HI> and even <HI>the whole body of the people</HI> of the present generation:—and, in fine—THIS PEOPLE, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, <HI>a name, a praise</HI> and <HI>a glory</HI> among the nations, throughout all generations, to the end of time.</P>
<P>THAT such may be the end, such the reward, and such the important and lasting effects, of this <HI>great</HI> and <HI>glorious contest,</HI> may GOD, of his infinite mercy, grant, through Jesus Christ, our LORD</P>
