<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FRAGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TIRED with oppression in our native land, and in hopes of a better situation in America, two hundred of us, hale, hearty, and industrious, besides women and children, embarked at Londonderry, on board the ******, bound for Philadelphia.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="030158_0004_0FE3FA9EAE627B30"/>
From the outset untoward acci∣dents awaited us. We had not been ten days at sea, when our vessel sprung a leak, which, for a long time, baffled all our endeavours. At length, being discovered, it was stopped, and we esteemed ourselves secure.—Thougtless mortals! the disappoint∣ment of to-day never produces the effect of preparing us for the cala∣mity of to-morrow!</P>
<P>A gust arose! the elements warred together, as if it were the "last groan of expiring nature." The floodgates of heaven seemed loosed! dreadful peals of thunder rattled on the ear. The stoutest hearts were appalled. The forked lightning
<PB N="7" REF="030158_0005_0FE3FAA43740DA08"/>
struck our mast, and set the vessel on fire. Beset by two raging elements—the roaring billows, which lashed her sides, and seemed ready to swallow her and us, though they had appeared so terrific before—now lost their hor∣rors, and were regarded—melancholy alternative!—as a less tremendous enemy than their new auxiliary.</P>
<P>With vast difficulty, the flame was extinguished—but not until it had rendered our vessel scarcely manage∣able. To complete the measure of our woes, our provisions fell short. A biscuit and a pint of water, fetid and almost as dense as glue, was the daily portion of each! Every morning saw two or three miserable wretches
<PB N="8" REF="030158_0006_0FE3FAA6FB1048F8"/>
heaved overboard, into a watry grave, in the presence of their dejected friends and relatives, each hourly ex∣pecting the hand of death to close his eyes, and free him from his abyss of misery.</P>
<P>"Father! father!" cries a once beautiful, but now emaciated child, whose visage bore irresistible evidence of near-approaching mortality, <Q>get me a drink! I faint—I die!—for God's sake let me have a drop of water to quench my thirst!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Captain, I beg a little water to save my child from death,</Q>—<Q>You have had your share for to-day, and shall have no more.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="030158_0007_0FE3FAACD5222800"/>
<Q>Brute! stranger to the tender feel∣ings of nature—had you a child—but you are not worthy of having one—you would pity my present situation, and relieve me.</Q></P>
<P>The mother of the child, who had swooned away, just came to herself. She heard his plaintive cries. She joined her voice to his, and besought the father to procure the water.</P>
<P>Melancholy, anguish, and torture, seized the tender husband's—the ten∣der father's soul. The big tear rolled down his cheek. <Q>Gracious and all∣powerful God! why visit your children with such calamities? Pre∣sumptuous man!</Q> added he, reco∣vering himself, <Q>are you to dare scru∣tinize
<PB N="10" REF="030158_0008_0FE3FAAFF302DE50"/>
the ways of unerring Providence? Not my will, O Lord, but thine be done!</Q></P>
<P>He returned to the scene he had just quitted. His beloved child lay breathing his last. His wife had swooned away again. The sight was too afflictive. His agonies over∣powered him. He went to the captain, whom he quarrelled with, struck. The blows were returned. He seized a sword; and the captain, rushing for∣ward, received it in his breast. He closed his eyes for ever.</P>
<P>Disorder and confusion ensued in the vessel. The sailors plundered every thing they could lay their hands upon: and such was their irregularity
<PB N="11" REF="030158_0009_0FE3FAB57AAC08E8"/>
and carelessness, that they ran the ves∣sel aground at Synapuxent, in the state of Maryland.</P>
<P>The sea ran mountains high. A skiff, with about twenty persons on board, was overset by an enormous wave. The shrieks and piteous cries of men, women, and children, soon died away. They were swallowed up in one common grave. Most of the remainder were drowned in endea∣vouring to swim to land.</P>
<P>About thirty miserable wretches of us, gained the shore, some fortunate enough to save their property. We expected there to meet with relief and comfort. Fatal delusion! Had we been thrown ashore among the New
<PB N="12" REF="030158_0010_0FE3FAB8933FCF88"/>
Zealanders, among the swarthy sons of Guinea, or among the rapacious Alge∣rines, our fate could not have been more severe. We were cruelly plun∣dered. Not a valuable article was left us—and we were reduced to beggary in a strange land, without a hope of redress.</P>
<P>Man! man! wretched, infatuated man! Can a sordid trifle tempt you thus to violate every rule of right and justice—to steel your heart against the feelings of humanity—and to be more cruel and noxious than the raging ele∣ments! Short is your day—and then all the vanities of this world will pass away—the veil that prevents your regarding objects in their true light,
<PB N="13" REF="030158_0011_0FE3F98AE2079BE0"/>
will be removed—keen remorse will prey upon your tortured soul, and be an earnest of your future never-dying woe!</P>
<P>Rulers of America! Guard against this barbarity! make severe laws to punish the miscreants who may be guilty of it—and let a civic crown be awarded the man who ventures his own life to save that of a fellow-crea∣ture in the direst distress!</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>'To catch the living manners as they rise.'</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EVERY writer, who has follow∣ed the career of the great Addison, has begun his numbers with a descrip∣tion of himself, his views, situation, &amp;c. in order, at the commencement of the journey, to ingratiate himself into the favour of his fellow travellers.
<PB N="15" REF="030158_0013_0FE3FAC7B89F6838"/>
From this custom it would be consi∣dered equally improper to depart, as for a clergyman to begin a sermon without taking a text. To shew my respect, therefore, for the reader of my lucubrations, I shall give a pro∣logue to the entertainment I am about to provide for him.</P>
<P>I am of a very ancient family, and have the honour to have some of the <HI>inca</HI> blood in my veins—being des∣cended from the unfrotunate Atabali∣ba, who so miserably perished through the avarice and ignorance of Pizarro. By the female line I boast of an ances∣tor, the great Owen Roe O'Nial, the asserter of Irish liberty. My great grandfather, by the mother's side,
<PB N="16" REF="030158_0014_0FE3FACACF5A8EA8"/>
came over to this country with the divine Penn, whose humane and tole∣rant spirit laid the foundation of so much happiness for the people of his province.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the grandeur of my parentage, I drew my first breath in a small cottage at the foot of the Alle∣ghany mountain. There, free as air, I imbibed from my early age all the ardour and patriotism of spirit usually generated by independence: for it is but too true, that
<Q><L><HI>Haud facile emergunt, quorum vir tutibus obstat</HI></L>
<L><HI>Res angusta domi.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030158_0015_0FE3FAD067FE24D8"/>
With a few books, but those judici∣ously chosen by a watchful parent, I acquired a sense of the "Dignity of "human nature." I saw, with reli∣gious gratitude and reverence, the vast and unparalleled advantages of our western hemisphere. I learned to despise the sopperies, the follies, and the pretended refinements of the old world. I enjoyed, with rapture, the boundless prospects of happiness and virtue, destined, as I hoped, for re∣mote posterity, in these extensive regions.</P>
<P>From Alleghany's foot I removed to the metropolis of America, as Phi∣ladelphia proudly vaunts herself. I here observed manners prevailing,
<PB N="18" REF="030158_0016_0FE3FAD3C673F270"/>
which, when I had read of them, as European, I had despised. I saw a few, whose example must have a pow∣erful influence, giving a taint to the general mass, and appearing anxious in endeavouring to accelerate the arrival of that degeneracy, which the patriot endeavours to delay as far as possible. These <HI>observations,</HI> it may be reasona∣bly presumed, gave me pain. I dread∣ed that the asylum, so much boasted of, would be destroyed—and that from a spreading depravity, the state of America, the revolution of which <Q>had revived the hopes of good men, and promised an opening to better times, would become a discourage∣ment to future efforts in favour of
<PB N="19" REF="030158_0017_0FE3FAD976216048"/>
liberty, and prove only an opening to a new scene of human degeneracy and misery.</Q></P>
<P>And is there, thought I, no person to step forward, and endeavour to stem the torrent that is gradually sapping the foundation of morals and manners, and which, if suffered to proceed un∣interruptedly, will bear down every things valuable in its progress?</P>
<P>As I have ever conceived, that even the attempt to accomplish great objects is laudable, I chose rather to expose my own weakness, than be wanting to the public interest. I de∣termined to communicate to my fel∣low citizens the <HI>observations</HI> I might occasionally make, in hopes of being
<PB N="20" REF="030158_0018_0FE3FADC38001710"/>
serviceable to the cause of virtue, Happy, too happy shall I be, if I be∣come the humble instrument of sham∣ing out of countenance any single one of the follies or vices, which are so carefully transplanted from their native soil, and which, like other ill weeds, flourish apace, and threaten to choke up the valuable plants.</P>
<P>Conscious of my inability, unassist∣ed, to accomplish, to the extent I de∣sire, the grand object I have in view, I have enlisted into the service a few aids de camp who will occasionally furnish their speculations. Hence will arise an agreeable diversity of stile and sentiment—and that sameness, so lia∣ble
<PB N="21" REF="030158_0019_0FE3FAE21C18CB78"/>
to disgust the reader, be provent∣ed.</P>
<P>I invite every man, who is desirous to advance the best interests of society, to co-operate in this undertaking.—Personality and scurrility I despise, and shall avoid. But general satire however severe, if calculated to an∣swer good purposes, shall be always acceptable.</P>
<P>So many times have periodical essayists assumed the pen, and so great is the sameness of their subjects of discussion, that most of them are nearly exhausted:—and therefore much no∣velty is hardly to be expected. Ter∣ence

<HEAD>SECOND NUMBER. MODERN IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>When flatter'd crimes of a licentious age Reproach our silence, and demand our rage; When purchas'd follies from each distant land,</L>
<L>Improve so fast in young Columbia's hand—To chafe our spleen, when themes like these increase,</L>
<L>Shall panegyric reign, and satire cease?</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>liberality</HI> of manners and customs, daily introducing into our country, must afford the highest grati∣fication to every lover of elegance and <HI>refinement.</HI> We are as repidly as hap∣pily dissipating the <HI>rust</HI> and <HI>prejudices</HI> of past times, and, with a spirit of emulation beyond our years, copying
<PB N="24" REF="030158_0022_0FE3FAF389DCF2B8"/>
the <HI>graces</HI> and <HI>virtues</HI> of England, France, and Italy. To particularize every instance, in which we excel our ancestors, would require more time and room than I can now devote to the purpose—indeed, it would be be∣yond my abilities, to do justice to so capacious a subject. I shall, there∣fore, for the present, confine myself to one leading feature in modern man∣ners, wherein their superiority to those of old times is too obvious not to com∣mand the assent of the most superficial observer.</P>
<P>The feature I mean, is the relaxa∣tion of the <HI>odious restraints</HI> so ex∣tremely disagreeable in the married state. Heretosore, when a man or
<PB N="25" REF="030158_0023_0FE3FAED97875C78"/>
woman made choice of a partner for life, that partner was considered as entitled to the chief of his or her cares and attentions. Any breach of this rule was <HI>ridiculously</HI> regarded as a violation of the laws of decorum and propriety, which entailed discredit on the offending party. The husband gallanted his wife, to the theatre, to balls, to assemblies, to concerts, and to private parties. The <HI>insipid mono∣tony</HI> of such a life must be to the last degree irksome and disgusting; as one of the highest gratifications of human nature is variety.</P>
<P>Behold! what a charming contrast is exhibited at present! In the fashiona∣ble world—(and must we not expect,
<PB N="26" REF="030158_0024_0FE3FAF65A13FAC8"/>
that this refinement will, in due sea∣son, like every other, descend to the lower classes?)—a man is proscribed from attendiing on his wife, or appear∣ing in public with her. He may gra∣tify his passion for variety by taking a new lady under his protection every day of his life. How ineffably agreea∣ble, how delightful a change!</P>
<P>This will introduce, among its other advantages, an unusual degree of <HI>harmony</HI> in the married state. The chief cause, if we believe the writer of that <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>edisying</HI> comedy, the <HI>school for scandal,</HI> why ladies are so <HI>refractory</HI> and unmanageable with their husbands, is the consciousness of possessing—what? why that <HI>ridicu∣lous
<PB N="27" REF="030158_0025_0FE3FAFBEF4355B0"/>
old fashioned</HI> quality, called chas∣tity—a quality, which, however suita∣ble to the days of <HI>ignorance</HI> and <HI>bar∣barism,</HI> on the first settlement of this country, ought to be <HI>entirely laughed out of countenance</HI> at present. Every thing, therefore, that has a tendency to extirpate this troublesome quality, must be productive of peace and har∣mony. And I believe no man in his senses will deny, that the improve∣ment in question will have the happi∣est tendency that could be wished, to banish chastity and all her <HI>troublesome retinue</HI> from our shores. Perhaps, they may fly for refuge among the Creek Indians, to the court of the puissant prince, Alexander M'Gil∣livray.
<PB N="28" REF="030158_0026_0FE3FAFF06F1B1D8"/>
Such antiquated beings are fit only for the uncultivated savages—they ought not to disgrace such an advanced state of civilization as we can boast.</P>
<P>"When a lady," says Mr. Sheri∣dan, the author of that <HI>valuable come∣dy</HI> I have already mentioned, "com∣mits a TRIFLING <HI>faux pas,</HI> she grows cautious, and ready to <HI>humour</HI> and <HI>agree</HI> with her husband.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">School for Scandal—page 40, American edition.</NOTE>This <HI>excel∣lent</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> maxim, which I hope no person will controvert, estab∣lishes beyond a doubt my position, that this new mode will be productive of matrimonial concord.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="030158_0027_0FE3FB04CDBE0D18"/>
Another of the benefits of this ex∣pansion of the human mind, is the catholicism it will introduce with res∣pect to <HI>children.</HI> As a husband will not in future have the same degree of certainty, that his wife's children be∣long <HI>properly speaking,</HI> to himself, he will be no longer so <HI>contemptibly</HI> and <HI>illiberally</HI> contracted in his regards and cares of them, as parents used to be, in times of <HI>prejudice.</HI> Moreover, it is to be hoped and expected, that he will confer the <HI>same favours</HI> on his neighbours, as they on him. Hence, a <HI>community of children</HI> will be intro∣duced among us, in a much more agreeable way, than that attempted in one of the old republics. How
<PB N="30" REF="030158_0028_0FE3FB082201B040"/>
charming, then, will it be, that a man may point out <HI>likenesses of himself</HI> in the houses of almost all his ac∣quaintance! The political good ten∣dency of this is equal to its beneficial moral effects.</P>
<P>Among the French, that nation of gallantry and refinement, the <HI>stiff starched</HI> manners that have hitherto prevailed in this country, have been long exploded. A lady's bed-charm∣ber, which here has been too gene∣rally considered as her <HI>sanctum sancto∣rum,</HI> impervious to every one but the <HI>privileged husband,</HI> there yields to the superior influence of fashion and gal∣lantry. A gentleman has <HI>free access</HI> to it in the morning, before the lady
<PB N="31" REF="030158_0029_0FE3FB0DABAD8C90"/>
rises, and chooses it as the most pro∣per place for making enquiries after her health. As the ladies universally paint there, perhaps this fashion was introduced in order to give the gentle∣men an opportunity of <HI>seeing,</HI> before the application of the colours, what could not be seen afterwards—that is, the ladies' faces in their natural state. A lady, without the smallest embar∣rassment,
<Q><L>" when from her sheets her lovely form she lifts,</L>
<L>" She begs, you just would turn you, while she shifts."</L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Young's love of same.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>This <HI>elegant, unconstrained</HI> trait of
<PB N="32" REF="030158_0030_0FE3FB10E1377E88"/>
manners, will, it is hoped, be adop∣ted by our great people, who have so long and so happily distinguished themselves in the <HI>honourable, independ∣ent,</HI> and <HI>patriotic</HI> art of imitating the modes and manners of Europe,—which are so <HI>wonderfully calculated</HI> for this hemisphere.</P>
<P>The next step we have to take—and which will naturally follow—is the introduction of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ces<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eism</HI> from the Italians. I have been much surprised that the French, who have always paid such particular attention to the refinement of morals and manners, have never borrowed this <HI>admirable</HI> custom from their transalpine neigh∣bours. This is the more singular, as
<PB N="33" REF="030158_0031_0FE3FB167899BF00"/>
it is materially connected with, and seems a necessary consequence of, the leading features of their matrimonial system. This is one proof, among thousands that might be produced, of nations in a progressive state of im∣provement, stopping short, before they arived at the <HI>acme of perfection.</HI> But I hope our moral and political career will not be thus disgracefully marked. I trust, as we receive here the hardy German, the vivacious Ita∣lan, the volatile Frenchman, the grave Englishman, the hospitable Irishman, and the industrious Scotch∣man; that we shall cull from the man∣ners of these various nations, and
<PB N="34" REF="030158_0032_0FE3FB18921A9CF0"/>
form one national system superior to that of any of them.</P>
<P>Consistently with this idea, from England we shall borrow the mode of <HI>facilitating divorces,</HI> from which the French and Italians are in some de∣gree precluded, by a tenet of their re∣ligion, which prohibits a second mar∣riage, until the death of one of the parties. But our mother country (mother let her be, in dictating our manners, as well as in having settled the continent) has rendered separa∣tion in the fashionable world as easy as could reasonably be desired. Thus, for instance, when a married pair be∣come tired of each other, and the lady has chosen, among her <HI>male friends,</HI> a
<PB N="35" REF="030158_0033_0FE3FB1EA2FC0248"/>
future help-mate, with whose <HI>talents</HI> she is well acquainted, the three agree, that the wife and her gallant shall be found in such a situation, as to warrant a <HI>suit for divorce;</HI> which is immediately commenced—the parties are separated—and the lady trium∣phantly led to the altar by her para∣mour.</P>
<P>This is, in my humble opinion, the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of improvement in this way. Any attempts to change the system henceforward, must proceed in a retrogade direction. I am lost in astonishment and admiration at this important secret, reserved for this age of discovery. What inestimable con∣sequences it must have, in a <HI>political
<PB N="36" REF="030158_0034_0FE4B1430720BCD0"/>
moral,</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> point of view, is very evident to even a Baeotian capa∣city.</P>
<P>One of the good effects of the mo∣dern system, which had almost esca∣ped my notice, is the encouragement it will afford to the <HI>honourable</HI> and <HI>useful</HI> state of <HI>celibacy,</HI> which has so often mistakenly been the object of legislative vengeance, among nations of <HI>contracted</HI> manners. Many jealous pated fellows, who are incapable of sacrificing their <HI>squeamish</HI> sentiments at the shrine of fashion, will doubtless be fearful of embarking on the hyme∣neal ocean, left,
<NOTE PLACE="foot">A brace of proud antlers their brows 'should adorn.'</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="030158_0035_0FE4B145865EEF88"/>
And thus we shall have a hardy race of bachelors, ready for any <HI>ser∣vice</HI> their fair country-women may impose on them. The <HI>advantages</HI> arising hence, are too self-evident to require illustration. Many married men of my acquaintance can bear <HI>feeling</HI> testimony on this subject.</P>
<P>It is a distressing reflection to me, that I know not to whom the <HI>credit</HI> of introducing this fashion is justly due. Were I acquainted with the parties, I should pay them that tribute of <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>reverence</HI> which their conduct so richly deserves. But an enlightened posterity, while enjoying the benefits of this new system, will not be unmindful of them. Their
<PB N="38" REF="030158_0036_0FE4B148B2A2DC30"/>
reputation will survive to the latest times. They will be classed with the <HI>exalted,</HI> characters of other nations, who have had the undaunted resolu∣tion to desy the shafts of ridicule and satire, and spurn the shackles of shame, religion, morals, and manners.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Mr. Simon Spectacles.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE read in your second number the ironical defence of the prevalent fashion in high life, of hus∣bands not appearing in public with their wives. This fashion, which deserves the utmost reprobation, is pregnant with more and greater evils,
<PB N="40" REF="030158_0038_0FE4B14ECEC1D8E8"/>
than almost any other known in our country. I am happy you have ani∣madverted on it—and hope it will, by the efforts of our writers, be pro∣scribed from these states.</P>
<P>I beg leave to communicate to you a story, for the truth of which I pledge myself.

Maria Arnold was the daughter of a respectable merchant at Hartford, in Connecticut, and was, by bounteous providence, endowed with every ac∣complishment of head and heart, that could qualify her to act in the most exalted station. When arrived at sixteen years of age, her hand was sought after by numbers of the first rate characters in the city. Among the rest was Mr. Henry Winthrop, an eminent merchant, whose congeni∣ality of disposition soon acquired her esteem and regard. After an ac∣quaintance of a year, she received him on the footing of a lover; and in some months afterwards, they were
<PB N="42" REF="030158_0040_0FE4B154C8FC7210"/>
happily united together, at the hyme∣neal altar.</P>
<P>Become the wife of Mr. Winthrop, her virtues had a more extensive sphere of action—and expanded into the warmest affection for her husband—tenderness for her children (of whom she presented one to her hus∣band every thirteen or fourteen months)—charity and regard for her domestics—benevolence and friend∣ship for the circle of her acquaint∣ance.</P>
<P>When she was in her twenty∣seventh year, the happy mother of six children, esteemed and respected by all who knew her—beloved by her husband and children, the late war
<PB N="43" REF="030158_0041_0FE4B1565CF59AD0"/>
broke out by the fatal engagement at Lexington. Mr. Winthrop, attached to the British government, and accus∣tomed to look up to Great Britain with awe and reverence, could not relish the idea of resisting her power, which he regarded as a political sacri∣lege. He determined to make sale of his property, and retire to England. This design he speedily carried into execution—and arrived there early in the year 1777.</P>
<P>Possessed of an immense fortune—fond of high life—and allured by the attractions of the fashionable world, he commenced a career of gaiety and dissipation. The mutual attachment between him and his wife, which had
<PB N="44" REF="030158_0042_0FE4B158E1843B10"/>
subsisted uninterruptedly, and had indeed acquired new force every year of their connection, while they re∣mained in this country, was gradually weakened by the course of life they led in London. On his arrival, he paid the same kind of attention to his beloved partner, that he had been accustomed to. But he was told that it was a mere bore for a married man to gallant his wife—that he would be considered as a most unfashionable monster, should he be seen in her com∣pany in public—and that any appear∣ance of fondness for her, if discover∣ed, would subject him to the sneers and scorn of his acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030158_0043_0FE4B15B654DCA18"/>
These lessons he found it very dif∣ficult to digest. His ardent love could not brook such disguise and dis∣simulation. For a long time, there∣fore, he remained unfashionable in this particular, and in sometimes bringing his children into company. But as incessant exhortations and in∣cessant ridicule will turn almost any mortal from a purpose, however fixed; he at length gave way to fashion, and as cautiously avoided his wife's com∣pany in public, as he would the society of one of the furies.</P>
<P>Among the gentlemen who bestow∣ed their cares and attentions on Mrs. Winthrop, whose beauty shone with most distinguished lustre, was Sir Joseph
<PB N="46" REF="030158_0044_0FE4B15FA5DDA638"/>
Middleton, a man whose sole rule of conduct was the refined subtle system of Chesterfield. He had, on the plan of his master, sacrificed largely to the graces; and his sacrifices had not been in vain. To the attractions of a fine person, and enchanting address, he added a most refined and highly cultivated understanding. He had travelled—and engrafted the most elegant of the manners of France and Italy on those of England. Had not his heart been depraved by the seduc∣tions of fashion, he would have been an incomparable character. But into most of the vices of the times he en∣tered—more, however, from a deter∣mination
<PB N="47" REF="030158_0045_0FE4B1612F07DF08"/>
to be a fashionable man, than from the impulse of inclination.</P>
<P>From the moment that Sir Joseph singled out Mrs. Winthrop as the object of his gallantry, she rejected the rest of the surrounding crowd. To Vaux∣hall, to plays, to assemblies, to court, he daily led her, and, before many months had elapsed, almost entirely eradicated from her mind every trace of love or affection for her husband.</P>
<P>still was she virtuous even in thought. She did not know, or allow herself to believe, the hold Sir Joseph daily gained on her affections. He saw clearly, that to proceed with any hopes of success, it would be necessary to proceed with caution. Had he, in
<PB N="48" REF="030158_0046_0FE4B163E163A738"/>
an early stage of their acquaintance, even hinted at his real intentions, she would have spurned him from her with the most profound disdain and contempt. But this he carefully avoi∣ded, until he was fully assured of his conquest. When this was the case, he only lay in wait for an opportunity to perpetrate his black designs.</P>
<P>And here, Mr. Observer, allow me to pause for a moment, and recal your attention to the former situation of this lovely but falling angel. When possessed of virtue, she would have been an ornament to a throne—for as the poet justly observes,
<PB N="49" REF="030158_0047_0FE4B167585913F8"/>
<Q><L>Virtue is beauty—but when charms of mind,</L>
<L>With elegance of outward form are join'd—</L>
<L>When youth makes such bright objects still more bright—</L>
<L>And fortune sets them in the strongest light—</L>
<L>'Tis all below of heaven we may view,</L>
<L>And all but adoration is their due.</L></Q></P>
<P>But now her mind is in part depra∣ved—the remainder of Sir Joseph's vile triumph will cost him little trou∣ble.</P>
<P>One night at a masquerade ball, he artfully prevailed on her to drink pret∣ty freely of an intoxicating cordial, which, aided by the heat and inflam∣mation of her blood, occasioned by
<PB N="50" REF="030158_0048_0FE4B16A845279D0"/>
dancing, soon ascended her head, and deprived her of her faculties. On her return homewards, he gave the coach∣man directions to stop at the house of an infamous minister of his pleasures. Here, taking advantage of her helpless situation, and vowing eternal love and secrecy, he robbed her of that inesti∣mable jewel, which no tears, no repen∣tance can ever restore to lost, undone woman.</P>
<P>Sunk now into the depths of infa∣my, she felt, for a time, the keenest remorse for the crime she had been guilty of. But Sir Joseph took too much pains, not to remove her anxi∣ety. Frequent repetitions rendered her so callous and unconcerned, that
<PB N="51" REF="030158_0049_0FE4B16C0CB68828"/>
her guilt soon became public, and at length reached Mr. Winthrop's ears. This roused him from the lethargy into which his blind pursuit of a pre∣posterous fashion had thrown him. By the agency of a trusty servant, he gained information of an assignation between them. He went to the place, and was on the point of surpri∣sing them, but, notwithstanding all his vigilance, a confidante of his wife's gave her notice of his approach, so early as just to allow Sir Joseph time to escape by a back window. However, he left behind him his hat and part of his clothes, which afford∣ed sufficient proofs of his villainy, and of the guilt of Mrs. Winthrop.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="030158_0050_0FE4B16F859D8000"/>
The injured husband, in the first moments of his rage, was on the point of sacrificing her to his just resentment. But an instant's reflection made him determine not to imbrue his hands in female blood. He resolved to take vengeance of the adulterer—and next morning sent him a challenge, which was accepted. They met. They fought. Mr. Winthrop received a mortal wound—and expired, express∣ing his sorrow at having launched into such a scene of dissipation, which had destroyed his happiness—blasted his wife's reputation irretrievably—and hurried himself into an untimely grave.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="030158_0051_0FE4B1710D844808"/>
This dreadful catastrophe nearly brought her to a sense of her infamy.—She cast a retrospective eye on the scenes which she had passed through—she bewailed the deplorable gulph in which she was swallowed up—and made many strong resolutions of reformation, which, for a short time, she endeavoured to carry into effect. But Sir Joseph renewed his efforts to replunge her into her former condition. For a time he was unsuc∣cessful. But at length, when the poignancy of her grief was somewhat abated, and her contrition propor∣tionably diminished, she listened again to his insinuations—and was prevail∣ed upon to accept the hand of the
<PB N="38" REF="030158_0052_0FE4B175516304F0"/>
murderer of her husband, who now calls her his. They are immersed in all the scenes of profligacy and vice, which the capital of England affords—and I think you will allow, they furnish an awful lesson of the danger of adopting modish manners, and of departing from the paths of honour and rectitude.</P>

<P>—"Constable shall seize, and take into his possession, such and so much of the goods, chattles and effects of said delinquent, as shall be necessary."—"And if sufficient effects cannot be found, whereon to make distress, such constable shall take the body of any such delinquent, and deliver him of <HI>her</HI> to the sheriff, or keeper of the country jail, who shall detain such delinquent in close custody, without bail or mainprize, until payment made."</P>

<P>—"Is this, good God!" ex∣claimed I, "is this freedom? Is this what we have been so long contend∣ing for? Is this the fruit of a seven
<PB N="56" REF="030158_0054_0FE4B1795CA396B8"/>
years war? Farewell to heaven-born Liberty!"—</P>
<P>A cynical old man, who sat in a corner, his eyes half shut, and envelo∣ped in the smoke which he emitted from his mouth, in large volumes, knocking the dust out of his pipe, and staring me stedfastly in the face, asked me if I had read Sidney, Locke, Price, or any of the other celebrated writers on the subject of liberty, and if I understood what was the real im∣port of the word? My mind being somewhat untuned, and not choosing to enter the lists of controversy with a genius who had so forbidding an appearance as that which presented itself to my view, I replied in the ne∣gative.
<PB N="57" REF="030158_0055_0FE4B17CD9444300"/>
He then entered into a most elaborate disquisition on the nature of liberty—said that self-taxation was its very sum and essence—and was pro∣ceeding in a most copious and fluent harangue, when, wishing to indulge a little reflection, I called the waiter, desired him to pay himself out of a dol∣lar, for the coffee I had just drank—wished the haranguer a good day—and returned home—</P>
<P>Here, when I became a little com∣posed, I endeavoured to picture to my imagination the numbers who must inevitably taste of <HI>the bitter cup of misery</HI> "by virtue of this act." Sci∣zures, vendues, imprisonments, croud∣ed on my mind without end—While
<PB N="58" REF="030158_0056_0FE4B180378E2B00"/>
I was in this sympathetic frame of thought, the case of an unfortunate soldier, my bosom friend, my Pylades, suggested itself to my perturbed imagi∣nation.</P>
<P>My Pylades, as I used to call him, in return for the name of Orestes, with which he honoured me, had borne the fatigues and hardships, the hunger and thirst, of a seven years war—had been in almost all the principal engagements—had been several times taken prisoner, and put on board guard-ships, where he experienced what would have destroyed perhaps any other man—In all these vari∣ous scenes, these vicisstudes of for∣tune,
<PB N="59" REF="030158_0057_0FE4B181C3E99258"/>
he had conducted himself with a heroism, a magnanimity, which would put to shame the vounted fables of antiquity—After having undergone all this, he had, a few days previous to the termination of the war, fallen in defence of that country, whose rights and liberties he prized more than ex∣istence itself.—A tender spouse and six lisping children, the eldest not eight years old, would, in a short space, have been blest with his presence, had not a siend, in shape of an Indian, cut short his precious life—</P>
<P>Isabella, ill fated Isabella, the part∣ner of all his joys, and solace of all his cares, was panting in hourly expecta∣tion of his long wished for return:—
<PB N="60" REF="030158_0058_0FE4B18541963060"/>
her tender heart throbbed with every breath of wind, and the smallest mo∣tion, which flattered her with the de∣lusive hope of embracing once more the lord of her soul;—never! never! to be realized!—</P>
<P>Notwithstanding every possible pre∣caution was taken to prepare her for the direful news, in order to avoid the consequences to be feared from an ab∣rupt disclosure of her woe, she sunk lifeless on her couch, when the luck∣less tidings reached her ear, doomed never to hear a sound of joy!—One fit followed close on the heels of ano∣ther for two days successively—and at length, the extreme violence of her grief having somewhat subsided, she fell
<PB N="61" REF="030158_0059_0FE4B186C9B7C718"/>
into that state of torpor and apathy, which too often succeeds the paroxysms of madness and despair.</P>
<P>Her only not-adored Pylades had expended the little patrimony he was in possession of, in support of the cause of freedom and America—She was therefore left, in every sense of the word, desolate; and the small provision she was entitled to, as a recompense for his services, was totally inadequate to the support of herself and tender offspring!—</P>
<P>And perhaps, says I, in some short time hence, the amiable, the engaging Isabella, with accomplishments to adorn a crown, and to soften and har∣monize barbarity itself in human shape,
<PB N="62" REF="030158_0060_0FE4B18B64D11450"/>
perhaps she shall feel the relentless hand of some harpy catchpole, "by virtue of the funding bill"—The melan∣choly train of reflection into which this threw me, made me sink into a reverie, in which I conceived Isabella was assessed at a sum, trivial indeed to persons in affluence, but enormous to her—I beheld her borne down by the weight of affliction, lying on the bed of sickness, without a being to adminis∣ter comfort to her, except her dear children, the only objects of her care, on whom she cast many a wishful eye, recommending them to the care of her omnipotent Creator—</P>
<P>Thus afflicted, thus sorlorn, thus woe begone, a man of uncouth form, in the guise of a COLLECTOR, made
<PB N="63" REF="030158_0061_0FE4B18CEC210328"/>
his appearance—"Madam," he says, " I come for ten dollars, the sum at which you have been assessed by vir∣tue of a late act of assembly"—With faultering accents, and pallid counte∣nance, she articulated an assurance, that "if her life was at stake for a tenth of that sum, she must incur the forseit"—Well, madam," said he, "with a perfect <HI>sang froid,</HI> dart∣ing a most ferocious look at the heart∣broken mourner, you must abide the consequences."</P>
<P>After a tedious interval of forty days, the collector made his return to a justice of peace, who directly, with∣out enquiry, issued his warrant to a constable to distress and distrain, and
<PB N="64" REF="030158_0062_0FE4B18F6AD39F80"/>
in default, to take the body of the DELINQUENT into custody—</P>
<P>Methought I beheld this stone∣hearted constable possess himself of every article the house contained—while Isabella lay dissolved in a trance into which his unseasonable appear∣ance, and rough, savage behaviour had cast her—the two eldest of her young ones, wailing and lamenting around her, and the others gazing, with childish astonishment, at a scene, the horrors of which they were to∣tally incapable of conceiving.</P>
<P>A few days after seizure, a public vendue converted her little furniture to money, but so destitute had she been, that there was a deficiency in
<PB N="65" REF="030158_0063_0FE4B192E4D594A8"/>
the sum at which she had been asses∣sed.—</P>
<P>My heart sunk within me, on con∣templating the dreadful catastrophe, which closed the melancholy trage∣dy:—</P>
<P>The constable, with a posse, came and seized the unfortunate delinquent! He dragged her, half dead with afflic∣tion, distress, and despair, through the streets, to a loathsome jail. Here she was reduced to have recourse to a bed of straw! She, who had been accustomed to the endearments, the care, the attention, of a fond, an ador∣ing husband, whose chief study had been to anticipate her every wish, was now, sad reverse! without a being to
<PB N="66" REF="030158_0064_0FE4B19623D54378"/>
hand her a draught of water, to al∣lay the burning heart of a fever, which had seized and was preying on her—And in a few days, DEATH came to her relief, and called away her ange∣lic soul, to those regions of never-end∣ing happiness, which God has prepar∣ed for those he loves. Her breath was closed in prayers for her infants, and for the forgiveness of her persecutors!</P>
<P>Gracious Power! (ejaculated I) that watchest over the transactions of this sublunary world, how many such scenes will a short time realize, per∣haps in every corner of the state!—Is the "asylum" which, we fondly slattered ourselves, had been prepared "for the distressed and persecuted of

"all nations," destroyed?—Is the pleasing illusion vanished?

<HEAD>[From the Columbian Magazine, Sept. 1786.] SKETCH of the Life of the late NATHA∣NIEL GREENE, Major General of the Forces of the United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gallant officer, whose death is so generally and so justly regretted, was born in the town of Warwick, Kent county, Rhode-Island, in or about the year 1741, and was the second son of a respectable citizen of the same name, (descended from one of the first settlers of the colony) who was extensively concerned in lucrative iron-works, the property of which, at his death, (prior to the war) he left to his children.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="030158_0067_0FE4B19DE6E5B3E0"/>
The General was endowed with an uncommon degree of judgment and penetration, which, with a benevolent manner and assable behaviour, acquired him a number of valuable friends, by whose interest and influence, he was, at an early period of life, chosen a member of the assembly of the then colony of Rhode-Island. This trust, in which he gave the highest satisfac∣tion to his constituents, he continued to possess, until, and at, the period, when the folly and madness of Eng∣land severed a world from her em∣pire.</P>
<P>After the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord, when a spirit of resist∣ance spread, like wild-fire, over the
<PB N="70" REF="030158_0068_0FE4B1A146F1ADF0"/>
continent, Rhode-island was not defi∣cient in her contributions for the gene∣ral defence. She raised three regiments of militia, the command whereof was given to Mr. Greene, who was nomi∣nated brigadier-general. The liberty, safety, and prosperity of his country being exposed to imminent danger, the pacific principles of quakerism, in which he had been educated, proved insufficient to repress the ardent spirit of liberty with which his bosom glowed.</P>
<P>He led the troops under his com∣mand to Cambridge, and was present at the evacuation of Boston by a force which, in England had been vaunt∣ingly stated as treble the number that
<PB N="71" REF="030158_0069_0FE4B1A2D003C6F8"/>
would be requisite to dragoon America into unconditional submission.</P>
<P>General Greene's merit and abili∣ties, as well in the council as in the field, were not long unnoticed by gene∣ral Washington, who reposed in him the utmost confidence, and paid a par∣ticular deference to his advice and opinion, on all occasions of doubt and difficulty. This excited the jealousy of several officers, of older date and higher rank, who were not wanting in endeavours to supplant him: but in vain—the commander in chief knew and prized his worth as it deserved.</P>
<P>He was appointed major-general by congress, the 26th of August, 1776. Towards the close of that year, he
<PB N="72" REF="030158_0070_0FE4B1A550392320"/>
was at the Trenton suprize; and, at the beginning of the next, was at the bat∣tle of Princeton, two enterprizes not more happily planned than judiciously and bravely executed, in both of which he displayed his talents, serv∣ing his noviciate under the American Fabius.</P>
<P>At the battle of Brandywine, gene∣ral Greene distinguished himself by supporting the right wing of the Ame∣rican army, when it gave way, and judiciously covering the whole, when routed and retreating in confusion; and their safety from utter ruin was gen∣nerally ascribed to his skill and exer∣tions, which were well seconded by the troops under his command.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="030158_0071_0FE4B1A7D1280760"/>
At the battle of Germantown, he commanded the left wing of the Ame∣rican army—and his utmost endea∣vours were exerted to retreive the fortune of that day, in which his con∣duct met with the approbation of the commander in chief.</P>
<P>In March, 1778, he was appoint∣ed quarter-master general, which office he accepted under a stipulation that his rank in the army should not be af∣fected by it, and that he should retain his right to command in time of action, according to his rank and seniority.</P>
<P>In this station, he fully answered the expectations formed of his abilities; and enabled the American army to
<PB N="74" REF="030158_0072_0FE4B1AC13993640"/>
move with additional celerity and vigour.</P>
<P>At the battle of Monmouth, the commander in chief, disgusted with the behaviour of general Lee, deposed him in the field of battle, and appoint∣ed general Greene to command the right wing, where he greatly contribu∣ted to retrieve the errors of his prede∣cessor, and to the subsequent event of the day.</P>
<P>About the middle of the year 1778, an attack being planned by the Ame∣ricans, in conjunction with the French fleet, on the British garrison at New∣port, Rhode-island, general Sullivan was appointed to the command, under whom general Greene served. This
<PB N="75" REF="030158_0073_0FE4B1ADD5B3F438"/>
attempt was unsuccessful. The French fleet having failed out of harbour, to engage lord Howe's fleet, they were dispersed by a storm, and the Ameri∣cans were obliged to raise the siege of Newport; in doing which general Greene displayed a great degree of skill in drawing off the army in safety.</P>
<P>After the hopes of the British gene∣rals to execute some decisive stroke to the northward, were frustrated, they turned their attention to the southern states, as less capable of de∣fence, and more likely to reward the invaders with ample plunder. A grand expedition was, in consequence, plan∣ned at New-York, where the army embarked on the 26th of December,
<PB N="76" REF="030158_0074_0FE4B1B056AB5840"/>
1779, and landed on the 11th of February, 1780, within about thirty miles of Charleston, which, after a brave defence, was surrendered to Sir Henry Clinton, on the 12th of May.</P>
<P>A series of ill success followed this unfortunate event. The American arms in South Carolina were in gene∣ral unsuccesful, and the inhabitants were obliged to submit to the invaders, whose impolitic severity was extremely ill calculated to answer any of the ob∣jects for which the war had been com∣menced.</P>
<P>Affairs were thus cicurmstanced, when general Washington appointed general Greene to the command of
<PB N="77" REF="030158_0075_0FE4B1B3D36BAE00"/>
the American forces in the southern district. He arrived at Charlotte, on the second day of December, 1780, accompained by gen. Morgan, a brave officer, who had distinguished himself to the northward, in the expedition against Burgoyne. He found the forces he was to command, reduced to a very small number, by defeat and by desertion. The returns were nine hundred and seventy continentals, and one thousand and thirteen militia. Mi∣litary stores, provisions, forage, and all things necessary, were, if possible, in a more reduced state than his army. His men were without pay, and al∣most without clothing; and supplies of the latter were not to be had but from
<PB N="78" REF="030158_0076_0FE4B1B6CE2C1128"/>
a distance of two hundred miles. In this perilous and embarrassed situation, he had to oppose a respectable and vic∣torious army. Fortunately for him, the conduct of some of the friends of royalty obliged numbers, otherwise disposed to remain neuter, to take up arms in their own defence. This and the prudent measures the general took for removing the innumerable difficul∣ties and disadvantages he was surround∣ed with, and for conciliating the affec∣tions of the inhabitants, soon brought together a considerable force, far infe∣erior, however, to that of the British, who esteemed the country perfectly subjugated.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="030158_0077_0FE4B1B8588C7838"/>
After he had recruited his forces, with all the friends to the revolu∣tion that he could assemble, he sent a considerable detachment, under gene∣ral Morgan, to the western extremi∣ties of the state, to protect the well disposed inhabitants from the ravages of the tories. This force, which was the first that had for a considerable time appeared there, on the side of the Americans, inspired the friends of liberty with new courage, so that numbers of them crowded to the standard of general Morgan. He at length became so formidable, that lord Cornwallis thought proper to send colonel Tarleton to dislodge him from the station he had taken.
<PB N="80" REF="030158_0078_0FE4B1BADC9DBEA0"/>
This officer was at the head of a thou∣sand regular troops, and had two field pieces. He came up, on the 17th of January, 1781, at a place called Cow∣pens, with general Morgan, whose force was much inferior, and was composed of two-thirds militia, and one-third continentals. An engage∣ment was the immediate consequence.</P>
<P>The brevity of this sketch will not permit me to go into a detail of the dispositions made on either side. Let it suffice to say, that the brave Mor∣gan gained a complete victory over an officer, the rapidity and success of whose attacks, until that time, might have entitled him to make use of the declaration of Caesar, <HI>"veni, vidi,
<PB N="81" REF="030158_0079_0FE4B1BD60E72FF0"/>
vici."</HI> Upwards of five hundred of the British laid down their arms, and were made prisoners—a very considerable number was killed. Eight hundred stands of arms, two field-pieces, and thirty-five baggage-waggons fell into the hands of the victors, who had only twelve killed, and sixty wounded.</P>
<P>This brilliant success quite discon∣certed the plan of operations formed by lord Cornwallis. Having enter∣tained no idea of any enemy to oppose in South Carolina, the conquest of which he had deemed complete, he had made every preparation for carry∣ing his arms to the northward, to ga∣ther the laurels, which he imagined awaited for him. He now found him∣self
<PB N="82" REF="030158_0080_0FE4B1C0D8FAF178"/>
obliged to postpone this design. He marched with rapidity after general Morgan, in hopes not only to recover the prisoners, but to revenge Tarle∣ton;s losses. The Americans, by a ra∣pidity of movements, and the inter∣ference of providence,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The British urged the pursuit with so much rapidity, that they came to the ford of the Catawba on the evening of the same day on which the Americans had crossed it. Before the next day, a hea∣vy fall of rain rendered it impassable.—Had it risen a few hours earlier, the Americans would have had no chance of escape, and their prisoners would have been retaken by the enemy. Some time after, the same providential interference took palce in passing the Yadkin. A sudden and rapid rise, after the Ameri∣cans had crossed, prevented lord Corn∣wallis from getting over. [Vide Ram∣say, Vol. II p.206, 208.]</NOTE> eluded his

efforts, and general Greene effected a junction of the two divisions of his little army, on the 7th of February. Still was he so far inferior to lord Cornwallis, that he was obliged to retreat northward, and, notwithstand∣ing the vigilance and activity of his enemy, he brought his men in safety into Virginia.</P>
<P>In this state he received some rein∣forcements, and had the promise of more—on which he returned again into North Carolina, where, on their arrival, he hoped to be able to act on the offensive. He encamped in the vicinity of lord Cornwallis's army▪—By a variety of the best concerted ma∣noeuvres, and by the secrecy and
<PB N="84" REF="030158_0082_0FE4B1C5F4E240F8"/>
promptitude of his motions, he so ju∣diciously supported the arrangement of his troops, that during three weeks, while the enemy remained near him, he prevented them from taking any advantage of their superiority, and even cut off all opportunity of their receiving succours from the royal∣ists.</P>
<P>About the beginning of March, he effected a junction with a continental regiment, and two considerable bodies of Virginia and Carolina militia. He then determined on attacking the Bri∣tish commander without loss of time, being persuaded," as he declared in his subsequent dispatches, <Q>that if he was successful, it would prove
<PB N="85" REF="030158_0083_0FE4B1C8737923A8"/>
ruinous to the enemy—and, if other∣wise, that it would be but a partial evil to him.</Q> On the 14th he arri∣ved at Guilford court-house, the Bri∣tish then lying at twelve miles dis∣tance.</P>
<P>His army consisted of about four thousand five hundred men, of whom near two thirds were North Carolina and Virginia militia. The British were about two thousand four hundred, all regular troops, and the greater part inured to toil and service in their long expedition under lord Cornwal∣lis, who, on the morning of the 15th, being apprized of general Greene's intentions, marched to meet him. The latter disposed his army in three
<PB N="86" REF="030158_0084_0FE4B1CCB47FF4E8"/>
lines; the militia of North Caroilna were in front—the second line was composed of those of Virginia,—and the third, which was the flower of the army, was formed of continen∣tal troops, near fifteen hundred in number. They were flanked on both sides by cavalry and riflemen, and were posted on a rising ground, a mile and a half from Guilford Court House.</P>
<P>The engagement commenced at half an hour after one o'clock by a brisk cannonade. After which the Bri∣tish advanced in three columns, and attacked the first line, composed, as has been observed, of North Carolina militia. These, who, probably, had
<PB N="87" REF="030158_0085_0FE4B1CE400CD910"/>
never been in action before, were pa∣nic struck at the approach of the ene∣my, and many of them ran away with∣out firing a gun, or being fired upon, and even before the British had come nearer than 140 yards to them. Part of them, however, fired, but they then followed the example of their comrades. Their officers made every possible effort to rally them—but nei∣ther the advantages of their position, nor any other consideration, could in∣duce them to maintain their ground. This shameful cowardice had a great effect upon the issue of the battle. The next line, however, behaved much bet∣ter. They fought with great bravery; and after they were thrown into dis∣order,
<PB N="88" REF="030158_0086_0FE3FABE55061868"/>
rallied, returned to the charge, and kept up a heavy fire for a long time, but were at length broken, and driven on the third line, when the engagement became general, very severe, and very bloody. At length, superiority of discipline carried the day from superiority of numbers. The con∣flict endured an hour and a half, and was terminated by general Greene's ordering a retreat, when he perceiv∣ed, that the enemy were on the point of encircling his troops.</P>
<P>This was a hard fought action. Lord Cornwallis stated his losses in killed, wounded, and missing, at 532, among whom were several officers of consi∣derable rank. To those who are used
<PB N="89" REF="030158_0087_0FE4B1D0C3EAEE00"/>
to consider the thousands killed in the plains of Germany, very frequent∣ly without producing any visible con∣sequence on the fate of a war, the number here mentioned must appear insignificant. But this battle was, nevertheless, decisive in its consequen∣ces. Lord Cornwallis was, three days after, obliged to make a retrograde motion, and to return to Wilmington, situated two hundred miles from the place of action. He was even under the necessity of abandoning a consider∣able number of those who were most dangerously wounded.</P>
<P>The loss of the Americans was about four hundred killed and wound∣ed. However, this was not so severely
<PB N="90" REF="030158_0088_0FE4B207B7807F00"/>
felt, as the desertion of a considerable number of militia, who fled home∣wards, and came no more near the army.</P>
<P>Some time after this engagement, general Greene determined to return to South-Carolina, to endeavour to expel the British from that state. His first object was to attempt the reduc∣tion of Camden, where lord Raw∣don was posted with about nine hun∣dred men. The strength of this place, which was covered on the south and east sides by a river and a creek, and to the westward and northward, by six redoubts, rendered it impracticable to carry it by storm, with the small army general Greene had, consisting of
<PB N="91" REF="030158_0089_0FE4B1D345522308"/>
about seven hundred continentals. He, therefore, encamped at about a mile from the town, in order to prevent supplies from being brought in, and to take advantage of such favourable cir∣cumstances as might occur.</P>
<P>Lord Rawdon's situation was ex∣tremely delicate. Colonel Watson, whom he had some time before de∣tached for the protection of the eastern frontiers, and to whom he had, on intelligence of general Greene's inten∣tions, sent orders to return to Camden, was so effectually watched by general Marian, that it was impossible for him to obey. His lordship's supplies were, moreover, very precarious:—and,
<PB N="92" REF="030158_0090_0FE4B1D79001BB88"/>
should general Greene's reinforce∣ments arrive, he might be so closely invested, as to be at length obliged to surrender. In this dilemma, the best expedient that suggested itself, was a bold attack; for which purpose he ar∣med his musicians and drummers, and every person capable of carrying a mus∣quet. He sallied out on the twenty-fifth of April, and attacked general Greene in his camp. The defence was obstinate, and, for some part of the engagement, the advantage appear∣ed to be in favour of America.—Lieu∣tenant colonel Washington, who com∣manded the cavarly, had at one time not less than two hundred British pri∣soners. However, by the misconduct
<PB N="93" REF="030158_0091_0FE4B1D918F655C8"/>
of one of the American regiments, vic∣tory was snatched from general Greene, who was compelled to retreat. He lost in the action about two hundred kil∣led, wounded, and prisoners.—Lord Rawdon lost two hundred and fifty eight.</P>
<P>There was a great similarity between the consequences of the affair at Guil∣ford, and those of this action. In the former, lord Cornwallis was sucecss∣ful—but was obliged to retreat two hundred miles from the scene of ac∣tion, and for a time abandon the grand object of penetrating to the north <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard. In the latter, lord Raw∣don had the honour of the field, but was shortly after reduced to the neces∣sity
<PB N="94" REF="030158_0092_0FE4B1DB99457B80"/>
of abandoning his post, and leav∣ing behind him a number of sick and wounded.</P>
<P>The evacuation of Camden, with the vigilance of general Greene, and of the several officers he employed, gave a new face to affairs in South Caro∣lina, where the British ascendency declined more repidly than it had been established. The numerous forts, gar∣risoned by the enemy, fell, one after the other, into the hands of the Ame∣ricans. Orangeburg, Motte, Watson, Georgetown, Granby, and all the others, sort Ninety-six excepted, were surrendered; and a very considerable number of prisoners of war, with mili∣tary
<PB N="95" REF="030158_0093_0FE4B1DE1EE2D470"/>
stores and artillery, were found in them.</P>
<P>On the 22nd of May, general Greene sat down before Ninety-six, with the main part of his little army. The siege was carried on for a considerable time with great spirit: and the place was defended with equal bravery. At length, the works were so far re∣duced, that a surrender must have been made in a few days, when a re∣inforcement, of three regiments, from Europe, arrived at Charleston, which enabled lord Rawdon to proceed to relieve this important post. The superiority of the enemy's force, reduced general Greene to the alter∣native of abandoning the siege altoge∣ther,
<PB N="96" REF="030158_0094_0FE4B1E244BE1C80"/>
or, previous to their arrival, of attempting the fort by storm. The latter was more agreeable to his enter∣prising spirit: and an attack was made on the morning of the 29th of June. He was repulsed, with the loss of one hundred and fifty men. He raised the siege, and retreated over the Saluda.</P>
<P>Dr. Ramsay, to whom the writer of this sketch is indebted, for most of the facts herein contained, speaking of the state of affairs about this period, says,—"truly distressing was the situ∣ation of the American army: when in the grasp of victory, to be obliged to expose themselves to a hazardous assault, and afterwards to abandon the siege: when they were nearly masters
<PB N="97" REF="030158_0095_0FE4B1E3CCD04218"/>
of the whole country, to be compel∣led to retreat to its extremity: after subduing the greatest part of the force sent against them, to be under the ne∣cessity of encountering still greater re∣inforcements, when their remote situ∣ation precluded them from the hope of receiving a single recruit—in this gloomy situation, there were not wanting persons who advised general Greene to leave the state, and retire with his remaining forces to Virginia. To arguments and suggestions of this kind he nobly replied—'I will reco∣ver the country, or die in the at∣tempt.' This distinguished officer, whose genius was most vigorous in those extremities, when feeble minds
<PB N="98" REF="030158_0096_0FE4B1E682E7BE70"/>
abandon themselves to despair, adopt∣ed the only resource, now left him, of avoiding an engagement, until the British force should be divided."</P>
<P>Some skirmishes, of no great mo∣ment, took place between detached parties of both armies in July and August. September the 9th, general Greene having assembled about two thousand men, proceeded to attack the British, who, under the com∣mand of col. Stewart, were posted at Eutaw Springs. The American force was drawn up in two lines: the first, composed of Carolina militia, was commanded by generals Marian and Pickens, and col. De Malmedy.—The second, which consisted of con∣tinental
<PB N="99" REF="030158_0097_0FE4B1E9F64F3E78"/>
troops from North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, was com∣manded by general Sumpter, lieut. col. Campbell, and colonel Williams; lieutenant-colonel Lee, with his legion, covered the right flank; and lieuten∣ant-colonel Henderson, with the state troops, covered the left. A corps de reserve was formed of the cavalry, under lieutenant-colonel Washington, and the Delaware troops under capt. Kirkwood. As the Americans came forward to the attack, they fell in with some advanced parties of the enemy, at about two or three miles a-head of the main body. These being closely pursued, were driven back—and the action soon became general.
<PB N="100" REF="030158_0098_0FE4B1ECF18108E0"/>
The militia were at length forced to give way, but were bravely supported by the second line. In the hottest part of the engagement, gen. Greene ordered the Maryland and Virginia continentals to charge with trailed arms. This decided the fate of the day. "Nothing," says dr. Ramsay, "could surpass the intrepidity of both officers and men on this occasion.—They rushed on, in good order, thro' a heavy cannonade, and a shower of musquetry, with such unshaken reso∣lution, that they bore down all before them." The British were broken, closely pursued, and upwards of five hundred of them taken prisoners—They however made a fresh stand, in
<PB N="101" REF="030158_0099_0FE4B1EE7A95F0A8"/>
a favourable position, in impenetrable shrubs and a picquetted garden. Lieu∣tenant-colonel Washington, after hav∣ing made every effort to dislodge them, was wounded and taken pri∣soner. Four six pounders were brought forward to play upon them, but they fell into their hands; and the endeavours to drive them from their station being found impractica∣ble, the Americans retired, leaving a strong piequet on the field of battle. Their loss was about five hundred; that of the British upwards of eleven hundred.</P>
<P>General Greene was honoured by congress with a British standard, and a gold medal, emblematical of the
<PB N="101" REF="030158_0100_0FE4B1F1020FA238"/>
engagement and success, "for his wife, decisive, and magnanimous con∣duct, in the action at Eutaw springs, in which, with a force inferior in number to that of the enemy, he ob∣tained a most signal victory."</P>
<P>In the evening of the succeeding day, colonel Stewart abandoned his post, and retreated towards Charles∣ton, leaving behind upwards of se∣venty of his wounded, and a thou∣sand stands of arms. He was pursued a considerable distance—but in vain.</P>
<P>The battle of Eutaw produced most signal consequences in favour of Ame∣rica. The British, who had for such a length of time lorded it absolutely in South Carolina, were, shortly after
<PB N="103" REF="030158_0101_0FE4B1F384B05910"/>
that event, obliged to confine them∣selves in Charleston, whence they ne∣ver ventured but to make predatory excursions, with bodies of cavalry, which in general met with a very warm and very unwelcome reception.</P>
<P>During the relxation that followed, a dangerous plot was formed, by some turbulent and mutinous persons in the army, to deliver up their brave gene∣ral to the British. This treasonable design owed its rise to the hardships, wants, and calamities of the soldiers, who were ill paid, ill clothed, and ill fed. The conspirators did not ex∣ceed twelve in number: and a provi∣dential discovery defeated the project.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="030158_0102_0FE4B1F7FA48CAA8"/>
The surrender of lord Cornwallis, whose enterprising spirit had been by the British ministry expected to repair the losses, and wipe away the disgrace, which had been incurred through the inactivity and indolence of other gene∣rals, having convinced them of the im∣practicability of subjugating America, they discontinued offensive operations in every quarter. From the begin∣ning of the year 1782, it was cur∣rently reported, that Charleston was speedily to be evaucated: it was offi∣cially announced the seventh of Au∣gust; but did not take place until the seventeenth of December.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="030158_0103_0FE4B1F9867A0CF0"/>
The happy period at length arrived, when, by the virtue and bravery of her sons, aided by the bounty of hea∣ven, America compelled her invaders to recognise her independence. Then her armies, quitted the tented fields, and retired to cultivate the arts of peace and happiness. Among the rest, general Greene revisited his na∣tive country, where he proved himself as valuable a citizen, as the Carolinas had witnessed him a gallant officer. Dissensions and jealousies had extend∣ed their destructive influence among the Rhode Islanders, whose animosity had arisen to such a degree, as to threaten the most serious ill conse∣quences: general Greene exerted
<PB N="106" REF="030158_0104_0FE4B1FC06743CA8"/>
himself to restore harmony and peace among them once more; and was happily successful.</P>
<P>In October, 1785, he sailed to Georgia, where he had a considerable estate, not far distant from Savannah. Here he passed away his time, occu∣pied in his domestic concerns, until the hour of his mortality approached. Walking out one day in June 1786, he was overpowered by the extreme heat of the sun, which brought on a disorder that carried him off, a few days after, on the 19th of the same month.</P>
<P>When the melancholy account of his death arrived at Savannah, the people were struck with the deepest
<PB N="107" REF="030158_0105_0FE4B1FE868C29A8"/>
sorrow. All business was suspended. The shops and stores throughout the town were shut: and the shipping in the harbour had their colours half∣masted.</P>
<P>The body was brought to Savan∣nah, and interred on the 20th. The funeral procession was attended by the Cincinnati, militia, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Immediately after the interment of the corpse, the members of the Cin∣cinnati retired to the coffee-house in Savannah, and came to the following resolution:</P>
<P>"That as a token of the high re∣spect and veneration in which this so∣ciety hold the memory of their late illustrious brother, major-general

<P>General Greene left behind him a wife, and five children, the eldest of whom was about 11 years old.</P>
<P>On Tuesday the 12th of August, the United States in Congress assem∣bled came to the following resolu∣tion:</P>

<P>AMIDST an exuberant variety of fanciful and new-fangled opinions, lately obtruded on the public, and de∣fended with all the dexterity that casu∣istry can afford, there is none more absurd than that of those persons who decry and endeavour to prevent the migration of Europeans to America.

migration. Few, alas! are the repub∣lics of Europe: and from those few, emigration is extremely rare. And it may be made a question, whether the abject slaves or lordly aristocrats of Venice or Genoa, would be much more eligible persons to naturalize here, than the <HI>"subjects of monarchies,"</HI> however despotic. Those Germans to whom Pennsylvania owes so much with respect to agriculture, improve∣ments, industry, and opulence, were transplanted from the most despotic soils. Here they became meliorated, and have furnished some of the most active and zealous friends and support∣ers of America's independence. The same will hold equally true of those

numerous swarms of Irishmen, who both before and during the arduous struggle, came into this country.—Their valour and conduct were dis∣played by sea and land—and history will bear the most honourable testimo∣ny of their heroism.</P>
<P>What then becomes of the random assertions of this writer? What end can he propose to answer but to divide the people of this country, and create dissentions and ill blood between the old citizens, and those who are on every occasion spoken of with a kind of supercilious and impertinent oblo∣quy and contempt as <HI>new comers—new comers?</HI> Are not the unhappy divisions between constitutionalists and republi∣cans,
<PB N="117" REF="030158_0115_0FE4B21A1E32AAC8"/>
enough to impede and prevent the welfare and happiness of the state? Must more distinctions and differences be created, in order to counteract the efforts of true patriots to promote the common good? The monitorial page of history warns mankind incessantly, to beware of the shoals and quick∣sands to be dreaded from intestine divisions. The death-bed maxim of Micipsa, given to Jugurtha, "By unanimity weak states gather strength; by discord, powerful ones fall to ruin," has been wisely adopted as the motto of the United Provinces, and is equally applicable to the United States. To what was owing the fall of Carthage, of mighty Rome, of Mexico, of
<PB N="118" REF="030158_0116_0FE4B21C9E603AD8"/>
Peru? To intestine divisions. What fixed the power of the Macedonians in Greece?—What established the Romans in Greece, in Gaul, in Bri∣tain, and in almost all their conquests? What subjected Wales and Ireland to England? What crowned Henry the fifth of England in Paris? What prostrated China to the Tartars? What enabled three royal robbers to plunder Poland, and to strip it of some of its most valuable territories, and five millions of people? The in∣testine divisions of the inhabitants of those various countries. In sine, let history be carefully examined, and it will appear, that few empires, king∣doms, states, or republics, have ever
<PB N="119" REF="030158_0117_0FE4B2201C11D638"/>
been destroyed, without internal dis∣cord being one of the primary causes. Surely, then, he must be a most dan∣gerous enemy to this country, who endeavours to excite jealousy and dis∣union here, from which so many evil consequences must naturally and ine∣vitably arise. Let all such persons meet with the detestation and scorn they merit. Let the Americans, to use the words of this paragraphist, "give a preference to our old citizens," whenever their merit and abilities en∣title them to it. But should the <HI>new comer</HI> be found to possess those qua∣lities in a higher degree, let him not be exposed to neglect, abuse, or scur∣rility, merely because, actuated by a
<PB N="120" REF="030158_0118_0FE4B2235810FED8"/>
love of liberty, he has given this country a preference to his own, and abandoned his friends and relatives to coalesce with the inhabitants of Ame∣rica, who, as general Washington de∣clares in his farewel address, "HAVE OPENED AN ASYLUM FOR THE OP∣PRESSED AND DISTRESSED OF ALL NATIONS."</P>
<P>As this is a subject on which many well meaning persons have been led to form very erroneous opinions, by the artful insinuations of designing men, it will be allowable to pursue it a little further. In Europe, the im∣portance of preventing emigration is fully understood; and in most states no pains are spared to chain the in∣habitants
<PB N="121" REF="030158_0119_0FE4B224E01349D8"/>
to the soil. To entice ar∣tists and manufacturers from Britain is a high crime and misdemeanor: and, according to Chambers, in the same country, artificers in iron, steel, brass or other metal, or in wool, going out of the kingdom into any foreign country, without licence, are liable to be imprisoned three months, and fined any sum not exceeding one hundred pounds. And those who go abroad, and do not return on warn∣ing given by the British ambassadors, are disabled from holding lands by descent or devise, from receiving any legacy, &amp;c. and are deemed aliens. It is the same in several other states of Europe. Edward the third who
<PB N="122" REF="030158_0120_0FE4B2285EB6C718"/>
established the woollen manufacture in England, effected it by enticing some weavers from Flanders. Such was the origin of that trade which forms the basis of English opulence and commerce to this day. May not some of the emigrants from Europe, esta∣blish manufactures here which in time will prove equally lucrative and bene∣ficial? The impolicy of Lewis the fourteenth in revoking the edict of Nantz, and the consequent emigration from France of hundreds of thousands of valuable artists and manufacturers, imparted various arts to Germany, Holland, and England, whereof France had had an almost entire monopoly. Among these we may
<PB N="123" REF="030158_0121_0FE4B229E6E06C50"/>
enumerate the manufacture of paper, silk, looking glasses, &amp;c;. &amp;c;. The expulsion of the Moors from Spain tended greatly to the impoverishment of that country, and to the abridgment of its manufactures, trade, and com∣merce. Are not these and numerous other instances which might be addu∣ced, sufficient to prove how far sage policy requires America to hold out every possible encouragement to indu∣strious persons to migrate here, with their acquirements, their property, and their families? What then shall we say of those who are incessantly heaping scurrility and abuse on them? The answer is obvious. They must be either ignorant, illiberal, and
<PB N="124" REF="030158_0122_0FE4B22E7121E180"/>
mean persons: or those who have some selfish or party purpose to an∣swer by such a vile conduct. If the former be the case, they claim our pity or contempt: if the latter, our hatred.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. CHALMERS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman is, in some respects, the first performer in Ame∣rica. In others, he is second to Mr. Hodgkinson, who, as a general actor, stands undoubtedly at the head of his profession.</P>
<P>In genteel comedy, the palm must be given to Mr. Chalmers. In this
<PB N="126" REF="030158_0124_0FE4B232777F7948"/>
department he stands unrivalled. His Belcour cannot be excelled. He shines with distinguished lustre in this character, which is drawn in the happiest manner, and with all the fire and animation of a Congreve or Far∣quhar. To the violent passions—the punctilious sense of honour—the mag∣nanimity of this son of the torrid zone, Cumberland could not wish more complete justice done.</P>
<P>His Belville, in the school for wives, is nearly equal to Belcour, He assumes the variety that marks this character, with the utmost ease and propriety—and is by turns an affectionate, though a dissolute husband—an abandoned seducer—and a man of such true
<PB N="127" REF="030158_0125_0FE4B234FA923F58"/>
honor, as to refuse to raise his arm, except in self-defence, against him whom he has endeavoured to injure in the tenderest point, his sister's virtue.</P>
<P>His Modely, in the Farm House, gives the fullest expression to the author's ideas. The licentious man∣ners, the depravity of principle, the fascinating affability of this well-drawn portrait, sit on him as easy as the dress he wears.</P>
<P>In the Clandestine Marriage, he does ample justice to the excentri∣cities of that variegated character, Lord Ogleby—to his gallant and amiable attentions to the fair sex—to
<PB N="128" REF="030158_0126_0FE4B238F24D6930"/>
his vanity—to his generosity—and to his affectation of pristine vigour, while groaning under the excruciating tor∣tures, arising from his dissolute life.</P>
<P>His Vapid, in the Dramatist, is by no means inferior to the former. To this character and that of Marplot, in the Busy Body, it may be objected, that they are not within, they are beyond nature. They carry the improbable conspicuously stamped on their foreheads. Mr. Chalmers, however, by his excellent perform∣ance, almost induces the spectator to believe these personages not only probable, but actually before his eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="030158_0127_0FE4B23A8000A410"/>
In no character, perhaps, does he shine to more advantage, than in Pe∣ter Puff, in the Critic. To equal him in this, is difficult—to excel him, impossible. This part requires incessant exertion; and the spectator is lost in astonishment, at the un∣abated life and spirit, displayed for an hour and a half, during which mind and body have hardly a moment's relaxation. The humorous extem∣poraneous flights in which he occa∣sionally indulges, give the highest pos∣sible seasoning to the intellectual feast.</P>
<P>He has seldom attempted low co∣medy. But when he has, his success has been considerable. His Trappanti, in She Would and She Would Not,
<PB N="130" REF="030158_0128_0FE4B23DF1BA1A40"/>
is perfectly natural, and puts in the most conspicuous light all the roguery, cunning, and humour, that Cibber bestowed on the character.</P>
<P>I have but seldom seen him in tragedy, and am therefore, not fully competent to pass an opinion on him as a tragedian. So far, how∣ever, as I have seen, his abilities in this line are inferior to those he dis∣plays in the former. In awful or terrific scenes, he verges towards rant—he works himself into a degree of violent passion, which often affrights, but sometimes fails of exciting the sen∣sibility of the spectator.</P>
<P>His Hamlet is, however, extremely well performed. In the interview
<PB N="131" REF="030158_0129_0FE4B23F794A1788"/>
with his mother, he is truly great—and likewise when the players repre∣sent their tragedy before the king and queen.</P>
<P>His La Motte, in Fontainville Fo∣rest, is not equal to the former. This character is hardly natural, and is therefore the more difficult to re∣present. However, the storm of conflicting passions, by which he is impelled forward to the perpetration of the crime that threw him into the power of Lord Montault, is fully and forcibly expressed in his countenance and manner.</P>
<P>To conclude, Mr. Chalmers pos∣sesses all the essential qualifications that constitute a capital performer.
<PB N="132" REF="030158_0130_0FE4B243CF885950"/>
His address is easy and unconstrained—he hardly ever requires the Promp∣ter's aid—his delivery is equally becoming and natural in the volu∣bility of Peter Puff—the airy flights of Belcour—the seductive sophistry of Belville—or the tardy but monitory repentance of Beverly.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER II. Mrs. WHITLOCK.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS I shall not be charged with injustice or partiality, when I venture to pronounce this lady the first actress in America. In Tra∣gedy, she stands at a great distance from every rival; and her abilities in genteel comedy are very great, far beyond what are usually met with in those who excel in the former department. In the terrific, the awful, the pathe∣tic scenes of highly finished tragedy, she has an unlimited command over
<PB N="134" REF="030158_0132_0FE4B247D7C37F00"/>
the feelings of the spectators. And it not unfrequently happens, that hardy veterans, unappalled in the field of battle, bear testimony, by the trickling tears, "coursing, each other down their cheeks," to her astonishing powers. I have never seen a performer, not even excepting the far-famed Mrs. Seddons, who has been able to excite in me such highly pleasurable emotions, as I have repeat∣edly experienced from the excellent performance of Mrs. Whitlock.</P>
<P>In that unfeeling character, Lady Macboth, she displays, in its genuine colours, that headlong ambition, which stifles the voice of humanity, of loyalty, of honour, and of female timidity,
<PB N="135" REF="030158_0133_0FE4B24B50A14748"/>
Her madness is admirably counter∣feited.</P>
<P>In Milton's Masque of Comus, she adds new dignity, by the force of the most excellent delivery, to the exal∣ted sentiments of that great writer.</P>
<P>Who, that has seen her Mrs. Be∣verley, in the Gamester, can with∣hold admiration and applause, at the tenderness, the sensibility, the distress, the so naturally exhibits in the various stages of this useful, this instructive tragedy?</P>
<P>Eliza Ratcliffe, in the Jew, is by no means so interesting as the former character; however, her sensibility and terror, on the rupture between her husband and brother—her perfect reli∣ance
<PB N="136" REF="030158_0134_0FE4B24E48030E50"/>
on the honour of the former, when he solemnly promises to avoid any further quarrel—her respectful behaviour to Sir Stephen Bertram, in their interview—her anxiety and sus∣pence, when she apprehends his con∣gratulations on her supposed sudden good fortune, are only ironical re∣proaches of her real poverty—and her joy at the happy reconciliation between her husband and his family, are expressed with great justice and propriety.</P>
<P>In the Orphan, she performs Moni∣mia, in a capital manner. Her well expressed love for the gentle Castalio, and dislike for the brutal Polydore—her agonizing torture at the scorn and
<PB N="137" REF="030158_0135_0FE4B250C7228DA8"/>
contempt she experiences from her husband—her horror at the disclosure of the incestuous, but involuntary con∣nections with her brother-in-law—and her subsequent madness and death, cannot fail of receiving the loudest tributes of applause from every judi∣cious spectator. And could excel∣lence of acting compensate for the grossest fundamental errors of a dra∣matic composition, Mrs. Whitlock in Monimia, Mr. Chalmers in Chamont, Mr. Whitlock in Acasto, and Mr. Moreton in Castalio, might warrant a repetition of this tragedy. But the grossness of many of the sentiments expressed by polydore—the disgust∣ing incident on which the entire inte∣rest
<PB N="138" REF="030158_0136_0FE4B2524D761F08"/>
of the piece turns—and the multi∣plied butchery which closes it, ought to consign the Orphan to eternal ob∣livion.</P>
<P>In that finished portrait, Lady Elea∣nor Irwin, in Every one has his Fault, she appears to as much advantage, as in any of the characters she assumes, Filial tenderness and affection spurned to the ground by an unrelenting and hard-hearted father, cannot possibly find expression beyond what she exhi∣bits. The corroding cares of a tender wife, whose loved and loving husband is in danger of an ignominious death, are most pathetically depicted in her countenance, and by sympathy affect the spectators with a portion of her
<PB N="139" REF="030158_0137_0FE4B254CF9AB870"/>
distress. But what can be beyond the grand scene in which she disco∣vers her long-lost son, and strug∣gles between her regard for him and her love for his father, whether, at the expense of the former, she shall keep the fatal pocket-book, or restore it, to the danger of the latter? This exquisite treat for feeling minds is hardly equalled—but certainly not excelled by any scene ever written in our language; and to the praise of Mrs. Whitlock, it must be said, that the merit of the actress is at least equal to that of the author.</P>
<P>To conclude. Mrs. Whitlock has a dignified carriage; her pronunciation is animated; her voice and her coun∣tenance
<PB N="140" REF="030158_0138_0FE4B258EFC96DD0"/>
are capable of every inflection necessary to express the most opposite emotions and passions, with the utmost promptitude—her memory is so good, and her application so assiduous, as to leave her little indebt to the prompter's aid—and, except her person, which approaches towards the masculine, she has every qualification desirable in an actress.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER III. Mr. HARWOOD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman, who, perhaps, ranks next to Mr. Chalmers, among the male performers, is in high favour with the amateurs of the drama.—At his entré here, he attracted little attention—but suddenly came forward with great and unexpected eclat.</P>
<P>The first character in which he made a considerable figure, was that of Dr. Lenitive, in the prize, or 2, 3, 5, 8, in which he charmed the spec∣tators,
<PB N="142" REF="030158_0140_0FE4B25E01FBB4A8"/>
by his humour and originality—the avarice of this disciple of Galen, his gross ignorance, his ridiculous pedantry, his upstart pride, on his sup∣posed good fortune, were most admi∣rably personated. The spectator was led into that agreeable delusion which deceives him into a belief, that the transient scene is acting on the great stage of the world, which constitutes the chief merit of a good performer.</P>
<P>His Fretful Plagiary is even supe∣rior to Lenitive. He does complete justice to the testiness of this literary shark, and to his affected indifference for and agonizing torture under the cauterizing criticisms of the news∣paper writers.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="030158_0141_0FE4B25F88BF5970"/>
His Walter in the delightful after∣piece of the Children in the Wood, is well performed, but inferior to Hodgkinson's.—However, he has improved considerably in the successive representations. His song of "Doro∣thy Dump" is extremely well sung, and accompanied with natural and highly humourous gestures. In the interview with Oliver, whom he en∣deavors to dissuade from his in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tion of murdering the infants, and in the scene where they are brought in by their parents, he is equal to Hodgkin∣son. The parts in which he is inferior, are, when he is discovered by Sir Rowland, and throughout in his courtship with josephine, which Mr.
<PB N="144" REF="030158_0142_0FE4B263C61EBA08"/>
Hodgkinson represents with more true nature and grace.</P>
<P>His Sir David Dunder, in Ways and Means, gives great satisfaction. His articulation is particularly adapted to the volubility of this hospitable knight; as likewise to that of</P>
<P>Prattle, in the Deuce is in Him, in which his performance was extremely natural.</P>
<P>His Jabal in Cumberland's Jew, was received with great applause, as he filled the character with perfect propriety.</P>
<P>In the Baron of Oakland, Haunt∣ed Tower, Fulmer in the West-Indian, and the Planter in Yarico and Inkle, he appeared to no great advantage.
<PB N="145" REF="030158_0143_0FE4B2654D00E350"/>
In the first, the affected dignity of the base usurper did not seem to become him.</P>
<P>In Old Barnacle in the Romp, he displays the rough <HI>noli-me-tangere</HI> manners of a boisterous son of the waves, extremely well.</P>
<P>His Canton, in the Clandestine Marriage, is as good a representa∣tion of the finicking, fantastic, and fawning manners, bestowed in most English plays on French characters, as any I have seen. But it is to be hoped, that in "this country of good sense," we will rise superior to the despicable and odious vice of holding up the inhabitants of any country, or professors of any sect, as objects of
<PB N="146" REF="030158_0144_0FE4B267D058C8B0"/>
ridicule, to gratify our over-weening vanity by the flattering comparison.</P>
<P>His Mayor of Coventry and Jef∣fery Latimer are judiciously played and command great approbation.</P>
<P>From his great success in humour∣ous characters, it was hardly supposed that his powers were calculated to do justice to the tenderness of conjugal love. But who enjoyed the exqui∣site pleasure communicated by the interview with his Sall in the Purse, that did not instantly acknowledge how egregious was the mistake? Gar∣rick himself could hardly have ex∣ceeded him in this scene, had he played the part. It was affecting to the highest degree. The soul that
<PB N="147" REF="030158_0145_0FE4B26B496430A8"/>
can be unmoved at such a capital dis∣play of the most interesting emotions of the human breast, must partake largely of the nature of "the rugged rhinoceros, or the Russian bear." In∣deed, throughout the whole of the Purse, his performance is highly just and natural.</P>
<P>To conclude. Mr. Harwood is an extremely valuable actor. His merits in many characters are of the first rate. He can assume as great a variety of countenance and manner as any per∣former in this city. His articulation is either rapid as the falls of Niagara, or slow and stately as the meandering Susquehanna, according to the charac∣ters he represents. He is, however,
<PB N="148" REF="030158_0146_0FE4B26EAFEF3D80"/>
often indebted to Mr. Rowson's aid—which, whether it arises from defect of memory, or want of application, is certainly a considerable drawback on the gratification received from his performance. He is young, and im∣proving, and bids fair, at no very distant period, to arrive at a very un∣common degree of reputation in his profession.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER IV. Mrs. MARSHALL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS enchanting little actress possesses as high a degree of favour as any performer that ever appeared in America. Nature has been uncom∣monly liberal to her. She has a plea∣sing figure, and a prepossessing coun∣tenance, which, if any dependance is to be placed on physiognomy, is "the title page to a most captivating vo∣lume." Her voice is sweet and har∣monious. She sings agreeably, and more naturally, than some whose vocal
<PB N="150" REF="030158_0148_0FE4B273EE6699E0"/>
powers and execution are far superior to hers, in the opinion of the amateurs.</P>
<P>Her performance of the Country Girl has been pronounced by compe∣tent judges nearly equal to that of the celebrated Mrs. Jordan, who, in Eng∣land, is regarded as having arrived at the <HI>acme</HI> of excellence in this charac∣ter. The craft and artifice, bestowed by native instinct, to counteract the selfish and base designs of her super∣annuated guardian, are admirably co∣vered by the most natural and impo∣sing simplicity.</P>
<P>Her Edward, in Every One has his Fault, is equal to any of her cha∣racters. She divides with Mrs. Whit∣lock the merit of that most admira∣ble
<PB N="151" REF="030158_0149_0FE4B275755DED20"/>
scene, in which the mother and son discover each other. Her well∣supported suspence and anxiety, while torn with rival passions—gratitude to her grandfather for his protection, and irresistible silial love for her mo∣ther—cannot be too highly praised. The distress she displays, at parting with her grandfather, when love tri∣umphs over gratitude, is highly natu∣ral.</P>
<P>In the Spoiled Child, she is always received with unbounded applause. Never did port ill-mannered boy with more nature, naiveté, and spirit, har∣rass an old-maidish aunt, or play on the foibles, and take advantage of the blind side of a doting fond father,
<PB N="152" REF="030158_0150_0FE4B279B3256DF8"/>
than this actress. She assumes the dress, and with the dress the genuine manner of the young tarpaulin, with the utmost ease. And in this disguise, one time of performance, she recei∣ved as genuine a tribute, as was ever bestowed. The story has been alrea∣dy told in the papers; but I shall, I hope, be pardoned for repeating it here. A sailor in the pit, was so charmed with the air, the manner, of her singing the song
<Q><L>"Yo yea,"</L></Q>
that he emptied his pocket of his last dollar, which he threw on the stage, to testify his satisfaction at the perfor∣mance of "the little gem'man," as he termed her. But, poor fellow, he
<PB N="153" REF="030158_0151_0FE4B27B4096A668"/>
was rather roughly handled; for the action being mistaken for an insult, he was driven out of the house, amidst the hisses and abuse of the spectators.</P>
<P>In Emily, in the Deuce is in Him, her performance is natural and spirited. But nature, in choosing the materials for her composition, threw in an over proportion of the risible. Humour and merriment are, therefore, her predominent qualities. Nature some∣times triumphs, in spite of every effort to disguise or counteract her. This was never more perceptible, than in the interview with her limping lover, colonel Tamper, whose awkward and disfigured appearance so completely tickled her fancy, that she could not
<PB N="154" REF="030158_0152_0FE4B27EB97997B0"/>
resist the impulse to laughter, at a moment when she wished to appear in the utmost distress. The same cir∣cumstance has occurred on someother occasions. It is hoped the little char∣mer will attend to this friendly hint, and in serious parts, lay in a suitable stock of gravity.</P>
<P>In Priscilla Tomboy, she is hardly equal to Mrs. Hodgkinson, who shines in this character.</P>
<P>Her Josephine is extremly well performed, and I think superior to Mrs. Hodgkinson's. In the lover's altercation, and in pa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing with the children, her merits are very great.</P>
<P>In India <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she represents to advantage, the novel-reading miss.
<PB N="155" REF="030158_0153_0FE4B28044E7F370"/>
The disappointment of her scheme of an elopement—her chagrin at the mor∣tifying prospect of being thrice called in church, and kissed by the greasy church-warden—and her resentment at the imposition practised upon her, are unexceptionably well played.</P>
<P>Her Moggy M'Gilpin, in the Highland Reel, is truly excellent.</P>
<P>Her Page, in the purse, is highly interesting. Her song of
<Q><L>"When I was a little he,"</L></Q>
is enchanting. The display of affec∣tion for her mother, on the perusal of her letter, and the pathos of her in∣treaties for a continuance of her pa∣tron's friendship, are chefs d'oeuvre.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="030158_0154_0FE4B2843A191F88"/>
In fine. Mrs. Marshall may, as a general actress, aspire at a first rank in America.—The degree of favour she acquired on her arrival here, be∣ing founded on the base of intrinsic excellence, has gained additional strength in proportion as she has been the subject of critical examination. She can with equal ease, grace, and propri∣ety assume the for ard, pouting airs of an awkward countryminx—the im∣pertinence of a rude boy, better sed than taught—the staid manners of a well-educated lady—and the softness and tenderness of a Juliet. In all her extensively variegated line of acting, she meets with well earned plaudits. And it is to be hoped, that she will
<PB N="157" REF="030158_0155_0FE4B285C884C170"/>
ever bear strongly impressed in mind the large share of esteem she has at stake—and be as careful in preserving, as she has been happy in acquiring, the unanimous good wishes of her libe∣ral patrons, the citizens of Philadel∣phia.</P>

<HEAD>ADVANTAGES OF OVER-TRADING.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In a Letter to a Friend.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have asked my opinion respecting over-trading, of which you seem to be highly afraid. But I hope so clearly to point out its advantages, as to remove all your scruples, and to induce you to pursue the steps of so many of your fellow citizens, who enjoy all the comforts and conveni∣ences of this laudable practice.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="030158_0157_0FE4B28BCC614408"/>
With all my partiality for it, I freely acknowledge, that its benefits do not appear very evident, but at particular seasons, and during times of stagnation.—When business is brisk, one is tempted to overlook the advan∣tages. But he must be a most incor∣rigible sceptic, that can doubt its bles∣sings, when money is scarce, when trade is dull, when banks curtail dis∣counts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the first place, during the winter and summer months, when business is at a stand, and nothing doing, what resource can a man have, who has not over-traded, to keep himself employed? None. He is devoured by vapours, by ennui, by listlessness.
<PB N="160" REF="030158_0158_0FE4B28F099D3268"/>
Time hangs on his hands a heavy burden.</P>
<P>But mark the contrast. The man who has run himself comforably in debt, to the amount of 15, 20, or 30,000 dollars, has not an unemployed vacant hour, day or night. As soon as he rises in the morning, he has to exercise himself in walking over the city to borow a few dollars here and there—What a charming opportunity it gives a man to see his acquaintance! How acceptable must his visits be, which are certain title-pages to a beggarly request for money! What a touchstone he is to prove the sincerity of his friends!—When he lies down at night, slumber flies from his pillow,
<PB N="161" REF="030158_0159_0FE4B2909AE62778"/>
and his whole attention is turned to devise siscal arrangements for the fol∣lowing day.</P>
<P>As times grow worse, these com∣forts increase. You have the pleasure sometimes of borrowing daily, to pay the succeeding morning or afternoon. What a respectable sight it is, to behold you or your clerk, sneaking to the bank after the directors have gone away, to anticipate, by a few hours, the knowledge of their decision upon the notes you have offered! What a mournful countenance you exhibit, when your notes are returned to you, hanging out of your book, with the mark of the beast on them! How you puff and blow running about
<PB N="162" REF="030158_0160_0FE4B2932DEF4ED0"/>
from street to street, to borrow money, and get into bank before three o'clock! What a number of promises you make, impossible to be performed!</P>
<P>As the climax rises, new shifts open to your view. To over-draw is a most capacious one. It stays for a while the impending torrent of dis∣tress. What a charming exercise for your dexterity, to keep your book out of the hands of the clerks, lest they should seize it, and expose how frequently the balance is on the wrong side!</P>
<P>When borrowing is at an end, and the clerks of the banks grow too wary to allow you to over-draw, a further advantage arises. You are
<PB N="163" REF="030158_0161_0FE4B295D11D7070"/>
introduced to the acquaintance of that very worthy and conscientious race of men, who seem born for the relief of persons in distress. I mean the friendly class of usurers. You may at first hire money of them, at one per cent. a month—afterwards at two—and, as their <HI>charity</HI> grows with your distress, it will probably rise to four or five, if your sufferings should be so great as to excite an extraordinary degree of sympathy in their tender hearts.</P>
<P>You will probably think that this is the ne plus ultra of the advantages of this mode of doing business. So did I at first. But I soon discovered my mistake. Rats, they say, desert a
<PB N="164" REF="030158_0162_0FE4B298EA9E89A8"/>
sinking ship. They are warned by the instinct bestowed on them by mother nature. The usurers possess an instinct similar to this—and generally smell out a sinking firm, from which they contrive to make an early escape. Then your acquaintance extends fur∣ther. A worthy man, whom they call a notary public, kindly calls on you, brightens up your recollection of a note you forgot to pay a bank, and demands payment, which you are not able to make. This visit, sup∣posing you are possessed of any sensi∣bility, displays your countenance to great advantage. The pleasing mix∣ture of charming red with which it
<PB N="165" REF="030158_0163_0FE4B29BA59F4578"/>
suffuses your cheeks, heightens your natural beauties to the utmost degree.</P>
<P>I have not noticed the amount of the interest you pay. Supposing you to have the moderate sum of 12,000 dollars of bank money in trade, you do not pay much more than 1,000 dollars a year. This is a mere baga∣telle, unworthy of notice. Indeed, were it not for some such drain as this, it would be impossible to find employment for the immense profits of trade at present.</P>
<P>Another advantage which I passed over, is, the improvement in polite∣ness and good behaviour, which you derive from your cringing visits to directors and presidents of banks—
<PB N="166" REF="030158_0164_0FE4B29F22C6FC10"/>
your dancing attendance at their levees—your requests, they will be so kind as to pay attention to your notes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I might extend the enumeration much farther—but shall conclude for the present with the observation, that the man who involves himself by over-trading, has, in the fullest sense of the words, <HI>"taken up his cross"</HI>—a cross which half a life may be too little to enable him to lay down again.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Oct. 19, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ARE the present times, really and <HI>bona fide,</HI> as distressing and calami∣tous, as they are universally said to be? This question, which to many will appear as ridiculous as to de∣mand, does the sun preside over the day, is asked with all the coolness and gravity of a stoic, and a serious answer is requested. Locke has some∣where observed, that a want of as∣certaining
<PB N="168" REF="030158_0166_0FE4B2A503124140"/>
with precision the ideas con∣veyed by words in general use, is one of the most abundant sources of hu∣man ignorance and error. Perhaps, without incurring the charge of para∣dox, it may be added, that the most familiar terms are often least under∣stood. The <HI>ignobile vulgus,</HI> (with "reverence due and submission" be it said, five-sixths of mankind) pick up a set of phrases, which they repeat, parrot-like, by rote, without con∣ceiving any clear idea of them, or being able, if required, to define their meaning,—Lest, therefore, our ideas of distress and calamity should not co∣incide with those of our readers, we will ask a question or two.—What is
<PB N="169" REF="030158_0167_0FE4B2A68C2E9378"/>
distress?—What is calamity?—Some folk, very probably, think it <HI>mighty distressing,</HI> that a man who begins bu∣siness with a slender capital, or per∣haps on the <HI>broad bottom</HI> of a patched∣up credit, cannot keep his country house, his phaeton, his chaise, or even his pair of horses; that he cannot have above half a dozen dishes smoak∣ing on his table every day—nor en∣tertain his friends <HI>en homme comme il saul.</HI> This is all the fault of the <HI>damned bad times!</HI>—It is, indeed, <HI>mighty calamitous,</HI> that the blind god∣dess Fortune should have been so unkind to many <HI>sunny boys, hearty fellows, jovial souls, sprightly lads,</HI> and others of that noble fraternity, as
<PB N="170" REF="030158_0168_0FE4B2A90B62E6D8"/>
to have made them sons and heirs of poverty and empty purse, at the same time that <Q>Nature indulgently en∣dowed them with all the <HI>innocent desires, appetites, wishes</HI> and <HI>passions,</HI> of dukes and earls;</Q> so that while they have all the faculties and talents requisite to shine with <HI>wonderful eclat,</HI> in the sporting away some thousands per annum, they are obliged to confine themselves to the <HI>obscurity</HI> and <HI>insig∣nificance</HI> of their stores—<HI>What a piti∣able case!—</HI> It is also <HI>dreadfully dis∣tressing,</HI> that a clerk or shopkeeper, who is <HI>charitably</HI> and <HI>innocently</HI> dis∣posed to provide for a <HI>female friend,</HI> in some retired country spot, such as Kensington, Germantown, &amp;c.—ride

out ten or a dozen miles to dinner on Sundays—play a few games at billi∣ards now and then—<HI>keep it up</HI> two or three nights in the week—and in∣dulge himself in various other <HI>equally harmless</HI> modes of recreation, should be obliged, by the <HI>general dullness of the times,</HI> to stupify himself <HI>plodding over his waste-books, his journals</HI> and <HI>his ledgers,</HI> or <HI>warming his toes,</HI> kick∣ing the threshold of his employer's door—and all this owing to the <HI>dead∣ness of the season, bad times, scarcity of money, stagnation of trade, &amp;c.</HI>—Is it not also <HI>a most lamentable consi∣deration,</HI> that an artizan or mechanic, who could find a thousand <HI>laudable ways</HI> of recreating himself at <HI>billiards,
<PB N="172" REF="030158_0170_0FE4B2B083BCF860"/>
bowls, tennis, all fours,</HI> &amp;c. or over his glass of <HI>cherry bounce,</HI> his <HI>brandy∣sling,</HI> or his <HI>bowl of bub,</HI> should be obliged, by the mere severity of the times, to work six days in the week, at <HI>so very low a rate</HI> as five, six, se∣ven, or eight dollars?—Hard must be the heart of him who can hear of all those <HI>unparalleled miseries and dis∣tresses,</HI> without shedding—<HI>tears of blood.</HI>—We may justly cry out with the Mantuan bard—<HI>"Quis, talia sando, temperet a lacrymis?"</HI></P>
<P>A truce with irony—or (as the four cynic will say) with nonsense. Do not people in general live comfortably here? Have not bankruptcies (the most insallible <HI>criteria</HI> of bad times)
<PB N="173" REF="030158_0171_0FE4B2B20B4ADE80"/>
subsided for a considerable time past? Do not manufacturers ordinarily find a ready vent for all the goods they make? Is not the number of unem∣ployed mechanics very small?—If the intelligent reader shall answer these questions in the affirmative, it is an obvious inference, that the pre∣sent times cannot, in strict propriety of language, be called calamitous or distressing.</P>
<P>Whoever pursues this very interest∣ing reflection to a greater extent, will probably agree, that of the few who give themselves the trouble of think∣ing, by far the major part have only confused ideas of even the most fami∣liar terms; whence all their premises
<PB N="174" REF="030158_0172_0FE4B2B5876D9898"/>
and conclusions are involved in a chaos. This is the only mode of ac∣counting for the universality of the outcry against the misery of the times. That there is vastly less money here at present than immediately subse∣quent to the conclusion of the late war, is incontestible: but with nations as with individuals, happiness de∣pends not upon wealth. Is the cit, possessed of his tens of thousands, or the planter, owner of boundless acres, and numerous corps of the swarthy victims of his avarice and pride, in∣trinsically happier than the merry cobler, who sits in his stall, singing,
<Q><L>I care for nobody, no, not I,</L>
<L>If nobody cares for me!"</L></Q>
<PB N="175" REF="030158_0173_0FE4B2B70FD22BC0"/>
Are the lazy enervate sons of Mexico and Peru, who annually deluge Eu∣rope with their gold, silver, and pre∣cious stones, happier than the hardy, innocent, and poor inhabitants of Switzerland? In the scale of reason and common sense, doubtless not. To pursue this analogy:
<Q><L>Reason's whole pleasure—all the joys of sense</L>
<L>Lie in three words—health, peace, and competence."</L></Q></P>
<P>So sung Pope, relatively to the happiness of individuals: what is true of them will equally hold with respect to aggregate bodies—for whatever constitutes the happiness of one man, should equally conduce (whim and
<PB N="176" REF="030158_0174_0FE4B2BB11483990"/>
caprice excluded) to that of his neighbour—and so on, <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> It is unnecessary to add, that if each member of a society be happy, the society itself must consequently be so. What is deducible from this?—That Pennsylvania, posessing a <HI>healthy</HI> climate—being in the enjoyment of <HI>peace</HI>—and producing more than is necessary to procure a supply of all those articles (if any such there be) which she must have recourse to fo∣reign nations for, [i.e. in other words, being possessed of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>] if she be not really happy, she must charge it to the account of her own folly, imprudence, and party squabbles.</P>
