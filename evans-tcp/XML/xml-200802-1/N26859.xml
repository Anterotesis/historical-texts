<HEAD>THE ADVANTAGES AND PRAISES OF WISDOM. A SERMON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PROVERBS, XII.8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>A man shall be commended according to his wisdom.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS proverb states to us, not only what ought to take place, but what commonly does take place in the affairs of men. A man receives praises and honours in a measure proportioned to the powers of his mind, the knowledge he has acquired, and the discreet use which he makes of his reason and talents. Possibly, in some instances, commendation may not, immedi∣ately, succeed the exercises of wisdom and knowledge; but, in process of time, a man's talents and wisdom shall be duly acknowledged, and celebrated. These praises are the more valuable, as they are the natural and just reward of eminent and profitable attainments.</P>
<P>What I testify, in such strong terms, of the superior excellency and dignity of wisdom, you will not mis∣apprehend, nor mistake my words, as though by wis∣dom, I intended the mere strength of a man's intellect∣ual powers aided and improved by science and literature. This is obvious, that a man of great original genius and of greater acquired talents in the arts and sciences, may still be a man void of understanding and discretion, and to be reprobated for his folly and perverseness, in the misapplication of his powers and attainments.</P>
<P>Wisdom is a moral virtue: It implies a disposition to turn our discoveries to beneficial purposes; to pro∣mote the interests of others, and the purity of our own hearts. Knowledge usefully employed, is alone entitled
<PB N="6" REF="035750_0006_10066395A4E720D8"/>
to the name of wisdom, and is essential to the existence of it. Wisdom is the knowledge of what is fitting and best to be done under existing relations and circum∣stances. It is the discovery of the <HI>fit</HI> and the <HI>useful,</HI> and the avoiding of the <HI>unsuitable</HI> and <HI>injurious.</HI> Wisdom is ever attended with singular advantages, and of con∣sequence, how to obtain it, ought to be among our first, and most solicitious enquiries.</P>
<P>I am, at this time, to give you a lecture upon wis∣dom. The occasion calls your attention to this subject. Happy should I be, could I place it to your view, in an advantageous, and inviting point of light. What is wanting, in the execution, your candour will excuse, and your own reflections supply.</P>
<P>Wisdom, is a lucrative and profitable attainment. The man, who, among imperfect men, possessed the greatest share of wisdom, and well knew its advantages, has left this testimony in its favour.
<Q>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. For the merchandize of it is better than the merchandize of silver, and the gain thereof, than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: And all the things thou canst desire, are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her.</Q></P>
<P>We see men pursuing enjoyment, in amassing silver and gold, and rubies; in acquiring titles, honours, and stations of rank and power; seeking happiness in bodily health, and length of days, in the indulgence of pleasure, and the gay scenes of amusement. Solomon tried all these various methods of happiness. But, what was the result of his experiments? It was, that wisdom and understanding possess all the advantages to be obtained by those other acquisitions, without any of their con∣comitant
<PB N="7" REF="035750_0007_1006639743031E40"/>
evils. Wisdom secures the desired end of human happiness, while other pursuits are empty and fruitless. Wisdom is the only mean to secure that en¦joyment, which is the perpetual object of human desire. Wisdom is better than strength, beauty, and comely proportion; than health, long life, amusement and pleasure: It is better than monies, lands, mortgages and obligations; than rich trappings and splendid wardrobes: It is better than victories and triumphs; than titles, honours, thrones.
<Q>Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom, and with all thy getting, get understanding. Exalt her, and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her. She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace; a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</Q>
Thou shalt be com∣mended according to thy wisdom.</P>
<P>And why shall men be commended according to their wisdom? For this simple reason, <HI>that wisdom ren∣ders men useful.</HI> Wisdom is an operative virtue, pro∣ducing the most salutary effects. Nothing is important, or valuable, in the character of man, which does not render him beneficial to others, either by his example, or by his labours. Wisdom, is the qualification, which enables us to subserve the interests and happiness of our fellow men.</P>
<P>Ignorance and folly, render one insignificant and contemptible, because he is unprofitable and incapable of advancing those useful designs and enterprizes, on which rest the happiness and glory of society. He knows not how to choose, he is not disposed to pursue measures for the common good.
<Q>Wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness,</Q>
for
<Q>the wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in darkness.</Q></P>
<P>The man of wisdom contemplates his various rela∣tions; studies and learns his own powers; and applies
<PB N="8" REF="035750_0008_1006639A5111C040"/>
those powers to the improvement and well being of his connections and associates. As it is his wish to see others in an eligible and prosperous situation, so he has the means and capacity of ameliorating their condition, of assuaging the griefs and augmenting the joys of human life. The higher are his attainments in science and wisdom, the more extensive are those effects which benefit human society.</P>
<P>To the wise man, must we look for those instances of moderation, self government, chastity, purity, self de∣nial, placability, and munificence, which exhibit man the example, the ornament, and the admiration of the world. Wisdom teaches to subdue unruly passions and moderate inordinate desires. This marks the wide distinction between a continent refined Scipio, and a ferocious brutal Alexander. This discriminates the humane Patriot and Saviour of his country, from the unfeeling conqueror and butcher of his fellow men. This stamps with glory an ADAMS, a WASHINGTON; while folly and madness stain with infamy a French Directory.</P>
<P>Do the virtuous of every age and country, read with delight the history of Joseph? Do they propound his example for the imitation of their children and youth? Wisdom has enrolled his name among the worthies of our race, and stamped his reputation with deathless fame. Was it, that he was the son of his old age, that Jacob loved him? No, it was because, as our translation should have copied it from the original Hebrew, "He was as wise as a Senator." His su∣perior wisdom excited the groveling and implacable envy of his foolish and froward brethren to plunge him into the horrible pit: But the discerning eye of provi∣dence raised him thence, exalted him to honour and glory, and led him into Egypt, to save much people alive. A foreseeing and faithful mind, rescued him from the lewd enticements of an insidious harlot, event∣ually
<PB N="9" REF="035750_0009_1006639D48D3FAB0"/>
set him in the second chariot of the kingdom, made him a father unto Pharaoh, and the deliverer of God's famishing heritage.</P>
<P>The omniscient mind, foreseeing the future meek∣ness, fidelity, and wisdom, of his servant Moses, pre∣pared him for the great and eminent services to which he was afterwards raised; plucked him from that destruc∣tion to which he lay exposed, in the fens, and among the Crocodiles of Egypt; placed him in the house of the devout and pious Jochebed, to be instructed in the sublime truths of the Hebrew faith; and removed him in maturer age, to the court of Pharaoh, that he might be acquainted with all those arts and sciences, for which, the Egyptians were then so famous. Thus was he furnished with a knowledge of the sublime doctrines of the true religion, and was deeply versed in all the wis∣dom of human science. He was
<Q>Learned in all the wisdom of Egypt, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</Q>
Thus, by the fostering care of his parents, and the attending blessing of heaven, Moses, in process of time, was magnified as one of the most distinguish∣ed and useful characters in the page of history.
<Q>And there arose not a prophet since, in Israel, like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face: In all the signs and wonders, which the Lord sent him to do, in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land: And in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.</Q></P>
<P>What but unparelleled wisdom, spread abroad the fame of Solomon, into all lands? Princes, from the ut∣termost parts of the earth, came to see and to hear his wisdom. His own happy subjects submitted themselves to him with emulous duty, and grateful love, when they perceived,
<Q>That the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="035750_0010_1006639F0F85C140"/>Why was St. Paul exalted to a distinction and eminence, superior to all the blessed Apostles of the holy Jesus? Why was the greater part of the christian scriptures the production of his pen? Why are his acts and labours peculiarly noticed and celebrated in the inspired oracles? He was crowned with these honours, in con∣sequence of that unsual strength of mind, and that re∣fined education, which were superadded to his extraor∣dinary purity, and his ardent love to Christ. His use∣fulness, and of course, his reputation, were abundant∣ly increased by the force of his genius, and his learned education in the schools of Greece, and at the feet of Gamaliel.</P>
<P>But most of all, let our recollection dwell upon the example of the HOLY CHILD JESUS. This was the glory of his infant years, that, as he grew,
<Q>He waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</Q>
So diligent was he to improve and enlarge his mind with truth, that at twelve years of age, he confounded and put to silence, all the learned scribes and disputers of the Jewish temple. When he manifested himself the instructor of a perishing, de∣luded world, all men marvelled at his doctrines, say∣ing, "Whence hath this man this wisdom?" And they testified of him, "Never man spake like this man." This was the glory of Christ, that he knew how to de∣vise, and was wise and faithful to accomplish the works of human happiness and salvation; that work which his Father had given him to do. For his wisdom and integrity, in the execution of his trust, God has highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name which is named in earth or in heaven: He has com∣manded all the angels of God to worship him, and to honour the Son even as they honour the Father.</P>
<P>In these illustrious patterns, now set to view, you perceive the beneficial effects, you approve the praises of wisdom. Are you her progeny? You will cele∣brate
<PB N="11" REF="035750_0011_100663A0942FB598"/>
her praises—"For wisdom is justified of her c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dren." Do you emulate the glories of the instruc∣tors, the reformers, the benefactors, and the saviours of the world? Write after their copy and you shall participate their fame. Apply your minds to knowl∣edge; study to be useful, and you shall, ultimately, wear an unfading crown. You shall erect to your memories, a monument more durable than brass, a monument which shall outlive the ravages of time.</P>
<P>Do I perceive your minds enflamed with the love of wisdom? Do you appreciate its worth? Do you wish to possess this more than golden treasure? Let me, in a cursory and partial manner, point the way in which you may secure this inestimable prize.</P>
<P>Would you acquire a wise and an understanding heart? Then duly estimate your noble part, your in∣tellectual and immortal mind. This is the dignity of your natures, the ethereal breath of your omniscient creator. By this are you enabled to think—to reason —to judge—to act a part worthy of rational, moral, and spiritual agents. That attention which too many pay to the mortal body, you must pay to the immortal mind.</P>
<P>Respect yourselves as rational beings, fitted for <HI>in∣tellectual</HI> pursuits and <HI>angelic</HI> happiness.</P>
<P><HI>To know ourselves,</HI> is an essential branch of wisdom. Without this knowledge, the highest attainments in the arts and sciences, will leave us in a state of deplorable weakness and folly. Man can never be wise, unless he knows his own powers, and for what pursuits his genius and situation in life best fit him. He has made a happy discovery, who has learned the tendency and force of his own mind, and for what employments in life, the Author of his being has prepared him.</P>
<P>But this discovery is not enough. He must cultivate and strengthen his powers by study and exercise. We learn most rapidly in the school of experience. The
<PB N="12" REF="035750_0012_100663A4131E7090"/>
man, who seldom awakes his mind, by energetic exer∣tions, who lets his talents rust in idleness, is like Samp∣son, sleeping in the lap of Delilah. Roused, by exertion, the mind feels its strength; brightened, by exercise, it knows how to direct its force to the best advantage.</P>
<P>Having discovered in what line we can be must use∣ful, prudence will direct us to pursue that line: And by application to it, we shall not fail of gaining a lauda∣ble distinction, and of being highly useful to all our con∣nexions.</P>
<P>Possibly, you modestly think, that you are destined to the inferior attainments of knowledge; to walk in the lower steps of wisdom? But this, in you, may be false modesty. You have not, duly considered, to what lofty heights, you may arise, by a course of dili∣gence, perseverance and enterprize. "<HI>Nil desperandum" To despair of nothing,</HI> should be the motto of those who aspire after wisdom. Prodigies of learning and wisdom have emerged from small and unpromising beginnings.</P>
<P>Fortitude, an inflexible resolution of mind, are essen∣tial to the acquisition of eminent degrees of knowledge. Be not afraid of the labour and expense of getting wis∣dom. It was a proverb of the ancients, "<HI>Veritas in puteo" Truth is in the bottom of a well.</HI> You must draw it out, with labour and perseverance. Solomon gives a sanction to this proverb, when he tells us, that to get wisdom, we must <HI>search for her as for silver, and dig for her as for hidden treasure.</HI> The lazy man, the slothful soul, can never be replenished with truth and knowledge.</P>
<P>Not only industry, but order and method are equal∣ly requisite in the pursuit of wisdom. We must or∣ganize and arrange our studies, and turn our minds upon subjects in their due order, and according to their importance, or we must despair of success.</P>
<P>To one who asked that great statesman, pensionary Dewitt, <HI>How he performed so much business in so short a period?</HI> He replied, <HI>by doing one thing at a time.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="035750_0013_100663A6F9C43D10"/>Be always doing: Study method and order; lose no opportunity; keep strait forward, and you will be as∣tonished at your own progress. You will leave hurry∣ing, bustling, wandering travellers, far behind.</P>
<P>But let us, always, recollect the distinction between a pursuit of wisdom and the pursuit of knowledge. To improve and enlarge our minds, that we may be useful and do good to others, is the pursuit of wisdom. But he pursues knowledge, only, who studies for amusement, and seeks those showy parts of learning, by which, he may make a blaze, and dazzle the eyes of gaping, ill judging, spectators. But, if you know yourselves, your talents, your opportunities, and cir∣cumstances, and redeem your time from unprofitable studies, and from enervating indolence, and apply all your discoveries to some good account, for the im∣provement and felicity of God's creatures, then do you seek, then shall you attain to true and saving wisdom. For this end, no part of human science is to be neg∣lected, by which the purpose of doing good may be promoted. The art of becoming great and eminent, is, by gaining practical knowledge, the knowledge of doing to others the most extensive benefits.</P>
<P>Our personal applications to study and literature, should be in order to qualify ourselves for usefulness. Every effort we make, to advance useful knowledge in society, is a mark, no less of our wisdom, than of our benevolence.</P>
<P>The object of parents, in the education of children, is to enlarge their minds, and direct them into such a train of reasoning, and to inspire them with such bene∣ficial sentiments, as will best fit them for the active em∣ployments of doing good. To store their minds with useful ideas, and practical sentiments, is to leave them the best legacy in a parent's gift.</P>
<P>All institutions of learning, are to be fostered and encouraged, as they lay the foundations, in the minds
<PB N="14" REF="035750_0014_100663A885E70068"/>
of youth, of future usefulness. What youth acquire, in this way, will be a durable inheritance, when wealth and titles decay. While parents sleep in the dust, the precious fruits of their care and foresight, in the good instruction of their children, will be tasted by succeed∣ing generations.</P>
<P>As, knowledge is essential to wisdom, and the arts and sciences are handmaids to virtue, and give energy and success to the feelings of benevolence, so, we can∣not be too assiduous in acquiring knowledge for our∣selves, or in promoting it among those with whom we are connected in society; especially among the youth, the rising hope of our country. Is he to be commend∣ed, who drinks deep at the fountain of knowledge? How much more worthy of our admiration and grati∣tude, is he, who liberally devises the ways and means of disseminating science and wisdom, among our numer∣ous youth of both sexes? He makes provision, not only, that the Fathers, but, that the future Mothers of our race, may be richly furnished to train up their chil∣dren to learning and virtue, and to become the Timo∣thies, and Pauls, the Moseses, and Solomons, of suc∣ceeding ages.</P>
<P>In pleasing anticipation of these future benefits to community, do I, now, gratefully, discharge the duties of my appointment, in making an honourable mention of the laudable zeal, of those worthy citizens of <HI>Deer∣field,</HI> who have made such copious subscriptions, and donations, for the purpose of establishing a seminary of learning in this place. In aid of their noble exertions, and in answer to their petitions, the Legislature of this Commonwealth, have granted a charter of ample privi∣leges for the establishment of an Academy, by the name of DEERFIELD ACADEMY; and have endowed it with a valuable tract of land, for the encouragement and support of the institution.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035750_0015_100663AA1EEC90A0"/>The gentlemen, who, by the act of incorporation, are entrusted with the interests and government of the Academy, have been enabled, by the munificence and energies of the friends of science, to erect an elegant building, for the accommodation of those numerous youths, who may wish to tread the paths of truth and virtue, and qualify themselves for future service in church and state. The Trustees have been mindful of that sacred deposit, which the bounty of individuals and of the public, have placed in their hands. They have been diligent to accomplish the wishes and expectations of the public and of individuals.</P>
<P>Having completed the academic edifice, they have procured an instructor, for the education of those chil∣dren, and youth of both sexes, who may be committed to his care. Having received ample testimonials of the literary and moral character of this instructor, the Trustees do, this day, with auspicious hopes, present him to the public, <HI>the first Preceptor of Deerfield Acade∣my.</HI> As occasions may require, other able and virtu∣ous instructors, will be provided for teaching the useful branches of knowledge, and leading the youthful mind to wisdom and happiness.</P>
<P>In this the Trustees are happy, that their wishes for the prosperity of the institution are anticipated and ex∣ceeded. By the liberality of several private donors, the foundation of a Library is already laid, which they wish to see increased by additional favours from muni∣ficent and enlarged minds. The improvement of the pupils, would, in this way, be abundantly increased, and the interests of literature greatly promoted.</P>
<P>A surprising progress, for so short a period, has been made, in the collection of rare and valuable curiosities into the Museum of the Academy, where the minds of the inquisitive and philosophical, may be luxuriously fed, in contemplating the productions of nature and art.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035750_0016_100663AF3524C838"/>Nor have the friends of science and humanity, been unmindful of the advantages of endowing the institu∣tion with a suitable apparatus, for aiding the enquiries of naturalists and philosophers, and for promoting the knowledge of the pupils, in the more sublime parts of learning. Provision is made for valuable additions to the present small beginnings of this infant institution.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the Trust, are deeply impressed with a feeling and grateful sense of their high obliga∣tions to Mr. DAVID WELLS▪ of Greenfield, Deacon JONATHAN ARMS, and Mrs. ABIGAIL NORTON, for their munificient donations to the Academy, for the purpose of procuring a philosophical apparatus. Fol∣lowing years shall celebrate this liberality and largeness of heart. Future generations shall reap the harvest of their bounty.—And new patrons of this happy institu∣tion shall emulate their virtues.</P>
<P>It is, with pleasing confidence expected, that the friends of freedom, of order, of science, and of reli∣gion, will be the friends of Deerfield Academy. It will be the care and felicity of the Trustees, to merit the approbation and encouragement of such worthy patrons. They will labour to improve, with oeconomy, the revenues of the corporation—to impart to youth its many privileges and advantages—to provide instruc∣tors, who, by example▪ and teaching, shall advance the interests of learning—of liberty—of social order—of wisdom—of virtue—and of christianity. They will, humbly, endeavour, when they shall be called off, from this honourable service, that this trust be com∣mitted to faithful men. That their labours may be animated, may be wisely directly, and happily succeed∣ed, may a gracious God give to his servants, wise and understanding hearts. May the Almighty Ruler of the Universe, ever have the Academy, its officers and members, in his holy keeping.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="035750_0017_100663B0BB8457E8"/>To draw to a close, may this respectable assembly, who now worship God in this house of prayer, and honor the cause of literature, by their presence, at the consecration of the Academy, to the purposes of knowledge and virtue, duly, appreciate their privileges, in this land of liberty, of light, and of christian knowl∣edge. May they cultivate their own minds with wis∣dom and virtue.</P>
<P>Would you, my hearers, be useful in time, and wise for eternity? Let me, last of all, and most of all, en∣treat you to go to the Babe of Bethlehem, and learn of him, who was meek and lowly, and you shall find rest to your souls. Go without the gates of Jerusalem, and set under his cross, where he bore your shame and ex∣piated your guilt. There, while you hear the tongues of scoffing wits, and blaspheming infidels, deride the doctrines and insult the griefs of your dying Redeemer, you shall be compelled, in admiration of the mystery of eternal wisdom, to cry out, "Truly, this man was the Son of God." In that Cross, which was to the Jews, a stumbling block, and to the Greeks, foolish∣ness, you shall see and adore the wisdom of God, and the power of God to your salvation.</P>
<P>Do you realize a careless inattention to the most im∣portant truths? Do you feel yourselves perishing in your sins? Do you perceive the dark glooms of infi∣delity, and the hopeless despair of modern philosophy? Do doubts and perplexities accompany your meditations upon the grave? Is all beyond conjecture and uncer∣tainty? Look to the sufferer on Calvary; enter the tomb of Joseph, of Arimathea; hear the earthquake, ushering in the Resurrection of Jesus; go to Olivet; stand gazing up to heaven, until you see the ascending Jesus, received out of your sight. These scenes shall pluck the scales from your eyes; shall dispel your doubts; shall silence your fears; shall fill you with joy
<PB N="18" REF="035750_0018_100663B299C89218"/>
unspeakable and full of glory.—For by him, who hath died and risen again,
<Q>Life and Immortality are brought to light.</Q></P>
<P>With what more salutary exhortation can I conclude this discourse,
<Q>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men, liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him. Take fast hold of instruction, let her not go; keep her, for she is thy life.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN and FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have now, under the smiles of divine providence, arrived to a period which we have been anticipating with pleasure, when we have an opportunity to dedicate this Academy, to the literary and virtuous purposes, for which it has been erected.—Upon this occasion, in the name of the Trustees, I commit to you, Mr. BROWN∣SON, the key of the Academy, and office of Preceptor. And you, sir, being thus introduced into this seminary, in its infancy, to begin the rearing and improvement of it, your situation is of consequence, to yourself, to the Pupils, and many others. Upon your exertions and success, as a preceptor, we conceive the future en∣couragement, and prosperity of this institution, much depend. It is our ardent wish, that you may fulfil the pleasing expectations which arise from the character, under which you come recommended, in teaching and governing the children and youth committed to your care, and in forming their minds and manners; and under your fostering hand, with the aid and patronage of others, may this institution flourish, and for many years to come, afford those means of instruction which shall be highly beneficial to individuals, and eventually, to the public.</P>
