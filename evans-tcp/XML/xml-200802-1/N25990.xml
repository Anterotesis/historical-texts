<HEAD>ADVENTURES OF PEREGRINE PICKLE.</HEAD>
<P>PEREGRINE PICKLE was the son of Mr. Gabriel Pickle, who had formerly kept a shop in London, but the profits of his trade not answering to his wishes, he retired to Corn∣wall, where he purchased an estate, and married a young lady, the daughter of a country gen∣tleman. His sister, Miss Pickle, a maid of about forty, had been for several years his housekeeper, but there being no occasion for her in that ca∣pacity, after he was married, she began to look out for a husband. She was too old to attract the notice of the gentry, and because her father had been once Lord Mayor of London, so she could not bear the thought of giving her hand to a tradesman.</P>
<P>It happened that in the same neighborhood lived Commodore Trunion, who had been bred up to the sea, and spent most of his days in the
<PB N="4" REF="034563_0003_0FFE2BA074D5CD78"/>
navy. He lived in a house fortified in the same manner as a castle, and besides his domestics, he kept along with him one Lieutenant Hatchway and Tom Pipes, who had formerly been his boatswain's mate. With these two he used to spend the evenings at a neighboring alehouse, where he became acquainted with Mr. Pickle, and soon after proposed marrying his sister. Not that the commodore was in love, but that because he could go no more to sea, he proposed to take a voyage in the sea of matrimony. Like an honest tar he was downright in his proposals, and as the lady found it would be needless to as∣sume those airs peculiar to her sex, she soon gave her consent, and a day was fixed for the nuptials.</P>
<P>The commodore had purchased a couple of fine hunters for himself and the lieutenant, on which they mounted at nine in the morning to proceed for the church, but as he had never seen any thing but naval affairs, he resolved to tack about with the wind, as if he had been on the ocean. It happened that the wind shifted about, and the commodore followed his course so long, that his bride waited for him at church with the utmost impatience. At last it was thought necessary to dispatch a messenger in quest of him, for he was so little acquainted with the church, that it was supposed he had mistaken the road.</P>
<P>This, however, was not the case, for the mes∣senger found him and his attendant veering about
<PB N="5" REF="034563_0003_0FFE2BA074D5CD78"/>
with the wind like a fleet at sea, and told him that the company were waiting for him at church. The commodore answered with great deliberation, that he had weighed anchor about nine in the morning, for the port of matrimony, but the wind had shifted so often about, that he believed he would not be able to get to the har∣bor that day. As the messenger did not know what he meant, he told him that he had no more to do than turn his horse's head and follow him, by which they would be at the church in less than half an hour. The commodore was so much exasperated at what the messenger said, that he called him an ignorant fellow, who did not understand the trim of a vessel, and there∣fore desired him to sheer off, or he would pour into him a whole broadside. The messenger, who found what sort of a person he had to deal with, left him, and returned back to the church, where he found the company, and the ceremony was obliged to be deferred till next day.</P>
<P>In the mean time the commodore kept shifting about with the wind, till the horses on which he and Lieutenant Hatchway rode, heard the noise of huntsmen, and being well acquainted with the sport, they set out at full gallop, leaving the rest of the company to weather the storm in the best manner they could. Both the commodore and lieutenant believed they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the back of devils incarnate, and giving up all for
<PB N="6" REF="034563_0004_0FFE2BA1F8836840"/>
lost, dropped their whips, and held fast by the pummels of their saddles.—The horse on which the lieutenant rode, was more nimble than the other, and getting before, he crossed into a field of clover, which circumstance gave Hatch∣way an opportunity of throwing himself off, without receiving any other hurt than what arose from his fright.</P>
<P>In the mean time the commodore, who had dropped his hat and wig, came up, and seeing Hatchway, called out, "Hilloa! you have got safe into port, I wish to God I was moored." The commodore had some hopes that a five bar∣gate that stood opposite to him, would stop the progress of his horse, but no sooner did he ap∣proach it, than he jumped over with as much case as a cat would do over a harpsicord. He was now in a state of insensibility, he knew not whether he was dead or alive, and at last com∣ing to a highway, enclosed by two rising grounds, the horse jumped over it, to the no small terror of a waggoner, who happened to be passing un∣derneath.</P>
<P>By this time the commodore oververtook the horse on which the lieutenant had rode, and both kept an equal pace together, till they came to the place where the huntsmen were assembled to see the death of the fox. The strange figure of the commodore in his seamen's dress, joined to the loss of his hat and wig, attracted the notice of the whole company, and led off their atten∣tion
<PB N="7" REF="034563_0004_0FFE2BA1F8836840"/>
from poor Reynard, whose agility had furnished them with so much diversion. The two horses were exceeding good ones, and the 'squire who conducted the sport, asked the com∣modore if he would fell them. "Sell them! aye master; for they are above my weather gage, I have commanded a whole fleet, but was never so much out of my reckoning as to day." The 'squire finding that the commodore was a meer novice in land affairs, purchased the horses for one fourth of what they cost, and took the com∣modore home with him to his own house for the night. The company made themselves very merry at his expense, but as he knew nothing beyond sea terms, so he took no notice of them, and next day being properly equipped, he re∣turned to the castle, where he found his old friend Lieutenant Hatchway. Next morning the wind happened to prove favorable, and left he should once more get on the devil's back, he resolved to walk to the church on foot. Ac∣cordingly having dispatched Tom Pipes to in∣form his bride, the lady met him at the church, and the nuptial knot was tied. A grand enter∣tainment was provided at the castle, but when the time came for the company to retire, an un∣lucky circumstance happened, which was no oth∣er than the want of a bed for the new married couple. The commodore was so much of a sea∣man, that he obliged every one in the castle to lay
<PB N="8" REF="034563_0005_0FFE2BA38286DDA8"/>
in hammocks, which were slung up in the same manner as in ships.</P>
<P>The lady remonstrated in the strongest manner against lying in such an indecent posture, but by the persuasion of her brother and sister in law, she was induced to comply, and, being undressed, mounted the hammock to wait the arrival of her spouse. Every thing being properly adjusted for the reception of the commodore, he came into the room, or rather the cabin, where having drank a can of flip, and received three cheers, he got into the canvass vehicle, to the no small terror of his lady, who imagined every moment that she would tumble out at the other side The company be∣ing now retired, the new married couple went to rest, but no sooner did morning arrive than the lady got up and dispatched one of the servants to a neighboring town to purchase a genteel bedstead, being now determined to assert her prerogative as a wife, and not be any longer subject to the whims and caprice of her husband.</P>
<P>When the commodore saw the bed, he swore, cursed and blasphemed, declaring that it should be immediately consigned to the flames, but by the interposition of Hatchway and Mr. Pickle, he was brought into a more reasonable way of thinking, and to oblige his spouse, consented to lie in it, tho contrary to a resolution he had form∣ed many years before. The lady proceeded to make several other alterations in the castle, by turning off some of the old servants, and ordering
<PB N="9" REF="034563_0005_0FFE2BA38286DDA8"/>
that the guns should not be fired but in her ab∣sence, lest they should frighten her so much as to occasion an abortion. All these acts of a new reformation the commodore was obliged to com∣ply with, and to console himself under what he considered as real afflictions, he spent more of his time than usual at the alehouse, cursing the day that ever he had weghed anchor for the port of matrimony.</P>
<P>The haughty domineering temper of the com∣modore's lady, made her odious to every one in the castle, but as her husband was made to be∣lieve that she was pregnant, so he bore with it for some time. At last, all hopes of an heir be∣ing vanished, the lady took to the bottle and re∣ligion for consolation, and the commodore resol∣ved to make young Peregrine his heir. Pere∣grine had been sometime at a boarding school, where he had played abundance of little knavish tricks, which were winked at by the usher, who frequently received a gratuity from the commo∣dore. But the usher, going away, Peregrine wrote a letter to the commodore, who was so much pleased with it, that he went to his father, and desired he would suffer him to be brought up under his own direction.</P>
<P>By this time Mr. Pickle, who had another son <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well as a daughter, looked on the proposal as too valuable to be rejected, so that he instantly complied with it, especially as for reasons un∣known, the mother had conceived the utmost
<PB N="10" REF="034563_0006_0FFE2BA517780A98"/>
aversion for her eldest son. In consequence of this permission, Hatchway was dispatched the same day in a post chaise to the school, and brought young Peregrine home, who was now in his eleventh year, and began to display so much genius, that every one was charmed with him. His aunt the lady of the commodore, was so much inured to dram drinking, that when Per∣egrine was presented to her, she seemed to take no notice of him, but thro the persuasion of Hatch∣way she came down into the parlor, and received him with seeming marks of respect. Next day the commodore took him to visit his parents, but how great was his surprise, when he found that his mother declared that he was not her son, for that he had died when only a child. This, however, made no other impression on the com∣modore, besides that of making him love the boy more than ever, and therefore he took him along with him to the castle, resolving to bestow that parental care and tenderness upon him which his mother had denied him, altho she knew it was her duty.</P>
<P>Tom Pipes, who all his life time had been accustomed to the practice of mischievious tricks, became, as it were by sympathy, the favorite of young Peregrine, who had one of the most fer∣tile geniusses that ever fell to the share of one of his age. As the commodore's lady often retired to her closet in the evening, under pretence of devotion, but in reality to indulge herself with
<PB N="11" REF="034563_0006_0FFE2BA517780A98"/>
her favorite liquors, so our young spark, with the assistance of the artful Tom Pipes, resolved to torment her with the fear of hell and the devil. Sometimes they would climb up to the window of her closet at midnight, and imitate the scream∣ing of an owl, or some other frightful creature, which operated so strongly upon her distempered imagination, that she began to think the grand adversary of mankind had come to take her away before her time.</P>
<P>But the bent of their mischievous inclinations was not confined to the lady, for they actually di∣rected it against the commodore himself. The commodore had the utmost aversion to attornies ever since a knavish one had tricked him in a law∣suit, and therefore our adventurers resolved to try his patience on that head, or rather to torment him, as if they had been devils incarnate. Ac∣cordingly, they forged a letter to a country at∣torney, in the name of the commodore, desiring him to call next day.</P>
<P>The attorney, who doubted not but he would be able to fleece the old commodore of some hun∣dreds, came to the castle at the hour of dinner, and Tom Pipes going up stairs, desired his com∣mander to come down to the parlor, to speak to a gentleman who waited for him. This put the commodore into a most violent passion, because he was disturbed in the middle of his mess, but recollecting what Pipes said of the business be∣ing urgent, he went down, and demanded what
<PB N="12" REF="034563_0007_0FFE2BA6F8082D60"/>
the gentleman wanted with him. The attorney told him that he came according to an order he received from him, and the sooner the business was dispached the better. "True, said the com∣modore, mad with indignation," and lifting up his stick, gave him such a blow that he fell flat on the ground. He then hopped up to his chamber to finish his dinner, congrattulaing him∣self that he had knocked out the brains of a roguish lawyer.</P>
<P>As soon as the attorney had recovered him∣self, so as to be able to get up, he looked about him, to see whether he could not procure evidence to support an action on the case for an assault, but seeing none, he crawled up to the dining room, where the commodore was finishing his mess, and told him that if there was any law in England, he would punish him to the utmost rigour of it. He then produced the forged let∣ter, which had been sent in the name of the com∣modore, but no sooner had the old man read it, than he ordered the attorney to be tossed in a blanket in the castle-yard. Hatchway and Pipes performed the operation with so much dexteri∣ty, that the skin of the limb of the law, was as disfigured as any sheet of parchment that ever issued from his office. The attorney having received this wholesome discipline, was then ducked in a horsepond, and was left to pursue his journey home in the best manner he could. Stimulated with motives of revenge, he brought
<PB N="13" REF="034563_0007_0FFE2BA6F8082D60"/>
his action for damages against the commodore, and the affair was tried at the next assizes. Sev∣eral witnesses were examined, but as ill luck would have it, not one could prove a single cir∣cumstance, so that the attorney was non-suited, to the no small pleasure of many persons present, whom he had by his pernicious advice, led into vexatious law-suits, and actually ruined, under pretence of promoting their interest.</P>
<P>Their next exploit was much more diverting, and conducted by the very ingenious Tom Pipes. The hide of a large ox was made choice of, and being properly stuffed, the jaw bone of a shark was fixed to his face, with two large glass eyes. Within were several matches burning, which gave the whole the most dreadful appearance, and this was fixed near the bedchamber of the commodore. No sooner did the commodore see the dreadful apparition spewing out blue fire, than he imagined himself in hell, for few people in the world are more superstious than seamen. His courage, however, did not forsake him, for lifting up his stick, he struck it such a blow, that one of the horns was almost fractured. He then took to his heels, but could not run long, when he sunk down with fear; for he believed the artifi∣cial apparition to be the devil. Tom Pipes, who beheld the whole, was not willing to lose any part of the diversion, and therefore just as the commodore was beginning to saint, he ran to∣wards
<PB N="14" REF="034563_0008_0FFE2BAB6F2C7A20"/>
him and tripped up his heels. The com∣modore being in some measure recovered by his fears rather than the hope of delivery, called out in the most vociferous manner, upon which the servants came to his assistance. They found him in a cold sweat, for fear had in paired both his senses and faculties, so that he was little better than a dead man. Hatchway endeavored to raise him up, and enquiring into the cause of his misfortune, was told by the commodore, that he had met Davy Jones (the name given by the sailors to the devil) and that he knew him by his saucer eyes. It is very remarkable, that of all injuries, those that we receive in youth make the most lasting impression, especially when they are accompanied with circumstances of an ag∣gravating nature. It seems that while the com∣modore was only a school boy, he had been de∣tected in stealing deer, and being carried before a neighboring justice, his worship used him in so cruel a manner, that he was obliged to content himself with a place in the county goal. There he remained near a year, and his relations refu∣sing to do any thing for him, he was obliged to embrace the alternative, either to remain in pris∣on, or go on board of a ship. He chose the lat∣ter, and having undergone all those hardships that are connected with naval affairs, he conceiv∣ed the utmost aversion to all those related to him, and refused to have any connection with them for the future.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="034563_0008_0FFE2BAB6F2C7A20"/>
Peregrine, who was acquainted with every particular of this affair, told Hatchway and Pipes that he would have a notable piece of fun at his uncle's expense. The proposal was relished by the two confederates, and it was agreed up∣on between them, that a proper person would be made choice of to come to the commodore with a forged letter, in the name of that relation, who of all the others, had used him with the greatest cruelty. The person made choice of for this purpose, was the exciseman of the parish: and having received directions, he went one morning to the commodore, about <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hours before the usual time of his getting up <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The commodore swore he would not come down till the usual time of turning out, but the exciseman having told the servant that his business was of the most urgent nature, he resolved to comply.</P>
<P>Having crept out of his bed, he made shift to crawl down stairs, grumbling and cursing all the way for being disturbed of his rest. When he came into the parlor, the supposed rela∣tion addressed himself to him in all the fulsome flattery that has an affect on weak minds; but the commodore, who did not relish any thing of that nature, desired him to give over his com∣pliments, and come to the point at once.</P>
<P>Upon that the stranger presented him a letter, written, as he said, by that uncle who had used him with so much cruelty while he was in prison, for stealing the deer; and to add the more to
<PB N="16" REF="034563_0009_0FFE2BB132FFF438"/>
the aggravation that it must necessarily occasion, he told him that he had been to him one of the kindest relations that ever lived.</P>
<P>It is impossible to discribe the perturbation of mind which the commodore felt, when he read the letter, and at last losing all manner of pa∣tience, he tore it into a thousand pieces, and trod upon the fragments on the floor. He cursed all his relations to the lowest pit of hell, and declar∣ed that he would not give one farthing, or the value of a rope's end, to keep them above board.</P>
<P>The exciseman who was no stranger to the character of the commodore, began to consider himself in perilous circumstances, and therefore walked towards the door, in order to procure a retreat, not doubting but he would be able to make the commodore hearken to the voice of reason. He then told the commodore that he was one of the most ungrateful wretches in the world, for using his own relations in so shame∣ful a manner, and concluded, by asking him what he thought they would say of such un∣natural behavior.</P>
<P>The commodore could conceal his resentment no longer, and turning to Tom Pipes, ordered him to take his supposed relation to the gang way, and there give him a round dozen doubled. Tom, tho an accomplice in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whole of the scheme, yet obeyed his orders with dexterity and punctuality. He called on some of the servants
<PB N="17" REF="034563_0009_0FFE2BB132FFF438"/>
to assist him, who readily obeyed, and the poor gauger was conducted over the draw bridge to the yard, where he was tied to a stake, in order to undergo proper discipline. He still imagined that Tom Pipes was in jest, but that arch-rogue who was not too fond of what we call moral obligations, having tied him so fast, that he could not well make his escape, went in search of a rope for the intended operation. When he ar∣rived, the exciseman told him that he hoped he was not in earnest, to which Tom answered, he was very sorry for the part he was to act, but as his master's orders were absolute he was obliged to comply with them. He then undressed the poor exciseman, and gave him such a hearty flogging, that he cursed the day he had ever been engaged in such an undertaking, threatning at the same time to reveal the whole scheme to the commodore. From doing that, however, he was prevented by Lieutenant Hatchway, who told him that if he made the affair public, he would be found guilty of perjury, for he had personated the name of a man with whom he was utterly unacquainted. This served to si∣lence the exciseman, who as soon as he was loosed from the post, took to his heels with the utmost expedition, and ran home to his wife, who waited for him with the utmost impatience.</P>
<P>It cannot be supposed that such a species of fraud and mischief, should be long carried on
<PB N="18" REF="034563_0010_0FFE2BB2CA8924C0"/>
without detection, and the commodore having revolved all the circumstances in his mind, charged young Perrigrine with it. At first the boy denied the whole, but when he had received a severe flogging, he made an ample confession, which so much exasperated the commodore, that he resolved to turn Hatchway out of the castle. But he had been so long accustomed to the so∣ciety of the lieutenant, as well as Pipes, that he could not live without them, so that they were both freely forgiven.</P>
<P>In the mean time young Peregrine made such progress in learning, that it was proposed to send him to some public school, and that of Winches∣ter was made choice of by his tutor, and approv∣ed of by the commodore. Indeed the com∣modore's lady had several reasons for wish∣ing to get rid of our adventurer; for, besides his many knavish pranks, she considered him as a spy on her conduct. Mr. Jolter, a reverend clergyman, of very high notions, was made choice of and recommended by the parson of the parish to be tutor to young Peregrine. Jolter was not a bad scholar, but he had lived so long in a college, that his temper was sour∣ed, so that no person could have been made choice of more improper for superintending the education of a young gentleman. Tom Pipes, who had been long accustomed to jacket and trowsers; was put into a suit of decent livery, in order to attend our adventurer and parson
<PB N="19" REF="034563_0010_0FFE2BB2CA8924C0"/>
Jolter as a footman. The commodore pro∣posed, that they should set out to take leave of the young gentleman's father, but the mother refused to see him, so unnatural was she to her child, for reasons that no one could account for. The commodore, however, made up all that was wanting in the affections of the par∣ents, for he adopted young Peregrine as his heir, and settled him at Winchester on the most genteel footing. The commodore's lady made a handsome present to Mr. Jolter, as a reward for his piety, and Hatchway insisted on staying at the school along with Peregrine. He told the commodore, that he had some thoughts of learning the latin lingo, altho he did not at that time know the difference between a noun and a verb. The commodore expostulated with the lieutenant on the impropriety of thinking to learn latin at such a period of life, and as he could not bear the thought of living without him, he told him, that if he would re∣turn to the castle, he would give him leave to visit young Peregrine once every month. Hatch∣way was not such a fool, but he could feel the force of what was said by the commodore, and therefore having given up all thoughts of learn∣ing Latin, he took leave of our young gentle∣man, tho not without shedding tears. He said he was sure the young dog had bewitched him, for he could not look at him without lov∣ing him. Indeed there was such an honest sim∣plicity
<PB N="20" REF="034563_0011_0FFE2BB4CA59E700"/>
in the lieutenant, that he thought well of all human raoe, and could not help loving such as were young.</P>
<P>Peregrine had not been long at the school, when his genius began to distinguish itself in a most conspicuous manner. His pupil was such an arrant pedant, that he seemed a very proper object for him to exercise his ingenuity upon, and therefore be began by mixing brandy and other strong liquors with his tea, so that he was often intoxicated without knowing the cause. By such practices he brought the character of his tutor into the utmost contempt, and to complete the farce, Peregrine was chosen <HI>Dux</HI> or head of a select number of boys, who re∣solved to shake off all obedience to their tutors. The head master having received information of the proceedings, sent for Mr. Jolter, and told him that he must keep a more strict watch over the morals of his pupil, otherwise he would corrupt one half of the boys in the school.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter was a good deal discomposed when he received the information, but as nothing could be more just or reasonable, he went home, and called Peregrine into his room. He repeated to him the dangerous consequences of such practices, and the disgrace he would bring upon himself and relations, unless there was some change in his conduct.</P>
<P>Peregrine, though a wild youth, was not desti∣tute of good sense, and therefore seeing the pro∣priety
<PB N="21" REF="034563_0011_0FFE2BB4CA59E700"/>
of what was said by his tutor, he promis∣ed to be more obedient for the future.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter was so overjoyed at this instance of his pulpil's docility, that he resolved to improve it to the best advantage, and therefore proposed to him the study of the mathematicks, as the only science that can enlarge the mind, by lead∣ing it off from objects of a trifling nature. The young gentleman entered upon the study with the utmost pleasure, but no sooner had gone through the first two books of Euclid than he became so much disgusted with the whole science, that he declared he would not pursue it any further. In vain did Mr. Jolter remonstrate to his pupil on the great impropriety of his con∣duct; the young gentleman remained inexorable, and nothing could induce him to proceed any further. Indeed he shook off all manner of re∣restraint, he refused to be obedient to his tutor any longer, upon which the head master desired Mr. Jolter to write to the commodore, that he might as soon as possible remove Tom Pipes from attending on Peregrine, for that antiquated seaman was now become a general nuisance to the whole school.</P>
<P>The truth is, Tom Pipes was at the head of every scene of mischief, and nothing seemed to give him so much pleasure, as that of tor∣menting his fellow creatures. He mingled in all their divirsions, and decided in every contro∣versy that arose between them. He regulated
<PB N="22" REF="034563_0012_0FFE2BB7D62D5E40"/>
their manual exercise by his whistle, and he pre∣scribed rules to each of them according to their different ages. Indeed Tom Pipes was in a man∣ner become so necessary to the boys, that it could be supposed that they would part with him with∣out an insurrection taking place. Peregrine was sensible of this, and therefore on promising to be more circumspect, in the rest of his conduct, Pipes was allowed to continue at the school some∣time longer. This, however, was a resolution too good to last long, as will appear from the following incident.</P>
<P>One day Tom Pipes having conducted some of the boys to a garden in the suburbs they were very rude in pulling the fruit, which so enraged the gardner, that he came to them and demand∣ed satisfaction. The boys refused to satisfy his demands, upon which the great dog was let loose upon them, and in the scuffle Peregrine lost his cap. The engagement now became general, the gardner called his apprentice to his assistance, while Tom Pipes led on the insurgents in battle array. The gardner, who was a stout fellow, took his stand at the turning of one of the aven∣ues, and when Pipes advanced, he gave him such a blow on the head, that his scull rung if it had been made of bell metal.</P>
<P>Pipes soon recovered from the dreadful blow he had received, and darting his head into the bosom of the gardner tumbled him into a trench, that he had newly digged, nor did it fare better

with the dog who coming up to the assistance of his master, laid hold of the calf of Tom Pipes' leg, and would have eaten it for his dinner, had not the seamen turned about, and in an instant put a period to the existence of the voracious an∣imal.</P>
<P>The gardner was now so much overpowered that he knew not what to do, and his wise hav∣ing alarmed the neighborhood. Tom Pipes ad∣vised the scholars to desist, left they should be all apprehended and committed to prison. The scholars complied with his request, but as the gardner was rendered incapable of following his work, and as his children became chargeable to the parish, an enquiry was set on scot to find out the aggressors.</P>
<P>The result of the enquiry was, that out ad∣venturer was found to be at the head of this un∣ruly mob of boys, and therefore it was ordered that he should undergo a severe slugging, and a day was appointed for the execution of this solemn decree.</P>
<P>The thoughts of being disgraced in this manner was what he could not bear, and there∣fore, he resolved to make an elopement from the school. He communicated his intentions to some of the most active of the scholars, and when the time arrived that he was to receive the threatened discipline, they came with him into the school, and demanded of the master that he should instantly be forgiven. The master,
<PB N="24" REF="034563_0013_0FFE2BBD95375DB0"/>
however, behaved with that dignity becoming his station, and Peregrine, notwithstanding his professions of courage, was horsed and whipped, to the terror of all others, who should for the fu∣ture offend in the like manner, this disgrace had such an effect upon him, that he resolved to de∣tach himself from his disorderly companions, and apply himself in good earnest to his stud∣ies. He was now above fourteen years of age, &amp; in stature and shape one of the finest figures that ever was seen. The young ladies began to take notice of him, and there being a ball one even∣ing he went to dance at it, as is the practice with young gentlemen.</P>
<P>While he was waiting for the company, the master of the ceremonies took notice of him, and singled out for him a partner, a young lady whose name was Emilia Gauntlet, and sister to a young gentleman who happened to be there at the same time. The young lady was extremely handsome, and her exterior appearance was set off by all the improvements that the intellectual faculties can receive. When the ball was over our hero returned to his lodgings, but he could not sleep during the whole of the night. In the morning he arose, and having dressed himself in the most agreeable manner, he went to the lodg∣ings of Miss Gauntlet, and was shown into the parlor. Emilia made her appearance in the most enchanting dress; and the passions of our hero were now wound up to the highest pitch. The
<PB N="25" REF="034563_0013_0FFE2BBD95375DB0"/>
mother of the young lady was still in bed, and when she got up she seemed to look upon Pere∣grine in no very favorable light, for she consider∣ed him in no other light than a young spark who wanted to make himself merry at the expense of such young females as are weak enough to heark∣en to their solicitations.</P>
<P>The young lady treated him with all the in∣dulgence she possibly could, consistent with the regard she ought to have had for her own char∣acter, and invited him to visit her from time to time at her mother's house, which was only a few miles distant. This was just what he wished for, and in the midst of his mutual embraces, he declared to her, that his passion was the most pure that ever took place in the human breast. Being obliged to take leave of his charmer, he re∣turned to school, but became so pensive and mel∣ancholy, that all his former acquaintance began to shun his company. At last he resolved to elope, and having tied up a bundle of linen, with other necessaries, he gave it to Tom Pipes, and next morning they both set out together on foot, for the village where the mother of Emilia lived.</P>
<P>When he came to the village, he took lodg∣ings at an inn, and leaving Tom Pipes to take care of his baggage, he set out for the house where his charmer resided, struggling under all that anxiety of mind that generally takes place in the breast of a lover.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="034563_0014_0FFE2BBF215F2AC8"/>
When he came to the gate, he was so much taken up with the thoughts of the young lady, that when she made her appearance he scarce knew her; for his mind was tortured with all the variety of discordant passion. She received him in the most complaisant manner, and con∣ducted him to the parlor, where her mother was then sitting drinking tea. This was a more fa∣vorable reception than he had any reason to ex∣pect; but every thing succeeding so far accord∣ing to his wish, it was proposed that he and the young lady should take a walk together till tow∣ards evening. Upon their return the mother invited Peregrine to supper, and the young lov∣ers being left alone, many tender things passed between them. He protested in the most sol∣emn manner that he loved her above every one he had ever seen; while she on her part chid him gently for running away from school. In this she was seconded by her mother, whose circum∣stances had taught her prudence; for she was the widow of a general officer who had lost his life in the service of his country, and had left his son in the humble station of a volunteer, wait∣ing for the interest of some great man to bestow upon him a commission.</P>
<P>While he remained under the influence of this sweet intoxication, his absence occasioned no small disturbance at Winchester, and Mr. Jolter wrote to the commodore, giving him an account of his elopement. The poor old commodore re∣ceived
<PB N="27" REF="034563_0014_0FFE2BBF215F2AC8"/>
the news of the elopement with the utmost surprise, and cursed Hatchway and Tom Pipes, for having debauched the boy's mind, by leading him off from a sense of his duty. Nor did he spare Jolter, whom he called an old doating fool, because he did not keep a better look out, to prevent Peregrine from foundering. He im∣mediately dispatched expresses to all the sea-ports on the coast, to prevent his going abroad, while Lieutenant Hatchway was dispatched across the country, to make all the enquiries he could con∣cerning the young fugitive. Hatchway spent four days without receiving any intelligence, when being benighted, he took up his lodgings at a village, where he had not regaled himself long, when he heard the voice of his old friend Tom Pipes, entertaining a company of rustics with a song in true sea language. Hatchway flung his pipe into the chimney corner, and grasping a pistol in his hand, went to the room where Pipes was, and swore that he would blow his brains out, unless he produced young Pere∣grine. Pipes, not in the least intimidated, told the lieutenant, that Peregrine was as safe as a roach, and that he would produce him as soon as he had finished his song. Hatchway could not have any objection to this proposal, and Tom having finished his song, and dismissed the com∣pany, the two old mess mates retired to another room. There Pipes recited to the lieutenant every circumstance relating to the elopement,
<PB N="28" REF="034563_0015_0FFE2BC0EF9198D8"/>
and before they had done speaking, Peregrine came in from his mistress with whom he had spent the evening. Hatchway was overjoyed to see his long lost young master, but much more so, when he found that he was sensible of his folly in running away from school, and vexing his generous friend the commodore. At last, it was agreed that they should set out the next morning for Winchester, and in the mean time Peregrine went to take leave of his mistress. Their parting was truly affecting, but as there was necessity for it, the young lady pretended to make no objections, while her mother said all she could in favor of parental authority, and next morning our hero returned to Winchester, where he was received in the most kindly manner, by Parson Jolter his tutor.</P>
<P>The master of the school forgave him on ac∣count of his youth, but when Hatchway returned to the garrison, and told the whole of the cir∣cumstances to the commodore, the old gentle∣man was very much grieved, especially when he began to consider that there was a young lady in the case. He resolved therefore to lay the whole of the affair before Mr. Pickle, his father, that proper measures might be concerted, in or∣der to prevent his ruin. In the mean time, Peregrine sent a love epistle to his mistress, and concluded, by telling her, that he would never place his affections on any other object. This letter was sent by the hands of the faithful Tom
<PB N="29" REF="034563_0015_0FFE2BC0EF9198D8"/>
Pipes, with strict orders that it should be delivered into her own hands, without communicating the contents to any person whatever besides herself.</P>
<P>Tom Pipes being thus employed as ambassa∣dor, took his place on the box of a stage coach, and that the letter might not be lost, he put it be∣tween the sole of his shoe and stocking. This was very consistent with his own vulgar ideas, but no sooner did he come to the inn, than feel∣ing for the letter, he found that by the motion of the coach, it was all torn in pieces. This was a most shocking circumstance for poor Tom Pipes, who cursed both the coachman and the coach. There was, however, no time to be lost, and, therefore, after some reflection, he resolved to send for the clerk of the parish, and get him to write a letter of a similar nature.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Tom went in quest of the school∣master, who was one of the most arrant pedants that ever lived, and bringing him to the inn, got him to write a letter in that stile which those of his fraternity call the true sublime. Pipes was so much overjoyed when he heard it read, that he could not refrain from squeezing the peda∣gogue by the hand, telling him at the same time, that it was light in its timbers, and would forev∣er remain above water. Flushed with the hopes of success, he set out for the house where the young lady resided, not doubting but he would meet with a favorable reception, but when she had read the nonsensical epistle, she concluded
<PB N="30" REF="034563_0016_0FFE2BC2AE620600"/>
that either her lover was mad, or that he had sent the letter with no other view, than to make her an object of ridicule.</P>
<P>Pipes, who doubted not but he would receive a favorable answer, was dismissed with visible marks of contempt, and next day he arrived at Winchester. Peregrine, who had waited for his return with the utmost impatience, no sooner saw him, than he reached out his hand for a let∣ter, but being informed that he had none, he im∣mediately concluded, that Emilia had not an op∣portunity to write, and therefore he resolved to wait the return of the post. But as he did not receive any answer during the whole of the en∣suing week, his pride was summoned up to his assistance, and he began to despise the woman whom he imagined had treated him with so much indignity.</P>
<P>His behavior soon reached the ears of the young lady's mother, and from that circum∣stance she was convinced that he was the same coxcomb as he had represented himself in his letter. She therefore ordered her daughter not to think any more of him▪ and thus a youthful correspon∣dence was broken off merely by the conduct of Pipes, who took no more notice of it than if he had been assisting in pumping a ship, or prevent∣ing one from destruction.</P>
<P>While things were going on in this manner, the commodore, who never lost sight of the in∣terest of young Peregrine, consulted the parson
<PB N="31" REF="034563_0016_0FFE2BC2AE620600"/>
of the parish concerning the most proper means to be used, and at last it was agreed upon between them, that he should be taken from the school, and sent to the university. Accordingly he was sent for home along with his tutor, Mr. Jolter, who had not, during the whole time he was at Winchester, taught him any thing that could contribute towards promoting his interest. Mr. Pickle no sooner saw his son, than he be∣stowed a thousand blessings on the commo∣dore, for having been at so much expence in his education, but his mother was of a different opinion, for she had conceived such an inveterate hatred to her eldest son, that she loked upon him as an object of detestation. She ordered that none of the servants should for the future grant him admittance to the house, which so much ex∣asperated Hatchway, that he swore he would be revenged on her one way or other. Indeed, it is not to be wondered at, for the honest lieuten∣ant imagined that every one was as innocent as himself.</P>
<P>The commodore, who under an outside of savage rusticity, possessed real goodness of heart, could not hear with indifference the manner in which Mr. Pickle used his son, and therefore having bestowed a volley of curses upon the whole family, he took Peregrine home along with him to the castle. It was then resolved, that our young adventurer should be sent to the uni∣versity along with Mr. Jolter, who was still to act
<PB N="32" REF="034563_0017_0FFE2BC5A9188200"/>
the part of his tutor; but he had not been long at Oxford, when he discovered such a disposition for satire, that every one of the young nobility and gentry courted his frendship, not doubting but they would be able to make his ingenuity subservient to their purposes. Mr. Jolter, who had the interest of Peregrine entirely at heart, in order to divert him from such practices, in∣troduced him to the company of a club of poli∣ticians, who were reputed men of knowledge and probity, and who spent the evenings in animad∣verting on the conduct of the ministry, and hatch∣ing schemes for overturning the government both in church and state.</P>
<P>It is not to be supposed that a youth so vola∣tile as Peregrine, would be much delighted with the company of men, who instead of speaking consistant with their characters as rational crea∣tures, were like an assembly of quakers, or rather of superannuated or melancholy cats. Indeed, he looked upon them in so mean and contemptible a light, that he soon began to despise them, and one night having made them all drunk, he start∣ed a topic of argument that irritated their pas∣sions so much that they got to loggerheads, bottles and glasses, which slew about in such abundance, that scarce one in the company could make his escape without receving a mark that would put him in mind of the nocturnal adventure.</P>
<P>The uproar was so great that the whole neighborhood was alarmed, and just at that in∣stant,
<PB N="33" REF="034563_0017_0FFE2BC5A9188200"/>
the proctor happening to be returning to his chamber, took them all into custody, except Mr. Jolter, who made his escape at the ex∣pence of a couple of black eyes. Next morning he was summoned to attend the proctor, in order to answer for his conduct, which frightened him considerably, but Peregrine, who was an arch wag, told him that he would, by the help of a cer∣tain paint, hide the circles around his eyes, to which Jolter submitted, but when he made his appearance, the fraud was discovered, and he re∣ceived a severe reprimand.</P>
<P>For some time Parson Jolter was so much mor∣tified, that he scarce knew how to appear in pub∣lic, and not doubting but Peregrine had a princi∣pal share in the whole scheme, he could not re∣frain from showing marks of his resentment. This was what the proud spirit of our adventurer could not bear, and therefore in revenge for the insolence of his tutor, he wrote a copy of verses against him, in such satirical language, that poor Jolter hesitated, whether he should not lay out his last shilling, in the purchase of a rope, in or∣der to deprive the hangman of his <HI>legal</HI> wages.</P>
<P>Peregrine often used to make excursions to dif∣ferent parts of the country, particularly Windsor, where while he was one day walking along with a fellow collegian, he discovered Emilia, and made up to her. The young lady had not for∣gotton the insult offered her in the odious letter, written by the parish clerk, at the instigation of
<PB N="34" REF="034563_0018_0FFE2BCBD0999A70"/>
Tom Pipes, and therefore she treated him in a cold formal manner. She refused to hear any thing that he had to say in his defence; but after several solicitations, she agreed to honor him with an interview, during which time the whole mystery was cleared up, and a mutual reconcili∣ation took place, though not before the amiable young lady procured a free pardon for poor Pipes and the pedantic clerk. In the mean time, his long absence from Oxford, gave great uneasi∣ness to Mr. Jolter, who with all his faults, still wished his pulpil well, and therefore having learn∣ed the name of the young gentleman with whom he had made the excursion to Windsor, he went to his chambers, and was told that Peregrine was still at Winsor along with Miss Emilia Gauntlet, and that it would be no easy matter to disengage them from each other.</P>
<P>In consequence of that information, Mr. Jol∣ter set out for Winsor, where he met with his pulpil, and remonstrated to him on the impro∣priety of his conduct. This put Peregrine into a most violent passion, and high words arose be¦tween him and his tutor. Mr. Jolter could ne∣ver forgive Peregrine for the part he had acted, in making him so ridiculous at the political club; and, although he was under many obligations to the commodore, yet he would have given up his charge, had he not been in expectation of re∣ceiving a rich living, which the aged naval officer was expected to have in his power, to present
<PB N="35" REF="034563_0018_0FFE2BCBD0999A70"/>
him to, after the death of an incumbent, who was then far advanced in years. The thoughts of such a valuable acquisition made him keep his passions under proper restraint, and although often insulted by Peregrine, yet he resolved to dissemble his resentment, till such time as he was properly provided for.</P>
<P>Peregrine was so much exasperated at the conduct of his tutor, that he wrote a letter to his aunt, and in answer received one which mortified his pride to the utmost. She told him, that the commodore had all along treat∣ed him with the greatest tenderness, and that it was his duty to be obedient to him in every thing, but this so far from bringing his pas∣sions under the government of reason, only serv∣ed to inflame them the more, and therefore be wrote a letter in the most polite stile to the commodore, attempting to ridicule his conduct by throwing the whole blame upon Jolter, whom he accused of tyrrany and partiality.</P>
<P>The commodore, who knew no other phrases than such as were made use of at sea, wrote Peregrine an answer, wherein he told him, that if he would be a good boy, he would take him into favor, but if he continued refractory, he would discard him forever.</P>
<P>Hatchway, who had been dispatched with this letter to Peregrine, said all he could to persuade the young gentleman to comply with the com∣modore's request, and in order to prevail with
<PB N="36" REF="034563_0019_0FFE2BCDD2A50A70"/>
him, told him, that if he had seduced the young lady, he was willing to take her off his hands. Hatchway had strict orders to bring our young hero home to the castle, but no sooner had he mentioned the affair to him, than Peregrine start∣ed up, and declared his resolution that no person should compel him to comply with a proposal so contrary to his inclination. Hatchway was so much irritated at what Peregrine said, that he tripped up his heels, and laid him flat on the floor, calling him at the same time one of the most saucy boys that ever walked between stem and stern. Peregrine would have dropped all man∣ner of altercation with one whom he loved for the honest simplicity of his manners, but noth∣ing would serve the lieutenant, unless, he would fight him with sword and pistols. The place made choice of for the deciding this impor∣tant quarrel, was Windsor forest, to which our two combatants walked, but in their way thith∣er, they were met by Tom Pipes, who armed himself with a large wooden cudgel. As Pipes had the utmost respect for the lieutenant, with whom he had served many years on board, and as he really wished well to young Pere∣grine, so he resolved to prevent any mischief that should happen, and in consequence of that resolution, brought both parties to agree to∣gether, and the commodore wrote a very feeling letter to Peregrine, promising him that nothing
<PB N="37" REF="034563_0019_0FFE2BCDD2A50A70"/>
should be wanting to promote his interest for the future.</P>
<P>When Peregrine had viewed the commo∣dore's letter, he was so much chagrined, that he became for some weeks a perfect slave to melancholy, but the impetuosity of his passions getting the better of every thing, he resolved to assert his dignity as a rational creature, and not to be any longer the dupe of a family, who seem∣ed to seek the promotion of his interest no far∣ther than was consistant with their own inclina∣tions. Stimulated by motives of resentment against Hatchway, and still a captive to love, he went to visit his charmer, not doubting but her conversation would contribute towards sub∣bing off that rusticity that he had con∣tracted during the melancholy under which he had labored. He told her that his uncle the commodore had proposed that he should make the tour of Europe, and he could not help expa∣tiating on the pleasures that he would enjoy in the volatile court of Paris, where nothing less than intrigue and gallantry could make a distinguish∣ing figure.</P>
<P>The young lady heard him with emotion, nor was it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her power to prevent the tears from dropping down from her lovely eyes, especially when she was told that the commodore was of∣fended at their meeting so often together. To remove all her scruples, he told her that he would be hers to the latest period of his existence, and
<PB N="38" REF="034563_0020_0FFE2BCFA1490AB8"/>
at the same time endeavored to convince her of the necessity he was under of paying an implicit obedience to his uncle's commands. The young lady could not help feeling in the most sensible manner the force of what he advanced, and there∣fore composing herself, she told him that she was perfectly satisfied, and that for the future she would not object to any part of his conduct, un∣less by some fresh action of his infidelity he should give her occasion to do so. Every thing being thus settled in the most amicable manner, the young lady took her leave, and our hero, who re∣solved to comply with his uncle's request, dis∣patched the lieutenant and parson Jolter to the castle, to inform the commodore, that as soon as he had settled a few trifling things among his fel∣low collegians, he would return, and comply with every thing that he had proposed for him, with respect to the regulation of his future con∣duct particularly, and making the tower of Eu∣rope.</P>
<P>In his journey to the castle he took Emilia along with him part of the way, and on the even∣ing of the first day they took up their lodgings at a country inn, which at that time was crowd∣ed with great numbers of people, who had been at a neighboring fair, and were now regaling themselves with beer and tobacco. This was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> circumstance that our lovers were obliged to put up with: but in the middle of the night they were alarmed with the cry of fire; and, upon inquiry was found that the country people, having <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="39" REF="034563_0020_0FFE2BCFA1490AB8"/>
drunk, had left some candles burning, so that two of the galleries were instantly in a flame. Pere∣grine and Tom Pipes started up in an instant, and saved the young lady as well her compan∣ion; and so disinterested was poor Tom, that he refused to accept of a reward which they ge∣nerously offered him.</P>
<P>Next day they arrived at the house where the young lady's mother lived, but her brother had no sooner seen our hero, than he considered him as one who had a design to injure his sister, and therefore treated him in the most haughty man∣ner. This was more than Peregrine would have bore with from any other person, but the love he had for Emilia induced him to conceal his re∣sentment. The young lady, who could not dis∣semble her passion for him any longer, gave him a ring to keep as a token of her love, which plea∣sed him so much that he embraced her with all the ardour of the most tender affection, and next morning set out on his journey.</P>
<P>He had not however proceeded far on his jour∣ney, when at the end of a lane he was met by Godfrey, the brother of the young lady, and commanded to stop till he had given him the sat∣isfaction of a gentleman. For some time Pere∣grine insulted him on account of his poverty, and told him in plain terms, if he did not go in∣stantly about his business, he would order his footman, Tom Pipes, to give him a most hearty drubbing. This last expression so much exas∣perated Godfrey, that he drew his sword, so that
<PB N="40" REF="034563_0021_0FFE2BD6D6C15CF8"/>
our hero was obliged to do the same, and a furi∣ous combat ensued. Each of the contending par∣ties were wounded, but Peregrine having broken his sword, the other refused to take any advan∣tage of him; but, leaving him, told him, that for the future he must never insult any gentleman on account of his poverty.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who with his foibles had a large share or humanity, no sooner heard the last words uttered by the young gentleman than he was struck with remorse, for having treated him so disrespectfully, and therefore going up to him de∣sired that he would alight from his horse, till he should have an opportunity of explaining his sen∣timents. The young gentleman, who was no more than a cadet in the army, though the son of a general officer, supposed he wanted to finish the combat, and therefore alighting, walked with him into a room, where he expected he would present him with a brace of pistols. But how great was his surprise when Peregrine gave him to understand, that he was willing to do any thing to promote his interest, and that his passion for his sister was the most pure that could be im∣agined. He added that he was going to set out for France, and Godfrey having promised to meet him at the commodore's, they both parted on the most friendly terms.</P>
<P>The commodore was now turned of seventy, and so much crippled by the gout, that he was scarce able to stir abroad. Mr. Pickle, his broth∣er in-law, gave him but very little of his com∣pany,
<PB N="41" REF="034563_0021_0FFE2BD6D6C15CF8"/>
so that the old gentleman was, in a man∣ner, restored to a new state of life, in consequence of having young Peregrine once more to attend him. Gamaliel, the younger brother of Pere∣grine, was now about fifteen years of age, but of such perverse disposition, that altho his mother considered him as her favorite, yet every one in the house, as well as in the neighborhood, treated him with the most sovereign contempt.</P>
<P>One day while young Gamaliel was riding out along with his tutor, the curate of the parish, Peregrine happened to come in sight, and Gam∣aliel who had been taught to offer him all the in∣dignities he could, rode up against him, in or∣der to unhorse him. Peregrine, who guessed his intention, acted in so spirited a manner, that young Gamaliel was flung from his horse, and before he had time to recover himself; Peregrine dismounted, and gave the curate such a hearty drubbing, that he was not able, for several weeks after, to make his appearance in the church, so that he was obliged to say, "Lord have mercy upon us," at home.</P>
<P>Complaints were made to the commodore not the good old seaman, instead of paying any re∣gard to them, declared that he wished young Gamaliel had broke his neck, so as Peregrine was out of the scrape.</P>
<P>As Peregrine could not put up calmy with the affront that had been offered him by the curate, so he resolved to take a severe revenge on that
<PB N="42" REF="034563_0022_0FFE2BD860AD95D8"/>
reverend gentleman. Accordingly he and Hatch∣way set out for the alehouse where the curate spent his evenings, and having engaged a par∣lor for themselves, the lieutenant was placed to keep a good look, while Peregrine, who was an excellent mimic, went into the yard, and person∣ated a dialogue between the curate and the wise of the publican. It was not long before the landlord heard what passed, and concluding that his spouse was gone into the barn with the priest, he ran thither in search of the adulterers, while Peregrine got in at the window, and set down in the most demure manner with Hatchway. As the poor publican was too much agitated to seek for his wife in the barn, he left the door open, and returned to the house, where he saw her go in at another door. His suspicions were now fully confirmed, but much more so when he heard Hatchway in his arch leering manner, tell him that he believed the curate of the parish had some regard for his wife.</P>
<P>A few days after this, in order to carry on the farce somewhat farther, at the expence of the curate, a boy was dispatched to inform that rev∣erend gentleman that the publican's wife was extremely ill, and that she could not bear the thoughts of dying without speaking with him. The curate obeyed the summons; and, in the mean time Peregrine, with Hatchway, went to the place as usual, where they had not been long, when our young hero told the publican, that the parson was just gone in at a private door to the
<PB N="43" REF="034563_0022_0FFE2BD860AD95D8"/>
kitchen. This was more than the publican could bear; and therefore, not doubting but he would meet with the curate at the end of one of the lanes in his return, went into the barn, and arm∣ed himself with a flail. From thence he set out to the place where he expected to meet him, and seeing him come up he extended the flail, which if it had done the execution, there would have been a new place for another poor priest. Ex∣asperated that he had not felled the priest to the ground, the publican once more extended the flail, but a second time missing his aim, he struck himself on the head such a terrible blow, that for some time he staggered in the same manner as he had often seen some of his customers do. In the mean time the curate, who imagined that he had been beset by some robber, grasped his cudgel and took to his heels, but the publican getting up, pursued him, and gave him such a drubbing, that had not some laborers come up to his assistance, he would have inevitably per∣ished.</P>
<P>Hatchway and Peregrine sat waiting in the parlor till the landlord arrived, and seeing the marks of his encounter upon him, they began to make themselves very merry at his expence. He could not conceal from them the manner in which he had treated the curate, whom he called a parish bull, let loose upon the wives of all the honest men in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>He had scarce done speaking, when his wife came in, and told him, that some waggish boy
<PB N="44" REF="034563_0023_0FFE2BDA3243C088"/>
had sent Mr. Sackbut, the parson of the parish, to pray with her. The publican, whose jealousy was now wound up to the highest pitch, could conceal his indignation no longer, and therefore turning to his wife, told her, that he had disa∣bled the parson from praying with her for some time. This was what the publican's wife could not bear, and therefore casting a look of ineffable contempt on her husband, told him that he had no business to sit in company with gentlemen, while the company in the kitchen wanted his at∣tendance. It was in vain for the poor henpeck∣ed husband to make any reply, for knowing the superiority that his wife had over him, he left the room, and went to obey her orders. Next day it was reported throughout the parish, that Mr. Sackbut had been attacked by footpads and al∣most murdered, and an advertisement was affix∣ed to the church door, offering a reward to those who would make a discovery, but no person came to claim it, so that the poor parson was obliged to put up with his drubbing.</P>
<P>It was not long before the curate began to sus∣pect that the whole was a scheme projected by Peregrine, for he knew that the whole country could not produce such two cunning rogues as Hatchway and Mr. Thomas Pipes, under whose direction our young hero acted. He therefore resolved to be revenged on Peregrine, and im∣parted his scheme to young Gam. his pupil, but as good luck would have it, the sister of Pere∣grine, an amiable young lady, overheard the
<PB N="45" REF="034563_0023_0FFE2BDA3243C088"/>
whole of their conversation, and communicated it to a young gentleman, who was in love with her; and who gave, by her direction, an account of it to Peregrine.</P>
<P>To counteract this diabolical scheme, it was proposed that a person should be set to watch in an adjacent field, in order to give them an ac∣count at what time the conspiritors came up. One whole evening was spent in vain, for none of them came up, but on the second the messenger came to the castle, and informed the lieutenant that three men were skulking behind a hedge near the road that led to the public house.</P>
<P>This news was no sooner told, than the com∣pany sallied forth, in order to wreck their ven∣geance on the curate and his pupil, but when they came to the place, they found young Mr. Gauntlet the brother of Emily, exercising his cudgel on a fellow whom he had got down. Pe∣regrine, with the rest of the company, ran to his assistance, and having taken the fellow prisoner, conducted him to the castle along with the young gentleman, who had left his horse at the inn. The prisoner being brought before the commo∣dore, confessed that he had been employed by the curate of the parish, to assassinate Peregrine, upon which he was suffered to go about his business, to the great mortification of Pipes, who wanted to give him a round dozen at the gang way.</P>
<P>The commodore treated young Gauntlet with every mark of respect, and one day, in the course of their conversation together, discovered that
<PB N="46" REF="034563_0024_0FFE2BDBF9003960"/>
he had been formerly acquainted with his father, who at that time was only a lieutenant of mar∣ines, tho an officer of experienced conduct.</P>
<P>Young Gauntlet had such scrupulous notions of honor, that before the commodore could pre∣vail on him to accept of as much money as would purchase a commission, he was obliged to tell him that he was so much indebted to his father, but not knowing what was become of him, had never till then an opportunity of re∣paying it. These things being settled, and French servants hired to attend our young hero in his intended tour, Gauntlet left the castle, and the commodore ordered that Tom Pipes should re∣main at home, because he was ignorant of the French lingo. Before Peregrine set out, he re∣ceived a letter from his sister, informing him that she would meet him at a cottage near her father's house, in order to converse with him on some things of Importance.</P>
<P>He obeyed the summons, and when he came to the place, found his sister, and was surprised to find her possessed of so many accomplishments beyond what he expected. He proposed taking her away from her unnatural parents, but be∣fore he had done speaking, his mother, who had placed spies on her daughter, rushed into the apartment, and would have torn the poor young lady to pieces, had not Peregrine interposed in her defence. The mother was so transported with rage that she seemed like a bedlamite, and when Peregrine began to expostulate with her in
<PB N="47" REF="034563_0024_0FFE2BDBF9003960"/>
favor of his sister, she declared that for the fu∣ture she should never be admitted into her father's house. Peregrine was much troubled in what manner he should dispose of his sister, but find∣ing no other method of providing for her than putting her under the protection of his generous benefactor▪ he took her home to the castle, where she met with a welcome reception from the com∣modore. Old Pickle was obliged to comply with the dictates of his wife, which so enraged the commodore, that he sent him a challenge, but the other had no intention of accepting it. Hatchway however, was extremely unwilling to lose a little fun, and therefore returning to the castle, told the commodore that old Mr. Pickle would meet him.</P>
<P>As the commodore never knew what it was to he afraid to fight, he resolved to go, and in the mean time it was proposed that young Peregrine should personate his father, and mimic his voice. A real farce ensued, and the poor commodore was defeated without knowing that the conquer∣or was his godson.</P>
<P>The time for his departure drawing nigh, Mr. Jolter was made choice of to attend him as a tu∣tor, and having taken leave of his friends at the castle, he set out in a post chaise for Dover. Young Gauntlet went with him to see him safe on board, and before they parted, a plan was set∣tled in what manner they should correspond with each other. When they came to Dover, parson Jolter ordered an elegant supper to be got ready,
<PB N="48" REF="034563_0025_0FFE2BE32BE113F8"/>
and some of the best Burgundy wine, but scarce had they sat down, when they were alarmed with a dreadful uproar in the next room. It happen∣ed that the dispute was between a furious Welch∣man, and a poor Italian quack, who not finding proper encouragement in other countries, had come over to England. The Welchman whose Cambrian blood was all on flame, had got the poor foreigner down, and would certainly have killed him, had not Peregrine and the rest of the company come to his assistance. The Welchman said, the Italian was a conjurer, and young Gauntlet swore that he was a Jesuit, because those Gentlemen never travel without charms and en∣chantments. Peregrine however, was not so very superstitious, but told the foreigner that he was at liberty to proceed on his journey, and that no person would molest him.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, who had now joined the company, and heard the whole affair, declared that he dif∣fered in sentiment from his pupil concerning witchcraft, and supported his opinion by many quotations from scripture, as well as from the writings of some divines in the last century. Young Gauntlet, who had been brought up in the army, corroberated all that was said by Jolt∣er, and told the company that he had seen many apparitions, and was well convinced in his own mind of the reality of witchcraft. To all this the Welcman assented by declaring that the em∣pire of Belzebub was far more extensive than that of Rome, for it had extended to Glamor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anshire,
<PB N="49" REF="034563_0025_0FFE2BE32BE113F8"/>
which the Romans could never con∣quor.</P>
<P>Peregrine did not chuse to enter the list with three such formidable combatants, but contented himself by telling them, that he was convinced in his own mind, that witchcraft was nothing more than a scarecrow, or bug-bear, invented to fright∣on the vulgar; after which they all went to supper together in the most amicable manner. In the course of their conversation, it appeared that the Welchman was the same Mr. Morgan, who makes such a distinguishing figure in the adven∣tures of Roderick Random, and who had been some years settled at Canterbury. It happened, that he had been sent for to wait on a sick person at Dover, and the Italian being there at the same time, a most violent dispute arose concerning the nature of the medicines that should be adminis∣tered to the patient.</P>
<P>The empiric prescribed specific medicienes, which the patient accepted of, so that poor Mor∣gan was dismissed without his fee. This exas∣perated him so much, that he swore revenge a∣gainst the Italian and not being properly quali∣fied, or rather not having a sufficient share of pa∣tience to reason coolly, he called the Italian a ne∣cromancer because his medicines had the desired effect. That every thing might be made agree∣able to Morgan, who was really an honest fellow, Peregrine made him a present of as much money as he could have expected from the patient, and
<PB N="50" REF="034563_0026_0FFE2BE4AD71B678"/>
for that night the company seperated, in order to retire to their several appartments. In the morn∣ing, when they got up, they went to visit the castle, with every other curiosity that was to be seen at Dover, after which they breakfasted to∣gether, waiting till the packet should be ready to fall. Morgan declared that he would not leave our hero till he saw him safe on board, and he was as good as his word for he kept standing on the shore till the packet hoisted fail, after which he and young Gauntlet marched back to the inn, and having refreshed themselves, set out in post∣chaise together for Canterbury.</P>
<P>Our hero had not gone far to sea, when the wind shifted about, and blew directly in their faces, and the tide running high, they were in great danger of being lost. Mr. Joter, who had been busy in attempting to solve one of the most difficult problems in Euclid, happened in the midst of his reveries, to hear the boy call to put out the deadlights, whch frightened him so much, that he started up, and called out, "Lord have mercy upon us." Peregrine gave up all for lost, and just when he was expecting that the ship would go to the bottom, the individual Tom Pipes made his appearance on the deck. It seems that this original genius had left the castle the day after Peregrine departed, and getting to Dover some hours before he embarked, took his place in the packet, and concealed himself in the hold.</P>
<P>Alarmen by the danger he was in, Pipes got up from his lurking place, and gave such direc∣tions
<PB N="51" REF="034563_0026_0FFE2BE4AD71B678"/>
to the seamen, that the master considered him as an angel sent from heaven to deliver them. By his skill in naval affairs, they were enabled to weather the storm, and soon after the spires of Calais presented themselves to their view Jolter who was a real enemy to his own country, no sooner saw France, that land of despotism, than he began to launch out in praise of the French government. Peregrine, who had the most con∣temptible notion of his tutor's abilities, could not refrain from giving him the lie, and in proof of his opinion, no sooner had they landed, than they were surrounded by a parcel of custom house of∣ficers, who began to toss and tumble their bag∣gage about, without any regard to the so much boasted politeness of their country. As Jolter had often been in France, and consequently was well acquainted with the manners of the people, he gave the officers a bribe, and told them that his pulpil was a young English nobleman, upon which they desisted from searching any further. They told him however, that the baggage must be sealed up at the custom house, and that there were some men ready to carry the trunks thither. This so enraged Peregrine, that he knocked some of them down, calling them the most opprobri∣ous names, but in an instant a whole file of mus∣queteers surrounded the house.</P>
<P>Peregrine was not such a madman as to dispute the authority of men under arms, and therefore turning to the corporal who commanded the party, desired him to accompany his baggage to
<PB N="52" REF="034563_0027_0FFE2BE68DE720B8"/>
the custom <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> see that no harm happen∣ed to it. The corporal was so mortified at what our hero said, that he darted him a look full of contempt, telling him at the same time, that he was sorry he was so little acquainted with the French laws. As soon as they had bespoke a post∣chaise for Paris, our hero found that there was an English gentleman and his lady at the same inn, and therefore he sent Tom Pipes to the kitchen, in order to scrape an acquaintance with their foot∣man. In the mean time he and Parson Jolter went to view the fortifications, and upon their return, Pipes told Peregrine, that the gentleman was an old debauchee, who had in his youth des∣pised matrimony, but now in his advanced years had been led into a match with an oyster wench, whose impudence was equal to the station in which she had been brought up. He added, that her husband, upon mature deliberation, being ashamed of his conduct, had, in order to avoid the reproaches of his friends, and the scoffs of his companions, brought her over to France, where it was not likely that she would betray her ignorance, seeing that she did not understand one word of the language. Her temper was violent as well as vulgar, and it was with much difficulty that her husband had prevented her from engag∣ing in an intrigue with an officer, during one single day that they stopped at Canterbury.</P>
<P>Peregrine's passions were now wound up to the highest pitch, and seeing the lady at the window he made a most respectful bow to her, which she
<PB N="53" REF="034563_0027_0FFE2BE68DE720B8"/>
returned a very low curtsy. She was neatly dressed, and had he not been informed of the nature of her former station, he would have taken her for one of those pert ladies, who in general have that sort of impudence about them which their station in life conceals under another name. He did not imagine there would be any great dif∣ficulty for him to ingratiate himself into her af∣fections, and with that view he sent a card to her husband, whose name was Hornbuck, telling him that as he was to set out for Paris next day, so he would be glad of his company. Mr. Horn∣buck, who had seen all manner of scenes of de∣bauchery, no sooner received the message, than he sent a very civil answer, telling our hero that he was sorry he could not have the pleasure of his company, because his wife had been for some days indisposed.</P>
<P>Peregrine was no stranger to his motives for sending such an answer, and being extremely un∣easy that he could not gratify his in forinate pas∣sion he set out next morning with Parson Jolter in the post-chaise, being attended by his French servants, and Tom Pipes on Horseback. They breakfasted at Bologne, and it being proposed that they should reach Abeville that night, the driver went on at such a rate, that the axle-tree broke before they had got a few miles out of the town. This accident obliged them to return to Bologne, where being under the necessary of wait∣ing till next day, they saw some unfortunate
<PB N="54" REF="034563_0028_0FFE2BE886B07E70"/>
Scotch gentlemen who had been engaged in the rebellion, looking earnestly at this happy island, from whence they were forever banished. Pe∣regrine, who had a most compassionate heart, could not help sympathy sing with them, although the differed from them in political principles.</P>
<P>He invited them to spend the evening with him, but no sooner had they got heated with wine, than they forgot their unhappy circumstances, and launched out in invectives against the illustri∣ous house of Hanover. Our hero however, had too much generosity to triumph over their want of prudence, and although one of them, who was the principal aggressor, had given him a challenge, yet next morning he was so sensible of his folly, that he came to his chamber, and asked pardon in the most submissive manner, tel∣ling him that his many misfortunes had almost deprived him of the use of his natural reason. His request was granted, and having breakfasted with Peregrine, they took the most affectionate leave of each other.</P>
<P>Next day the chaise having been got ready, our adventurer, with his retinue, proceeded on their journey, and Parson Jolter continued to bestow the highest <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the French go∣vernment. Peregrine interrupted him by point∣ing to the barren desolate state of the country, and the miserable appearance of the inhabitants in their ragged cloths and wooden shoes. Jolter finding it in vain to dispute with one who could refute him from the evidence of his senses, said
<PB N="55" REF="034563_0028_0FFE2BE886B07E70"/>
no more till they came to an inn, where they partook of a small refreshment, and in the even∣ing arrived at a small village called Bernay, where they called for fresh horses, but were informed by the landlord, that none could be had, for the gates of Abeville were shut up, and there would be no possibility of their procuring <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> till next morning.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, who had often travelled that road before, did not chuse to contradict the landlord, and while supper was getting ready, our hero strolled about the yard, where to his great sur∣prise he saw another chaise come in with Mr. Hornbuck and his spouse. The landlord, though conscious that he had not victuals sufficient to serve both his guests, yet admitted the gentleman and his lady, and Peregrine, not doubting but he would find an opportunity of conversing with the lady, sent Mr. Hornbuck an invitation to sup with him.</P>
<P>Mr. Hornbuck, who was really hungry, ac∣cepted of the invitation, and Peregrine having led the lady into the room, placed her at the head of the table. During the evening, while they were at supper, the lady could not help darting some significant glances at our hero, which he took care to return, but that served only to in∣crease the jealousy of Hornbuck, who was no stranger to intrigues.</P>
<P>For some time he endeavored to conceal his resentment, but not being able to contain himself any longer, he reached out his foot to tread on
<PB N="56" REF="034563_0029_0FFE2BEFC431C2D0"/>
hers, but as ill luck would have it, he trod on the toe of parson Jolter, who happened at that time to have a severe corn. The application was made with so much good will, that the parson started up, and roared about the room like a madman, to the no small diversion of Peregrine and the lady, who laughed in such an immoder∣ate manner, that they had almost thrown them∣selves into convulsions. Hornbuck was so much confounded at the mistake he had committed, that he begged pardon of Jolter, who with tears in his eyes forgave him, and then they sat down again to supper. The rest of the evening was spent in the most agreeable manner, and when the time came that they should retire to bed, Per∣egrine handed the lady into her chamber. Mr. Hornbuck had gone down to the yard, and dur∣ing that time, our hero declared his passion to the lady, but she advised him to retire, lest her hus∣band should come in. He was not so blind as to neglect taking a hint upon which the safety of the lady depended, and therefore retiring to his chamber, spent the whole night in revolving in his mind what schemes would be most proper, in order to make Hornbuck a cuckold. The lady spoke to him in the most favorable manner, pre∣vious to his departure, and as it had been agreed upon that they should travel together next day, he doubted not but he would find an opportun∣ity of completing his design.</P>
<P>Next day they breakfasted at Abeville, where they learned that the landlord in Bernay had
<PB N="57" REF="034563_0029_0FFE2BEFC431C2D0"/>
played them a French trick, for the gates were not shut till some hours after they arrived at the village. It was late in the evening before they reached Chantilly, which is not much to be won∣dered at, when it is considered that the journey was one hundred miles. Mr. Hornbuck was so much fatigued that he knew not what to do for a little rest, and no sooner had he supped, than he fell fast asleep in his chair. Jolter, whose consti∣tution was not so delicate, had swallowed such large draughts of wine, that he began to yawn, so that Peregrine and the lady had some time to improve to their mutual wishes. Indeed Pere∣grine had taken care to have opium administered to Jolter in his wine, which operated so strongly upon him, that he dreamed the most horrible dreams, and often started up in violent agonies. At last being put to bed as well as Mr. Hornbuck, they both fell fast asleep, for the gentleman was so much overpowered, that he even forgot his spouse. Peregrine, who longed with impatience to enjoy the lady, went softly to her room, where he found her in a loose gown and petticoat, and was just about completing his wishes, when Jolter got out of bed in the next room and exclaimed <HI>fire! fire!</HI></P>
<P>Women are very fertile at contriving schemes. especially where they are under the necessity of of vindicating their honor from any aspersions that may happen to be thrown upon it, and there∣fore Mrs. Hornbuck, not doubting but her hus∣band would awake, ran into the room where Jol∣ter
<PB N="58" REF="034563_0030_0FFE2BF150CCD7A0"/>
was, and cried out, "Lord have mercy upon us, where is it?" Jolter, who was walking in his shirt, with his eyes shut, made no answer, but Peregrine vexed even to a state of madness, gave him such a slap on the shoulder, that in an instant he was brought back to the use of his reason. Mean while, Hornbuck having awaked from his sleep, and missed his spouse, doubted not but she was along with our hero, and jealousy instantly took place in his mind. In going in quest of his wife, he found that she had dropped her under petticoat, and there being no doubt remaining of her infidelity, he walked up to her, and shewed it to her. Her natural presence of mind hinted an excuse, for she declared that the petticoat was not hers, she not having such a one in her possession. Peregrine, who was very fertile at invention, told him that the petticoat belonged to the inn∣keeper's daughter, with whom he had an intrigue, and wondered how he could be so foolish, as to prevent him from enjoying a little pleasure.</P>
<P>Hornbuck was too well acquainted with the tricks practised by young gentlemen, not to see into our hero's intentions, but without discover∣ing the least mark of resentment, hastened to his bed chamber with his spouse, and next morning set out three hours before Peregrine got up.</P>
<P>Our hero was obliged to put up with his dis∣appointment, and as soon as he had taken lodg∣ings at Paris, he sent an account of his journey to the commodore. His next business was to have clothes made in the fashion, and then he
<PB N="59" REF="034563_0030_0FFE2BF150CCD7A0"/>
joined himself to a company of young gentlemen who spent the evenings in every species of de∣bauchery. Most of these were his own country∣men, and as they had much money to spend, so it is not to be wondered at that they were guilty of many irregularities. In particular they went one evening to a tavern, the landlady of which was extremely handsome, and our hero soon in∣gratiated himself into her good graces. The lady was one of those who are willing to bestow favors, so as they could be conducted with pro∣priety, without giving offence to the husband; but as ill-luck would have it, her husband was ex∣tremely jealous of her, and coming home one evening, found her in such an attitude with our adventurer, that he could not help testifying his resentment. Peregrine, who happened to be then on the eve of enjoyment, was so much vexed, that he knocked the husband down, upon which the watch was called, and all the young gentle∣men taken into custody. It happened that the officer of the night was a man of prudence, and therefore finding that little mischief had been done, he discharged them with a gentle re∣primand.</P>
<P>This affair made such a noise that it could not be long concealed from parson Jolter, and as he respected the French government above all oth∣ers in the world, he considered this part of his pupil's conduct as a high indignity offered to its laws. Indeed the tutor was such a biggoted Ja∣cobite, that his acquaintance reached no further
<PB N="60" REF="034563_0031_0FFE2BF33B7E1A40"/>
than among some of the English and Irish priests, who being extremely poor, spend much of their time in teaching foreigners the French language, and instilling into the minds of youth the utmost aversion to the English government. Such a person was not in the least qualified to be the tutor of a young gentleman of our hero's spirit, who looked upon him as a most arrant pedant. He despised every word that under the name of instruction dropped from his mouth, so that poor Jolter, in order to make the commo∣dore believe that he had, at least, in some meas∣ure discharged his duty, contented himself with writing down, from time to time, an account of the money that Peregrine spent.</P>
<P>Peregrine having procured a chariot, and all other sorts of equipage, according to the fashion of Paris, he made his appearance at all the places of public diversion, and visited the gardens and palaces. But one day as he was returning home, two carmen happened to meet in the streets, and their carts being entangled, they both fell a box∣ing according to the mode of France. Pipes who was then behind his master's coach, seeing one of the carmen on the ground, and the other belaboring him in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unmerciful manner, jumped from his station, and having set the de∣feated combatant on his legs, told him to fight boldly, and he would see fair play. According∣ly the combat was again revived, and there being another coach as well as our hero's interrupted by the engagement, one of the footmen, who
<PB N="61" REF="034563_0031_0FFE2BF33B7E1A40"/>
stood behind: struck one of the combatants with his cane.</P>
<P>Pipes, who had true notions of honor, accord∣ing to the system of English boxing, laid hold of the cane, and began to lay it about the ag∣gressor with great dexterity. The other foot∣men who were behind the coach, ran to the as∣sistance of their brother. This new reinforce∣ment did not in the least intimidate Tom Pipes; for (grasping the cane) he drove two of the foot∣men off, and belabored the other in such a man∣ner, that he was glad to beg for mercy. The whole street was now in an uproar, for the per∣son whose servants had been assaulted in this manner, was one of the princes of the blood, but being a nobleman of age and experience, and Peregrine having made some submission to him on account of his quality, his highness took him into his chariot, and treated him with every mark of respect. The prince, who perceived that our hero had more spirit and education than gen∣erally falls to one of his age, took him home to his own house, and treated him as if he had been his own son. He introduced him to his lady, and some other very respectable persons, but he soon found that the French ladies paid no regard to any but such as spend the whole of their time in gaming. Not that he had any intention to desist from gaming, but he could not see with what propriety ladies, who pretended to the highest rank, could so far demean themselves, as
<PB N="62" REF="034563_0032_0FFE2BF4FA83B4B0"/>
to spend their time in acting a part that set them on the same footing as those wretches whom we call common sharpers.</P>
<P>These considerations induced him to enter himself into a celebrated academy, where he became acquainted with several sensible people, but volatile dispositions and habits, are not soon eradicated. This will appear evident from the following anecdote. Peregrine who like most other young gentlemen, was constantly in search of new scenes of pleasure, became acquainted with one of the polite girls of the town, and ac∣cordingly took her into keeping. For some time he imagined that she was one of those, who in consquence of receiving a sufficient subsistence, would be at least faithful to him, but he was most wretchedly mistaken, for one morning Pipes came into his room, and told him that he saw a young spark in laced clothes go out of her chamber.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who had at sometimes a large com∣mand of his temper, took no notice of what was said by Tom Pipes, but going towards evening to the house of his dulcinea, told her that he was obliged for that night to go on some business of importance to a distant part of the country. The lady, who was no stranger to all the arts of her profession, pretended to be very much affected but Peregrine taking leave of her with the strong∣est professions of love, returned to his lodgings in order to prepare himself for the executing a scheme that he had formed. About twelve at
<PB N="63" REF="034563_0032_0FFE2BF4FA83B4B0"/>
night, having given Pipes the cue, they both set out for the place, and knocked at the door, which was opened to them by a footman. Peregrine bolted in, and leaving Pipes to take care of the door, ran up stairs, and knocked most violently at the door of his dulcinea's apartment. Affairs were now in a very critical situation, but there being a window to the street, the visitor dropped out of it, and so made his escape. Pipes, who happened to see him descend, made up to him, and belabored him with his cudgel, from one end of the street to the other, till being wearied with thrashing him, he gave him up to the pa∣trole, who took him into custody for the night in a most wretched condition. Next morning the French gentleman was discharged, but the dishonor of having been beaten in so vulgar a manner by an English footman, induced him to send a challenge to Peregrine, and both met together, where our hero came off conqueror, to the great mortification of the Frenchman, who was one of the officers of the guards.</P>
<P>Parson Jolter was so much offended with the conduct of his pupil, that he threatened to leave him and return to England, but Peregrine hav∣ing made some concessions, he was diverted from his design, and once more resolved to spend some time longer in his beloved France. But still no∣thing could restrain the impetuosity of our hero's passions, for intrigue seemed to give life to all his actions.</P>
<P>One day as he was walking abroad to see some
<PB N="64" REF="034563_0033_0FFE2BFAEF2A4B88"/>
of the public places, he met Mrs. Hornbuck, and in the most imprudent manner agreed to elope with her. Accordingly they set out to∣gether to a village near Paris, where they gave themselves up to voluptuous pleasure, till the poor husband having found out the place of their residence, procured an order to take them both into custody. The affair began to make a con∣siderable noise in Paris, and it might have been attended with fatal consequences, had not the English ambassador, a nobleman of great pru∣dence, interposed so far as to represent our hero as a young man who had launched out into pub∣lic life before he was acquainted with the world, In consequence of that representation our hero was set at liberty, but at the same time received a severe reprimand, with a positive injunction never to behave in the same manner for the fu∣ture.</P>
<P>Soon after he was set at liberty, he went one day to visit the public places, and in one of the galleries he met with two of his coun∣trymen, one of whom was a physician, but one of the most arrant pedants that ever lived, on the other hand the painter, who was the com∣panion of the doctor, was an ignorant fellow, who had such an opinion of his own abilities, that all the ancient painters were considered by him as objects of contempt. With these two real originals in their way, our hero contracted an acquaintance, not so much from motives that could attach him to them on the principles of
<PB N="65" REF="034563_0033_0FFE2BFAEF2A4B88"/>
virtue, as that they were objects whom he could laugh at. He attended to every thing said by them, and could scarce refrain from laughing, when he heard that the painter condemn∣ed all the painters whose works had done honor to the Italian schools; and the doctor, instead of minding the duties of his profession, spent the whole of his time in studying the most super∣ficial parts of the Greek language.</P>
<P>Peregrine took the first opportunity to intro∣duce his two new friends into the company of parson Jolter, who received them in his usual formal manner, but as ill luck would have it, the doctor who had borrowed his notions of government from the Greek classicks, spoke with the utmost contempt of the French gov∣ernment, as being entirely despotic. On the other hand Parson Jolter insisted that no form of government could be so good as that which enabled the prince to support his prerogative, because, in consequence thereof, the people were kept in humble subjection, and none of them could find fault with the measures of administra∣tion. At last the dispute arose to such a height, that both parties would have gone to blows, had not Peregrine interposed, and with the utmost difficulty made the contending parties good friends. In the mean time the doctor, who was in every sense of the word, absorbed in the study of the classic authors, proposed to have an enter∣tainment, at Paris according to the forms used
<PB N="66" REF="034563_0034_0FFE2BFDF57DF458"/>
by the old Romans; and our hero, with Parson Jolter were both invited as guests. Some other foreigners were invited at the same time, among whom was a German count, and an Italian Ba∣ron. Among other rarieties was a dormouse pye. and a sow's stomach stuffed with an hundred different sorts of herbs. The painter exclaimed that the Romans were the most beastly fellows he had ever heard of, and the Italian taking the pye on his knees, the whole contents bursled in∣to his breeches, and made him roar out in the most vociferous manner. The whole company was now one scene of riot and confusion; the doctor said all he could to apologize for the con∣duct of poor Pallate the painter, but all to no purpose, for every one was disgusted.</P>
<P>It was in vain to call the company to order, and Peregrine, who was still fond of intrigue, persuaded the painter to accompany him to the opera. There having spent the evening, they made assignations with some girls, and were just on the point of returning home, when their coach was interrupted by one belonging to a prince of the blood. Peregrine would not give way, and Tom Pipes having acted in the most extravagant manner, the whole body of them were taked into custody, and Peregrine, with the poor painter, were committed to the bastile.</P>
<P>The faithful Tom Pipes, as soon as he return∣ed home, went and informed the English ambas∣sador, and in consequence of his interposition, our hero and the painter were both set at liberty. Their release, however, was procured upon con∣dition
<PB N="67" REF="034563_0034_0FFE2BFDF57DF458"/>
that our hero should leave Paris in a short time; and accordingly, as soon as he had taken leave of his friends, he set out for Flanders.</P>
<P>The painter now began to have the most con∣temptible opinion of the doctor, and during the whole of their journey the time was spent in mu∣tual quarrellings, the one calling the other a fool, and his companion retorting by the epithet <HI>pedant.</HI> During the first day nothing was to be heard but disputes concerning the difference between a mo∣narchial and limited government, Parson Jolter always taking part with the French, and the doctor at the same time condemning them.</P>
<P>About seven in the evening they arrived at an inn, where a supper was provided for them, and as the principal part consisted of rabbits, Pere∣grine had a strong inclination to enjoy a little fun. He persuaded Tom Pipes to come into the room, and tell the guests, that there was a skin of an old ram cat hanging in the kitchen, and he was sure the body was to be served up at the table. The painter, who had just then cut up a leg of the supposed cat began to recollect that he had read the story in Gil Blas of Scipio's, and there∣fore he would not eat any more. Parson Jolter, whose stomach was not so very squeamish, told him that the people on the coast of France eat both cats and dogs, and that there could be no difference in the use of the animal, except what arose from vulgar apprehension or common in∣clination. This gave so much encouragement to the poor painter, that he proceeded to eat a little
<PB N="68" REF="034563_0035_0FFE2BFFD9EBF0C8"/>
more till a claw, that had been properly placed in the dish by Pipes, happening to fall out, he dropped his knife, and fell into a swoon. The doctor did all he could to relieve his friend pain∣ter, to a state of sensibility, and at last having in some measure affected it, they all went to bed, and next day continued their journey to Flan∣ders.</P>
<P>During their journey, the doctor expatiated on the excellency of the roads of the antients, while Parson Jolter represented those in France as far superior to any that ever had been seen.</P>
<P>In the evening they arrived in the neighbor∣hood of Arras, but the gates being then shut, they were obliged to lodge in the suburbs. It is true, they might have spent the evening with a great deal of pleasure, but as ill luck would have it, two French officers happened to come to the inn, and engaged in gaming with our hero. They were so well acquainted with the principles of gaming, that Peregrine soon found he had to do with a couple of sharpers, and in the morning, when the landlord presented his bill, which he did with fear and trembling, they told him that he was a most wicked rascal, who thus thought to impose on the king's officers.</P>
<P>As soon as they were gone, the inn-keeper came into the room, and told our hero that it was common for the military officers to do so, for such was the nature of the government in France. Peregrine, who had the most enlarged notions of government, could not help looking upon him in
<PB N="69" REF="034563_0035_0FFE2BFFD9EBF0C8"/>
any other light than as an enemy to the natural rights of mankind; but making the host some amends for the injury he had received, he pro∣ceeded on his journey along with his company. From Arras they proceeded to Lisle, where our hero soon contracted an acquaintance with several Scotch officers in the Dutch service, who had come there during the summer season, to learn the art of war. One of the Scotch officers hap∣pened to be as great a pedant in the Greek lan∣guage as the doctor himself, but then he had this advantage that he had read over the commen∣taries of the chevalier Follard.</P>
<P>Acquainted with fortification, as laid down by Vauban, he was convinced in his own mind that there was at least some difference between ancient and modern fortifications. The doctor and the officer took a walk round the ramparts, and a dis∣course ensued upon the the difference between ancient and modern fortifications. The Scotch man endeavored to show, that all towns fortified according to the modern method, must be con∣structed in such a way, as to be able to resist the force of balls, whereas the doctor said, that there was nothing could equal the methods used by the Greeks. This enraged the Scotchman so much that he challenged the doctor, but as the son of AEsculapius had no intention to fight, he applied to our hero, who accommodated matters in the most amicable manner.</P>
<P>One day as Peregrine was walking along the ramparts, he happened to fall into conversation
<PB N="70" REF="034563_0036_0FFE2C01EC5F0628"/>
with one of the Knights of Malta, who bore a commission in the French service. The dis∣course turned upon the English drama, which our hero vindicated to the satisfaction of the knight, who was himself a man of letters: but before they had done speaking. Parson Jolter arrived in a great hurry, and told them that Tom Pipes, having affronted a soldier, a great mob were gathered together, and that he was in danger of being killed. Peregrine hearing the danger his faithful Pipes was in, ran up to his assistance, and took along with him the knight of Malta, who ordered the soldier to be taken into custody, and brought before him. It seems that Pipes, in his walk thro the town, had got into company with some Irish soldiers in the French service, who treated him with great civility, but the subject of discourse happening to turn upon politics, Pipes cursed the pope the pretender, and the French king, as well as all those who were connected with either.</P>
<P>This was too high an indignity for the sol∣diers to put up with, upon which a battle en∣sued between them and Pipes, in which the latter would have had the advantage, only he had no other weapon to defend himself but his fists.</P>
<P>Peregrine was so much exasperated at the conduct of Pipes, the he immediately dismissed him from his his service; and next day the whole company set out for Ghent.</P>
<P>The whole company, besides our hero, the
<PB N="71" REF="034563_0036_0FFE2C01EC5F0628"/>
painter, the doctor, and Mr. Jolter, consisted of a lady of pleasure, a Jew broker, a capuchin Friar, and a young lady committed to the care of the latter.</P>
<P>Jolter disputed with the Jew about the mean∣ing of some words in the scriptures; the doc∣tor ridiculed the capuchin; while the painter made love to the kept mistress: and Peregrine attached himself the young lady. When the company had supped in the evening, they all retired to their own apartments; but Pere∣grine having made an assignation with the young lady, got up about midnight, and went privately to her chamber.</P>
<P>It happened that the woman of pleasure lay in a bed in the same room, and the painter hav∣ing got to the bedside just at the same time that Peregrine got to the other; the capuchin, who had some suspicions, crawled upon his all-fours, In order to make a discovery. He had scarce got up to the middle of the room when the paint∣er felt his shaved head, and the priest, who was an arch wag, turning his jaws round, bit the fin∣ger of the painter in so severe a manner that he screamed out fire! murder! theives! Peregrine was so much enraged, that he knocked the paint∣er down, and then returned to his own apartment, in order to prevent a discovery.</P>
<P>Next night when they came to Aloft, Peregrine made another attempt on the young lady, but Pall<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the painter, who had not yet relinquished his scheme, once more got into the room at the
<PB N="72" REF="034563_0037_0FFE2C07D6F76CD0"/>
same time. This so much exasperated Peregrine, that he knocked him about till there was scarce any life left in him, and then decamping in the dark, the poor painter was put to bed. The doc∣tor, who had been called out of bed to attend the patient, declared that he had been bit by a mad dog, and taking up the chamber pot, emptied the whole contents of it upon him. In the midst of his fury the painter got up, and would have done signal execution on the doctor, had not he taken to his heels out of the room, and overturn∣ed Jolter in the passage, who tumbled like a dead log of wood into the kitchen. In the morning every thing being adjusted, our travellers set out for Brussels. where Peregrine had not been long when he met accidentally with Mrs. Hornbuck, from whom he had been separated at Paris. The two lovers met together every evening at a pri∣vate house in the suburbs, but Mr. Hornbuck having discovered their retreat, hired two soldiers to lay hold of Peregrine upon his return home, and actually make him a eunuch.</P>
<P>As good fortune would have it. Tom Pipes, who had still kept near his master, tho not perceived by him, happened to hear the con∣spiratiors talking of their intended scheme, at a public house, and went and gave Peregrine in∣formation of the whole: our young hero had too much spirit to forget the behavior of Pipes at Lisle, and therefore refused at first to speak with him, but the other convinced him of the nec∣essity
<PB N="73" REF="034563_0037_0FFE2C07D6F76CD0"/>
he was under of being on his guard, upon which he was once more taken into favor.</P>
<P>A plan was now laid to defeat the scheme pro∣jected by Hornbuck: and in the evening. When the poor cuckold came to the place, he was drag∣ged to the river, and ducked over head and ears: but his cries having brought the patroic to his assistance, our hero was taken into custody. Par∣son Jolter was quite confounded at the conduct of his pupil, but as he was still under his care, he went to the governor of the city and procured his release. They then set out for Antwerp, where they had not been long when Peregrine fomented a quarrel between the painter and the doctor, and nothing less than a duel was to decide the merits of the controversy.</P>
<P>Pipes was made choice of as second to the painter, and Peregrine to the doctor: but when they went on the ramparts, being both arrant cowards, they trembled like criminals who were going to be hanged In vain did the the seconds endeavor to force them to action, they shrunk back, and the painter at last taking to his heels, Tom Pipes gave him a knock on the breech, which tumbled him down. The fall of the pain∣ter gave fresh spirits to the doctor, who making up to him, terrified him with a number <HI>of</HI> Greek verses, which he repeated from Homer, and for∣ced him to acknowledge that he had been defea∣ted.</P>
<P>From Antwerp they proceeded to visit the most
<PB N="74" REF="034563_0038_0FFE2C0B015C9E18"/>
noted places in Holland, where they met with nothing worthy of their notice, upon, which Per∣egrine, with his companions set out for Harelem, and took shipping for Harwich in England, be∣ing desirous of once more visiting his native coun∣try.</P>
<P>As soon as he arrived in England, he went to visit some eminent persons, whose relations he had met with abroad, and then set out for the castle, where he was received by the good old commo∣dore in the most gracious manner. All the poor cottagers who lived in the neighborhood, came to wish him joy on his return, and within a few weeks after he had the pleasure of seeing his be∣loved sister married to the young gentleman who had made his addresses to her before he went abroad. In the mean time his parents treated him in the same inhuman manner as before, but all this was made up by the goodness of the com∣modore.</P>
<P>Having attended the commodore with the most filial tenderness during a fit of illness, occasioned by the gout, the old gentleman proposed making over to him his whole estate, and to depend on him for a subsistance during the remainder of his life but this was what our hero would by no means comply with. The commodore being in some measure recovered. he gave Peregrine leave to return to London, and in his way thither he met with Emilia, and offered such rudeness to her, that she resolved to have nothing more to do with him. This chagrined him so much, that he
<PB N="75" REF="034563_0038_0FFE2C0B015C9E18"/>
left her mother's house in disgust; and soon after his arrival in London, met with her brother God∣frey, who, in consequence of his good behavior, had been advanced to a lieutenancy. "After some days spent in the pleasures of the town, they both set out for Bath, where by their cunning and in∣genuity they dispersed a whole gang of sharpers. At the same time they practised to many roguish tricks on the physicians, that those sons of the great AEsculapius were put to the blush amidst the whole circle of their acquaintance.</P>
<P>At Bath they became acquainted with a cer∣tain lady, whose sole business was to entertain every promiscuous company in her house with no other view save that of procuring a name. Am∣ong others who visited her was one mr. Crabtree, an old Welch gentleman; who, in consequence of some tricks that had been put upon him in his youth, became an enemy to all mankind, and was in the strictest sense of the word a misanthrope. That he might have it in his power to retail as much scandal as possible, he feigned himself dear, so that the most secret things were mentioned in his company, without the least suspicion that he heard any of them.</P>
<P>With this person our hero contracted an ac∣quaintance, and he soon perceived that he was no more deaf than himself. Peregrine was aston∣ished to hear him repeat a vast number of anec∣dotes relating to the nobility, and the frailty of nature among the females, served only to stimu∣late his desires, in order if possible, to be able to
<PB N="76" REF="034563_0039_0FFE2C0CDACCEA88"/>
add one to the number of those, who in conse∣quence of their levity had been seduced.</P>
<P>The commodore had been for some time in a had state of health, and Peregrine thought that he could not, consistent with his duty, neglect to wait on him. Accordingly he arrived at the castle, where he was received with open arms of affection, and next day his generous benefactor departed this life. He had given the most par∣ticular directions concerning his funeral: and our hero notwithstanding his volatile disposition in other things, took care to have it celebrated according to his desire.</P>
<P>The servants, whose hairs had become grey since they came to live with the commodore, la∣mented the loss of an indulgent master, and the next day after his funeral the gentlemen in the neighborhood came to congratulate our hero on his being left in possession of so ample a fortune.</P>
<P>Their principal design was to try if possible, to bring about a reconciliation between him and his mother, but all to no purpose, for she remained as obstinate as ever, and declared that Peregrine was not her son.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Peregrine having settled all his domestic affairs left the castle in order to re∣turn to London, but in his way thither be called at the house where Emilia lived, and in a most audacious manner made an attempt on her vir∣tue. The young lady treated him with that con∣tempt his conduct entitled him to, but as her
<PB N="77" REF="034563_0039_0FFE2C0CDACCEA88"/>
heart was not deaf to tender impressions she con∣sented to give him her company at a masquerade. She imagined that he would not pursue his sceme any further; but she was mistaken, for no sooner was she mixed with the croud, or rather the <HI>herd,</HI> than he made a second attempt on her virtue, but was repulsed in the same manner as before, and to complete her misfortune, her uncle, who was her guardian, and had her under his protection, for bad him from coming any more to his house, unless he had an inclination to be ducked in a horse pond.</P>
<P>Baffled in all his attempts, he was filled with the utmost chagrine, for such is the violent im∣petuossity of youth, that they are in general deaf to the voice of reason. They go on from one degree of extravagance to another, till it is too late to change, and they seek for pleasure where it can never be found. Peregrine in order to vindicate his character, wrote a long submissive letter to Mrs. Gauntlet, the mother of Emilia, but the answer he received, served only to con∣vince him that she looked upon him with the ut∣most detestation. This stimulated him to such a height, that he resolved never more to visit the place, upon which, after returning to spend a few weeks at the castle, he resolved once more to drown his cares in London. Upon his arrival in London, he met with his old friend Cadwallader the misanthrope, who informed him concerning many curious passages relating to the intrigues
<PB N="78" REF="034563_0040_0FFE2C0EAF250BC8"/>
of the ladies of quality. One of them was a dutchess, who had on all occasions prostituted herself to those who were kind enough to dis∣charge her debts contracted at a gaming table, so that upon the whole she was in a manner a dishonor to her sex. Another was one of those ladies who pay no regard to moral obligation, and therefore having lost her first husband, whom she married from motives of love, she was by the orders of her father, who at that time was one of the commissioners in the custom house, obliged to give her hand to an Irishman, who, taking him altogether, was one of the most insignificant wretches that ever lived. They had not been long married, when the lady discovered such aversion to her husband, that she began to intrigue with several of the young nobility, and actually went over with one of them to France, where they spent a whole summer together. At last she returned to England, and finding no other way left, in order to support her in her extrava∣gance, she once more threw herself into the arms of her husband, and spent the remainder of her time in privacy.</P>
<P>Peregrine who had so much art, that scarce any thing could deceive him, resolved to make him∣self merry at the expence of his fellow creatures. Accordingly he got Cadwallader to assume the character of a fortune-teller, and in consequence thereof, he soon got acquainted with the many secrets that would otherwise have been buried in perpetual oblivion. To a young gentleman like
<PB N="79" REF="034563_0040_0FFE2C0EAF250BC8"/>
our hero, this could not fail of yielding a consid∣erable degree of entertainment, and in conse∣quence thereof, he was at all times able to tri∣umph over the most dignified female characters. Nothing was more common for him than to en∣ter into an intrigue with a lady of quality, and as he knew well her prior character, he thought there could be no hurt in exposing her for the fa∣vor she had granted him. Peregrine, who never knew where to stop, when he wanted to indulge his favorite passion for ridicule, resolved to give such a mark of his ingenuity, as would transmit his name to all future ages.</P>
<P>Among the circle of his friends, he became acquainted with two notorious free-thinkers, or as we call them, deists, and these men having made a mock of all sorts of apparitions, he con∣trived to raise a fictitious one, that actually frightened them into the utmost state of super∣stition. The devil was represented as arising from hell, to take those infidels along with him to the infernal regions, and notwithstanding all the pretensions that our deists had made, yet when they saw the old gentleman with the cloven foot appear, they trembled as an aspin leaf, and for once declared, their deistical notions were not able to carry them thro in a day of adversity. They could not help reflecting that the heathens believed there was a future state of rewards and punishments, and that brutal forti∣tude to which they had so long attached them∣selves, vanished into nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="034563_0041_0FFE2C11A107CB98"/>
It was not long before our hero became cel∣ebrated for being one of the greatest wits of the town. He took notice of the conduct of the different nobility and gentry who happened to be in his company, and he drew their characters according to the observations he had made. One in particular, who had been long represented as a patriot, or in other words a lover of his country, he represented, according to justice, as a most vile infamous debauchee, who had pretended to set up a scheme of reformation for the whole kingdom, while he knew at the same time that he was wallowing in lust with several common pros∣titutes. However volatile he might be in his own disposition, he could not help treating with the utmost abhorence, those wretches who set up for reformers of the nation, while at the same time their own houses exhibit nothing but scenes of debauchery. In the public news papers, and many other periodical works, he endeavored to represent those wretches in their lively colors, and surely nothing could be more commendable. Shall the debauchee set up to reform the nation and promote charity, when at the same time he knows that he is going on in a course of impu∣nity? Shall the spendthrift attempt to teach economy to the people, while he knows at the same time that he is living above his circumstan∣ces? In a word, Peregrine was convinced in his own mind, that private virtue and patriotism must, or at least ought to, go hand in hand to∣gether, and therefore it will appear to some of
<PB N="81" REF="034563_0041_0FFE2C11A107CB98"/>
our more sensible readers, that those who are not capable to take care of their own affairs, will never be able to attend those of a public nature. Indeed it is a notion that has been too much cul∣tivated in the present age, that people may be wicked at home, and at the same time virtuous abroad, but this is inconsistent with the first prin∣ciples of natural reason, for he that is faithful over little, will be faithful over much.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Hatchway had now been married some time to the widow of the commodore, but that lady had so far given herself up to drinking, that she was seized with a dropsy, and there be∣ing no hopes that she would recover, her hus∣band sent Peregrine a letter in the stile of a sea∣man, desiring his immediate attendance at the garrison.</P>
<P>Peregrine no sooner received the honest lieu∣tenant's epistle, than he set out for the garrison, where he found his aunt in the agonies of death, and staid to perform the last offices to her, after which he returned, in order to visit his compan∣ions in London. In his way to London he called on his friend Gauntlet, and had the good fortune to see him happily married to the young lady whom he had courted several years. Indeed Per∣egrine would have willingly married Emilia at the same time, but such was his attachment to gallantry, that he still entertained hopes, or rath∣er wishes, of having it in his power to seduce that young lady, and to triumph over her shame.</P>
<P>Baffled however, in all his attempts on her vir∣tue,
<PB N="82" REF="034563_0042_0FFE2C17AA496C98"/>
he set out for London, but had not been long there, when he returned to the garrison on a visit to honest Lieutenant Hatchway, who treated him with the utmost respect. Having settled several of his domestic affairs, he took leave of the Lieutenant, and in his journey picked up a young gypsey, whom he resolved to take into keeping.</P>
<P>Tom Pipes was ordered to see her washed clean and dressed in a proper, manner, and altho her countenance had something ferocious in it, yet she was in many respects as agreeable as some of the court ladies. He introduced her to all the noted gaming tables, where she made a very dis∣tinguishing figure, for it was but a short time before she made herself acquainted with all the tricks practised in those polite circles. But not∣withstanding her natural rusticity, yet she had the seeds of honesty in her mind; for one evening at a gaming table, having discovered that one of the ladies was a dexterous hand at cheating, she call∣ed her a damned bitch, and walking towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bid her kiss her arse. The ladies present upbraided our hero, with having palmed upon them a common trust and he having been cloyed with possession, gave her some money, and left her to make her fortune in the world in the best manner she could, so that she soon after became one of the women of the town.</P>
<P>Soon after he had discarded the young gypsey, he was advised by his old acquaintance Pallat, the painter, who had accompanied him in his journey from Paris to Flanders. The painter
<PB N="83" REF="034563_0042_0FFE2C17AA496C98"/>
had▪ got some poor daubings of several capital works of the Flemish schools, and had proposed to sell them by subscription, so that he was under the necessity of making himself acquainted with as many of the nobility and gentry as possible. Peregrine looked upon him with the utmost con∣tempt, but as he knew him to be poor, he did not say any thing to discourage him.</P>
<P>In the course of their conversation, the subject turned upon gaming, and our hero, who was altogether of a volatile disposition, embraced an opportunity that Pallat offered him, of being in∣troduced to the acquaintance of Lord Sweep∣stakes who had for many years made the most distinguishing figure at Newmarket. As Peregrine had a considerable sum of money at his disposal, it was not long before he was fleeced of the greatest part: for gamblers, let their stations, be what they will, are no better than cheats.</P>
<P>Vexed to find himself bubbled in that scandal∣ous manner, he resolved to get into the ministry, and for that purpose ingratiated himself into the favor of a nobleman, who proposed setting him up as a candidate for one of the rotten boroughs.</P>
<P>This led him into a fresh series of expences, but the other candidate having by opposite in∣terest become more successful than Peregrine, he was obliged to sit down with his loss, and curse both government and ministers.</P>
<P>As Peregrine had good natural parts, he re∣solved to become a dependant on the ministry <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their vindication he wrote several very satirical
<PB N="84" REF="034563_0043_0FFDC74035D75340"/>
papers. This employment, however, was of too mean a nature to support a young gentleman of our hero's spirit, especially as the dignified no∣bleman gave him nothing but promises for all his trouble. It was natural for him under such circumstances to descend gradually to meanness, and notwithstanding the elegant manner in which our hero had been brought up, yet he became every day more and more an object of contempt among all those with whom he had been form∣erly acquainted.</P>
<P>Tortured with these melancholy reflections, he one day took a walk to the park, where he had not been long, when he was accosted by his old friend Gauntlet; who, soon after his marriage, had been advanced to the command of a compa∣ny. Gauntlet was accompanied by his wife and sister, and no sooner had our hero seen the latter, than all those former emotions took place in his mind, that her person had first inspired. He said every thing he could think of in vindication of his conduct, but the young lady was extremely shy, and told him that nothing but a constant per∣severance in the practice of every moral duty, would intitle him to her favor. They conversed together sometime, and when they took their leave, he swore everlasting constancy to the object of his love, after which they parted for the pres∣ent with very different sentiments, for our hero was tortured with the thoughts of having incur∣red the displeasure of his Emilia.</P>
<P>He next associated himself with a club of au∣thors,
<PB N="85" REF="034563_0043_0FFDC74035D75340"/>
most of whom were despicable wretches, but they were at the same time so proud, that they would not for some time make him ac∣quainted with all their secrets. As his wants were daily encreasing, he had recourse once more to the minister, who had so long filled his mind with promises that he never intended to per∣form▪ but altho several lucrative places where then vacant, yet he was given to understand that they had all been disposed of. This declaration of the minister mortified him so much, that he could not conceal his resentment any longer, and therefore turning about, he left the presence chamber in the utmost disgust. From the min∣ister's house, he went to visit the authors, whom he sound engaged in a most violent dispute con∣cerning the merits of some of their performances.</P>
<P>Peregrine had but little to say, for as yet he was no more than a novice, but as ill luck would have it, in the midst of the dispute, a bailiff came with a writ against one of them. The defend∣ant, who was no stranger to the power of catch-poles, no sooner heard of his danger, than he jumped out of the window, and pitching upon the top of a sedan, ovterturned it, with a young ma∣caroni who had been dressed out in the highest taste, in order to make his appearance at the opera. In the mean time he became acquaint∣ed with some of those insignificant wretches called antiquarians, who spend most of their time in looking over old coins and manuscripts, that
<PB N="86" REF="034563_0044_0FFE2C1B17F57BE0"/>
cannot be read but by the help of magnifying glass, and an index to explain the contractions. He had the good fortune however, in conse∣quence of his political writings, to procure a small pension from the minister, which for some time was regularly paid, but as he still wished for a settlement, he one day put the minister in mind of his promise, and as he did not receive a satisfactory answer, he went home and wrote him a letter, wherein he taxed him with duplicity, and the consequence was, that he was instantly discharged. The affair of being discarded made some noise among those at the head of affairs; but the minister, who was hackneyed in all the ways of iniquity, told them that our hero was disordered in his mind, and for some time the story was believed. In revenge for being treated in so disgraceful a manner, be commenced a writer against the ministry and treated the whole of their conduct with such ridicule, that they be∣came objects of detestation to all ranks of peo∣ple in the nation.</P>
<P>But this did not answer his expectation, for the minister who had never entered into any agreement with him, caused him to be arrested, and from a spunging-kouse he was removed to the Fleet prison. There he found his confine∣ment much better than is common in other prisons and he met with several persons who did all they could to make his confinement as agreeable as possible. Among others, he met with a person who had spent his whole fortune,
<PB N="87" REF="034563_0044_0FFE2C1B17F57BE0"/>
in order to procure justice to an injuried young gentleman, but by a quibble in law, which will ever remain a disgrace to justice, he had been nonsuited, and in consequence thereof, not being able to pay his costs, he was arrested and com∣mitted to prison.</P>
<P>The news of Peregrine being committed to prison soon reached the ears of lieutenant Hatch∣way, who with all his foibles was really a good man. The honest lieutenant, in company with Tom Pipes, set out for London and not knowing Peregrine was to be confined for life, proposed taking lodgings along with him in the fleet.</P>
<P>Peregrine said all he could to dissuade them from such a resolution, but all that he could pre∣vail upon them to do was to take lodgings in the same neighborhood. As it was their constant practice to visit our hero two or three times in the day, and to spend the evenings with him, so one night while Crabtree, the misanthrope was there, they happened to quarrel, and the poor Welchman was tossed in a blanket. This was considered as such an outrage, that the warden ordered that Hatchway and Pipes should never be again admitted into the prison, and in the mean time Peregrine gave himself up to all manner of sloth and nastiness.</P>
<P>While he continued in this deplorable situation, his old friend Gauntlet, who had come to town in order to procure advancement in the army, came to the fleet to visit him, and condoled with
<PB N="88" REF="034563_0045_0FFE2C1F925A9FA8"/>
him on the unhappy state of his then circum∣stances.</P>
<P>As good luck would have it, a person to whom Peregrine had lent some money, to equip him for an East India voyage, happened at that time to arrive in the Downs, and as he had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with considerable success, he came to the prison and paid the debt for which our hero had been ar∣rested.</P>
<P>Being thus at liberty, he went to visit his old friend the lieutenant, who, notwithstanding some disputes that they had before, received him with open arms of friendship. He was informed by Hatchway, that his father had been dead some time, and that he had left his whole fortune to his son Gam. That was a most mortifying stroke to our hero, who notwithstanding all the unnat∣ural usage of his parents, yet imagined that his father would have done him justice at last. This induced him to hold a consultation with his friends, who were all of opinion that there was something unfair, and that it would be necessary to make a proper enquiry into the nature of the will. This led to a discovery that the whole was a collusion carried on by the intrigues of his mo∣ther, who had got a false will substituted in the room of the true one, to the injury of her eldest son. This led to a further enquiry, and upon the most mature deliberation the whole cheat was discovered. The noise occasioned by this affair reached all over the country, but our hero, con∣sistent with his common notions of benevolence,
<PB N="89" REF="034563_0045_0FFE2C1F925A9FA8"/>
made a settlement on his mother and brother, after which he took possession of his estate, and proved himself to be the real heir at law to his father, notwithstanding all that had been done to injure him.</P>
<P>Having settled every thing of importance, he went to see his friend Gauntlet, and it was agreed upon between them to spend some time in the country. This was in a manner absolutely ne∣cessary for our hero, who had been confined se∣veral months, in a prison, as the principle reason was to bring about a match between the two lovers.</P>
<P>Gauntlet had a real friendship for Peregrine and told him that he would do every thing in his power to bring about an eclaircissement between him and his sister. Accordingly our hero was in∣dulged with an interview with his beloved Emi∣lia, but she was so much on the reserve that it did not give him any satisfaction. Mortified at his disappoinment he retired into another room, but had not been there long when he heard a di∣alogue between the brother and sister, that gave him the most inexpressible pleasure. Emilia said she had no objections to Peregrine, except such as arose from the nature of his conduct, which on many occasions had been very irregular. To this her brother answered, that whatever might have been his foibles, yet they were merely owing to the unguarded sallies, of youthful imprudence, but as he had now returned to a regular discharge
<PB N="90" REF="034563_0046_0FFE2C23EDB0D6A0"/>
of his duty as a man of honor and virtue, she could not with the least colour of reason have any objection to him.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who overheard this discourse, was in a manner quite transported, and waited for an opportunity, of embracing his charmer, and run∣ning into her room flung himself at her feet in humble prostration.</P>
<P>As she could not bear to see him in that atti∣tude, she gave him encouragement to rise, and then clasping her in his arms, he told her that he was forever devoted to her, and that he would live and die with her. She told him, that he had been so wicked, that he ought to have undergone a severe punishment, but as things then were, she was willing at once to pardon him, and put up with a man for her husband whom she believed would be an arrant tyrant. In answer to this as he was scarce able to speak, he told her that he had eighty thousand pounds in money, which should be at her service, and as a proof of his sincerity, he offered to lay the whole in her lap. So shying, he clasped her again in his arms, and sealed the contract into which he had entered, with bestowing a thousand kisses upon her who was more dear to him than his life.</P>
<P>Every thing being settled for the nuptials, our hero set out for the commons, in order to procure a licence, by which his happiness was to be sealed. It is true Emilia made some ob∣jection to his being so precipitate in an affair of such importaace,, but her brother, the captain,
<PB N="91" REF="034563_0046_0FFE2C23EDB0D6A0"/>
having interposed, she was brought to hearken to the voice of reason, and gave her consent to the performance of the ceremony. Lieutenant Hatchway, who had never lost sight of our hero, resolved to be present at the ceremony of the marriage, and as he always liked a little fun, he proposed to make Peregrine drunk, previous to his going to bed. In that, however, he was dis∣appointed, for our hero was on his guard, and took care not to drink any more liquor than was necessary.</P>
<P>The ceremony being over, Tom Pipes danced like a madman, as if he had been on the forecastle of a man of war, while Hatchway regaled him∣self over a bowl of rum and water, in the same manner as if he had been on the quarter deck of the commodore's ship. At last the new married couple retired, and next day was spent in the ut∣most degree of festivity. From London they set out for the country, where our hero ordered the castle to be put in proper repair, and having set∣tled every thing with his tenants he went to visit his sister, whom he found the mother of two beau∣tiful young children.</P>
<P>He was, as well as his spouse, received by her with every mark of respect, and rejoiced in hav∣ing it in his power to contribute towards pro∣moting her happiness. He lived agreeably and happily with his dear Emilia, and she soon made him a happy father.</P>
<P>Their friends and acquaintance looked upon themselves as happy in being connected with two
<PB N="92" REF="034563_0047_0FFE2C25B112E1A8"/>
persons of so much worth, and their fame for the exercise of every benevolent action, reached to the exterior parts of the country, where their names were known.</P>
<P>Peregrine detached himself from every vicious practice, and day after day convinced his wife that he was far from being an object unworthy of her choice, or improper for her to place her affections upon.</P>
<P>To conclude this work it is necessary to take notice of what happened to the other celebrated personages who have been so often mentioned in it. We have already consigned the commo∣dore to the silent grave, and have seen that his widow, after having been married some years to Lieutenant Hatchway, paid the debt of nature, and was deposited beside her first husband, or to use the sea phrase, she was safely moored.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Hatchway survived the marriage of our hero about two years, most part of which was spent in drinking his can of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and smoak∣ing his pipe. He often wished for war that he might have one opportunity more of giving or∣ders on the quarter-deck; but as nothing of that nature happened, he was obliged to come to an anchor, and be laid up in an everlasting dock.</P>
<P>Tom Pipes survived him about three years, and was treated by Peregrine with every mark of respect, and what added most to his pleasure was, that the lovely Emilia suffered him to have a hammock to swing in, as if he had been still
<PB N="93" REF="034563_0047_0FFE2C25B112E1A8"/>
on board, or in the garrison. At last a violent storm obliged him to slip his anchor, and as there was none ready to take him in row, he went to bottom and was never after heard of.</P>
<P>The doctor whose feast had made such a distinguishing figure at Paris and antwerp, returned to London, where he published pro∣posals for a translation of Pindar from the original Greek; but not meeting with the suc∣cess he expected, he commenced writer for a bookseller, and did every thing in his power to ridicule the Christian system. At last he became so notorious for his licentious writings, that an indictment was preferred against him, and being found guilty on the clearest evidence, he was committed to Newgate, till such time as he should pay a fine according to the judgment of the court. There he continued near two years in the utmost state of penury, till at last being forced by necessity, he wrote in defence of admi∣nistration, and in consequence thereof procured his release, and at the same time received a pen∣sion of three hundred pounds a year, by the in∣tercession of those in power.</P>
<P>The minister of state, by whose cruelty our hero had been so long vilely oppressed, was, in consequence of a change at court, turned out of all employments, and spent the remainder of his time in fomenting schemes to cross the measures of government. At last he died, not only un∣pitied, but even hated by all those who had for∣merly known him, nor was there one left to shed
<PB N="94" REF="034563_0048_0FFE2C27DAB3B180"/>
a tear over his grave. He had domineered over his fellow subjects while he was intrusted with power, but no sooner were his remains laid in the grave, than some of the meanest of them trod on them.</P>
<P>Pallat, the painter, who was one of the most arrant blockheads that ever lived, published pro∣posals for some of his daubings, but they were executed in so wretched a manner, that he became an object of detestation to all these who knew him. His family was reduced to want, and his creditors becoming clamorous, he was arrested, and glad to take up the same lodgings in the Fleet, from which our hero had been so fortu∣nately delivered. There he remained till he was set at liberty by an act of insolvency, and the rest of his days were spent in penury, which would have been still greater, had not our hero contributed towards his assistance.</P>
<P>With respect to our hero, he soon obtained a seat in parliament, and made a most distinguish∣ing figure as a a British senator. His family in∣creased in the course of time, and such was his benevolence, that he never lost sight of such op∣portunities as put it in his power to be service∣able to his fellow creatures. From the whole of these circumstances we may learn, that it is nev∣er too late to refrain from vicious courses, and that whenever information takes place, beneficial consequences will follow. Such is the nature of things in this world, that we never know when
<PB N="95" REF="034563_0048_0FFE2C27DAB3B180"/>
to form a judgment till we are directed by the consequences, and this should teach us to watch over every part of our conduct▪ and to make it appear to the world that we are not unworthy members of society.</P>

<P>A London gentleman went to see his relations in the country. The house was full, a wedding being celebrated there. Only one room was vacant. There no one chose to sleep, as it was supposed to be haunted. The London spark had no fear about him, and said he would sleep
<PB N="101" REF="034563_0051_0FFDC7468A04B668"/>
there. He fell asleep. About three in the morning he was wakened by the opening of the door, and the enterance of young women in appearance, with only a night dress an head, ann shoift on. This lovely appearence walked two or three times about the room, and at length laid itself down on the bed. The young gentleman did not much like his unknown bedfellow. He lay as far as he could on the other side. After sometime he perceived his bedfellow breathe, and supposing her to be true flesh and blood, and no phantom, he ventured to touch her. He was confirmed in his opinion, and finding a ring on her finger, he gently took it off. She lay some time, and he did not disturb her. She then got up, and went out of the room as she came in. The young gentleman perceived how the room was haunted, by a female walking in her sleep. The morning came. The family were inquisi∣tive about him. He desired the family might be summoned, when lo! the ring fitted the eldest daughter's finger, who had been in great tribulation about the loss. "This, Sir," said he to the father, "is the lovely spirit which haunts the room." She declared herself perfectly ig∣norant; but was convinced of its truth because of the ring. "Well, Sir," said the father, "if you have no objection, since my daughter has been to bed to you, you shall go to bed to my daughter; and there is 5000l. for her portion." The match was that day consummated.</P>
