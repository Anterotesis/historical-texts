<BIBL>ISAIAH XXII. 21.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And I will clothe him with thy Robe, and strengthen him with thy Girdle; and I will commit thy Government into his Hand, and he shall be a</HI> FATHER <HI>to the Inhabitants of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and to the House of</HI> Judah.</Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Need not tell any here the <HI>Occasion</HI> of <HI>this Anniversary Solemnity</HI>; It being too well known already to make this necessary; but shall chuse rather, in the Words of <HI>another,</HI> spoken, not upon the <HI>same,</HI> yet on an high and great Occasion, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid <HI>Atterbury</HI>'s Ser. before the <HI>President</HI> and <HI>Go∣vernours</HI> of the <HI>Hospitals,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> to say, (partly in order to
<PB N="6" REF="006175_0005_102800E56D0B3060"/>
obtain, if it may be, the <HI>Candour</HI> of this <HI>august Assembly</HI>; and partly, to <HI>apologize</HI> for the many Defects which my <HI>Hearers</HI> will doubtless discover in the <HI>present Performance</HI>) That <Q>So many eminent Pens have gone before in this Way, as have left it very difficult for those who come after, either to say any Thing which they <HI>have not</HI> said, or not to say, that much worse which they <HI>have.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon being informed, that our <HI>Honourable Rulers</HI> (sure I am, very unexpected to me) had <HI>Ordered</HI> I should Preach before Them on <HI>this</HI> solemn Occasion, my Thoughts fixed upon the <HI>Words</HI> read; which, if God shall please to afford his gracious Assistance, may be profitably handled, and appear to be <HI>a Word in Season.</HI></P>
<P>In order to the clearer Understanding of <HI>them,</HI> it will be requisite to look back to the 15th Verse of the Chapter, where, and in the Verses following, the Prophet is directed to go and deliver a sad Message to <HI>Shehna,</HI> to tell him, that though he made <HI>Prepa∣ration</HI> for a pompous Sepulture in the Place where he then was, he should <HI>surely</HI> be <HI>violently tossed like a Ball into a large Country,</HI> and <HI>there die,</HI> and be suc∣ceeded in his Office by one better than he, meaning <HI>Eliakim.</HI> As to <HI>Shehna</HI> and <HI>Eliakim</HI> <Q>Both of them had been Ministers of State under King <HI>Hezekiah, Shehna</HI> having been his Scribe or Secretary, and <HI>Eliakim</HI> the Master of his Houshold. And their History (says a learned Man <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prideaux</HI>'s Connection, &amp;c. Vol. I. P.45.</NOTE>) as far as may be collected from the Words of the Prophet, ap∣pears to be thus. <HI>Shehna</HI> being a very wicked Man was a fit Person to serve the Lusts and
<PB N="7" REF="006175_0006_102803650C5A1430"/>
evil Inclinations of <HI>Manasseh</HI> in the first Part of his Reign, and therefore was made his first Mi∣nister Of State; and <HI>Eliakim,</HI> who was of a quite contrary Character, was quite laid aside. But on the Revolution that happened on the coming of the Army of the <HI>Assyrians, Shehna</HI> was taken Pri∣soner with his Master, and carried to <HI>Babylon,</HI> and there detained in Captivity to his Death. And therefore <HI>Manasseh</HI> on his Repentance and return to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> having resolved on other Measures, called for <HI>Eliakim,</HI> and put the Management of all his Affairs into his Hands, who being a Person of great Wisdom, Justice and Piety soon re-established them upon the same Foot as they had been in the Days of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and so preserved them in Peace and Prosperity all his Time, to the great Honour of the King, and the Good of all his People, and therefore he hath the Character given him of being a <HI>Father to the Inhabitants of</HI> Je∣rusalem, <HI>and to the House of</HI> Judah.</Q> Thus he.</P>
<P>The <HI>Robe</HI> and <HI>Girdle</HI> mentioned in the Text, are Ensigns of <HI>Authority.</HI> The Former very peculiar to <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Magistrates,</HI> hence it is said concerning the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> and <HI>Jehosophat</HI> the King of <HI>Ju∣dah,</HI> that they <HI>sat each on his Throne, having put on their Robes.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 22.10.</NOTE>—Purple</HI> was anciently the Colour of the Garment or Robe worn by the Chief Ruler among the <HI>Romans</HI>: So that to send any one the <HI>Purple</HI> was in Effect to declare him <HI>Emperour</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Due</HI> Hist. Vol II. P.76.</NOTE> The Latter, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Girdle,</HI> is likewise a Mark of Distinction; the Word signifies <HI>Strength</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Caryl.</HI></NOTE>, as well as
<PB N="8" REF="006175_0007_102800E6F4AF3690"/>
a Girdle, because a Girdle causeth Strength. A good Ruler is the <HI>Strength,</HI> the <HI>Girdle</HI> of his Poeple. For by his wise and just Administration, an enseebled State will be cherished and invigorated, confirmed and united, as a <HI>Girdle</HI> or <HI>Belt</HI> doth bind and strength∣en the Loins of him that wears it.</P>
<P>It follows,</P>
<P><HI>And I will commit thy Government into his Hand.</HI> Civil Government is not an <HI>accidental</HI> Thing, which Men have hit upon by Chance, but is of Divine Institution; <HI>By Me Kings reign</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8.15.</NOTE>. <HI>The Powers that be, are ordained of God,</HI> says the Apostle <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rom. 13.1.</NOTE>. And this <HI>Ordination</HI> is so necessary that Public Communities cannot subsist without it. <HI>Anarchy</HI> unavoidably tends to Confusion and Ruin. When <HI>there was no King in</HI> Israel, 'tis said <HI>every Man did that which was right in his own Eyes.</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Judges 17.6.</NOTE> And when this comes to be the Case, a worse State of Things can hardly be imagined.</P>
<P>Whereas, When the <HI>Civil Magistrate</HI> is to those under his Inspection, what <HI>Eliakim</HI> is told here in the Text, he should be <HI>to the Inhabitants of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and to the House of</HI> Judah, <HI>viz.</HI> A FATHER, there will be more than a seint Image of the happy Times that were in <HI>Solo∣mon</HI>'s Reign, when it is said, <HI>Judah and Israel dwell safely, every Man under his Vine, and under his Fig-Tree.</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 4.25.</NOTE> The Appellation here fixed upon <HI>Eliakim</HI> is a fit Title for a good <HI>Governour.</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eng. Annot.</HI> in loc.</NOTE> And therefore you may be sure, that in the Progress of this Discourse I shall not forget it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006175_0008_10280366D27DF688"/>What has been said upon the Words under Consi∣deration, opens the Way for these Two Observations, which I shall offer from them,</P>
<P>Obs. I That <HI>there are</HI> outward <HI>Marks of Distinction and Honour, and Ensigns of Authority, which especially belong to the Civil Magistrate.</HI></P>
<P>Obs. II That <HI>Good Rulers are, and should be</HI> FATHERS to their People.</P>
<P>I shall handle both these Points with as much Bre∣vity as I can conveniently; supposing that the <HI>Elections</HI> to be made this Day of His MAJESTY'S COUNCIL, will not admit of a <HI>long Discourse</HI> from the Pulpit. The</P>
<P>1<SUP>st</SUP> Obs. is this, That <HI>there are</HI> outward <HI>Marks of Distinction and Honour, and Ensigns of Authority which especially belong to the Civil Magistrate.</HI></P>
<P>Notice is here taken of the <HI>Robe, Girdle,</HI> or <HI>Belt,</HI> and elsewhere <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Job 29.14</NOTE> of the <HI>Diadem</HI>; all which, as also <HI>Crowns, Scepters, Gold Chains,</HI> &amp;c. are Emblems of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI>; and therefore <HI>Princes</HI> and Potentates, have by the unanimous Vote of Mankind, had these Marks of Respect conferred upon them. All Ages have been content, that those who <HI>govern</HI> them should be distin∣guished from the <HI>Vulgar,</HI> and make a more splendid Appearance upon all Occasions than a <HI>Peasant.</HI> And if they do not, they are apt to be look'd upon with Contempt. <Q>History (says one <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Caryl.</HI></NOTE>) makes report of a very famous <HI>King,</HI> who coming to <HI>Egypt,</HI> a mighty Concourse of people flocked from all Parts to see
<PB N="10" REF="006175_0009_102800E9C9576350"/>
him, but when they found him without any <HI>State,</HI> an old man in a mean Habit, they went away Laugh∣ing, none regarding him.</Q></P>
<P>But not to inlarge here; I shall proceed to offer a few <HI>Reasons,</HI> why those who are advanced to Places of Power (as Civil Rulers are) should be <HI>distinguished</HI> from others, by <HI>external</HI> marks of <HI>Grandeur.</HI> And they are these that follow,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To be a Motive to Rulers to excite them to Vi∣gilance and Care for the Good and Welfare of those, on whose Account they have a just Title to those Ensigns of Authority.</HI> A <HI>Ruler</HI> is not prefer'd to <HI>that</HI> Dignity only to give him Liesure to be slothful and indolent, put in order to inspire him with Resolutions of acting in his exalted Station agreable to it: So that the Ho∣nours done to him ought, and should be so many <HI>Monitors</HI> to him, to lay out himself with so much the greater Diligence and Fidelity in serving the <HI>Publick.</HI></P>
<P>I believe the high Dignity <HI>Joseph</HI> was raised to in <HI>Egypt,</HI> was a considerable <HI>Incentive</HI> to him to be very active in promoting the Welfare of that Kingdom. For after the Account that is given of the Marks of Respect <HI>Pharaoh</HI> put upon him, by placing him next to him∣self in Authority, and giving him his <HI>Ring</HI> from off his Finger, clothing him with <HI>sine Linnen,</HI> and putting a <HI>gold chain about his Neck</HI>; I say, after all this, it is said, that <HI>Joseph went out over all the Land of Egypt</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 41.41, 42, 43, 45.</NOTE>. He forthwith applied himself to the Duties belonging to his Station, and did not content himself at Home in the enjoyment of the Honours conferred upon him, but by
<PB N="11" REF="006175_0010_10280369A3EC1F08"/>
his Diligence and Activity in his Office, let the King who had thus advanced him see, that his Favours were not misplac'd.</P>
<P>Indeed, Civil Rulers have much better, stronger and higher Motives to be public <HI>Benefactors</HI> than any <HI>Ex∣ternal Honours,</HI> that are done them, can be; such as their being in a Capacity more <HI>extensively</HI> to <HI>serve</HI> their <HI>Generation,</HI> than those who move in a lower Sphere; and the high <HI>Reward</HI> that shall be given them in Hea∣ven, if they do it <HI>religiously.</HI> But still <HI>outward Marks</HI> of Respect and Honour have their use and influence to this Purpose.</P>
<P N="2">2. The publick Honours paid to Civil Rulers are partly designed for the <HI>Safeguard</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> of their <HI>Persons.</HI> If Rulers behave in their Office suitable to the Dignity of it, and discharge with a laudable Fidelity the Trust reposed in them, the <HI>State</HI> ought to be more than a little concerned to preserve and protect them. Men in high Stations are sometimes exposed to the Rage of unthinking People, and malign'd by envenom'd Tongues, while at the same Time they are endeavour∣ing faithfully to serve the Public; <HI>Is it a small Thing that thou hast brought us up out of a Land that floweth with Milk and Honey, to kill us in this Wilderness, ex∣cept thou make thy self altogether a Prince over us?—Wilt thou put out the Eyes of these Men? We will not come up,</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> 16.13, I4.</NOTE> is Language that the meekest Man on Earth, and one of the best Rulers, was treated with, by an obliged, tho' ungrateful People. And it were well, if nothing of this Spirit were now to be found in the World, The Civil Ruler being <Q>the <HI>Guardian</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="006175_0011_102800EB502F2488"/>
of the publick Quiet; appointed to restrain Violence,—and to preserve that Order and Peace which preserves the World: It is apparent, on these, and many other Accounts, what Hazards a good Ma∣gistrate runs; and therefore the Retinue of State which belongs to him, is such as may, at the same Time, be his Ornament and Defence.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. and <HI>Lastly,</HI> External Marks of Honour are like∣wise appropriated to Rulers, in order to promote in those under their Authority a proper Esteem and Re∣gard for them. Not that it is to be supposed any are so weak as to be influenced to behave dutifully towards Rulers, and treat them with Reverence merely on the Account of the outward Splendor, annexed to their Office, but that <HI>this</HI> may be some Inducement to People to shew them that Respect and pay that Defference to them which is justly due to their Character.</P>
<P>None then should envy the civil Ruler those Marks of Honour which the Oracles of God entitle him to, and the Wisdom of Nations hath thought it proper he should enjoy: Since such valuable Ends as we have heard may be served hereby.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">II. Obs. That <HI>Good Rulers are, and should be</HI> FATHERS <HI>to their People.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas my Purpose chiefly to have insisted upon <HI>this,</HI> but the Time, I perceive, will not admit of much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here; and therefore shall content myself as briefly as I can,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="006175_0012_1028036EE30BA630"/>1. To shew, <HI>Wherein</HI> Civil Rulers should be FATHERS to their People. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. What <HI>Obligation</HI> they are under to be so.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to shew, <HI>Wherein</HI> Civil Rulers should be FATHERS to their People.</P>
<P>This is an Appellation given in the Scripture to Persons cloathed with Publick Authority. Hence KINGS are called <HI>nursing Fathers</HI>; and <HI>Naaman</HI>'s Servant addressed him in the same Stile of Respect and Reverence, who <HI>was a great Man with his Master</HI> (the King of <HI>Syria</HI>) <HI>and Honourable,</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 5.1.13.</NOTE>
<HI>My Father, if the Prophet had had thee do some great Thing,</HI> &amp;c. And 'tis related of <HI>Augustus</HI> (who perhaps was one of the best and wisest of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, before the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> was publickly countenanced in <HI>that State,</HI>) that when <Q>the People offer'd him the Title of <HI>Lord,</HI> he re∣fused it, and thought the Title of <HI>Pater Patria</HI> more honourable</Q> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ducter. Hist.</HI> Vol. II. <HI>P.</HI> 3.4.</NOTE>, as indeed it was.</P>
<P>Now there are several Ways wherein <HI>Civil Rulers,</HI> (who are <HI>Political Fathers</HI>) may, and should mani∣fest their <HI>paternal</HI> Regards to those who are under their Authority,</P>
<P N="1">1. By their <HI>Love</HI> to them. The Love of <HI>natural Parents</HI> to their <HI>Children</HI> is exceeding great: <HI>Can a Woman forget her sucking Child</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Isal. 49.15.</NOTE>? Intimating that
<PB N="14" REF="006175_0013_102800EEDEEF6F00"/>
it is a very unlikely Thing, and next to an Impossibility, <HI>David</HI> wish'd he might have died instead of his Son <HI>Ab∣solom; Would God,</HI> says he, <HI>I had died for thee</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 18.33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And shall no Footsteps of <HI>paternal</HI> Affection be found in those who are <HI>political Fathers?</HI> Since <HI>both</HI> are stiled <HI>Fathers,</HI> may it not be justly expected, that there should be something <HI>similar</HI> in them? Certainly, <HI>civil Rulers</HI> may be look'd upon rather as <HI>Tyrants</HI> than FA∣THERS, if they be not cordial <HI>Lovers</HI> of those whom they rule over: <HI>God be gracious to thee my Son,</HI> said <HI>Joseph</HI> to his Brother <HI>Benjamin</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Gen. 43.29.</NOTE>. Which, perhaps, was spo∣ken rather as <HI>Superiours</HI> were wont to do to those below them <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Patrick</HI> in Loc.</NOTE> than because he was his near Relation; tho' it may include <HI>both.</HI> If the <HI>former</HI> be only meant, then it shews great Regard, Love and Affection, <HI>civil Rulers</HI> ought to have for those who are Subject to their Authority</P>
<P>The Truth is, if <HI>political Fathers</HI> have no <HI>real Affecti∣on</HI> for their People, 'tis not probable that there will be any <HI>mutual Confidence</HI> between them. They will always be <HI>jealous</HI> one of the other; and the <HI>One</HI> will be apt to <HI>rule as Tyrants,</HI> and the <HI>Other</HI> to <HI>obey as Slaves</HI>; because they cannot help it.</P>
<P>So that it is necessary, in order to answer the Ends of civil Government, that <HI>Rulers</HI> should behave towards their <HI>People,</HI> with the Tenderness and Affection of FA∣THERS. So did <HI>Nehemiah, David,</HI> and <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> and divers others in the <HI>first Chair of Government,</HI> which are found on Scripture Record.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="006175_0014_102803706A3DE760"/>And in <HI>the same Way,</HI> it is <HI>still</HI> the Wisdom and Duty of <HI>civil Fathers</HI> to conduct themselves towards their <HI>Peo∣ple</HI>: And if they do so indeed, doubtless they will find their Account in it, sooner or later.</P>
<P N="2">2. Civil Rulers should shew themselves <HI>Fathers</HI> to their <HI>People,</HI> by <HI>protecting</HI> them to the utmost of their Power. This they should do both in Times of <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) In a Time of <HI>War.</HI> <Q>In such a World as this is, there is no living without War</Q>; tho' the Conse∣quents of it are commonly very dreadful; <HI>every Battle of the Warriour</HI> being <HI>with confused Noise, and Gar∣ments rolled in Blood</HI> <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Isa. 9, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Therefore <HI>civil Rulers</HI> (as <HI>Fathers</HI> of their People) should do all they can, to <HI>preserve</HI> them from so great Calamity; as <HI>natural Parents,</HI> we may well suppose, would, to save their <HI>Children</HI> from Destruction. Hence 'tis their Duty to make <HI>seasonable</HI> Provision for their Safety; and this they may do, not only by using all proper Means to preserve them from the Miseries of War; but likewise by making, in Times of Peace, sui∣table <HI>Preparation</HI> for their <HI>Defence,</HI> in Case a War should happen. 'Twas prudent Advice King <HI>Asa</HI> gave his People, and well becoming a <HI>Father</HI> of his Country, <HI>Let us build these Cities, and make about them Walls, and Towers, Gates and Bars, while the Land is yet be∣fore us</HI>—<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. 14.7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Political Fathers</HI> should be careful to promote the outward Prosperity of their People in Times of Peace.
<PB N="16" REF="006175_0015_102800F6F41A2E38"/>
How much of the Spirit of a true <HI>Patriot</HI> breathed forth in these Words, which proceeded from royal Lips; and how much of the Tenderness and Affection of a <HI>Father</HI> did they discover towards his People? <HI>And</HI> David <HI>spoke unto the Lord, when he saw the Angel that smote the People, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly, but these Sheep, what have they done? Let thine Hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my Father's House</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">2 Sam 24.17.</NOTE>. As a tender <HI>Parent</HI> will hazard his own Life to save his <HI>Child's,</HI> so this good King had the Welfare of his <HI>Subjects</HI> so much at Heart, that he was even willing to redeem <HI>their</HI> Lives with the Loss of <HI>his own: These Sheep, what have they done? Let thine Hand, I pray thee, be against me.</HI></P>
<P>Civil Fathers, it may be, never act more becoming their Character, than when they manifest a true Concern for their People's <HI>Prosperity,</HI> and how they may most effectually promote it.</P>
<P>And here allow me to say, that a necessary Step to this Purpose, is to provide <HI>good Laws,</HI> and to take due Care that they be <HI>well executed</HI>; Laws that encourage In∣dustry, and are designedly calculated to put Marks of Disgrace upon the <HI>Idle</HI> and <HI>Lazy</HI>; that Children born of <HI>needy</HI> Parents, be put out to Trades, and brought up in honest <HI>Callings</HI>: Hereby the Publick, in all Probability, will, not only be eased of <HI>a Bill of Charge,</HI> but reap the <HI>Benefit</HI> of their diligent Labours. <HI>That</HI> good <HI>Order,</HI> and <HI>seasonable Hours</HI> be kept in Houses of <HI>publick Enter∣tainment</HI>; and <HI>Intemperance</HI> (the <HI>growing Iniquity</HI> of the present Age) be supprest, if possible. <HI>Especially,</HI> that the LORD'S-DAY be religiously observed, and kept
<PB N="17" REF="006175_0016_1028037202326C78"/>
as a Day of <HI>holy Rest.</HI> In a Word, <HI>that</HI> ALL <HI>Immora∣lities,</HI> of what Kind soever be discountenanced and pu∣nished.</P>
<P>And while I am speaking of these Things, I cannot pass over in Silence, the late excellent ACT made con∣cerning <HI>profane Cursing and Swearing</HI>; for which, I doubt not, all good Men are very <HI>thankful,</HI> and <HI>bless</HI> God, that he was pleased to put it into the Hearts of our <HI>honourable Rulers</HI> to make such a noble and heroic STAND against so <HI>prevailing</HI> an Iniquity.</P>
<P>And to encourage (if need be) our <HI>civil Fathers</HI> in their <HI>future Endeavours</HI> to <HI>reform</HI> the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> of this People; I would further say, that the ACT re∣ferred to, hath been thought (by those who are most likely to know) to have given a considerable <HI>Check</HI> to that <HI>bold Transgression.</HI> It were to be wish'd, that some∣thing like it <HI>had</HI> been also, or <HI>may be invented,</HI> more ef∣fectually to suppress <HI>Drunkenness; a Sin which threatens Ruin to this Land.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Civil Rulers, as <HI>Fathers</HI> of their People, should use much <HI>Prudence</HI> in exercising their Authority. It is said, concerning <HI>David,</HI> that <HI>he behaved himself wisely—and he was acceptable in the Sight of all the People, and also in the Sight of</HI> Saul's <HI>Servants</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 18.5.</NOTE>, The whole <HI>Court,</HI> it seems, admired him for his discreet Conduct: And in such a Society, to behave so as to be universally applau∣ded, is no common Thing.</P>
<P>For Want of <HI>prudent Management, Rehoboam</HI> lost the <HI>greater</HI> Part of his Subjects. Had he given them good
<PB N="18" REF="006175_0017_102800F880C79D90"/>
Words, and followed the sage Advice offered him by his grave Counsellors, the unhappy Separation that en∣sued, might (humanely speaking) have been prevented:</P>
<P>But his Conduct was such, even when his <HI>all,</HI> in a Manner (as to his Regal Authority) lay at Stake, that the worst of his Enemies could not wish him to act more foolishly than he did.</P>
<P>It was said by the old Men, who had been of his Father's Council, <HI>If thou wilt be a Servant unto this People this Day, and speak good Words to them, then they will be thy Servants forever</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 12.7.</NOTE>. But he had not the Wisdom to take their Advice, and thereupon great Confusion followed. See here, <HI>How requisite Prudence, and wise Conduct is in Civil Rulers.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. and Lastly, Civil Rulers should manifest their <HI>Paternal</HI> Care of their People, by setting before them a <HI>good Example.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis not easy to imagine what a mighty Influence a pious Ruler's Example is apt to have upon those who are under his Authority. Children, we see, have a strong Propensity to approve and practice what is done by their Parents: And the Case is much the same with Respect to <HI>Civil Fathers</HI>; THE EXAMPLE OF THE KING being a Maxim that most seem willing to conform unto.</P>
<P>Therefore it must needs have a great Tendency to promote the best Intersts of a People when their <HI>politi∣cal Fathers</HI> are Persons of eminent Piety, and bright Examples of <HI>pure and undefiled Religion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="006175_0018_102800D1C6998788"/>The Prophet <HI>Elisha</HI> would have had no Regard to the distressed Host of <HI>Israel,</HI> and those that were with them, had it not been for the Respect he bore to King <HI>Jehosaphat</HI> on the account of his great <HI>Piety; And</HI> Elisha <HI>said unto the King of</HI> Israel, <HI>What have I to do with thee?—Surely were it not that I regard the Presence of</HI> Jehosaphat, <HI>the King of</HI> Judah, I WOULD NOT LOOK TOWARD THEE, NOR SEE THEE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 3.13, 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If a People see their Rulers to be loose or profane, they will either despise them, or be too ready to imitate their bad Example; and thus their <HI>Leaders will cause them to err</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Isai. 9.16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having shewed in a few Particulars, Wherein Civil Ru∣lers should be FATHERS to their <HI>People</HI>: I come in the</P>
<P>II Place, as was proposed, to mention the <HI>Obligations</HI> they are under to <HI>be so.</HI></P>
<P>And I shall Name only Two at present,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>great Trust</HI> committed to Civil Rulers ought to be a strong Inducement to them to exert their Autho∣rity, in all proper Ways, for the Good of their People, and to carry as <HI>Fathers</HI> to them.</P>
<P><HI>Natural Fathers</HI> look upon their <HI>Off-spring</HI> to be an important Charge (as indeed it is) and therefore are willing to run all Hazards to preserve them, and to promote their Welfare.</P>
<P>And the like Concern (in some Degree) ought Civil Fathers to have for their Poople.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="006175_0019_102800FBC0477CC8"/>Thus they should carefully consult their Interest in all Respects; advise them in the best Manner they can, and upon all difficult Emergencies appear in the Gap for their Relief. Hear how <HI>Job</HI> (who doubtless had been a Man in Authority) speaks concerning himself, <HI>I delivered</HI> (says he) <HI>the Poor that cried, the Fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The Blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the Widows Heart to sing for Joy. I was Eyes to the Blind, and Feet was I to the Lame: I was a Father to the Poor, and the Cause which I knew not, I searched out: And I brake the Jaws of the Wicked, and plucked the
Spoil out of his Teeth</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Job. 29.12,—17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus to do is the surest Course Civil Rulers can take to secure to themselves the amiable Character of true <HI>Patriots.</HI> And indeed for this very End and Purpose were they appointed, and not <HI>to lord it over their Infe∣riours.</HI></P>
<P>And upon the Account of the <HI>great Trust</HI> reposed in <HI>Political Fathers,</HI> and the heavy Burden they sustain, those who are subject to their Government, ought to look on themselves as bound in Duty and Conscience to pray earnestly to God for them <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 2.1, 2.</NOTE> <Q>As for his Direction and Assistance, in the Discharge of their high Office, so likewise for his powerful Grace to preserve them from Sin and Evil, in the midst of those manifold Temptations to which they are continually exposed, in Appearance much beyond other Men, from the Heigth of that Condition, and he Extent of their Power, — and from the officious Servility of <HI>Parasites</HI> and <HI>Flatterers,,</HI> who sooth them in their Faults, and
<PB N="21" REF="006175_0020_102800CDB302DA68"/>
humour them in their Passions, and comply with their corrupt and vicious Inclinations, and are always ready at hand, and forward Instruments to execute their Commands, and to serve their Lusts and Vices.</Q> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Arch-Bp. <HI>Tillo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son,</HI> Vol. II. P.432, 433.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. If Rulers do not behave as <HI>Fathers</HI> towards their <HI>People,</HI> there is <HI>Danger</HI> of their <HI>losing the Honour, Esteem and Reverence,</HI> which otherwise they might justly expect to receive from them. The <HI>Subject</HI>'s Love is the <HI>Prime</HI>'s strongest Cittadel. If Rulers are tyrannical and cruel in their Government, they must look for no <HI>chear∣ful,</HI> but only a <HI>forc'd</HI> Submission to be paid them. If those under Authority perceive their Rulers have no <HI>paternal</HI> Concern for them, they will be apt to have but little Affection for their <HI>Civil Fathers</HI>; which must needs be productive of great Confusion and Disorder in the Body Politic: <HI>One</HI> will be jealous of the <HI>other</HI>; and when <HI>Power</HI> is visibly abused <HI>Submission</HI> will be found an hard Task.</P>
<P>That Parent who governs his Children with a prudent Lenity or Gentleness, and appears to be deeply concern∣ed for their Welfare on all Accounts, takes the surest Course to entitle himself to their sincere Respect, and to be truly honoured by them. Whereas he that is rigorous and always treats them in a churlish imperious Manner, is only <HI>slavishly feared,</HI> but not <HI>cordially loved.</HI></P>
<P>And the Case is much the same as to <HI>Political Fathers</HI>: If by <HI>them</HI> the People <HI>enjoy great Quietness, and very worthy Deeds are done unto</HI> them, by their <HI>Providence,</HI> they probably will <HI>accept of it always, with all Thank∣fulness.</HI> Sure I am, they would be liable to severe Cen∣sures
<PB N="22" REF="006175_0021_1028010014E31778"/>
if they did not. But if nothing but Frowns and Rebukes, haughty and imperious Carriage be to be ex∣pected, no wonder if such Rulers soon lose the Hearts of their People. But <HI>Beloved, I hope better Things of you,</HI> our Civil Fathers, <HI>though I thus speak.</HI></P>
<P>But there is one Thing that I must by no Means omit the mentioning of, and that is, to recommend a PUBLICK SPIRIT, which is so much wanting in <HI>this Land</HI>; and which is equally necessary to be found not only in Rulers, but the People also, in order to our be∣coming a prosperous and flourishing State. A learned Man, whose Words I have had Occasion to cite before, says, <Q>' Twas the Temper of the <HI>Romans</HI> to do and receive all they could for the Interst of the Common∣Wealth, without taking or reserving any Thing to themselves, but the Honour of serving it to the ut∣most of their Power; and as long as this Temper lasted, they prospered in all their Undertakings; but afterwards, when this <HI>Public Spirit</HI> became turned all into <HI>Self-Interest,</HI> and none served the Public but to serve <HI>themselves,</HI> by plundering it, every Thing then went backward with them as fast as it had gone for∣ward with them before, till they were soon after swal∣lowed up, first in Tyranny, and afterwards in Ruin.</Q> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prideaux</HI>'s Connect. Vol. III. P. 425.</NOTE> Thus he.</P>
<P>And elsewhere <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">P. 90.</NOTE> the same Person says, <Q>And so it must happen with all other States and Kingdoms, when the Public Interest is sacrificed to that of private Men, and the Offices and Employments of the State are desired only to gratify the Ambition, and glut the Avarice of them that can get into them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="006175_0022_102800D34DA0E058"/>If this be thought an Excursion, I hope it may prove no unuseful one, and so I leave it without further en∣larging upon it.</P>
<P>Thus I have done with the <HI>Observations</HI> raised from the Text, and shall now proceed the the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION</HEAD>
<P>In which 'tis my Purpose to be very brief.</P>
<P>Use I. Hence how great a <HI>Mercy</HI> ought a People to account it, when God gives such to rule over them who are concerned to promote their best Interests, and desirous to shew them all the Affection and Tender∣ness of kind Fathers. And such a Mercy our Nation and Land enjoy in his present MAJESTY, our <HI>Rightful and most Gracious Sovereign King</HI> GEROGE II. who, we trust, esteems it a greater Honour to be the Common Father of his Loyal Subjects, than to wear the Imperial Crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>And such, we hope, His <HI>Excellency</HI> our Commander in Chief, and all our <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> will be to <HI>this Province.</HI> And if they are indeed so, and we do not accordingly Esteem and Honour and Support them, let every Body call us ungrateful, and they cannot call us worse, or say any Thing of us that is more to our Discredit.</P>
<P>'Tis justly to be look'd upon as an high Favour when Rulers are ambitious of arriving to the Character of being <HI>Fathers</HI> to their People. All Things in the <HI>State</HI> will then probably be carried on with much Ease and Unanimity; <HI>Rulers</HI> will not grasp after <HI>more</HI> Power than properly belongs to them, nor the <HI>People</HI> be under a Temptation to wish it <HI>less</HI> than it is.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="006175_0023_102801019C405C60"/>And thus there will be an admirable Harmony be∣tween Rulers and Ruled, which is the Beauty and Glory of all Communities both civil and sacred.</P>
<P>Use II. Are Rulers Civil FATHERS? Then 'tis our Duty to <HI>honour</HI> them <HI>as such</HI>; and not with a curious or (which is much worse) a malicious Eye, to pry into their Failings (which none are without) and magnify them beyond what they really are. Those of lower Rank know little of the Cares and Burden of <HI>Govern∣ment.</HI> <Q>Whatever ambitious and inconsiderate Men may think (says one) wise Men do certainly <HI>know</HI> and find by Experience, that to discharge all the Parts of a good <HI>Governour</HI> is a very difficult and trouble∣some Province. Inferiour Magistrates (as he goes on) find Care and Trouble enough, in that small Share and Part of it which they sustain; and if so, then certainly the Care and Concernment of the <HI>whole</HI> must needs be a heavy Burden indeed. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Abp. <HI>Tillot.</HI> Vol. II. P. 432.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Therefore, instead of <HI>Murmuring</HI> and <HI>Railing</HI> at our Civil Fathers, we ought to pity and pray for them, to <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> them; and as much as we can to encourage them in their faithful Endeavours to serve the Public, as they did <HI>Ezra; Arise, for this Matter belongeth unto thee,</HI> WE ALSO WILL BE WITH THEE: <HI>Be of good Courage and do it</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ezra 10.4.</NOTE> And to put Marks of great Respect upon them, when they are seen to have the Public Good much at Heart, and to be true Friends to Religion, and the Interest of CHRIST'S Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="006175_0024_102800D66881BC58"/>Use III. Lastly, Let what we have heard be a persuasive Motive to our Civil Rulers to be indeed FATHERS to the People of <HI>this Province.</HI></P>
<P>And here in the first Place, Duty obliges me to address myself to YOUR EXCELLENCY, our chief civil <HI>Father</HI> under the KING.</P>
<P>I have no Design nor Inclination to flatter <HI>Your Excellency,</HI> and if I had, I suppose YOU are as much above it, as I am sure it is beneath an honest Mind to attempt it.</P>
<P>Nor would I be unmannerly in my Address to a civil Father in the <HI>first Chair of Government.</HI> If I may be so happy as to avoid both these Extreams, and yet be faithful, I shall reach the Point I aim at.</P>
<P>Suffer me then, <HI>Excellent</HI> SIR, with all suitable Re∣spect to say, That as YOU are intrusted by our com∣mon FATHER, the KING, with the Government of the People of this Province (dear, I hope, To God) so 'tis their general Expectation, I believe, that <HI>Your Excellency</HI> would please to consider, how great an Opportunity is hereby put into your Hands to be a <HI>Father</HI> to us all; not only by consulting our tempo∣ral Interest; but, which is of much greater Impor∣tance, by promoting pure and undefiled Religion a∣mong us.</P>
<P>Those who have been your Predecessors, in your present exalted Station, have done worthily, and greatly in their Day; and 'tis, I doubt not, the unanimous Wish of this People, that YOU may <HI>excell them</HI> ALL.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="006175_0025_1028010468241F80"/>And now need I put <HI>Your Excellency</HI> in Mind, how much it will induce to your own Ease and Quiet, in your Government, to countenance and encourage Vertue and Religion among your People, as well as to be a bright Example of the same YOUR SELF! For (as a great and wise Man says) <Q>How can it be ex∣pected, from <HI>that Man,</HI> who dares affront and despise God <HI>himself,</HI> that he should have any hearty <HI>Reverence</HI> for his <HI>Deputies</HI> and <HI>Vicegerents</HI></Q> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Bp. <HI>Wilkins</HI> Princip. Nat. Relig. P. 297.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>Need I use Importunity with <HI>Your Excellency,</HI> to improve your Interest in the Court of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as there shall be Occasion, on Behalf of this <HI>Province.</HI></P>
<P>Your <HI>Excellency's past Sollicitations</HI> for us, have shewn <HI>You</HI> to be a true <HI>Patriot,</HI> and may <HI>You</HI> ever be so.</P>
<P>Or, Need I bespeak your <HI>paternal</HI> Care for the SCHOOL <HI>of the Prophets,</HI> which is <HI>the Glory</HI> of <HI>New∣England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Your Excellency</HI> knows too well the Advantage of a <HI>liberal Education</HI> to discourage <HI>Learning,</HI> and there∣fore, 'tis hop'd, you will continue to be a kind <HI>Pa∣tron</HI> to that <HI>learned Body.</HI> The <HI>Governours</HI> and <HI>Heads</HI> of that <HI>Society</HI> are at <HI>present,</HI> and may they ever be, Persons of Prudence, Piety and good <HI>Literature</HI>; and while they are <HI>such,</HI> there is no good Ruler but will think it his Duty to be a <HI>Father</HI> to them.</P>
<P>As to <HI>inferiour Schools,</HI> I need not (indeed I can∣not) say more than has been already urged upon that Head, by others who have gone before me.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="006175_0026_102800DE17839F70"/>To close then my Address to <HI>Your Excellency</HI>; May God by his Grace, enable <HI>You to serve Your Generation,</HI> in the high Station you are, <HI>according to his Will</HI>; May you be able to appeal to Him in your last Moments, in the same Manner that the excellent <HI>Cyrus</HI> did, <Q>Thou knowest (said he then) That I have been a Lover of Mankind, and now that I am leaving this World, I hope to find that Mercy from thee, which I have shewed to others</Q>.</P>
<P>The hearty Prayer of all good Men for <HI>Your Ex∣cellency,</HI> I doubt not is, That you may at last <HI>sleep in</HI> JESUS, and <HI>your Rest in him be glorious.</HI></P>
<P>I now turn my self to the honourable His <HI>Ma∣jesty's</HI> COUNCIL, and the Gentlemen of the honoura∣ble House of REPRESENTATIVES;</P>
<P>To the Former, (by whose <HI>Appointment,</HI> in Con∣junction with his <HI>Excellency</HI>'s, I stand here <HI>to Day</HI>) I would humbly suggest, that the very <HI>Title</HI> you wear, <HI>His Majesty's Council!</HI> should be a powerful Motive to engage you to consult, according to the best of your Skill and Judgment, the Affairs of the Pro∣vince, and all the valuable Interests of it; and to give the wisest Advice you are able, under our pre∣sent difficult and perplexed Circumstances. Let your <HI>Counsel</HI> have no Mixture, no Alloy of <HI>selfish Views,</HI> but mainly aim at the Good of the <HI>Publick.</HI> We have been almost <HI>undone</HI> by the Prevalency of a <HI>pri∣vate, self-seeking Spirit</HI>; may it no more be found a∣mong us: Especially, may <HI>you,</HI> who are <HI>civil Fathers,</HI> excell in <HI>publick Spiritedness,</HI> and teach us all by your Example, to be ambitious of the same excellent Cha∣racter.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="006175_0027_1028010621A8DA10"/>To the Gentlemen who represent the Province, I would only say; do you need to be put in Mind, how great a Trust is reposed in you by your Con∣stituents; and what an Influence the Choice of Coun∣sellors to be made this Day (chiefly by your selves) may have upon the Government?</P>
<P>Let not then the Business of the Day seem as a light Matter or trifling Concern to any of you. Re∣member that your Trust is great (as I intimated but now) and that both God and Man expect you dis∣charge it faithfully.</P>
<P>There is one Thing, though it may seem a little out of the Way to mention it here, yet in as much as it is so great a Frown of Providence upon us all, and so much damps our publick Joy <HI>this Day,</HI> I can't but name it, and that is the Destruction of our <HI>State-House</HI> by Fire, which we may still behold lying all in Ruins. May we be duly affected therewith, and <HI>bewail the burning which the</HI> LORD <HI>hath kindled.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed,</P>
<P>As to those who are in the <HI>Ministry</HI>: 'Tis need∣less now to take up the Time in an Address to <HI>them,</HI> since that will be particularly done To-morrow by a much abler Hand.</P>
<P>To the <HI>People in general,</HI> I have only this com∣prehensive Word to offer, <HI>Be dutiful and obedient to your Civil Fathers, and at Peace among yourselves.</HI> Forget not the Words of our blessed Saviour, <HI>Every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to Desola∣tion</HI>;
<PB N="29" REF="006175_0028_102800D4D4884190"/>
<HI>and every City or House divided against itself shall not stand</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Matth. 12.25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>No Republic ever excelled <HI>Rome</HI> in profound Polity <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ducter.</HI> Hist. Vol. II. P. 235.</NOTE>. But notwithstanding this, <HI>She carried in her own Breast the Cause of her Ruin,</HI> in the per∣petual <HI>Jealousy</HI> of the People against the Senate, or rather of the <HI>Plebeians</HI> against the <HI>Patritii</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The <HI>one</HI> alledging always, That Excess of Liberty would at last destroy itself; and the <HI>others</HI> fear just the contrary, That Authority, which in own Nature was always for encreasing, would last degenerate into Tyranny.

Idem,</HI> P. 236.</NOTE></Q> O then let all <HI>Jealousy</HI> between <HI>Rulers</HI> and <HI>Ruled</HI> be laid aside, and extinguished forever.</P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers, Let Him not leave us, nor forsake us. — And the Lord maintain the Cause of his People at all Times, as the Matter shall require.</HI> AMEN.</P>
