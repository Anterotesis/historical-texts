<HEAD>AN ESSAY To revive <HI>Military Exercises,</HI> Skill and Valour.</HEAD>

<P>Also he had them teach the Children of Judah the Use of the Bow.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the latter part of this Chapter, we have a mournful and yet manly <HI>Poem,</HI> which was composed by <HI>David</HI>; who was not only a <HI>mighty valiant Man, a man of War,</HI> but also <HI>the sweet Psalmist of Is∣rael,</HI> an <HI>accomplished Poet,</HI> and one that could <HI>play well on an Instrument.</HI></P>
<P>HE wrote this <HI>Military Elegy,</HI> on the mournful Occasion of the overthrow and daughter of some of the People of the Lord,
<PB N="6" REF="003589_0004_0FF833BF6260CFD0"/>
and particularly the <HI>tragical Death</HI> of <HI>Saul King of Israel,</HI> and his <HI>beloved Jonathan the King's Son.</HI>—</P>
<P>There was <HI>War</HI> between the <HI>Philistines,</HI> who were a <HI>valiant warlike People,</HI> and the <HI>Children of Israel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saul the King, (as becomes a brave General</HI>) led forth his Armies himself to the War: He marched and (as we may suppose) <HI>fought</HI> at the head of his <HI>armed Soldiers:</HI> He also took his <HI>Sons</HI> with him into the <HI>Camp</HI> and <HI>Field of Battle,</HI> and met the Forces of the <HI>Philistines.</HI></P>
<P>There ensued a <HI>bloody Battle</HI> between these <HI>gallant Armies</HI>: and alas! <HI>the Race is not to the swift, nor the Battle to the strong.</HI></P>
<P>The Armies of the uncircumcised prevailed and got the Day, and <HI>Israel fled before them, and fell down slain on the Mountains of Gilboa.</HI> 1 Sam. 31. <HI>begin.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Philistines</HI> well knowing how to pur∣sue an Advantage, followed after <HI>Israel,</HI> and slew the <HI>valiant</HI> and <HI>worthy Sons</HI> of the King, even <HI>Jonathan, Abinadab,</HI> and <HI>Malchishua</HI>; and they wounded <HI>Saul</HI> the Lord's anointed with an <HI>Arrow.</HI></P>
<P>Now when <HI>Saul</HI> saw the downfall of his heroic Sons, and many of his valiant Sol∣diers, the overthrow of his Armies, and him∣self wounded, and had in vain, asked his Armour-bearer to put an end to his Life, and so to his Anguish and Misery, he fell on his
<PB N="7" REF="003589_0005_0FF833C15942BC60"/>
own Sword and died, <HI>as if he had not been anointed with Oyl</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 31 4.5. &amp; 11. v. of the Context.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the News of this was brought to <HI>David</HI> in <HI>Zicklag,</HI> by a young <HI>Amalekite, David and the Men that were with him rent their Cloths, and they mourned and wept and fasted until evening, for</HI> Saul <HI>and for</HI> Jonathan <HI>his Son, and for the People of the Lord, and for the House of Israel, because they were fallen by the Sword.</HI> Verse 11 &amp; 12 of our Context.</P>
<P>And when <HI>David</HI> had done Justice on the <HI>Amalekite,</HI> and was retired, he gave further Vent to his noble Passions, in this mournful and yet sublime <HI>Funeral Song,</HI> at the begin∣ning of which stand the Words of our Text.</P>
<P>In which he celebrates the <HI>Military Accom∣plishments</HI> and <HI>Atchievements</HI> of these <HI>Heroes,</HI> and laments their Death.</P>
<P>The Elegy is intirely <HI>Military,</HI> as one ob∣serves <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. <HI>Symmes,</HI> in his <HI>Level lamented.</HI></NOTE>, and 'tis plain the design of it was, to fire the Ambition of the <HI>Militia</HI> of <HI>Judah,</HI> and stir up in them a <HI>Martial</HI> Spirit, to quick∣en them by <HI>Military Exercises,</HI> to endeavour to <HI>excel in warlike Skill and Accomplishments</HI>; that they might equal and excel the Skill and Valour of those Worthies, and rise up in their stead, and boldly carry on the <HI>War</HI> a∣gainst their Enemies, and avenge the Death of their <HI>King,</HI> his Sons, and the other valiant
<PB N="8" REF="003589_0006_0FF833C2E5EAA270"/>
Soldiers that fell with them; and retrieve the Honour and Credit they had lost by this overthrow.</P>
<P>Agreably,</P>
<P>In the Text, he <HI>bad them teach the Chil∣dren of Judah the Use of the Bow.</HI></P>
<P><Q>This, as <HI>Junius</HI> observes, expresses the Design of <HI>David,</HI> that this Song might ex∣cite and provoke them to addict themselves to Martial Exercises, and to acquire Skill in the <HI>use of the Bow,</HI> which is here put for all warlike Weapons then in Fashion.</Q></P>
<P>And for the same Reason and with the same View he tells them, that <HI>good Soldiers</HI> are the <HI>Beauty of Israel</HI>; he minds them of the Valour, of the Honour and Success of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and mentions other things in the Elegy.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> was now upon the Death of <HI>Saul,</HI> not only <HI>Generalissimo of the Forces of Israel,</HI> and <HI>Captain of the Lord's Hosts,</HI> but the <HI>King of Israel,</HI> tho' not yet in possession of the <HI>Throne</HI> by the Act of <HI>Coronation.</HI></P>
<P>And notwithstanding his Mourning, he was not forgetful of his Duty, nor unmindful of the Safety and Felicity, the Honour and Reputation of his Kingdom and People.</P>
<P>But at the same time that he publishes this Song, he sends forth this wise and proper <HI>Order</HI> and Command, or publishes this <HI>Law</HI> (as one calls it) therewith, to the Officers of the <HI>Troops</HI> and <HI>trained Bands,</HI> and to all o∣thers
<PB N="9" REF="003589_0007_0FF833C56B02A2A8"/>
concerned in those Affairs in the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI>; (as I may have occasion to ob∣serve hereafter) that they should take care that the Soldiers should be taught the Art, Skill and Practice of War, the Use of <HI>Martial Weapons.</HI></P>
<P>He that writes this History mentions this <HI>Order,</HI> as he enters on the Recitation of the <HI>Song,</HI> to the Honour of this great <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>And I think our Text may well be under∣stood <HI>in this Sense,</HI> both because of the Con∣nection &amp; Design of this Story and <HI>Elegy,</HI> and because of the Idiom and Phrase of the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> (as far as I can judge of it) tho' there are great Men that suppose this Expression, <HI>He bad them teach the Children of Judah the Bow,</HI> means, he bad them teach them this <HI>Song,</HI> to which he prefixes the Title, <HI>Kasheth,</HI> or the <HI>Bow.</HI></P>
<P>I can't satisfy my self with that Exposi∣tion; but allowing it, yet even the Patrons of it, allow the Poem to have the same View and Design, and so the former Sense is still good; and having good Authority on my side, I may be allowed to take my Text in that Sense.</P>
<P>And understanding it so, we may observe here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>First, Who it was, and what Character he sustained, who issued out this Order or Command.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'twas the <HI>valiant and expert David,</HI> (who as was said) tho' taken from the Sheep∣folds
<PB N="10" REF="003589_0008_0FF833C761F607E0"/>
of his Father in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam 16.11. &amp; 2 Sam. 7.8.</NOTE>, was yet a very brave couragious and skilful Soldier; he had approved himself such an one, not only in the <HI>celebrated Action</HI> of slaying <HI>Goliah,</HI> the Champion of the <HI>Philistines, who was a man of war from his Youth,</HI> when <HI>David</HI> was but a <HI>stripling</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 17 chap.</NOTE>, but also in bringing in two hundred Foreskins of the <HI>Philistines</HI> at ano∣ther Time <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 18.22.</NOTE>, and now in the Slaughter of the <HI>Amalekites</HI> <NOTE N="†{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 30 chap.</NOTE>, and many other noble Ex∣ploits which he had done.</P>
<P>And he was now the <HI>Captain General</HI> of the standing Forces of <HI>Israel,</HI> and the King instead of <HI>Saul.</HI> It was this <HI>great Master of the Art of War,</HI> and chief Commander, that gave forth his Command to teach his Soldi∣ers, his Subjects, the <HI>Military Art.</HI></P>
<P>And with what Propriety and Authority a Command comes from such an one! how chearfully will it be received and obeyed by Officers and Soldiers!</P>
<P><HI>Generals</HI> and <HI>Captains</HI> should be good <HI>Sol∣diers.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly, Observe here, to whom this Or∣der was sent.</HI></P>
<P>And it plainly appears that it was not primarily to <HI>Common Soldiers</HI>; but it was ei∣ther to the <HI>Magistrates</HI> of <HI>Judah,</HI> in whose power it was, <HI>by the King's Approbation,</HI> to make and execute the <HI>Martial Laws</HI>;</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003589_0009_0FF833E729086CD0"/>Or to such Parents as had Sons capable of learning the <HI>Art of War,</HI> and able to go forth to <HI>War</HI>: Or rather to the <HI>Officers of the Armies,</HI> the <HI>Colonels, Captains, Lieutenants,</HI> and the like. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>vid.</HI> Poli Synop. in loc.</NOTE> <HI>Praefecti rei Militaris,</HI> says a Critick; the Officers, or those that had the oversight of Military Affairs.</P>
<P>These were presumed to be able to teach others, and received <HI>Orders</HI> agreably.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly, Observe in the Text, the Persons to be taught,</HI> viz. the <HI>Children of Judah, the Sons of Judah,</HI> as in the Original: The young and effective Men, who were suitable to be taught this Art.</P>
<P><HI>Judah</HI> was the <HI>Tribe</HI> to which <HI>David</HI> be∣longed; and his chief Dependance was upon them for Martial Exploits, and for Constancy and Fidelity to their Prince: They were also a professing and religious People.</P>
<P><HI>They</HI> must then be first taught the <HI>Art of War</HI>; not that the other Tribes were to be neglected; a General will have his own Company good Soldiers.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Observe here, the <HI>Order, Com∣mand</HI> or Law it self; <HI>Teach them the Bow,</HI> or, the Use of the Bow. Some, tho' not all Ex∣positors, think this well supplied in our Translation, by adding the Words the <HI>Use of,</HI> and the <HI>Bow</HI> was a Martial Weapon, much used in those Days. <HI>Jonathan</HI> is celebrated
<PB N="12" REF="003589_0010_0FF833C8ED8C6298"/>
in this <HI>Poem</HI> for his Skill in the use of it, and the Exploits he had done by it. He had before this, his <HI>Artillery</HI> and <HI>Bow.</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 20.40.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> himself doubtless well understood it; and the <HI>Philistines</HI> were very expert and successful in the use of it. By this they gained the Victory just before mentioned o∣ver <HI>Israel</HI>: With the <HI>Bow</HI> they slew <HI>Saul</HI> and his Sons.</P>
<P>'Tis possible <HI>Archery</HI> was not so much in use now among the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> as it had been; partly because of the <HI>glorious Vic∣tory David</HI> had lately obtained over <HI>Goliah</HI> with a <HI>Sling</HI> and <HI>Stone,</HI> and partly because <HI>Slings</HI> were <HI>cheaper.</HI></P>
<P>But this was not out of Use; for some of them who <HI>came to David to Zicklag, who were mighty Men, and helpers of the War,</HI> were arm∣ed with <HI>Bows</HI> as well as <HI>Slings,</HI> 1 Chron. 12.1, 2.</P>
<P>But on this Occasion, that they might not be inferiour to their Enemies in any part of <HI>Military Skill,</HI> or the use of any Weapon, and that they might fight and overcome the Ene∣mies with their own Weapons, they were to be taught a more exact and perfect Skill in the <HI>use of the Bow.</HI></P>
<P>Or as is generally thought, by <HI>Bow</HI> here is meant all <HI>Military Instruments,</HI> and so the Command is in general, teach them all the <HI>Art of War,</HI> and the use of every <HI>warlike Weapon,</HI> but <HI>especially such as will be of most
<PB N="13" REF="003589_0011_0FF833CAE543EEA8"/>
Advantage to fight against the bloody Philistines,</HI> and enable them to avenge the Death of their <HI>King,</HI> and the other brave <HI>Soldiers</HI> that fell with him.</P>
<P>This experienced <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Commander</HI> knew very well of how much Importance it was to have a <HI>well disciplined Army,</HI> of such as were <HI>expert and skilful</HI> in the use of all <HI>Martial Weapons,</HI> to meet, fight and vanquish an Enemy that was such.</P>
<P>And 'tis not impossible but some defect of <HI>Discipline</HI> and <HI>Skill</HI> among the Soldiers of <HI>Judah,</HI> or some dejection of Spirits on this Overthrow, might excite him the more at this Time to give out this <HI>Command.</HI></P>
<P>And what was then reasonable, honourable and beautiful among a People, is so now. If valiant and accomplished Soldiers were the Beauty and Safety of a People then, they are so in our Days.</P>
<P>In further speaking to these Words, I shall (by Divine Help) briefly consider these three Things, (which naturally offer themselves to our Thoughts) <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>It is very desirable, and what God's People ought to take care of, that their</HI> Sons <HI>be taught and trained up in the</HI> Military Art and Skill; <HI>or that they be</HI> expert, accomplished and valiant Soldiers.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>I shall consider what Influence the Example in our Text may have on those who have (in our Days) the</HI> Command <HI>of the</HI> Mili∣tia. <HI>And</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003589_0012_0FF833CC7471C418"/>Thirdly, <HI>That it is desirable that a People be taught</HI> that Manner of warring, <HI>and Skill in using those</HI> Weapons of War, <HI>which may be of most Service against the Enemies they have most Apprehensions from.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I am to consider, that 'tis very desi∣rable, and what God's People ought to take care of, that their <HI>Sons</HI> be taught and trained up in the <HI>Military Art and Skill</HI>; or, that they be <HI>expert, accomplished and valiant Sol∣diers.</HI></P>
<P>We see this was one of the very first things this wise and prudent <HI>King</HI> took care of, af∣ter he became <HI>King,</HI> to give Orders that his Subjects should bring up their <HI>Sons</HI> in <HI>Mili∣tary Exercises,</HI> that they should teach them the <HI>Martial Art,</HI> and the use of <HI>warlike Wea∣pons.</HI> He would have their <HI>young Men early</HI> taught it, and all grow more dexterous at it.</P>
<P>And he puts into their Hands at the same Time this <HI>Poem,</HI> not only to eternise the Me∣mory of his <HI>Heroes,</HI> but to <HI>fire</HI> their <HI>martial Courage,</HI> and stir them up to Emulation, and to fill them with desires of acquiring the <HI>Ho∣nour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> which belongs to <HI>skilful</HI> and <HI>brave Soldiers.</HI></P>
<P>Agreably he gives this <HI>Command,</HI> as we may suppose, not only to <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Field-Officers,</HI> but to the <HI>Civil Rulers,</HI> and to those <HI>Parents</HI> that had <HI>Sons</HI> fit to be educated therein, as I have above observed.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003589_0013_0FF833CF5E779750"/>And there is as much Reason why our Sons at this Day should be taught this <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Art,</HI> as there was in the Days of <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>We have seen and felt by unhappy Expe∣rience, that a People's Enjoyment of Gospel Privileges, is no effectual Security against <HI>E∣nemies</HI> and <HI>Wars</HI>: The Time is not (we may fear) yet come, when <HI>Men may beat their Swords into Plow shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks; that Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither shall they learn War any more</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 2.4. Mica. 4.3. § 110 Psal.</NOTE>. Nor may we expect it will, till Men will be effectually perswaded in the day of <HI>Christ's Power,</HI> to lay down the Wea∣pons of their Rebellion against the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> and <HI>list</HI> chearfully under the <HI>Banner</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> the great Captain of our <HI>Salvation</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.10.</NOTE>; and become his obedient and loyal Subjects, and <HI>good Soldiers.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is the <HI>Profession of Religion</HI> in the least inconsistent with a <HI>Military Spirit,</HI> and the <HI>Art of War</HI>: The most holy and wise of all Men have practiced War, and have been famous for their Valour and Atchievements therein, as <HI>Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David</HI> and others; and this Command was given to <HI>Ju∣dah,</HI> God's own People. Further, the Life of a Christian is compared to a <HI>Warfare,</HI> and we are commanded to put on the <HI>Armour of God</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Eph. 6 11.</NOTE>, and to be good <HI>Soldiers</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> <NOTE N="†{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2, 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003589_0014_0FF833D14E98C548"/>Neither is this unseasonable at this Day; altho' thro' the abundant Goodness of <HI>GOD,</HI> by his Blessing on the wise <HI>Counsels</HI> and well ordered <HI>Negotiations</HI> of the <HI>best of Kings, our renowned and most rightful and gracious Sove∣reign GEORGE,</HI> there is now <HI>Peace</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> for which we bless GOD with all our Hearts.</P>
<P>Nor because, by the <HI>Blessing of God</HI> on the <HI>wise Administrations</HI> and <HI>prudent Managements</HI> of the <HI>Honourable Legislature</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> we have <HI>Peace</HI> in our <HI>Borders</HI> at present, and some prospect of its continuance. <HI>Solomon</HI> had, and took care to have, <HI>Men of War, trained expert and valiant Soldiers,</HI> even in his <HI>peaceful Reign.</HI> 1 King. 9.22. Cant. 3.7, 8.</P>
<P>And who can tell what Changes there are in the right Hand of the <HI>Most High?</HI> or how soon we may again hear the <HI>Alarm of War,</HI> and be called forth to the <HI>Field of Battle</HI>?</P>
<P>If we consider our Backslidings from, and our provoking Sins against <HI>God,</HI> we shall see but little Reason to hope for a long series of <HI>Peace and Prosperity.</HI> And if we view the Actions and warlike Preparations of a <HI>Na∣tion,</HI> who seem to make Peace only to gain Time to prepare for War; if we see what they are doing even within the <HI>Limits</HI> of our own <HI>Province</HI> (as is supposed) and then con∣sider the Principles that act them with re∣spect to us, whom they call <HI>Hereticks,</HI> tho' falsly, and the <HI>Incendiaries</HI> which are among them, I believe all will allow, that this is
<PB N="17" REF="003589_0015_0FF833D2DD4C0BB8"/>
not a Time to let the <HI>Military Spirit</HI> &amp; <HI>Skill</HI> intirely die and come to nothing among us; to let our <HI>Swords</HI> rust in their Scabbords, and our <HI>Guns</HI> grow unfit for Service, and be in∣tirely uncapable on any Occasion to take up Arms, or have no Men that know how to handle or use Arms.</P>
<P>And I hope that an ESSAY to revive Martial Exercises, Skill and Valour among us, will not be thought unseasonable, nor be unacceptable, (tho' coming from the <HI>most un∣qualified of Christ's Ministers</HI>) since I am called to such a Service on this Occasion.</P>
<P>It appears then, that even in our <HI>Days</HI> and <HI>Land,</HI> God's People ought to take care to have their <HI>Sons</HI> taught the Military <HI>Art.</HI></P>
<P>And perhaps there is as much need that such a Command as our Text should be giv∣en to the <HI>Field Officers</HI> and to the <HI>Parents</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> as ever there was to any Peo∣ple: For where ever was the <HI>Martial Spirit</HI> and <HI>Skill,</HI> and <HI>Military Exercises</HI> at a lower Ebb, than among us? and where ever was there a People that appeared less concerned about their own Defence and Safety, than we in general are? Unless it were the Men of <HI>Laish,</HI> who became an easy <HI>Prey</HI> to their E∣nemies. <HI>Judg.</HI> 18.27.</P>
<P>And where ever was there a People more envied and maligned by other Nations than we are, except <HI>Israel</HI>?</P>
<P>It would be a most beautiful and desirea∣ble
<PB N="18" REF="003589_0016_0FF833D4D827F1D8"/>
thing, to see a <HI>Military Spirit</HI> revive a∣mong us; and how necessary this may be found we know not, but may be too late convinced by the unhappy Consequents of the want of it. How delightful and desirable it is to have our Sons, <HI>Sons of Valour and Re∣nown,</HI> expert and brave Soldiers, our <HI>Officers</HI> becoming their <HI>Posts,</HI> and honoured in them. And as our Security gives Vigour and Cou∣rage to our Enemies, this would curb their Pride and damp their Spirits, and the <HI>Terror</HI> of our <HI>Arms</HI> might force them to be at Peace with us. We have seen something of this, by the happy Consequents of the valiant and heroic Exploits of our late brave Captain <HI>LOVEWELL,</HI> and his worthy <HI>Company,</HI> whose <HI>Death</HI> we still lament, and whose <HI>Me∣mory</HI> is precious, and ought to be immortal.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Sons</HI> then should be acquainted with <HI>Military Exercises,</HI> and learn the <HI>Art of War</HI>; their Hands should be taught to War, and their Fingers to fight. <HI>Psal.</HI> 144.1.

Commanders,</HI> and also when to <HI>charge</HI> on their Enemies with Advantage; what <HI>Ground</HI> to choose, when to <HI>advance,</HI> and when to <HI>re∣treat</HI>; how also to <HI>Encamp,</HI> and how to de∣fend themselves by <HI>Intrenchments</HI>; how to <HI>Fortify</HI> our <HI>Castles, Forts</HI> and <HI>Garrisons,</HI> and how to <HI>besiege</HI> those of our Enemies, and <HI>bat∣ter</HI> down their <HI>Walls,</HI> and <HI>break their Ram∣parts,</HI> and how to <HI>pursue</HI> an <HI>Advantage</HI> once gained, and all other proper <HI>Stratagems</HI> of War.</P>
<P>They should be instructed how to <HI>furbish</HI> their <HI>Swords,</HI> and keep all their <HI>Arms</HI> fit for Service; and how to endure <HI>Hardness as good Soldiers.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, their <HI>Martial Fire</HI> should be <HI>kindled and blown up,</HI> and they should learn to be cautious of running into <HI>needless Dangers,</HI> but yet when there is need, to <HI>despise Dan∣ger, and face their Enemies without Fear or Cow∣ardise,</HI> and <HI>boldly to jeopard their Lives unto the Death,</HI> (like <HI>Deborah's</HI> Soldiers, <HI>Judges,</HI> Chap. 5.) <HI>in the high places of the Field,</HI> when called to <HI>fight the Battles of the LORD, to fight for their Lives, Liberties, Religion, and Cities and People of their GOD.</HI> But</P>
<P>I am not here to teach the <HI>Art of War,</HI> nor to enumerate the several parts of it, but to shew that Soldiers are to be taught all the parts thereof; and this is what a People ought to take care to see accomplished.— And I shall say but few Words for the proof
<PB N="20" REF="003589_0018_0FF833D94326F220"/>
of this, and that principally agreable to my Text and Context.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st Reason</HI> And first, <HI>A People should do this, because such</HI> Soldiers <HI>are the Beauty of a People.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>David</HI> begins this Martial Song with <HI>this,</HI> the <HI>Beauty of Israel is slain upon the high places,</HI> v. 19 of our Context. The Beauty of <HI>Israel,</HI> i. e. the <HI>expert and valiant Soldiers</HI> of <HI>Israel▪ Good Soldiers,</HI> as one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Symmes.</NOTE> hence observes, are no small part of the <HI>Beauty</HI> of God's <HI>Is∣rael.</HI> Such Soldiers are <HI>beautiful</HI> in them∣selves, <HI>valuable, honourable,</HI> and <HI>highly to be esteemed.</HI> How mean and despicable doth a Nation appear, without a <HI>disciplined and cou∣ragious Soldiery?</HI> What a <HI>Figure</HI> did <HI>Laish</HI> make, compared with the Armies of <HI>Israel?</HI> And how awful was the Time in <HI>Israel,</HI> when there was <HI>War in the Gates,</HI> and yet not a <HI>Sword</HI> nor <HI>Spear seen among forty thousand!</HI> and if there had, yet perhaps not one that could use them. <HI>Judg</HI> 5.8. Tho' an <HI>Army with Ban∣ners,</HI> which implies <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Order,</HI> is <HI>terrible</HI> to Enemies, yet 'tis beautiful and pleasant to those for whose Defence and Safety 'tis en∣gaged.</P>
<P>Now undoubtedly it becomes a People to countenance and encourage what is beauti∣ful and honourable among them.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d. Reason.</HI> The <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> of a
<PB N="21" REF="003589_0019_0FF833DACF225808"/>
People, <HI>under God,</HI> depends very much on a <HI>skilful, valiant and disciplined Militia.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' <HI>David</HI> trusted not in his <HI>Bow</HI> nor <HI>Sword</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 44.6.</NOTE>, but on <HI>God</HI> for Safety, yet under <HI>God</HI> he trusted to his <HI>Armies,</HI> his <HI>skilful and valiant Soldiers.</HI> What can an <HI>unskilful</HI> and <HI>cowardly</HI> People do, if an Enemy come against them well <HI>disciplined</HI> and <HI>armed</HI>? Tho' our Hope must be in <HI>God,</HI> and our Dependance on <HI>him</HI> for <HI>Salvation,</HI> yet we must make use of the best and most proper and probable Means: And it may be truly said, that our <HI>Lives,</HI> our <HI>Liberties,</HI> our <HI>Religion,</HI> and the <HI>safety</HI> of our <HI>Wives</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> and all that is dear to us, in a great measure depends on <HI>skilful</HI> and <HI>valiant Soldiers.</HI> Such a <HI>Militia</HI> often prevents <HI>Wars</HI>; but if it doth not prevent them, yet it keeps the Enemies in fear, and at a Distance, and it must be owned to be of unspeakable Service in a <HI>Day of Battle:</HI> Sure∣ly 'tis then desireable, and what any People should think themselves concerned in, to have such a Soldiery among them.</P>
<P>Further to confirm <HI>this,</HI> I may add, were this not desireable, King <HI>David</HI> would not have taken so much Care and Pains to en∣courage it; neither would the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> have left his Example on Record in sacred Writ for our Imitation. Neither further, would <HI>good Soldiers</HI> have been mentioned with such
<PB N="22" REF="003589_0020_0FF833DC5D6BBD00"/>
distinguishing Marks of Honour thro' the whole Scriptures.</P>
<P>Further, this is evident, in that <HI>God</HI> himself is pleased to take the <HI>Titles</HI> of, <HI>A Man of War</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 15.3. Psal. 24.</NOTE>, the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> and the <HI>Lord God strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle</HI>: And also to claim the Honour of teaching this <HI>Art,</HI> Psal. 144.1. forecited; and in that our Savi∣our appears in the Form of a glorious Captain of the Lord's Host, <HI>Josh.</HI> 5.13, 14. and 6.2. and at another Time on a <HI>red Horse</HI> in his <HI>Martial Glory,</HI> Zech. 1.8. But this is so evi∣dent in it self, and has been so fully and ela∣borately proved by such as have stood here before me on like <HI>Occasions,</HI> that I need say no more under this general Head.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I proceed now Secondly to consi∣der, as I proposed, <HI>What Influence the Exam∣ple in our Text may have on those who have (in our Day) the Command of the Militia.</HI></P>
<P>And our Text seems to have a double Aspect.</P>
<P N="1">1. First, <HI>The King's Example may refer to such as are honoured by God, so as to be placed at the head of the Militia.</HI></P>
<P>And as to them I may <HI>humbly</HI> say, Will they not be pleased to use their <HI>Influence and Authority</HI> to encourage <HI>Military Exercises,</HI> and so to revive a <HI>Martial Spirit</HI> and Skill in the <HI>Art of War,</HI> among the Children of God's Peo∣ple?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="003589_0021_0FF833DF43D01EB8"/>By honouring and countenancing such <HI>Exer∣cises</HI> with their Presence, as they see meet; <HI>by</HI> endeavouring that <HI>good Laws</HI> be made and provided for the <HI>Militia,</HI> and properly exe∣cuted. And</P>
<P>By advancing such Persons to the <HI>Honour</HI> of bearing <HI>Commissions</HI> under <HI>Them,</HI> as are every way <HI>qualified</HI> and <HI>accomplished</HI> therefor: Men that will honour <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>King,</HI> and main∣tain the <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of their <HI>Posts,</HI> and have a due regard to <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Disci∣pline</HI>; and Men that are <HI>able to teach</HI> others the <HI>Art of War,</HI> and the Use of <HI>Martial Wea∣pons.:</HI> Men of a publick and generous Spirit, of known <HI>Probity</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> and of exemplary <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Sobriety,</HI> who will endeavour to promote <HI>Order, Temperance</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> as well as <HI>Military</HI> Skill and Valour among their Soldiers. <HI>Psal.</HI> 101.6. Doubt∣less <HI>David</HI>'s Eyes were on such to dwell with him in the Camp, as well as Court; and this will have an happy Influence on the advance∣ment of <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> as well as the Art and Skill of <HI>War.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> But the Example in our Text also respects such as are honoured with <HI>Commissions</HI> under the CAPTAIN-GENERAL and Chief Commander.</P>
<P>The Command in the Text may be sup∣posed to be given particularly to them; and if it be incumbent on the <HI>chief Officers</HI> and the <HI>Legislature</HI> to give them <HI>Orders,</HI> Com∣mands
<PB N="24" REF="003589_0022_0FF833E52D098E68"/>
and Laws for the <HI>Militia,</HI> surely they should pay a due Honour and Regard to them.</P>
<P>I may therefore with <HI>due deference</HI> say, this Matter belongs also to the other <HI>Com∣manders</HI> of the <HI>Armies</HI> of this our <HI>Israel;</HI> to the <HI>Captains of Thousands,</HI> and the <HI>Captains of Hundreds</HI>; or in the Language of the present Day, to the <HI>Colonels,</HI> to the <HI>Majors,</HI> to the <HI>Captains,</HI> &amp;c. every one that bears a <HI>Commis∣sion</HI> in the Field, is to use his Endeavour to <HI>revive</HI> and <HI>encourage Military Exercises,</HI> and the Martial Spirit, Art and Courage among us.</P>
<P>And in order hereto, to labour to excel in <HI>warlike Skill,</HI> and make himself an <HI>accomplish∣ed Soldier,</HI> and Master of the <HI>Art of War,</HI> which he is to teach others; to take care to fill up and honour the Office he sustains, and maintain the Dignity and Authority of it.</P>
<P>If there be any <HI>Honour</HI> in your <HI>Commissions,</HI> as surely Sirs there is; then do not lose it, nor let it suffer, and be brought into Con∣tempt, by slighting &amp; despising it your selves, and suffering others, or giving them Occasi∣on to trample on it.</P>
<P>I may say further, such are to endeavour to instruct their Soldiers in the Art of War, and the Use of warlike Weapons, and make them expert therein: And in order hereto, to attend with dure Care, and in the proper Seasons, on Military Exercies on Days of Troopings, Trainings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and this for the
<PB N="25" REF="003589_0023_0FF833E0CECCE508"/>
true and noble End thereof; not for <HI>Sport</HI> and <HI>Mirth,</HI> nor to give magnificent <HI>Treats</HI> to your Soldiers, which is so destructive to Martial Skill and Valour, and so often fru∣strates the great Ends of Trainings; but for the advancement of Military Art and Skill, and to fit your Soldiers for <HI>Actual Service.</HI></P>
<P>I may say further, our Text may be con∣ceived to concern <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Masters,</HI> they are to send their Children and Servants to <HI>Trainings,</HI> and by all proper Means endea∣vour to train them up in Military Exercises and Skill.</P>
<P>And this <HI>Art</HI> and these <HI>Exercises</HI> are too <HI>noble, manly</HI> and <HI>honourable,</HI> to be below or unbecoming the Dignity of the greatest. The excellent Example of our Father <HI>Abraham,</HI> who trained up all his Servants in the Affairs of War, <HI>Gen.</HI> 14.14. should excite us hereun∣to.</P>
<P>And all Soldiers ought conscientiously to attend their Duty herein: If they are to be <HI>taught,</HI> then they must endeavour to learn <HI>War.</HI> They are not to slight, nor carelesly neglect to attend, much less designedly avoid the Exercises prescribed by Law, for their E∣ducation in this manly and necessary <HI>Art.</HI> They are not to come to the Field to mock and deride their Officers, nor meerly for Sport and Diversion; but with hearty desires and sincere endeavours to acquaint themselves with all the Exercises, and every part of the Art of War.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="003589_0024_0FF833E2BB970140"/>But 'tis time I proceed to the third and last Thing I proposed for clearing the Text, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>That 'tis desireable that a People should be taught that</HI> Manner <HI>of</HI> warring, <HI>and the</HI> Use of those Martial Weapons <HI>which may be of most Service against those Enemies that they are most likely to have War with.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Philistines</HI> were an Enemy that the King and People of <HI>Israel</HI> at <HI>that time</HI> most feared; they had long been a Scourge to them; and they had a well trained Army, skilful in the <HI>Art,</HI> and expert in the Use and handling of the Weapons of War; bold in ad∣venturing, and couragious in fighting.</P>
<P>Now a great part of their Strength lay in their Dexterity and Skill in the <HI>use of the Bow</HI>; they were <HI>expert Archers,</HI> as we learn from the Account of the <HI>Battle</HI> with <HI>Saul</HI> and his Armies, forecited 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 31. and as has been above noted.</P>
<P>And now being <HI>flushed</HI> with the late <HI>Victo∣ry,</HI> they were like to be undaunted in ano∣ther <HI>Onset,</HI> and therefore <HI>David</HI> would have his Soldiers now taught the <HI>use of the Bow</HI>; (but not so as to neglect the use of other Wea∣pons) that they might meet their Enemies with the same Weapon, and excel them there∣in, and vanquish them therewith.</P>
<P>And this shows how proper and commend∣able 'tis for God's People to teach their Sol∣diers, if not the very same Weapons that
<PB N="27" REF="003589_0025_0FF833E9204F4D20"/>
their Enemies use, yet at least such as are of most Service to fight against them with.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Sons</HI> are then not only to be taught the <HI>Art of War</HI> in general, but that manner of fighting and carrying on a War in particu∣lar, and the use of those Weapons which are most likely to succeed in prosecuting a War, (if ever there be Occasion, which God grant there never may) against the Enemies we have most Reason to fear that we may have War with. And the Case may be so with a People, that they may have Occasion and Need to have their Soldiers acquainted with all sorts of warring, all manner of fighting, and the use of all kinds of Military Weapons; they may have Occasion to acquaint them∣selves not only with the Weapons and Man∣ner of War with one, and that a neighbour∣ing Nation, but with different and distant People: and may it not be so within this Land?</P>
<P>And he will be a <HI>finished Soldier,</HI> that can find, fight and conquer his Enemies in the Thicket of the Woods; and immediately fall into a marshalled and regular Army, or into a disciplined Troop, and fight and overcome in open Field; and also excel again on the mighty Deep, and understand the best Man∣ner of fighting on the <HI>Sea.</HI> And <HI>Soldiers</HI> should not only learn to <HI>handle their Arms,</HI> and use their Weapons, but it becomes them to study their Enemies, to know the <HI>Weapons
<PB N="28" REF="003589_0026_0FF833EAAD5E0B50"/>
of War</HI> they <HI>use,</HI> and in which they are most <HI>expert</HI>; to know where their Strength lies, and so how they may with the greatest Ease defend themselves, and annoy and vanquish their Enemies.</P>
<P>In this lies a very considerable part of the <HI>Accomplishments</HI> of a <HI>Soldier.</HI></P>
<P>The same <HI>Weapons,</HI> the same Manner of <HI>fighting</HI> that the disciplined Armies of <HI>Europe</HI> use and practice to Advantage, would not be so serviceable against the Enemies that have most troubled <HI>New-England.</HI> And so on the contrary.</P>
<P>And since we are not sure but we may a∣gain be molested by them, or others like them; and since 'tis not impossible that we may be invaded by more regular Armies from beyond the Seas, and be called to fight with valiant and marshalled Armies, and discipli∣ned Troops in the open Field; I would here (as my Text leads me) <HI>humbly offer</HI> to Consi∣deration, whether it is not desireable, and would not be prudent in this People of the LORD, and that even now tho' in a Time of Peace,</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>That some of the young and valiant Sons of</HI> New-England, <HI>should be trained up in the way of fighting, and the use of those warlike In∣struments that would be of most Service in a
<PB N="29" REF="003589_0027_0FF833ED434547C0"/>
War against the</HI> Salvages of the Wilderness <HI>and their</HI> Confederates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis with singular Satisfaction to me, that His EXCELLENCY has in his great Wisdom and Pater∣nal Concern and Care for the lasting Peace and Pros∣perity of this Province, recommended the same Thing that I have here humbly offered, to the Ho∣nourable General Assembly, as I find in his Speech to the Honourable Court, on the 1st of <HI>June</HI> 1732. which I was not so happy as to see, till after the de∣livery of this Discourse, it being printed the same Day.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>Might it not be of unspeakable Service to this Land, if some of our brave, hardy and intrepid <HI>Youths,</HI> and others in our Frontier Towns and elsewhere, might be encouraged by some Means to acquaint themselves more perfectly with the Woods, and that even in the Land of those that have been our Ene∣mies, and find out the <HI>Hants</HI> and <HI>lurking Pla∣ces</HI> of those who have done us most hurt; that if ever they should be called forth, they may know where and how to find out our Enemies, and fight and conquer them even when they are at <HI>home.</HI> That they inure them∣selves to <HI>Travel,</HI> and learn to endure <HI>Hardness</HI>; learn to <HI>travel</HI> in the <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Swamps,</HI> in which there is a great <HI>Art</HI>; and to know the <HI>Hills, Mountains</HI> and <HI>Rivers</HI>; that they may not be any where at a loss; and also to make themselves <HI>perfect</HI> in the <HI>use</HI> of those Weapons which are most adapted to such Services.</P>
<P>We have seen something of the Advantages
<PB N="30" REF="003589_0028_0FF833EF72CA80A0"/>
of this; and it is much to be wished, that we might not be dejected, nor let such a Spirit die among us for want of Countenance and Encouragement: And that altho' some such mighty and valiant Soldiers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>viz.</HI> The expert and valiant Capt. <HI>Lovewell, Robbins, Frye, Harwood, Fullam,</HI> and several others.</NOTE> have fallen glo∣riously fighting for us in the Fields of the Woods.</P>
<P>And would it not also be of great Service to us, if <HI>Troops,</HI> which have been such a Ter∣ror to these Enemies, and such a Safe-guard to us in former Days, might be encouraged? and that a proper Proportion of our <HI>Soldiers</HI> might by suitably Exercises be made expert and skilful in every part of the Art of ma∣naging of and fighting with the <HI>Horse</HI>? of which we have that Character given <HI>Job</HI> 39.19. and on.</P>
<P>The Advantage hereof might be unspeaka∣ble. If it were known among those Nations, that we are every way prepared with expert and valiant <HI>Troopers</HI> and other Soldiers, this might happily prevent much Bloodshed, and perhaps prevent there ever being another War. But if there should be nothing of this Nature, we may well fear that they who have seldom or never been at Peace with us, but because they feared our Forces, or to serve themselves of us, will (when they see us careless) again get Heart and Courage, and molest us.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003589_0029_0FF833F102B9EBF8"/>And may we not think, that some of the Nations of the <HI>Indians</HI> have been (by God) left to prove us by, that we <HI>might know</HI> and <HI>to teach us War,</HI> as some of the Nations of <HI>Canaan</HI> were? <HI>Judges</HI> 3. <HI>begin.</HI> And ought we not to endeavour to answer God's just Ex∣pectations from us herein?</P>
<P>I would just say, Is it not to be wished, that our <HI>Frontiers</HI> might be settled in a more defensive Posture? and that our <HI>Forts</HI> and <HI>Garrisons</HI> might be always kept in due <HI>Repair?</HI> stored with good Arms and Ammunition, and manned with expert effective and valiant Commanders and Soldiers?</P>
<P>But after all, will it not be allowed in me, if I take this Opportunity unexpectedly put into my Hands by <HI>God,</HI> to say thus publick∣ly, Is there not yet a more <HI>excellent</HI> Way? I mean to overcome and win over to us the <HI>Indian Tribes,</HI> by observing strict Justice in our Commerce with them, and by not allow∣ing them large Quantities of spirituous Drink, which is so destructive to most of that Peo∣ple? and by using all possible Means and Methods to instruct them in and win them over to, the true and holy <HI>Protestant Religion</HI>?</P>
<P>From what I know of that People, I am fully perswaded that such <HI>Wisdom would be much better than Weapons of War</HI> with them, and more effectually subdue them under us.</P>
<P>And it may be well worthy Considerati∣on and Enquiry, Whether we <HI>as a People,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="003589_0030_0FF833F2F41DC430"/>
have done all that God expects of us in this respect? and whether God has not formerly suffered them to be <HI>Pricks in our Eyes, and Thorns in our Sides,</HI> to excite us to a greater Care and Concern for their precious and im∣mortal Souls?</P>
<P>It is a <HI>lamentable</HI> Truth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I say this, because I know it by unhappy Experience.</NOTE>, that the <HI>English</HI> do much to debauch them, and in a dreadful degree (by bad Counsel, and by giving and selling them <HI>inebriating Liquors,</HI> notwith∣standing the Laws of <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>good Laws of this Land</HI> against so sinful and destructive a Practice) prevent the Efficacy that it might be hoped the Gospel might otherwise have upon them, where they enjoy it. And should we not, as a People, do as much to save their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmortal <HI>Souls,</HI> as particular Persons do to ruin and destroy them?</P>
<P>And will it not be pleasing to God, and profitable even to us, if there be some <HI>effectual Way</HI> found, to have <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>well qualified Missionaries</HI> sent among them? and that there be such Encouragement given by those who have the Management of this Affair put into their Hands by <HI>God,</HI> as would be effectual in some good measure, to excite <HI>such</HI> among the <HI>Sons of the Prophets</HI> in our Land, who are Men <HI>well qualified</HI> with <HI>natural Strength of Body,</HI> and accomplished with the <HI>Endowments</HI> of good <HI>Literature</HI> and proper <HI>Dispositions</HI> and
<PB N="33" REF="003589_0031_0FF833F559DB79F0"/>
<HI>Graces,</HI> to undertake a <HI>Service</HI> which will try the <HI>Powers</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> of the greatest Men? Tho' this be a <HI>Digression,</HI> yet I hope my im∣mediate Concern for some of that Nation, will be esteemed a sufficient Excuse for me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here again I cannot forbear (with the greatest <HI>Gratitude</HI> to <HI>God)</HI> to express my very great Joy, to find in His EXCELLENCY's late Speech be∣fore-mentioned, a Paragraph, wherein the Encou∣ragement and Support of <HI>Missionaries</HI> among the <HI>Eastern Indians</HI> is recommended to the Honourable General Court. 'Tis with Admiration and Praise to <HI>God,</HI> that I read and hear what pious and gene∣rous Persons have done and are doing in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Advancement of pure Religion among the <HI>Indians</HI> here: And I cannot but ardent∣ly wish and pray, that this Province may join (a∣greable to the pious Proposal of his Excellency) and do all that is proper for the Advancement of that glorious Design, wherein the Honour of <HI>God</HI> and our own Felicity is so much concerned.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I proceed to say,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Is it not very desireable, and will it not be very honourable and profitable, that</HI> others <HI>be taught those Military Exercises, and the use of those Weapons that may be most suitable to encounter Regular Troops and disciplined Armies in the open Field</HI>?</P>
<P>Indeed 'tis proper that all <HI>Soldiers</HI> should be taught <HI>this</HI>; and particularly those that inhabit the <HI>Sea-Coasts,</HI> and are most exposed to the <HI>Invasion</HI> of any foreign <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>Power.</HI> Such should be exercised and skilled in the <HI>Manner of fighting,</HI> and the use of those <HI>Instru∣ments</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="003589_0032_0FF833F75135DA70"/>
and that <HI>Armour</HI> which are most used among the warlike Nations round about. This is also of very great Importance, and 'tis pity it should ever be discountenanced, discouraged or come to nothing.</P>
<P>And I cannot be pleased with the Reason∣ing of such as argue, that because this ho∣nourable <HI>Artillery Company</HI> are not taught the Manner of fighting used by the <HI>Salvages in the Wilderness,</HI> so much as the more noble and manly Exercises of the more polished and civilized Nations; and because they are not called forth to fight in the Woods; that there∣fore they and their Exercises are to be sligh∣ted and discountenanced; and that 'tis too great an Honour done to them <HI>annually,</HI> to keep up the Solemnities of this Day.</P>
<P>Surely our honoured <HI>Fathers</HI> in the <HI>Civil Government</HI> and the <HI>Ministry</HI> did not think so: And if these Things were intirely laid aside, 'tis much to be feared that in time our Case would be like that of <HI>Laish</HI> before-mention∣ed. I can't think but these Things have and may have an happy Influence on the Military Affairs of the Province, as long as they have the Smiles and Countenance of our honoura∣ble <HI>Legislature,</HI> and of the venerable <HI>Ministry</HI> of the <HI>Province.</HI></P>
<P>I may just add thirdly and lastly,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Is it not proper and desirable, that some among this People should be taught the Me∣thods and the use of Instruments proper for</HI> Sea-Fight?</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="003589_0033_0FF833F8DEAED7D8"/>Valiant and expert <HI>Admirals</HI> and <HI>Sea-Cap∣tains</HI> are as honourable and useful as Officers in the Field; and <HI>gallant</HI> Soldiers on the <HI>Seas</HI> are Men highly to be <HI>esteemed.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English Navy,</HI> and the <HI>unequalled Sol∣diers</HI> in the <HI>British Fleet,</HI> have been no small part of the <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> of the Realm for a long Time; and 'tis pity we should ever lose the <HI>Command</HI> of the Seas.</P>
<P>Would it not then be well, if our <HI>Sailors</HI> and those of our Brethren who are called to do Business on the mighty Waters, might be made expert Soldiers also?</P>
<P>Thus I have (as God has enabled me) considered this part of the holy Scriptures; and I think I have advanced nothing but what (without Force) flowed from it, in the Sense I have understood it, and what is a∣greable to the <HI>Analogy of Faith,</HI> and in some measure applicable to the <HI>Occasion</HI> of <HI>this Day.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Application</HI> shall be in few Words.</P>
<P>And in general, Let what has been offered, serve to excite all the <HI>Lord's People</HI> to en∣deavour to <HI>revive</HI> a <HI>Martial Spirit</HI> among the Children of <HI>New-England</HI>; and do what they can to encourage the teaching and acquiring the Military Art, Skill and Valour.</P>
<P>This was the chief Design of our Text, and of this <HI>Elegy,</HI> (as all agree) even to stir up a warlike Spirit, Emulation and Valour, and quicken to teach and learn the Art of War among the Sons of <HI>Judah,</HI> as was before ob∣served.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="003589_0034_0FF833FAF23034A0"/>And my Design has been in this Discourse, to advance the <HI>Glory of God</HI> in promoting the same good End; and I shall think I have been Instrumental in doing good Service for God and this his People, if this imperfect Discourse may be blessed and made Service∣able to promote these Things.</P>
<P>And will every one be intreated and pre∣vailed with to do what is proper in his Place, to promote Skill and Valour among our Sol∣diers?</P>
<P>And the noble <HI>Example</HI> of this <HI>valorous and renowned General and King,</HI> is with Submission, humbly proposed to Your EXCELLENCY.</P>
<P>And we trust that the honourable General Court will be <HI>intreated</HI> to join herein, if not by making <HI>new Laws,</HI> even such as might more effectually compel those that are not to be drawn by a sense of Honour and Duty to it, to endeavour to acquire <HI>Military Skill,</HI> by increasing the Fines on Delinquents.</P>
<P>Or if this be not thought proper, yet that there be some effectual Care taken, that the good <HI>Laws</HI> already provided may be duly executed; and not shamefully slighted, neg∣lected or evaded by Officers or common Sol∣diers.</P>
<P>Again, will such of whom it is expected that they make a <HI>Presentation</HI> of the <HI>Names</HI> of those who may be set at the <HI>Head</HI> of par∣ticular Companies, (as Captains, <HI>&amp;c.)</HI> be exhorted to take due Care therein, that they
<PB N="37" REF="003589_0035_0FF833FD4F69FBE0"/>
present such as are every way qualified and accomplished.</P>
<P>We would hope, that none will do any thing of that Importance for Favour or Par∣tiality, much less for the sake of <HI>Gain</HI>: if they do, they must in a very great measure answer for the Defects of such Officers, and bear the Reproach of it.</P>
<P>For it is morally impossible for one <HI>Man</HI> personally to know the Character of every Man in such a Province as this is.</P>
<P>Further, Let all who have or may have the Honour to bear Commissions under the <HI>King</HI> in the <HI>Militia,</HI> be exhorted to honour your Posts, whether higher or lower, and faithfully perform the <HI>Duties</HI> of them: Endea∣vour to be <HI>expert, accomplished</HI> and most <HI>vali∣ant Soldiers your selves.</HI></P>
<P>And here I would propose, Would it not be of Advantage in order hereto, if more of the Officers of the <HI>Militia</HI> would be pleased to list into the ARTILLERY-COMPANY?</P>
<P>This <HI>Honourable Company</HI> was undoubtedly designed in its Original, to be a sort of <HI>COL∣LEGE,</HI> to <HI>train up</HI> and <HI>Educate</HI> the <HI>Sons</HI> of <HI>this People</HI> in <HI>Military Skill,</HI> and make them <HI>expert</HI> and valiant Soldiers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Charter</HI> of this honourable Company, dated <HI>April</HI> 24. 1638. Thus careful were our Fathers to promote every thing that might be for the future Peace and Happiness of their Posterity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And many of the Commission-Officers, the</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="003589_0036_0FF833FF4531DD50"/>Colonels, Majors, Captains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the ad∣jacent and some of distant Regiments and Companies formerly (as I am told) did be∣long to it; so that it was a <HI>Seminary</HI> of <HI>ex∣pert Commanders,</HI> and was of extensive Ser∣viceableness; and 'tis pity it should not be so still. Will then the Officers be intreated to join themselves to it, and by this and o∣ther Means accomplish themselves more and more for the Offices they sustain, and the Services expected from them.</P>
<P>And then carefully and seasonably attend Military Exercises, Days of Training, and the proper Business thereof; observe the Laws of the <HI>Militia,</HI> and endeavour to teach those under you the Art of War: Maintain the Ho∣nour and Authority of your Posts, and suffer not your Selves and Offices to fall into Con∣tempt. Be known in your Offices, at least in the <HI>Field.</HI></P>
<P>And beware of every thing that may in the least blemish your Character as <HI>Men of Ho∣nour</HI> and as <HI>Christians.</HI> Once more, be per∣swaded to do what in you lies, by your Ex∣amples, Instructions and Authority, to keep your Soldiers from Intemperance and Disor∣ders on the Days set apart for Military Ex∣ercises, and on the Evenings following.</P>
<P>And let the <HI>Ministers of Christ</HI> do what is proper for them in their Place to encourage these Things.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="003589_0037_0FF83400D04BFB58"/>And let Parents and Masters also join here∣in; and let us not bring up our Children so tenderly and delicately, that they shall be unable to endure Hardness on any Occasion.</P>
<P>Finally, let all <HI>Soldiers</HI> be excited hence, duly, seriously and conscientiously to attend <HI>Trainings,</HI> and all the <HI>Exercises</HI> in order to become good <HI>Soldiers</HI>: Don't slight nor shun them, nor attend them only for Diversion, but make a Business of them in their Season; and endeavour to make your selves Masters of the <HI>Art of War.</HI> And O keep your selves from <HI>Effeminacy</HI> and <HI>Intemperance,</HI> which has been the ruin of so many Soldiers.</P>
<P>All that now remains, is a more particular <HI>Application</HI> of these Things to the very <HI>anci∣ent and honourable Company</HI> who have called <HI>me</HI> to speak to them in <HI>the Name of the LORD</HI> this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Honoured and much Esteemed,</HI></P>
<P>What has been now said, has a singular Reference, and may (I think) with great Propriety be applied to <HI>You.</HI></P>
<P>Your <HI>Profession</HI> as <HI>Soldiers</HI> is truly <HI>Honour∣able,</HI> and much to be <HI>esteemed</HI>; and also to be encouraged by all <HI>God's People</HI> in their several Stations and Relations: and your Exercises and Endeavours to make your selves accomplished Soldiers are laudable, and to be smiled upon, countenanced and encou∣raged.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="003589_0038_0FF83402C5A6B378"/>And as this <HI>Company</HI> was many Years since erected, and very much honoured by the Magistrates of that Day, and favoured and countenanced by the Ministry; so it may be still, if it be not in some measure owing to your selves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Honourable General Court</HI> put great <HI>Honour</HI> upon this Company in the begin∣ning <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Privileges granted to it, and some Lands given to defray the Charges.</NOTE>, and since; and they have lately put singular Marks of <HI>Respect</HI> on you; nor are the <HI>Ambassadors of Christ</HI> wanting in showing you all that Regard that is proper for Men of our <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>GOD himself has also honoured your Pro∣fession, not only in the great Regards shown to expert and valiant Soldiers in the <HI>Sacred Oracles,</HI> but by taking to himself the Name of a <HI>Man of War,</HI> the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> the <HI>God of Armies,</HI> the <HI>Lord mighty in Battle,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>And hence it may be said to you, undoubt∣edly <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> expect something <HI>singular</HI> and <HI>extraordinary</HI> in and from <HI>you:</HI> You are to be <HI>skilful, expert</HI> and <HI>valiant Soldiers:</HI> 'tis expected that <HI>you</HI> be <HI>expert</HI> in the <HI>use of the Bow,</HI> or all Martial Weapons; that you la∣bour to revive these <HI>Exercises,</HI> and the <HI>Art of War</HI>; and if a warlike Spirit decays every where else, we would hope to find it in the <HI>Artillery.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="003589_0039_0FF834052CD0A418"/>We lament every thing in this <HI>Company,</HI> that looks like a drawing back from that Martial Spirit Skill and Valour that was once your Glory.</P>
<P>And 'tis much to be wished, that more of the <HI>Commission-Officers</HI> of the Regiments and Companies in the Country did belong to your Company, that they might be well (and they can't be too well) qualified and accom∣plished for the Posts they sustain, and the Service they are called to.</P>
<P>And is not a <HI>Military Spirit,</HI> and a Love and Regard to the <HI>warlike Exercises</HI> and <HI>Art</HI> very much <HI>decay'd</HI> even in <HI>this Company?</HI> Are not your Days of <HI>Training</HI> very much disre∣garded, and thinly attended? have you not very many <HI>Delinquents</HI>?</P>
<P>And have all that do attend, a due regard to promote <HI>Expertness</HI> in the Military Art in themselves and others?</P>
<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> Consider, you are <HI>Voluntiers</HI> herein, and you have Power by your <HI>Charter</HI> in some measure to regulate these Things.</P>
<P>You will then (I trust) suffer me to say, Will it not be for the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> and of your <HI>Company,</HI> and help to revive and pro∣mote Military Skill, which is the professed Design of this <HI>Honourable Company,</HI> for you to take care that you admit not any to the <HI>Honours</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> of your <HI>Company,</HI> but such as appear truly desirous to learn <HI>War,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="003589_0040_0FF8340756155DB8"/>
and are <HI>effective Men,</HI> Men of known <HI>Loyalty, Vertue</HI> and <HI>Temperance</HI>?</P>
<P>And when you choose your <HI>Officers,</HI> that you elect those that are Men of a Marshal and valiant Spirit, such as you will willingly fight under if called to it; <HI>Men</HI> that are able to teach you the <HI>Art of War,</HI> and will do it; and such as you may think can and will march before you, and lead you into the Field of Battle, and fight at the <HI>Head</HI> of your Company, and teach you Courage, and in∣spire you with Valour by their own Exam∣ple?</P>
<P>And such as may be chosen, are to labour to be well qualified for what is justly ex∣pected from them in such Posts and Stations.</P>
<P>Further, as Endeavours to gain Dexterity and Expertness in the <HI>Art of War</HI> are truly laudable, so you are all to be exhorted, with Diligence to attend every Opportunity put into your Hands for the Advancement there∣of.</P>
<P>'Tis really dishonourable for any of this <HI>Company</HI> to be <HI>Delinquents,</HI> when it may be helped.</P>
<P>You may make Laws in a great measure for governing your selves; and 'tis in your Power to augment the <HI>Fines</HI>: and might it not be well to do it, if you shall find that a sense of <HI>Honour</HI> and a love to these <HI>Exercises,</HI> and a desire of the <HI>Glory</HI> of being <HI>expert</HI> and
<PB N="43" REF="003589_0041_0FF82C23857C4818"/>
<HI>brave Soldiers,</HI> prove Motives too weak to fill up your <HI>Ranks and Files</HI>?</P>
<P>You are also in the <HI>Name of GOD</HI> to be exhorted, to pursue these Things for <HI>right Ends</HI>; even for the <HI>Glory of GOD,</HI> and that you may be better qualified and accomplish∣ed (if called thereto) to fight the <HI>Battles</HI> of the <HI>LORD,</HI> and <HI>play the Men</HI> for the <HI>Lives, Liberties, Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Cities</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> You ought to have this in your View, to qualify your selves for <HI>actual Service.</HI></P>
<P>And you ought to consider, whether you can answer it, if you have no higher <HI>Views</HI> than to <HI>beat</HI> the <HI>Air</HI> with your <HI>Weapons,</HI> and to make your <HI>Days of Exercise, Days of Sport and Diversion</HI>; since the Divine Aids are so solemnly implored for you, and the Divine Blessing upon you, (at your desire at least) once a Year; and you come into the <HI>House of God,</HI> that you and these Exercises may be sanctified by the <HI>Word</HI> and Prayer.</P>
<P>Lastly, and above all,</P>
<P>List under the <HI>Banner</HI> of the glorious <HI>Captain</HI> of your <HI>Salvation: study</HI> your <HI>Spiri∣tual Warfare</HI>: prove your <HI>Spiritual Armour: put on the whole Armour of God</HI>; and be ex∣pert in the Use of every <HI>Weapon</HI> therein; and your <HI>Weapons</HI> in <HI>this are not Carnal but Spiritual, and mighty thro' God, for the pulling down of strong holds.</HI> Again, <HI>study</HI> your <HI>Ene∣mies,</HI> and <HI>be not ignorant of their Devices.</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="003589_0042_0FF834094AADBBF0"/>
Learn how to <HI>meet</HI> and how to <HI>vanquish</HI> them. And be of <HI>good Courage</HI> herein; <HI>play the Man</HI> for your <HI>precious Souls</HI>; never <HI>give Ground,</HI> nor <HI>cowardly quit the Field:</HI> be al∣ways on your <HI>Guard,</HI> and <HI>compleatly armed: Face to your glorious</HI> Leader, looking to JE∣SUS, who always rides forth in his Royalty at the <HI>Head of his Armies,</HI> with his Banners displayed, and he will give them the <HI>Victo∣ry.</HI></P>
<P>Your Calling should mind you of this Warfare, and it may greatly serve you in it: And to be an <HI>expert</HI> and <HI>valiant Soldier</HI> in o∣ther <HI>Wars,</HI> and unskil'd and <HI>cowardly</HI> in this, is <HI>inexcusable.</HI></P>
<P>And here tho' you fight against <HI>Principa∣lities</HI> and <HI>Powers,</HI> and tho' all the Forces and gloomy Regiments of the <HI>Prince of the power of the Air</HI> are set in <HI>Battle array</HI> against you, yet be not dismayed, but trust in your Cap∣tain; who has <HI>spoiled Principalities and Pow∣ers, and made a shew of them openly.</HI> And if you study and become Masters of the <HI>Art of this War,</HI> and do not shamefully fly your Colours, nor desert the Service of your Cap∣tain, but prove your selves expert, valiant and loyal Soldiers; and if you hold out to the End, you shall be <HI>more than Conquerors</HI> thro' <HI>Christ who has loved</HI> you.</P>
<P>And this part of the Exhortation belongs to all.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="003589_0043_0FF8340AD69D4A98"/>Every one, <HI>Male</HI> and <HI>Female,</HI> must <HI>list Voluntiers</HI> in <HI>this War</HI>; and we must herein <HI>fight; fight manfully,</HI> or <HI>die eternally.</HI> Let eve∣ry one then so manage this <HI>Spiritual Warfare</HI> now, wherein you must <HI>fight, not as one that beats the Air,</HI> but very <HI>couragiously,</HI> and be always in <HI>actual Service,</HI> and take the <HI>King∣dom of Heaven</HI> by a holy <HI>Violence</HI>; that you may, when encountring <HI>Death,</HI> the <HI>King of Terrors,</HI> the <HI>last Enemy,</HI> be able to say joy∣fully and <HI>triumphantly,</HI> with him 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.7, 8. <HI>I have fought a good Fight, I have finish∣ed my Course, I have kept the Faith; hence∣forth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righ∣teousness, which the LORD the righteous Judge shall give me at that Day.</HI></P>
