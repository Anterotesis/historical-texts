<P><HI>WHereas Dr. W. D. has lately published a</HI> little vain Book, full of Cant and impro∣priety; <HI>which yet</HI> in Vanity he may judge, would be acceptable <HI>to A. S. M. D. &amp; F. R. S.

<HEAD>TO my very Worthy Physician, Mr. <HI>ZABDIEL BOYLSTON.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Know no Person so proper, to present the following Dialogue to as your Self. Such has been your undaunted Resolu∣tion, and truly Heroic Courage, thro' the whole Course of your dangerous En∣terprize; and such your Conduct and Wisdom, as merit our highest Regards, and most public Thanks. To <HI>You</HI> under the Auspicious Providence of GOD, we are In∣debted for the Blessing of INOCULATION; for you can claim the undivided Honour of Introducing it among us. And hadst not thou began it, perhaps, there would not have been found a Soul so truly great, as to have undertaken it. For this, Sir, I am bold to say, your Name shall be mention'd
<PB N="ii" REF="002339_0004_0FDB2BE7BA699918"/>
with Honour, whilst those Physicians, and others, who have signaliz'd themselves by their Malice and Opposition to you, shall be otherwise spoken of.</P>
<P>There is indeed little in this Debate, worthy of your Consideration: and I must confess it a folly, <HI>to answer these Fools ac∣cording to their folly</HI>; but, because they are <HI>wise in their own conceit,</HI> and that those that are blind with prejudice for their Writings, may (if possible) see the Vanity of them, and the injustice they have done your Self, as well as many Eminent and Superiour Persons among us.</P>

<P>Indeed, Sir, you can; for you have had a liberal Education at <HI>Billingsgate</HI>; the only place in the World to learn <HI>Broad English</HI> at.

<SP>

<P>I would <HI>debate</HI> with you, about the Libel you have lately printed in the form of a Letter, I suppose, to Dr. ALEXANDER SANDILANDE; I pray, what did you intend by that Letter?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I am a Man of Letters, and can write to my Friends and Betters, as well as any Man; and of them, and against them too, when I please; and would you have me wrap up my Talent in a Napkin? No,</HI> AC. <HI>to confess a Secret, I purpose to make the People know, I am a Learned Man, and a Master of a good Stile and Sense, as well as Medicine: And you know, the Practi∣tioners of the Town, are Illiterate Numskulls, and de∣pend upon their own Chimney Corner Improvements; while, I traffic to the Metropolis of Literature, and re∣ceive ample Communications from the very learned</HI> A. S. F. R. S. &amp; M. D.— <HI>Surely they'le think I'm somebody; And I shall run away with all the profit too. And if any Man is so brazenly impudent, as to whisper a good word for any Physician but my self, le shan't escape</HI> Scot∣free: <HI>I'le be foul on him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Foul</HI> on 'em, Thou can't be otherwise. And I'le say that for you, and a <HI>Fig</HI> for you; thou art <HI>foul</HI> on 'em with a Witness. And I know also, thou art proud and vain enough. But if <HI>it be possible for you once in your Life, to speak a word of Truth,</HI> prithee, tell me, what you further designed by your Letter. It can't be to oppose the <HI>Inoculation</HI> of the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; for you expresly de∣clare, <HI>Till after a few Years you shall pass no judgment on this Practice.</HI> And indeed this is the only Sentence that has so much as the least shadow of sense in it, for <HI>Sawny,</HI> you suspect, that within a <HI>few Months,</HI> you shall find the Aldest PHYSICIANS in <HI>England</HI> and all <HI>Europe,</HI> to approve the Practice, (which to your Confusion, <HI>we can assure you of already,</HI>) and that Persons of Quality, and <HI>great Numbers in the City and Suburbs,</HI> are saved by it; and then you hop'd to have an <HI>Hele</HI> to creep out of. But, <HI>Sawny,</HI> why must the World wait a <HI>few Years</HI> for that profound <HI>Judgment</HI> of yours, by which you think all Mankind must be determined. <HI>No; Sawny,</HI> there is not an AS in <HI>Europe,</HI> that thinks your <HI>Judgment</HI> worth hearing, much more, worth waiting a moment for. I tell you there∣fore, there was <HI>another Maggot</HI> in your addle pate, that gave you the <HI>Itch of Scribbling</HI>; and tho' we can all <HI>see</HI> what it was, yet I must have you <HI>Confess</HI> it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well then, Mr.</HI> DEMICUS, <HI>my design was, to
<PB N="3" REF="002339_0007_0FDB2BEC15F06CB0"/>
ridicule the Principal</HI> MINISTERS <HI>of Religion in the Town, and render their Ministry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us to the People: It is a thing I am strongly resolved upon; and I thought I had now got a pretty kind of an Handle for it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why so, <HI>Sawny</HI>? Have these Good Men done you any Wrong? or has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot thy Brother <HI>Mundungus</HI> sufficiently done it already?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes; but they have been such Villains as to speak respectfully of Dr.</HI> BOYLSTON; <HI>a Man I can never endure; they have bestowed upon him,</HI> Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ish Characters high enough to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the most Celebrated Physician in England Blush. <HI>I vow to be revenged on them.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Revenge</HI> may be <HI>sweet, Sawny,</HI> but it is not <HI>good</HI>; And had that <HI>Gentleman,</HI> whom you so disdain as a <HI>Cutter for the Store,</HI> been also a <HI>Cutter for the Simples</HI>; thou, <HI>Sawny,</HI> shouldst have been his <HI>first,</HI> tho' I fear, an <HI>incura∣ble</HI> Patient. A Gentleman of so much Skill and Success, as Dr. BOYLSTON is, ought to be Vindicated from your Abuses and Insults of him, in the <HI>News-Letter</HI>: especially, when he deserved so much of the SIX MINISTERS, and was so well known and so dear to them. But then, <HI>Sawny,</HI> you desir'd an Answer to a <HI>Case of Conscience</HI>; without which, perhaps, they would never have troubled you. And on this Occasion, they thought it highly became them, to rebuke your rude treatment of him, in alledging that to his <HI>Dishonour,</HI> which is so much his Glory and <HI>Recommen∣dation</HI>; that nothing in <HI>You,</HI> can stand in Competition with it. But still, <HI>Sawny,</HI> thou hast not yet confessed all: Come, open thy <HI>pedling Budget</HI>; let me see the Bottom of it. This will never be accounted a sufficient reason, why you should treat our MINISTERS with so much Fury, disdain and petulancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why then, I tell you plainly, I hate and abhor that Sett of Men</HI> —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, <HI>Sawny,</HI> I see I must add the rest; There is a Number in this Town, who are irreversibly resolved, to destroy the <HI>Religion</HI> of the Country; and the most effectual way to accomplish their resolve, is, to disaffect the People to their MINISTERS: and the Favourable Opinion they entertain of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> they think may be improved, as a proper <HI>Engine,</HI> to intrap the Inconside∣rate
<PB N="4" REF="002339_0008_0FDB2BEDD808F828"/>
People. And now nothing could put a better <HI>Gloss</HI> upon it, then to employ some of the PHYSICIANS as <HI>Tools</HI> to their accursed purpose. And accordingly you, <HI>Sawny,</HI> and your Brother, <HI>Mundungus,</HI> being Two Emi∣nent PHYSICIANS, and having more <HI>Impudence,</HI> and as ye think, more <HI>Learning,</HI> than the rest, appear in the Front, to ridicule the PARSONS for their <HI>Praying, Preaching, and Scribbling,</HI> (as you term it:) and to invite the People, (that will be so silly as to dance after your <HI>Scotch Bagpipes</HI>) to contemn them; And so proud you seem of your Office, that you cannot write six Lines, before you <HI>laugh,</HI> or <HI>grin</HI> at them. So the <HI>Fox</HI> rides the <HI>Goose,</HI> the <HI>Goose</HI> the <HI>Ass.</HI> —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Pray, who do you take to be the Goose</HI> Mr. Demicus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>A certain <HI>Soland Goose</HI>; thy own dear Self, <HI>Sawny</HI>; And tho' there be <HI>Fifteen</HI> of you on the Board, and but one Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocular <HI>Fox,</HI> yet he can make you <HI>move</HI> as he pleases. But it will be presently evident, that <HI>Goose</HI> is too Good a Name for you; I shall first show, what a <HI>Knave</HI> thou art; and then (which is an usual Favour of Heaven) what a <HI>Fool</HI> thou art, in the prosecution of thy Knavery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Knavery!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes <HI>Knavery</HI>! If <HI>Lying, Impudence</HI> and <HI>Malice,</HI> &amp;c. will make a <HI>Knave; Sawny,</HI> of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as full, as a what d'y'e call it, is of Poison. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why, what Lyes have I told?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Innumerable! I'le single out a few <HI>gross</HI> ones in <HI>matters of Fact</HI>; and which <HI>Sawny,</HI> you very well knew, (or might do so) when you wrote them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What's one, I pray?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say, Dr. MATHER <HI>sent Circular Letters to ALL the Practitioners of the Town, (the Owner of the Transactions excepted) inviting them to come into the Practice of Inoculating the Small-Pox.</HI> Here's not only <HI>one,</HI> but two or three compleat <HI>Lyes</HI>; a finisht Sen∣tence, which none but you could have spoke!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why, you won't say so?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Sawny,</HI> I say so, and will prove it too. As to the first part, h.e. that Dr. MATHER <HI>sent Circular Letters to ALL the Practitioners of the Town (the Owner
<PB N="5" REF="002339_0009_0FDB2BEF17AA0B60"/>
of the Transactions▪ excepted.</HI>) Dr. MATHER did indeed send, A <HI>Letter to the Physicians in the City of Boston,</HI> and directed it to One of them, a Worthy Schoolmaster, (whom we did not reproach for going out of his Line for prac∣tising Physick.) This he desired to be communicated to them; and, <HI>Sawny,</HI> your honourable <HI>Name</HI> was particularly in∣serted, and principally in the Direction. But he never sent a particular or seperate Epistle to <HI>Ev'ry One,</HI> as you must mean, or otherwise exclude your self from the Number of <HI>Practitioners.</HI> Indeed, he wrote a <HI>separate Note</HI> to one or two, but no more; with another Copy of his Letter to you, for fear they should be overlook'd among them. Besides, <HI>Sawny,</HI> this <HI>General Letter</HI> it self was not directed to ALL, there was <HI>some</HI> he had no thoughts of, as he told the Person by whom he desir'd it might be Communicated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why,</HI> Mr. Demicus, <HI>you make of it, what we of the Learned call, a Complicated Lye: — You seem to dis∣cover two Lyes in One.</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now for the other Sentence, (<HI>The Owner of the Transactions excepted</HI>;) Truth! it is somewhat hard, that the Dr. should affront your honour so much, as to di∣rect the Letter to any but your self, when you know there is not a Physician in the Town, that ought to be named the same Day with you. But however, Master <HI>Sawny,</HI> he inserted <HI>your Name in particular</HI>; and desired <HI>expressly,</HI> that they would not forget YOU. And notwithstanding you are so given over to <HI>Lying,</HI> and so <HI>brazen</HI> in it, as to say over again, that the DOCTORS <HI>Probity</HI> in his Abrig∣ment could not be concluded from his Addressing it to those who had the <HI>Original</HI> in their Hands; For say you the Truth is, he sent his <HI>Abstract</HI> to <HI>all</HI> the Noted Physicians in the Town, but not to the <HI>Owner</HI> of the <HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI> and then cry out <HI>Proh Fides</HI>! Ah <HI>Sawny, Proh Fides,</HI> sure enough! But now for t'other Passage; You say Dr. MATHER, <HI>invited them to come into the Practice of Inoculating the Small-Pox.</HI> And before this in the News-Letter, <HI>He applied to the Practitioners of the Place, to put this far fetcht, and not well voucht Method into Practice.</HI> But to see how far all this is true, I'le re∣cite the Conclusion of his <HI>Address</HI> to the Physicians, wherein the World may see his unspotted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ocence, and uncommon Charity.
<Q>I will only say (<HI>writes the</HI> DOCTOR)
<PB N="6" REF="002339_0010_0FDB2BF2CD625C70"/>
that inasmuch at the practice of suffering the Small-Pox in the way of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> has never yet, as far as I have heard, been introduced into our Nation where there are so many that would give great Sums to have their Lives ensured for an Escape from the Dangers of this dreadful Distemper; nor has ever any one in <HI>America,</HI> ever yet made the tryal of it, (tho' we have several <HI>Africans</HI> a∣mong us, as I now find, who tryed it in their own Country,) <HI>I cannot but</HI> move, that it be WARILY pro∣ceeded in. I durst not yet engage that, the <HI>Success</HI> of the Tryal here will be the same that has hitherto been in the other Hemisphere: But I am very confident, no Person would miscarry in it, but what would most cer∣tainly have miscarried upon taking the Contagion the <HI>Common Way</HI>: And I would <HI>humbly Advise,</HI> that it be never made but under the management of a Skilful PHY∣SICIAN, who will wisely <HI>prepare the Body</HI> for it, before he performs the Operation, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> My request is, That you would meet for a <HI>Consultation</HI> upon this Occa∣sion, and so deliberate upon it, that whoever first begins the practice, (<HI>if you Approve it should be beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n at all</HI>) may have the countenance of his worthy Brethren to for∣tify him in it.</Q>
<HI>June</HI> 6. 1721.</P>
<P>Now could any thing possibly be more candid and modest, than this <HI>Address</HI>? with what Conscience then do you intimate that he <HI>urged</HI> you; when he desires it should be <HI>warily</HI> proceeded in, and leaves it intirely to <HI>your Consul∣tation,</HI> whether it should be <HI>begun at all.</HI> And what is their in it could disturb you▪ May not a DIVINE who has (it may be) read more in <HI>Physic</HI> than any of you, sug∣gest modestly to your Lordships, his Thoughts on a matter of <HI>Public Concern,</HI> without being so superciliously treated, is this worthy Gentleman has been?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, 'Twas</HI> a Scandalum magnatum; <HI>Such</HI> Ignoramus's <HI>as he must not presume to Advise those of our Faculty; let such Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>khead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as he, and the</HI> Persons <HI>keep to their Text.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis well <HI>Sawny,</HI> only to humble thee by the way, 'twould have been much for thy Credit, if thou hadst been advising with several Good <HI>Old Women,</HI> we have among us, how to manage the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> in the <HI>Common Way,</HI> whilst thou Opposed <HI>Inoculation</HI>; many a Life might have
<PB N="7" REF="002339_0011_0FDB2BF5F9217918"/>
been saved if thou hadst. But what was the <HI>Principle,</HI> do you think that acted the DOCTOR in his humbly Pe∣titioning of you to meet, and <HI>Consult</HI> about it? He could have no personal Gain in View.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why I sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be is a Learned Gentleman, and what he did was out of a Pious &amp; Charitable design to do Good; But now I saw he is a Man of Whim, and Credulity; and he thinks this juncture a fit Opportunity, to make Experiment, upon his Neighbours, which he in Vanity judgeth will be Acceptable to the Royal Society.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why: he imposeth Nothing upon his Neighbours: he has only given them an <HI>Abstract</HI> of the Accounts of this Method of Transplanting the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> which are in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI>; and leaves them to their Liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But his</HI> Abstract <HI>is unfaithful, and the Account being in Latin, which his Neighbours don't understand, they must</HI> pin their Faith upon his Sle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I know you <HI>Sawny,</HI> and your Brethren, are ready enough, to say it is <HI>unfaithful</HI>; and to swear <HI>point Blank</HI> against it too, or any thing else that makes for <HI>Inoculation.</HI> But I shall believe it is a most <HI>Faithful Ab∣stract,</HI> till you shew me some <HI>instances</HI> to the Contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, I'le give a notorious one. Dr.</HI> TIMONIUS <HI>reports; At first the more prudent were Cautious; But Dr.</HI> MATHER <HI>says, At first the People were Cautious. What a vile Falsity is this?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou are mad, <HI>Sawny.</HI> You have forgot which side of the Hedge you are of; for if the <HI>People</HI> were Cautious, most Indubitably the <HI>Prudent,</HI> which are comprehended under the General Term (<HI>People</HI>) were <HI>Cautious.</HI> Hast thou no more to say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes; the words of</HI> PYLARINUS <HI>are,</HI> TURCAE HANC NEGLEXERUNT HUCUS QUE, <HI>which he trans∣lates, The Turks do not much come into it; whereas it should be, the Turks had not at all come into it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then by the way, what shameless wretches are you, <HI>Sawny,</HI> and your Friends, to insult us in print too, that it was first practised by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and that we fetcht it from the <HI>Mussulmen</HI>? Besides, <HI>Sawny,</HI> In the Copy of the Let∣ter, which the DOCTOR sent your Unworthiship, his words are, <HI>The Turks do not yet come into it</HI>: and how the word <HI>much</HI> came to be printed, I believe he cannot tell.</P>

<P>O Abominable! But, <HI>Sawny,</HI> he was giving a <HI>Short Abstract,</HI> and did not pretend a precise <HI>Translation.</HI> Yet, even here it is truer than yours. Tho' 'tis very probable that a Gentleman, who has published so many things in the <HI>Latin Tongue,</HI> wants a little of your Instruction: Especially since <HI>Mundungus</HI> too (a Fellow who 'tis well known, could not spell a Common English word; (no not <HI>Tobacco</HI> if it were to save his Life, tho' for the word <HI>Pilfer</HI> I will not say,) has found out that, Dr. MATHER <HI>wants Grammar Learning.</HI> However, I hope, when you have taught him <HI>Latin,</HI> and your Brother has taught him <HI>Grammar</HI> and <HI>Syllogisms</HI>; (as he pretends to do) he may be something of <HI>a Scholar</HI> at last.

<P><HI>Sawny,</HI> the <HI>Whetstone</HI> is now thine against the World; if he hath said nothing, thou hast, I am sure, said <HI>some∣thing</HI> to <HI>your</HI> purpose; viz. <HI>Two Children three Years Old died sometime after Eruption FROM INOCULATION.</HI> And from thence insinuate that Dr. MATHERS <HI>Abstract</HI> is defec∣tive.

But <HI>Sawny,</HI> if it should be found that Dr. TIMONIUS never said any such thing, but expresly declares the <HI>reverse,</HI> what would the World think of you? <HI>This</HI> is the real Truth. That Great Man did indeed say, they reported such a thing, but they can <HI>lye</HI> at <HI>Constantinople</HI> too, tho' perhaps not so well, nor fast as you can here; and the DOCTOR took the pains (he says) to go to the Houses, and inform himself, and he found the report absolutely false.</P>

Mr. COOPER tells you of some that have died by taking a <HI>Vomit,</HI> and drawing a <HI>Tooth</HI>; now had these any reason to dye with the horror of <HI>Self-Murtherers</HI> in their minds; or must only they dye so, that have not the Happiness to dye under your unskilful Hands.

But was ever such a <HI>Spreading the Infection,</HI> prosecuted as a <HI>Felony</HI>? And is not <HI>Inoculation</HI> less dangerous and poi∣soning than this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay, but here's the giving of a poison Mr. Demicus!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, <HI>Sawny,</HI> all <HI>Medicines</HI> that have <HI>Poison</HI> in them, if you give them, you incur the Guilt of <HI>Felony.</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="002339_0021_0FDB2C0C52D93DB8"/>
What! doth a PHYSICIAN talk so? Ah! <HI>Sawny,</HI> if your Doctrine were to be proceeded upon, how soon should we see <HI>thee within thy LINE</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But I say, Inoculation is a Felonious poisoning!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what a <HI>Murderer</HI> are you, who have <HI>private∣ly</HI> declared so often in Favour of it; and <HI>publickly</HI> said you should <HI>pass no positive judgment</HI> on the practice; tho' me∣thinks, thou art pretty positive it is a <HI>Felony,</HI> and that the Physicians ought to be hanged for it!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not have any Body hanged, but Dr.</HI> BOYL∣STON, <HI>and the</HI> INOCULATING PARSONS, <HI>that have spoke respectfully of him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, <HI>Sawny,</HI> thy <HI>malice</HI> goes a little further than so; for thou hast an Abominable Flout upon the JUDICI∣OUS MAGISTRATES, who you say are in <HI>the Humour of Inoculation,</HI> i e. in a <HI>Felonious</HI> humour, of abetting and countenancing a thing, they ought to be hanged for. Unparallel'd impudence! Pray, <HI>Sawny,</HI> let us make a pause, and put a Case a Little: The same Case that was lately published by him that you call, the Old <HI>Second-Sighted Parson.</HI>
<Q>Suppose a Young Fellow should go from <HI>New-England</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to practice Physic; and being a meer Stranger, the MINISTERS should cherish him, and bring him into Credit; And then, suppose he should publish <HI>bitter, invectives,</HI> and scoffing <HI>Satyrs</HI> a∣gainst these Eminent MINISTERS, just such as you <HI>Sawny,</HI> have against our MINISTERS here: And then laugh at the People, for thinking them worthy to be consulted in <HI>Cases of Conscience,</HI> &amp;c. as you have done ours, and propose their <HI>banishment,</HI> or <HI>Indictment for Felony</HI>; and if the MAGISTRATES don't take Law of them, to scoff at them as <HI>Judicious Coxcombs.</HI> I say, <HI>Sawny,</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which is a very well govern'd Coun∣try, how would the poor <HI>New-Englander</HI> be dealt withal? I don't ask, whither the Government would send him; <HI>ken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e a Tolbooth, Sawny</HI>? But I ask, how would the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that love their MINISTERS treat him.—</Q>
But to proceed with your <HI>Malice.</HI> You propose that it is best for the <HI>Inoculates</HI> to convert their <HI>Incisions</HI> into <HI>Issues,</HI> and so <HI>continue them.</HI> This looks specious, and at first one would think you were giving <HI>good Advice</HI>: But then you propose, that if any of these be found in a <HI>Country Town,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002339_0022_0FDB2C0DD3063188"/>
with their Issues running on them (from whence by the way it was never yet known that any Infection was communi∣cated) the Discipline for MAD DOGS should be inflicted upon them. We know, <HI>Sawny,</HI> what Discipline you are for: tho' we have no <HI>Dogs</HI> in this Country, so <HI>mad</HI> as you are. I have not <HI>Malice</HI> enough in me to wish thee a Taste, <HI>Perillus,</HI> of thy own Proposal. Our good People bear with the Impudence of <HI>malepert Strangers,</HI> as no other People do; if they were not so very tame under their In∣sults; Thou <HI>Sawny,</HI> would not pass the Streets, without the Boys crying after thee, O BRASS! O BRASS!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why, if the English People are angry, when a Sc—n treats them so; I'le charge them with High Treason, as well as</HI> Felony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! he.—But <HI>Sawny,</HI> There comes a pang of Devotion upon thee, the only one in all thy Letter; thou saist, <HI>I desire to be thankful to GOD for the late Death's of several Inoculated.</HI> Methinks! this sounds a little <HI>maliciously.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>'Tis because it seems to put a step to the Career.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean the <HI>Career</HI> of saving the Lives of poor People. But, <HI>Sawny,</HI> of those Six or Seven that have died <HI>after Inoculation,</HI> out of about near Three Hundred that have been Inoculated, you can't name one that died truly <HI>of it</HI>; if the Circumstances, and Occasions of their Death were told, (too long to be inserted here, but it will be done, <HI>Sawny</HI>) it would prove a real Service, to the progress of the <HI>Career,</HI> you bestow your Curses on. As to <HI>two,</HI> which your <HI>party</HI> Clamour about, an ordinary Course of such <HI>Physic</HI> as you would have prescribed, would have had the same effect upon them, This method, <HI>Sawny,</HI> has been so universally Suc∣cessful, that none but such as are ignorant or malicious as you are, have questioned it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ignorant, <HI>Mr.—micus! I hope you won't charge me with Ignorance.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Sawny,</HI> of all the Pretenders to <HI>Physick,</HI> that ever wrote, there has none betrayed so much Ignorance. Thy <HI>Physical Blunders</HI> are innumerable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why; you won't say so!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Sawny,</HI> I do; and tho' I am no <HI>Physician,</HI> I can convict you of them, — But I'll single out but two, or three of them to cut thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for thee. In your <HI>first Li∣bel</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="002339_0023_0FDB2C1297065150"/>
you rail at Dr. BOYLESTON, for propagating the <HI>In∣fection of the Small-Pox,</HI> and in a few lines after say, <HI>the Ino∣culation produces nothing analogous to the Small-Pox</HI>: here is ignorance and inconsistency too! And then you learn∣edly Compare it, to the receiving the Oil of <HI>Tobacco</HI> into the mass of <HI>Blood,</HI> which you say may be received by the <HI>Stomach</HI> or <HI>Lungs</HI> without any prejudice. In your last Li∣bel, you talk like an Apothecary, and learnedly tell us that, <HI>all Constitution Distempers have some Idea, in ev'ry drop of our Juices, and so other Chronical distempers from the Person from whom the pocky matter is received are communicated unto the Person Inoculated.</HI> But <HI>Sawny,</HI> I suppose it will convey the <HI>Toothach</HI> too. And if the <HI>Pus</HI> was taken from you, <HI>Sawny,</HI> I fear the Person would be Inoculated which <HI>Lyes, Malice, Ignorance</HI>; for all thy juices are filled with the Idea's of them. And then, (for thou art a mighty Self-consistent Spark <HI>Sawny</HI>) you afterwards learn∣edly propose, that <HI>Inoculation</HI> (which you have all along represented, as <HI>Infecting the whole Body</HI> with all imaginable Venom) <HI>may be ordered by Act of Parliament as an Ad∣aequate Succedaneum to the Genuine Small-Pox to purify the Blood from the remaining faeculency.</HI> Was there ever such a Blockhead? But I'll supersede the other Discoveries of your Skill, with the mention of but <HI>two</HI> more.</P>
<P>You say that, <HI>Whatever ails the Inoculated in the after course of their Lives, may be subject to; the Blame will be laid on their former Inoculation.</HI> Here's ignorance and malice too. If they have ever taken any Physic of thee <HI>Saw∣ny,</HI> they would have a much better Cause to lay it to. How very Prodigal of their lives must the People be, that will venture them in the hands of such a woful Physician!</P>
<P>And there is one Instance of thy Superlative skill, <HI>Sawny,</HI> that is very notorious. I have often enough heard thee ri∣dicul'd for it. When the Patients are in the <HI>utmost danger</HI> thou seest nothing of it; nor sayest any thing to prepare their Friends for it; yea, when they are actually dying and within two or three hours of Death, thou bearest their Friends in hand, <HI>that there's no such matter.</HI> There are many can tell enough of thy performances this way. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You can't mean me, Mr. Demicus. For</HI> Dr. MA∣THER, <HI>and Parson</HI> COLMAN <HI>too, have recommended me to the Esteem of the People.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="002339_0024_0FDB2C1496711A18"/>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Sawny,</HI> you came recommended to <HI>them,</HI> and they were so Credulous (as you call them) to hope well, and speak well of you. But you were so well known, they could procure you little practise, and accordingly you took a Voyage, but soon returned; where at last by their means you got a <HI>little Credit.</HI> However, but little notice was ta∣ken of you, till your <HI>Opposition</HI> to <HI>Inoculation,</HI> made you famous. And yet, you were one of the most unsuccessful PHYSICIANS in the Town. When there dyed above 700 People in this Town within three Months, how many were your unhappy <HI>Patients</HI>? Though at the same Time, GOD was pleased to Succeed Dr. BOYLESTON to a wonderful degree, in his Patients that laboured under the <HI>Common In∣fection,</HI> besides those of <HI>Inoculation.</HI> And <HI>Sawny,</HI> are you not ashamed now, to treat the Gentlemen that took such pains to introduce you into all your <HI>practise,</HI> like a warmed <HI>Rattlesnake.</HI> I hope such a Monster of Ingratitude, will warn them from being too <HI>Credulous</HI> in encouraging Strangers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I hate to bear any more of this, I impatiently wait for some further Accounts from London.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if the Accounts be not just as you would have them, You'l say they are a <HI>a Contrived Story of some Ino∣culating Parson; A Dream; or Second Sight.</HI> However, we have very full Accounts from <HI>London</HI>; especially in a Book of Dr. HARRIS's, an <HI>Abstract</HI> from which has been lately published by Dr INCREASE MATHER, what would you have more? If you were a Lump of <HI>Brass, Sawny,</HI> you must blush what this great Man has written so directly con∣trary to you. But I am weary with talking with you, except thy Brother <HI>Mundungus,</HI> I know not another such conceit∣ed &amp; lying Coxcomb in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Nay; you have highly affronted me, in yoking me with such a sorry Fellow.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AC.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Neither a barrel, a better herring</HI>: And you doubt∣less must have a peculiar respect and veneration for him, or you would never have quoted him as you do. Why, he's the only <HI>living</HI> Author you quote, <HI>Sawny.</HI></P>

<P>THe <HI>Author</HI> of this <HI>language</HI> is one MUNDUNGUS; who tho' he moves in the dark, and smoaky Sphere of a <HI>Tobacco-Cellar,</HI> has a very <HI>diffusive</HI> Light; and has lately blessed the whole Country, with two Superlatively excellent, and <HI>matchless</HI> Treatises; in which we may ven∣ture to say, he hath set the Scriptures in a very <HI>new Light</HI>: and discovered a profound knowledge in the <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sci∣ences.</HI> This his <HI>Language</HI> is without controversy very <HI>nice</HI> and curious: And we know none so proper to be declared, the <HI>Universal Language.</HI> And since he has so honoured this part of the World, as first to impart it to <HI>us</HI>; we humbly conceive, some public <HI>marks</HI> of Honour ought to be conferred upon him: and we propose, that he be pre∣ferred <HI>Prosessor</HI> of <HI>it,</HI> among the <HI>Sons of Harvard</HI>; his <HI>Language</HI> be inrolled into the Number of the <HI>learned Tongues,</HI> and his <HI>Manuscript</HI> be preserved as a Valuable <HI>Cu∣riosity</HI> in the <HI>Library</HI>; tho' two or three pages of it, we think ought to be exactly transcribed and sent to <HI>Peters∣burgh</HI> as a <HI>Key</HI> to the 3 Volumes, lately carried there by the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Travellers. And further, <HI>whither</HI> he should not be constituted <HI>Censor</HI> of the Age, and <HI>Imprimator</HI> of the Press? And be desired, to write a <HI>Spelling-Book,</HI> for the use of the <HI>Schools</HI> since he has rendered STRONG and WATTS, &amp;c. altogether useless.</P>
<P>And since <HI>it</HI> is so <HI>Rhetorical</HI> and persuasive, we move that, he be the <HI>Prolocutor</HI> in all public Assemblies, and Associations of the <HI>People.</HI> And now, since we have enter∣ed his Praises, we can't pass by his profound skill in <HI>Logic,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>

be ordained <HI>Moderator</HI> of all disputes, controversies, and <HI>publick Acts.</HI> He is also very expert in <HI>Physic,</HI> and Medicine, and can by two principles alone, i. e. <HI>Sempeti</HI> and <HI>Anthepeti</HI> explain the most abstruse secrets of Nature; therefore we propose that an <HI>Infirmary</HI> be erected for him, that so he may <HI>Head</HI> all the <HI>Invalids</HI> in the Country: tho' pro∣bably the new Brick <HI>Edifice</HI> in the <HI>Common,</HI> may do for the present. He has also discover'd so great a knowledge in <HI>Divinity</HI> that we move he be elected CONSCIENCE-KEEPER-GENERAL of the Country; and all Cases of difficulty be referred to him; and if any MINISTER shall meddle without his Liberty, it shall be deemed <HI>a going out of his line,</HI> and he shall be obliged to pay <HI>fourfold</HI> for the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r'd</HI> Breeches. And whereas his Skill in <HI>Politicks</HI> is so very profound, as with one <HI>single glance</HI> to discover the Origin of all <HI>State Differences,</HI> &amp;c. we move that, his <HI>Bugget</HI> be hung up in the <HI>State House,</HI> and consulted upon all difficult Emergencies.</P>
