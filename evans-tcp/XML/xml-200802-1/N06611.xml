<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>AINT <HI>Paul</HI> by Nation was a <HI>Jew,</HI> by civil Dignity and Pri∣vilege he was a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen, by Profession he was a Christian, and by Office a Minister and an Apostle of Christ, and this was his highest Dignity and Honour. He had been bred a Pharisee, and was an eager and violent Persecutor of the Christian Cause, but after his Conversion, he was an ardent and zealous Promoter and Preacher of that Faith which once he destroyed; which laid him open and expos'd him, to the furious Resent∣ment and Rage of his Countrymen the <HI>Jews,</HI> who now rose upon him, in a riotous and tu∣multuous
<PB N="6" REF="008386_0005_102F1A7EAF3D6A10"/>
Manner, in the Temple, whilst he was peaceably employed there—apprehended him, beat and abused him, in a very injuri∣ous and shameful Manner, 'till he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Chief Captain with a Band of Soldiers, and ordered to be carried into the Castle; and being come upon the Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, he there stood, and having obtain'd Leave, he made admi∣rable Defence of himself, by a particular Re∣cital of the Manner of his past Life, and the wonderful Circumstances of his Conversion to Christianity: where upon the <HI>Jews</HI> were filled with accumulated Fury and Rage; they lift up their Voices—away with this Fellow from the Earth—they cried out, and cast Dust into the Air. In the midst of this riotous up∣roar, when some cried one thing, and some a∣nother, among the Multitude, the chief Cap∣tain commanded him to be brought into the Castle, &amp; ordered that he should be examined by Scourging, that if possible he might find out what the Business was, and wherefore they they thus cried out against him, presuming that by this Method, he might extort a true Con∣fession: accordingly they bound him with Thongs. At this critical Juncture, Saint <HI>Paul</HI>'s Freedom &amp; civil Immunities, as a Citizen of <HI>Rome,</HI> were of great Advantage to him: He says to the Centurion that stood by v. 25. is it lawful for You to Scourge a Man that is a
<PB N="7" REF="008386_0006_102F1A8164572578"/>
<HI>Roman,</HI> &amp; uncondemened? This Question im∣ports a strong &amp; clear Negation. The same Truth likewise is suggested, and weight laid upon it in the Sixteenth Chapter of <HI>Acts,</HI> where we are told, that after <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Silas</HI> had been beaten, &amp; cast into Prison, the Magistrates sent Word to let them go, in Answer to whom, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> say v.37. <HI>They have beaten us o∣penly uncondemn'd being</HI> Romans, <HI>and have cast us into Prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily, but let them come Them∣selves, and fetch us out</HI>— let them come them∣selves, make up the Matter, and dismiss us honourably.</P>
<P>THE Freedom of <HI>Rome</HI> and a Right to the Privileges &amp; Immunities of that State was ac∣counted an high, distinguishing Honor. I shall not undertake to give a particular Detail of those Privileges: some of them are menti∣on'd here, which I shall take some Notice of. Saint <HI>Paul</HI> here complains, that he was Punish∣ed uncondemned &amp; without a Tryal: now, it was contrary to the Laws of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and so it is to the Laws of all well regulated States &amp; Kingdoms, to condemn or punish a Man without a fair, impartial Tryal, and the Accusers &amp; Accused had Face to Face, &amp; the accused have Liberty to answer for and defend himself: but in the present Case, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> had had no Tryal at all, but they fell upon
<PB N="8" REF="008386_0007_102F1A82EEF09618"/>
and abus'd him, in a riotous, tumultuary Man∣ner, which was a direct Violation, not only of the Laws of common Justice &amp; Equity, but of his civil Freedom &amp; Immunity as a Citizen of <HI>Rome</HI>: nor was this all, but they had bound and scourg'd or beaten him, from both of which he was exempted by the <HI>Roman</HI> Law. To bind or beat a <HI>Roman,</HI> or one who was free of that City, and intitled to the Privileges of it was by no means lawful: hence <HI>Cicero,</HI> in one of his Orations says, <HI>Facinus est vinciri Civem Romanum, Scelus verberari,</HI> that is, 'tis a great and heinous Crime, either to bind or beat a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen: if they were guilty &amp; deserv'd it, they had other Ways of punishing their Ci∣tizens, but Thongs &amp; Whips they accounted too dishonourable and shameful Methods of Punishment, and unbecoming the Dignity of <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens.</P>
<P>No Wonder then the Centurion, when he understood that Saint <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Roman,</HI> was alarmed at what had been done: he goes straightway to the Chief Captain, and informs him how the Matter stood, and desires him to take heed what he did: whereupon the Chief Captain went directly to <HI>Paul</HI> and said, tell me now seriously and honesty, are you a <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Citizen, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> answer'd frankly and truly, yes I am; the chief Captain replys to this Purpose, in the <HI>Text,</HI> why that seems hard∣ly
<PB N="9" REF="008386_0008_102F1A85AC7BB9D0"/>
probable, from the indifferent Figure and Appearance you now make, unless there has been some remarkable Change in your Cir∣cumstances; for I, who hold a considerable Post in the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, obtain'd that Free∣dom at an expensive Rate, &amp; for a greatSum of Money: <HI>Paul</HI> rejoins, I had no Need of making any such Purchase, for I was free-born, born to the Freedom of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and all the Privileges and Immunities of it; it descended to me from my Father, who was a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen before me.</P>
<P>THERE were several Ways of becoming free of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and being intitled to the Priviliges of it▪ one was by Purchase, so the chief Captain was made free: another was by Birth, so <HI>Paul</HI> came by his Freedom: and some were vested &amp; dignified with these Pri∣vileges, in Consequence and Reward of some signal Services they had done the <HI>Roman</HI> Go∣vernment; in this Way, 'tis probable eno' St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Father become free of <HI>Rome</HI>: for many of the <HI>Jews,</HI> by serving in the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, and signanzing themselves, were endowed with the Freedom and Immunities of Citizens of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Words, I apprehend, may well eno' give Rise to a brief Discourse on <HI>civil Liberty,</HI> and the Privileges, Rights &amp; Immunities that belong to a free State or Government, with a
<PB N="10" REF="008386_0009_102F1A89C043F288"/>
particular Application of it to this Government.</P>
<P>THE Source and Original of civil Govern∣ment, in General, is Divine and from GOD. The most high has sufficiently inform'd us in his Word, and from the Nature, Reason and Necessity of the Thing, that it is his Pleasure, civil Government should obtain among the Nation's of the Earth: but he has not seen fit to interpose, and expresly to fix &amp; determine in his Word, that this or that particular Mo∣del or Scheme of civil Rule &amp; Government, should obtain &amp; be observ'd, in this or the o∣ther Nation, or in any Nation; but has left that Matter, very much, to the Election and Choice of the several Communities; or, that Matter is over-ruled by a Train of providen∣tial Events, whence the several Nations and civil States of the Earth, are led to fix and settle in some one particular Form of Govern∣ment rather than another.</P>
<P>As we in this Colony are dependant upon, and hold the Charter of all our civil Privileges, from the Crown of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> it may not he improper, to take a very brief View of that Kingdom, with it's inestimable Privileges.</P>
<P>GREAT <HI>Britain</HI> is a limitted Monarchy, and is sometimes called, by political Writers, a Republic or Commonwealth, with a Prince at the Head of it: it is governed by Laws of
<PB N="11" REF="008386_0010_102F1A8CC9B57940"/>
their own making, and both King and People are bound and oblig'd to act and conduct themselves according to the Laws of the Realm. The <HI>British</HI> Legislature consists of three Branches, the King and two Houses of Parliament, without the Concurrence of each of which, no Laws can be made, and which mutually temper, assist and check each other.</P>
<P>HISTORIANS tell us, that this Form of Go∣vernment, for substance, has obtain'd in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> from the earliest Times, and the same Kind of Government was setled by the Northern Nations, in several Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> which they over-run in the Decline of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, and founded new States upon its Ruins: but those Governments on the Con∣tinent, as to the free Form of them, gradually degenerated into despotick and arbitrary; but in, <HI>England,</HI> it has been preserv'd, secur'd and improv'd. In the Time of the <HI>Saxon Hep∣tarchy,</HI> when <HI>England</HI> was divided into seven Kingdoms, the Government was free, and so it was after those Kingdoms were united into one: King <HI>William</HI> the first, a <HI>Norman,</HI> having conquer'd <HI>England,</HI> near Seven Hundred Years ago indeed establish'd an absolute Government there; but his Son <HI>William</HI> the second, to secure his Crown, solemnly promised to restore the ancient Government and Laws: and the same Promises were made by some of his Suc∣cessors,
<PB N="12" REF="008386_0011_102F1A8EA7B10E78"/>
but not well perform'd; which bro't on the War of the <HI>Barons,</HI> in which the No∣bility and People struggled hard to recover their Liberties, which at length were solemnly confirmed to them, by a Charter, which was called <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> or the Charter of Li∣berties, by King <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>SOME Attempts were made, by some suc∣ceeding Princes, to strip the People of their Privileges, or to curtall and lessen them; but they ever brought Misfortunes and Vexatlons upon Themselves, and sometimes the Loss of theirCrowns, or their Lives. When King <HI>Charles</HI> the first attempted to introduce arbitrary Go∣vernment, it blew up a Civil War, which en∣ded in the Loss of his Head: and when his Son King <HI>James</HI> the Second, took large strides towards arbitrary Rule, the Nation jealous of their Liberties, invited over the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>; upon which King <HI>James</HI> thought fit to abdicate the Throne &amp; Kingdom; and the Crown was Setled on the Prince &amp; Princess of <HI>Orange,</HI> by the Names of King <HI>Williams</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; by whose Means &amp; In∣strumentality it was, that the Crown was Set∣led on the present Royal Family, which GOD long preserve.</P>
<P>UPON the Accession of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> the Nation assembled in Par∣liament, took special Care, expresly to set
<PB N="13" REF="008386_0012_102F1A91748D1830"/>
down, and solemnly to declare and assert, the ancient, legal Rights, Liberties &amp; Privileges belonging to the Nation, which have been en∣joy'd to this Day, and we hope will long be enjoyed. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For the Historical Facts here related, see <HI>Rapin's</HI> History of England.</NOTE></P>
<P>THERE is no Nation now in <HI>Europe,</HI> nor on the Earth, whose Civil Government is like that of Great <HI>Britain</HI>—none that exceeds, perhaps none, that, in all Respects, equals it in Excellency. Now, as the Colony of <HI>Con∣necticut</HI> is dependant upon, and derives it's Being and all it's Privileges from the <HI>British</HI> Crown; and free and excellent Form of our Government, pretty nearly resembles that of our Mother-Country. The CHARTER of all our Civil Privileges was granted by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second: by which Charter, this Colony was made and constituted a Body Cor∣porate or Politick, with all the Rights and Immunities of a free People. The Legisla∣ture of the Colony is established, and a Me∣thod Setled for it's Subsistence &amp; Perpetuity. The Whole of this Legislative Body, consisting of two Houses, are elected and chosen annually by the free Men of the Corporation; who are under the Solemnity of an Oath, to give their Suffrages, according to their best Knowlege, in such a Manner as may conduce
<PB N="14" REF="008386_0013_102F1A95754596A8"/>
to the best Good of the Government. In the Hands of this Assembly is lodg'd, the Trans∣action and Management of the great Affairs of the Government, relating to the Peace, Secu∣rity and Prosperity of the whole Body: To them it belongs, to erect and establish Execu∣tive Courts, of whatever Denomination, for the Tryal of such Causes as may properly fall under their Cognizance; to settle &amp; fix their Powers, and regulate the Form &amp; Manner of their Proceedings: to them likewise it belongs, to make and enact Such Laws and Statutes,—to levy and raise such Taxes upon the Com∣munity, and impose such Customs &amp; Duties, as may be needful for the Security of the People in their Lives, Property and Rights, for the Support of Government, &amp; the Peace and Welfare of the State.</P>
<P>Our Governors and Civil Rulers are not obtruded upon us from abroad, nor forced upon us by a Superior Authority: they are all elected &amp; chosen by Ourselves, and from among Ourselves. The Laws we are under, and which obtain among us, are not the So∣vereign Injunctions of an arbitrary Ruler; but they are all Laws of our own making—all e∣nacted and made by Ourselves, or by those, whom we have chosen to represent and act for us: Our Lives and Limbs, our Property and Estates, our Rights and Liberties, our
<PB N="15" REF="008386_0014_102F1A98715C94D8"/>
Characters and good Names lie at no Man's Mercy; but they are all guarded &amp; secur'd by Laws: as Strong an Hedge is set around them for their Security &amp; Defence, as we can desire; for they are screen'd &amp; defended by Laws of our own chusing &amp; making. And whatever is needful and proper to be done, from Time to Time, for the Suppressing of Disorders and Immoralities, or Practices and Courses that are detrimental to the Communi∣ty; for the promoting of Virtue and good Manners, Diligence and Industry, and the general Good, Security &amp; Prosperity of the State; still' this lies with us, and may be done by those whom we choose to rule over us. In a Word, we Ourselves elect &amp; chuse those, to whom annually the Conduct and Management of the great Affairs of Govern∣ment is committed, and whose Duty and Business it is, to watch for the Security, Peace and Prosperity of the State.</P>
<P>Now, one would be ready to imagine, that the Subjects of such a Government, of such rich and distinguishing Privileges &amp; Immuni∣ties, should be all Gratitude and Thankfulness to God, for his merciful Indulgence and dis∣criminating Favours—all Chearfulness and A∣lacrity in obeying &amp; honouring the Laws, and submitting to the Administrations of such a Government: but the most valuable &amp; Ex∣cellent
<PB N="16" REF="008386_0015_102F1A9A019F0618"/>
Things in the World, are capable of being perverted and abused; and so are the Civil Freedom &amp; Privileges of this Colony.</P>
<P>PERVERSE &amp; disingenuous Spirits, unrea∣sonable &amp; unthinking Men, by basking long in the Sun shine of Liberty, and indulg'd to the full with the richest Political Privileges, and unacquainted with the opposite state and situation, are ready sometimes to flight and despite their Freedom, and turn their Political Grace and Favour into Wantonness: and if all the Public Affairs are not ordered &amp; con∣ducted, in a Manner that suits their Humours, how unreasonable soever; or, if they feel a Burden heavier than common, at an extra∣ordinary Juncture—a Burden absolutely ne∣cessary, to the Security and Defence, not of their civil Liberties &amp; Property only, but of their Religion &amp; Lives, are ready to imagine their Freedom &amp; Liberties are worth Nothing at all; to murmur &amp; complain; to call for Chains &amp; Shackles, to curse their Benefactors, revile the Gods, and Speak Evil of Dignities, and with tremendous Rashness, to censure and condemn the whole Legislative Body of the Colony, and reproach &amp; vilify their Admi∣nistrations. I hope indeed there are few if any Such Murmurers &amp; Complainers in this numerous Assembly. We are called indeed to Liberty, but not to Licentiousness; we
<PB N="17" REF="008386_0016_102F1A9CDDF236C8"/>
have full Liberty to do all the Good we can in our Places, and to serve GOD and our Ge∣neration, in the Secure, unmolested Possession and Enjoyment of our Lives &amp; Property, and all our just Rights; but we have no Right or Liberty to do wrong. The Temper &amp; Con∣duct now hinted at, I am persuaded, is a great and heinous Sin, highly provoking to that GOD, by whom Kings reign and Princes de∣cree Justice; and who rules in the Kingdoms of Men, and gives them to whomsoever he pleases: besides, it is a very great political Evil; it tends to weaken the Hands, &amp; dis∣courage the Hearts of our Political Fathers, who are watching &amp; labouring for our Good,—to cause the Publick Affairs, to go on hea∣vily, &amp; under great Disadvantage &amp; Discou∣ragements— to enervate &amp; weaken the Civil State, &amp; to expose us to the Insults of our E∣nemies,&amp;throw us at last an easier Prey into their Hands. O let us all stand at a Distance from such a Temper &amp; Conduct, hate &amp; ab∣hor it, &amp; endeavour in all proper &amp; prudent Ways to discountenance &amp; suppress it, where∣ever it appears; Sensible that is not only a heinous Sin against GOD, but of pernicious and fatal Tendency, as to the Community and Civil State.</P>
<P>IN stead of the above Spirit &amp; Behaviour, let us all be persuaded gratefully to resent, and
<PB N="18" REF="008386_0017_102F1AA1039315B8"/>
wisely to improve our civil Freedom and Liberty. As we are signally favoured and distinguish'd by GOD, in the excellent Temper &amp; Constitution of our Civil Govern∣ment <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is no more a perfect Civil Constitution, than there is a perfect Man to be found upon the Earth; that is the most perfect, which is attended with few∣est Inconveniences, &amp; best answers the great Ends of Government. One of the Inconveniences that at∣tend a free Government, such as this, is, that the People sometimes, either thro Ignorance or Prejudice or Caprice, or being wrough upon by the artful Ap∣plications of designing Men, drop from the Administra∣tion their ablest States-men &amp; warmest Benefactors. Gentlemen of approved Capacity &amp; Fidelity, &amp; that at a Season, when they stand in greatest need of them: but in such Case, I think, they are commonly wont to be soon sensible of their Mistake, and to restore them to their Stations of Eminence &amp; Trust, perhaps with Advantage to their future Reputation &amp; Honour.</NOTE> and the Privileges and Immunities claimed under it; we ought, I think, in all Reason, to take some Pains to bring Ourselves acquainted with the Liberties &amp; Privileges we enjoy; how they differ from, and exceed in Excellency those, of almost all other Countries and Civil Communities on Earth: that, be∣ing sensible of their Worth, Preciousness and inestimable Value, we may learn to esteem and prize them very highly: and in Consequence thereof, our Hearts, deeply impress'd with a Sense of their vast Importance &amp; unspeakable Value, may glow with sincere Gratitude, and
<PB N="19" REF="008386_0018_102F1AA3FA793918"/>
our Lips over flow with Thanksgiving and Praises to the blessed GOD, the Fountain and Father of all Good; and we may be confirm'd and establish'd in our unshaken Loyalty and Obedience to the Crown of great <HI>Britain</HI> from which we hold and enjoy so great Privileges.</P>
<P>THE Light of this joyful Day, one would think, should serve to awaken these grateful and becoming Sentiments in all our Minds.—a Day, on which the Suffrages of this Cor∣poration are bro't into View, and the free, E∣lection of our Civil Rulers for the ensuing Year is determined—Suffrages not given, I hope, at Random &amp; without Consideration; for they were given, all given under Solemn Oath: yes, we are bound by Interest, Duty and the Solemn Oath of GOD upon us, to give our Suffrages, from Year to Year, for those to rule over us, who, according to our bes Knowlege &amp; Understanding, are best quali∣fied to fill those Places of Honour &amp; Trust to which they are to be prefer'd — most fit to Support their own Characters, and most likely, in Conformity to the great End of Govern∣ment, to employ their Power most effectually for the Good of those, who are to live under the Shadow of it: they must be able Men—Men of Genius, Penetration and Wisdom — Men of Steadiness, Courage &amp; Resolution —
<PB N="20" REF="008386_0019_102F1AA5C45F04C0"/>
Men of Virtue, Religion and Piety and true Fearers of GOD, Friends to <HI>Zion,</HI> and who prefer <HI>Jerusalem</HI> above their chief Joy; who will be a Terror to evil Doers, and a Praise to those that do well; they must be Men of Truth and unshaken Fidelity, Uprightness, Honor &amp; Sincerity — hating Coveteousness, of a public &amp; generous Spirit, Friends to the Constitution &amp; Government, firmly attach'd to it's true Interest, free &amp; ready to exert and lay out Themselves to promote &amp; advance it: those Persons among us, in whom these Cha∣racters are the most visible and conspicuous, ought to be elected &amp; chosen to rule over as from Year to Year: And being chosen and fix'd in their Stations of Honor &amp; Trust, their Duty &amp; Business is, to watch for the publick Good, &amp; exert all their Abilities, to promote and advance it; to approve themselves Fa∣thers &amp; Benefactors to their Country, and Mi∣nisters of GOD to us for Good.</P>
<P>AND answerably to their high Trust and Authority, and our Relation to them, we stand bound by the Laws of Heaven, to the Dis∣charge of various Duties to our Civil Rulers, to those whom we freely chuse to be set in Au∣thority over us: and those Duties we must discharge, faithfully discharge, or we cannot be said to make a right Use &amp; Improvement of our Civil Freedom, &amp; political Rights and
<PB N="21" REF="008386_0020_102F1AA74BC4EC98"/>
Immunities, but to pervert and abuse them. We are bound then to treat the Fathers of our Land with a disitinguish'd, deferential Respect &amp; Honour—with Esteem and Honour in Pro∣portion to their Station, Dignity &amp; Character. <HI>Fear GOD, Honour the King.</HI> Honour and Fear must be given, to whom they are due. We are to guard strictly and conscientiously against all ungrounded Jealousies &amp; Surmises, and rash Censures of their Administrations: always remembring, that every private Person is not in a Situation or Capacity to discern the Reasons &amp; Foundation of public Counsels and Administrations, or to form a right Judgment of them: in stead of this, we are bound to treat those, whom GOD in his Providence has Set over us, with great Respect, Honour and Reverence: nor is this all; we must chearfully obey their Laws and Commands, and Submit to their Orders and Administrations. They are cloathed with Authority from GOD to rule and govern, and it is our indispensable Duty to be loyal &amp; obedient. Hear the Lan∣guage of Inspiration; <HI>Let every Soul be Sub∣ject to the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of GOD; the Powers that he are ordain'd of GOD. Whosoever resisteth the Power, re∣sisteth the Ordinance of GOD; and they that resist shall receive to themselves Damnation. Ye must needs be Subject, not for Wrath, but for

The honourable Support of Ma∣gistracy is not an arbitrary Thing, which the Community may do or neglect at their Plea∣sure, without Sin or Danger; it is a necessary Piece of Justice, necessary by the Law of Na∣ture &amp; Revelation; both of which concur, in requiring us to give unto <HI>Caesar</HI> the Things that are <HI>Caesar</HI>'s, as well as unto GOD the Things, that are GOD's. We are obliged likewise sincerely and servently to Pray for those in Authority over us, and for the Bles∣sing of Heaven on their Persons &amp; Adminis∣trations. Their Work is great &amp; important, their Difficulties, Discouragements &amp; Temp∣tations many; and the Welfare &amp; Prosperity of the People, yea of every Individual of the Community is concern'd, in the wise &amp; faith∣ful Discharge ot their Trust: and they need Light &amp; Direction from above: We are there∣fore from Time to Time to bear them upon our Hearts before the Mercy Seat, and strive together in our Prayers to GOD for them, that
<PB N="23" REF="008386_0022_102F1AAF266FEB88"/>
they may be Ministers of GOD to us for good. Look into the Book of GOD, and you will find written, <HI>I exhort therefore that first of all, Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men, for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godliness and Honesty, for this is good &amp; ac∣ceptable in the sight of GOD our Saviour</HI>: and in all proper &amp; suitable Ways, we are to en∣courage the Hearts and strengthen the Hands of our Rulers, and endeavour to render their Administration &amp; Government over us, easy, prosperous and successful.</P>
<P>AND if we would improve our Civil Free∣dom &amp; Liberty as we ought, 'tis likewise high∣ly incumbent upon us, to shun &amp; avoid all such Courses &amp; Practices, as are hurtful and detri∣mental to the Civil State, tend to weaken and enervate it, and expose and lay it open to the angry Resentments &amp; desolating Rebukes of the righteous Governor of the World; as cer∣tainly all sinful and immoral Courses do: and to cultivate and practice all those sacred Vir∣tues &amp; Duties, which give Strength, Firmness and Stability to the Body Politic, and greatly conduce to our Security, Peace and lasting Tranquility.</P>
<P>AND now, what shall I say, to induce and engage us all to a ready and chearful Compli∣ance with these Serious and, I hope, seasonable
<PB N="24" REF="008386_0023_102F1AB1E2A61248"/>
Advices. Consider, 'tis the Body, the Com∣munity to which we Ourselves belong, and of which we are Members, whose Cause I am now pleading: and how unnatural, how mon∣strous would it be, to wound this Body, to in∣jure this Community, or to do any Thing to dishonour and endanger it; or, not to do all in our Power to advance it's Security, Peace and Prosperity? If our civil Privileges were trivial and of little Value, or, if we liv'd un∣der an arbitrary and tyrannical Government, the Case would be widely different. Arbitrary Rule or Tyranny is one of the greatest En∣gines of Misery &amp; Desolation to Mankind—the most dreadful Curse that ever blasted and devour'd the Earth: but we, of God's distin∣guishing Goodness and Mercy, are called to Freedom &amp; Liberty. Liberty! how charm∣ing, how animating is the Sound? may we never know it's Worth and inestimable Value by being strip'd and depriv'd of it. 'Tis one of the richest Gifts of Heaven to the Sons of Men—the source and spring of almost every Thing, that is excellent &amp; valuable upon Earth—the Nurse of Arts and Sciences, the Parent of Diligence &amp; Industry, the Procurer of Wealth and Riches, &amp; needful to the unmolested Pro∣fession and Practice of Christianity it self: it adds Chearfulness, Ease and Alacrity to the Mind—Sweetens &amp; endears the Social Life,
<PB N="25" REF="008386_0024_102F1AB36A6535E0"/>
and heightens the Relish of all the common Enjoyments of Time. And shall we not va∣lue Freedom? shall we not prize our civil Li∣berties? and heartily thank GOD for them, and improve them well? Certainly, if we do not, we are of all Men the most inexcusable.</P>
<P>WHAT can those unhappy Persons mean, who are Sick of our Liberties, chagrin'd and out of Humour, and seem willing to part with them? This must proceed from great Igno∣rance &amp; Stupidity. Do they know what it is to be denied Civil Liberty, and to lie at the Mercy of an Arbitrary Ruler? I shall say no∣thing of the <HI>Asiatick</HI> Nations, where arbitrary Rule &amp; Tyranny have their full swing, &amp; the Inhabitants by Millions are oppress'd &amp; crush'd under it's Weight; but I shall mention one In∣stance in <HI>Europe,</HI> to illustrate this Matter. In the Pope's temporal Dominions in <HI>Italy,</HI> by a fixed &amp; setled Rule or Order, which may not be transgress'd, all the People are oblig'd to de∣liver all the Grain they raise to the Pope's A∣gents, at half Price, to be deposited in the Ec∣clesiastick Chamber, as they call it, out of which it is bought by the Bakers, at double the Price, and by them it is made into Broad, &amp; Sold at their advanc'd Price to the People; so that they who raised the Grain, are oblig'd to buy their Bread, at more than Double the Price,, at which they Sold, &amp; were oblig'd to sell their Grain. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Burnet's Travels.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="008386_0025_102F1AB6257B8138"/>This is but one of the many Instances that might be adduced, of the Nature &amp; Misery of arbitrary Goverment: and how strikingly is this dark view contrasted to the chearing Light of Freedom &amp; Liberty! and it serves to show us the invaluable Worth &amp; Excellence of our Pri∣vileges: their Price is above Rubies. We may well say with the chief Captain, with a great Sum obtain'd we this Freedom. The <HI>British</HI> Nati∣on struggled hard, &amp; were at vast Expence of Treasure &amp; Blood, from Generation to Genera∣tion, to defend their Civil Liberties against the Attempts that were made to deprire them of them: and our Ancestors enterprized the Set∣tlement of this free Colony, at the Peril of their Lives: and yet we of this Generation may say too with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> that we were free born, born to Liberty: our Fathers died and went off the stage, with a chearful Hope, of transmitting their Privileges to the latest Generation: and shall we their Descendants be insensible of their Worth, wantonly &amp; madly throw them away, or misimprove and abuse them, or take such Courses, as may incur the Forfeiture &amp; Loss of them? by no Means: no, let those who are unacquainted with the Sweets of Liberty &amp; a free Government, reproah it, despise Dominion, and speak Evil of Dignities, &amp; foam out their own shame: but let us, who know better Things, whose Lines are fallen in pleasant Places,
<PB N="27" REF="008386_0026_102F1ABA93E936B8"/>
&amp; who have so goodly a Heritage, &amp; who have vowed Obedience to Christ the Prince of Peace—let us hear his Words &amp; obey them. <HI>Render to all their Due, Fear to whon Fear, &amp; Honour to whom Honour is due.</HI> Let us express an un∣shaken Loyalty, to our gracious and rightful King &amp; Sovereign, and a chearful and ready Subjection &amp; Obedience to our own Govern∣ment, Laws &amp; Administrations: and let us use our Endeavours to promote the Security, and advance the Welfare &amp; Tranquility of the Go∣vernment, by the serious Practice of Religion and Piety &amp; every social Virtue; and by cul∣tivating Peace, Unity &amp; Harmony among ourselves: so may we humbly hope, that the GOD of our Fathers will still be our GOD, will pro∣tect &amp; bless &amp; Save us, will be the shield of our Help, &amp; the sword of our Excellency, that he will ride upon the Heavens for our Help, and in his Excellency on the Sky. And happy is that People that is in such a Case; yea, hap∣py is that People whose GOD is the LORD.</P>
<P>BUT this being a critical &amp; important Junc∣ture, when our Liberties and Privileges, dear and valuable as they are, yea, our Property, our Religion &amp; our Lives are struck at, by an insidious &amp; powerful Enemy, with whom we have long been involv'd in an expensive and bloody War; and who are pushing with all

their Might, &amp; exerting all their Force &amp; Po∣licy, to strip us of all that is dear to us upon Earth, &amp; in the Room thereof, (if our Lives, are given us as a Prey) to throw Chains and Shackles upon us, and to reduce us, to the most abject &amp; dismal Slavery; it is par∣ticularly incumbent upon all Orders &amp; Ranks of Men among us, at this Time, to endeavour to divest themselves of mean &amp; low &amp; selfish views, &amp; to imbibe and cultivate a catholick and publick Spirit, and a dear Love &amp; Affec∣tion to their Country, in which they are endow∣ed and dignified with such rich and precious Privileges, &amp; to exert themselves, in their pro∣per Spheres, with uncommon Alacrity &amp; Vigor for it's Defence and Tranquility: You will therefore bear with me, If I go on to rouse; a publick Spirit, and an ardent Love to our Country, and a due Regard to the Privileges of it, and a correspondent Conduct and Be∣haviour in all Orders of Men.</P>
<P>A public Spirit, and the Love of one's Country, in all Ages and Nations, has been acknowleged and celebrated as a most impor∣tant &amp; laudable Virtue. The Savage &amp; un∣letter'd Nations cannot but acknowlege &amp; ex∣tol' this, as a most noble Virtue: and the anci∣ent, polite Nations of <HI>Greece</HI> &amp; <HI>Rome</HI> , Set this Virtue in the strongest &amp; most amiable Point of Light, &amp; extol it as a most eminent, noble
<PB N="29" REF="008386_0028_102F1AC16027CFC0"/>
and God-like Accomplishment. They ima∣gined, a Person could hardly recommend him∣self as a Friend to his Species, but by loving his Country, and expressing that Love in suit∣able and Proper Ways: hence those, among the <HI>Romans</HI> &amp; <HI>Grecians,</HI> who were inspir'd with this noble Ardor, would chearfully hazard every thing that related to themselves, to Save their Country, and advance it's Prosperity—would throw themselves by Hundreds, by Thousands upon the Edge of the Sword, when their Coun∣try was in Danger, for it's Security: and those who signalized Themselves, by noble Exploits, in the Defence of their Country, were loaded with Honour &amp; Praises. And if this generous Love of their Country, &amp; laudable Spirit to de∣fend it, was so conspicuous among the Heathen, would it not be an inexcusable Reproach upon Christians, if this noble Ardor and the proper Effects of it, should be found wanting among them? Consider what does your Country in∣clude? This dear Circle incloses all on Earth that is ours—all in this World, that ought to be the most dear to us. On this Spot of Earth, the great Father of the Universe has Station'd us, to act our Parts for Eternity: here the Word and Gospel of Jesus is put into our Hands: here the Churches &amp; Schools of Christ are o∣pened, his Word preach'd, and his Ordinances administred, in Order to our being train'd up
<PB N="30" REF="008386_0029_102F1AC2E7387760"/>
and fitted for Heaven: here our Civil Liberties and Privileges are enjoyed, such as we can ne∣ver prize too high, never improve too well: here our worldly Interest &amp; Estates lie—our Families, &amp; all that is dear to us in this World. And shall not our Country be lov'd &amp; valued by us? shall not this delightful, animating Af∣fection be found burning, with a Flame not to be extinguish'd, in every Breast? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Country flourishes &amp; improves in Strength, Security and Prosperity, our own Interests, civil &amp; religious are the more Safe, &amp; better Secur'd; but if our Country Suffers, we, as Members of this Body Suffer too; if it be destroy'd, what a Ruin and Desolation will it bring with it, upon all that is valuable &amp; dear to us upon Earth? What a Blessing is a publick Spirit, an enlarged, gene∣rous Disposition! 'Tis an amiable, excellent Dis∣position in it self, &amp; it speaks the Person, who is graced with it, to be one of the excellent of the Earth. The Good and Welfare of our Country is our greatest earthly Good, for our private Interests are involved in it, &amp; must stand or fall with it: and therefore in all Reason, our petty, personal Interests, ought to be subor∣dinated to the Good of the Public. We ought not to desire to thrive at the Expence &amp; Dan∣ger of the Public, and to erect our private For∣tunes &amp; Interest on the Ruins of our Country. A narrow, contracted Spirit, a Selfish, grovling
<PB N="31" REF="008386_0030_102F1AC4BA83D3F0"/>
Temper, is one of the basest, vilest and most despicable Properties, that can possess &amp; rule the Heart of Man: it would attract &amp; draw every Thing to it self, &amp; there it stagnates and dies, or is absorpt &amp; lost. Many an excellent and noble Design, for the Advancement of Re∣ligion, and the Kingdom of Christ, of Peace and Righteousness, &amp; for the Security &amp; Flou∣rishing of civil Communities &amp; Kingdoms, is clogged, suppress'd &amp; rendered abortive, by such a Selfish, sordid Spirit. This Spirit is the Bane of Communities on Earth, but then, for our Comfort, it is confin'd to the Earth, for 'tis certain, it will find no Place in Heaven. But a public Spirit, a temper &amp; Disposition to con∣sider and pursue our private Interest, in a just Subordination to the public Good, is a most ex∣cellent &amp; recommending Property, &amp; merits the highest Praises &amp; Commendations: Such a Spirit animating &amp; ruling a Person, renders him a public Blessing and Benefactor to his Country: 'Tis an heroic Spirit, a Patriot Vir∣tue, &amp; an Imitation of GOD, the great &amp; good Governor of the Universe, who Showers his Benedictions on all the Nations of the Earth.</P>
<P>I know well, 'tis not every Member of a Community, that has either Abilities, or a Call in Providence to Signalize himself, in great Exe∣ploits or Atchievements for the Benefit of his Country: but this <HI>Spirit,</HI> this Temper, in some
<PB N="32" REF="008386_0031_102F1AC776044AF8"/>
Degree, is what every one, I hope, is capable of; and so, in Proportion to their Opportuni∣ties &amp; Abilities, they may approve themselves Blessings &amp; Benefactors to their Country. This Spirit &amp; Temper is a very laudable &amp; Praise∣worthy Thing at all Times, but it never was more necessary, there never was a louder Call for it, in this Land, than in these dark and dangerous Times. Let us then shake off a contracted Selfish Disposition, open our Eyes, enlarge our Views, extend our Good will, and believe it, that our Country calls for our most cordial &amp; benevolent Regards: let every Heart be fir'd with a Love to our Country—a pub∣lic &amp; generous Spirit inspire and rule in every Breast. I am now inviting You, to shake off and abhor the meanest &amp; basest Temper, that ever vexed &amp; plagued the World, &amp; which is the spring &amp; source of innumerable Evils and Calamities to Mankind, &amp; to imbibe that Spirit, and cherish &amp; cultivate that Temper, which is the Beauty, the Ornament, the Nobility of the human Mind — is the spring of almost all worthy &amp; noble Designs in Church and State, renders a Man justly dear and honourable to the World, &amp; a Benefactor to human Kind. And can we, my <HI>Candid Hearers,</HI> can any of us fail, at this Juncture, to manifest our Love to our Counrty, and the high Estimate we put upon our precious Privileges, in all proper and
<PB N="33" REF="008386_0032_102F1ACC9D7A72A0"/>
requisite Ways, and all suitable Measures for it's Defence and Security. But perhaps you may be ready to say, the Scale is now turn'd, and a more hopeful and chearing Prospect, with Regard to the Event of the War, opens before us, than in Time past; thank GOD for it most heartily; but be not high minded, but fear, <HI>let not him that girdeth on his Harness boost himself, as he that putteth it off.</HI> The Race is not always to the Swift, not the Battle to the Strong. A vain-glorious Confidence in an Arm of Flesh, &amp; military Preparations (whilst the GOD of Armies is ovelook'd and dishonor'd) is the ready Way to Frustration and Ruin. The Event of the War will be as GOD pleases, He rules among the Kingdoms of Men, &amp; gives them to whomsoever he will. I am sure, we have still Reason, great Reason to fear &amp; be humble, to call our Sins to Re∣membrance, and repent in Dust and Ashes, to turn to GOD &amp; seek his Face &amp; Favour, and his merciful Interposition and Help, that he would go forth with our Armies and fight our Battles for us: let this be the grand Care of every one. And whilst our Civil Fathers and Patriots are studying for the public Weal, and with a steady Hand, &amp; an intrepid Heart, and all the Fore-thought &amp; Sagacity of governing Wisdom, are conducting the great Affairs of State, and consulting the Welfare of the Go∣vernment

Can you recollect the tragic Scenes ot Years past, your Forts demolished or burnt to Ashes, your Armies cut to Pieces, your Countrymen, in Multitudes, butcher'd and mangled—Can you look round from <HI>Monongabela</HI> to <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and see the scatter'd Bones of your Slaughtered Countrymen, whitening in the Sun to this Day, whilst their Blood, which the Earth has Swal∣lowed up, still cries to Vengeance—while these dismal Scenes rise to your View, can You, <HI>Gentlement,</HI> with all your Heroic Ardors about you, Sleep quietly in your Beds? When Providence Divine, in Accepts loud as Thunder calls you to Arms, can you but stand collected, stand ready to strain every Nerve, and to exert your best Efforts of military Genius Dexterity and Bravery in your Country's Cause?

Supreme Love to the GOD of your Fathers, an ardent Affection to your Country, and the true Spirit of Heroism, inspire and fill your Hearts: and by your happy Influence and Address, may the noble Ardor catch from Breast to Breast,'till the whole Army is warm∣ed and animated by the same excellent Spirit. When you consider what is at Stake, what our Fears are, what our Hopes, can your Zeal Sleep? No, gird on your military Har∣ness, draw forth the devouring Sword, banish Vice from the Camp, commit your Cause to GOD, in his Name set up your Banners, and in his Strength, we hope, you will tread down our Foes.
