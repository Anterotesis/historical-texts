<BIBL>I TIMOTHY II. 1, 2.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>I exhort therefore, that first of all; Suppli∣cations, Prayers, Intercessions, and Giving of Thanks, be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead a quiet, and peaceable Life, in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE End of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure Heart.</HI> And Acts of Kindness, and Good-Will to Men as the <HI>Off-spring of GOD,</HI> are the proper Fruits of Charity. When therefore our Minds are effectually Influenced by this God-like Vertue, instead of saying, <HI>go, be warmed, be filled;</HI> we shall sincerely Endeavour as we have Opportunity, <HI>to do good to all Men.</HI> But in as much as we
<PB N="2" REF="007407_0005_102BAE124D968BD0"/>
ha'n't the same Advantages, to shew the Effects of our Charity to some, as to o∣thers, (for some are raised to such a Pitch of Grandure, and Dignity, that they are above our Reach; others are at such a Distance from us; that we don't so much as know them, or the Nation they belong to; and our Enemies by their Perverseness, and ill Nature, may render themselves uncapa∣ble to receive Benefit by us;) the only way therefore for us to shew our Christian Tem∣per in such Cases, is by our fervent Addresses at the Throne of Grace on their Behalf. But whether we can actually do good to Men, or no; the great Duty of Intercession for o∣thers is not to be neglected; for the most that we (or indeed the very Angels themselves,) can do for them, is just nothing at all, in Comparison of that great Good, that GOD may bestow upon them, in Answer to our Prayers. We need not marvel therefore, that the Apostle speaks of this, as a Duty of such great Importance. <HI>I exhort therefore, that first of all, Supplications, Prayers, In∣tercessions, &amp; giving of Thanks, be made for all Men.</HI> We must pray for all Men, Friends, and Enemies, Relations and Strangers, Bond and Free. But as our own Peace, the civil and religious Interests of the Community, and the best good of Rulers themselves, de∣pend
<PB N="3" REF="007407_0006_102BAE1482BC1E78"/>
upon their Conduct; therefore we are especially <HI>to pray for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</HI> And we are directed what to pray for on their Account; <HI>viz.</HI> That they may be Influenced by GOD's Grace, and have his Blessing upon their Persons, and Administrations, that under their Protection <HI>we may lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI></P>
<P>There are sundry things of very great Importance, that we may observe from these Words. Particularly,</P>
<P>That civil Government is a divine Insti∣tution, and therefore we must pray for GOD's Blessing upon all that are in Authority, as being GOD's Ministers.</P>
<P>That the Work of Rulers is of great Con∣cernment, and attended with peculiar Diffi∣culties, and accordingly they stand in need of the Prayers of good Men.</P>
<P>That good Rulers are a great Blessing to a People, since under their Influence, and Protection, their civil and religious Interests are Secure; so that <HI>they may lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI></P>
<P>That the People owe Obedience, and Sub∣jection to then Rulers; without which they can have no Peace, Godliness, for Honesty.</P>
<P>That Subjects ought not only to acquiesce in, but be thankful for, the good Offices of
<PB N="4" REF="007407_0007_102BAE179617E240"/>
their Rulers; for Thanksgiving is to be joyned with Supplications, Prayers, and Intercessions.</P>
<P>That People are not animated with a christian Spirit, nor truly sensible of their own Interest, when they neglect to pray for their Rulers.</P>
<P>And that all Men ought to Improve the Advantages they enjoy under a good Go∣vernment, <HI>by leading a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI></P>
<P>Each of these Observations might be im∣proved as a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oper Entertainment, for such an Occasion as this; yet I shall not expa∣tiate upon either of them: But what I have chiefly in View as the Subject of my Dis∣course, is this;—</P>
<P>That when civil Rulers are influenced by the Grace of GOD, they will sincerely endea∣vour to promote not only the Peace, and outward Prosperity; but likewise the religi∣gious Interests of the People under their Government.</P>
<P>The Rulers of the World, when this E∣pistle was Written, were Heathen; and the great Thing that their Subjects were to pray for on their Behalf was, that they might be Converted, and so become sincere Christians, and then it would follow, that under their Government they might lead a quiet, and
<PB N="5" REF="007407_0008_102BAE1997B198F8"/>
peaceable Life, in all Godliness and Honesty. And we must now pray for <HI>them that rule over Men, that they may be just, ruling in the fear of God;</HI> for if this be their true Cha∣racter, we may rest Satisfied that their En∣deavours will not be wanting, to secure to us our just Rights, Civil, and Religious.</P>
<P>But that I may express my Sentiments upon this Subject, with as much Clearness, and Brevity as I can; I shall endeavour to show,</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> That the good of Society in this pre∣sent State, (next to the Glory of GOD,) is the direct End of civil Government.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Althô Religion is not the direct, and immediate Object, of the Concern of civil Rulers in their political Capacity; yet the good of Society can never be effectually promoted by them, unless they are sincerely concerned for the Interest of Religion.</P>
<P>And therefore,</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> When civil Rulers are influenced by the Grace of GOD, to do their Duty; they will sincerely endeavour to promote Religion; as there is such a necessary Con∣nexion, between this, and the good of Society.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> That the good of Society in this pre∣sent State, (next to the Glory of GOD,) is the direct End of civil Government. Go∣vernment
<PB N="6" REF="007407_0009_102BAE1B1A7E97C0"/>
was not appointed, that some Men might enjoy Riches, Dignity, and Power above others, exclusive of the good of the Public: That some might become as Beasts of Prey, to the weaker part of the Herd while others must be Beasts of Burden: That some might <HI>be clothed in Purple, and fine Linen, and fare Sumptuously every Day; while others must be fed with the Crumbs that fall from their Table.</HI> No; Societies were not formed for the sake of Rulers, but Rulers were made for the sake of Societies; that the good of all, (Rulers and Ruled) in Con∣junction, might be Promoted. And as civil Government was not appointed for the good of any Part of a Community, in Opposition to the Rest; so it was not design'd for the good of any Community as such, in the World to come. For thô <HI>the chief End of Man, is to glorify God and enjoy him for ever:</HI> And the chief End of Government, as well as all other Means that GOD is using with Men; is His Glory, and their everlasting Good; and therefore every Man, of every Community, ought to improve this, together with all other Advantages, that he may <HI>be made meet to be a Partaker, of the Inheri∣tance of the Saints in Light:</HI> Yet no Society as such will have a future Existence, <HI>in that Kingdom which can never be moved,</HI> and there∣fore
<PB N="7" REF="007407_0010_102BAE1D2E54BF90"/>
can receive neither Good, nor Harm, from this, or any thing else in that Respect. <HI>For when the Heavens shall pass away with a great Noise, and the Elements shall Melt with fervent Heat, and the Earth also, and the Works that are therein, shall be burnt up;</HI> When all Nature shall fall on Sleep, Time shall expire, and Death it self shall die; then Empires, and Kingdoms, and States, and Communities, shall be no more; but glorified Saints shall be united in another Manner of Society, <HI>when God will be all in all.</HI> But Men in this present State of Weakness, and Depravity, have a mutual Dependance one upon another, and can't Subsist without the Advantages of civil Society; and this necessa∣rily implies, that there must be some Govern∣ment: For an animal Body could as well live without an Head, as a political one could sub∣sist without Government. For without it we should be in a state of Confusion; like an Herd of wild Beasts; the Strongest, and most Mischievous, would Domineer over and Op∣press others. There would be <HI>no Peace, to him that should go out, or to him that should come in;</HI> our Lives, and Properties, and all that is dear to us, would hang in Suspence, and de∣pend upon the ungoverned Lusts of the Sons of Fraud, and Violence. When a People therefore grow uneasy under Government, and
<PB N="8" REF="007407_0011_102BAE202B7B06F8"/>
endeavour to overthrow the Foundations of it; they are like a Pond that being weary of Confinement, contends for Liberty, with the Dam upon which it depends for it's very Ex∣istence. Government is so necessary to the very Being of a Society; that it is not at all Probable, that ever any great Number of People continued long together, without it in some Form or other. To suppose (as some have done,) that Mankind were ever in such a mere State of Nature; as to have had no Laws, no Regulations, no sort of Government; is to suppose a Contradiction; for such a wild, and savage State, could not with any Propriety be called a State of Na∣ture; for it would be a very unnatural State. And therefore it follows that Government was not brought in by Improvement, and Cultivation, as the Arts and Sciences were. For thô it is true, the different Modes, and Forms, of it, (as they are suited to the Genius, Inclination, and Circumstances of every Community,) depend upon Agreement, and Compact: Yet Government itself, was instituted at the beginning of the World, by the great Author of our Natures; as is evi∣dent from the Word of GOD; and is even implied in those Words, <HI>It is not good the Man should be alone.</HI> For <HI>Adam</HI> was to have had a sort of Government over his Wife and
<PB N="9" REF="007407_0012_102BAE222BCEEF70"/>
over his Children, if they had been Born in Paradice: For the Fifth Commandment would have been binding then as well as now. But after <HI>that Sin entered into the World,</HI> and Mankind multiplied upon the Earth, the Necessity of it became more apparent. <HI>As known unto God therefore, are all his Works from the Beginning of the World;</HI> and as he had a tender Concern for Mankind as <HI>his Off-spring,</HI> he made Provision for our Peace, and Safety, under the Protection of them who are <HI>Ministers of God to us for good.</HI> As the civil good of the Community then, ought to be the great Thing aimed at by Rulers as such; so every thing that has a direct Ten∣dency to promote it, ought to be the imme∣diate Object of their Concern. There are many things that in their own Nature are absolutely Necessary to promote the good of Society; thô all of them come within the Compass of civil Liberty; or at least are implied by it.</P>
<P>Good Laws ought to be provided; being wisely adapted to the State, Situation, and Circumstances of the People, and being esta∣blished, and promulgated, they should be the Stated Rule of Government, and Obedi∣ence. Their Sovereign Authority over all Men, from the Lowest to the Highest, ought to be Supported; that the meanest Beggar,
<PB N="10" REF="007407_0013_102BAE23FB14BD98"/>
as well as the man in Power, may find Refuge under their Protection.</P>
<P>The Doctrines of the unlimited Power of Princes, to govern without Law, and of the Obligations that Subjects are under to submit to their lawless Determinations, upon Pain of eternal Damnation; were in Times past greatly in Vogue in our Nation, and taught for precious Gospel Truths.</P>
<P>But their mighty Zeal to propagate these Doctrines, by a vile Prostitution of Pulpits, Presses, and Courts of Justice, was (methinks,) but a poor way of complimenting the then reigning Princes, for it evidently implied a Consciousness that they were endeavouring to oppress their Subjects, by trampling the Laws under their Feet. But such was the blind Am∣bition of those worthless Princes, that instead of being affronted they were flattered by these Men; for they wanted such Instruments to car∣ry on their Designs. And if that Lawless Power which (like original Sin) was propagated from Father to Son, <HI>had not been sent to its own Place,</HI> by the glorious Revolution, and the happy Accession of the present royal Fa∣mily to the Throne; it would (long before now) have been more safe for Protestants to have dwelt in Turkey, than in any Part of the british Dominions. <HI>This is the Lord's doing, it is marvellous in our Eyes!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007407_0014_102BAE2704A1A370"/>
We find then by Experience, as well as from the Nature of Things, that there can be no civil Liberty, where the sacred Authority of the Laws is disregarded by any Order of Men. For as christian Liberty does not con∣sist, <HI>in turning the Grace of our God into Wan∣tonness;</HI> but in such due Obedience to the Laws of Christ, that <HI>we may Serve God without Fear, in Holiness, and Righteousness, all the Days of our Lives;</HI> so civil Liberty does not consist in Licentiousness; (a wanton abuse of Power on the one Hand, or a fearless Con∣tempt of Authority, on the other) but in such due Obedience of all Ranks, and Orders of Men, to the wise and good Laws of the State, that all Men, (Rulers, and Ruled,) that are free from Guilt, may be free from Fear; and may discharge the Duties of their respective Stations, and enjoy every thing that they have a Right to, without any Concern about <HI>a Lion in the Way, a Lion in the Streets.</HI> Civil Li∣berty therefore is so essentially necessary, that the great End of Government can never be ob∣tained, unless this be inviolably preserved.</P>
<P>In Order to which the Laws should not ly by like neglected Armour, but be duly, and im∣partially executed. Justice should be done, between Man, and Man; without Fear or Fa∣vour, without Bribes, multiplying Charges, or unnecessary Delay. No Special Pleadings
<PB N="12" REF="007407_0015_102BAE2909A65258"/>
should be admitted, when the Design is to keep the Merits of the Cause out of Sight; and to stop the Course of Justice. <HI>But Judg∣ment should run down as Waters, and Righte∣ousness as a mighty Stream.</HI></P>
<P>Transgressours of the Law should be pu∣nished, according to the Demerit of their Crimes; for their Amendment if they ben't incurable, and that others <HI>may hear, and fear.</HI> And Mercy should never triumph over Judg∣ment, unless in doubtful Cases, or when ex∣treme right may be extreme wrong.</P>
<P>Industry and Frugality ought to be promo∣ted, the Poor should be imployed, Children should be brought up to some proper Busi∣ness; that every Member of the Commu∣nity may serve it's Interests. Trade &amp; Na∣vigation should be encouraged, but withal du∣ly regulated, that a great Part of the Pro∣duce of a Country, that affords all the Neces∣saries of Life, ma'n't be foolishly bartered a∣way, for such things as only tend to promote Idleness, Luxury, and Intemperance; whereby they will unavoidably lose the Ballance of Trade, <HI>and Poverty will rush on like an armed Man.</HI></P>
<P>A fixed Medium of Trade should be pro∣vided, that Men may not defraud one another under Colour of Law; at the Expence of the public Faith, and Credit.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007407_0016_102BAE2B0C214150"/>
Schools and Colleges should be Supported, for the educating Youth in the learned Lan∣guages, and in the liberal Arts, and Sciences; <HI>that Darkness may not cover the Land, and thick Darkness the People;</HI> and that some may be fitted from Time to Time, for public improvement.</P>
<P>A mutual Dependance between every Part, and Member of the political Body, should be preserved; that the Head may direct, and influence the Members, and that all the Mem∣bers may be subject to the Head; and mutu∣ally assist each other. When ever this Depen∣dence is lost; so that <HI>the Eye says to the Hand I have no need of thee, and the Head says to the Feet, I have no need of you;</HI> the Light of civil Liberty will become dim, and the Health of the Body will be so impaired, that there will be a Stagnation of the vital Fluids, and every fatal Symptom of approaching Death.</P>
<P>And lastly, proper Measures should be con∣certed, for the Defence of the Lives, and Pro∣perties of the People, against the open Inva∣sions, or secret Attempts of Enemies; for thô no War ought to be made to gratify the Lust of Ambition, to obtain Dominion, or enlarge Territories, or even for the Propagating Re∣ligion itself: Yet self Defence is agreeable to the Law of Nature, and an Offensive War is lawful, so far as it is necessary, in the just De∣fence
<PB N="14" REF="007407_0017_102BAE2C8E497880"/>
of ourselves and others. The Doctrine of the unlawfulness of a Defensive War, which some have placed among the Articles of their Creed; is contrary both to the Old Testament and the New. When the Soldiers being concerned about their eternal Salvation, enqui∣red of John Baptist what they should do; he was so far from telling them that their Im∣ployment was unlawful, that he gave them Directions how they should behave in it. And when <HI>Peter</HI> was sent by the immediate Command of GOD, to instruct <HI>Cornelius</HI> the Centurian in the Doctrins, and Duties of the Christian Religion; he said nothing against the service he was in as a military Officer; but his whole Conduct shewed that he appro∣ved of <HI>his continuing in the Calling, wherein he was called.</HI> And by the Way, if ever it was lawful and necessary to draw the Sword, it ap∣pears to be so now; when our Religion, our Li∣berties, our Properties, our Wives, our Chil∣dren, and every thing that is dear to us, are in Danger of being buried under the Ruins of our Country. Must we as idle Spectators, behold one of the most treacherous, and en∣terprizing Nations in the World, surrounding us with an armed Force; fortifying themselves in our Provinces; destroying our Forts; and instigating the Savage Nations to joyn with them in murdering us in a Time of Peace?
<PB N="15" REF="007407_0018_102BAE2FD7503748"/>
Must we sit still, and tamely suffer our Coun∣try to be possessed, by Men who never knew the Pleasure of having any thing that they could properly call their own; our Towns to be filled with unwelcome Inhabitants; our Houses to become the Habitations of Cruel∣ty; our Wives and Children to be murdered, our Men to have their <HI>Garments rolled in Blood;</HI> our Churches demolished, or turned in∣to Mass-Houses; and our selves if suffered to breathe, to become the Servants of Servants; must we counteract all the sentiments of Hu∣manity; all the Principles of Self-Preservati∣on, all natural Affection for our Posterity, and all Concern for our Country, Friends and Neighbours? No, we have not so learned Christ; the Gospel it is true, requires us to love our Enemies, but it does not require us to ex∣press it, by being accessary to their Wicked∣ness, or by being cruel to ourselves, and to our Friends. But to return,</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Althô Religion be not the Direct, and immediate Object, of the Concern of civil Ru∣lers in their political Capacity; yet the good of Society, can never be effectually promoted by them, without being Sincerely concerned for the Interest of Religion. Civil Rulers considered as Men, and Christians, are under as great Obligations to be concerned about
<PB N="16" REF="007407_0019_102BAE31D9BB6ED0"/>
Religion, as any of their fellow Mortals; (the Ministers of Religion only excepted)</P>
<P><HI>They are by Nature Children of Wrath even as others.</HI> Thô David <HI>was raised up on high;</HI> yet he says, <HI>Behold I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> High, &amp; Low, have the same natural Depravity, the same evil Inclinations, the same Lusts &amp; Passions, the same Blindness of Mind, and Hardness of Heart. And Men in Power, are as unable to inlighten their own Minds, change their own Hearts, and renew their own Na∣tures, as other Men; and therefore stand in as much need of converting Grace, that they <HI>may be created a new in Christ Jesus to good Works, that they may walk in them.</HI></P>
<P>The Guilt of Sin will ly as heavy upon their Souls, as upon the Souls of others; and they never can have <HI>Peace with God,</HI> unless they <HI>are justified by Faith</HI> in a Glorious Redeemer.</P>
<P>The same Means, and Endeavours must be used by them, that are necessary for others; that they may <HI>perfect Holiness in the Fear of God.</HI></P>
<P>They are exposed to as great Temptations, and to as great Trials, and Afflictions; and therefore stand in as much need of the Com∣forts of Religion to Support them; <HI>that in the Multitude of Thoughts within them, God's Comforts may delight their Souls.</HI> They will
<PB N="17" REF="007407_0020_102BAE33DB7AB2D0"/>
find as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> others, that all Comforts that don't Spring from the true Fountain, will prove no better <HI>when their Tents are in Af∣fliction,</HI> than deceitful Streams, that will dry up when they most need them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

<BIBL>Night Thoughts.</BIBL></NOTE>
And <HI>it is appointed for them as well as for all other Men, once to die.</HI> Thô they <HI>are called Gods, yet their Dwelling is in Flesh; and they must die like Men.</HI> He that <HI>rides upon the pale Horse,</HI> will with as much Rudeness, and Violence, break into the Palaces of Princes; as into the Cottages of Beggars, and treat them with as little Respect, and Complaisance. And then they must appear before <HI>God the Judge of all, who will pour Contempt upon Princes, and not regard the Rich, more than the Poor; for they are all the Work of his Hands.</HI> Then, O then! they will be either <HI>found of their Judge in Peace,</HI> and be welcomed with that <HI>Euge, well done good and faithful Servants;</HI> or be driven away with that <HI>Anathema, take the unprofitable Servants, and bind them Hand and Foot, and cast them into utter Darkness; there shall be Weeping, and Gnashing of Teeth.</HI> So that if they ben't concerned about Religion, they show as great Stupidity as many other
<PB N="18" REF="007407_0021_102BAE355D1E8F30"/>
Men; <HI>who say let us eat and drink for to-mor∣row we shall die;</HI> and as much greater, as their Talents, and Advantages are greater, for which they must <HI>give an Account.</HI> But yet in their political Capacity, they are not properly the Ministers of Religion.—There is another Order of Men, who are appointed, and com∣missioned for this very End, that they may explain the great Things of Religion, and impress them upon the Minds, and Consci∣ences of Men; that in this Way, they may (as Instruments,) <HI>open Mens Eyes, and turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD; that they may re∣ceive Forgiveness of Sins, and Inheritance among all them that are Sanctified, by Faith which is in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>But althô in this Sense, civil Rulers have no Right to intermeddle with the things of Re∣ligion, by invading the ministerial Office; yet in another Intendment, they ought to be greatly concerned about Religion by Virtue of their Office; as they never can effectually promote the Peace, and Prosperity of the Community, without being concerned for the Interest of Religion. For if Rulers and Peo∣ple have no Religion, no fear of GOD, no Re∣gard to the Rewards, and Punishments of <HI>the World to come,</HI> what Security can they have? What Trust; what Confidence, can they put
<PB N="19" REF="007407_0022_102BAE38A3BA6C60"/>
one in another? Their firmest Promises will signify nothing; and their most solemn Oaths, will bind them no more than so many Cob∣webs. Without Religion civil Society must disband; or prove no better than a Combi∣nation of Pirates, and High-way-men, who agree to rob and plunder others, and then treat one another by the same inhuman Maxims, of Fraud, and Violence. From whence come Murders, Treasons, Rebellions, Seditions, Frauds, and Oppressions? From Religion? No; but from the want of it. Who are <HI>Mur∣murers, and Complainers?</HI> Who <HI>despise Do∣minion, and Speak evil of Dignities; but un∣godly Men, that walk after their own Lusts?</HI> Who are Quarrelsome, and Contentious? Who are Tale-bearers, Back-biters, and Slan∣derers? Whose <HI>Tongues set on fire the whole Course of Nature, and are set on fire of Hell?</HI> Who are Busie-bodies in other Mens Con∣cerns; and idle Drones in their own? Who are false, treacherous, and deceitful? Who would Sacrifice the good of the Public, to some private Lust? Who Spend their Time, consume their Estates, deprave their Minds, enfeeble their Bodies, &amp; dig their own Graves; by Loudness, Excess, and Intemperance? <HI>Who will mourn at the last, when their Flesh and their Bodies are consumed, saying how have we hated Instruction, and our Hearts de∣spised

<P>To say nothing here, of the moral Conse∣quence of Vice, and Wickedness; tho' it is certain that <HI>in the End they will bite like a Serpent, and sting like an Adder; and because of these things cometh the Wrath of God, upon the Children of Disobedience;</HI> and often too upon Kingdoms, States, and Communities; so <HI>that God is Known by the Judgments, that he executeth.</HI> But I say without bringing this into the Reckoning; every Vice in a political View, injures the Public; for it is so far from being true, (as has been pretended<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fable of the Bees.</HI></NOTE>) <HI>that private Vices, are public Benefits;</HI> that it will remain an unchangeable Truth, that <HI>Righte∣ousness exalteth a Nation,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sin is a Reproach unto any People,</HI> and tends to the Destruction of both Rulers, and Subjects. For when a Storm of Vice, and Wickedness, (ascending from the Mouth of the bottomless Pit,) breaks in upon a People, so as to shake the very Pillars of Government, and move the Foundations of the State, if the Body of the People have no Religion, and the Magistrate is unconcerned whether they have any or no; what can he do to save a tottering, or falling

State? He may punish some Vices it is true, and be hated and reviled for his Pains, until there will be a literal Fulfilment of that Pro∣phesie, <HI>they shall fret themselves, and Curse their King, and their God, and look upward; and they shall look unto the Earth, and behold Trouble and Darkness, Dimness of Angu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and they shall be driven to Darkness.</HI> In a word, Religion is like <HI>an Ax laid at the Root of the Tree;</HI> but all other Means without it, will do but little more than lop off some of the luxuriant Branches; and be but a small Check, to its Growth, and Fruitfulness. I therefore add,</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> When civil Rulers are influenced by the Grace of GOD, to do their Duty, they will sincerely Endeavour to promote Religion, as there is such a necessary Connexion, between this, and the good of Society. The Grace of GOD is <HI>that Wisdom that is from above, which is first pure, and then peaceable gentle, easie to be intreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, without Partiality, and without Hypocrisy.</HI> It is absolutely necessary, to make Men really good, in every Business, and in every Relation of Life. It will make Men good Masters, good Parents, good Neighbours, good Mi∣nisters, good Magistrates, and good Subjects. It has a mighty transforming Efficacy; It will turn Rebels, and Traitors, into loyal and
<PB N="22" REF="007407_0025_102BAE3DA9389108"/>
obedient Subjects: fierce and cruel Savages, into kind Benefactors: and Tyrants, Persecu∣tors, and Oppressors, into <HI>nursing Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>The Grace of GOD will refine the Minds, and enlarge the Hearts, of Men in Power. It will raise them above any low, selfish, mer∣cenary Views; and give them more exalted and sublime Sentiments; so as to consider themselves as <HI>God's Ministers,</HI> vested with his Authority, and acting for Him, and their greatest Concern will be, <HI>not to lade them∣selves with thick Clay;</HI> nor to gain the vain Applauses of Men, (whose Tongues are ven∣dible, and whose Affections are as mutable as the Wind) but the Approbation of GOD, whom they consider as their Witness, and Judge, <HI>their Shield, and exceeding great Re∣ward.</HI></P>
<P>Their Aims, and Views will not be confi∣ned to this little Spot of Earth; or within the Compass of a few Moments of Time; but their Prospect will extend to the Enjoy∣ments of a boundless Duration.</P>
<P>It will fill them with a tender Affection, and sincere Concern for all Mankind; but more especially for the People that they are so nearly related to, and will give them a fellow Feeling, and Sympathy with the rest of the Body, both in Prosperity and Adver∣sity.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="007407_0026_102BAE3FDE278F08"/>
It will enliven their Zeal, animate their Courage, and quicken their Activity, to pro∣mote the public good: And as they know by Experience the Necessity of Religion, to make Men good Members of Society, they will exert themselves to promote it.</P>
<P>But then the great Question is, Since Re∣ligion is not the direct Object of the Concern of the civil Magistrate in his political Capa∣city, what may he, or what ought he to do to promote it?</P>
<P>A full Discussion of this important Questi∣on, would take more Time than this Occasion will allow: And besides I am not so sanguine, as to imagine, that I can draw the Line with such Clearness, and Exactness that the contending Parties will abide by it, as the true Boundary. But however, I shall venture to suggest a few things, which may perhaps, give some Light, in the Case. And accordingly I would Observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. That no civil Magistrate has Authority to punish Men, for their religious Principles, or Practices, provided they don't disturb the civil Peace. The Right that all Men have as moral Agents, and accountable Creatures, to think, and act for themselves in those things that relate to their own eternal Salva∣tion, is now much better understood, and more freely acknowledged, than formerly,
<PB N="24" REF="007407_0027_102BAE420AA54010"/>
when Bigotry was too often Substituted, in the Room of that Zeal, which Springs from the Love of GOD, and our Neighbour. It is now generally acknowledged by Protestants, of every Denomination, that all Persecution merely upon the Account of Religion, is an unmerciful Violation, of the Law of Nature, and of the <HI>Law of Christ.</HI> And as there are eternal Rewards, or Punishments annexed to our Belief, and Practice; that civil Magistrate, who would compel Men to comply with his religious Sentiments, should give them good Security, that if they are misled, he will suf∣fer for them a vicarious Punishment, in the <HI>World to come,</HI> and that they shall be guiltless. For if we must believe by Proxy, what Rea∣son can be given why we should not be rewarded, or punished by Proxy? If the Ma∣gistrate had a just Claim to Infallibility, he aught have something more to say, <HI>for afflic∣ting Mens Bodies for the good of their Souls.</HI></P>
<P>But as we are (at best) but in a very imperfect State, while we <HI>dwell in Houses of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay,</HI> the Condition of our Nature might teach us Humility, and mutual Forbearance, rather than to assume to ourselves (what the Apostles utterly disclaimed) <HI>a Dominion over Mens Faith.</HI> Mens Minds ben't all cast in the same Mould; but they have different Capacities, different Tempers, and different
<PB N="25" REF="007407_0028_102BAE4512BD4978"/>
Advantages, of Education, Reading, and Conversation; and therefore different Prin∣ciples: And all the Severities that can be inflicted upon Mens Bodies, will in no wise enlighten their Minds, and change their Hearts: The utmost that can be done there∣fore in this way is to bring Men to a Con∣formity in Hypocrisy. But besides if one Magistrate has a Right to punish Men for their Heterodoxy, another who sustains the same Office, has as much Right to use the same Power, and upon this Foot, all the Persecutions that have ever been in the World, may be justified.</P>
<P>Among the Jews Idolaters were to be put to Death, it is true; but then they were a Theocracy, and Idolatry so far as it was re∣ceived, so far it destroyed their Polity, civil, as well as religious. But now as there is not the same Reason, there can't be the same Law.</P>
<P>The christian Religion never was promo∣ted by persecuting others. The Church may be made <HI>Drunk</HI> (as the Scripture expresses it) but will never thrive, by being fed with the Blood of human Sacrifices; instead of the <HI>sincere Milk of the Word.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the <HI>Meekness and Gentleness of Christ,</HI> that he never forced any Man to re∣ceive his Religion, thô he could have em∣ployed, <HI>more than twelve Legions of Angels
<PB N="26" REF="007407_0029_102BAE4712BF7FE0"/>
to compel Men to come in,</HI> if this method had been agreeable to the Nature and Design of it: But instead of this; when his Disciples discovered a persecuting Temper, towards Men who <HI>Worshipped they knew not what;</HI> He severely reproved them; <HI>Ye know not (says He) what manner of Spirit ye are of.</HI></P>
<P>And the Apostles when they went forth to propagate the Gospel, (being then fully ac∣quainted with the Nature, and Design of it) assured their Hearers, <HI>that the Weapons of their Warfare were not Carnal,</HI> but Spiritual; and that if <HI>the Mighty Works</HI> that were wrought by them, and <HI>the Preaching of the Gospel with Demonstration, and Power,</HI> were not sufficient to convert them, they would leave them to the Delusions of <HI>a reprobate Mind.</HI> But if their Hearers had known at the same Time, that when once the Rulers of the World would joyn with them; it was their real Design; and agreable to their true Principles, to convert Men with Fire, and Sword, Bonds and Imprisonments; I guess, they would hardly have thought, they were <HI>as harmless as Doves;</HI> how much so ever they might have, of <HI>the Wisdom of the Serpent:</HI> Neither would they have thought, they deserved the Character our Saviour gave them, when he said▪ <HI>behold I send you forth, as Lambs among Wolves.</HI> But I add,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="27" REF="007407_0030_102BAE48A49A1A18"/>
2. The civil Magistrate has no Right to make any Alterations, either in the Doctrins, Discipline, or Ordinances of Religion; for the sake of promoting the good of the State, or for any other Pretence whatsoever. The christian Religion in its native Purity, and Simplicity, has not been at all agreeable to the Gust of, curious Projectors: And hence Work enough has been found for the fruit∣ful Inventions of Men, that they might mix some Ingredients to make it more palatable; either from a Pretence of Order, Unity, and Decency; or to accommodate it to the Temper of the People; or to promote the Schemes of Politicians. King JAMES the first from political Views, had a great Fondness for the episcopal Form of Church Govern∣ment. It was his darling Maxim, no Bishop, no King. But another (who was so far from being a Puny in Politicks, that he placed himself at the Head of three Kingdoms, and caused himself to be worshipped, not only a∣mong, but even by the Gods of the Earth) had a very different View, he thought it was absurd, and dangerous to set up Imperium in Imperio; a Form of Government in the Church, to rival that of the State. But I imagine they were both very wrong, in ma∣king Religion the Creature of the State, when it ought to have be'n the Pillar, and Founda∣tion
<PB N="28" REF="007407_0031_102BAE4B36FB5528"/>
of it. For the christian Religion does not depend upon the capricious Fancies of States men; or the Refinements of Politi∣cians; (for if so, it would be as fluctuating as the Waves of the Sea) but it is, what it is, a glorious Scheme of Salvation, contrived, and instituted by infinite Wisdom, in all the Parts of it; to promote the Glory of its di∣vine Author, and the present Peace, and everlasting Happiness of Men.</P>
<P>There is a resplendent Glory, that Shines round the christian Religion; so that it is <HI>all glorious</HI> without; as well as <HI>all glorious within.</HI> The Angels behold it with humble Admira∣tion, tho' men, ungrateful Men treat it as an old fashioned thing <HI>without Form, and Com∣liness.</HI> But as counterfeit Colours, how art∣fully soever laid on, would tarnish, and de∣face an exquisite natural Beauty; so all the Ornaments, and Decorations that have be'n, or can be contrived, to make Christ's Institu∣tions more decent, and fashionable; serve to no other Purpose, but to hide their true Beau∣ty, and Glory; and to show the Presumption, and distempered Imaginations of the Authors and Contrivers of them. And indeed, it would be a bold Invasion of Christ's Kingly Office, and a daring Impeachment of his Wisdom, to pretend to make any Amend∣ments in his Ordinances, let the Pretence be
<PB N="29" REF="007407_0032_102BAE4DC8590238"/>
ever so Specious. In these things then, <HI>we must call no Man Master on Earth, for one is our Master, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and we must stand fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, and not be entangled with the Yoke of Bondage.</HI> When we do <HI>whatsoever Christ hath commanded,</HI> we are in a state of Liberty; but when we are <HI>so beguiled</HI> as to Submit our Necks to the Yoke of human Impositions, in the Worship of GOD, as our Worship will be so far a vain Worship; so we shall oe in <HI>Bon∣dage to Men,</HI> who may without End, make one indifferent Thing Necessary, as well as another. The same transubstantiating Power, that can change the Nature of one indifferent thing can another, until all the Fopperies of the Church of Rome, will become necessary Gospel Ordinances. In a Word then, what∣soever Christ has required of us, either by the Law of Nature, or by his Written Word, ought to be a Part of our Religion; <HI>but whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil;</HI> and therefore indifferent things ought to re∣main as they are, without any Stamp of hu∣man Authority to give them a Currency. This is (I think) the only firm Foundation, on which the Peace, and Purity of the Church can be Built.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Magistrate has no Right by Virtue of his Office, to intermeddle with the Disci∣pline
<PB N="30" REF="007407_0033_102BAE4F4A56B2B0"/>
of the Church. As Christ is the only King in his Church, He has appointed a dif∣ferent Order of Men to be Officers therein: And he has committed unto them the <HI>Key</HI> of Discipline, as well as the <HI>Key</HI> of Doctrine. All therefore that would <HI>live Godly in Christ Jesus,</HI> are required <HI>to obey them who have the Rule over them, and submit themselves▪ for they watch for their Souls as they that must give Account.</HI> CHRIST's Kingdom is not a Worldly, but a Spiritual Kingdom, set up in the Hearts, and Consciences of Men; and all his true Subjects are <HI>a willing People:</HI> And no external Force, or Violence is to be used with Men to keep them within the Church, any more than to bring them in. But when Discipline (which is a Spiritual Thing,) has been used with such as are guilty of Heresy, or Scandal, for their spiritual Good, and the Good of others; <HI>for Edification, and not for Destruction;</HI> if after all, <HI>the unbelieving depart, let them depart, &amp; remain as Heathen Men and Publicans.</HI> If they should be brôt to a Submission, by Fines, and Imprison∣ments, it would be an Argument of their Hypocrisy; but not of their <HI>Repentance to∣wards God, &amp; Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> and therefore such a forced Submissi∣on, would in no wife qualify them for Com∣munion with the Church of CHRIST. But
<PB N="31" REF="007407_0034_102BAE5167A3CFD8"/>
these things being premised, I proceed to say; that there are many things notwithstanding, that ought to be done by civil Rulers by Virtue of their Office, to promote Religion.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">(1) They ought to publickly own and Sup∣port the christian Religion, in such a Way as they think, (according to the best Light they can get from the Word of GOD) to be most agreable to the Mind, and Will of the great Governor of the World; and therefore would best answer the Ends of Government. There is a great Difference between a Tole∣ration, and an Establishment. Every Religion that don't disturb the civil Peace ought to be tolerated, but not established, and supported at the public Charge. But as the christian Religion ought to be owned, and professed by all Men, so it should be established and supported by public Authority. The glory of GOD, and the good of Society, as well as the eternal Salvation of the Souls of Men; make it evident that such a pure and merciful Religion, which was published by the Son of GOD, ought to be publickly received with due Deference, and Respect; and not be put upon a Level with mere Heathenism. But if civil Rulers have nothing to do to provide for the Support of Religion, but every Man must be allowed to act in this Case, as his
<PB N="32" REF="007407_0035_102BAE53E7A8FFF8"/>
own Prejudice, or Avarice may incline him; what can they do by virtue of their Office, to shew their Respect to the Christian Reli∣gion more than to mere Heathenism? And how can Rulers answer the Character that is given of Christian Magistrates, in the Word of GOD; if they are not to provide for the Support of Religion? Don't we read, <HI>that kings should be Nursing Fathers, and Queens should be Nursing Mothers,</HI> to the Church, and People of GOD, under the Gospel Dis∣pensation?</P>
<P>But then, the religious Establishment ought to be founded upon such a broad Bottom, and understood in such a Latitude, that all good Christians notwithstanding their different Sentiments, may receive Benefit by it. Men may be sincere Christians, and therefore very useful Members of the political Body; tho' they may be mistaken with Respect to some circumstantial things in Religion: They may <HI>build Wood, Hay, and Stubble,</HI> (as the Apostle expresses it) upon the true Foundation. In this Case the Law of Charity, (which is in a peculiar Man∣ner the <HI>Law of Christ</HI>) requires us <HI>to bear one anothers Burdens, and receive one a∣nother, as Christ also receives us.</HI> Uniformity in all the Externals of Religion, would be ve∣ry desirable, if we could all think alike; but
<PB N="33" REF="007407_0036_102BAE556AADA4D8"/>
as this is not to be expected in this present State of Imperfection; a Law of Comprehen∣sion, would be much more agreable to the De∣sign of the christian Religion, (which is to unite Men to Christ by Faith, and to one another by Charity) than a Law of strict Uniformity, whereby Men must be obliged to act alike, whatever their Thoughts are. And therefore as the Terms of Christianity, and Nothing else, ought to be the Terms of Communion in the Church of Christ; so the Religion of CHRIST, and Nothing else, ought to be established under the Notion of Religion in a christian State. And as all christian Churches have a Right to Judge for themselves, what are the Terms of Christianity, and therefore what Qualifications are necessary in their own Members; so the Legislature of every chri∣stian State, have a right to judge what is the Religion of CHRIST, and what Principles, and Practises may justly exclude Men from the Privileges of a religious Establishment. For if every Man ought to have the Liberty of private Judgment, then every Community ought to have the Liberty of public Judg∣ment: The Legislature ought to have as much Liberty of Conscience to think for themselves, what will be for the public good, as every Man ought to have; that he may think for himself what will be for his own
<PB N="34" REF="007407_0037_102BAE56F9967650"/>
good. And therefore it will follow, that if the Legislature must be obliged to receive Men as Christians, (who profess a Religion that tends to the best good of the State) when they believe in their Conscience, that their professed Principles, and Practises, are incon∣sistant with Christianity, and so with the good of the State; they have no Liberty of Con∣science: And upon the same Supposition, there could be no Discipline in the Church, nor any Religion at all established, and sup∣ported in the State; but every Man must be left to his own Fancy, or Humour, and be intitled to equal Authority, and equal Privi∣leges with others, let him be an Atheist, or a Deist, a Papist, or an Heathen, any Thing, or Nothing. And indeed upon this Suppo∣sition, there could be no such thing as a chri∣stian State, unless there may be a Christian State, that do'n't (as such,) profess the christian Religion. But upon the whole, as the religious Establishment, ought to be found∣ed upon charitable Principles, otherwise it would not be Suited to the Temper of the Gospel; so they who don't think fit to com∣ply with it, ought <HI>to lead a quiet, and peace∣able Life,</HI> and be contented with a Toleration. And they not think it hard, if they are obliged to bear a Part in the public Charges, that are thought necessary by the proper
<PB N="35" REF="007407_0038_102BAE598270D8F0"/>
Judges to promote the good of the Public; <HI>for in the Peace thereof, they themselves shall have Peace.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) They who are in Authority, ought to take care of the public Worship of GOD, and oblige all that are under their Government, to steadily, and orderly attend upon his public Worship, in some way, and manner agreable to their Profession; when they have the Ad∣vantage, and Opportunity for it. It is absurd, to speak of allowing Atheists Liberty of Con∣science. Because he who professeth himself to be an Atheist, at the same Time professes that he has no Conscience. For what Con∣science can a Man have; who believes there is no GOD, no moral Obligations, no future Rewards, and Punishments? But whatever Men Profess with their Mouths, their refusing to worship GOD in Public, is a practical Pro∣fession of Atheism. For altho' there have been some, who have so far sunk into Brutality as to deny the Being, and Perfections of GOD; Yet there never were any that did believe the Being of a GOD, of infinite Perfections, and at the same Time believe that he ought not to be Worshipped. And as GOD hath appointed one Day in Seven, for his more immediate Worship, and Service, due care should be taken by civil Rulers, that the Christian Sab∣bath be not Prophaned. Experience shews,
<PB N="36" REF="007407_0039_102BAE5B85680498"/>
that a due Sanctification of the Lord's-Day, has a mighty Influence upon the Manners of the People; and that all practical Religion, will stand, or fall according as it is observed.</P>
<P>I add,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Every Word, and every Action, that in an open &amp; profane Manner, discovers a Con∣tempt of GOD, and Religion, is an Iniquity that ought to be <HI>punished by the Judge.</HI> Not only vile Swearers, <HI>who set their Mouth against the Heavens;</HI> and prophane Despisers of GOD, who in a way of Defiance, call upon their Maker, to exert his Almighty Power in the Damnation of themselves, and others; but even Scoffers, who make a mock of Sacred Things, ought to be treated as Enemies to GOD, and human Society. Religion is a very serious Thing, and it would be very unchristian, as well as uncivil, to Mock and Deride Men for their religious Princi∣ples, and Practises, supposing them to be wrong: instead of this, we ought to pity them, and pray for them, and use proper Methods to convince them of their Mis∣takes. But as the christian Religion will certainly stand its Ground, if it may have a fair Trial at the Bar of Reason, and is pub∣lickly owned as the Religion of the State; no Man ought to be allowed with Impunity to treat it in a flouting, and scoffing Manner.
<PB N="37" REF="007407_0040_102BAE5D87AB8BF8"/>
And the like may be said with respect to the Rule of our Faith, the Holy Scriptures; and the Ordinances of Religion; which are some∣times treated with such <HI>railing Accusations, as Michael the Archangel would not bring against the Devil himself.</HI> This Method has be'n the principal Engine that has be'n made use of, to batter down the Bulwarks of our Faith, and to propagate Infidelity. Thô I hope this has not been so common among us, as in some other Places; but if the Floodgates should be set open, or the Banks should be removed, what can we expect, but to be de∣luged with a Flood of Impiety? And,</P>
<P N="4">(4.) Civil Rulers should use all proper Endeavours to strengthen the Hands, and encourage the Hearts, of the Ministers of Religion. Thus <HI>King Hezekiah, spake com∣fortably to all the Levites, that taught the good Knowlege of the Lord.</HI> The magisterial, and ministerial Authority, are very different, in their Nature, and Kind; but yet instead of rivaling one another, when they are duly im∣proved, they will be very helpful; and sub∣servient each to the other. <HI>Thus God led his People like a Flock, by the Hand of Moses, and Aaron.</HI> The civil, and ecclesiastical Autho∣rity, were united in promoting the good of that People. If Ministers are faithful, and successful, they will be greatly Instrumental
<PB N="38" REF="007407_0041_102BAE5FCFB73D38"/>
to preserve the Peace of the State, and to promote the Honour, and Obedience which the People owe to their Rulers. For the more real Success they have in their Work, the more Conscientious People will be, to discharge every Duty, in every Relation of Life, <HI>that they may render to all their Dues: Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Custom to whom Custom; Fear to whom Fear; Honour to whom Honour.</HI> And therefore good Po∣licy, as well as the express Command, and Or∣dination of Christ, requires that they should be Encouraged, and Supported.</P>
<P><HI>I trust we are not seeking great things for ourselves: We are not in the Pursuit of Riches, nor worldly Promotions. We don't want the Assistance of the secular Arm, that we may lord it over God's Heritage; Nor do we desire to make the civil Magistrate, the Instrument of our religious Vengeance, to oblige Men to sub∣mit to our Dictates. No; all that we desire is, that we may be considered, (as we always have be'n) upon the Account of our Office, as useful, and necessary Members of the Commu∣nity; and that as such, we may be enabled to lead a quiet and a peaceable Life, not in Pomp, and Luxury, but in the humble and decent Exercise of our Ministry, which calls for all our Time and Talents.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="39" REF="007407_0042_102BAE6221E696C0"/>
(5.) Civil Rulers ought to provide, Sup∣port, and regulate the proper Means of Edu∣cation; that there may be a Succession of well qualified Men in the Sacred Ministry. Schools, and Colleges for the Education of Youth, are necessary that Men may be fitted for public Offices in the State; (as I observed) but they are more especially necessary that Men may be fitted for the Service of the Sanctuary. We that are now on the Stage of Action are going off; <HI>and must not continue by Reason of Death: The Eyes of them who now see us, in a little Time must see us no more.</HI> And it would give us a very gloomy Pros∣pect, if we had Reason to think, that when our heads are laid, our People will be led, (as one expressed it,) by dark Lanthorns, or erratic Fires.</P>
<P>There are some (we know,) who despise Learning, and speak of Colleges with the ut∣most Contempt. But if Ignorance be such a precious thing, as to be the Mother of De∣votion in the Church of Rome; yet it is not the most necessary Qualification in a Gospel Minister; who according to the Direction of the Apostle, <HI>must give himself to Reading, that he may be apt to teach; able to instruct others; and able to resist Gainsayers.</HI></P>
<P>It was Jeroboam's Sin, <HI>that he made Priests of the meanest of the People.</HI> And Julian the
<PB N="40" REF="007407_0043_102BAE656E39E0A8"/>
Apostate; that he might destroy Christianity, endeavoured to Suppress Learning among the Christians, as much as lay in his Power.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Socrat. Hist. ecclesiast. Lib. 2. Cap. 13.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>But as Learning is not the only necessary Qualification for the Gospel Ministry, there∣fore Colleges, and Schools of Learning should be kept under, such religious Re∣gulations, that they may be Nursuries of Ver∣tue, and true Religion. For if these Foun∣tains are poisoned with Error, or corrupted with Vice, what can we expect of the Streams that are to water the Sanctuary?</P>
<P N="6">(6.) Civil Rulers of the highest Rank, ought to imploy Men that are friendly to Re∣ligion, in subordinate Places of Power, and Trust. Men of corrupt Principles, subver∣sive of the Religion of the State; or that are irreligious in their Behaviour, are unfit to be imployed in Places of Power, and Trust. Men who have no Self-Government, should not be set to govern others. David's Con∣duct in this Case, was agreable to the Cha∣racter of a good Politician, as well as of a good Man <HI>Mine Eyes,</HI> says he, <HI>shall be upon the Faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way, he shall serve me.</HI> And the Advice that Jethro gave Moses, made his <HI>Name</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="007407_0044_102BAE6791922758"/>
<HI>to become better than precious Ointment: Thou shalt Provide,</HI> says he, <HI>out of all the People, able Men, such as fear GOD, Men of Truth, hating Covetousness, and place such over them.</HI> I shall add but once more,</P>
<P N="7">(7.) Civil Rulers should endeavour to pro∣mote Religion by an unblemished, exemplary Conversation. Examples operate in a Way that is hard to describe, but yet they have a very powerful Influence upon others, and especially the Examples of Men of high Rank and Dignity. If the Sins of Rulers <HI>go before hand to Judgment;</HI> if they shew a Contempt of GOD, and Religion, and live in the Indul∣gence of fleshly Lusts; their Examples will <HI>be a Destruction that will wast at Noon-Day;</HI> and they themselves instead of being Lights in the World, will be no better than an Ignis fatuus, a false Blaze, to bewilder others in the Darkness of the Night; until they go out <HI>in utter Darkness,</HI> and their deluded Followers <HI>stumble upon the dark Mountains.</HI> But on the other Hand, when they become bright Examples of undissembled Piety, and of all that is truly great, &amp; good; they will appear <HI>as burning and shining Lights, to revive, and cherish Religion in others. And as their Lights thus shine before Men, others seeing their good Works, will glorify their Heavenly Father.</HI></P>

But I proceed to make some Improve∣ment of my Subject. And,</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> We may learn from what has be'n ob∣served, that it ought to be the great Care, and Concern of them who are in Authority in this Community; to suppress, or remove every thing that is hurtful to Religion among us. That there are many abounding Iniquities a∣mong us, we can't but be Sensible, notwith∣standing the many Means that have be'n used to promote a Reformation. Good Laws have be'n enacted, Days of Fasting, and Humiliation, have be'n observed, and these things have be'n testified against by them who are set as <HI>Watchmen,</HI> and required to <HI>cry a∣loud, and lift up their Voice like a Trumpet.</HI> And what has been the Event? Are we now a reformed People? A People devoted to the Service of GOD? No; <HI>but our Trans∣gressions are multiplied, and our Iniquities testi∣fy against us,</HI> and forebode the severe Rebukes of a Sin-revenging GOD. <HI>We may look for Salvation;</HI> but what Reason have we to ex∣pect, <HI>but that it will be far from us,</HI> unless our <HI>Repentance</HI> prevent <HI>our Ruin?</HI> And is there nothing further to be done by our Ru∣lers, and Guides in this deplorable Case? Must they now come to that sad Conclusion; <HI>let him that is unjust be unjust still; and let him that is filthy be filthy still?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="007407_0046_102BAE6BA8647FF8"/>
But notwithstanding there are so many GOD-provoking Sins to be found in our Skirts; I don't Suspect that we <HI>are Sinners above all Men that dwell in New England;</HI> unless it be in one Instance, and how that is <HI>God knows.</HI> But I greatly fear, (I tremble to Speak it!) I greatly fear, that the Sin of false Swearing, is more common among us than many People imagine. An enormous Crime! The Weight of a Mountain of Lead, would be no more than a Feather, in Com∣parison of that Load of Guilt that lies upon the Souls of such Men, as do in the most explicit Manner, renounce the Mercy, and imprecate the Vengeance of that Almighty Being <HI>to whom Vengeance belongs!</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>The very Heathen by the Light of Nature, were taught the Religion of an Oath; and look'd upon Perjury as a Sin of the deepest Dye. Machiavel in one of his Discourses upon the first Decad of Livy; says <Q>that whoever will peruse the extraordinary Actions of the City of Rome collectively; or of several Romans in particular; will find that they were more tender of falsi∣fying an Oath, than of violating the Laws; judging an Offence against God, more hainous than an Offence against Men; and God more able to punish it.</Q> And to the same Purpose Cicero, <Q>Our Ancestors (says he) could never find out any thing stronger than an Oath, to bind us to the faithful Discharge of what we had engaged.</Q> Diodorus Siculus (Lib. 1. c. 77) relates of the Egyptians; that by their Laws, <Q>Persons that had forsworn themselves, were Adjudged to capital Punishments, as guilty of the two greatest Crimes, in violating that Piety they owed to God, and destroying Faith from amongst Men, the strongest Pillar of human Society.</Q> See a Pamphlet entituled the Nature and Importance of Oaths and Juries.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="007407_0047_102BAE6EC0CD1BD0"/>
But tho' I charitably believe, there are but few that would dare to call the great and e∣verliving GOD to witness, to the truth of what they know to be false: These are abandoned Sinners, <HI>whose Consciences are seared as with an hot Iron:</HI> Yet have we not Reason to fear, that there are too many, that bring themselves under the Obligations of a promissary Oath; who but little consider, that <HI>God will not be mocked?</HI> But as Sermons upon these Occasi∣ons, are not designed for mere Parade, and Show; I would with Suitable Deference to the Legislature, humbly propose it to their
<PB N="45" REF="007407_0048_102BAE70434D0050"/>
Consideration; whether some petty Offices might not be discharged as well without the solemnity of an Oath? Or whether the levying a Fine, upon such as are Unfaithful might not be as effectual to secure their Fidelity? An Oath is a very solemn thing, and ought not to be trifled with, and there is infinite Danger in these Cases, that too great Familiarity may breed Contempt.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nothing has raised the Character of the pre∣sent King of Prussia more among foreign Nati∣ons, or rendr'd him more a Father to his Peo∣ple; than the Reformation that he has made, in the Laws of his Country, and in the Courts of Justice. I shall transcribe one Passage out of a Letter from Berlin, (dated March 11th, 1755,) which is to my Purpose. The King has provided,</HI> <Q>that the Sacredness of Oaths, which the Law admits only as an extreme Remedy, to come at the Truth, do not degenerate into a public Abuse; by too lightly multiplying Oaths, the criminal Custom of which, brings the Wrath of God upon States.</Q> <HI>The Pub∣lisher of this Letter remarks satyrically enough,</HI> <Q>that his Countrymen (the English) need not take notice of any thing said in it; no not e∣ven of the Abuse of Oaths; since some Folks are so wise, as to think the Revenue cannot be collected without that dangerous Expedient.</Q> See <HI>N. York Gazette,</HI> N. 644▪</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="007407_0049_102BAE71C617FF60"/>
And I would beg Leave to propose further, whether in the Oath commonly call'd the Free∣mans Oath, sufficient Allowance is made for the Weakness, and Infirmities of Human Na∣ture; in some of the Expressions of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Judges (it is true,) are as much bound by their Oath, not to shew Favour to any Man in the Execution of their Office; as the Freemen are in giving their Vote. But then it may be considered,</HI> 1st, <HI>That the mobile Vul∣gus, the unthinking Part of Mankind, are no more fit to take the Judges Oath, than to exe∣cute the Office.</HI> 2dly, <HI>The Law makes allow∣ance for the Infirmities of human Nature, in the Case of Judges, and discharges them from setting in Judgment, when they are under visi∣ble Temptations to break their Oath. But in this Case a man may Vote for himself, or his nearest Relations. And</HI> 3rdly, <HI>Severe Penal∣ties ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> provided by the Law to Guard the Oath of Judges that it may not be violated. And our History will furnish us, with a Num∣ber of Instances of Judges, who have be'n se∣verely punished, for not executing their Office according to their Oath. But in this Case Men may give their Vote for the greatest Knaves in the Country, and for the most dan∣gerous Enemies to the State, without any Fear of Punishment from Men.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="007407_0050_102BAE74480C4D80"/>
I make no Question, but that Oaths may be necessary in some Cases to secure the Go∣vernment; thô Experience shews, they are not so great a Security as might be reasona∣bly expected. Trajan the roman Emperor was very sensible of this; and being conscious of his own good Intentions; instead of taking an Oath, as usual of the Captain of the Preto∣rian Guards; when he delivered the Sword to him; he said, <HI>Draw this for me if I deserve it, otherwise draw it against me.</HI></P>
<P>But thô they are necessary, in some Cases, (as I observed;) yet (it appears to me,) they ought to be so expressed that every ho∣nest Man that is a Friend to the Government, may take them without any Scruple of Con∣science; and that every honest Man that does take them, may freely act upon them, with∣out having any Uneasiness in his Mind after∣wards. As in the Marriage Covenant, it is thought sufficient for the Man to Swear, that he will be a loving, and a faithful Husband; but if he should proceed further, and Swear that he would never treat his Wise with any Unkindness, in any one Instance, notwith∣standing any Temptations, or Provocations that he might meet with; it would be a very unadvised Oath. How far this is applicable in the present Case, I shall leave to the Judg∣ment of my Superiors: But with Submission,
<PB N="48" REF="007407_0051_102BAE7656E47940"/>
I would make this Remark; if it be found upon due Inquiry, that there are some Ex∣pressions, that are too strong for the present state of Weakness, and Depravity that we are in; and so become an Occasion of laying wast Mens Consciences, they ought no Doubt to be altered. A Medicine may be very good, and very proper to cure a Disease; but yet if the State of the Patient be'nt duly considered, it may prove present Death; instead of a Re∣lief. I know that our worthy Ancestors had a good End, in forming the Oath as it now stands: And Moses had a good End too, in making the brazen Serpent, he did it by the divine Command, and it was the Medium by which GOD dispensed a miraculous Mercy to his People; and it was moreover; A spe∣cial Type of the great Redeemer of the World; and yet when it became the Occa∣sion of the Peoples Sinning against GOD, the good <HI>King Hezekiah break it in Pieces, and called it Nehushtan;</HI> i. e. A brazen thing by way of Contempt. And if Perjury is be∣come common among us, by the Occasion of this Oath, and the Legislature use no En∣deavours to prevent it; the Community as such, are involved in the Guilt of it, and may expect the heavy Judgments of GOD. This is a Sin that will <HI>cause the Land to mourn:</HI> for how can we expect but that GOD will <HI>curse</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="007407_0052_102BAE78DD086368"/>
<HI>our Blessings,</HI> if we don't endeavour to purge out such <HI>an accursed thing from our Tents?</HI> As there is a <HI>GOD that judgeth in the Earth,</HI> He will surely vindicate the Honour of his Name. We find Instances in Scripture of Public Judgments, that were inflicted upon a whole Nation upon the Account of this Sin. In the Days of David GOD sent <HI>a Famine three Years, year after Year,</HI> because under the Conduct of Saul, they had violated the Oath, that their Fathers made to the Gibeo∣nites, above two Hundred Years before. And afterwards by breaking the Oath, that their <HI>prophane Prince</HI> made in their Behalf to the King of Babylon, <HI>they filled up the Mea∣sure of their Iniquities, and their Land was left desolate.</HI></P>
<P>When this Sin becomes common among a People, and is connived at, it is in vain for them to expect that the LORD will be their GOD. <HI>Will ye</HI> (says GOD by the Mouth of his Prophet)—<HI>Swear falsely—and come and stand before me, in this House that is called by my Name!</HI></P>
<P>But I shall add but one Remark further upon this head, and that is, that if ever this Case required the Attention of the Legisla∣ture, without Doubt it does now; as there are so many Persons, that have their Minds so much ruffled, with Prejudice, and Passion,
<PB N="50" REF="007407_0053_102BAE7A95DF4228"/>
that they appear to be utterly uncapable to act with that Seriousness, and Solemnity that they ought to do, when they have given their Souls as a Pledge, to be disposed of by Him <HI>who judgeth righteously,</HI> according as they observe their Oath; and when they are in such amazing Danger, of <HI>treasuring up to themselves Wrath, against the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But, whether it be thought, that what I have Suggested, proceeds from a well regu∣lated Zeal, or from an over-heated Imagina∣tion; I have this to say, I have no worse Motive (that I know of;) than a compassio∣nate Concern for the Souls of Men, and an hearty Regard to the best good of the Com∣munity; and I pray GOD that all that are under the Obligations of this, or any other Oath, may duly consider, that <HI>the Judge stands before the Door;</HI> and that the Time is approaching, when GOD will certainly distin∣guish, <HI>between him that Sweareth, and him that feareth an Oath; and that he will not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name in Vain.</HI></P>
<P>But,</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> If civil Rulers in their political Capa∣city, ought to use their sincere Endeavours to promote Religion, we may then learn,
<PB N="51" REF="007407_0054_102BAE7C9FF59078"/>
what inviolable Obligations the Ministers of Religion, are under to devote themselves wholly to the Service of it. Religion ought to be the direct, and immediate Object of our Concern, <HI>as Ministers of CHRIST, and Stewards of the Mysteries of GOD.</HI> We are employed in this Work, that we may be the Means of enlarging the Redeemer's King∣dom, <HI>and of making ready a People prepared for the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>it pleases GOD by the Foolishness of Preaching, to Save them that believe; we must warn every Man, and teach every Man, in all Wisdom, that we may present every Man, Perfect in CHRIST JESUS.</HI> Our Work is great, and of vast Importance to the Souls of Men: <HI>To some we are a savour of Life, unto Life; and to others a savour of Death, unto Death; and who is sufficient for these things?</HI></P>
<P>May GOD give us a due Sense of the Im∣portance of our Work, the Worth of preci∣ous and immortal Souls, and the great ac∣count that we must give of our Stewardship.</P>
<P>And may we have Grace, <HI>that we may be found faithful, that the Blessings of Souls ready to perish may come upon us; and when the chief Shepherd shall appear, may we re∣ceive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="007407_0055_102B874715768990"/>
<HI>III.</HI> From what we have heard, we may learn that as good Rulers are a great Bles∣sing, we ought to be thankful to GOD for them, discharge the Duties, we owe to them, and suitably improve the Advantages we en∣joy under them. Good Rulers are decy∣phered in the divine Oracles, by such signi∣ficant Expressions, as convey a very grand, and sublime Idea, of their great Usefulness. They are called <HI>Lights</HI> to comfort, and di∣rect the political Body; <HI>Shields</HI> to protect, and defend it; <HI>Nursing Fathers</HI> to provide for it; and the very <HI>Breath of our Nostrils,</HI> to preserve its Life, and Vigour. And the very Light of Nature, as well as the Word of GOD, makes it evident, that there are cor∣respondent Duties, that Subjects owe to their Rulers. Instead of being <HI>Murmurers and Complainers;</HI> Instead of <HI>reviling the Gods, and speaking evil of the Rulers of our People;</HI> Instead of listening to the groundless Sur∣mises, <HI>and evil Reports</HI> of designing Men; instead of being fickle, and given to Change, like Weather-cocks, that turn with every Breath of Wind, until they wear themselves out, with their own Motion: (the Bane of popular States!) I say instead of these things, we ought with the most unfeigned Gratitude, to pay our Vows <HI>to the Father of Mercies;</HI> for the Provision that He has made for our
<PB N="53" REF="007407_0056_102BAE80A869BFB8"/>
Peace, and Safety, under them <HI>who naturally care for our State.</HI></P>
<P>We ought to Honour our Rulers, <HI>and esteem them very highly in Love, for their Works Sake.</HI> Support them honourably, ac∣cording to their Character, that neither their Persons, nor Office may be despised: Submit to their just and legal Authority: Defend their Persons, and good Names, against all the Assaults of Malice and Envy: And last∣ly fervently pray for them to the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> that they may be blessed with all the Blessings of his Grace, and Goodness, and that they may be to us, as <HI>the Light of the Morning when the Sun riseth, even a Morning without Clouds: As the tender Grass spring∣ing out of the Earth by clear Shining after Rain.</HI> And the best Improvement, we can make of the Advantages we enjoy under them is, <HI>to lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godliness, and Honesty.</HI></P>
<P>But to conclude; let us all endeavour to do <HI>the Work of the Day, while the Day lasts; and to serve our Generation</HI> in our various Stations, <HI>by the Will of GOD before we fall on Sleep.</HI></P>
<P>GOD has distinguished us above any other People, by the innumerable temporal, and spiritual Blessings, and Privileges that we
<PB N="54" REF="007407_0057_102BAE82AF136C10"/>
enjoy. Our Air is healthful to breathe in, and our Soil is sufficiently Fruitful, to libe∣rally reward the diligent Husbandman, and Supply us with all the Necessaries, and most of the Conveniences of Life. Our civil Pri∣vileges are so great, as to make us the Envy, (not to say of our Enemies,) but even of our Neighbours. Our Laws, are very well calculated to secure our Lives, and Proper∣ties, and to reward the good, and punish the bad. Our Rulers were born, and edu∣cated among our selves, and have no foreign Attachments, to counteract the Love of their Country; no Separate Interests to draw off their Attention from the good of the public. And indeed, we shall be guilty of inexcusa∣ble Ingratitude, if we don't freely acknow∣lege, that the Government has be'n served from Time, to Time, by Men of a public Spirit, and of great Wisdom, and Probity. So that instead of having the Bramble to rule over us, to scratch and tear us, (as in Jotham's Parable,) we have sat under the Shadow, of the spreading and fruitful Vine.</P>
<P>Our Ministers are learned, and orthodox, and have supported their Character, by their evangelical Preaching, and by the Regularity of their Lives; as well (to speak Modestly) as any such Number of Men of their Or∣der,
<PB N="55" REF="007407_0058_102BAE861A57B2B8"/>
in any Part of the World. So that our Zion, does not set Solitary, <HI>stretching forth her Hands</HI> and looking until her <HI>Eyes fail,</HI> for some to relieve her from beyond the Seas; <HI>for her own Sons stand ready to comfort her and take her by the Hand.</HI></P>
<P>Our religious Constitution is very good, if not in all Respects perfect; and is well fitted to preserve religious Liberty, Unity, and good Order amongst the Ministers, and Churches of Christ: And one of the peculiar Excellencies of it is, that Men may differ in Opinion about some circumstantial things in Religion, and yet be owned as united Bre∣thren.</P>
<P>We are watered with <HI>the Rains and Dews</HI> of GOD's Ordinances, administred according to their Original Institution; that in them we may <HI>see CHRIST, as though evidently set forth as Crucified before our Eyes.</HI> And GOD has very often appeared for us, in a very signal Manner in the Way of his Providence; <HI>and be'n as a Wall of Fire round about us.</HI></P>
<P>Surely we have Reason to say, on this Day of <HI>the Gladness of our Hearts, how precious are thy Thoughts unto us O God! How great is the Sum of them! when we count them over, they are more in Number than the Sand</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="007407_0059_102BAE879E4E06B0"/>
<HI>which is upon the Sea Shore, and when we awake we are still with thee. The Lines are fallen unto us in pleasant Places, and we have a goodly Heritage!</HI> O how happy should we be, if we did but know our own Hap∣piness! What can make us unhappy, if we don't make ourselves so? And now <HI>what shall we render to God for all his Benefits?</HI> Should not the <HI>Mercies of God</HI> excite us, <HI>to present not only our Bodies, but even our Souls as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable unto God?</HI> Can we content ourselves with a mere <HI>Form of Godliness, while we deny the Power of it?</HI> Can we satisfy ourselves one Moment, without <HI>a good hope thrô Grace</HI> that we have laid the Foundation of a reli∣gious Life, by a saying Conversion to GOD, in a way of Humiliation, and Faith in a glo∣rious Redeemer? <HI>And can we rejoice in this Hope, unless we have the Testimony of our own Conscience, that in Simplicity, and godly Sin∣cerity, not with fleshly Wisdom; but by the Grace of God, we have our Conversation in the World?</HI> We may value ourselves very much upon our Privileges, and upon our Profession; but we should consider, that it is a Truth that will remain more firm, and unshaken, than the Pillars of Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, or the Foundation of the Earth, <HI>that without Holi∣ness, no Man shall see the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="007407_0060_102BAE89A0D0E100"/>
We ought to be greatly concerned about the Sins of others, and even <HI>mourn in Se∣cret Places,</HI> that there are so many Land-defiling Sins, that break in upon us, like a Flood: And as <HI>GOD's Hand is now lifted up,</HI> and he is showing us <HI>the Rod of his Anger, our Flesh might well tremble for fear of GOD,</HI> and we might be <HI>afraid of his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>But however GOD may deal with us as a People, or as a Community, it infinitely con∣cerns every one of us in particular, <HI>to know the Plague of our own Hearts</HI> and to mourn over our own past Sins; and <HI>to fly for Re∣fuge, to lay hold on the Hope set before us.</HI> We are all hastening to that Place, <HI>from whence we shall never return,</HI> and we have something to do, of greater Importance, than to blow Feathers about in the Air. We may live in Jest, but we must die in earnest; and there is no trifling in Heaven, or Hell. There is an awful Seriousness, that may be observed in all the Parts of the visible Cre∣ation. Every thing (Man excepted,) tends to promote the great End for which it was made; and all things with one united Voice, call upon us to be serious, and <HI>work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</HI> Thrô the infinite Patience, and Long-suffer∣ing of GOD, we have yet <HI>an accepted Time,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="007407_0061_102BAE8BB90F3D20"/>
<HI>and a Day of Salvation,</HI> let it therefore <HI>suffice us,</HI> that we have spent so much of our Time, either in the vain Amusements, or criminal Indulgences of a sensual Life, and let us endeavour <HI>to press forward, towards the Mark for the Prize, of the high Calling of God in Christ Jesus: That we may finally receive the End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling; and to present you faultless, before the presence of his Glory, with exceeding Joy; to the only wise God our Saviour, be Glory, and Majesty, Dominion and Power; both now, and ever,</HI></P>
