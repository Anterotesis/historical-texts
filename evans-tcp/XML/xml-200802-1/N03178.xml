<HEAD>Every Man his own Doctor: OR, The Poor Planter's Physician.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE most acceptable Service we can render to GOD, is BENEFICENCE to <HI>Man.</HI> There are Three Ways of be∣nefitting our Fellow Creatures. We may be useful to their Souls, by good Instruction, and good Example. We may be helpful to their Bodies, by feed∣ing the Hungry, cloathing the Naked, and prescribing easy Remedies to the Sick: We can aid them in their Fortunes, by encou∣raging
<PB N="4" REF="003843_0003_10026338F27F17F0"/>
of Industry, by relieving the Dis∣trest, and doing all the kind Offices we are able, to our Neighbours. These are the several Ways of improving the Talents our Maker has entrusted us with; and we must every one expect, hereafter to give an Account, how we have employ'd them.</P>
<P>I WISH it were in my Power, to serve Mankind, more than I do, in each of these Particulars; but the gracious Ac∣ceptance of the Widow's Offering, encou∣rages me also to cast my MITE into the Treasury. I publish this short Treatise, to lead the Poorer Sort into the <HI>pleasant Paths of Health;</HI> and when they have the Mis∣fortune to be <HI>sick,</HI> to shew them the cheap∣est and easiest Ways of <HI>getting well</HI> again.</P>
<P>OUR Country is unhappily subject to several very sharp Distempers. The Mul∣titude of Marshes, Swamps, and great Wa∣ters, send forth so many Fogs, and Exha∣lations, that the Air is continually damp with them: This, in Spight of our Precau∣tions, is apt to shut up the Pores all at once, and hinder insensible Perspiration. From hence proceed FEVERS, COUGHS, QUINSIES, PLEURISIES, and CONSUMPTI∣ONS, with a dismal Train of other Diseases,
<PB N="5" REF="003843_0003_10026338F27F17F0"/>
which make as fatal Havock here, in Pro∣portion to our Number, as the PLAGUE does in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Parts of the World.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, this is a cruel Check to the Growth of an Infant Colony, which otherwise, by the Fruitfulness of our Wo∣men, and the great Number of Recruits, sent from our Mother Country, would, in a few Years, grow populous, and conse∣quently considerable.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to see these Calami∣ties return every Year, without the tender∣est Commiseration. Certainly nothing can be more melancholly, than to have so ma∣ny poor People perish, purely for want of using timely Means for their Preservation. One Mischief is, most of our Inhabitants have such an unreasonable Aversion to <HI>Phy∣sick,</HI> (even where they may have it from their charitable Neighbours for nothing,) that they neglect to take any, 'til their Case is grown desperate, and Death begins to glare them in the Face. They consider not, that a moderate Skill may recover a Pati∣ent in the Beginning of a Distemper, while he has Strength to go thro' all the necessary Operations, when the whole <HI>College</HI> would not be able to save him, after his Spirits
<PB N="6" REF="003843_0004_10026370B939B050"/>
are sunk, and all the Principles of Life ve∣ry near extinguished.</P>
<P>THIS unhappy Temper occasions a great deal of Mortality: And what makes the Misfortune the greater, is, that it falls heaviest on the Younger Sort, who are most liable to hurrying Distempers. Indeed, some would be glad of Assistance, if they did not think the Remedy near as bad as the Dis∣ease: For our <HI>Doctors</HI> are commonly so ex∣orbitant in their Fees, whether they kill or cure, that the poor Patient had rather trust to his Constitution, than run the Risque of beggaring his Family.</P>
<P>THESE Considerations made me ac∣count it a Work of great Charity and Pub∣lick Spirit, to communicate to the poor In∣habitants of this Colony, a safe Method of curing themselves, when they shall be so unhappy as to fall into any of our common Maladies. And for their greater Encou∣ragement, the Remedies I shall prescribe, may be procured with little Trouble and Expence, being, for the most Part, such as grow at their own Doors, or may be easily propagated.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003843_0004_10026370B939B050"/>
PROVIDENCE has been so good, as to furnish almost every Country with Medicines proper for the Distempers inci∣dent to the Climate; and such Domestick Remedies are always sufficient for the Poor, who live upon homely Fare, and for the Temperate, who make a right Use of GOD's Blessings. Their Cases are seldom compli∣cated, and proceed, for the most Part, from Cold, or some slight Transgression. In such Ailments, the Symptoms cannot easily be mistaken, nor is the <HI>Cure</HI> difficult; all the <HI>Secret</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>taking the Distemper in Time:</HI> And this will be the more necessary, because most Diseases that happen from Cold, are excedingly violent, and call aloud for spee∣dy Assistance.</P>
<P>I MUST therefore conjure my dear Country folks, to begin with themselves as soon as they can distinguish what Sickness they have, while Nature is strong, and able to co-operate with the Medicines they take. Nor can we hope, that Heaven will assist us in our Calamities, unless we endeavour, at the same Time, to assist ourselves.</P>
<P>IN setting down the following Prescrip∣tions, I have been cautions of talking like
<PB N="8" REF="003843_0005_10039777120F17B8"/>
an <HI>Apothecary;</HI> that is, of using hard Words, that perhaps neither my Patient, nor my self understand. Nor have I taken them lightly upon Trust; but am able to recommend most of them upon more than Twenty Years Experience; and for the rest, I have credible Authority. In the mean Time, I hope, none will object, like <HI>Naa∣man,</HI> the <HI>Syrian,</HI> to the Easiness of any of these Remedies; but rather rejoice, that they can have the greatest of all Blessings so very cheap. And in Truth, People must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove Difficulty extremely, to slight Health, as they would a Mistress, for being gain'd with little Trouble.</P>
<P>BEFORE I mention the <HI>Cure,</HI> I shall endeavour to describe the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of each Distemper, in so plain a Manner, that any Person may be Master of his own Case, if he will but attend carefully to what he feels; otherwise he might mistake his Illness, and apply an improper Remedy. I shall also recommend the <HI>Diet</HI> fittest to be used in each Case; which often contributes more to the Patient's Recovery, than his <HI>Physick:</HI> At the same Time, he shall have my best Advice, to prevent every particular Ail∣ment; which will be happier for him, than to know how to cure it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003843_0005_10039777120F17B8"/>
I SHALL begin with the most fatal of all our Distempers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pleurisy.</NOTE> a PLEURISY; which discovers it self by a brisk Fever, and sharp▪ Pain, pretty low in one of the Sides, shoot∣ing now and then into the Breast, and some∣times quite back into the Shoulder-Blades: It is uneasy every Time the Patient draws his Breath, and more so when he coughs; which is generally the Case in this Disease.</P>
<P>THE Moment any Person finds these Tokens upon him, he must, without Loss of Time, take away 10 Ounces of <HI>Blood,</HI> and repeat the same three or four Days succes∣sively, if the Pain go not away before. On the third Day, he may vomit with 80 Grains of <HI>Indian Physick, (Ipecacuania,)</HI> and eve∣ry Night, drink 7 Spoonfuls of <HI>Pennyroyal Water,</HI> or the Decoction of it▪ moderately sweeten'd. In the mean Time, let him, every three Hours, take Half a Spoonful of <HI>Honey</HI> and <HI>Linseed Oyl,</HI> mixt together. He should also strew <HI>Indian Pepper,</HI> upon <HI>Pen∣nyroyal Plaister,</HI> and apply it very hot to the Place where the Pain lies, and be sure to keep himself warm, and abstain from cold Water: Tho' it the Distemper should prove obstinate, you must apply a <HI>Blister</HI> to his Neck, and one to each Arm, on the fleshy Part above the Elbow.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003843_0006_1002635AC98F1908"/>
THE Patient's <HI>Diet</HI> should be light, and cooling; and his constant Drink, either <HI>Linseed</HI> or <HI>Bawm Tea,</HI> a little sweeten'd.</P>
<P>THE best Way to prevent this Distem∣per, will be, to <HI>bleed</HI> in the Beginning of any great Hoarseness, or Cough, which are often the Forerunners of it; and also to forbear swilling great Quantities of Water, or Small Beer, in ordinary Life.</P>
<P>SOMETHING a-kin to this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fever, Pain in the Head, Breast, Eye, or Ear.</NOTE> is a FEVER, and PAIN IN THE HEAD, OR BREAST, or both; and now and then, an Inflammation, and Pain in the EYE, or EAR. In these Cases, you must, without Loss of Time, <HI>bleed</HI> 10 Ounces. The next Day, <HI>purge</HI> with the <HI>Decoction of Mallows,</HI> and 3 Spoonfuls of <HI>Syrup of Peach Blos∣soms.</HI> If the Pain should continue, you must <HI>bleed</HI> again the third Day, and the Morrow following repeat the <HI>Purge:</HI> And if the Pain be still obstinate, you must re∣new both <HI>Bleeding</HI> and <HI>Purging</HI> a third Time. In the very Beginning, apply the following <HI>Poultis</HI> to the Part where the Pain lies: Boil the Leaves of <HI>Sage, Wormwood,</HI> and <HI>Rue</HI> together, and having beat them soft, grate Nutmeg thick upon them, and
<PB N="11" REF="003843_0006_1002635AC98F1908"/>
bind them on warm, renewing the same Night and Morning: And in Case the Dis∣ease hold out against all this, your last Re∣fuge must be a <HI>Blister.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR <HI>Diet</HI> should be moist, and cool∣ing, such as <HI>Thin Hominy, Chicken-Breth,</HI> or <HI>Water-Gruel;</HI> and your Drink, <HI>Linseed,</HI> or <HI>Ground-Ivy Tea,</HI> moderately sweeten'd.</P>
<P>THIS Disease will be also best prevent∣ed by <HI>Bleeding</HI> in any violent Cold.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Distemper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quinsey.</NOTE> consequent to a Cold, is a QUINSEY, known by a Fever, with an Inflammation of the Glands about the Throat, and of the <HI>Uvula,</HI> to that Degree as to render all Swallowing difficult, and painful. For this, <HI>bleed</HI> immediately 10 Ounces, rather in the Jugular Vein, than in the Arm; and if the Case be urgent, ap∣ply a <HI>Blister</HI> to the Neck. If the Inflam∣mation should continue, <HI>bleed</HI> again next Day. The Morning after, take a <HI>Purge</HI> of the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Mallows,</HI> with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blossoms,</HI> repeating the same 3 several Times, resting one Day between. From the Beginning, <HI>gargle</HI> with Dr. <HI>Papa</HI>'s Liquor hereafter describ'd; and if the <HI>Uvu∣la</HI> be much relax'd, drink Half a Pint of
<PB N="12" REF="003843_0007_1002635C90697638"/>
the same, Night and Morning, when you don't purge.</P>
<P>BUT in Case it prove no more than a common SORE THROAT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sore-Throat.</NOTE> <HI>purge</HI> only once, and <HI>gargle</HI> with <HI>Papa</HI>'s Liquor.</P>
<P>IN both Cases, your <HI>Diet</HI> ought to be moist and cooling; and your Drink, <HI>Cinque∣foil Tea.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to prevent these Complaints, remember to wash your Neck, and behind your Ears, every Morning, in cold Water; nor muffle up your self too warm, either Night or Day.</P>
<P>NEXT follows a CONSUMPTION,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consump∣tion.</NOTE> a Distemper flow and sure, that is lately grown very common amongst us. Here Young People are more in Danger than their Elders, because more liable to Inflam∣mations. It is usher'd in by a Cough of long Continuance, which by Degrees in∣flames and ulcerates the Lungs, brings on a Hectick Fever, with a Spitting of bloody and corrupted Matter, and is generally at∣tended with a Hoarseness, and Night-Sweats. In the mean Time, the Patient will waste in Strength, and in Flesh, while
<PB N="13" REF="003843_0007_1002635C90697638"/>
perhaps he may eat rather more than he used to do when he was well.</P>
<P>AFTER the Ulcer comes to be formed in the Lungs, it will be difficult for inward Remedies to reach it. They may before that, perhaps, cool the Inflammation, as well as sweeten and diminish the sharp De∣fluxion, so as to prevent an Ulcer, but can rarely heal it. So likewise, <HI>Blisters</HI> and <HI>Issues</HI> may revulse the Humour, and pre∣vent the Mischief, if seasonably made use of.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, all the Good we can hope for, in this melancholly Case, must be done while the Consumption is appre∣hended only, and not actually begun. I would then recommend <HI>Bleeding</HI> 2 or 3 Ounces every third Day, with a constant Riding about on Horseback, and Change of Air. This will help Nature to throw off the Evil that threatens her, by calming the Blood, opening the Pores, and promo∣ting insensible Perspiration. It may also enable her to make a vigorous Effort, by Means of a seasonable Boil, or Imposthume, on the outward Parts of the Body. For that Intention, I would also advise the Pa∣tient, to <HI>shave</HI> under the Arms, and apply
<PB N="14" REF="003843_0008_10020429B6DBE260"/>
<HI>Poultises,</HI> in order to draw the Mischief, if possible, that Way. And for inward Me∣dicines, let him only chew <HI>Sassafras Root</HI> every Morning fasting. I would likewise intreat him, before he goes to Bed, to take 3 <HI>Pills,</HI> made of <HI>Turpentine</HI> and <HI>Deers Dung,</HI> in equal Quantities: And, besides these, let him once a Week take a <HI>Purge</HI> of <HI>Mallows,</HI> and <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blossoms.</HI></P>
<P>LET his <HI>Diet</HI> be without Meat, and mixt with abundance of <HI>Turnips, roasted Apples, Raisins,</HI> and <HI>Liquorice;</HI> and let his Drink be, Beer brew'd with <HI>Ground-Ivy;</HI> avoiding strong Liquors of every Sort, as he would Poison.</P>
<P>THE Way to prevent this wasting Dis∣ease, is never to suffer a Cough to dwell upon you; but <HI>bleed</HI> in Time, and <HI>purge</HI> gently once a Week. In the mean while, eat not one Morsel of Meat, nor drink any Thing stronger than a little sound <HI>Cider:</HI> And, to make the Game sure, ride every fair Day, and breath as much as possible in the open Air.</P>
<P>ANOTHER mischievous Distemper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bloody-Flux.</NOTE> is the BLOODY-FLUX; the Signs of which are, a small Fever, and grievous Griping.
<PB N="15" REF="003843_0008_10020429B6DBE260"/>
The Patient will also void slimy Excre∣ments, streak'd with Blood; and at the same Time, be cruelly tormented in his Bowels.</P>
<P>UPON the first Appearance of these Symptoms, part with 8 Ounces of <HI>Blood.</HI> The next Day take 80 Grains of <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> by Way of <HI>Vomit,</HI> and work it well with 2 Quarts of warm Water. The third Day, take 70 Grains of the same <HI>In∣dian Physick,</HI> in hot Broth, made pretty salt; and then 'twill go off by Way of Stool, and strengthen the Bowels.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, let the Food he takes, be either <HI>poach'd Eggs, Mutton,</HI> or <HI>Chicken-Broth,</HI> and his constant Drink, a <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>calcin'd Deers Horn,</HI> with a <HI>Plantain Leaf</HI> boil'd in it.</P>
<P>TO prevent this Disease, avoid sleeping on the cold Ground, and wading in the cold Water: Never eat immoderately of any Sort of Fruit, nor venture to drink new or foul Cider, by any Means.</P>
<P>AND because some People, by fancy∣ing this Distemper catching, are fearful of going near those unhappy Persons that have it, by which they often want the Assis∣tance
<PB N="16" REF="003843_0009_1002635756B5D3D8"/>
that is necessary; I may venture to assure them, their Apprehensions are ground∣less; and the Reason this Disease goes sometimes round a Family, is, because they live on the same Diet, and breath in the same Air; and then no Wonder if they fall into the same Disorders, one after ano∣ther, without any Manner of Infection.</P>
<P>THERE is also a Kind of WHITE-FLUX,<NOTE PLACE="marg">White-Flux.</NOTE> that will hurry a strong Man out of his Life in a short Time. In this Case, the Stools are frequent, without Gripes, or Blood, but flowing from the Patient like Water, and having a small Fever attend∣ing it.</P>
<P>LOSE no Time in this hasty Disease, but <HI>vomit</HI> with <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> and <HI>purge</HI> the next Day with the same. In the mean while, you will do well to wear some Skin girt tight on your Stomach and Belly, with the Furr next you, or else a Piece of soft Flannel.</P>
<P>LET your Food be <HI>Hasty-Pudding, Panada,</HI> or <HI>Broth thickened with Flower,</HI> and grate <HI>Nutmeg</HI> into every Thing you eat; and let your Drink be, a <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Deers Horn,</HI> made with a Leaf of <HI>Plaintain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003843_0009_1002635756B5D3D8"/>
IN order to prevent this Disorder, avoid Walking and Riding in the Night Air, guz∣zling huge Draughts of cold Water, and de∣vouring unreasonable Quantities of Fruit, especially of that which is not ripe.</P>
<P>A COMMON LOOSENESS needs no Description;<NOTE PLACE="marg">L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>seness.</NOTE> and may be easily stop'd in the Beginning; tho' some People husband it so well, as to keep it running for many Years: So that all the Humours of the Body taking that Turn, make it difficult to cure.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, to check this Ail∣ment in Time, you must <HI>vomit</HI> with <HI>Indian Physick;</HI> then live three or four Days upon <HI>new Milk, boil'd thick with Flower,</HI> or <HI>Tuckaho,</HI> and drink the abovementioned <HI>Deers Horn Decoction.</HI></P>
<P>THEN, to prevent it, eat not intem∣perately; nor drink windy, or soul Liquors, or too much cold Water.</P>
<P>BUT in Case of an ordinary GRIPING in the Belly, or WIND in the Stomach, drink a Gallon of <HI>warm Whey,</HI> and if that cannot be had, a Gallon of <HI>warm Water,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="003843_0010_1002634260DB5C98"/>
as fast as you can well swallow it: And af∣terwards <HI>purge</HI> with <HI>Mallows,</HI> and <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blossoms,</HI> once or twice.</P>
<P>FOR a few Days, content your self with a moderate and easy <HI>Diet;</HI> and let your Drink be <HI>Bawm Tea.</HI></P>
<P>IT may be prevented, by keeping your Back-door open, abstaining from windy Meats, and fermented Drinks, and being always careful not to overload your Sto∣mach.</P>
<P>THE COLICK is lately grown a ve∣ry common Distemper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colick.</NOTE> and begins, gene∣rally, with a grievous Pain in the Bowels; and, by being neglected, fixes at length in the Pit of the Stomach, where it seems to bore like an Augre: The Patient frequent∣ly vomits every Thing he swallows, and can hardly go to Stool, even with the Help of purging Medicines.</P>
<P>PEOPLE thus afflicted, are apt to fly to Drams for Relief; but with lamentable Success. These may ease a Fit sometimes; but are sure to add Fuel to the Fire, and make the Disease return with more Vio∣lence. Besides, these Cordials have another
<PB N="19" REF="003843_0010_1002634260DB5C98"/>
bad Consequence; they are apt to make People, soberly enough inclcin'd, by De∣grees, grow too fond of their Physick. To cure all which bad Effects at once, I would recommend this certain and easy Remedy: Let him leave off all strong, windy, and fermented Liquors, and drink nothing but <HI>Water,</HI> enrich'd with a very brown Toast.</P>
<P>BUT if this Remedy should be esteem'd worse than the Disease, I would, however, for the easing a particular Fit, recommend 2 or 3 Quarts of <HI>warm Water.</HI> And to force a Passage, you must take 2 or 3 Spoon∣fuls of <HI>Bears Oyl,</HI> which will seldom fail▪ or else drink a Quarter of a Pint of the <HI>De∣coction</HI> of <HI>Peach Leaves,</HI> with 2 Spoonfuls of <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blossoms:</HI> And this <HI>Purge</HI> you ought to repeat 2 or 3 Times, to car∣ry off all Remains. But if you would root out the Distemper for ever, take the same Medicines every full Moon; and drink every Morning, for some Time, <HI>Sassafras Tea;</HI> and at Night, take as much <HI>Snakeroot Powder</HI> as will lie upon a Sixpence, in <HI>Mint-Water,</HI> or <HI>Decoction.</HI></P>
<P>THE Food proper in this Distemper, is, <HI>Chicken,</HI> or <HI>Mutton Broth;</HI> and the Drink, <HI>Bawm Tea,</HI> sweeten'd with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Mallows.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="003843_0011_10026353D0B7D4B8"/>
AND, to prevent it, eat spearingly, for∣bearing every Thing that is salt, and windy; and never drink Spirits, one Drop of Green Tea, or brew'd Liquor of any Kind.</P>
<P>THE DRY GRIPES are now (blessed be God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dry Gripes.</NOTE>) grown much rarer than formerly. This is the cruellest Kind of <HI>Colick,</HI> called in <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Colick</HI> of <HI>Poitiers;</HI> though here it might be called the <HI>Caribbee Colick,</HI> because very common in those Islands: And I wish we may not have deriv'd it from thence, by too liberal a Use of their Com∣modities.</P>
<P>IT makes it self known by a most tor∣menting Pain in the Pit of the Stomach, and the adjacent Parts. The Guts feel as if they were twisted, and all Motion down∣ward is interrupted: By this Misfortune, the unhappy Patient is inclin'd to vomit up every Thing; insomuch, that sometimes his very Excrements are cast out at his Mouth. In the first Place, a Thoroughfare must by all Means be attempted, by 3 Spoonfuls of <HI>Bears Oyl,</HI> or by the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Peach Leaves,</HI> above mentioned. If these Re∣medies should fail, you must submit to a <HI>Tobacco Glister,</HI> perform'd by blowing the
<PB N="21" REF="003843_0011_10026353D0B7D4B8"/>
Smoak through a Pipe into the Fundament. And if the first Operation should happen to fail, it must be repeated. At the same Time, make a strong Infusion of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and therewith anoint the lower Region of the Belly.</P>
<P>AFTER the Passage is perfectly clear'd, your <HI>Diet,</HI> for some Days, ought to be ei∣ther <HI>Mutton,</HI> or <HI>Chicken Broth,</HI> in which <HI>Mallows</HI> have been boil'd; and your Drink, <HI>Pawm Tea.</HI></P>
<P>SOME have unadvisedly, in this Dis∣temper, ventur'd also to drink Rum, and other Spirits, to ease their Pains; but this has cost them dear, by taking away the Use of their Hands; and other <HI>Paralytick</HI> Mis∣fortunes; to cure which, the same Reme∣dies must be used, as are prescrib'd hereaf∣ter for the PALSEY.</P>
<P>THE best Way to prevent the DRY-GRIPES, is, to get rid of <HI>Agues,</HI> and <HI>Colicks,</HI> as soon as you can; to eat sparing∣ly of Fruit, and forbear all foul and windy Liquors; nor meddle with Rum, or other Spirit, after it has been poisoned with foul Sugar, and Lime-juice.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="003843_0012_1002633B9D9F1588"/>
A PALSEY comes suddenly upon us, with dreadful Symptoms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Palsey.</HI></NOTE> not easy to be mistaken. We are bereft of Sense, and Mo∣tion, either in one, or more Parts of the Bo∣dy; or at least, we find them numb'd and disabled: And where the Disease is extreme, one Side is taken quite motionless, and in∣sensible.</P>
<P>AT the first Appearance of these me∣lancholly Tokens, <HI>purge</HI> with <HI>Indian Phy∣sick</HI> every other Day, for 3 Times. The Mornings you don't <HI>purge,</HI> cause your self to be plung'd over Head and Ears into cold Water; and this should be repeated thrice every Week, for 3 Months together. You are also to mix equal Quantities of <HI>Spirit of Scurvy-grass,</HI> and <HI>Hungary Water,</HI> and dipping a stiff Comb-brush therein, cause your Head, being close shav'd, to be well brush'd with it several Times a Day: Like∣wise let the Palms of your Hands, the Soles of your Feet, and Nape of your Neck, be often rubb'd with the same Mixture. Af∣ter this has put some Sense and Motion in∣to your Limbs, beat <HI>Rosemary</HI> in a Mortar, and make a little Ball of it, which you must roll and work about in your Hands conti∣nually, renewing the same every Day: Now
<PB N="23" REF="003843_0012_1002633B9D9F1588"/>
and then too, put Tobacco up your Nos∣trils, letting it lie there for some Time, in order to derive the clammy Plegm from your Brain. These easy Remedies will, by the Grace of GOD, do great good in the Beginning of this Disease, by restoring the Nerves to their natural Tone, and giving new Vigour to the Animal Spirits, which have been clogg'd and obstructed.</P>
<P>THE Patient's Food should be dry, and of easy Digestion, with <HI>Mustard</HI> and <HI>Horse-Radish</HI> mixt with it; and let <HI>Sage,</HI> or <HI>Bawm Tea,</HI> be his constant Drink.</P>
<P>TO prevent this Distemper, feed seldom on salt, or high season'd Dishes; nor eat much Milk, or other flegmatick Food: Never sleep in the dangerous Dew, or on the moist Ground, or continue long in a Cellar, or other damp Situation. Use much Exercise, and let your Motion be always nimble, in order to quicken the Circulation, and frisk your sluggish Spirits.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Disease of the Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epilepsy.</HI></NOTE> is, an EPILEPSY, or FALLING SICK∣NESS, not unusual in this Country. It discovers it self by very terrible Symptoms: The unhappy Person falls down suddenly,
<PB N="24" REF="003843_0013_1002636349FD6750"/>
depriv'd of all Sense and Understanding. No sooner is he fallen, but he's immediate∣ly shaken with strong Convulsions, grinds his Teeth, rolls his Eye-balls, and foams at the Mouth in a most frightful Manner. So soon as the Fit is over, his Senses re∣turn, but commonly a Pain in the Head, and great Depression of the Spirits, remain upon him for some Time after. The Re∣turn of these melancholly Fits is uncertain, tho', for the most Part, they come near the Full, or change of the Moon.</P>
<P>IN the first Place, Care should be ta∣ken, to calm the Spirits of the Patient, and keep them from running Riot in this un∣happy Manner. For that Intention, <HI>bleed</HI> him, and then burn Feathers often under his Nose, or else Leather, or the Hoofs of any Animal.</P>
<P>FOUR Days before the Full Moon, let him take a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Indian Physick;</HI> and 4 Days after the Full Moon, let him take a <HI>Purge</HI> of the same; and be sure to do the like again, before and after the Change: And this must be repeated for Se∣ven Months together. On the Mornings when he takes no Physick, he must swal∣low as much <HI>Powder</HI> of <HI>Misleto,</HI> as will
<PB N="25" REF="003843_0013_1002636349FD6750"/>
lie upon a Shilling, in a Spoonful of the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Pennyroyal.</HI></P>
<P>FOR this Purpose, the Leaves and tender Twigs of <HI>Misleto</HI> must be gather'd in <HI>January,</HI> (being then in its Prime,) dry'd over an Oven moderately warm, and kept all the Year for the Use above men∣tioned.</P>
<P>LET the Patient's Head be shaved, and a Plaister made of the Juice of <HI>Rue, Sage,</HI> and <HI>Pennyroyal,</HI> worn on the back Part of it.</P>
<P>LET him often put <HI>Tobacco</HI> up one of his Nostrils, keeping it there as long as it has any Strength, to clear the Head of cold and clammy Phlegm. And let him now and then, besides, chew a Stick of <HI>Misleto, </HI> and swallow the Juice.</P>
<P>THESE Directions must be pursu'd Seven Months, or more, to cure any Per∣son intirely of this Distemper; and, if it be taken in Time, there will be great Proba∣bility of Success, at least in young Peo∣ple.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="003843_0014_100263495AC38C18"/>
LET his Victuals be sparing, and easy of Digestion; and his constant Drink, ei∣ther <HI>Sage,</HI> or <HI>Bawm Tea.</HI></P>
<P>AS People commonly fall first into this Misfortune while they are Children, so, in order to prevent it, Care should be taken, never to fright, or strike them violently on the Head, Back-bone, or Nape of the Neck.</P>
<P>A FEVER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fever, with vio∣lent Pur∣ging and Vomiting▪</NOTE> WITH VIOLENT PURGING AND VOMITING, can't easily be mistaken. The Stools, though frequent, are with great Pain, and Difficulty: Both the Stomach and Bowels feel exceedingly uneasy, and the whole Frame is in universal Disorder.</P>
<P>AS this Disease will hurry a Man soon to his long Home, without speedy Help, you must forthwith make 2 Gallons of thin <HI>Broth,</HI> either of Half a Fowl, or a small Chicken, and drink it all in the Space of 2 or 3 Hours: Some of this will come up, and some go down, and cleanse your Sto∣mach and Bowels in such a Manner, as to make you well before you expect it.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="003843_0014_100263495AC38C18"/>
ONLY be careful to live some Days upon light and innocent Fare, boiling <HI>Mint</HI> in every Thing you eat, and grating <HI>Nut∣meg</HI> into all your Drink.</P>
<P>WOULD you prevent this boistrous Illness, forbear all Kind of Surfeiting and Excess, never exposing your self to be wet to the Skin, if possible.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit a FEVER AND AGUE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fever and Ague.</NOTE> which is an Epidemick Distemper in this moist and variable Climate. 'Tis true, it seldom kills now a Days; but if neglected too long, corrupts all the Juices of the Body, and ends either in a <HI>Jaundice, Dropsy, Dry Grypes,</HI> or <HI>Cachexy:</HI> There∣fore I conjure all my good Patients, as they tender their Health, and their Looks, to dispossess this <HI>Devil</HI> as soon as they can.</P>
<P>AN AGUE returns either every Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ague.</NOTE> every third, or every fourth Day; and the Way to know which of these any Person hath, is, only to abide 2 Fits. If it come every Day, it will be often accompanied with a Pain in the Head: In which Case, after the second Fit, you must <HI>bleed</HI> S Oun∣ces. The next Day, <HI>purge</HI> with <HI>Indian
<PB N="28" REF="003843_0015_10026331F88B6338"/>
Physick,</HI> and 2 Days after that, repeat the same again. This must be followed, by taking, every Morning and Evening, 20 Grains of the <HI>Powder</HI> of <HI>Sassafras-root,</HI> mixt with 10 Grains of <HI>Snake-root,</HI> in 2 Spoonfuls of the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Wormwood.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Fit return every third Day, omit <HI>Bleeding,</HI> in Case there be no Pain. After the second Fit, <HI>vomit</HI> one Day with <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> and <HI>purge</HI> with the same the next. If these should not master the Distemper, you must compleat the Cure with the <HI>Pow∣ders</HI> of <HI>Sassafras,</HI> and <HI>Snakeroot,</HI> taken in the Manner aforesaid.</P>
<P>BUT in Case the Return should be every fourth Day, you must, after the <HI>Vo∣mit</HI> and <HI>Purge,</HI> take a <HI>Cold-Water Sweat:</HI> That is, so soon as the cold Fit is off, and the Fever begins to come on, go into na∣ked Bed, and drink a Pint of <HI>cold Water:</HI> Then cover your self up, and in a little Time, the Disease will be driven all out at your Pores. However, take the <HI>Powders</HI> after this Operation for some Time, that you may make sure Work of it.</P>
<P>YOUR <HI>Diet</HI> should be moist, and tem∣perate; and Drink, <HI>Cinquefoil Tea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003843_0015_10026331F88B6338"/>
IT would be difficult to prescribe Rules to prevent a Distemper, to which our Situ∣ation is so unhappily subject: However, Prudence may be useful, even in this Case. Ride therefore a great deal in the hot Months, to sweat out all ill digested Humours; and don't chill your Bowels too much with cold Water. Avoid, as much as may be, being abroad in the Rain, or in the Dews of the Night. Be cautious too, of sleeping on the Ground, or with your Windows, or Doors open, to let the Wind blow upon you.</P>
<P>IN Case of a CONTINUAL FEVER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continual Fever.</NOTE> <HI>bleed</HI> immediately 10 Ounces. The Day follow∣ing, <HI>vomit</HI> with <HI>Indian Physick;</HI> and the Morning after, <HI>purge</HI> with the same. And if you should be light headed, be convuls'd, or incline too much to Sleep, lay a large <HI>Blister</HI> to the Neck, and to the fleshy Parts of each Arm; and take a <HI>Glister</HI> every Night, of <HI>Mallows,</HI> and <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blossoms,</HI> to abate the Heat of the Distem∣ger.</P>
<P>IT matters not how little People eat in one of these <HI>Fevers,</HI> because the Spirits re∣quisite for Digestion, are employ'd in strug∣gling
<PB N="30" REF="003843_0016_1002634BE7D66CE0"/>
with the Disease: But what little Sus∣tenance they do take, should be moist, and cooling; and their Drink, a <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Cinquefoil.</HI></P>
<P>TO prevent this furious Malady, avoid all Excesses of strong Drink, especially of Spirits, which inflame the Blood, at the same Time that they vitiate the Ferment of the Stomach; upon which all Digesti∣on, and consequently all Health, depends.</P>
<P>BUT there is a SLOW FEVER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slow Fe∣ver.</NOTE> more dif∣ficult to manage than all the rest, which is the true SCORBUTICK FEVER. The Signs of it are, a low, but quick Pulse, a constant Thirst, a Falling away of the Flesh, and a sallow Complexion. There will be some∣times too, a hard Swelling on one Side of the Belly, that seems to move about.</P>
<P>AS this lurking Disorder comes by a long Course of ill Management, so it will need some Time to root it out. For that End, take a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Indian Physick,</HI> and the next Morning, a <HI>Purge</HI> of the same; which <HI>Purge</HI> ought to be repeated once a Week, for 6 Times at least. The Morn∣ings you don't take <HI>Physick,</HI> drink constant∣ly a Quarter of a Pint of <HI>Sassafras Tea,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="003843_0016_1002634BE7D66CE0"/>
fasting; and every Night, as much <HI>Pow∣der</HI> of <HI>Snakeroot</HI> as will lie upon a Shilling, in 3 Spoonfuls of <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Dittany.</HI> And if you should be costive, take a <HI>Glister</HI> every other Day, of <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Mallows,</HI> with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Peach Blossoms.</HI> This Me∣thod, faithfully pursued, for 2 Months, with moderate Riding, and a proper <HI>Diet,</HI> will go near to finish the Cure.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, eat no Milk, nor any Thing salt, or hard of Digestion: But let your Sauce be <HI>Mustard, Garden Cres∣ses,</HI> and <HI>Horse-radish</HI> in abundance; and your best Drink will be, found <HI>Cider,</HI> with a hot Iron quench'd in it, or Beer brew'd with <HI>Sorrel Tree Leaves.</HI></P>
<P>THEN, to prevent this Illness, you must indulge no sloathful Inclination; but stir about your Business briskly, and ride as often as you can: Never drink more than a Pint of Water, or other Drink, in 24 Hours. Breath as much as possible in the open Air, in the Day Time, and avoid it in the Night.</P>
<P>THERE is besides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worm-Fever.</NOTE> another Kind of FEVER, hard to be distinguish'd, especi∣ally among children; and that is a WORM-FEVER.
<PB N="32" REF="003843_0017_10026336383A2A40"/>
There will be a quick Pulse, and often a Pain in the Side, in the Stomach, or Bowels, and all occasioned by Worms. Now and then too, there will be the Symp∣toms of the <HI>Flux,</HI> and even Convulsions; so that, like the Devil, it appears in all Man∣ner of Shapes. The only Way I know, of discerning it, is, by a swell'd Belly, a taint∣ed Breath, or a greedy Appetite, beyond what is usual in other feverish Disorders.</P>
<P>GIVE a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Indian Physick</HI> one Day, and a <HI>Purge</HI> of the same the next. Beat the <HI>Seed</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem Oak,</HI> and take a Spoonful of it, mixt with the <HI>Juice</HI> of <HI>Rue,</HI> or <HI>Wormwood,</HI> for 3 Mornings. From the Beginning, soak a cur'd <HI>Leaf</HI> of <HI>Tobacco</HI> in <HI>Vinegar,</HI> and apply it warm to the Sto∣mach, or Belly; and it will make the Worms much sicker than it doth the Patient.</P>
<P>LET his Food be season'd with a great deal of Salt; and his Drink, Beer brew'd pretty bitter, with <HI>Wormwood</HI> instead of <HI>Hops.</HI></P>
<P>IT is difficult to hinder Worms from hatching, and harbouring in our Bodies, because we swallow their Eggs almost with every Thing we eat; especially such as live
<PB N="33" REF="003843_0017_10026336383A2A40"/>
much upon <HI>Pulse,</HI> and <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> will be full of them. So that I may venture to say, Three Fourths of the Children that die in these Parts of the World, die of <HI>Worms.</HI></P>
<P>THE best Way to prevent them, is, to make use of a great deal of <HI>Pepper</HI> and <HI>Salt</HI> with your daily Food, and as little <HI>Vinegar</HI> as possible, which is full of small <HI>Insects,</HI> not to be seen without a Glass.</P>
<P>I TOOK Notice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cachexy.</NOTE> that a CACHEXY was one of the Consequences of letting a <HI>Fever</HI> and <HI>Ague</HI> continue too long; tho' the same is produced likewise by an un∣wholesome <HI>Diet,</HI> by a sloathful Habit, and drinking abundance of cold Water. The Signs of it are, a slow Fever, of the <HI>Hectick</HI> Kind, a continual Thirst, a Short∣ness of Breath, and very cadaverous Com∣plexion.</P>
<P>FOR the Cure of this lazy Distemper, you must proceed in the same Method as is directed in the Case of <HI>slow Fevers:</HI> Only I would advise the Patient, over and above, to take every Day, at 10 in the Morning, and 4 in the Afternoon, a Dram of <HI>Rum,</HI> wherein the <HI>Flowers</HI> and <HI>Tops</HI> of <HI>Centory</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="003843_0018_1002635119EB25A8"/>
have been infus'd; and, during the whole Course of the Cure, the Patient must by all Means, shake off his lazy Disposition, rise early in a Morning, and stir about as brisk∣ly as his Strength and Breath will permit.</P>
<P>HIS Food should be fresh, and easy of Digestion; and his Drink. Beer brew'd with <HI>Wormwood,</HI> and the <HI>Leaves</HI> of the <HI>Sorrel Tree.</HI></P>
<P>TO prevent falling into it, never suffer <HI>Agues,</HI> or <HI>slow Fevers,</HI> to taint your Blood; be nimble in your Motion, and drench not your self with cold Water, between Meals.</P>
<P>ANOTHER bad Effect of keeping an <HI>Ague</HI> too long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yellow-Jaundice.</NOTE> is, the YELLOW JAUN∣DICE. This discovers it self by the yellow Hue of the Face, and other Parts of the Body: Nay, the Whites of the Eyes, and Urine, will be also ting'd with it.</P>
<P>FOR this Illness, take a <HI>Purge</HI> of <HI>In∣dian Physick,</HI> and repeat it the third Day again. After that, drink every Morning, and Evening, for 6 Weeks, a Quarter of a Pint of <HI>Decoction</HI> of the <HI>inner Bark</HI> of <HI>Elder,</HI> and the <HI>Root</HI> of <HI>Sassafras,</HI> in Equal Quantities. In the mean Time,
<PB N="35" REF="003843_0018_1002635119EB25A8"/>
force your self to stir about, and ride on Horseback every fair Day.</P>
<P>LET all your Victuals be light, and temperate; and your Drink, Beer brew'd with <HI>Sorrel Leaves, Pine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ops, Root</HI> of <HI>Ash,</HI> and a little <HI>old Iron.</HI></P>
<P>TO ward off this ungracious Disease, cure your <HI>Agues</HI> in the Beginning, lingring <HI>Fevers</HI> as soon as possible, and use Agility in your Motion.</P>
<P>BUT the most fatal Consequence of keeping an <HI>Ague,</HI> or <HI>Jaundice</HI> too long, is, a DROPSY. This dire Calamity befals an∣cient People sometimes, by Means of natu∣ral Decay; and sometimes, those that are young, when they have made too bold with their Constitution. 'Tis also apt to follow too great a Loss of Blood, or too long a Familiarity with Opiats.</P>
<P>A DROPSY first shews it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dropsy.</NOTE> by the Swelling of the Legs about the Ancles, in such a Manner as to retain the Impression of your Finger. The Swelling appears most at Night, and is usually attended with a Shortness and Difficulty of Breath, ever most troublesome when the Patient lies down.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="003843_0019_10026346977FBF40"/>
HE must therefore resolve upon proper Remedies, before the Waters rise high enough to drown him: And, if he have but the Gift of Self-denyal, he may, by God's Help, get the better of this mortal Enemy; provided there be no universal Decay, no Depravation of the Liver, or other Organs, necessary for Blood-making.</P>
<P>NOW I can't recommend the Reme∣dies for this Disease better, than by giving Three remarkable Instances, of Persons of an advanc'd Age, who have been perfectly cur'd by them.</P>
<P>THE First was, Sir <HI>Thomas Millington,</HI> an eminent Physician, who fell into a <HI>Dropsy,</HI> at near 70 Years of Age. After draining the Water, by 2 or 3 smart <HI>Pur∣ges,</HI> he perform'd the rest of the Cure by a resolute Self-denyal. He eat nothing but what was light, and nourishing; and for his Drink, confin'd himself rigorously to a Quarter of a Pint of <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wine in 24 Hours: (And hard <HI>Cider</HI> would have done the Business as well.) The first Week, his Thirst was hardly to be endured; but after that, grew more tolerable. He con∣tined this Course for 2 Months, and recover'd compleatly.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="003843_0019_10026346977FBF40"/>
THE Second, was the late <HI>Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Or∣ford,</HI> who had this Distemper in his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>macterick.</HI> He <HI>purg'd</HI> 2 or 3 Times, drank sparingly of <HI>Canary</HI> and <HI>Water, thickened</HI> with the <HI>Yolk</HI> of a <HI>new-laid Egg;</HI> and all his Victuals besides were cook'd with abundance of <HI>Garlick,</HI> and <HI>Horse-radish.</HI> This Method was pursued with great Con∣stancy for 3 Months, and blest with intire Success.</P>
<P>THE Last Instance, is an <HI>Ancient Gen∣tleman,</HI> who trusted to the Remedies of our own Country, with the like happy Effect. He drank the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Sassa∣fras,</HI> as soon as he got up, and chew'd the <HI>Root</HI> of it all the rest of the Morning, 'til Dinner; then observ'd a light, and nourish∣ing <HI>Diet;</HI> and drank moderately of clear found <HI>Cider,</HI> wherein a <HI>hot Iron</HI> had been plentifully quench'd.</P>
<P>OF these several Remedies, you may please to take your choice: Or, instead of <HI>Sassafras,</HI> you may hold the <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>Pel∣litary of Spain</HI> in your Mouth, which will salivate still more powerfully.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="003843_0020_1002634DA68FDF38"/>
THE rest of the Cure must be com∣pleated with restorative Meats, and a very short Allowance of Drink. For your <HI>Diet,</HI> I would recommend <HI>Poach'd Eggs, Thin Hominy, Hoggs Feet, Cow Heel,</HI> and <HI>Jel∣ly Broth:</HI> all which will renew, and enrich the Blood, without provoking too much Thirst: And for Drink, use none, but <HI>Sor∣rel Beer,</HI> or sound <HI>Cider,</HI> wherein a <HI>hot Iron</HI> has been quench'd several Times.</P>
<P>TO guard your self against this wretch∣ed Distemper, be cautious of scorching your Liver, with Spirits, or Excess of other strong Drink. In Case you be troubled with <HI>Bleed∣ing,</HI> stop it as soon as you can. By no means accustom your self to <HI>Opiats,</HI> or suffer an <HI>Ague,</HI> the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> or lingring <HI>Fevers,</HI> to dwell long upon you.</P>
<P>BECAUSE I mentioned Loss of Blood to be one Cause of the <HI>Dropsy,</HI> I will hint at some Means to stanch those BLEEDINGS that threaten the most Danger.</P>
<P>IN Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bleeding-Piles.</HI></NOTE> the excessive FLUX OF THE BLEEDING PILES sometimes ends in a <HI>Drop∣sy,</HI> if not stop'd in Time. In that Case, <HI>purge</HI> with <HI>Indian Physick</HI> 2 or 3 Times;
<PB N="39" REF="003843_0020_1002634DA68FDF38"/>
and the Mornings you do'nt do that, drink the <HI>Exprest Liquor</HI> of <HI>fresh Ass-dung,</HI> sweetened with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Quinces,</HI> to be re∣peated 3 Times. In the mean while, take an Ounce of <HI>Conserve</HI> of <HI>Roses,</HI> twice or thrice a Day; and after every Stool, wash your Fundament clean with <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Comfry Leaves,</HI> made very warm.</P>
<P>LIVE all the Time upon a cooling <HI>Diet,</HI> without Meat; and only drink <HI>Bur∣net,</HI> or <HI>Yarrow Tea,</HI> sweetened with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Quinces.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE that are liable to this, or the like Infirmities, should avoid heating them∣selves with strong Drink, or too boistrous Motion; nor must they fall into violent Passions, either of Love or Anger.</P>
<P>IN Women,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Flooding.</HI></NOTE> a <HI>Dropsy</HI> is often caus'd by FLOODING, OR THE IMMODERATE FLOW∣ING OF THEIR COURSES. Let them for this, in the first Place, take away 8 Ounces of <HI>Blood,</HI> and then proceed as in the forego∣ing Case; only they must inject the <HI>Decoc∣tion</HI> of <HI>Comfry Leaves,</HI> and govern their Passions, if they can; nor must any Part of them, not so much as their Tongue, be allow'd to have too much Motion.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="003843_0021_10026340D462B830"/>
THE BLEEDING AT THE NOSE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bleeding at the nose</NOTE> must be treated just in the same Manner, except, the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Comfry Leaves</HI> shou'd be often snufft up the Nose, and a Tent soak'd in the same frequently thrust into the Nostrils: And if a little <HI>Allom</HI> were dissolv'd in the <HI>Decoction,</HI> it wou'd be so much the better.</P>
<P>THEN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spitting, or Pissing of Blood.</NOTE> for SPITTING, or PISSING OF BLOOD, <HI>bleed</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ounces.

<P>IN the WHITES too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whites.</NOTE> I won'd recom∣mend <HI>Bleeding</HI> in the Beginning; and <HI>Purging</HI> 2 or 3 Times, with <HI>Indian Physick.</HI> When the don't <HI>purge,</HI> let her, Night and Morning, drink Half a Pint of <HI>Papa's</HI> Li∣quor, with an Ounce of <HI>Conserve</HI> of <HI>Roses</HI> dissolv'd in it; and often inject the same. For the rest, she must use the same <HI>Diet,</HI> the same <HI>Drink,</HI> the same moderate Mo∣tion, and Freedom from Passion, as are mention'd before.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="003843_0021_10026340D462B830"/>
A GLEET,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gleet.</NOTE> or RUNNING OF THE REINS, in Men, must be treated in all Respects as the foregoing Weakness in the other Sex; provided always, it be not Venereal.</P>
<P>THERE's no Disease puzzles <HI>Phy∣sicians</HI> more than the VAPOURS, and HYSTERICK FITS. These Complaints are produced by so many Causes, and ap∣pear in so many various Shapes, that 'tis no easy Matter to describe them. How∣ever, some of the <HI>Symptoms</HI> are, a Thump∣ing at the Heart, a Croaking of the Guts, and a Fulness of the Stomach, which the Patient endeavours to ease, as much as she can, by Belching: Every now and then too, something seems to rise up to her Throat, that almost stops her Breath: She has moreover, a great Heaviness, and De∣jection of Spirit, and a Cloud seems to hang upon all her Senses. In one Word, she has no Relish for any thing, but is con∣tinually out of Humour, she knows not why, and out of Order, she knows not where.</P>
<P>THIS is certainly a miserable Condi∣tion, how much soever it may be ridicul'd, as whimsical and imaginary; and 'tis the
<PB N="42" REF="003843_0022_1002042EACE174C8"/>
more so, because the Weakness of the Nerves makes the Cure exceeding difficult.</P>
<P>BECAUSE the <HI>Stomach</HI> is suspected to be much in Fault, I wou'd have That cleans'd in the first Place, with a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Indian Physick:</HI> The next Day, purify the <HI>Bowels,</HI> by a <HI>Purge</HI> of the same; which must be repeated 2 Days after. The rest of the <HI>Cure</HI> must be perform'd by the ex∣act Observation of the following <HI>Rules.</HI> Endeavour to preserve a cheerful Spirit, putting the best Construction upon every body's Words, and Behaviour: Plunge, 3 Mornings every Week, into cold Water, over Head and Ears; or if you have no Convenience for that, it will have the same Effect, if you suffer your self to be whip'd with smart little Rods. It can't be ima∣gin'd how this will brace the Nerves, and rouze the sluggish Spirits, (as some grave Gentlemen find, when they try it for a merrier Purpose.) Observe a strict Regu∣larity and Temperance in your <HI>Diet;</HI> and ride, every fair Day, small Journeys, on Horseback. Stir nimbly about your Affairs, quick Motion being as necessary for Health of Body, as for Dispatch of Business. In the mean while, I absolutely forbid all sorts of <HI>Drams,</HI> which will raise the Spirits
<PB N="43" REF="003843_0022_1002042EACE174C8"/>
only to sink them lower; nor do I allow her one Pinch of <HI>Snuff,</HI> or one Drop of <HI>Bo∣hea-Tea,</HI> tho' it were to save her Longing.</P>
<P>HER <HI>Food</HI> must be fresh; and easy of Digestion, neither salt, nor windy; nor may she eat one Morsel of <HI>Beef,</HI> which affords a gross Nourishment, and inclines People, too much, to hang themselves. And for her <HI>Drink,</HI> she must forbear <HI>Beer,</HI> with all windy and fermented Liquors; and stick to <HI>Bawm-Tea</HI> intirely.</P>
<P>TO escape this Disorder, she must suf∣fer none of the idle Disturbances, or Dis∣appointments of an empty World, to prey upon her Mind, or ruffle her sweet Temper. Let her use just Exercise enough to give a gentle Spring to her Spirits, without Wasting them; and let her be cheerful, in Spite of a churlish Husband, or cloudy Weather.</P>
<P>NOW I am upon <HI>Female Infirmities,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppression of the Courses.</NOTE> it will not be unseasonable to touch upon a common Complaint among unmarry'd Women, namely, THE SUPPRESSION OF THE COURSES. This don't only dis∣parage their Complexions, but fills them, besides, with sundry Disorders. For this
<PB N="44" REF="003843_0023_1002635F24086550"/>
Misfortune, you must <HI>purge</HI> with <HI>Highland F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agg,</HI> (commonly call'd <HI>Belly-ach Root</HI>) a Week before you expect to be out of Order; and repeat the same 2 Days after: The next Morning, drink a Quarter of a Pint of <HI>Pennyroyal Water,</HI> or <HI>Decoction,</HI> with 12 Drops of <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Harts-horn,</HI> and as much again at Night, when you go to Bed. Continue this, 9 Days running; and after Resting 3 Days, go on with it for 9 more. Ride out every fair Day, stir nimbly about your Affairs, and breath as much as possible in the open Air.</P>
<P>YOU must feed upon a warm and cor∣dial <HI>Diet,</HI> enrich'd with a great deal of <HI>Mustard, Nutmeg, Horse-raddish,</HI> and <HI>Garden-Cresses;</HI> at the same time avoiding every thing that is astringent, flegmatick, and windy. And let your <HI>Drink</HI> be <HI>Beer,</HI> brew'd with <HI>Sorrel-Leaves,</HI> or else <HI>Ground-Ivy-Tea.</HI></P>
<P>TO prevent this Complaint, young Women must shake off Sloath, and make Use of their Legs, as well as their Hands▪ They shou'd be cautious of taking <HI>Opiats</HI> too often, or <HI>Jesuits-Bark,</HI> except in Ca∣ses of great Necessity; nor must they long for <HI>pretty Fellows,</HI> or any other <HI>Trash,</HI> whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="003843_0023_1002635F24086550"/>
HEAVEN be prais'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stone in the Blad∣der.</NOTE> there is little Occasion to say any thing of the STONE IN THE BLADDER, there being few Instances of it in this Colony. Among the Gentry, the <HI>Madeira Wine,</HI> which has but little <HI>Tartar</HI> in it, and the <HI>Molosses Beer,</HI> being soft and cleansing, are happy Defences against this Scourge of Luxury and Lazi∣ness: And then, for the common Planters, their <HI>Pone,</HI> and other Preparations of <HI>In∣dian Corn,</HI> being smooth and slippery, are likewise excellent Preservatives.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gravel.</NOTE> some few of us by sitting too long either at our Book, or our Bottle, have, now and then, some Touches of the GRAVEL, or STONE IN THE KIDNEYS. This makes it self known, by a Pain across the Loins, by Urine ting'd with Blood, and mix'd with Sand and jagged little Stones: The Sto∣mach too is sometimes affected, and inclin'd to vomit.</P>
<P>WHEN you find these concurring <HI>Symptoms,</HI> drink 3 or 4 Quarts of <HI>Whey,</HI> as fast as you can, wherein the <HI>Root</HI> of <HI>Prickley Pear</HI> has been boil'd. When that has all past, squeeze the <HI>Juice</HI> of <HI>Wild Gar∣lick</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="003843_0024_100263338198E3C8"/>
into clean found <HI>Cider,</HI> and drink a moderate Glass of it Night and Morning, for 6 or 7 Days.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, let your Food be <HI>thin Hominy,</HI> or <HI>Broth,</HI> with a few <HI>Mal∣lows</HI> boil'd in it; and your Drink, a <HI>De∣coction</HI> of <HI>Mallows,</HI> sweetened with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Violets.</HI></P>
<P>AND the Way to ward off this pain∣ful Disease, is to be temperate in all your Enjoyments, to eat a great deal of <HI>Milk,</HI> and Meats made of <HI>Indian Corn;</HI> but above all Things, be cautious of sit∣ting still too much.</P>
<P>A COMMON Consequence of the <HI>Gravel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppression of Urine.</NOTE> is, a SUPPRESSION OF URINE, oc∣casioned, sometimes, by small Stones lodg∣ing in the narrow Passages, that lead from the Kidneys to the Bladder. The Signs of this Complaint are too plain to any one who has his Feeling; and, to cure it, you must proceed in much the same Method as for the <HI>Gravel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> only you should add <HI>Parsley-Tea</HI> to you Drink, sweeten'd with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Violets.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="003843_0024_100263338198E3C8"/>
BUT if the Suppression arise from an Ulcer, or Inflammation in the Neck of the Bladder, then the Symptoms are, a great Heat, and Pain in that Part, with an ur∣gent Pain to make Water, but a Disabili∣ty to do it at all, or, at most, not faster than Drop by Drop.</P>
<P>FOR this, boil one Part of <HI>Oyl,</HI> with two Parts of good <HI>Cider,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> swal∣low a Spoonful, Night and Morning.</P>
<P>LET your <HI>Diet</HI> all the while be cool∣ing, and easy of Digestion; and your Drink, <HI>Parsley Tea,</HI> or <HI>Cider,</HI> with a <HI>Plantain Leaf</HI> boil'd in it.</P>
<P>TO prevent this Ailment, eat seldom of pepper'd, or high-season'd Meats; and drink moderately of hot Liquors: Though above all Things, you must forbear using artificial Provocatives, to recommend you to the delightful Sex; but, for that, let Na∣ture be your only Prompter.</P>
<P>THE Symptoms of the BLIND PILES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blind Piles.</NOTE> are, little painful Swellings, appearing just without the Fundament. They are occa∣sioned by the slowing of corrupted Blood
<PB N="48" REF="003843_0025_10026366C8989F60"/>
into the Vessels thereabouts, which some∣times creates so much Anguish, as to put the Patient into a <HI>Fever,</HI> and render every Posture uneasy.</P>
<P>FOR this Complaint, take every Morn∣ing fasting, in the <HI>Yolk</HI> of a <HI>new laid Egg,</HI> 12 Grains of <HI>Brimstone,</HI> finely powder'd; and wash it down with a small Draught of <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Mallows.</HI> And to asswage the Pain, make Use of this <HI>outward Ap∣plication:</HI> Stamp a <HI>roasted Onion,</HI> with a little <HI>Ointment</HI> of <HI>James-Town Weed;</HI> which must be laid on warm, and renew'd twice a Day.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, the afflicted Person's <HI>Diet</HI> ought to be moderate and cooling, without Meat of any Kind; and his con∣stant <HI>Drink, Milk</HI> and <HI>Water.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, in order to prevent this Affliction, and root it out for ever, use the following Remedy. Boil a Handful of <HI>Mullein Leaves</HI> in a Pint of <HI>new Milk,</HI> and sweeten it with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Violets.</HI> Drink this every Night, for 6 Weeks together, just before you go to Rest.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="003843_0025_10026366C8989F60"/>
A RUPTURE is a common Misfortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture.</NOTE> especially among <HI>Children.</HI> The Tokens of it are, a painful Swelling and Inflamma∣tion in the Codds, occasion'd by a Fall, or other Violence, that forces down the Guts into that Part, and is most painful when the Accident first happens.</P>
<P>FOR this, let the Patient immediately have a <HI>Truss</HI> made, that may hold the Part suspended. Then apply fresh <HI>Cow-Dung,</HI> which must be renewed Night and Morn∣ing, till the Pains are asswaged. After that, put on another <HI>Poultis,</HI> made of the <HI>Roots</HI> of <HI>Swamp-Lillies,</HI> and <HI>Sumack Berries,</HI> boil'd, and beat well together; which must also be refresh'd twice a Day, till the Swel∣ling disappears. From the Beginning, let him gird a Belt tight about his Loins, and wear it continually, 'til the Bowels are drawn up to their natural Situation.</P>
<P>Let his <HI>Diet</HI> be cooling, and easy of Digestion; and his constant <HI>Drink,</HI> a <HI>De∣coction</HI> of <HI>Garden-Cresses,</HI> sweeten'd with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Quinces.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to prevent this Disaster, Care must be taken, never to over-strain your
<PB N="50" REF="003843_0026_1002633E18F5EC50"/>
self, use too violent Motion, or fall in such a Manner as to injure your self in those sensible and tender Parts.</P>
<P>THE YAWS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yaws▪</NOTE> or COUNTRY DISTEMPER, is very hard to cure perfectly, especially when grown inveterate. This is the high∣est Kind of <HI>Scurvey;</HI> and the Symptoms of it are, eating Ulcers in the Throat, or Palate, and filthy Sores in other Parts of the Body, having near Resemblance to those of the <HI>Pox.</HI></P>
<P>THIS unclean Disease often yields to Dr. <HI>Papa'</HI>s Remedy; or, at least, may be kept under by it.</P>
<P>TAKE. 1 Ounce of the Bark of <HI>Su∣mac Root,</HI> 1 Ounce of the <HI>inner Bark</HI> of <HI>Pine,</HI> and 2 Ounces of the <HI>inner Bark</HI> of <HI>Spanish Oak;</HI> boil these together in 2 Quarts of <HI>Water,</HI> 'til the <HI>Decoction</HI> be very strong. Of this Liquor drink a full Pint, Milk-warm, and immediately after it, Half a Pint, quite cold; and it will give you a powerful <HI>Vomit.</HI></P>
<P>THE next Morning, take Half a Pint of the same <HI>Drink</HI> warm, and the same Quantity again in the Evening; and con∣tinue so doing, for 6 Weeks, or 2 Months;
<PB N="51" REF="003843_0026_1002633E18F5EC50"/>
only the <HI>Vomit</HI> must be repeated every se∣venth Day. In the mean Time, <HI>gargle</HI> your Throat, and wash all your Sores, and Ulcers with the same warm <HI>Liquor,</HI> which ought to be made fresh every 2 Days. Be∣sides all this, you must chew the <HI>Sumac Root</HI> very often, and swallow the healing <HI>Juice.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY Night, before you go to Rest, take 2 <HI>Pills,</HI> made of <HI>Turpentine, and Deers Dung,</HI> in equal Quantities.</P>
<P>THE Pox may be cured exactly in the same Manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pox.</NOTE> And, because the Symptoms are much the same, it is very probable, the one was a Graft of the other. The pious <HI>Spaniards</HI> catch'd it from their <HI>Negro</HI> Mis∣tresses in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and had the Ho∣nour of propagating it from thence to all the rest of the World.</P>
<P>IN both Cases, confine your self alto∣gether from eating Flesh, from strong Drink, and be very careful of catching Cold.</P>
<P>TO avoid these Misfortunes, eat seldom of fresh Pork, which breeds very gross Hu∣mours; live not too near a Swamp; nor ever venture upon strange Women, espe∣cially upon <HI>Ethiopians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="003843_0027_1002635586722968"/>
ANOTHER woful Case, is, a CAN∣CER, which some despairingly imagine to be incurable; tho', blessed be GOD, there have been some Instances of Success, by the Method hereafter mentioned. In the mean Time, it usually begins with little hard Lumps, or Swellings, in the Breast, Lip, or other glandulous Part of the Body. These afterwards break into painful Sores, which eat farther and farther, 'til at last, they reach some large Vessel, or mortal Part.</P>
<P>IN this Case, the Patient must submit, in the first Place, to have the hard Lump cut clean out, so soon as he is convinc'd it is a <HI>Cancer.</HI> And, for curing the Wound, he can't do better than make Use of the following <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsam:</HI> He must boil 6 Ounces of <HI>Sassafras Root,</HI> and as much <HI>Dogwood Root,</HI> in a <HI>Gallon</HI> of <HI>Water,</HI> 'til it be wast∣ed to a <HI>Pint,</HI> and having strain'd it off, must drench a <HI>Pledget</HI> therein, and apply it warm to the Sore, renewing it every Day: And if he will have the Patience to continue this for some Time, I can assure him, he will not be the first that has been blest with Success.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="003843_0027_1002635586722968"/>
LET him drink <HI>Sassafras Tea</HI> every Morning, live temperately, upon light and innocent Food; and abstain intirely from strong Liquor.</P>
<P>THE Way to prevent this Calamity, is, to be very sparing in eating Pork, to forbear all salt, and high season'd Meats, and live chiefly upon the Garden, the Or∣chard, and the Hen-house.</P>
<P>I SHALL close this black List of Diseases with the GOUY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gouy.</NOTE> which I observe with Pleasure, to be grown less frequent in the Country, than in the Time of our Fa∣thers. It makes it self known with a Ven∣geance, by a painful Inflammation in some of the Joints; especially of the Hands and Feet.</P>
<P>IT would be great Presumption, after so many vain Attempts, for me to recom∣mend any other Remedy for this obstinate Distemper, than a strict and severe Tempe∣rance, both in Eating, and Drinking. Ne∣vertheless, I am not so hard-hearted, as to deny my Patient any Kind of fresh and plain Food, that agrees with his Stomach: All I intreat of him, is, to confine himself
<PB N="54" REF="003843_0028_10026344198C1D88"/>
religiously to a moderate Quantity. Nor can he do better, than to follow the Ex∣ample of <HI>Cornaro,</HI> a noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> who tied himself down to 12 Ounces of Eata∣bles, including Bread, and 14 Ounces of Drink, in the 24 Hours. He stuck close to this short Allowance, using moderate Exercise; and, from being a Cripple by the <HI>Gout,</HI> recovered his Health, and his Strength, to a Wonder: And having found so much Benefit by these Rules, pursued them strictly to the End of a very long, and happy Life.</P>
<P>NOR are these Weights so scanty as they may seem to be, to some keen Stomachs; but, upon a fair Trial, they will be sound sufficient, to give Strength to the Body, Chearfulness to the Heart, and Vigour to all the Faculties of the Soul. And, besides these happy Effects, they will do more: They will place you above the Influence of the Stars; and make you able to subdue your Pas sions, to the Empire of a cool, and unclouded Understanding.</P>
<P>THE same Temperance that cures this Distemper, will certainly not fail to pre∣vent it; make you live a great while, and very easy while you do live.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="003843_0028_10026344198C1D88"/>
THUS I have run through most of the common Complaints, to which the inhabi∣tants of this Colony are subject; and pre∣scrib'd such innocent Cures, as will generally succeed, if timely made Use of; yet am far from pretending, that any of them are in∣fallible: We all know, that <HI>Death</HI> strikes so home in some Cases, that all <HI>Physick</HI> will be vain. There are many Instances too, where the Diseases of our Climate have a little <HI>Dash</HI> of the <HI>Pox,</HI> the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> or the <HI>Gout;</HI> and then they need a <HI>RATCLIFF,</HI> or a <HI>FRIEND,</HI> to get the better of them.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, it may seem strange, that, among the Remedies I have prescrib'd, no Mention is made of <HI>Mercury, Opium,</HI> or the <HI>Peruvian Bark,</HI> which have almost obtain'd the Reputation of <HI>Specificks.</HI> I acknowledge the powerful Effects of these Medicines; but am perswaded, they ought to be administred with the greatest Skill, and Discernment. And, as I write only for the Service of the Poor, who are wholly left to judge for themselves, I was fearful of putting such dangerous Weapons into their Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="003843_0029_10026360C3175608"/>
IF those of better Circumstances find any Thing here, that may in any Manner deserve their Attention, I should be exceed∣ingly glad: Tho' I own, these Directions were not designed for such as are in Con∣dition to purchase more <HI>learned Advice.</HI> It was only to those whom Fortune has pla∣ced below the Regard of our <HI>Doctors,</HI> that I address this short Essay: And if one sin∣gle Person shall be recovered thereby, or receive the least Relief, I shall account my Pains happily bestow'd.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, there is no Ques∣tion, but some of my <HI>Brother Quacks</HI> will make themselves merry with these Prescrip∣tions. Let them shoot their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>armle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Bolts.</HI> I by no means envy those Gentlemen the only Way they have of appearing wiser than their Neighbours. Tho' after all, it is not impossible, but they may do by some of these, just as the good People of <HI>England</HI> do by the <HI>French</HI> Fashions, <HI>laugh</HI> at them first, and then have the Humility to <HI>follow</HI> them.</P>
