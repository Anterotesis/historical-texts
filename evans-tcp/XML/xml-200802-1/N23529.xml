<HEAD>TO HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the amiable cha∣racter I have heard of you, both in this country (where I have resided many years in the various spheres of life) and in Eu∣rope, I am induced to dedicate to you this publication.</P>
<P>When I last returned to this country, I did myself the honor to wait upon your Excellency, in September, 1796, before your resignation of the Presidency of the United States, and presented to you a Poem I composed upon the <HI>"Rural and Romantic Scenes of</HI> DOWN HILL," near Colerain, Ireland, the seat of the Earl of Bristol, and Bishop of the Diocese of Lon∣donderry—for a copy of which, many of the gentlemen of that country gave me a guinea.</P>
<P>Your Excellency was so humane and condescending, as to countenance my in∣tention
<PB N="IV" REF="031170_0003_0FEAE54AEF161B90"/>
of publishing by subscription, a Poem, suited to the then present state of America, for which I obtained above 1200 subscribers. And your Excellency's con∣descending and polite letter, for transmit∣ting a Poem to you at Mount Vernon, merits By most sincere gratitude.</P>
<P>The Book now published may be use∣ful to all descriptions of both sexes, as the times are indeed alarming, and the art of contentment rendered an essential study of mankind, in pursuit of <HI>real happiness.</HI></P>
<P>I should have done myself the pleasure of waiting on your Excellency, for liberty of addressing the following Treatise to your patronage, but an indisposition, and fear of transgressing on your delicacy pre∣vented—As it is only to gentlemen of superior rank and noted abilities, we can look for literary encouragement in any country for promoting learning and sci∣ence. May every encourager of this work join me in fervent prayer to Hea∣ven, that every real felicity may ever await your Excellency.</P>
<P>I have the honor to subscribe myself, with the most profound respect and gra∣titude, Sir, Your Excellency's most de∣voted, and obedient humble Servant,</P>

<HEAD>THE Author's Address.</HEAD>
<P>A PREFACE, <HI>or Introduction to a book, is generally looked for, as also some account of the Author's life character, &amp;c.—but, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a more matter of form, and of little conse∣quence to the public, I shall limit myself in that respect, trusting, that the production alone, will be a sufficient recommendation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I was born in the North of Ireland, of an English family, and educated in the western part of that kingdom, chiefly in the city of Cork, by two of my uncles, clergymen of the Church of England, and early were abroad an apprentice to a merchant in the Island of Tortola, in the West-Indies; but not enjoying my health there, returned to Ireland, and from thence at an early period of my life came over to America, where I remained about twenty-six years, in various spheres of life; married reputably in the city of Philadelphia, and after the decease of my wife, I returned
<PB N="vi" REF="031170_0005_0FEB133F269EFA68"/>
to Ireland, where I was master of some con∣siderable schools of academics, but returned again to America <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1776, on some business, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/> and descriptive, which were well received, and handsomely enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>aged by several gentle∣men of respectability in that country:—and in 1797, published a book of Poems, for which I was equally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The prose part of the " ART OF CONTENT∣MENT," is chiefly selected from the first Eu∣ropean writers▪ Several of the pieces (those descriptive of America particularly) are my own, with the Acrostic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> President: when I quote from another a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>or, generally give credit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indeed are alarming; and if ever composure to the dispensations of Heaven were necessary it will in all probability be so▪ when the cloud bursts that hangs over the Land.</HI>—Contentment <HI>can only make it sup∣portable.</HI> St. Paul <HI>says,</HI> he had learnt con∣tentment: <HI>so it is to be learned, and not im∣mediately obtained, as some other blessings are.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE ART of CONTENTMENT.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the necessary Connection between Happi∣ness and Contentment.</HEAD>
<P>GOD, who is essentially happy in him∣self, can receive no accession to his felicity by the poor contributions of men. He cannot therefore be supposed to have made them upon intuition of increasing, but communicating his happiness. And this his original design is very visible in all the parts of his Oeconomy towards them. When lapsed man had counterplotted a∣gainst himself, defeated the purpose of the Divine goodness, and plunged his whole nature into the opposite state of endless mi∣sery: he yet reinforced his first design, and by an expedient as full of wonder as mercy, the death of his Son, recovers him
<PB N="8" REF="031170_0007_0FEB13452BF51128"/>
to his former capacity of bliss. And that it might not only be a bare capacity, he has added all other methods proper to work upon a rational creature. He has shewn him his danger, set before him in perspective that eternal Tophet, which he is advised to shun. On the other side, he has no less lively described the heaven∣ly Jerusalem, the celestial Country to which he is to aspire: Nay farther, has levelled his road to it, leads him, not as he did the Israelites through the wilder∣ness, through intricate mazes to puzzle his understanding; through <HI>a land of drought, wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions,</HI> Deut. viii. 15. to discourage and affright him, but has in the Gospel chalked out a plain, a safe, nay a pleasant path. as much superior both in the ease of the way, and in the end to which it leads, as Heaven is to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anaan.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By doing this, he has not only se∣cured our grand and ultimate happiness, but provided for our intermedial also.</P>
<P>Those Christian duties which are to car∣ry us to heaven, are our refreshment, our viaticum in our journey; his yoke is not to gall and fret us, but an engine by which we may with ease (and almost insensibly) draw all the clogs and incumbrances of
<PB N="9" REF="031170_0008_0FEB13491DF8D230"/>
human life. For whether we take Chris∣tianity in its whole complex, or in its se∣veral and distinct branches, 'tis certainly the most excellent, the most compendious art of happy living: Its very tasks are re∣wards, and its precepts are nothing but a divine sort of alchymy, to sublime at once our nature and our pleasures.</P>
<P N="3">3. This may be evidenced in every par∣ticular of the evangelical law: But having formerly made some attempt towards it in another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Decay of Christian Piety.</NOTE>tract, I shall not here reassume the whole subject. I shall only single out one particular precept, wherein happiness is not (as the others) only implied, and must be catched at the rebound by conse∣quence and event; but in literally exprest, and is the very matter of the duty; I mean the precepts of acquiescence and <HI>Content∣ment:</HI> Happiness and this true genuine Contentment, being terms so convertible, that to bid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be content, is but another phrase for bidding us be happy.</P>
<P N="4">4. Temporal enjoyments, such as are pleasure, wealth, honor, and the rest, tho' they make spacious pretences to the mea∣sure of human happiness, are all of them justly discarded by the Philosopher in his
<PB N="10" REF="031170_0009_0FEB134AC3EFB890"/>
Ethicks, upon this one consideration, that coming from abroad they may be withheld or taken from us: And our tenure being precarious we even for that reason are unhappy in our most desirable possessions; because we still are liable to be so. And therefore he concludes, that felicity must be pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the mind and soul; which stands without the reach of fortune: and in the practice of virtue, which in its own nature, and not in its contingent use, is truly good, and therefore certainly ren∣ders the possessors such.</P>
<P N="5">5. But this practice being diffused thro' the whole extent of moral duty. <HI>Epictetim</HI> thought he had deserved w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of human nature, when he drew it up in two short words, to <HI>sustain</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> That is, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear with constancy adverse events, and with moderation en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y those that are pros∣perous. Which complexu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of philoso∣phy is yet more fully, as well as more compendiouslly expressed in the single mo∣tion of <HI>Contentment:</HI> Which involves the patient bearing of all misadventures, and generous contempt of sensual illectives. This state of mind the Greeks express by calling its self-sufficiency, which, we know, properly speaking, is one of the incommu∣nicable attributes of the divine nature, and the Stoicks expressly pretend, that by it
<PB N="11" REF="031170_0010_0FEB134EB5A3DB78"/>
mortal men are enabled to rival their gods; in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> phrase, to make a controversy with <HI>Jupiter</HI> himself. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the in∣solent blasphemy of all independent felici∣ty, christianity acknowledges a material truth in the assertion: And St. <HI>Paul</HI> de∣clares of himself, that <HI>having learnt how to want and how to abound, and in whatever state he happens to be in, therewith to be con∣tent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he is able to do all things through Christ that strengthens him Phil. iv. 11, 12, 13. And having nothing to possess all things,</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 10.</P>
<P N="6">6. Which great event comet about not only because all good things are eminent∣ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the divine nature, and he who by virtue and religion possesses Him, thereby is a full equivalence has every thing; but also upon human measures, and principles of philosophy. The compensations address to wealth, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rightly observed, being not to increase possessions, but lessen de∣sires. And if so it will follow, that the contented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an must be abundantly pro∣vided for, being so entirely satisfied with what he has, as to have no desires at all. Indeed 'tis truly said of covetous men, and is equally verified of all who have any de∣sire to gratify that they want no less what they have than what they have not; but the reverse of that paradox is really made
<PB N="12" REF="031170_0011_0FEB13505FCBF420"/>
good by <HI>Contentment,</HI> which bestows on men the enjoyment of whatever they have, and also whatever they have not; and by teaching to want nothing, abundantly se∣cures not to want happiness.</P>
<P N="7">7. On the other side, this one grace being absent, it is not in the power of any success or affluence to make life a tolera∣ble thing. Let all the materials of earthly happiness be amast together, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lung up∣on one man, they will without Content∣ment be but like the fatal prize of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> treason, who was prest to death with the weight of her booty. He that has the ele∣ments of felicity, and yet cannot form them into satisfaction; is more desperate∣ly miserable than he that wants them: For he who wants them has yet something to hope for, and thinks if he had them he might be happy; but he who insignificant∣ly possesses them, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, has not so much as the flattery of an expectation; for he has nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to desire, and yet can be as little said to enjoy.</P>
<P N="8">8. He therefore that would have the ex∣tract, the quintessence of happiness, must seek it in Content. All outward accessi∣ons are but the dross and earthly part: this alone is the spirit, which when 'tis once separated, depends not upon the fate
<PB N="13" REF="031170_0012_0FEB135459EACFB8"/>
of the other; but preserves its vigor when that is destroyed. St. <HI>Paul,</HI> whom I before mentioned, is a ready instance of it, who professes to be <HI>content in whatever state:</HI> Contentment being not so inseparately linked to eternal things, but that they may subsist apart. That those are often with∣out it we are too sure, and that it may be without them is as certainly true; though by our own default we have not so many examples of it. A heart that rightly com∣putes the difference between temporals and eternals, may resolve with the prophet, <HI>Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vides; the labor of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>live shall fall, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall he no herd in the stalks; yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation,</HI> Hab. iii. 17, 18. He that has God need not much deplore the want of any thing else: Nor can he that considers the plenty and glory of his future state, be much dejected with the want or abjectness of his present.</P>
<P N="9">9. Yet so indulgent is God to our infir∣mities, that knowing how unapt our impa∣tient natures are to <HI>walk</HI> only <HI>by faith, and not at all by sight,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cor. v. 7. he is pleased to give us fair antepasts of satisfaction here, dispenses his temporal blessings, tho'
<PB N="14" REF="031170_0013_0FEB13560142C100"/>
not equally, yet so universally, that he that has least, has enough to oblige not only his acquiescence, but his thankfulness. Though every man has not all his wishes, yet he has that which is more valuable than that he complains to want: nay which he himself could worse spare were it put to his option.</P>
<P N="10">10. And now from such a disposure of things, who would not expect that man∣kind should be the cheerfullest part of the creation? that the <HI>sun should</HI> not more <HI>re∣joice to run his course,</HI> Psal. xix. 5. than man should to finish his: That a journey which has so blessed an end, and such good accommodation by the way, should be passed with all imaginable alacrity, and that we should live here practicers and learners of the state of unmixed, intermi∣nable joys, to which we aspire. But alas, if we look upon the universality of men, we shall find it nothing so, but while all other creatures gladsomely follow the order of their creation, take pleasure in those things God has assigned for them, we with a sul∣len perverseness quarrel at what we should enjoy, and in every thing make it our bu∣siness, not to fit it for our use, but to find out some concealed quality which may render it unfit. We look insidiously upon our blessings, like men that designed only
<PB N="15" REF="031170_0014_0FEB1357A50CC590"/>
to pick a quarrel, and start a pretence for mutining. From hence it is that man who was designed the lord of the world, to whose satisfaction all inferior beings were to contribute, is now the unhappiest of the creatures: Nay as if the whole order of the universe were inverted, he becomes slave to his own vassals, courts all these lit∣tle sublunary things with such passion, that if they prove coy and fly his embraces, he is mad and desperate; if they fling them∣selves into his arms, he is then glutted and satiated; like Amnon, <HI>he hates more than he loved,</HI> 2 Sam. xiii. 15. and is sicker of his possession, than he was of his desire.</P>
<P N="11">11. And thus will it ever he, till we can keep our desires more at home, and not suffer them to ramble after things with∣out our reach. That honest Roman, who from his extraordinary industry upon his little spot of ground, received such an in∣crease, as brought him under suspicion of witchcraft, is a good example for us. God has placed none of us in so barren a soil, in so forlorn a state, but there is some∣thing in it which may afford us comfort; let us husband that to the utmost, and it is scarce imaginable what improvement, even he that appears the most miserable, may make of his condition. But if in a sullen humour we will not cultivate our own
<PB N="16" REF="031170_0015_0FEB135B9E23AED8"/>
field, because we have perhaps more mind to our neighbors, we may thank ourselves if we starve. The despising of what God has already given us, is sure but cold in∣vitation to farther bounty. Men are in∣deed forced sometimes to reward the mu∣tinous; but God is not so to be attacked, nor is it that sort of violence which can e∣ver force heaven. The Heathen could say, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> sent his plagues among the poorer sort of men, because they were always repining: And indeed there is so much of truth in the observation, that our impatience and discontent at our present condition, is the greatest provocation to God to make it worse.</P>
<P N="12">12. It must therefore be resolved to be very contrary to our interest, and surely it is no less to our duty. It is so if we do but own ourselves men, for in that is im∣plied a subordination and submission to that power which has made us so; and to dispute his management of the world, to make other distributions of it than what he has done, is to renounce our subjection, and set up for dominion. But this is yet more intolerable as we are christians, it be∣ing a special part of the evangelical disci∣pline, cheerfully to conform to any condi∣tion; <HI>know how to be abased, and how to abound, to be full, and to be hungry,</HI> Phil.
<PB N="17" REF="031170_0016_0FEB135F98E89640"/>
iv. 12. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> careful for nothing,</HI> ver. 6. Nay, so little does Christ give countenance to our peevish discontents, our wanton outcries when we are not hurt, that he requires more than a contentment, an ex∣ultancy and transport of joy under the heaviest pressures, under reproaches and persecutions. <HI>Rejoice ye in that day, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for joy,</HI> Luke vi. 23. And sure no∣thing can be more contrary to this, than to be always whining and complaining, crying in the Prophet's phrase, <HI>My lean∣ness, my leanness, woe is me,</HI> Isa. xxiv. 16. when perhaps <HI>Moses'</HI> simile does better fit our state. <HI>Jesurun waxed fat and kicked,</HI> Deut. xxxii. 15.</P>
<P N="13">13. And as this queruious humour is against our interest and duty, so is it visi∣bly against our ease. It is a sickness of the mind, a perpetual knawing and craving of the appetite, without any possibility of satisfaction; and indeed is the same in the heart which the <HI>Caninus appet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus</HI> is in the stomach: to which we may aptly enough apply that description we find in the pro∣phet, <HI>He shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry, and he shall eat on the left and not be satisfied,</HI> Isa. ix. 20. Where this sharp, this fretting humour abounds, no∣thing converts into nourishment: Every new accession does but excite some new
<PB N="18" REF="031170_0017_0FEB13613AD0E668"/>
desire; and as 'tis observed of a trencher-fed dog, that he tastes not one bit for the greedy expectation of the next; so a dis∣contented mind is so intent upon his pur∣suits, that he has no relish of his acquest. So that what the prophet speaks of the co∣vetous, is equally applicable to all other sorts of mal-contents; <HI>He enlarges his de∣sire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied,</HI> Hab. ii. 5. And sure if the <HI>de∣sire accomplished</HI> be, as <HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>sweet to the soul,</HI> Prov. xiii. 19. it must be exceed∣ingly bitter, to be thus condemned to end∣less unaccomplished desires; and yet this is the torture which every repining un∣contented spirit provides for itself.</P>
<P N="14">14. What a madness is it then for men to be so desperately bent against their in∣terest and duty, as to renounce even their case too for company? One would think this age were sensual enough to be at de∣fiance with the least shadow of uneasiness. It is so I am sure where it ought not, eve∣ry thing is laborious when it is in compli∣ance with their duty: A few minutes spent in prayer, <HI>Oh what a weariness is it!</HI> Mal ii. 13. If they chance but to miss a meal, they are ready to cry out, their <HI>knees are weak through fasting,</HI> Psal, cix. 24. yet they can without regret, or any self com∣passion, macerate and cruciate themselves
<PB N="19" REF="031170_0018_0FEB13640F220600"/>
with anxious cares and vexations, and as the apostle speaks, 1 Tim. vi. 10, <HI>Pierce themselves through with many sor∣rows.</HI> That proposal therefore which was very rashly made by St. <HI>Peter</HI> to our Savi∣our, <HI>Master, pity▪ thyself,</HI> Mat. xvi. 22. which we render <HI>he it far from thee,</HI> would here be an advised motion to the genera∣lity of mankind, who are commonly made unhappy, not by any thing without them, but by the restless impatience hat is with∣in them.</P>
<P N="15">15. It may therefore be a seasonable of∣fice to endeavor the appeasing those storms, by recalling them to these sober rational considerations, which may shew as well the folly, as uneasiness of this re∣pining unsatisfiable humour. It is cer∣tain that in true reasoning we can find no∣thing whereon to found it, but a great deal to enforce the contrary. Indeed it is so much against the dictate of reasona∣ble nature to affect damage, sin, and tor∣ment, that were there nothing else to be said, but what I have already mentioned. it might competently discover the great unreasonableness of this sin.</P>
<P N="16">16. But we need not confine our ap∣peal to reason, as it is only a judge of uti∣lity and advantage: but enlarge it to ano∣ther
<PB N="20" REF="031170_0019_0FEB13671FD60640"/>
notion, as it is judge of equity and right: in which respect also it gives a clear and peremptory sentence against all mur∣muring impatience. To evince this, I shall insist upon these particulars. <HI>First,</HI> That God is debtor to man, and there∣fore whatever he affords to any, it is upon bounty, not of right, a benevolence not a due. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That this bounty is not strait or narrow, confined to some few particular persons, and wholly over-skip∣ping the rest, but more or less universal∣ly diffused to all. So that he who has the least, cannot justly say but he has been liberally dealt with. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That if we compare our blessings with our allays, our good things with our evil, we will find our good far surmounting. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> That we shall find them yet more so, if we compare them with the good we have done; as on the contrary, we shall find our afflictions scarce discernable if balan∣ced with our sins. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> That as God is rector of the universe, so it appertains to him to make such allotments, such distributions as may best preserve the state of the whole, <HI>Sixthly,</HI> That God not∣withstanding that universal care, has al∣so a peculiar aspect on every particular person, and disposes to him what he dis∣cerns best for him in special. <HI>Seventhly,</HI> If we compare our adversities with those
<PB N="21" REF="031170_0020_0FEB136B157EA3C8"/>
of other men, we shall always find some∣thing that equals, if nnot exceeds our own. All these are certain irrefragable truths, and there is none of them single, but may, if well prest upon the mind, charm it into a calmness and resignation; but when there is such a conspiration of arguments, it must be a very obstinate perverseness that can resist them: Or should they sail to enforce a full convicti∣on, will yet introduce those subsidiary proofs, which I have to alledge, so ad∣vantageously, as will, being put altogether, amount unto perfect and uncontrollable evidence.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of God's Absolute Sovereignty.</HEAD>
<P>THE first proposition that God is deb∣tor to no man, is too clear and apparent to require much of illustration: For as he is a free agent, and may act as he pleases, so he is the sole proprietary, and can wrongfully detain from none, because all original right is in himself. This has been so much acknowledged by the blindest hea∣thens, that none of them durst make inso∣lent addresses to their gods, challenge any thing of them as of debt, but by sacrifices and prayers owned their dependance and wants, and implored supplies. And sure, christianity teaches us not to be more sau∣cy. If those deities who owed their very being to their votaries, were yet acknow∣ledged to be the spring and source of all, we can with no pretence deny it to that suprense power, in <HI>whom we live, move, and have our being,</HI> Acts xvii. 28. For if it were merely an act of his choice to give us a being, all his subsequent bounties can have no other original than his own good pleasure. We could put no obligation upon God before we were; and when we began to be, we were his creatures, and so by the most indisputable right owe our∣selves to him, but can have no antecedent
<PB N="23" REF="031170_0022_0FEB136F8E351D90"/>
title on which to claim any thing from him: So that the apostle might well make the challenge which he doth on God's be∣half, <HI>Who hath given any thing unto him, and it shall be recompenced to him again?</HI> Rom. xi. 35.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now ordinary discretion teaches us, not to be too bold in our expectation from one to whom we can plead no right. It has as little of prudence as modesty, to press impudently upon the bounty of a patron, and does but give him temptation (at least pretence) to deny. And if it be thus with men, who possibly may some∣times have an interest, sometimes a vanity to oblige: it must be much more so to∣wards God, who cannot be in want of us, and therefore need not buy us: <HI>Our good,</HI> as the Psalmist speaks, <HI>extends not to him,</HI> Psal. xvi. 2. He has fundamental right in that little we are, which will stand good tho' it should never be cor∣roborated by greater benefits. With what an humble bashfulness should we then sue for any thing, who have no ar∣gument to invite the least donation, be∣ing already so pre-engaged, that we can∣not mortgage so much as ourselves in con∣sideration of any new favor? And surely, extravagant hopes do very ill befit people in this condition. We see the modesty
<PB N="24" REF="031170_0023_0FEB1372623F1318"/>
of good <HI>Mephibosheth,</HI> tho' he was by a slanderous accusation outed of half the es∣tate <HI>David</HI> given him, yet upon a re∣flection that he derived it all from his good pleasure, disputed not the sentence, but cheerfully resigned to the same disposure, from which he received it, saying, <HI>Yea, let him take all,</HI> 2 Sam, xix. 30. A rare example, and fit for imitation, as being adapted to the present case, not only in that one circumstance of his having re∣ceived all from the king, but also in that of the attainder of his blood: which he confesses in the former part of the 28th verse, <HI>For all of my father's house were but dead men before my Lord.</HI> And alas! may we not say the very same? Was not our whole race tainted in our first parent? So that if God had not the primary title of vassalage, he would in our fall have ac∣quired that of confiscation and escheat. And can we think ourselves then in terms to capitulate, and make our own conditi∣ons, and expect God should humour us in all our wild demands?</P>
<P N="3">3. This is indeed to keep up that old rebellion of our progenitor, for that con∣sisted in a discontent with that portion God had assigned him, and coveting what he had restrained him. Nay indeed it comes up to the height of the devil's proposal,
<PB N="25" REF="031170_0024_0FEB1376561267E8"/>
the attempting <HI>to be as God,</HI> Gen. iii. 5. For 'tis an endeavor to wrest the manage∣ment out of his hands, to supercede his authority of dispensing to us, and to carve for ourselves. This is so mad an inso∣lence, that were it posible to state a case exactly parallel between man and man, it would raise the indignation of any that but pretended to ingenuity. Yet this is, without hyperbole, the true meaning of every murmuring repining thought we entertain.</P>
<P N="4">4. But as bad as it is, who is there of us, that can in this particular say, <HI>We have made our hearts clean?</HI> Prov. xx. 9. 'Tis true we make some formal acknow∣ledgment sometimes that we receive all from God's gift: Custom teaches us from our infancy, after every meal we eat, to give him thanks (though even that is now thought too much respect, and begins to be discarded as unfashionable:) yet sure he cannot be thought to do that in earnest, that has all the time of his eat∣ing been grumbling that his table abounds not with such delicacies as his neigbors. And yet at this rate God knows are most of our thanskgivings. Indeed we have not so much ordinary civility to God, as we have to men. The common proverb
<PB N="26" REF="031170_0025_0FEB1377F8DBF050"/>
teaches us, not to pry too curiously into the blemishes of what is given us; but on God's gifts we fit as censors, nicely exa∣mine every thing which is in any way dis∣agreeable to our fancies, and as if we dealt with him under the notion of chapmen, disparage it, as <HI>Solomon</HI> says, buyers use to do, <HI>It is naught, it is naught saith the buy∣er,</HI> Prov. xx. 14. Nay we seem yet more absurdly to change the scene, and as if God were to make oblations to us, we as critically observe the detects of his bene∣factions, as the Levitical priests were to do those of the sacrifice, and (like angry Dei∣ties) scornfully reject, whatever does not perfectly answer our wanton appetites.</P>
<P N="5">5. And now, should God take us at our words, withdraw all those blessings which we so fastidiously despise, what a condition were we in? Tis sure we have nothing to plead in reverse of that Judgment. There is nothing in it against justice; for he takes but his own. This he intimates to Isreal, Hos. ii. 9. <HI>I will return and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax;</HI> In which he asserts his own property, <HI>My corn, my wine,</HI> &amp;c. and recalls them to the remembrance that they were but usufructuaries. And 'tis as evi∣dent that our tenure is but the same. Nay this proceeding would not be repugnant
<PB N="27" REF="031170_0026_0FEB137AC6CE0508"/>
even to mercy, for even that is not obliged still to prostitute itself to our contempt. I am sure such a toleration is beyond all the measures of human lenity. Should any of us offer an alms to an indigent wretch, and he when he sees 'tis silver, should murmur and exclaim that it is not gold, would we not draw back our hand, and reserve our charity for a more worthy object? 'Tis true indeed, God's thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor our narrow bowels equal measures for the devine com∣passion; and we experimentally find that his long-suffering infinitely exceeds ours; yet we know he does in the parable of the lord and the servant, <HI>Matt. xxviii.</HI> declare, that he will proportion his mercy by ours, in that instance; and we have no promise that he will not do it in this; nay we have all reason to expect he should: For since his wisdom prompts him to do nothing in vain, and all his bounty to us is designed to make us happy, when he sees that end utterly frustrated by our discontents, to what purpose should he continue that to which we will be never the better for?</P>
<P N="6">6. Besides tho' he be exceedingly pa∣tient, yet he is not negligent or insensible; he takes particular notice, not only with what diligence we employ, but with what affections we resent every of his blessings.
<PB N="28" REF="031170_0027_0FEB137D9549A948"/>
And as ingratitude is a voice odious to man so it is extremely provoking to God; so that in this sense also, the words of our Sa∣viour are most true, <HI>From him that hath not (i. e.)</HI> that hath not a grateful sense and value, <HI>shall be taken away even that he hath</HI> Mat. xxv. 29. But we may find a threat∣ning of this kind, more express to Isreal. <HI>Because thou servedst not the Lord thy God with gladness, and with joyfulness of heart, for the abundance of all things, there∣fore shall thou serve thine enemies, whom the Lord God will send among thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things,</HI> Deut. xxviii. 27. A sad and dismal inversion, yet founded wholly in the want of that cheerful recognition which God expected from them. And if Israel, the lot of his inheritance, that people whom he had singled out from all the nations of the world, could thus for∣feit his favor by unthankfulness, sure none of us can suppose we have any surer entail of it. In a word, as God loves a cheerful giver, so he also loves a cheer∣ful receiver; one that complies with his end in bestowing, by taking a just com∣placence in his gifts. But the querulous and unsatisfied, reproach his bounty; ac∣cuse him of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illiberality and narrowness of mind. So that he seems even in his ho∣nor engaged to bring them to a righter
<PB N="29" REF="031170_0028_0FEB1380654FFC98"/>
apprehension of him, and by a deprivati∣on teach them the value of those good things which they could not learn by the enjoyment.</P>
<P N="7">7. If therefore ingenuity and gratitude cannot, yet at least let prudence and self-love engage us against this sin of <HI>Murmur∣ing,</HI> which we see does abundantly justify the character the wise man gives, when he tells us, '<HI>tis unprofitable,</HI> Wisd. i. 11, he might have said pernicious also; for so it evidently is in it's effects. Let us then arm ourselves against it, and to that purpose impress deeply upon our minds the present consideration. That God owes us nothing, and that whatever we receive is an alms, and not a tribute. <HI>Diogenes</HI> being asked what wine drank the most pleasant, answered, That which is drank at another's cost. And this cir∣cumstance we can never miss of to re∣commend our good things to us: For be they little or much, they come <HI>gratis.</HI> When therefore in a pettish mood we find ourselves apt to charge God foolishly, and to think him strait-handed towards us, let us imagine we hear God expostulating with us, as the housholder in the parable, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riend I do thee no wrong: is it not lawful fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me to do what I will with my own?</HI> Mat.
<PB N="30" REF="031170_0029_0FEB13845E7CDAF8"/>
xx. 15. If God have not the right of dis∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing, let us find out those that have, and see how much better we shall speed: But if he hath let us take heed of disputing with him: We that subsist merely by his favor, had need court and cherish it by all the arts of humble observance. Every man is ready to say how ill beggary and pride do agree. The first qualification we cannot put off. O let us not provide it of the other so inconvenient, so odious an adjunct. Let us leave off prescribing to God (which no ingenious man would do to an earthly benefactor) and set us betake ourselves to a more holy and successful policy, the acknowledgment of past mercies, and our own unworthiness. This was <HI>Jacob's</HI> method, <HI>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy ser∣vant: for with my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I am become two bands;</HI> and with this humble preface he introduces his petition for rescue in his present distress, <HI>Deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother,</HI> &amp;c. Gen. xxx. 10, 11. An ex∣cellent pattern of divine rhetoric, which the success demonstrates to have been ve∣ry prevalent. And we cannot transcribe better copy, to render our desires as suc∣cessful. Indeed we are so utterly destitute of all arguments from ourselves, that we
<PB N="31" REF="031170_0030_0FEB138611034538"/>
can make no reasonable form of address, if we found it not in something of God; and there is nothing even in him adapted to our purpose, but his mercy: nor can that be so advantageously urged by any thing, as by the former instances it has given of itself: for as God only is fit to be a precedent to himself, so he loves to be so. Thus we find, not only <HI>Moses,</HI> but God often recollecting his miraculous fa∣vors towards <HI>Israel,</HI> as an argument to do more: Let us therefore accost him in his own way, and by a frequent and grateful recounting of his former mercies, engage him to future. Nor need we be at a loss for matter of such recollection, if we will but seriously consider what we have alrea∣dy received, which is the subject of the next section.</P>

<HEAD>Of God's unlimited Beauty.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the kown character of an unworthy nature, to write injuries in marble, and benefits in dust; and however some (as Senaca well observes) may acquit them∣selves of this imputation as to man, yet scarce any do so in relation to God. 'Tis true indeed the charge must be a little va∣ried; for God neither will nor can do us injury: Yet we receive any thing that is adverse with such a resentment as if it were, and engrave that in our memories with indelible characters, whilst his great and real benefits are either not at all ob∣served, or with so transient an advertence, that the comparison of dust is beyond our pitch, and we may be more properly said to write them in water. Nay so far are we from keeping records and registers of his favors, that even those standing and fit ones which sense can prompt us to, (without the aid of our memories) cannot obtain our notice.</P>
<P N="2">2. Were it not thus, it were impossible for men to be so perpetually in the com∣plaining key, as if their voices were capa∣ble of no other sound. One wants this,
<PB N="33" REF="031170_0032_0FEB138D173CD270"/>
and another that, and a third something beyond them both, and so <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> when all this while every one of them en∣joys a multitude of good things without any remark. That very breath where∣with they utter their complaints, is a blessing, and a fundamental one too: for, if God should withdraw that, they were incapable of whatsoever else they either have, or desire. 'Tis true that some men's impatience hath risen so high, as to cast away life, because it was not cloathed with all the circumstances, they wished. Yet these are rare instances, and do only shew such men's depraved judg∣ment of things. A rich jewel is not the less valuable, because a mad man in his raving sit flings it into the fire: But as to the generality of men, the Devil (though a liar) gave a true account of their sense, when he said, <HI>Skin for skin, and that a man hath, will he give for his life,</HI> Job. II. 4. And though perhaps in an angry fit many men have with Jonas, Chap. iv. 3. <HI>wished to die,</HI> yet ten to one, should death then come, they would be as willing to divert it, as was the man in the Apologue, who wearied with his burden of sticks, flung it down and called for death; but when he came, owned no other occasion for him, but to be helped up again with his bundle. I dare in this appeal to the ex∣perience
<PB N="34" REF="031170_0033_0FEB138EB9B6C7C0"/>
of those, who have seemed very weary of life, whether when any sudden danger has surprised them, it has not as suddenly altered their mind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and made them have a greater desire for life, than before they abhorred it. 'Tis the common saying, as long as there is life there is hope: it is so, as to secular concerns, for what strange revolutions do we often see in the age of man? From what despicable beginnings have many ar∣rived to the most splendid conditions? Of which we have divers modern as well as ancient instances.</P>
<P>Indeed 'tis admirable to see what time &amp;c. industry will (with God's blessing) effect. <HI>But there is no work, nor device, nor know∣ledge, nor wisdom in the grave,</HI> EC. ix. 10. we can improve no more when we are once transplanted thither.</P>
<P N="3">3. But this is yet much more consider∣able in respect of our spiritual state. Our life is the <HI>day wherein we are to work,</HI> John ix. (yea to work out Salvation:) but <HI>when the night comes</HI> (when death over∣takes) <HI>no man can work.</HI> Now alas when it is considered how much of this day the most of us have stood idle till the sixth or ninth hour, it will be our concern not to have our day close before the eleventh.
<PB N="35" REF="031170_0034_0FEB1391D269DA18"/>
Nay alas it is yet worse with us: We have not only been idle, but very often ill busi∣ed: so that we have a great part of our time to unravel, and that is not to be done in a moment. For though our works may fitly enough be represented by the Pro∣phet's comparison of a <HI>spider's web,</HI> Isa. lix. 5. yet they want the best property e∣ven of that; they cannot be so soon un∣done. Vices that are radicated by time and custom, lie too deep to be lightly swept away. It is no easy thing to per∣suade ourselves to the will of parting with them. Many violences we must offer to ourselves, a long and strict course of mor∣tification must be gone through, e'er we can find in our hearts to bid them begone: And yet when we do so, they are not so tractible us the Centurions servants. They will indeed come when ever we bid them, but they will scarce go so: they must be expelled by force and by slow degrees; we must sight for every inch of ground we gain from them: And as God would not assist the Israelites to subdue the Canaan∣ites at once, Deut. vii. 22. so neither ordi∣narily does he, us to master perfectly our corruptions. Now a process of this diffi∣culty is not to be dispatched on a sudden. And yet this is not all our task, for we have not only ill habits to extirpate, but we have also good ones to acquire: It is
<PB N="36" REF="031170_0035_0FEB1394C751BBC8"/>
not a mere negative virtue will serve our turns, nor will empty lamps enter us into the marriage-chamber, Mat. xxv. 10. <HI>He must add to our faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, &amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pet. i. 15.</P>
<P N="4">4. And now I would desire the Reader seriously to consider, whether he can upon good grounds tell himself that this so diffi∣cult, (and yet so necessary) a work is ef∣fectually wrought in him. If it be, he is a happy man, and can with no pretence complain of any external want: (he that is fed with Manna, must be strangely per∣verse if he murmur for a belly-full of <HI>leeks and onions,</HI> Num. xi. 15.) But on the con∣trary, he owes infinite thanks to God, that has spared him time for this impor∣tant business, and did not put a period to his natural life, before he had begun a spi∣ritual. For I fear there are among the best of us few of so entire an innocence, but they may remember some, either ha∣bits or acts of fin, in which it would have been dreadful for them to have been snatched away. And then how compre∣hensive, how prolific a mercy has life been to them, when it has carried eternity in its womb, and their continuance on earth has qualified them for heaven? Nei∣ther are such persons only to look on it as
<PB N="37" REF="031170_0036_0FEB1397974590B8"/>
a blessing in the retrospect, as it relates to the past, but also in the present and future; which if they continue to employ well, does not only confirm, but advance their reward. Besides God may please by them to glorify himself, make them in∣strumental to his service; which as it is the greatest honor, so it is also the great∣est satisfaction to a good heart. He shews himself too mercenary that so longs for his reward, as to grow impatient of his attendance: He that loves God, thinks himself blest in the opportunity of doing work, as well as in receiving wages. Thus we see how life is under all these aspects, a mercy to a pious man, and such as not only obliges him to contentment, but gratitude.</P>
<P N="5">5. But supposing a man cannot give this comfortable account of his life, but is conscious that he has spent it to a very different purpose, yet does not that at all lessen his obligations to God, who meant he should have employed it better, and that he has not done so is merely his own fault. Nay indeed the worse his state is, the greater mercy it is, that God has not made it irreversible, that he has not cut him off at once from the earth, and the possibility of Heaven too, but affords him
<PB N="38" REF="031170_0037_0FEB139B8EAC8FB0"/>
yet a longer <HI>day, if yet be will hear his voice,</HI> Psal. xcv. 7. This long-suffering is one of the most transcendant acts of di∣vine goodness, and therefore the Apostle rightly stiles it the <HI>the riches of his goodness, and long suffering, and forbearance,</HI> Rom. ii. 4. And so at last we commonly ac∣knowledge it, when we have worn it out, and can no longer receive advantage by it. What a value does a gasping despairing soul put upon a small parcel of that time, which before he knew not how fast enough to squander? Oh that men would set the same estimate on it before: and then cer∣tainly as it would make them better hus∣bands of it, so it would also render them more thankful for it, <HI>Accounting that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation,</HI> 2. Pet. iii. 15.</P>
<P N="6">6. Indeed did men but rightly com∣pute the benefit of life upon this score, all secular encumbrances and uneasinesses of it would be overwhelmed, and stand only as cyphers in the account. What a shame is it then that we should spend our breath in sighs and out-cries? which if we would employ to those nobler ends for which it was given, would supersede our complaints, and make us confess we were well dealt with: that on <HI>life</HI> (though bare and stripped of all outward accessaries) <HI>is
<PB N="39" REF="031170_0038_0FEB139D45771410"/>
gives us for a prey,</HI> Jer. xlv. 5. And in∣deed he that has yet the great work of life to do, can very ill spare time or sor∣row to bestow upon the regretting any temporal distress, since his whole stock is little enough to bewail and repair his neg∣lects of his eternal concerns. Were our lives therefore destitute of all outward comfort, nay were they nothing but a scene of perpetual disasters, yet this one advantage of life would infinitely out∣weigh them all, and render our murmur∣ing very inexcusable.</P>
<P N="7">7. But God has not put this to the ut∣most trial, has never placed any man in such a state of unmixed calamity, but that he still affords many and great com∣forts: he finds it fit sometimes to diminish some of our outward comforts, and per∣haps imbitter others, but he never takes all way. This must be acknowledged, it we do but consider how many things there are in which the whole race of mankind do in common partake. The four ele∣ments, fire and water, air and earth, do not more make up every man's composi∣tion, that they supply his needs: the whole host of heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, <HI>Moses,</HI> will tell us, are by <HI>God divided to all nations under the whole heaven,</HI> Deut. iv. 19. Those resplendent bodies,
<PB N="40" REF="031170_0039_0FEB13A0552FFEF8"/>
equally afford their light and influence to all. The sun shines as bright on the poor cottage, as on the most magnificent pa∣lace; and the stars have their benign as∣pects, as well for <HI>him that is behind the mill,</HI> as for <HI>him that sitteth on the throne,</HI> Exod. xi. 5. Property (the great incen∣diary below) breeds no confusion in those celestial orbs, but they are every man's treasure, yet no man's peculiar, (as if they meant to teach us, that our love of appropriation <HI>descends not from above,</HI> James iii. 15, is no heavenly quality.)</P>
<P N="8">8. And as they make no distinction of the ranks and degrees of men, so neither do they of their virtues. Our Saviour tells us, God causes <HI>his sun to rise on the just and on the unjust,</HI> Mat. v. 45. If now we descend lower to the sublunary crea∣tures, they equally pay their homage to man, do not disdain the dominion of the poor, and submit to that of the rich, but shew us that their instinct extends to the whole nature. An horse draws the poor man's plough, as tamely as the prince's charriot, and the beggar's hungry cur follows him with as much obsequiosness and affection, as the pampered lap-dogs of the nicest ladies. The sheep obey a poor mercenary shepherd as well as they did the daughter's of the wealthy <HI>Laban,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="031170_0040_0FEB13A44CBA6858"/>
Gen. xxix. 9. or of <HI>Jethro</HI> a prince, <HI>Exod.</HI> ii. 26. and as willingly yield their fleece to clothe <HI>Lazarus,</HI> as to make purple for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> And as animals, so vegetables are as communicative of their qualities to one man as another. The corn nourishes, the fruits refresh, the flowers delight, the simples cure the poor man as well as the rich.</P>
<P N="9">9. But I foresee it will be objected, that these natural privileges are insignificant because they are evacuated by those posi∣tive laws which bound propriety, and that therefore though one man could use the creatures as well as another, yet every man have them not to use. I answer, that for some of the things I have menti∣oned, they are still in their native lati∣tude, cannot be inclosed or monopolized. The most ravenous oppressor could never yet lock up the sun in his chest: <HI>He that lays house to house, and land to land, till there be no place,</HI> Isa. v. 8. cannot inclose the common air; and the like may be said of divers of the rest: So that there are some (and those no mean blessings) which continue still the indefeasible right of man∣kind in general.</P>
<P N="10">10. As for those other things which are liable to the restrictive terms of <HI>meum</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="031170_0041_0FEB13A5ED937330"/>
and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> 'tis not the dispensing them; as great as <HI>Nathan's</HI> parable describes, when he speaks of the numerous flocks of the rich man, and the <HI>single ewe lamb of the poor,</HI> a Sam. xii. 2, yet there is scarce any so deplorably indigent, but by one means or other, he has or may have the necessary supports of life. Perhaps they fall not into his lap by birth-right and in∣heritance, yet they are acquirable by la∣bor and industry, which is perhaps the better tenure. They cannot, it may be, arrive to <HI>Sodom's fulness of bread,</HI> yet if they have not her <HI>abundance of idleness,</HI> Ezek. xvi. 40. they commonly need not want that, which was the height of <HI>Au∣gur's wish, food convenient,</HI> Prov. xxx. 8. 'Tis true indeed, if they will sold their hands in their bosom, if with <HI>Solomon's sluggard, they will not plough by reason of the cold,</HI> they must take his fate in the sum∣mer, as they have his ease in the winter, <HI>they may beg in harvest, and have nothing,</HI> Prov. xx. 4. But then 'tis visible they are the authors of their own necessities. And indeed to men of such lazy careless natures, 'tis hard to say, what degree of God's bounty can keep them from want, since we often see the fairest fortune's dis∣sipated, as well by the supine negligence, as the riotous prodigality of the owners. And therefore if men will be idle, they
<PB N="43" REF="031170_0042_0FEB13A8DF4BAC48"/>
are not to accuse God, but themselves, if they be indigent.</P>
<P N="11">11. But then there is one case wherein men seem more inevitably exposed, and that is, when by age, sickness, or decre∣pidness, they are disabled from work, or when their family is too numerous for their work to maintain. And this indeed seems that most forlorn state of poverty; yet God has provided for them also, by assign∣ing such persons to the care of the rich: Nay, he has put an extraordinary mark of favour on them, given them the honour of being his proxies representatives, made them letters of attorney (as it were) to de∣mand relief in his name, and upon his ac∣count. And though tis too true, that even that authority will not prevail with many of the rich to open their purses, yet even in this age of frozen charity, there are still some who remember upon what terms they received their wealth, and employ it accordingly. And though the number of them is not so great as it were to be wished, yet there are in all parts, some scattered here and there, like <HI>cities of re∣fuge</HI> in the land, Deut. xix. 2. to which these poor distressed creatures may flee for succour. And I think I may say, that between the legal provisions that are made in this case, and voluntary contributions,
<PB N="44" REF="031170_0043_0FEB13ABD420D8E8"/>
there are not very many that want the things that are of absolute necessity: and we know <HI>St. Paul</HI> comprises those in a small compass, <HI>food and raiment,</HI> and pro∣poses them as sufficient materials of con∣tent, 1<HI>Tim. vi. 8.</HI> I say not this, to con∣tract any man's bowels, or lessen his com∣passion for such poor wretches. For how∣muchsoever they lend, I wish as <HI>Joab</HI> did in another case to <HI>David,</HI> the Lord <HI>in∣crease it an hundred fold,</HI> 2 Sam. xxiv. 3. I only urge it as an evidence of the asser∣tion I am to prove, that no man is so pre∣termitted by God, or his disposal of tem∣porals, but that even he that seems the most abandoned, has a share in his provi∣dence, and consequently cannot justly murmur, since even this state which is the highest instance of human indigence, is not without its receivings from God.</P>
<P N="12">12. But the number in this form are but few, compared to those in a higher; for between this and the highest affluence, how many intermediate degrees are there, in which men partake not only of the ne∣cessaries, but comforts of life; that have not only food and raiment, but their dis∣tinction of holy-day and working-day, fare and appaerel? He that is but one step advanced from beggary has so much, he that has got to a second has more than is

necessary; and so every degree rises in plenty till it comes to vanity and excess: And even there too, there are gradual ri∣sings, some having so much fewel for luxury, that they are at as great a loss for invention, as others can be for materials, and complain that there are no further riots left for them to essay. How many are there who have so cloyed and glutted their senses, that they want some other inlets for pleasure, and with the rich ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the gospel, are in distress where to be∣stow their abundance!</P>
<P N="13">13. And sure such as these cannot de∣ny that they have received good things, yet generally there are none less content∣ed; which is a clear demonstration that our repinings proceed not from any de∣fect of bounty in God, but from the ma∣lignant temper of our own hearts. And as it is an easier thing to satisfy the cravings of an hungry, than to curethe nauseous recoilings of a surfeited stomach: so cer∣tainly the discontents of the poor are much easier allayed than those of the rich. The indigence of the one has contracted his desires, and has taught him not to look further than a little beyond bare necessa∣ries, so that a moderate alms satisfies, and a liberal, transports him: But he who by a perpetual repletion has his desires stretch∣ed

and extended, is capable of no such satisfaction. When his enjoyments fore∣stall all particular pursuits, and he knows not upon what to fasten his next wish; yet even then he has some confused, un∣informed appetites, and thinks himself miserable because he cannot tell what would make him more happy. And yet, this is that envied state which men with so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch greediness aspire to. Every man looks on it as the top of felicity, to have nothing more to wish in the world. And yet alas, even that when attained, would be their torment. Let men never think then that contentment is to be caught by long and foreign pursuits; he is likeliest to find it who sits at home, and duly con∣templates those blessings which God has brought within his reach, of which every man has a fair proportion, if he will ad∣vert to it.</P>

For besides these external accessions (of which the meanest have some, the mid∣dle sort a great deal, and the uppermost rather too much) man is a principality within himself, and has in his composure so many excellent impresses of his Mak∣er's power and goodness, that he need not ask leave of any exterior thing to be happy, if he knew but right how to value himself: The very meanest part of him,

Nor are they only for shew, but use; every member, every limb is endowed with a particular faculty to make it serviceable to the whole; and in that admirable con∣texture of veins and arteries, sinews and muscles, nerves and tendons, none are superfluous, but some way or other con∣tribute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vegetation, sense, or motion.

the fate we read of Saul in holy scripture and against his genius and purpose, to be∣come a prophet, breaking frequently out into hymns and sacred raptures, saying, These mysteries are more divine than the <HI>Samothracian</HI> or <HI>Eleusinian;</HI> and confessing they both strictly require, and infinitely excel the low returns of human praise. But beyond the fabric of parts as organic, what an extract of wonder are our senses, those <HI>five operations of the Lord,</HI> as the son of Sirach rightly (and by way of eminence) stiles them <HI>Eccl.</HI> xvii. 5? By these we draw all outward objects to ourselves. What were the beauties of the universe to us, if we had not sight to behold them, or the most melodious sounds, if we had not hearing? and so of the rest. And yet these are not only generally given. but al∣so preserved to the greater part of men; and perhaps would be to more, did not our base undervaluing of common mer∣cies, force God sometimes to instruct us in their worth, by making us feel what it is to want them.</P>
<P N="15">15. Multitudes of refreshments God also has provided for our bodies, particu∣larly that of sleep, of which he has been so considerate, as in his distributions of time, to make a solemn allotment for it: Yet who almost, when he lies down, con∣siders

the mercy, or when he rises refresh∣ed, rises thankful also? But if our rest at any time be interrupted by the cares of our mind, or pains of our bodies, then and on∣ly then, we consider, that is <HI>God who gives his beloved sleep,</HI> Psal. cxxvii. 2. and think it a blessing worth our esteem. Thus it is with health, strength, and every thing else, we despise it while we have it, and impatiently desire it whilst we have it not, but in the mean time sure we cannot complain, that God's hand is shortened towards us, when in the ordinary course of his providence we commonly enjoy these mercies many years, which we find so much want of, if they be withdrawn but for a few hours. And indeed, there is not a greater instance of human corrup∣tion than our senseless contempt of bless∣ings, merely because they are customary; which in true reason is an argument why we should prize them the more. When we deal with men, we discern it well enough, he that gives me once an hun∣dred pounds, I account not so much my benefactor, as if he made it my annual re∣venue; yet God must lose his thanks, by multiplying his favors; and his benefits grow more invisible by their being always before us.</P>
<P N="16">16. But the body (with its enjoyment)
<PB N="50" REF="031170_0049_0FEB13BD16210DE8"/>
is but the lowest instance of God's bounty, 'tis but a decent case for that inestimable jewel he has put in it: The soul, like the ark, is the thing for which this whole tabernacle was framed, and that is a spark of divinity in which alone it is that God accomplished his design of <HI>making man in his own image,</HI> Gen. 1. 26. It would be too long to attempt an exact survey of its particular excellencies. The mere in∣tellectual powers wherewith it is endued, have exercised the curiosity, and raised the admiration of the great contemplations of nature in all ages; yet after all, of so sub∣tile composure is the soul, that it is in∣scratable even to itself: And tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh the simplest man knows he has the faculties of imagination, apprehension, memory, reflection; yet the most learned cannot assign where they are seated, or by what means they operate. It is enough to us that we have them, and many excellent uses for them; one whereof (and a most necessary one) is a thankful reflection on the goodness of God who gave them. He might have made us in the very lowest form of creatures, insensible stocks or stones; or if he had advanced us a step higher, he might have fixed us among mere animals, made us perhaps of the noxious, at best of the tamer sort of beasts; but he has placed us in the highest rank

of visible creatures, and not only given us <HI>dominion over the works of his hands,</HI> Psal. viii. 6. but has given reason wherewith to manage that sovereignty, without which we had only been the more masterly sort of brutes.</P>
<P N="17">17. Yet still the soul is to be consider∣ed in a higher notion, than of its immor∣tality and capacity of endless bliss: And here indeed it owns its extraction, and is an image of the first Being, whose felici∣ty is co-existent with himself; this, as it is the most transcendent accomplishment of nature, so it is most universal. What∣ever disparity there may be between man and man in other respects, yet in this all are equal. The poor beggar at the gate has a soul as capacious of eternal happi∣ness as his whose crumbs he begs for, (nay sometimes better prepared for it, as that parable shews, <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 11.) And tho' the dignities of earth are the prize of the rich and noble, the subtle and designing, yet heaven is as easily mounted from the dunghill as the throne: and an honest simplicity will sooner bring us thither than the Machiavelian policy. Nay God has not only designed us to so glorious an end, but has done all on his part to secure us of it, sent his Son to lead us the way, his Spirit to quicken us in it. We need not

The heathen Philosopher made it matter of his solemn acknowledgment to fortune, that he was born a Grecian and not a Barbarian: And sure the advantages of our Christianity are of a much higher strain, and ought to be infinitely more celebrated. The Apostle we find often applauding this glorious pri∣vilege, as that which makes us <HI>fellow-citi∣zens with the saints, and of the houshold of God,</HI> Ephes. iii. 19. Nay, which elevates us to a higher state, <HI>the adoption of sons,</HI> Gal. iv. 5. Not only sons, but <HI>heirs also with God, and joint heirs of Christ,</HI> Rom. viii. 17.

Cer∣tainly did we but know how to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ourselves upon this account, it were im∣possible for us, with such sordid conde∣scensions, to court every petty worldly in∣terest, and so impatiently vex ourselves when we cannot attain it. Alas! how un∣worthily do we bear the names of Christi∣ans, when that which carried the forefa∣thers of our faith through the most fiery trials, cannot support us under the disap∣pointment of any exrtavagant desire? They had such <HI>respect to the recompence of the re∣ward,</HI> Heb. xi. 26. as made them cheer∣fully expose their fame to ignominy, their goods to rapine, their bodies to the most exquisite tortures, and their lives to death. Yet the same hopes cannot work us to any tolerable degree of patience, when we suffer the smallest diminution of any of these. What shall we say? Is hea∣ven grown less valuable, or earth more than it was then? No surely, but we are more infatuated in our estimates, we have so long abetted the rivalry of the hand∣maid, that the mistress, like <HI>Sarah,</HI> ap∣pears despicable.

Were we in <HI>Job's</HI> conditi∣on, sitting upon a dunghill, and scraping ourselves with a potsheard, yet as long as we can say with him, <HI>Our Redeemer liveth,</HI> Job xix. 25. we have all reason to say with him also, <HI>Blessed be the name of the</HI> LORD, Job, i. 21. What a madness is it then for us to expose ourselves to be pierced and wounded by every temporal adversity, who have so impenetrable an armour? Nay, what an ungrateful reproach is it to that goodness of God, to shew that we can∣not make him a counterpoise to the most trivial secular satisfaction? on which ac∣count sure he may again take up that ex∣probating complaint we find in the Pro∣phet, <HI>A goodly price that I was valued at of them,</HI> Zac. xi. 13.</P>
<P N="19">19. But how mean soever he is in our eyes, though Christ seem the same to us in his glory which he did in his abasement, to have no beauty that we should desire him; yet he puts another rate upon him∣self, and tells us, <HI>That he that loves father or mother, son or daughter, more than me, is not worthy of me,</HI> Matth. x. 37. Now our love and our joy are passions coinci∣dent

abstracting from all the forgotten or neg∣lected favors, what vast catalogues may every man make to himself, if he would but recollect, what effects he has had of God's bounty in giving, of his providence in protecting, of his grace in restraining and exciting of his patience in forbearing? And certainly all these productions of the divine goodness were never designed to die in the birth. The Psalmist will tell us, <HI>The Lord has so done his marvellous works, that they ought to be had in remem∣brance,</HI> Psal. cxi. 3. Let every man then make it his daily care to recount to him∣self the wonders God hath done, as for the children of men in general, so for himself in particular.

<HEAD>Of the Surplusage of our Enjoyments above our Sufferings.</HEAD>
<P>TO regulate our estimate of those things which we either enjoy or suffer, there are three precedent queries to be made: The first of their number of plenty, the second of their weight, the third of their constan∣cy and continuance; for according as they partake more of these properties, every good is more good, and every evil is more evil. It will therefore be our best me∣thod of trial in the present case, to com∣pare our blessings and our calamities in these three respects.</P>
<P N="2">2. And first in part of plenty, the mercies of God are the source of all our good, are set out to us in holy scripture in the most supurlative strain. They are <HI>multitude,</HI> Psal. cii. 20. <HI>Plentious redem∣ption,</HI> Psal. cxxx. 7. <HI>As high as the heaven,</HI> Psal. ciii. 11. <HI>He fills all things living with plenteousness,</HI> Psal. cxlv. 16. His mercies indeed are such as come not within the compass of number, but stretch themselves to infinity; and are best represented by such a calculation as God made to Abraham, when he shewed
<PB N="59" REF="031170_0058_0FEB13D774F7C4C8"/>
him the numerousness of his posterity by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the stars, Gen. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 5. Were there but a single mercy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to each minute of our lives the sum world arise very high; But how is our arithmetic confounded, when every minute has more than we can distinctly number? for besides the original stock mentioned in the last section, and the ac∣cession of new bounty, the giving us some∣what which we had not before; what an accumulative mercy is it, the preserving what we have? we are made up of so ma∣ny pieces, we have such variety of inte∣rests, spiritual, temporal, public and pri∣vate; for ourselves, our friends, and de∣pendants, that it is not a confused general regard that will keep all these in security one moment. We are like a vast build∣ing, which costs as much to maintain as to erect. And indeed considering the cor∣ruptibleness of our materials, our preser∣vation is no less a work of omnipotence, than our first forming: Nay perhaps it is rather a greater. Our original clay though it had no aptness, yet it had no aversion to the receiving a human form; but was in the hand of the potter to make it what he pleased: But we now have principles of decay within us, which vehemently tend to dissolution; we want the supplies of se∣veral things without us, the failing where∣of
<PB N="60" REF="031170_0059_0FEEDECD7A4C31C0"/>
return us again to our dust. Nay we do not only need the aid, but we fear the hostility of outward things. That every air which sometimes refreshes us, may at ano∣ther starve &amp; freeze us; that which warms and comforts, has also a power of consum∣ing us. Yea that very meat which nou∣rishes, may choak and stiflle us. In a word, there is no creature so despicable, so inconsiderable, which may not some∣times serve, and which may not at any time (if God permit) ruin us. Now, whence is it that we so constantly, so fre∣quently find the good, the benign effica∣cy of these things, and so seldom, so rare∣ly the evil? Whence I say is it, but from the active unwearied providence, which draws forth the better properties of the creatures for our use, and restrains the worser for our security? which with a par∣ticular advertence watches not only over e∣very person, but every several con∣cern of that person. And how astonishing a contemplation is this? If the mere eb∣bing and flowing of the sea, put the Phi∣losopher into such an ecstacy, that he flung himself into it, because he could not com∣prehend the inscrutable cause of it; in what perpetual raptures of admiration may we be, who have every minute within us, and about us more and greater wonders, and those too in our favor,

when we deserve rather the divine pow∣er should exert itself into our destruction?</P>
<P N="3">3. But alas! our danger from the visi∣ble creature, is little compared with those from the spirits of darkness. <HI>We wrestle not only with flesh and blood, but with prin∣cipalities and powers, with spiritual wicked∣ness,</HI> &amp;c. Ephes. vi. 12. So inveterate is the enmity between the serpent and the seed of the woman in general, that he watches all advantages against us, not on∣ly in our souls, but even our bodies, our goods, and in every part of our concerns. Thus we see he not only assaulted <HI>Job's</HI> soul, by the wicked insinuations of his wise, (with more effect) his body with boils and sores, his possessions by the <HI>Chal∣deans</HI> and <HI>Sabeans,</HI> and the images of him∣self, his dearest children, by a wind from the wilderness, Job i. And can we think his malice is now worm out? No surely, he still wishes as ill to mankind as ever, and we should soon see the woful effects of it, did not the same power which let loose for <HI>Job's</HI> trial, restrain him for our safety. Nay, had he but power to affright, though not to hurt us, even that would make our lives very uncomfortable. We cannot hear the relation of sprights or apparitions, but our blood chills upon it,

and a horror runs through our reins: What should we then do if he should make his night-walks through our chamber, and with his illusory terrors disturb our rest? Yet all this and much more he would do, if God did not chain up this <HI>old dragon,</HI> Rev. xx. Nay, if he were not at the ex∣pence of a guard about us, and those no less than angels. I shall not dispute whe∣ther every person hath not his peculiar guardian: For though many have not improbably asserted it. we have ground enough of acquiescence in the general af∣firmation of the Apostle. <HI>That they are all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them, who shall be heirs of salvation,</HI> Heb. i. 14. And now if the reader please to sum up how many are his concerns, and how many are the dangers await him in them all, he cannot sure render the ac∣count of those mercies which preserve the one, and divert the other, in any other phrase tahn that of the psalmist, <HI>They are more than I am able to express,</HI> Psal. xi. 5.</P>

We may judge by ourselves which he is likeliest often to repeat, those acts which he doth with re∣gret and reluctancy, or those which he does with pleasure and delight. But we need no inferences where we have the at∣testation of experience. Let every man therefore make this his judge in this case, let him every night recollect, how many things within and about him he is concern∣ed in, and consider how many of those have been preserved entire to him, still accounting every thing so continued as a new donation. If he begin with his Spi∣ritual state, 'tis too possible he may some∣times find he has lost his innocence, com∣mitted some, perhaps many sins: But e∣ven in these he will find cause to justify God, If he do but recollect with what in∣ward checks and admonitions, and out∣ward restraints, God has endeavored to bridle him. If he will break through those fences, that does not at all derogate from the mercy of God which so guarded him, but it rather illustrates his goodness, that after so many quenchings of his spi∣rit,

does yet continue its influence. So that even he that has the most deplorably violated his integrity, is yet to confess that God's purpose was to have preserved it en∣tire; and he might really so have kept it, had he complied with those aids which were afforded him. But in temporal con∣cerns we are not so apt to undermine our∣selves, and therefore shall much more rarely find we have suffered detriment in them, that in our spiritual; but are there ordinarily like to meet with a better ac∣count. Let a man therefore consider what is lacking to him of all the secular good things he had in the morning, and tell me whether for the most part he may not give such an account, as the Israelitish of∣ficers did of their men, after the slaugh∣ter of the <HI>Midinnites, That he hath not lost one,</HI> Numb. xxxi. 39. Or if some∣times he do suffer a diminution, yet at the worst he will find that many more good things have been preserved to him, than have been taken from him. A man may perhaps meet with some damage in his estate, yet 'tis manifold odds that that damage in but partial, and that he has still more left than is lost. Or if it be more entire, yet if he have his health, his limbs, his senses, his friends, and all things beside his estate left him, so that for one thing he has lost, he still retains

a multitude, he may say of it as the disci∣ples of the few loaves, <HI>What is this among so many,</HI> Matth. xiv. 17. <HI>Aristippus</HI> being bemoaned for the lose of a farm, replied with some sharpness upon his condoler, You have but one field, and I have yet three left, why should I not rather grieve for you? Intimating that a man is not so much to estimate what ha has lost, as what he has left. A piece of wisdom which if he would transcribe, we might quickly convince ourselves, that even in our most adverse estate there are as <HI>Elijah</HI> speaks, <HI>More with us than against us,</HI> 2 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings vi. 16. that our enjoyments are more than our sufferings, and God's acts of grace do far out-number those of his severity.</P>
<P N="5">5. And as they do out-number, so al∣so do they outweigh them. The mercies we receive from God are (as the last sec∣tion has shewed) of the greatest import∣ance; the most substantial solid goods; and the greatest of all, I mean those which concern our eternal state, are so firmly fixed on us, that unless we will voluntarily quit our claim, 'tis not in the power of men or devils to defeat us. Light bodies are easily blown away by every gust of wind, but this <HI>weight of glory,</HI> as the Apostle calls it, 2 Cor. iv. 17. conti∣nues

firm and stable, is proof against all storms, like the <HI>shadow of a great rock in a weary land,</HI> Isa. xxxii. 2. Those dark sketches we have of it, might have served to refresh and deceive the tediousness of our pilgrimage, and therefore the most formidable calamities of this life are below all measures of comparison with this hope of our calling, this <HI>riches of the glory of our inheritance,</HI> Eph. iii. 16. The heaviest and most pressing of our afflictions are to that, <HI>but like the small dust of the balance,</HI> Isa. xl. 15. so that it we should here stop our inquisition, we have a sufficient reso∣lution of the present question, and must conclude, that God has given us an abun∣dant counterpoise of all, we either do or can suffer here.</P>
<P N="6">6. If therefore th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be any so forlorn as to temporal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that he can fetch hence no evidence of God's fatherly care of him, yet this one consideration may solve his doubts, and convince him that he is not abdicated by him. We read of no gifts <HI>Abraham</HI> gave <HI>Isaac,</HI> yet to the sons of the concubines 'tis said he did, Gen. xxv. 6. It had been a very fallacious inference, if <HI>Isaac</HI> should have concluded himself neg∣lected, because his far great por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtion was but in reversions. And it will the same in any of us, if we argue an unkindness
<PB N="67" REF="031170_0066_0FEEDE8D4BD12198"/>
from any temporal wants who have the entail of an eternal inheritance. But surely <HI>God does not leave himself without wit∣ness,</HI> Acts xiv. 17. even in secular things; there is no man breathing but has some blessings of his left hand, as well as his right, as I have already mentioned: and unless it be some few prodigies of calami∣ty, in whose punishment or patience God designs signally to glorify himself, there are none who enjoy not greater comforts of life than those they want, I mean such as are really greater, though perhaps, to their prejudicate fancies they do not ap∣pear so. Thus in point of health, if a man be disaffected in one part, yet all the rest of his body may be (and often is) well; or if he have a complication, and have more than one disease, yet there is no man that has all, or half so many as are incident to human bodies, so that he is comparatively more healthy than sick. So again it is not very common for a man to lose a limb, or sense; the generality of them keep them to their last; and they who do, have in that an overbalance to most out∣ward adversities; and even they who are so unhappy to lost one, yet commonly keep the rest, at least the major part: or if at any time any man is left a mere breathing trunk, yet it is by such stupify∣ing diseases as deaden the senses, or such mortal ones as soon take them away; and
<PB N="68" REF="031170_0067_0FEEDE9141D786F0"/>
so the remedy overtakes the malady. Be∣sides it pleases God very often to make compensation for the want of one member or faculty by improving the use of another. We have seen feel supply all the necessary uses of hands, to those that have had none; and it is a thing of daily observation that men that are blind, have their intellects more vigorous and active, by their ab∣stractions from visible objects.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thus also it is in the matter of wealth; he that is forced to get his bread by the sweat of his brows, 'tis true he cannot have those delicacies wherewith rich men abound, yet his labor helps him to a more poignant, more savoury sauce than a whole college of epicures can compound. His hunger gives a higher gust to his dry crust, than the surfeited stomach can find in the most costly, most elaborate mixture; So verifying the observation of <HI>Solomon, The full soul loatheth the honey-comb, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet,</HI> Prov. xxvii. 7. He cannot <HI>indeed stretch himself upon his bed of ivory,</HI> Amos vi. 4. yet his sleeps are founder than those that can.

He has the proper gennine use of clothing, the preventing shame and cold, and is happily determined to that which the wiser men of the world have voluntarily chosen. To conclude, he has one advantage beyond all these; his ne∣cessities rescue him from idleness, and all its consequent temptations; which is so great a benefit, that if rich men be not their own task-masters, as his wants are his, if they do not provide themselves of business, that one want of theirs is infi∣nitely more deplorable than all his; and he is not only happy comparatively with himself, in having better things than he wants, but with them also.</P>
<P N="8">8. If we come now to reputation and same, the account will be much the same, he that is eminent in the world for some great achievement, is set up as an object of every man's remark; when as his ex∣cellencies on one hand are visible, so his faults and blemishes are on the other. And as human frailty makes it too proba∣ble, these latter will be really more, so hu∣man envy makes it sure that they shall be more precisely, more curiously observed, and more loudly blazoned. So that up∣on

the whole, a good quiet security, tho' it be not the road to glory, yet is the like∣liest fence against infamy. And indeed, he that can keep up the repute of a sober integrity within his own private sphere, need not envy the triumphant sallies of o∣thers, which often meet with a fatal turn at the latter end of the day. But it will be said that even that more moderate sort of reputation is not every man's portion, but that many lie under great ignominy and scandal. I shall here ask whether these be just or unjust? If they be just they belong not to our present subject, which relates only to those inflictions which are the effects of God's immediate providence, not of our own crimes: For I never doubted but that by those we may divest ourselves of any, nay of all the good things God has designed us. But if the obloquy be unjust, 'tis probable that 'tis taken up only by ill men, and that the good pass a more equitable sentence; and then surely the attestation of a few such, is able to outweigh a multitude of the o∣thers. And in this case a man may only find patience but pleasure in reproaches. <HI>Socrates</HI> looked with trouble and jealousy on himself when ill men commended him. saying, what ill have I done? and sure a Christian has a farther reason to be pleased with their revilings, they being

his security against the <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> pronounced to those <HI>whom all men speak well of,</HI> Luke vi. 26. But sometimes it happens, that even good men are seduced and either by the artifices of the wicked, or their own too hasty credulity, give credit to unjust re∣ports. And this I confess is a sharp trial to the injured person, yet even this can∣not often be universal; there can scarce be any innocence so forlorn but that there may be opportunities of clearing it to some or other, and by them propagating it to more, and if the cloud ever come to be dispersed, their same will appear with the brighter lustre. But if none of this hap∣pen, they have yet a certain and more blessed retreat, even an appeal to the un∣erring Judge, who never beholds us with more approbation, that when we are under the unjust condemnation of men. Indeed we have then a double tie upon him, not only his justice but his pity is concerned in our cause. God particularly owns him∣self as the refuge of the oppressed, and there is scarce a sharper and more sensible oppression than this of calumny: Yet even this proves an advantage, whilst it pro∣cures God's immediate patronage, makes us the objects of his more peculiar care and compassion, who can <HI>make our righte∣ousness as clear as the light,</HI> Psal. xxxvii. 6. if he see it fit; but if in his wisdom he

<P>I have now instanced in the three most general concerns of human life, the body, goods, and fame, to which heads may be reduced most of the af∣flictions incident to our outward state, as far as immediately concern ourselves. But their is no man stands so single in the world, but has some relations or friends, in which he thinks himself intererested, and many times those oblique strokes which wound us through them, are as painful as the more direct; yet here also God is ordinarily pleased to provide some allays, if we would but take notice of
<PB N="73" REF="031170_0072_0FEEDED907482E78"/>
them. He who has had one friend die, has ordinarily divers others surviving; or if he have not that, usually God raises him up others. 'Tis true we cannot have a succession of fathers and mothers, yet we often have of other friends that are no less helpful to us: And indeed there are scarce in any thing more remarkable evi∣dences of Providence, than in this parti∣cular. <HI>He that is able out of stones to raise up children to Abraham,</HI> Matth. iii. 9. does many times by as unexpected a pro∣duction supply friends to the desolate. But we do sometimes lose our friends while they are living, they withdraw their kind∣ness which is the soul of friendship: And if this happen by our own demerit, we can accuse neither God nor them for it▪ nor can we rationally expect that God will provide supplies, when we wilfully despoil ourselves. But when they are unkind without provocation, then is the season for his interposition, who uses to take up <HI>those whom father and mother forsake,</HI> Psal. xxvii. 10. And we frequently see signal proofs of his care in exciting the compas∣sions of other friends and relatives, or perhaps of mere strangers. Nay some∣times God makes the inhumanity of a man's relations, the occasion of his ad∣vantage. Thus the barbarous malice of
<PB N="74" REF="031170_0073_0FEEDEA05F48CA00"/>
Joseph's brethren was the fist step to his dominion over Egypt. And it is a com∣mon observation in families, that the most discountenanced child oft makes better proof, than the darling.</P>
<P N="10">10. We are yet liable to a third afflic∣tion by the calamity of our friends, which by the sympathy of kindness presses us no less (perhaps more) sensibly than our own: But then it is to be considered, that theirs are capable of the same allaying circumstances that ours are, and God has the same arts of alleviating their burdens; so that we have the same arguments for acquiescence in their sufferings that we have in our own, and shall do a more friendly office in impressing those upon them, than in the most passionate adopt∣ing their sorrows.</P>
<P N="11">11. The last and greatest discomfort from friends, is that of that of their own: And if ever we may be allowed that dis∣consolate strain of the Prophet, Isa. xxii. 4. <HI>Look away from me, I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me;</HI> this seems to be the time: Yet even this <HI>valley of Achor is not without a door of hope,</HI> Hos. ii. 15. A vicious person may be recalled, multi∣tudes have been; so that as long as God continues life, we ought no more to de∣posite
<PB N="75" REF="031170_0074_0FEEDEA1F1FBC6C0"/>
our hope than to quit our endea∣vour. Besides there are few that make this complaint that have not something to balance, or at least to lighten it. I shall instance in that relation which is the near∣est and most tender, that of a parent. He that has one bad child may have divers good. If he have but one virtuous it is a very great mercy, and it is another that he may be the better taught to value it by the opposition of the contrary. But if any be so unhappy as to have many chil∣dren, and <HI>all to consume his eyes and grieve his heart.</HI> 2 Sam. ii. 33. it may be a sea∣sonable reflection for him to examine how far he has contributed to it, either by <HI>Eli's</HI> fond indulgence, or by a remiss and care∣less education; or which is worst of all, by his most impious example. If any, or all of those be found the cause, he is not so much to seek for allays to his grief, as for pardon of his sin: And when he has penitently retracted his own fault, he may then have better ground of hope that God may reform those of his children. In the mean time he may look on his own afflic∣tion in them as God's discipline on him, and gather at least this comfort from it, that his heavenly Father has more care of him, than he had of his, and does not leave him uncorrected.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="76" REF="031170_0075_0FEEDEA54BAB32A8"/>
12. Thus we see in all the concerns (which are the most common and import∣ant of human life, and wherein the justest of our complaints are usually founded) there is such a temperature and mixture, that the good does more than equal the ill, and not only in the grosser bulk, when our whole state is weighed together, but in every single branch of it; God having herein dealt with this little world man, as he has done with the greater, wherein he is observed to have furnished every coun∣try with specific remedies for their pecu∣liar diseases. I have only given these short hints by way of essay and pattern for the Reader's contemplation, which when he shall have extended to all those minute particulars wherein he is espe∣cially concerned, more curiously com∣pared his sufferings with his allays and comforts, I cannot doubt but he will own himself an instance of the truth of the present thesis, and confess, that he has much more cause of thankfulness than complaint.</P>
<P N="13">13. This I say, supposing his afflictions to be of those more solid and considerable sorts I have before mentioned. But how many are there who have few or none of such, who seem to be seated in the land of <HI>Goshen,</HI> in a place exempt from all the
<PB N="77" REF="031170_0076_0FEEDEA7E6951340"/>
plagues that infect their neighbours? And those, one would think, should give a rea∣dy vote to this conclusion, as having no temptation to resist it; yet I doubt it is far otherwise, that such men are of all the most unsatisfied. For though they have no crosses of God's imposing, they usually create a multitude to themselves. And here we may say with <HI>David, It is better to full into the hand of God, than into the hand of man.</HI> 2 Sam. xxiv. 14. It is easier to bear the afflictions God sends, than those we make to ourselves. His are limited both for quantity and quality, but our own are as boundless as those extravagant desires from which they spring.</P>
<P N="14">14. And this is the true cause why Contentment is so much a stranger to those who have all the outward causes of it, they have not definite measure of their desires; it is not the supply of all their real wants will serve their turn, their ap∣petites are precarious, and depend upon contingencies. They hunger not because they are empty, but because others are full. Many a man could have liked his own portion well enough, had he not seen another have something he liked better. Nay even the most inconsiderable things
<PB N="78" REF="031170_0077_0FEEDEA9819FC580"/>
acquire a value by being anothers, when we despise much greater of our own. <HI>Ahab</HI> might well have satisfied himself with the kingdom of <HI>Israel,</HI> had not <HI>Na∣both's</HI> poor plot lain in his eye. But so raving were his desires after it, that he disrelishes all the pomps of a crown, yea the ordinary refreshment of nature, <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n cat no bread.</HI> till he have that to furnish him with sallads, I Kings xxi. 2. And how many are there now at this day whose clothes fit uneasy, if they see another have had but the luck to be a little more inge∣niously vain; whose meat is unsavoury if they have seen but a greater rarity, a new∣er cookery at another's table; in a word, who make other peoples excesses the standard of their own felicities.</P>
<P N="15">15. Nor are our appetites only excited thus by our outward objects, but precipi∣tated and hurried on by our inward lusts. The proud man so longs for homage and adoration, that nothing can please him if that be wanting. <HI>Human</HI> can find no gust in all the sensualities of the <HI>Persian</HI> court, because a poor despicable <HI>Jew</HI> denies his obeisance, Esth. v. 13. The lustful so impatiently pursues his impure designs, that any difficulty he meets in them, makes him pine and languish like <HI>Amnon,</HI> who could no way recover his own health

but by violating his sister's honour, 2 Sam. xiii. 14. The revengeful labours under an hydropic thirst till he have the blood of his enemy: All the liquor of <HI>Absalom's</HI> sheep-sheering could not quench his, with∣out the slaughter of his brother, 2 Sam. xiii. 29. And thus every one of our pas∣sions keeps us upon the rack till they have obtained their designs. Nay when they have, the very emptiness of those acquisitions is a new torment, and puts us upon fresh pursuits. Thus between the impetuousness of our desires, and the emptiness of our enjoyments, we still <HI>dis∣quiet ourselves in vain,</HI> Psal. xxxix. 6. And whilst we have such cruel task-mas∣ters, it is not strange to find us groaning under our burdens. If we will indulge all our vicious or foolish appetites, think our lives bound up with them, and solicit the satisfaction of them with as impatient a vehemence, as <HI>Rachel</HI> did for children, Gen, xxx. 4. <HI>Give me them or I die;</HI> no wonder that we are always complaining of disappointments, since in these the very success is a defeat, and is but the exchang∣ing the pain of a craving ravenous sto∣mach, for that of a cloyed and nauseated. Indeed men of this temper condemn them∣selves to a perpetual restlessness, they are like phantastic mutineers, who when their superiors send them blanks to write their
<PB N="80" REF="031170_0078_0FEC8771742A2428"/>
own conditions, know not what will please them: And even Omnipotence itself can∣not satisfy these till it have new moulded them, and reduced their desires to a cer∣tainty.</P>
<P N="16">16. But in the mean time how unjustly do they accuse God of illiberality, because every thing answers not their humour? He has made them reasonable creatures, and has provided them satisfactions pro∣portionable to their nature; but if they will have wild irrational expectations, nei∣ther his wisdom, nor his goodness is con∣cerned to satisfy those. His supplies are real and solid, and therefore have no cor∣respondence to imaginary wants. If we will create such to ourselves, why do we not create an imaginary satisfaction to them? It were the merrier frenzy of the two, to be like the mad <HI>Athenian,</HI> that thought all the ships that came into the harbour his own: And it were better, <HI>Ixion</HI> like, to have our arms filled with a cloud, than to have them perpetually beating our own breasts, and be still tor∣menting ourselves with insatiable desires. Yet this is the state to which men volun∣tarily subject themselves, and then quarrel at God because they will not let them∣selves be happy. But sure their very complaints justify God, and argue that
<PB N="81" REF="031170_0080_0FEC877373F03808"/>
he has dealt very kindly with them, and afforded them all the necessary accommo∣dations of life: For did they want them, they would not be so sensible of the want of the other. He that is at perfect ease may feel with some vexation the biting of flea or gnat, which would not be at all observable if he were upon the rack. And should God change the scene, and make these nice people feel the destitution of necessaries; all these regrets about super∣fluities would be overwhelmed. In the mean time how deplorable a thing is it, that we are still the poorer for God's bounty, that those to whom he has open∣ed his hand widest, should open their mouth so too, in outcries and murmurs? For I think I may say, that generally, those that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he farthest removed from want, are so from content too; they take no notice of all the real substantial bles∣sings they enjoy, leave these (like the ninety-nine sheep in the wilderness) for∣gotten and neglected, to go in quest after some fugitive satisfaction, which like a shadow flies still faster in proportion to their pursuit.</P>
<P N="17">17. And now would God they could be recalled from this unprofitable chace, and instead of the horseleaches note, <HI>Give, give,</HI> Prov. xxx. 14. take up that of the

Psalmist, <HI>What shall I render to the Lord for all the benefits he hath done unto me?</HI> Psal. cxvi. 12. Let them count how many valuable or rather inestimable things they have received from his mercy, and then confront them with those corrections they have found from his justice; and if they do this impartially, I doubt not they will find wherewithal to check their highest mutinies; and will join with me in con∣fessing, that their good things abundantly outweigh their ill.</P>
<P N="18">18. If now we carry on the compari∣son to the last circumstance, and consider the constancy, we shall find as wide as dif∣ference. Let us take the Psalmist's tes∣timony, and there will appear a very dis∣tant date of his mercies and punishments. <HI>His mercies endure for ever,</HI> Psal. cxxxvi. 1. whereas his wrath <HI>endures but the twink∣ling of an eye,</HI> Psal. xxx. 5. And accord∣ingly God owns his acts of severity as his <HI>strange work,</HI> Isr. xxvii. 21. that which he resorts to only upon special emergen∣cies; but this mercies <HI>are renewed every morning,</HI> Lam. iii. 23. and doubtless we may all upon trial affirm the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame. There are many of the most necessary comforts of life which do not only sometimes visit us as guests, but dwell with us as inmates and domestics. How many are there who
<PB N="83" REF="031170_0082_0FEC8782A2732720"/>
have lived in a perpetual affluence from their cradles to their graves, have never known what it is to want? And though the goods of fortune are perhaps less con∣stant to some, yet the refreshments of na∣ture are usually so to all. We eat and drink, we sleep, we recreate, we converse in a continued circle, and go our round as constantly as the sun does. Or if God does sometimes a little interrupt us in it, put some short restraint upon our refresh∣ments, yet that comparatively to the time we enjoy them, is but proportionable to the stop he has sometimes made of the son, Josh. x. 13, 2 Kings xx. 9. or of the sea, Exod. xiv. 21. which as they were no subversions to the course of nature, so neither are those short pauses he sometimes makes, a repeal of those fixed and custo∣mary benefits his providence usually al∣lots us. But who is there can say that any one of his afflictions has been of equal continuance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has pressed him with so few intermissions? Perhaps be may have missed some few nights sleep; but what is that to a twelve-month's, or perhaps a whole life's enjoying it? It is possible his stomach and his meat have not always been ready together; but how much of∣tener have they met to his delight and generally those things that are most use∣ful, are but rarely interrupted. Nay, to
<PB N="84" REF="031170_0083_0FEC8784278464E0"/>
a great many even the delicacies of life are no less constant, and their luxuries are as daily as their bread: whereas unless their vices or their fancies create uneasinesses to them, those that come immediately from God's hand, make long intermissi∣ons and short stays. Yet for all this they that should measure by the incessantness of men's complaints, would judge that the scene was quite reversed, and that our good things are as <HI>Job speaks, swifter than a weaver's shuttle,</HI> Job vii. 6. whilst our ill, like <HI>Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>azy's</HI> leprosy <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eaus inseparably to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> 2 Kings v. 27.</P>
<P N="19">19. The truth is, we will not ourselves enjoy those intervals God allows us, but when a calamity does retire, we will still keep it in fiction and imagination; re∣volve it in our minds, and because it is possible it may return, look upon it as not gone. Like anguish, patients, we count ourselves sick on our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> day, because we expect a fit the next. A strange stupid folly thus to court vexation, and be mise∣rable in chimera. Does any man, or indeed any beast, desire to keep a distaste∣ful relish in his mouth, to chew the cud upon gall and wormwood? Yet cer∣tainly there a are multitude of people whose live are embittered to them merely by these fantastic imaginary sufferings. Nor
<PB N="85" REF="031170_0084_0FEC8785C3A067E0"/>
do we only fright ourselves with images and ideas of past calamities, but we dress up new bugbears and false terrors, are po∣etic and aerial in our inventions, and lay romantic scenes of distresses. This is a thing very incident to jealous natures, who are always raising alarms to them∣selves. A suspicious man looks on every body with dread. One man he fears has designs upon his fortune, another on his reputation: perhaps a third upon his life; whilst in the mean time, the only ill design against him is managed by him∣self; his own causeless fears and jealousies, which put him in a state of hostility with all the world, and do often betray him to the very things he groundlesly suspected. For it is not seldom seen than men have incurred real mischiefs by a fond solici∣tude of avoiding imaginary ones. I do not question but this is a state calamitous enough, and shall acknowledge it very likely that such persons shall have little or no truce from their troubles, who have such an unexhausted spring within them∣selves; yet we may say to them as the Prophet did to the house of <HI>Jacob, Is the spirit of the Lord straightened? are these his doings?</HI> Micah ii. 7. Such men must

not cry out that God's hand lies heavy upon them, but their own; and so can be no impeachment to the truth of our ob∣servation, that God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are of a longer duration, keep a more fixed steady course than his punishments. The result of all is, that the generality of mankind have good (things even as to temporals) which do in the three respects forementi∣oned exceed the ill. I mean the true and real ills which God sends, though not those fanciful ones they raise to themselves.</P>
<P N="20">20. And now why should it not appear a reasonable proposition that men should entertain themselves with the pleasanter parts of God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dispensations to them, and not always pore upon the harsher; especial∣ly since the former are so much a fairer object and perpetually in their eye, why should we look on the more sadning and distressing spectacles of human frailty or misfortune, thro' all the magnifying optics our fancies can supply, and perversly turn away our eyes from the chearfuller? Yet this God knows is too much the case with the most of us, How nicely and critically do we observe every little adverse accident of our lives? When alas! a whole current of prosperity glides by without our notice. Like little children our fingers are never off the sore place, till we have picked eve∣ry

light scratch into an ulcer. Hay, like the lewder sort of beggars, we make arti∣ficial sores to give us a pretence of com∣plaint. And can we then expect God should concern himself in the cure? In∣deed in the course of his ordinary provi∣dence there is no cure for such people, unless it be by revulsion, the making them feel the smart of some very great and pres∣sing affliction. They therefore put them∣selves under an unhappy dilemma, either to continue their own tormentors, or to endure the severest course of God's dis∣cipline. 'Tis true the last is the most eli∣gible, but I am sure the best way is to prevent both by a just and grateful sense of God's mercies, which will be yet fur∣ther illustrated, if we compare them with our own demerits.</P>

<HEAD>Of our Demerit towards God.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> IT is the common fault of our nature that we are very apt to be partial to our∣selves, and to square our expectations more by that wish, than by what we de∣serve. Something of this is visible in our dealings with men. We oft look to <HI>reap where we have not sowed.</HI> Matth. xxv. 24. expect benefits where we do none: Yet in civil transactions there are still remain∣ing such footsteps of natural justice, that we are not universally so unreasonable; all traffic and commerce subsisting upon the principle of equal retribution, giving one good thing for another equivalent; so that no man expects to buy corn with chaff, or gold with dross. But in our dealings with God, we put off even this common equity; are vast in our expecta∣tions, but penurious and base in our re∣turns; and as if God were our steward not our Lord, we require of him with a confidence proper only to those who ask their own; whilst in the interim, what we offer to him is with such a disdainful slightness, as if we meant it rather an alms than an homage.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="89" REF="031170_0088_0FEEDEC5FA4000A8"/>
2. God indeed is so munificent, that he <HI>prevents us with his blessings,</HI> Psal. xxi. 3. gives us many things before we ask; had he not done so we could not have been so much as in a capacity of asking. But though the first and fundamental mercies are absolute and free, yet the subsequent are conditional▪ And accordingly we find in scripture, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> makes no promise either concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his life or a better, but on condition of obedience. The Jews who had much larger proposals of temporal happiness than Christians have, yet never had them upon other terms. God ex∣pressly articled for the performance of his commands, and made all their enjoyments forfeitable upon the failure, as we may see at large in the book of Deuteronomy. And under the Gospel, St. <HI>Paul</HI> appro∣priates the <HI>promises as well of this life as of that to come unto godliness,</HI> 1 Tim. iv. 8. It will therefore be a material inquiry for every man, whether he have kept his title entire, and have not by breach of the condition forfeited his claim even to the most common ordinary blessings; for if he have, common reason will tell him he can challenge none; and that the utmost he can hope for, must be only upon a new score of unmerited favour.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="90" REF="031170_0089_0FEEDEC9679A7938"/>
3. And here certainly <HI>every mouth must be stopped, and all the world become guilty be∣fore God,</HI> Rom. iii. 19. For alas! who is there can say his obedience has been in any degree proportionable to his obligation? It is manifest we have all received abun∣dantly from God's hand, but what has he had from ours? I may challenge the best man, to cast up the account of his best day, and tell me whether his receivings have not infinitely exceeded his disburse∣ments; whether for any one good thing he has done, he has not received many. Nor is the disparity only in number, but much more in value. God's works are perfect, all he does for us, like the first six days productions, <HI>all are very good,</HI> Gen. i. but alas! our very <HI>righteousness is as filthy rags,</HI> Isa. lxiv. 6. We offer <HI>him the blind and the lame,</HI> Mal. i. 8. a few yawning drowsy prayers perhaps, where∣in he has the least share; the fuller cur∣rent of our thoughts, running towards our secular or sinful concerns. We drop it may be a scanty alms, wherein it is odds our vain-glory scrambles for a share with him, if it do not wholly ingross it. We sit an hour at a sermon, but it is rather to hear the wit or eloquence of the preacher, than the word of God. Like the duller sort of animals, we like well to have our itching ears scratched, but grow sturdy
<PB N="91" REF="031170_0091_0FEEDECAFA6A5880"/>
and restive when we should do what we are there taught. In a word, all our ser∣vices at the best are miserable, maimed and imperfect; and too often corrupt and unfound. So that God may well upbraid us as he did <HI>Israel, Offer it new to thy go∣vernor, will he be pleased with it?</HI> Mal. i. 8. These very iniquities of our holy things, are enough to defeat all our pretence to any good from God's hand. Yet God knows this is much the best side of us: It is not every one that can make so fair an appearance as this amounts to. With many, there is no place to complain of the blemishes of their sacrifices, for they offer none; of whom we may say in the words of the Psalmist, <HI>God is not in all their thoughts,</HI> Psal. x. 4. I fear there want not those who drive away the day, the week, nay the year, without remem∣bring in whose <HI>hand their time is,</HI> Psal. xxxi. 16. or paying him any solemn tri∣bute of it; who enjoy the services of all inferior creatures, without considering that theirs are more due to the supreme Lord: In a word, who live as if they were absolutely independent; had their existence purely from themselves, and had no Creator to whom they owed their be∣ing, or any consequent duty. And sure men who thus discard themselves from God's family, have very little reason to
<PB N="92" REF="031170_0090_0FEC87A6AB404FB8"/>
expect the provisions of it: Yet even such as these have the impudence to complain, if any things be wanting to their needs (shall I say) or to their lusts; can raving∣ly profane God's name in their impa∣tiencies, which they know not how to use in their prayers; as if the Deity were considerable in no other notion, than that of their caterer or steward.</P>
<P N="4">4. If now we seriously reflect, what can be more admirable than that infinite pa∣tience of God, who notwithstanding the miserable infirmities of the pious, and the lewd contempt of the impious, still goes on resolutely in his bounty, and conti∣nues to all mankind some, and to some all his temporal blessings? He has no obliga∣tion of justice to do so, for it is no part of his compact; he has none of gratitude, for he is perpetually affronted and diso∣bliged. Surely we may well say with <HI>Da∣vid, Is this after the manner of men, O Lord,</HI> I Chron. xvii. 17. Can the highest hu∣man indulgence bear any proportion with this divine clemency? No certainly, no finite patience but would be exhausted with the thousandth part of our provoca∣tions.</P>
<P N="5">5. But is not our dealing too as little after the manner of men; I mean of rea∣sonable
<PB N="93" REF="031170_0092_0FEC87B236C0FF90"/>
creatures? For us who have for∣feited our right to all, and yet by mere fa∣vour are still kept in the possession of many great blessings; for us to grow mutinous, because there is perhaps something more trifling which is denied us, is such a stupid ingratitude, as one would think impossible to human nature. Should a tenant with us have at once forfeited his lease, and maliciously affronted his landlord, he would sure think himself very gently dealt with, if he were suffered to enjoy but a part of his first estate; but we should think him not only insolent, but mad, who when the whole were left him, should quarrel and clamour if he might not have his cot∣tage adorned with marble floors, and gild∣ed roofs. Yet at this wild rate we be∣have ourselves to our great Landlord, grow pettish and angry if we have not every thing we can fancy, though we en∣joy many more useful, merely by his in∣dulgence. And can there be any thing imagined more unreasonable? Let us therefore, if not for piety, yet at least to justify our claim to rationality, be more ingenuous; let us not consult only with our fond appetites, and be thus perpetu∣ally soliciting this satisfaction; but rather reflect on what tenure we hold what we already have, even that of superabundant mercy; and fear, least like insolent beg∣gars,
<PB N="94" REF="031170_0093_0FEEDED31CB0F0B0"/>
by the impudence of our demands, we divert even that charity which was de∣signed us. In short, let every man, when he computes what he wants of his desires, reckon as exactly how much he is short of his duty; and when he has duly pon∣dered both, he will think it a very gentle composition to have the one unsupplied, so he may have the other remitted: and will see cause contentedly to sit down and say with honest <HI>Mephibosheth, What right have I to cry any more unto the king?</HI> 2 Sam. xix. 28. But if it be thus with us upon the mere score of our imperfections or omissions, what an obnoxious state do our innumerable actual sins put us in? If the spots of our sacrifices are provoking, what are our sacrileges and bold profanations? If those who neglect or forget God are listed among his enemies, what are those who avowedly defy him? Indeed he who soberly considers the world, and sees how daringly the divine Majesty is daily af∣fronted, cannot but wonder that the per∣versions of our manners, those prodigies in morality, should not be answered with as great prodigies in calamity too; that we should either have other ruin than that of <HI>Sodom,</HI> or the earth serve us for any other purpose than to be, as it was to <HI>Korah,</HI> Numb. xvi. 32. our living se∣pulchre.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="95" REF="031170_0094_0FEEDED6881F9ED0"/>
6. Nor is this forbearance of God ob∣servable only towards the mass and collec∣tive body of mankind, but to every man in particular. Who is there that if he ran∣sack his conscience, shall not find guilts enough to justify God in the utmost seve∣rities towards him? So that how much so∣ever his punishments are short of that, so much he evidently owes to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enity and compassion of God. And who is there that suffers in this world the utmost that God can inflict? We have a great many suffering capacities, and if those were all filled up to the height, our condition would scarce differ from that of the damn∣ed in any thing but duration. But God is more merciful, and never inflicts at that rate on us here. Every man's experience can tell him, that God discharges not his whole quiver at once upon him, but ex∣empts him in many more particulars than he afflicts him; and yet the same experi∣ence will probably tell most of us, that we are not so modest in our assaults upon God; we attack him in all his concerns (as far as our feeble malice can reach) in his sovereignty, in his honour, in his re∣latives, nay sometimes in his very essence and being. And as they are universal in respect of him, so also in regard of our∣selves: we engage all our powers in this war, do not only <HI>yield</HI> (as the Apostle
<PB N="96" REF="031170_0095_0FEEDED81DDA1318"/>
speaks) <HI>our members instruments of unrigh∣teousness,</HI> Rom. vi. 19. but we press them upon the service of sensual and vile lusts, even beyond our native propensions. Nor are only the members of our body, but the faculties of our souls thus employed; our understandings are busied first in con∣triving sins, and then excuses and dis∣guises for them; our wills are yet more sturdy rebels, and when the understand∣ing is beat out of all its out-works, yet sullenly keep their hold in spite of all con∣viction; and our affections madly rush on <HI>like the horse into the battle,</HI> Jer. viii. 6. de∣terred by nothing of danger, so there be but sin enough in the attempt.</P>
<P N="7">7. And now with what face can people that thus pursue an hostility, expect that it should not be returned to them? Does any man denounce war, and yet expect from his adversary all the caresses, the obligements of friendship? Self-defence will prompt even the meekest nature to despoil his enemy at least of those things which he uses, to his annoyance; and if God should give way even to that lowest degree of anger, where or what were we? For since we employ our whole selves against him, nothing but destruction can avert our injuries. But 'tis happy for us we have to do with one who cannot fear
<PB N="97" REF="031170_0096_0FEEDEDAE5823028"/>
us, who knows the impotence of our wild attempts, and so allays his resentment of our insolence, with his pity of our follies. Were it not for this, we should not be rest in a possibility so oft to iterate our provo∣cations; every wicked imagination and black design, would be at once defeated and punished by infatuation and frenzy: every blasphemous atheistical speech would wither the tongue, like that <HI>arm</HI> of <HI>Jero∣boam</HI> which he stretched against the pro∣phet, 1 Kings xiii. 4. and every impious act would, like the prohibited retrospect of <HI>Let's</HI> wife, fix us perpetual monuments of divine vengeance.</P>
<P N="8">8. And then how much do we owe to the mercy and commiseration of our God, that <HI>he suffers not his whole displeasure to arise,</HI> Psal. lxxviii. 38. that he abates any thing of that just severity he might use to∣ward us? He that is condemned to the gallows, would think it a mercy to escape with any inferior penalty. Why have we then such mean thoughts of God's cle∣mency, when he descends to such low compositions with us? corrects us so light∣ly as if 'twere only matter of ceremony and punctilio, the regard of his honour, rather than the execution of his wrath. For alas let him among us that is the most

innocent, and undeservedly afflicted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up his sins and sufferings, and he will see a vast inequality: and (had he not other grounds of assurance) would be al∣most tempted to think those were not the provoking causes, they are so unpropor∣tionably answered. He sins in innumer∣able instances, and is punished in few; he sins habitually and perpetually, and suf∣fers rarely and seldom; nay perhaps he has sometimes sinned with greediness, and yet God has punished with regret and re∣luctancy. <HI>How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim?</HI> Hos. xi. 8. And when all the disparities are considered, we must cer∣tainly join heartily in <HI>Ezra's</HI> confession, <HI>Thou, O God, has punished tis' less than our iniquities deserve,</HI> Ezra ix. 13.</P>
<P N="9">9. Nay besides all our antecedent, we have after guilts no less provoking, I mean our ungracious repinings at the light chas∣tisements of our former sins, our outcries upon every little uneasiness, which may justly cause God to turn our whips into scorpions; and according as he threaten∣ed <HI>Israel,</HI> Lev. xxvi. 18. <HI>to punish us yet seven times more.</HI> And yet even this does not immediately exasperate him. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ews were an instance how long he could hear with a murmuring generation; but certainly we of this nation are a greater;
<PB N="99" REF="031170_0098_0FEAE56C5A2DDFB0"/>
<HI>Yet let us not be high minded but fear,</HI> Rom. xi. 20. for we see at last the doom fell heavy though it was protracted; a suc∣cession of miraculous judgments pursued those murmurers, so that not one of them entered Canaan. And it is very observ∣able, that whereas to others sins God's denunciations are in scripture conditional and reversible; this was absolute and bound with an oath, <HI>He sware in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest,</HI> Psal. xcv. 11. And yet if we compare the hardships of the Israelites in the wilder∣ness with most of our sufferings, we shall be forced to confess our mutinies have less temptation, and consequently less ex∣cuse; from whence 'tis very reasonable to infer, as the greatness of our danger if we persist, so the greatness of God's long-suf∣fering towards us, who yet allows us space to reform; and sure new complaints found very ill from us, who are liable to so se∣vere an account for our old ones. I fear the most resigned persons of us will upon recollection find, they have upon one oc∣casion of other outvied the numbers of the Israelites' murmurs, therefore unless we will emulate them in their plagues, let us fear to add one more, left that make up the fatal sum, and render our destruction irrevocable.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="100" REF="031170_0099_0FEAE584D1A862C0"/>
10. Upon all these considerations it ap∣pears how little reason any of us have to repine at our heaviest pressures. But there is yet farther circumstance to be advert∣ed to, and is too applicable to many of us, that is, that out sins are not only the constant meritorious cause of our suffer∣ings, but they are also very often the in∣strumental cause also; and produce them not only by way of retaliation from God, but by a natural efficacy. <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, he that <HI>loves pleasure. shall be a poor man,</HI> and that <HI>a whorish woman shall bring a man to a piece of bread,</HI> Prov. vi. 26. <HI>that he that sits long at the wine, shall have redness of eyes,</HI> Chap. xxiii. 29, 30. <HI>that the sloth∣ful soul shall suffer hunger,</HI> Chap. xix. 15. and all these not by immediate supernatu∣ral infliction from God, but as the proper genuine effects of those respective vices. Indeed God in his original establishment of things, has made so close a connexion between sin and punishment, that he is not often put to exert his power in any extraordinary way, but may trust us to be our own beadles, our own <HI>backslidings reprove us,</HI> Jer. ii. 19. <HI>and our iniquities are</HI> of themselves enough to <HI>become our ruin.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. It may therefore be a seasonable question for every man to put to himself,
<PB N="101" REF="031170_0100_0FEAE588AD8536A8"/>
whether the troubles he labours under be not of this sort; whether the poverty he complains of, be not the effect of his riot and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, his sloth and negligence? whether when he cries out that <HI>his comeli∣ness is turned into corruption,</HI> Dan. x. 8. he may not answer himself, that they are his visits to the harlot's house, which have thus made <HI>rottenness enter into his bones,</HI> Hab. iii. 16. whether when he is beset with conten∣tions, and has wounds without cause, <HI>he has not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arried long at the wine;</HI> when he has lost a frend, whether he has not by some <HI>treacherous wound,</HI> Eccl. xxii. 22. forced him to depart: or when he lives under infamy, whether it be not only the echo of his own scandalous crimes. If he find it thus with him, certainly his mouth is s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opt, and he cannot without the most disingenuine impudence complain of any but himself. He could not be ignorant that such effects did naturally attend such causes, and therefore if he would take the one, he must take the other also. No man sure can be so mad, as to think God should work miracles (disunite those things which nature hath conjoined) only that he may sin at ease, and have none of the consequent smart. We read indeed God divided the sea, but it was to make <HI>the way for the ran∣somed of the Lord to pass over,</HI> Isa. ll.
<PB N="102" REF="031170_0101_0FEB14450EF48D60"/>
those who were his own people, and went, in at his command; but when they were secured, we find the waters immediately returned to their channel, and overwhelm∣ed the Egyptians, who ventured without the same warrant. And sure the case is alike here, when any man can produce God's mandate to run into all excess of riot; to desecrate the temple of the Holy Ghost, <HI>and make his body member of an har∣lot,</HI>1 Cor. vi. 15. In a word, when God bids him do any of those things, which God and good men a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hor, then and not before he may hope he may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from their native penal effects: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then (how profuse soever some legendary stories represent him) he will certainly ne∣ver so bestow his miracles.</P>
<P N="12">But I fear upon scrutiny there will appear a yet farther circumstance upon which to arraign our mutinies; for though it be unreasonable enough to charge God with the ill effect of our own leudness, yet it is a higher step to murmur because we have not materials to be wicked e∣nough. And this I fear is the case with too many of us, who though they are not so despoiled by their sins, but that they can keep up their round of vicious pleasures, yet are discontented because they think some others have them more
<PB N="103" REF="031170_0102_0FEB1447DCCDA070"/>
exquisite, think their vices are not gentle enough, unless they be very expensive, and are covetous only that they may be more luxurious. These are such as St. <HI>James</HI> speaks of, <HI>who ask amiss, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay consume if upon their lusts,</HI> Jam. iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and sure to be mutinous on this account is one of the highest pieces of frenzy. Would any man in his wits tell another he will cut his throat, and then expect he should furnish him with a knife for it? And yet to this amount our murmurs a∣gainst God, for his not giving us those things wherewith we only design to wage war with him. For surely if the discon∣tents of mankind were closely inspected, I doubt a great many would be found of this kind. It concerns the render there∣fore, to make the inquisition in his own breast, both in this and all the former particulars, and I doubt not, if he do it with any ingenuity and uprightness, he will be abundantly convinced that for his few mites of obedience he pays to God, he receives talents of mercies (even tem∣poral) from him: And that on the other side, that God as much underpays his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, as he overpays his services: By which God does sufficiently attest how little he delights i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our affliction; how gladly he takes any light occasion of caressing and cherishing, and overskips those of punish∣ing

us. Which sure ought to make us convert all our displeasures against our sins, which extort those acts of severity from him, to which his nature is most averse. And here indeed our resentments cannot be too sharp, but towards God our fittest address will be in the penitential form of the Prophet <HI>Daniel, O Lord, to us belong∣eth confusion of face, but to the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against him,</HI> Dan. ix. 8, 9.

<HEAD>Of God's general Providence.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN God made the universe, he intended not only to glorify himself in one transient act of his power, and then leave this great and wonderful production of his, as the <HI>ostrich her eggs in the wilderness,</HI> Lam. iv. 3. but having drawn it out of its first chaos, he secured it from returning thither again, by establishing as a due symmetry of parts, so also a regular order of motion: Hence it is that the heavens have their constant revolutions, the earth its succession of determinate seasons, ani∣mals their alternate course of generation and corruption; and by this wise econo∣my, the world after so many thousand years, seems still in its spring and first beauty. But it had been in vain to have thus secured the defection of the crea∣tures, if man for whose sake they were made had been excluded from this care. His faculty of reason would have made him but the more fatal instrument of con∣fusion, and taught him the more com∣pendious ways of disturbing the world. <HI>Job</HI> compares him <HI>to the wild asses colt,</HI> Job xi. 12. which takes its range without ad∣verting to any thing of the common good.
<PB N="106" REF="031170_0105_0FEB1451E3286D60"/>
God has therefore doubly hedged in this unruly creature, made a fence of laws about him (both natural and positive) and besides has taken him into the common circle of his providence, so that he, as well as the rest of the creation, has his particular station assigned him; and that not only in reference to other creatures, but himself; has put a difference between one man and another, ordained several ranks and classes of men, and endowed them with special and appropriate qualifi∣cations for those: stations wherein he has set them.</P>
<P N="2">This, as it is a work of infinite wis∣dom in God, so it is of unspeakable ad∣vantage to men. Without this regular disposure, the world would have been in the same confusion which we read of in the host of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ianlles, every man's sword against his fellow.</HI> Judg. vii. 22. Nothing but force could determine who should do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or enjoy any thing; and even that decision also would have been repeal∣able by a greater forces: So that we have all reason to confess the utility of that or∣der God has set among men; and even he that bears the lowest and most despica∣ble place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is certainly infinitely more happy by contributing to that general har∣mony
<PB N="107" REF="031170_0106_0FEB1453892BD2F8"/>
than he could be in any state of discord.</P>
<P N="3">Were this now well considered, methinks it should silence all our complaints, and men should not be so vehemently con∣cerned in what part of the structure it pleases the great Architect to put them; for every man is to look on himself only as a small parcel of those materials which God is to put into form. Every stone is not fit for the corner, not every little rafter for the main beam: The wisdom of the Master-builder is alone to determine that. And sure there cannot be a more vile contempt of the divine wisdom than to dispute his choice. Had God wisdom enough to contrive this vast and beautiful fabric, and may he not be trusted with one of us poor worms? Did he by his <HI>wisdom make the heavens, and by his under∣standing stretch out the clouds;</HI> Prov. iii. 19. and shall he not know where to place a little lump of figured earth? This is cer∣tainly the most absurd distrust imaginable, and yet this is really the true meaning of our repining at the condition he has placed us in.</P>
<P N="4">The truth is, we are so full of our∣selves, that we can see nothing beyond it: Every man expects God should place him
<PB N="108" REF="031170_0107_0FEB1456776A0CE8"/>
where he has a mind to be, though by it he discompose the whole scheme of his providence. But though we are are so senselessly partial, yet God is not so: He that comprehends at once that whole con∣cern of mankind, applies himself to the accommodating those, not the humouring any particular person. <HI>He that hath made the great and the small, and careth for all alike,</HI> Wisd. vi. 7. He is the common Father of mankind, and disposes things for the public advantage of this great fa∣mily, and it is not all the impatient crav∣ings of a froward child that shall make him recede from his designed method. We are apt enough, I am sure, to tax it not only as a weakness, but injustice too in a prince, when he indulges any thing to a private favourite to the public disadvan∣tage; yet so unequal are we, that we murmur at God for not doing that which we murmur at men for doing.</P>
<P N="5">Besides a man is to consider, that other men have the same appetites with himself. If he dislike an inferior state, why should he not think others do so too? and then as the wise man speaks, <HI>Whose voice shall the Lord hear?</HI> Ecclus. xxxiv. 24. It is sure great insolence in me to ex∣pect that God should be more concerned to humour me, than those multitudes of
<PB N="109" REF="031170_0108_0FEB145970C346C0"/>
others who have the same desires. And the more impatient my longings are, the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss in reason should be my hopes; for mutiny is no such endearing quality as to render any man a darling to God. But if all men should have equal satisfactions, we should puzzle even Omnipotence it∣self. Every man would be above and su∣perior, yet those are comparative terms; and if no man were below, no man could be above. So in wealth, most men desire more, but every man does at least desire to keep what he has; how then shall one part of the world be supplied without the diminution of the other, unless there should be as miraculous a multiplication of treasure for a man's avarice, as there was of loaves for their hunger, Matth. xvi. 9. It was a good answer which the ambassadors of an opprest province made to <HI>Anthony,</HI> <Q>If, O emperor, thou wilt have double taxes from us, thou must help us to double springs and harvests.</Q> And sure God must be at the expence of a new creation, make us a double world, if he should oblige himself to satisfy all the unreasonable appetites of men: And if he satisfy not all, why should any par∣ticular person look that his alone should be indulged to him?</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="110" REF="031170_0109_0FEB145D66FB9958"/>
6. Yet as unreasonable at it is, the most of us do betray such a persuasion. No man is discontented that there are lower, as well as higher degrees in the world, that there are poor as well as rich, but all sensible men assent to the fitness of it; yet if themselves happen to be set in the lower form, they exclaim as if the whole order of the world were subverted; which is a palpable indication that they think that Providence which governs others should serve them, and distribute to them not what it, but themselves think good. This immoderate self-love is the spring and root of most of our complaints, makes us such unequal judges in our own con∣cerns, and prompts us to put in caveats and exceptions on our own behalf, as <HI>David</HI> did on his son's, <HI>See that thou hurt not the young man Absalom,</HI> 2 Sam. xviii. 5. as if God were to manage the govern∣ment of the world with a particular re∣gard to our liking, and were like the an∣gels at <HI>Sodom,</HI> Gen. xix. 22. to <HI>do nothing till we had got into Zoar,</HI> had all our de∣mands secured to us.</P>
<P N="7">It would indeed astonish a consider∣ing man to see, that although the concerns of men are all disposed by an unerring Wisdom, and acknowledged by them∣selves to be so, yet that scarce any man
<PB N="111" REF="031170_0110_0FEB145F0CE00540"/>
is pleased. The truth is, we have gene∣rally in us the worser part of the Leveler's principle, and tho we can very content∣edly behold multitudes below us, yet are impatient to see any above us; not only the <HI>foot</HI> (to use the Apostle's simile) <HI>com∣plains that it is not the hand, but the ear because it is not the eye,</HI> 1 Cor. xii. 15, 16. Not only the lowermost, but the higher ranks of men are uneasy, if there be any one step above them. Nay so importunate is this aspiring humour, that we see men are forced to seed it, though but with air and shadows. He that cannot make any real advance in his quality, will yet do it in effigies, in all little gayeties and pa∣geantries of it. Every degree in these re∣spects not only emulates, but imitates its superior, till at last by that impatience of their proper distance they make it greater, and sink even below their first state by their ridiculous profusion. Indeed the world seems to be so over-run with this vanity, that there is little visible distinc∣tion of the degrees, and one had need go to the herald's office to know men's qua∣lities, for neither their habit nor equi∣page do now-a-days inform us with any certainty.</P>
<P N="8">But by all this it appears, that men look on themselves only as single persons,
<PB N="112" REF="031170_0111_0FEB146201870D60"/>
without reference to the community whereof they are members. For did they consider that, they would endeavour ra∣ther to become the places wherein they were set, by doing the duties belonging to them, than be perpetually projecting for a change. A tree that is every year transplanted, will never bear fruit, and a mind that is always hurried from its pro∣per station, will scarce ever do good in any. This is excellently expressed to us by <HI>Solomon, As a bird that wandereth from his nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place,</HI> Prov. xxvii. 8. 'Tis easy to divine the fate of those young ones from whom the dam wanders, and it is easy to guess how the duties of that place will be per∣formed, whose owner is always upon the wing, and making towards another. I wish we had not too costly experiments both in church and state, of the truth of this observation. Alas! we forget that we are all servants to the same Master, and that he is to appoint in what office we shall serve him. How should we like it in any of our own families, to have an in∣ferior officer leave his work undone, be∣cause he has more mind to be a superior officer? Yet this insolence we every day repeat towards God, sullenly dispute his order, and unless we may chuse our own employments, will do nothing.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="113" REF="031170_0112_0FEB1464D9395238"/>
It is evident, this perverse temper of mankind breeds a great deal of mischief and disturbance in the world, but would breed arrant confusion and subversion, if it were suffered to have its full range. If God permit but one ambitious spirit to break loose in an age, as the instrument of his wrath, what destruction does it of∣ten times make? How does it <HI>cause the whole earth to tremble, and shake kingdoms,</HI> as is said of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> Isa. xiv. 16. and may be said of many others of those wholesale robbers who have dignified the trade? But if every aspiring humour should be as prosperous, where would it find fuel to maintain the flame? No doubt every age produces men of as unbounded desires as <HI>Alexander</HI> or <HI>Cesar,</HI> but God gives them not the same opportunity to trouble the world. And accordingly in the more petty ambitions of private men he often orders it so, that those soaring minds can find no benign gale to help ther mounting. He that sets bounds to the sea, saying <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come and no farther; and tho' the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail, tho' they roar, yet can they not pass over.</HI> Jer. v. 22. does also depress the swelling pride of men, hangs clogs and weights upon them, that they cannot rise to their affected height. For tho' we are all willing to
<PB N="114" REF="031170_0113_0FEB1467CB5323B0"/>
forget it, yet God remembers that he is the Ruler of the universe, and will assort his dominion. The subtilest contrivance cannot circumvent him, the most daring pretender cannot wrest any thing out of his hand; the <HI>Lord will still be king, be the people never so impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt,</HI> Psal. xcix. 1. It will therefore sure be as well our prudence as our duty, to be <HI>still and know that he is God,</HI> Psal. xlvi. 10. with an humble for∣saking of our own wills, acquiesce in his, and not by ineffective strugglings provoke, whom we are sure never to subdue. We may, like unmanaged horses, foam and fret, but still God has the bridle in our jaws, and we cannot advance a step fur∣ther than he permits us. Why should we then create torment to ourselves by our repinings, which only sets us further from our aims. It is God's declared method to exalt the lowly, and it is observable in the two first kings of Israel, who were of God's immediate election, that he surpris∣ed them with that dignity, when they were about mean and humble employments, the one searching his father's asses, the other keeping his father's sheep: And would men honestly and diligently exercise them∣selves in the business of their proper call∣ing, they might perhaps find it a more di∣rect road to advancement, than all the si∣nister arts by which ambitious men endea∣vor

to climb. <HI>Solomon</HI> sets it down as an example, <HI>Seest thou a man diligent in his bu∣siness, he shall s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond before kings, he shall not stand before mean men,</HI> Prov. xxii. 29. But whether it happen to have that effect or no, it will have a better, for it will sweaten his present condition, divert his mind from mutinous reflections on other men's height, and his own lowliness; for it is common∣ly men who mind not their work that are at so much leisure to gaze. He that care∣fully plies his own business, will have his thoughts more concentrated; and doubt∣less it is no small happiness to have them so, for it is their gadding too much a∣broad, looking on other men's conditions that sends them back (like <HI>Dinah</HI> deflow∣ered) to put all in all in an uproar at home. The son of <HI>Syrach</HI> speaks with transporta∣tion of the state even of him that labours and is content, and calls it <HI>a sweet life,</HI> Ec∣clus. xl. 18. And certainly it is infinitely more so than that of the greatest Prince, whose mind swells beyond his territories.</P>
<P N="10">Upon all these considerations, it cannot but appear very reasonable, that we should leave God to govern the world; not be putting in like the sons of <HI>Zebedee,</HI> for the highest seats, but continually rest ourselves where he has placed us, till his Providence (not our own designs) advance

us. We can no where be so obscure as to be hid from his eyes, who as he valued the widow's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> above the great oblati∣ons of the rich, so he will no less graci∣ously accept the humble endeavors of the mean, than the more eminent services of the mighty; himself having declared, That he accepts, <HI>according to what a man path, and not according to what he hath not,</HI> 2 Cor. viii. 12. So that in what rank soe∣ver a man is set, he has still the opportuni∣ty of approving himself to God; and tho' in the eye of the world he be a vessel of dishonor, yet in the day that God comes to <HI>make up his jewels,</HI> Mal. iii. 17. there will be another estimate made of him who re∣gularly moves in his own sphere. And sure he that sits down in this acquiescence is a happier man, than he that enjoys the greatest worldly splendor; but infinitely more so than he who impatiently covets but cannot attain them: For such a man puts himself upon a perpetual rack, keeps his appetites at the utmost stretch, and yet has nothing wherewith to satisfy them. Let therefore our ease, if not our duty prompt us to acquiescence, and a ready submission to God's disposals; to which we have yet a further inducement from that distinct care he hath over every man's peculiar, by which he proportions to him what is really best for him; of which we

<HEAD>Of God's particular Providence.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the imperfection of our finite na∣ture that we cannot at once attend to di∣vers things, but the more vehement our intention is upon one, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greater is our neglect of the rest. But God's infinity cannot be so bounded; his eyes at once see, and his providence at once orders all the most distant and desperate things in the world. He is not such an epicurean deity, as to sequester himself wholly to the enjoyment of his own felicity, and to despise the concerns of poor mortals; but though he have his <HI>dwelling so high, yet he
<PB N="118" REF="031170_0117_0FEB14745A34F430"/>
humbleth himself to behold the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings in hea∣ven and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Psal. cxiii. 5, 6. Nor does his providence confine itself to the more splendid and greater parts of management, the conduct of empires and states, but it descends to the lowest part of his creati∣tion, to the fowls of the air, to the lilies of the field; and then sure our Saviour's in∣ference as to mankind is incontestable, <HI>Are ye not much better than they?</HI> Matth. 26. If a sparrow (as he elsewhere tells his dis∣ciples) cannot fall to the ground without God's particular notice, surely no human creature is less considerable to him; nay, if our very hairs are numbered, we can∣not think ths excrescence is of more va∣lue than the stoke, but must conclude that God with a particular advertence, watches over the concerns of every man.</P>
<P N="2">Now God being infinitely good, can∣not thus attend us upon any insidious de∣sign of doing us mischief: He watches o∣ver us as a guardian, not as a spy; and di∣rects his observation to the more seasona∣ble adapting his benefits. And as he is thus gracious in designing our advantage, so he is no less wise in contriving it. <HI> All things,</HI> says the wise man, <HI>are not profitable for all men,</HI> Ecclas. xxxvii. 28. Indeed nothing is absolutely good but God: all created things are good or ill reference to

that to which they are applied. Meat is good, but to a surfeited stomach it is not only nauseous, but dangerous. Fire is good, but if put in our bosoms, not only burns our clothes but flesh. And as hu∣man wisdom directs the right application of these and the like, so the supreme and divine, orders events according to the disposition of the person concerned; <HI>he knows our frame,</HI> Psal. ciii. 14. and dis∣cerns what operation such or such things will have upon us, while we who know neither ourselves nor them, can make but random guesses, and worse choices. And sure he that does but thus in the general, acknowledge God's providence, goodess and wisdom (which he is no christian that does not) has a sufficient cure against all his solicitudes, much more his repinings. He cannot think he suffers unawares to him who sees all things. He cannot think his sufferings are designed for ill to him, because they are disposed by him who in∣tends and projects his good. Nor can he fear those intentions can miscarry, which are guided by an infinite and unerring wisdom, and backed by an uncontrolable power. And sure this is as the Apostle speaks, Heb. vi. 18. <HI>strong consolation,</HI> if we would duly apply it.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="120" REF="031170_0119_0FEB1477C73CC498"/>
Yet because general notions do of∣ten make but light impressions on us, it may not be amiss to make a little more in∣spection, and to observe how applicable they are to to the several kinds of our dis∣contents. Now those may be reduced to two; for either we are troubled at the want of something we desire, or at the suffering of something we would avert; so that the two notions of privative and positive, divide between them all our af∣fliction.</P>
<P N="4">The first of these is usually the most comprehensive, for there are few who have not more torment from the appre∣hension of somewhat they want, than from the smart of any thing they feel. And indeed while our desires are so va∣grant and exorbitant, they will be sure to furnish matter enough for our discontents. But certainly there is not in the world such a charm for them, as the considera∣tion that God is more wise to discern, and more careful to provide what is really good for us than we ourselves. We poor shortsighted creatures look only on the surface of things, and if we see a beautiful appearance, somewhat that invites our sen∣ses, we court it with the utmost earnest∣ness: but God penetrates deeper, he sees to the bottom both of us and those things
<PB N="121" REF="031170_0120_0FEB147C03B43E00"/>
we desire, and find often though they may please our appetite, they will hurt our health; and will no more give them to us, than a careful father will to his child those gilded poisons he cries for. Perhaps this man is taken with the enchanting mu∣sic of fame, likes not his own obscure sta∣tion, but would fain present himself upon a more public. Theatre, come into the eve and could of the world; but how little does he know how he shall act his part there; whether he shall come off with an applause or a hiss? He may render himself but the more public spectacle of scorn; or if he do not that, he may by a better success, feed up his vain glory to such a bulk, as may render him too great weight for that tottering pinnacle whereon he stands: and so after he has made a tower∣ing circle, he may fall back with more ignominy to his first point. Another it may be, no less eagerly desires wealth, thinks (as once <HI>Croesus</HI> did) that he that abounds in treasure cannot be empty of felicity; but alas how knows he how he shall employ it? There are two contrary temptations that attend riches, riots, and covetousness; and he is sure a little too confident, that dares promise himself that when there is such odds against him, he shall certainly chuse the one just mean;
<PB N="122" REF="031170_0121_0FEB147FFA8769E8"/>
and if he do not, he does only inflame his account at the great audit. Besides the more wealth he has, the fairer booty he is to the avarice of others; and it has been often seen, that many a man had not died so poor, if he had lived less rich. Ano∣ther perhaps thinks not himself so much to want wealth as children to heir it, and complains with <HI>Abraham, Lord, what wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thou give me, seeing I go childless?</HI> Gen. xv. 2. yet how knows he whether that child he so much desires, <HI>shall be a wise man or a fool,</HI> Eccl. ii. 19. a comfort or a vexa∣tion to himself if he live to see his proof? and if he do not, be does but project for an access to his dying cares in what hands to leave him. <HI>Rachel</HI> solicited this satis∣faction with the greatest impatience, <HI>give me children, or I die,</HI> Gen. xxx. I. and 'tis observable that the grant of her wish proved the loss of her life.</P>
<P N="5">Thus in these and innumerable other instances we drive on blindfold, and very often impetuously pursue that which would ruin us: and were God as short-sighted as we, into what precipices should we mi∣nutely hurry ourselves? or were he so un∣kind as to consider our importunity more than our interest, we should quickly sink under the weight of our own wishes; and as <HI>Juvenal</HI> in his tenth satire excellently

observes, become pettish by the successes and grant of our prayers. I suppose there is no man that soberly recollects the events of his life, but can experimentally say, he has sometimes desired things which would have been to his mischief had he had them, and that himself has after looked on the denial as a mercy: as on the other side when he has prospered in his aims, and had what his soul lusted after, it has been but like the quails to the Israelites, a conviction and punishment, rather than a satisfaction. And now surely God may complain of us as he did of Israel, <HI>How long will it be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er you believe me?</HI> Num. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iv. II. After all the attestations he has given of his care and Providence over us, after all the experiments we have had of the folly of our own elections, we cannot yet be brought either to distrust ourselves, or rely upon him. We will still be chus∣ing, and look on him as no farther con∣cerned, than as the executioner of our designs.</P>
<P N="6">This is certainly a strange perverse∣ness, and such as no sensible man would be guilty of in any other instance. In all our secular affairs we trust those whom we have cause to think understand them better than ourselves, and rely upon men in their own faculty. We put our estates
<PB N="124" REF="031170_0123_0FEB148597863398"/>
into the lawyer's hand, our bodies into the physician's, and submit to their ad∣vice though it be against our humour, merely because we account them more competent judges. Yet this submission we cannot be persuaded to pay to God, but will still be prescribing to him, and are very angry it his dispensations do not exactly answer our fancies. And can we offer him a greater affront than thus to li∣mit him? What is it but interpretatively to deny either his wisdom, or his good∣ness, or both? and so derogate from him in two of his essential attributes. For there can be no rational account given by any who believe those, why they should not remit their whole concerns to him. So that the short account is, that in our dis∣trust, we either deny him to be God, or ourselves to be men, by resisting the most evident dictates of that reason which dis∣tinguishes us from brutes. For certainly there is not in human discourse a more irrefragable maxim, than that we ought for our own sakes to resign ourselves to him, who, we are infallibly sure, can, and will chuse better for us than we for ourselves.</P>
<P N="7">This was so apparent by mere natu∣ral light, that <HI>Socrates</HI> advised men to pray only for blessings in general, and
<PB N="125" REF="031170_0124_0FEB14878129E5B8"/>
leave the particular kind of them to God's election, who best knows what is good for us. And sure this is such a piece of divinity, as extremely reproaches us Chris∣tians, who cannot match a Heathen in his implicit faith to God. Nay indeed 'tis the vilest defamation upon God himself, that we who pretend to know him more, should trust him less. So that we see our repinings do not terminate in their own proper guilt, but do in their consequences swell higher, and our discontents propa∣gate themselves into blasphemy. For while we impatiently complain of our wants, we do tacitly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ax God to want ei∣ther that wisdom, power or love, where∣by he should supply us. And sure he must be very atheistical to whom this will not give a competent prejudice against this sin.</P>
<P N="8">And this very consideration will e∣qually prejudge the other branch of our discontents, I mean those which repine at the ills we suffer. And not only our pri∣vative, but our positive afflictions may by it have their bitterness taken off: for the same goodness and wisdom which denies those things we like, because they are hurtful for us, does upon the very same reason give us those distasteful things

<P>IT were the work of a volume to give an exact and minute account of the benefit of afflictions. I shall only point at some of the more general and obvious. And first, it is one of the most awakening calls to repentance; and to this end it is that God most usually designs it. We see the whole scene of it.

they will seek me early:</HI> and in the very next verse we find this voice of God echoed forth by a penitential note, <HI>Come, and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath turn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</HI> Thus we find the brethren of <HI>Joseph,</HI> though there had a long interval passed betwixt their barbarous usage of him, and his feigned rigor to them, yet when they saw them∣selves distressed by the one, then they be∣gan to recollect the other, saying, <HI>We are very guilty concerning our brother,</HI> Gen. xlii-21. Prosperity is an intoxicating thing, and there are few brains strong enough to bear it; it lays us asleep, and amuses us with pleasant dreams, whilst in the mean time <HI>Satan</HI> rifles our treasures, and spoils us, by the deceitful charms of sins, of our innocency and real happiness. And can there be a more friendly office done for a man in this condition, than to rouse him, and bring him to apprehend the de∣signs that are said against him? and this is the errand on which afflictions are sent: so that we have reason to look on them as our friends and confederates, that in∣tend our rescue, and to take the alarm they give us, and diligently seek out those intestine enemies of which they warn us.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they tell bin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th, truth,</HI> Gal. iv. 10. does miserably pervert <HI>the counsel of God against himself,</HI> Luke vii. 30. and may at last verify his own jealousies, and by so provoking an ingratitude, convert those into the wounds of an enemy, which were originally meant as the corrections of a father.</P>
<P N="2">And as afflictions do in general ad∣monish us of sins, so it pleases God most frequently so to model and frame them, that they bear the very image and impress of those particular guilts they are to chas∣tise, and are the dark shadows that attend our gay delights, or fragrant insolence. The wise man observes, that the turning the Egyptian waters into blood, was ma∣nifest reproof of that cruel commandment for murdering of the Hebrew infants <HI>Wisd.</HI> xii. 5. And surely we might in most, if not all our sufferings, see some such cor∣responding circumstances, as may lead us to the immediate provoking cause of it. God who does all things in number, weight and measure, does in punishments also observe a symmetry and proportion, and adapts them not only to the heinous∣ness, but even the very specific kind of our crimes. The only fixed immutable rule he has given for his Vicegerents on earth to punish by, is that in the case of murder,
<PB N="129" REF="031170_0128_0FEB1492F5DEAE10"/>
which is we see grounded on this rule of proportion, <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> blood be shod</HI> Gen. ix. 6. And though he hath now cut off the inferior retaliations of the <HI> eye for the eye, the tooth for the teeth,</HI> Exod. xxi. 24. (probably for the hardness of our hearts, because he saw our revengeful natures would be too much pleased with it) yet he has not pre∣cluded himself from acting by those mea∣sures, but we see it does very often signal∣ly make men feel the smart of those vio∣lences, or injustice they have used to o∣thers. Of this the sacred story affords several examples (as <HI>Adonibezek,</HI> Judg. i. 6. and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> 1 King. xxi 19.)and profane many more, and daily experience and ob∣servation most of all. And though this method of retaliation is not always so evi∣dent and apparent to the world, because men's sins are not always so, yet I believe if men would duly recollect, it would be for the most part discernable to their own conscience, and they would apparently see, that their calamities did but trace the footsteps of their sins.</P>
<P N="3">Now if we rightly weigh this, we cannot but think it a very advantageous circumstance. We are naturally blind, when we look inward, and if we have not some adventitious light to clear the object,
<PB N="130" REF="031170_0129_0FEB1495C84F1B10"/>
will be very apt to overlook it. Therefore since the end of all our afflictions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s our repentance, it is a wise and gracious dispo∣sal that they do thus point to us those particular sins of which we are to repent. The body of sin will not be destroyed in the whole entire bulk, but must be dis∣membered, pulled to pieces limb by limb. He that attacks it otherwise, will be like <HI>Sertorius's,</HI> soldier, who ineffectively tug∣ged at the horse's tail to get it off at once, when he that pulled it hair by hair quickly did it. Therefore as it a great part of our spiritual wisdom to know in what especial parts the <HI>Sampson</HI> like strength of our cor∣ruptions lie, so it is a great instance of God's care of us, thus by his corrections to discipline and instruct us in it.</P>
<P N="4">In all our afflictions therefore it is our concern, nicely and critically to ob∣serve them. I mean not to enhance our murmurs and complaints, but to learn by them what is God's peculiar controversy against us. This is indeed <HI>to bear the rod, and who hath appointed it,</HI> Mic. vi. 9. Let him therefore that suffers in any of his concerns, examine whether he have not some guilt which answers to it, <HI>as face answers face,</HI> Provi xxvii. 19. He that is impoverished in his estate, let him con∣sider first how he acquired it▪ whether
<PB N="131" REF="031170_0130_0FEB1499C09575B8"/>
there were not something of fraud or in∣justice, which like a canorous humour, mixt in its very elements and constitution, and eat out its bowels: Or whether some sacrilegious prize, some coal from the al∣tar have not fired his nest. Or if nothing can be charged upon the thing gained, let him consider how he has used it; whe∣ther he has not made it the fuel of his lusts, in riot and excesses, or the object of his adoration in an inordinate value of it. In like manner he who is afflicted in his body, groans under the torment of some grievous disease, may very seasonably interrogate himself, whether it has not been contracted by his vice, whether <HI>his bones be not</HI> (in a more literal sense than <HI>Job</HI> meant it) <HI>full of the sins of his youth,</HI> Job xx. 11. and his surfeiting and drun∣kenness be not the cause, <HI>that his soul,</HI> as the Psalmist speaks, <HI>abhors all manner of next, and is even hard at death's door,</HI> Psal. evii. 18. or at least whether the not employing his health and strength to those purposes for which it was given, is not the reason of its being withdrawn. He also that is invaded in his reputation, that lies under some great infamy, is to consider whether it be not deserved; whether some part, if not the whole guilt of which he is accused, stick not to him: Or if he be clear in that particular instance, whether
<PB N="132" REF="031170_0131_0FEB149B709FA990"/>
some concealed sin of his would not if it were known, incur as great scandal. For in that case he has in right forfeited his reputation, and God may make the seiz∣ure as well by an unjust, as a just accusa∣tion. Or if his heart accuse him not here, yet let him further reflect, whether; his vain-glorious pursuits of praise and high conceits of himself, have not made this an apt and necessary humiliation for him. Or lastly, let him recollect how he has be∣haved himself towards others in this kind: Whether he has had a just tenderness of his neighbour's fame, or has not rather exposed and prostituted it. In these and many other instances such a particular scrutiny would (in all probability, disco∣ver the affinity and cognation between our guilts and our punishments, and by mark∣ing out the spring and fountain-head, di∣rect us how to stop or divert the current. And he that would diligently employ himself in this inquisition, would find lit∣tle leisure, and less cause to condole his afflictions, but would divert all his com∣plaints upon himself, <HI>accept of the punish∣ment of his iniquity, and thank the Lord for thus giving him warning,</HI> Psal. xvi 7.</P>
<P N="5">A second benefit which God designs us in our afflictions, is the weaning us from the world, to disentangle us from its set∣ters
<PB N="133" REF="031170_0132_0FEB149E844D7C78"/>
and charms, and draw us to himself. We read in the story of the deluge that so long as the earth was covered with wa∣ters, the very raven was contented to take shelter in the ark, but when all was fair and dry, even the dove finally forsook it, Gen. viii. 12. And it is much so with us: The worst of men will commonly in distresses have recourse to God (the very heathen mariners in a storm could rebuke <HI>Jonah</HI> for not calling upon his God, Jon. i. 6.) when yet the very best of us are apt to forget him amidst the blandishments and insinuations of prosperity. The kind aspects of the world are very enchanting, apt to inveigle and besot us; and there∣fore it is God's care over us, to let us sometimes see her more averting counte∣nance in her frowns and storms; that, as children frighted by some ugly appear∣ance, we may run into the arms of our Father. Alas! were all things exactly sitted to our humours here, when should we think of a remove? and had not death some harbingers to prepare us for him, what a surprising guest would he be to us? 'Tis storied of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> that seeing a soldier in his camp of so daring a cou∣rage, that he always courted the most ha∣zardous attempts, and observing him also of a very infirm sickly habit, he took a
<PB N="134" REF="031170_0133_0FEB14A27B134A80"/>
particular care of him, and by medicines and good attendance recovered him; which no sooner had he done, but the man grew more cautious, and would no longer expose himself as formerly, and gave this reason for it, that now he was healthy, his life was of some value to him, and not to be hazarded at that same rate, as when it was only a burden; and should God cure all our complaints, render us perfectly at ease, I fear too many of us would be of the soldier's mind, think our lives to good to resign to him, much more to hazard for him, as our Christi∣anity in many cases obliges us. The son of <HI>Syrach</HI> observes, how <HI>dreadful death is to a man that is at rest in his possessions, that hath abundance of all things, and hath no∣thing to vex him;</HI> nay he descends much lower, and puts in him <HI>who is yet able to receive meat,</HI> Ecclus. xiv. 1. The truth is, we do so passionately doat upon the world, that like besotted lovers we can bear a great deal of ill usage, before we quit our pursuit. Any little slight favour atones us after multiplied affronts, and we must be disciplined by repeated disap∣pointments, e'er we can withdraw our confidence. But how fatally secure should we be, if God should permit this siren al∣ways to entertain us with her music, and should not by some discordant grating
<PB N="135" REF="031170_0134_0FEB14A422E78818"/>
notes, interrupt our raptures, and recall us to sober thoughts?</P>
<P N="6">Indeed it is one of the highest in∣stances of God's love, and of his clemen∣cy also, thus to project our reducement. We were all in our baptism affianced to him, with a particular abrenunciation of the world, so that we cannot without the greatest disloyalty cast ourselves into its embraces; and yet when we have thus <HI>broken the covenant of our God,</HI> God, Prov. ii. 17. he does not pursue us with a jealous rage, with the severity which an abused rivalled kindness would suggest; doth not give us a bill of divorce and disclaim his rela∣tion; but contrives how he may reclaim and bring us back to himself. The tran∣scendency of this lenity God excellently describes by the prophet in the case of <HI>Is∣rael, They say, if a man put away his wife, and she become another man's, shall he return unto her again? but thou hast played the har∣lot with many lovers, yet return unto me saith the Lord?</HI> Jer. iii. 1. And this, though a great height of indulgence, is no more than he daily repeats to us. After we have basely adulterated with the world, converted our affections from God to it, he does not give us over, abandon us to our lewd course, and consequent ruin; but still invites our return: and lest that
<PB N="136" REF="031170_0135_0FEB150EC66B2870"/>
may not serve, he does with a great deal of holy artifice essay to break that accurs∣ed league into which we are entered, pulls off the disguise in which the world court∣ed us, and makes us see it as it is in itself, a scene of <HI>vanity and vexation of spirit,</HI> Eccles. i. 14.</P>
<P N="7">And as he does this in general, so also with a particular application to those temporal satisfactions wherewith we were most transported. The things to which we are more indifferent do not so much endanger us; it is those upon which we have more vehemently set our hearts, which become our snares, and awake his jealousy; and accordingly we frequently see that it is in those he chuses to cross us. How often does it happen that those which are enamoured of themselves, dote upon their own features, do meet with some disease or accident which blasts their beauty, withers that fair flower, and makes their winter overtake their spring? So in our friends and relations it is usually seen, we soonest loose those for whom we have the greatest, the most immode∣rate passion. If there be one fondling among our children, it is odds but that is taken away, or made as much the ob∣ject of our grief and sorrow, as ever it was of our joy and love. When God
<PB N="137" REF="031170_0136_0FEB14A714A1C8B8"/>
sees our hearts so excessively cleave to any transitory thing, he knows it is necessary to sever them, for whilst we have such clogs upon us, <HI>our souls will cleave to the dust,</HI> will not be able to soar up to the highest Region for which they are de∣signed.</P>
<P N="8">In a word, God so loves us, that he removes whatever he sees will obstruct that intimate union which he desires with us; and sure this is so obliging, that though he should bid us to our loss, tho' he could not recompence us for what he takes from us, yet we must be very ill-natured if we can be angry at so much kindness. But when to this is added, that all this is principally, nay, solely de∣signed for our advantage, that God takes from us all these empty delusory content∣ments, merely that he may instate us in solid and durable joys; we betray as much ignorance of our interest, as insensible∣ness of our obligation, if we repine that God makes us so much his care. It is true indeed, the things to which we have so inordinately adhered, do stick so close, that they cannot be pulled away without some pain: yet for our corporal security we can endure the sundering of parts that do not only cleave, but grow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o us. He
<PB N="138" REF="031170_0137_0FEB14A9EB14DEA0"/>
that has a gangrened member, suffers it to be cut off to save his whole body, and does not revile, but thank and reward the surgeon. Yet where our souls are con∣cerned, and where the things have no native union with us, but are only ce∣mented by our passions, we are impatient of the method, and think God deals very hardly with us, not to to let us perish with what we love. The sum of all is this, God, though he be abundantly con∣descending, yet he will never stoop so low as to share his interest in us with the world: If we will devote ourselves to it, it is not all our empty forms of service will satisfy him; if we cannot divorce our hearts from it, he will divorce himself eternally from us. And the case being thus, we are surely very ill advised if we do not contentedly resign ourselves to his me∣thods, and cheerfully endure them how sharp soever. The only expedient we have for our own case, is to shorten the cure by giving our assistance, and not by struggling to render it more difficult and painful. Let us entirely surrender our wills to him, and when we have done that, we may without much pain let him take any thing else. But the more difficult we find it to be disentangled from the world, the greater should our caution be against all future engagements to it. If our escape
<PB N="139" REF="031170_0138_0FEB14ADE6949A28"/>
hath been as the apostle says, <HI>so as by sire,</HI> Jude 23. with much smart and hazard, let us at least have so much wit, as the common proverb allows children, and not again expose ourselves; let us never glue our hearts to any external thing, but let all the concerns of the world hang loose about us: By that means we shall be able to put them off insensibly when over God calls for them, or perhaps we shall prevent his calling for them at all, it being for the most part our too close ad∣herence to them which prompts sum to it.</P>
<P N="9">A third advantage of affliction is, that it is a mark and signature of our adoption, witness of our legitimation. <HI>What son is he</HI> (faith the apostle) <HI>whom the Father chastiseth not? but if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons,</HI> Heb. xii. 7, 8. <HI>Jacob</HI> clad his darling <HI>Joseph</HI> in a party-coloured coat, and God's favour∣ites do here wear a livery interwoven with a mixture of dark and gloomy colours; their <HI>long white robes</HI> are laid up for them against they come to the <HI>marriage of the Lamb,</HI> Rev. xix. 7. Indeed we much mistake the design of Christianity, if we think it calls us to a condition of ease and security. It might suit well enough with
<PB N="140" REF="031170_0139_0FEB14AF8C7A5218"/>
the votaries of the golden calf, to <HI>sit down to eat and drink, and rise up to play,</HI> Exod. xxxii. 6. but the disciples of the crucified Saviour are trained to another discipline, our profession enters us into a state of warfare, and accordingly our very bap∣tismal engagement runs all in military terms, and we are not only servants of Christ's family, but soldiers of his camp. Now we know in a war men must not ex∣pect to pass their time in ease and softness, but besides all the dangers and difficul∣ties of the combat, have many other hard∣ships to endure; hunger and thirst, heat and cold, hard lodgings and weary marches: and he that is too nice for those, will not long stick to his colours. And it is the same in our spiritual war∣fare; many pressures and sufferings are annexed to it, and our passive valour is no less tried than our active. In respect of this it is that our Saviour admonishes his proselytes to compute first the difficulties incident to their profession, and that he may not ensnare us by proposing too easy terms, he bids us reckon upon the worst, and tells us, that he <HI>that forsakes not all that he hath, shall not be his disciple</HI> Luke xiv. 26. <HI>and that we must through much tri∣bulation enter into the kingdom of God.</HI> Acts xiv. 22. Indeed, it were very absurd for us to expect, easier conditions, when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se
<PB N="141" REF="031170_0140_0FEB14B2802D41F0"/>
are the same to which our Leader has submitted. The <HI>Captain of our salvation was perfected by sufferings,</HI> Heb. ii. 10. <HI>and if it behoved Christ to suffer before he enter∣ed into his glory,</HI> Luke xxiv. 46. it were insolent madness for us to look to be car∣ried thither upon our beds of ivory, or from the noise of our harps and viols, be immediately rapt into the choir of an∣gels.</P>
<P N="10">This hath been so much considered by pious men, that they have looked upon their secular prosperities with fear and jea∣lousy, and many have solemnly petitioned for crosses, as thinking them the necessa∣ry attestation of their sonship, and means of assimulation to their elder brother. Why then should that which is so desira∣ble to them, appear so formidable to us? or why should we so vehemently deprecate what they so earnestly invited? If we in∣deed think it a privilege to be the sons of God, and fellow heirs with Christ, why do we grudge at the condition? The Ro∣man captain tells St. <HI>Paul,</HI> that he ob∣tained the immunities of a Roman <HI>with a great sum,</HI> Acts xxii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. and shall we ex∣pect so much a nobler and more advanta∣geous adoption perfectly gratis? Lock that God should change his whole econo∣my for our ease, give us an eternal inhe∣ritance,
<PB N="142" REF="031170_0141_0FEB14B558DD3818"/>
discharged of those temporal in∣cumbrances himself has annexed to it? This were sure as unjust a hope, as it would be a vain one. When <HI>David</HI> had that ensnared proposal made him, of be∣ing the king's son-in-law, 1 Sam. xviii. 11. he set such a value upon the dignity, that he despised the difficulty of the con∣dition: And sure we must have very low abject souls, if when so infinitely a higher advancement is sincerely offered us, we can suffer any apprehension of hardship to divert us. In a word, let us remember that of the apostle, <HI>if we suffer, we shall also reign with him,</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 12. And though our afflictions be in themselves not joyous but grievous, yet when they are considered as the earnest of our future inheritance, they put on another face, and may rather enamour that frighten us.</P>
<P N="11">A fourth advantage of afflictions is, that they excite our compassions towards others: There is nothing qualifies us so rightly to estimate the suffering of others, as the having ourselves felt them; with∣out this our apprehensions of them are as dull and confused, as a blind man is of colours, or a deaf man of sounds. They <HI>that stretch themselves upon their couches, that cat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; that chaunt to
<PB N="145" REF="031170_0142_0FEB14B824C3B288"/>
the sound of the vis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, drink wine in bowls, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves with the chief oint∣ments, will not much be grieved with the af∣flictions of Joseph,</HI> Amos vi. 4, 5, 6. Nay so necessary is our experience towards our commiseration, that we see it was thought a requisite accomplishment of our high-priest (that highest example of unbound∣ed compassion) and therefore saith the apostle, <HI>It behoved him in all things to be made like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-priest in things per∣taining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people, for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able also to suc∣cour them that are tempted,</HI> Heb. ii. 17, 18. But if he whose mere sense of our miseries brought him down to us, chose this expe∣dient to advance his pity, how necessary is it to our petrified bowels? And since God has assigned our mercies to our brethren as the standard by which he will proportion his to us, it is more ours than their advan∣tage to have them enlarged; so that when by making us taste of their cup, acquaint∣ing us with the bitter relish of their suf∣ferings; he prepares us to a christian sym∣pathy with them, it is but a remoter way of obliging and qualifying us for a more ample portion of his mercy. Nay besides the profit, there is honour accrues to us by it. Compassion is one of the best pro∣perties
<PB N="144" REF="031170_0143_0FEB14BAF1D13C20"/>
of our nature, and we unman our∣selves when we put it off; nay more, it is an attribute of the divinity, and the more we advance in it, the closer ap∣proaches we make to him. And there∣fore we have all reason to bless him for that discipline by which he promotes us in to excellent, so necessary a grace.</P>
<P N="12">A fifth benefit of affliction, is, that it is an improvement of devotion, sets us with more heartiness to our prayers. Whilst prosperity flows in upon us, we bathe ourselves in its streams, but are very apt to forget its source; so that God is fain to stop the current, leave us dry and parched, that our needs may make us do what our gratitude would not, trace our blessings up to the original spring, and both acknowledge and invoke him as the author of all our good. This effect of afflictions is observed by the Prophet, <HI>Lord, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them,</HI> Isa. xxvi. 16. And I believe I may appeal to every man's experience, whether his prayers be not more frequent and more hearty too, when he is under some distress. They how importunate are we in our petitions? how profuse in our vows and promises? saying with <HI>Is∣rael, Deliver us only we pray thee this day:
<PB N="145" REF="031170_0144_0FEB14BE0A729B38"/>
and they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord,</HI> Jud. x. 15, 16. I confess, it is no good indica∣tion of our temper, that we need thus to be put in the press e're we will yield any thing; yet since we are so disingenuous, it is a mercy in God to adapt his methods to us, to extort when we will not give; and if he can have no free-will-offerings, yet at least to exact his tribute. Nor does he design the effect of this should cease with the calamity that raised it, but expects our compelled addresses should bring us into the way of voluntary ones, and happily ensnare us into piety. And indeed herein we are worse than brutish if it do not. We think it a barbarous rudeness to engage a man in our affairs, and as soon as we have served our own turns, never take farther notice of him. Nay indeed the very beasts may lecture us in this piece of morality, many of them paying a signal gratitude, where they have received benefits; and shall we not come up at least to their pitch! shall not the endearment of our deliverance bring our Deliverer into some repute and consideration with us, and make us desire to keep up an acquaintance and intercourse with him? Yet if ingenuity work not with us, let interest at least prevail, and the
<PB N="146" REF="031170_0145_0FEB14C1023E5358"/>
remembrance how soon we may need him again, admonish us not to make ourselves strangers to him. God complains of <HI>Israel, Wherefore say my people, we are Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we will come no more at thee,</HI> Jer. ii. 31. A very insolent folly to renounce that de∣pendance by which alone they subsisted, and no less will it be in any of us if we stop our recourse to him because we have had advantage by it. We have no assur∣ance that the same occasion shall not oc∣cur, but with what face can we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that intercourse which in the interval we despised? So that if we have but any or∣dinary providence we shall still so cele∣brate past rescues, as to continue in a ca∣pacity of begging more, and then we can∣not but also confess the benefit of those first calamities which inspirited our devo∣tion, and taught us to pray in earnest, and will be ashamed that our thanks should be uttered in a fainter accent than our peti∣tions; or our daily spiritual concerns should be more coldly solicited than our temporal accidental ones.</P>
<P N="13">Nor is it only our devotion that is thus improved by our distresses, but ma∣ny other graces; our faith, our hope, our patience, our Christian sufferance and for∣titude. It is no triumph of faith to trust God for those good things which he gives
<PB N="147" REF="031170_0146_0FEB14C4F79F45E8"/>
us in hand, this is rather to walk by sens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than faith; but to rely on him in the greatest destitution, <HI>and against hope to be∣lieve in hope,</HI> this is the saith of a true child of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and will be <HI>imputed</HI> to us (as it was to him) <HI>for righteousness,</HI> Rom. iv. 23, 24. So also our patience owes all its opportunities of exercise to our afflictions, and consequently owes al∣so a great part of its being to them, for we know desuetude will lose habits. What imaginable use is there of patience, where there is nothing to suffer? In our prosper∣ous state we may indeed employ our tem∣perance, our humility, our caution; but patience seems then an useless virtue: Nay indeed, for ought we know, may be counterfeit, till adversity bring it to the test. And yet this is the most glorious accomplishment of a Christian, that which most eminently conforms him to the image of his Saviour, whose whole life was a perpetual exercise of this grace; and therefore we love our ease too well if we are unwilling to buy this pearl at any price.</P>
<P N="14">Lastly, Our thankfulness is (at least ought to be) increased by our dis∣tresses. It is very natural for us to reflect with value and esteem upon those bles∣sings we have lost, and we too often do
<PB N="148" REF="031170_0147_0FEB14C69D434D70"/>
it to aggravate our discontent: But sure, the most rational use of it is to raise our thankfulness for the time wherein we en∣joyed them. Nay not only our former enjoyments, but even our present depri∣vations deserve our gratitude, if we consider the happy advantages we may reap from them. If we will perversely cast them away, that unworthy contempt pays no scores, for we still stand answerable in God's account for the good he designed, and we might have had by it, and we be∣come liable to a new charge for our ingra∣titude in thus <HI>despising the chastisement of the Lord,</HI> Heb. xii. 5.</P>
<P N="15">And now if all these benefits of af∣flictions (which are yet but imperfectly re∣cited) may be thought worth considering, it cannot but reconcile us to the sharpest of God's methods; unless we will own ourselves such mere animals, as to have no other apprehensions than what our bo∣dily senses convey to us. For sure, he that has reason enough to understand that he has an immortal soul, cannot but as∣sent that its interests should be served, though with displacency of his flesh. Yet even in regard of that, our murmur∣ings are oft very unjust, for we do many times ignorantly prejudge God's designs towards us even in temporals, who fre∣quently

makes a little transient uneasiness, the passage to secular felicities. <HI>Moses</HI> when he fled our of <HI>Egypt,</HI> probably little thought that he should return thither a <HI>God unto Pharaoh,</HI> Exod. iv. 16. and as lit∣tle did <HI>Joseph</HI> when he was brought thi∣ther a slave, that he was to be a ruler there; yet as distant as those states were, the divine Providence has so connected them, that the one depends upon the other. And certainly we may often observe the like over-ruling hand in our own distress∣es, that those events which we have enter∣tained with the greatest regret, have in the consequences been very beneficial to us.</P>
<P N="16">To conclude, we have certainly both from speculation and experience, a∣bundant matter to calm all our disquiets, to satisfy our distrusts, and to fix in us an entire resignation to God's disposals, who has designs which we cannot penetrate, but none which we need fear, unless we ourselves pervert them. We have our Sa∣viour's word for it, that <HI>he will not give us a stone when we ask bread, nor a scorpion when we ask a fish,</HI> Matth. vii. 9. Nay his love secures us yet farther from the errors of our own wild choice, and does not give us those stones and scorpions which we

importune for. Let us then leave our con∣cerns to him who best knows them, and make it our sole care to entertain his dis∣pensations with as much submission and duty, as he dispenses them with love and wisdom. And if we can but do so, we may dare all the power of earth and hell too, to make us miserable: For be our af∣flictions what they can, we are sure they are but what we in some respect or other need; be they privative or positive, the want of what we wish, or the suffering of what we wish not, they are the disposals of him who cannot e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and we shall fi∣nally have cause to say with the Psalmist, <HI>It is good for me that I have been afflicted,</HI> Psal. cxix. 71.</P>

<HEAD>Of our Misfortunes compared with other Men's.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to impress an equally just and useful consideration, the com∣paring of our misfortunes with those of other men: and he that does that, will certainly see so little cause to think himself singular, that he will not find himself su∣perlative in calamity; for there is no man living, that can with reason affirm himself to be the very unhappiest man, there be∣ing innumerable distresses of others which he knows not of, and consequently can∣not bring them in balance with his own. A multitude of men there are, whose per∣sons he knows not, and even of those he does, he may be much a stranger to their distresses; many sorrows may lie at the heart of him who carries a smiling face, and many a man has been an object of en∣vy to those who look but on the surface of his state, who yet to those who know his private griefs appears more worthy of compassion. And sure this confused un∣certain estimate of other men's afflictions, may divert us from all loud outcries of our own. <HI>Solon</HI> seeing a friend much opprest with grief, carried him up to a town that
<PB N="152" REF="031170_0151_0FEB14D222C2C9D8"/>
overlooked the city of <HI>Athens,</HI> and shew∣ing him all the buildings, said to him, Consider how many sorrows have, do, and shall in future ages inhabit under all those roofs, and do not vex thyself with those inconveniencies which are common to mortality, as if they were only yours. And sure it was good advice, for suffering is al∣most as inseparable and adjunct of our na∣ture, as dying is; yet we do not see men very apt to embitter their whole lives by the foresight that they must die, but see∣ing it a thing as universal as inevitable, they are more forward to take up the epi∣cure's resolution, <HI>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 32. And why should we not look upon afflictions also as the common lot of humanity, and as we take the advantages, so be content to bear the incumbrances of that state?</P>
<P N="2">But besides that allowance that is thus to be made for the unknown calamities of o∣thers, if we survey but those that lie open &amp; visible to us, the most of us shall find e∣nough to discountenance our complaints. Who is there that when he most studiou∣sly recollected his miseries, may not find some or other that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apparently equals, if not exceeds him? He that grieves at his being contemned and slighted, may see
<PB N="153" REF="031170_0152_0FEB14D4F65ACB80"/>
another persecuted and oppressed. He that groans under some sharp pain, may see another afflicted with sharper; and e∣ven he that has the most acute torments in his body, may see another more sadly cruciated by the agonies of his mind. So that if we would but look about us, we should see so many foreign occasions of our pity, that we should be ashamed to confine it wholly to ourselves.</P>
<P N="3">It will perhaps be said, that this can∣not be universally true, for that there must in comparative degrees be some lowest state of misery; I grant it, but still that state consists not in such an indivisible point, that any one person can have the enclosure; or if it do, it will be so hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any to discern who that one person is, that I need to desire no fairer a compositi∣on, than to have every man suspend his repinings, 'till he can evince his title. But alas! there are but few that can make any approaches to such a pretence: For though if we advert to men's complaints, we should think all degrees of comparison were confounded, and every man were equally the greatest sufferer; yet certainly in the truth of things it is nothing so; for (not to repeat what was before mentioned, that probably no man is miserable in any proportion to the utmost degree of possibi∣lity)
<PB N="154" REF="031170_0153_0FEB14D80FD52578"/>
the remarkably unhappy are very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the less number. And how passionate∣ly soever man exaggerate their calamities, yet perhaps in their sober mood, they will scarce change states with those whom they profess to think happier than them∣selves. It was the saying of Socrates, that if there were a common bank made of all men's troubles, most men would rather chuse to take those they brought, that to venture upon a new dividend. And indeed he had reason for his supposi∣tion; for considering how great a part of many man's afflictions are of their own making, fictitious and imaginary, they may justly fear least they should exchange feathers for lead, their own empty sha∣dows for their real and pressing calamities of others, and cannot but think it best to sit down with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir own, which serves their declamation as well, and their ease much better. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> see men at a little misshaping of a garment, a scarce discern∣able error in their cook, or their shortest interruption in their sports, in such trans∣ports of trouble, as if they were the most unfortunate men in the world; yet for all that, you shall hardly persuade them to change with him whose course clothing supersedes all care of the fashion, whose appetite was never disappointed for want of sauce, and whose perpetual toil makes him
<PB N="153" REF="031170_0154_0FEB14DC09996D90"/>
insensible what the defeat of sport sig∣nifies.</P>
<P N="4">Nay even where the exchange seems more equal, where the afflictions are on both sides solid and substantial, yet a pru∣dent man would scarce venture upon the barter. It is no small advantage to know what we have to contest with, to have ex∣perienced the worst of its attacks, by which we become better able to guard ourselves: But a new evil comes with the force of a surprise, and finds us open and disarmed. It is indeed almost a mi∣raculous power that custom has in recon∣ciling us to things otherwise displeasing; all our senses are taught to remit of their adversion by familiarity with ungrateful objects; that ugly form which at first makes us start, by use divests its terror, and we reconcile ourselves to harsh sounds and ill relishes by long custom. And sure it has the very same effect upon our minds, the most fierce calamities do by acquaint∣ance grow more tractable, so that he that exchanges an old one for a new, does but bring a wild lion into his house instead of a tame: It may for ought he knows im∣mediately tear him in pieces, but at least must cost him a great deal of pains to ren∣der it gentle and familiar, and certainly no wise man would wish to make such a bargain.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="156" REF="031170_0155_0FEB14DDAB07E650"/>
By all this it appears that how extra∣vagantly soever we aggravate our own ca∣lamities and extenuate other men's▪ we dare not upon recollection stand to our own es∣timate, and what can be said more in pre∣judice of our discontents? It is a grant∣ed maxim, that every man must have af∣flictions, <HI>Man that is born of a woman,</HI> says Job, <HI>is of few years, and full of trou∣ble,</HI> Job xiv. 1. And we must reverse God's fundamental law, before we can hope for a total exemption. All that any man can aspire to, is to have but an equal share with others, and the generality of men have so, at least none can prove he has not so; and till he can, his murmurs will surely be very unjustifiable, especially when they have this convincing circum∣stance against them, that he dares not up∣on sober thoughts change his afflictions with most of his neighbours. He is an ill member of a commnnity, who in public assessments would shuffle off all payments; and he is no better, who in this common tax God has laid upon our nature, is not content to bear his share.</P>
<P N="6">And truly would we but consider that in all our sufferings nothing befalls us but what is common to our kind, nay, which is extremely exceeded by many within the verge of our own observation,
<PB N="157" REF="031170_0156_0FEB14E0812F0E08"/>
we must be senselesly partial to be impa∣tient. The Apostle thought it a compe∣tent consolation for the first christians, that <HI>there had no temptation befallen them but what was common to men,</HI> 1 Cor. x. 13. and we betray very extravagant opinions of ourselves if it be not so to us. Indeed it is scarce possible for us to be so unsatisfied as the greatest part of us are, did we in the comparing ourselves with others, proceed with any tolerable ingenuity.</P>
<P N="7">But alas we are very fallacious and deceitful in the point, we do not compare the good of others with our good, nor their evil with our evil; but with an en∣vious curiosity we amass together all the desirable circumstances of our neighbours condition, and with as prying discontent we ransack all our grievances, and con∣front to them. This is so insincere a way of proceeding, as the most ordinary un∣derstanding can detect. If I should wa∣ger that my arm were longer than another man's, and for trial measure my arm with his finger, he must be stupidly silly, that should award me for it: and yet this were not a grosser cheat, than that which we put upon ourselves, in our comparisons with others. And it is a little strange to observe unto what various purposes we
<PB N="158" REF="031170_0157_0FEB14E3935FD2D8"/>
can apply this one thin piece of sophistry, for when we compare our neighbours and ourselves in point of morality, we do but reverse the fallacy, and presently make his vices as much exceed ours, as our calami∣ties did his in the other instance. They are indeed both great violences to reason and justice, yet the latter is sure the plea∣santer kind of deceit. A man has some joy in thinking himself less wicked than his neighbour, but what imaginable com∣fort can he take in thinking himself more miserable? Certainly he that would sub∣mit to a cousenage, had much better shift the scene, and think his sufferings less than they are, rather than more: for since opi∣nion is the thing that usually sets an edge upon our calamities, it might be a profit∣able deceit that could steal that from us.</P>
<P N="8">But we need not blindfold ourselves if we would but use our eyes aright, and see things in their true shapes; and if we did thus, what a strange turn would there be in the common estimates of the world? How many of the gilded troubles of great∣ness, which men at a distance look on with so much admiration and desire, would then be as much contemned as now they are courted? A competency would then get the better of abundance, and the now en∣vied pomp of princes, when balanced with
<PB N="159" REF="031170_0158_0FEB14E78E2191A8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cares and hazards annexed would be to far from a bait, that men like <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al</HI> 1 Sam. x. 22. would <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves</HI> from the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rment; and he that understood the weight, would rather chuse to wield a slail than a sceptre: Yet so childishly are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> besotted with the glittering appearance of things, that we conclude felicity must needs dwell where there is a magnificent portico, and being possessed with this fan∣cy we overlook her in our own humbler cottages, where she would more constant∣ly reside, if she could but find us at home; but we are commonly engaged in a ram∣bling pursuit of her where she is most sel∣dom to be found, and in the interim, miss of her at her own doors.</P>
<P N="9">Indeed there is scarce a greater fol∣ly or unhappiness incident to man's na∣ture, than this fond admiration of other men's enjoyments, and contempt of our own. And whilst we have that humour, it will supplant not only our present, but all possibilities of our future content: For though we could draw to ourselves all those things for which we envy others, we should no sooner have made them our own, than they will grow despicable and nauseous to us. This is a speculation which has been attested by innumerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> being nothing more
<PB N="160" REF="031170_0159_0FEB14E92ED8C858"/>
frequent, than to see men with impatient eagerness, nay often with extreme ha∣zards, pursue those acquests, which when they have them, they are immediately sick of. There is scarce any man that may not give himself instances of this in his own particular; and yet so fatally stupid are we, that no defeats will discipline us, or take us off from the false estimates of other men's happiness. And truly while we state our comparisons so unequally, they are as mischievous as the common proverb states them odious: But if we would begin at the right end, and look with as much compassion on the adversi∣ties of our brethren, as we do with envy on their prosperities, every man would find cause to sit down contentedly with his own burden, and confess that he bears but the proportionable share of his com∣mon nature, unless perhaps it be where some extraordinary demerits of his own have added to the weight; and in that case he has more reason to admire his af∣flictions are so few, than so many. And certainly every man knows so many more ills by himself, than it is possible for him to do by another, that he that really sees himself exceed others in his sufferings, will find cause enough to think he does in sin also.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="161" REF="031170_0160_0FEB14EC21D04BB8"/>
But if we stretch the comparison beyond our cotemporaries, and look back to the generations of old, we shall have yet farther cause to acknowledge God's great indulgence to us. <HI>Abraham</HI> though the friend of God, was not exempted from severe trials; he was first made to wander from his country, and betake himself to a kind of vagrant life, was a long time suspended from the blessings of his desir∣ed offspring, and when at last his beloved <HI>Isaac</HI> was obtained, it caused a domestic jar, which he was fain to compose by the expulsion of <HI>Ishmael,</HI> though his son also. But what a contest may we think there was in his own bowels, when that rigor∣ous task was imposed on him of sacrificing his <HI>Isaac?</HI> and though his faith gloriously triumphed over it, yet sure there could not be a greater pressure upon human na∣ture. <HI>David</HI> the man after God's own heart, is no less signal for his afflictions than for his piety, he was for a great while an exile from his country, and (which he most bewailed) form the sanc∣tuary, by the persecutions of <HI>Saul:</HI> and after he was settled in that throne to which God's immediate assignation had entitled him, what a succession of calami∣ties had he in his own family? the inces∣tuous rape of his daughter, the retalia∣tion
<PB N="162" REF="031170_0161_0FEB14EF193FC690"/>
of that by the unnatural murder of <HI>Amnon,</HI> and that seconded by another no less barbarous conspiracy of <HI>Absalom</HI> a∣gainst himself, his expulsion from <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> the base revilings of <HI>Shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i,</HI> and fi∣nally the loss of that darling son in the act of his sin. A cluster of afflictions, in comparison whereof the most of ours are but like the <HI>gleanings</HI> (as the prophet speaks) <HI>after the vintage is done.</HI> It were indeed endless to instance in all the seve∣ral forefathers of our faith before Christ's incarnation, the apostle gives us a brief, but very comprehensive compendium of their sufferings, <HI>They had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings; yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonments: they were stoned, were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented: they wandered in de∣serts, and in mountains, and in dens, and in caves of the earth,</HI> Heb. xi. 36, 37, 38. And if we look on the primitive Christi∣ans, we shall see them perfectly the coun∣terpart to them, their privileges consisted not in any immunities from calamities; for their whole lives were scenes of suffer∣ings. St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives us an account of his own, <HI>In labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, is

And if his single hardships rose thus high, what may we think the whole sum of all his fellow-labourers amounted to together, with that noble army of martyrs who sealed their faith with their blood; of whole sufferings ec∣clesiastic history gives us such astonishing relations.</P>
<P N="11">And flow being compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, the a∣postle's inference is very irrefragable, <HI>let us run with patience the race which is set be∣fore us,</HI> Heb. xii. 1, 2. But yet it is more so, if we proceed on to that consi∣deration he adjoins, <HI>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our saith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame,</HI> verse 3.

And as if he had charged himself with all our griefs as well as our sins, there is scarce any human calamity which we may not find exemplified in him. Does any complain of the lowness and poverty of

He was forced to be an inmate with the beasts, he laid in a sta∣ble at his birth, and after himself profes∣ses that he <HI>had not where to lay his head,</HI> Luke ix. 58. Is any opprest with infamy and reproach? he may see his savior ac∣cused as a <HI>glutton and a wine-bibber,</HI> Luke vii. 34. <HI>a blasphemer,</HI> John x. 33. <HI> a sor∣cerer,</HI> Mat. xii. 24. <HI>a perverter of the na∣tion,</HI> Luke xxiii. 2. Yea, to such a sor∣did lowness had they sunk his repute, that a seditious thief and murderer was thought the more eligible person, <HI>not this man but Barabbus,</HI> John xviii. 40.

Nay what is infinitely more than this, he seemed deserted by God also, as is witnessed by that doleful exclamation, <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</HI> Mat. xxvii. 46. Is any dissatisfied with his hardships or laboriousness of his
<PB N="165" REF="031170_0164_0FEB14F7CA361320"/>
life? let him remember his saviour's was not a life of delicacy or ease: He was ne∣ver entered in those academies of luxury, where men are <HI>gorgeously appareled and live delicately,</HI> Luke vii. 25. but he was brought up under the mean roof of a carpenter, and consequently subjected to all the low∣ness of such an education. His initiation to his prophetic office was with the mira∣culous severity of a forty days fast, and in his discharge of it, we find him in per∣petual labours, <HI>going about doing good,</HI> Acts x. 38. and that not in triumph, like a prince bestowing his gifts, but in weari∣some travels; never riding but once, and that only upon a borrowed beast, <HI>and to fulfil a prophecy,</HI> Mat, xxi. 4. 5. Does any man groan under sharp and acute pains? let him consider what his redeem∣er endured, how in his infancy, at his cir∣cumcision he offered the first fruits, as an earnest of that bloody vintage when <HI>he trod the wine press alone,</HI> Isai, lxiii. 3. Let him attend him through all the stages of direful passion, and behold his arms pini∣oned with rough cords, his head smote with a reed, and torn with his crown of thorns, his back ploughed with those <HI>long furrows,</HI> (Psal. cxx. 3.) the scourges had made; his macerated feeble body oppres∣sed with the weight of his cross, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t last racked and extended on it: his hands
<PB N="166" REF="031170_0165_0FEB14FAC6E916B8"/>
and feet, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se nervous and consequently most sensible parts tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sfixed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ails, his whole body fastened to that accursed tree, and exposed naked to the air in a cold season; his throat parched with thirst and yet more afflicted with that vinegar and gall wherewith they pretended to re∣lieve him: and finally his life expiring a∣midst the full sense of these accurate tor∣ments. Lastly, does any man labour un∣der the bitterest of all sorrows, importu∣nate temptations to, or a wounded spirit for sin? even here also he may find that he has an <HI>high priest who hath been touched with the sense of his infirmities,</HI> Heb. iv. 15. He was violently assaulted with a successi∣on of temptations, Mat. iv. and we cannot doubt but Satan would on him employ the utmost of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> skill. Nor was he less op∣pressed with the burden of his sin, (ours I mean) though not his own. What may we think were his apprehensions in the garden, when he so earnestly deprecated that which was his whole errand into the world? What a dreadful pressure was that, wrung from him that bloody sweat, and cast him into that inexplicable agony, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orrow whereof was beyond the compre∣hension of any but his who felt it? and fi∣nally how amazing was the sense of divine wrath, which extorted that stupendous complaint, that strong cry on the cross,

<HI>Heb.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 7. the sharp accent whereof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do aright sound on our hearts, must cer∣tainly quite overwelm our loudest groans? and now certainly I may say with Pilate, Ecce homo, behold the man, or rather with a more divine author, Behold <HI>If ever there were sorrows like unto his sorrow,</HI> Lam. i. 12.</P>
<P N="12">And sure it were but a reasonable inference, that which we find made by Christ himself, <HI>If these things be done in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</HI> Luke xxiii. 31. if an imputative guilt could nourish so scorching a flame, pull down so severe a wrath, what can we ex∣pect who are merely made up of combus∣tible matter, whose proper personal sins cry for vengeance? Sure were we to judge by human measures, we should reckon to have more than a double portion of our Saviour's sufferings entailed upon us: yet such is the efficacy of his, that they have commuted for ours, and have left us only such a share, as may evidence our relation to our crucified Lord; such as may serve only for badges and cognizances to whom we pertain. For alas! let the most af∣flicted of us weigh our sorrows with his, how absurdly unequal will the comparison appear? And therefore as the best expe∣dient to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our mutinies, to shame us

out of our repinings, let us often draw this uneven parallel, confront our petty uneasiness with his unspeakable tor∣ments; and sure it is impossible but our admiration and gratitude must supplant our impatience.</P>
<P N="13">This is indeed the method to which the Apostle directs us, <HI>Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and saint in your minds, ye have not yet resisted unto blood,</HI> Heb. xii. 3. Was he contradicted, and shall we expect to be humoured and com∣plied with? Did he resist to blood, and shall we think those pressures intolerable, with force only a few tears from us? This is such an unmanly niceness, as utterly makes us unfit to follow the captain of our salvation. What a soldier is he like to make, that will take no share of the ha∣zards and hardships of his general? Ho∣nest <HI>Uriah</HI> would not take the lawful so∣laces of his own house, upon the conside∣ration that his lord <HI>Joab</HI> though but his fellow subject) <HI>lay encamped in the open fields,</HI> 2 Sam. xi. 11 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yea though he was sent by him from the camp. And shall we basely forsake ours in pursuit of our case? He is of a dangerous spirit, whom the example of his superior will not ani∣mate. <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Cato</HI> march∣ing

And surely we extremely discredit our in∣stitution, if we cannot equal their ingenu∣ity; and follow ours with as great alacri∣ty through all the difficulties he has traced before us, and for us.</P>
<P N="14">Nor let us think to excuse ourselves upon the impotency of our flesh, which wants the assistance which his divinity gave him: For that plea is superseded by the fore-mentioned examples of the saints, men of like passions with us, who not only patiently, but joyfully endured all tribu∣lations; by which it appears it is not im∣possible to our nature, with those aids of grace which are common to us with them: for certainly the difference between them and us, is not so much in the degrees of the aids, as in the diligence of employing them. Let us therefore, as the apostle advises, <HI> lift up the hands which hang <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the feeble knees,</HI> Heb. xii. 12. and with a noble emulation follow those heroic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣terns

they have set us. And since we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that even those favourites of heaven, have smarted so severely, let us never dream of an immunity; but when ever we find ourselves inclining to any such flattering hope, let every one of us upbraid ourselves in those terms the Jews did our Saviour, <HI>Art thou greater than Abraham, and the Prophets, whom makest thou thyself?</HI> John viii. 53. Nay we may descend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower and take in not only all the inferior saints of former times, but all those our contem∣poraries in sufferings, which are the most within our view, and may ask the apostles question, <HI>what then? are we better than they?</HI> Rom. iii. 9. If we think we are, it is certain we are so much worse by that insolence; and if we confess we are not, upon what score can we pretend to be better treated? To conclude, let us not pore only upon our peculiar evils, but at∣tentively look about us, and consider what others endure: and since in frolics we can sport ourselves with many uneasiness∣es for company sake, let us not be more pusillanimous in our soberer moods, but every man cheerfully take his turn in bearing the common burden of mortality, till we put off both it and its appendages together, when this mortal shall put on immortality, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 54.</P>

<HEAD>Of Particular Aids for the gaining of Content∣ment.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now passed through all those considerations we at first proposed, and may trust the considering reader to make his own collections: yet because impati∣ence is the vice that has been all this while arraigned, I am to foresee if possible, that those who have the greatest degree of that, may be the least willing to attend the whole process; and therefore I think it may not be amiss, for their ease to suit and reduce all into some short directions and rules for the acquiring contentment.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="172" REF="031170_0171_0FEB150A4B1182E8"/>
The first and most fundamental is, the mortifying our pride, which as it is the seminary of most sins, so especially this of repining. Men that are highly opi∣nioned of themselves are commonly unsa∣tisfiable: For how well soever they are treated, they still think it short of their merits. Princes have often experimented this in those who have done them signal services; but God finds it in those who have done him none, and we expect he shall dispense to us according to those false estimates we put upon ourselves. Therefore he that aspires to content, must first take truer measures of himself, and consider that as he was nothing till God gave him a being, so all that he can pro∣duce from that being, is God's by origi∣nal right, and therefore can pretend to nothing of reward; so that whatever he receives, is still upon the account of a new bounty; and to complain that he has no more, is like the murmurs of an un∣thankful debtor, who would still increase those scores which he knows he can never pay.</P>
<P N="3">In the second place, let every man consider how many blessings (notwith∣standing his having no claim to any) he daily enjoys; and whether those he so im∣patiently raves after, be not much inferior
<PB N="173" REF="031170_0172_0FEB150BEBF9FAF8"/>
to them. Nay let him ask his own heart whether he would quit all those he has, for them he wants; and if he would not (as I suppose no man in his wits would, those wits being part of the parter) let him then judge how unreasonable his re∣pinings are, when himself confesses he has the better part of worldly happiness, and never any man living had all.</P>
<P N="4">In the third place therefore let him secure his duty of thankfulness for those good things he hath, and that will insensi∣bly undermine his impatiencies for the rest, it being impossible to be at once thankful and murmuring. To this purpose it were very well, if he would keep a solemn catalogue of all the boun∣ties, protections, and deliverances he has received from God's hand, and every night examine what accessions that day has brought to the sum: And he that did this, would undoubtedly find so many in∣citations to gratitude, that all those to dis∣content would be stifled in the croud. And since acknowledgement of God's mercies is all the tribute he exacts for them, we must certainly look on that as an indispensable duty: And therefore he that finds that God shortens his hand, stops the efflux of his bounty towards
<PB N="174" REF="031170_0173_0FEAE55BC76E5030"/>
him, should reflect on himself whether he be not behind in that homage by which he holds, and have not by his unthankful∣ness <HI>turned away good things from him,</HI> Isai. lix. 1. And if he find it so (as who alas is there that may not!) he cannot sure for shame complain, but must in prudence re∣inforce his gratitude for what is left, as the best means to recover what he has lost.</P>
<P N="5">But his murmurs will yet be more amazingly silenced, if in the fourth place he compares the good things he enjoys with the ill he has done. Certainly this is a most infallible cure for our impatien∣cies, the holiest man living being able to accuse himself of such sins, as would ac∣cording to all human measures of equity forfeit all blessings, and pull down a great∣er weight of judgment than the most mi∣serable groan under. Therefore as be∣fore I advised to keep a catalogue of be∣nefits received, so here it would be of use to draw up one of sins committed. And doubtless he that confronts the one with the other, cannot but be astonished to find them both so numerous, equally wondering at God's mercy in continuing his blessings, in despite of all his provoca∣tions, and at his own baseness in continu∣ing his provocations in despite of all those
<PB N="175" REF="031170_0174_0FEB1511BAB25630"/>
blessings. Indeed it is nothing but our affected ignorance of our demerits, that makes it possible for us to repine un∣der the severest of God's dispensations. Would we but ransack our hearts, and see all the abominations that lie there, nay would the most of us but recollect those barefaced crimes which even the world can witness against us, we should find more than enough to balance the heaviest of our pressures. When therefore by our impatient strugglings we fret and gall our∣selves under our burdens, let us interro∣gate our souls in the words of the pro∣phet, <HI>Why doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sin?</HI> Let us not spend our breath in murmurs and outcries, which will only serve to provoke more stripes: But <HI>let us search and try our ways, and</HI> turn <HI>again to the Lord,</HI> Lam. iii. 39, 43. diligently seek out <HI>that accursed thing</HI> which has caused our discomfiture, and by the removal of that, prepare the way for the access of mercy. But alas how preposterous a method do we take in our afflictions! We accuse every thing but what we ought, furiously fly at all the second causes of our calamity, nay too often at the first, by impious disputes of providence, and in the mean time, as <HI>Job</HI> speaks, <HI>the root of the matter is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in us,</HI> Job xix. 28. We shelter and pro∣tect
<PB N="176" REF="031170_0175_0FEB1515B5A48370"/>
in our bosoms the real author of our miseries. The true way then to allay the sense of our sufferings, is to sharpen that of our sins. The prodigal thought the meanest condition in his father's family a preferment, <HI>Make me one of thy hired ser∣vants,</HI> Luke xv. 19. And if we have his penitence, we shall have his submission al∣so, and calmly attend God's disposals of us.</P>
<P N="6">As every man in his afflictions is to look inward on his own heart, so also up∣ward and consider by whose providence all events are ordered. <HI>Is there any evil</HI> (i. e. of punishment) <HI>in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> Amos iii. 6. and what are we worms that we should dispate with him? Shall a man contend with his maker? Let the <HI>potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth,</HI> Isa. xlv. 9. And as his power is not to be controlled, so nei∣ther is his justice to be impeached, <HI>Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?</HI> Gen. xviii. 25. And where we can neither re∣sist nor appeal, what have we to do but humbly to submit? Nor are we only com∣pelled to it by necessity, but induced and invited by interest, since his dispensations are directed not barely to assert his, domi∣nion, but to evidence his paternal care over us. He discerns our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and accord∣ingly,
<PB N="177" REF="031170_0176_0FEB15175B115240"/>
applies to us. The benignity of his nature permits him not to take delight in our distresses, <HI>he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men,</HI> Lam. iii. 33. and therefore whenever he administers to us a bitter cup, we may be sure the ingredi∣ents are medicinal, and such as our infir∣mities require. He dares not trust our in∣temperate appetites with unmixed prospe∣rities, the lusciousness whereof, though it may please our palates, yet like St. <HI>John's</HI> book, Rev. x. 9. that <HI>honey in the mouth may prove gall in the bowels,</HI> ingender the most fatal diseases. Let us therefore in our calamaties <HI>not consult with flesh and blood,</HI> Gal. i. 16. (which the more it is be∣moaned, the more it complains) but look to the hand that strikes; and assure our∣selves, that the stripes are not more severe, than he sees necessary to our good: And since they are so, they ought in reason to be our choice as well as his; and not only religion, but self-love will prompt us to say, with old <HI>Ely, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</HI> 1 Sam. iii. 18. But alas! we do not understand what is our in∣terest; because we do not rightly under∣stand what we are ourselves. We consi∣der ourselves merely in our animal being, our bodies and those sensitive faculties ves∣ted in them, and when we are invaded there, we think we are undone, though
<PB N="178" REF="031170_0177_0FEB151A2F0EC890"/>
that breach he only to relieve that diviner part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us, besieged and oppressed with the flesh about it. (for so God knows it too often is) or if we do not consider it in that notion of an enemy, yet at the ut∣most estimate, the body is to the soul but as the garment to the body, a decent case to cover: Now what man (not stark fran∣tic) would rather have his clothes cut than his flesh? and then by the rate of propor∣tion, we may well question our own sobri∣ety, when we repine that our souls are se∣cured at the cost of our bodies, and that is certainly the worst, the unkindest de∣sign; and our impatient resistances serve only to frustrate the kind, and medicinal part of affliction, but will not at all rescue us from the severe. Our murmurings may ruin our souls, but will never avert any of our outward calamaties.</P>
<P N="7">A seventh help to contentment is to have a right estimate of the world, and the common state of humanity: To consider the world but as a stage and ourselves but as actors, and to resolve that it is very lit∣tle material, what part we play so we do it well. A comedian may get as much ap∣plause by acting the slave as the conquer∣er, and he that acts the one to day, may to-morrow reverse the part, and personate the other. So great are the vicissitudes of the world, that there is no building any
<PB N="179" REF="031170_0178_0FEB151D44C48138"/>
firm hopes upon it. All the certainty we have of it, is, that in every condition is has its uneasiness; so that when we court a change we rather seek to vary than end our miseries. And certainly he that has well impressed upon his mind the vanity and vexation of the world, cannot be much surprised at any thing that befalls him in it. We expect no more of any thing but to do its kind, and we may as well be angry tkat we cannot bring the li∣ons to our cribs, or fix the wind to a cer∣tain point, as that we cannot secure our∣selves from dangers and disappointments, in this rough and mutable world. We are therefore to lay it as an infallible maxim, that in this vale of tears every man must meet with sorrows and disasters: And then sure we may take our peculiar with even∣ness of temper, as being but the natural consequent of our being men. And tho' possibly we may every one think himself to have a double portion, yet that is usually from the deceitful comparison we make of ourselves with others. We take the mag∣nifying glasses of discontent and envy, when we view our own miseries and others felicities, but look on our enjoyments and their sufferings through the contracting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of ingratitude and incomparison: And whilst we do thus, it is impossible but we must foment our own diss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>actions.
<PB N="180" REF="031170_0179_0FEB15213AD1C128"/>
He that will compare to good purpose must do it honestly and sincerely, and view his neighbors calamaties with the same at∣tention he does his own, and his own comforts with the same he does his neigh∣bors; and then many of the great seem∣ing inequalities would come pretty near a level.</P>
<P N="8">But even where they do not, it in the eighth place deserves however to be considered how illnatured a thing it is, for any man to think himself more miserable because another is happy; and yet this is the very thing, by which alone many men have made themselves wretched: For ma∣ny have created wants, merely from the envious contemplation of other men's a∣bundance. And indeed there is nothing more disingenuous, or (to go higher) more diabolical. Lucifer was happy enough in his original state, yet could not think him∣self so, because he was <HI>not like the most high,</HI> Isa. xiv. 14. And when by that insolent ambition he had forfeited bliss, it has ever since been an aggravation of his torment, that mankind is assumed to a capacity of it; and accordingly he makes it the de∣sign of his envious industry to defeat him. Now how perfectly are the two first parts of this copy transcribed, by those who first cannot be satisfied with any inferior
<PB N="181" REF="031170_0180_0FEB1522E15DE2A8"/>
degree of prosperity, and then whet their impatience with other mens enjoyments of what they cannot attain? And it is much to be doubted, that they who go thus far may complete their parallel, and endea∣vor when they have opportunity to un∣dermine that happiness they envy. There∣fore since Satan is so apt to impress his whole image, where he has drawn any li∣neament, it concerns us warily to guard ourselves, and by a christian sympathy with our brethren, <HI>rejoice with them that do rejoice,</HI> Rom. xii. 15. make the com∣forts of others an allay, not an improve∣ment of our own miseries. Charity has a strange magnetic power, and attracts the concerns of our brethren to us, and he that has that in his breast can never want refreshment, whilst any about him are hap∣py; for by adopting their interest, he shares in their joys. <HI>Jethro,</HI> though an a∣lien, <HI>rejoiced for all the good God had done to Israel,</HI> Exod. xviii. 9. and why should not we have as sensible a concurrence with our fellow christians? And he that has so, will still find something to balance his own suf∣ferings.</P>
<P N="9">Let him that aspires to contentment set bounds to his desire. It is our com∣mon fault in this affair, we usually be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="182" REF="031170_0181_0FEB1525B6B57A58"/>
at the wrong end, we <HI>enlarge our desires as hell, and cannot be satisfied,</HI> Hab. ii. 5. and then think God uses us ill, if he do not fill our insatiable appetites; Whereas if we would confine our expectations to those things which we need, or he has promis∣ed, there are few of us who would not find them abundantly answered. Alas! how few things are there which our na∣ture (if not stimulated by fancy and lux∣ury) requires? And how rare is it to find them who want those? Nay who have not many additionals for delight and plea∣sure? And yet God's promise under the gospel extends only to those necessaries; for when Christ assures his disciples that <HI>these things shall be added unto them,</HI> Mat. vi. 33. the content apparently restrains <HI>these things</HI> to meet and drink and cloth∣ing. Therefore take <HI>no thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he life what you shall eat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you drink, nor yet for the body what you shall put on,</HI> verse 25. now what pretence have we to claim more than our charter makes us? God never articled with the ambitious to give him honors, or with the covetous to fill his bags, or with the voluptuous to feed his luxuries. Let us therefore, if we expect to be satisfied, modestly confine our de∣sires within the limits he has set us: And then every accession which he superadds will appear (what it is) a mercy and
<PB N="183" REF="031170_0182_0FEB1528E705CEA0"/>
bounty. But whilst our appetites are boundless, and rather stretched than fill∣ed with our acquests, what possibility is there of their satisfaction? And when we importune God for it, we do but assign him such a task the poets made a repre∣sentation of their hell, the filling a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eve with water, or the rolling a stone up a precipice.</P>
<P N="10">A great expedient for contentment, is to confine our thoughts to the present, and not to let them loose to future events. Would we but do this, we might shake off a great part of our burden: For we of∣ten heap fantastic loads upon ourselves by anxious presages of things which perhaps will never happen, and yet sink more un∣der them, than under the real weight that is actually upon us; and this is certainly one of the greatest follies imaginable; for either the evil will come or it will not; if it will, it is sure no such desirable guest that we should go out to meet it, we shall feel it time enough when it falls on us, we not project to anticipate our sense of it; but if it will not, what extreme mad∣ness is it for a man to torment himself with that which will never be, to create engines of tortures, and by such aerial af∣flictions, make himself as miserable as the most real ones could do? and truly this
<PB N="184" REF="031170_0183_0FEAE5646F175028"/>
is all that we usually get by our foresights. Provision is one of God's attributes, and he mocks all our pretences to it, by a fre∣quent defeating of all our fore-casts. He does it often in our hopes: some little cross circumstance many times demolishes those goodly machines we raise to ourselves and he does it no less in our fears: Those ills we solemnly expected often baulk us, and others from an unexpected coast sud∣denly invade us. And since we are so blind, so short-sighted, let us never take upon us to be scouts, to discover danger at a distance (for it is manifold odds we shall only bring home false alarms) but let us rest ourselves upon that most admirable maxim of our blessed Lord, <HI>Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,</HI> Mat. vi. 34. ap∣ply ourselves with Christian courage to bear the present, and leave God either to augment or diminish, as he sees fit, for the future. Or if he will needs be look∣ing forward, let it be in obedience not in contradiction to our duty; let us enter∣tain ourselves with those futurities which we are sure are not chimeras, death and judgment, heaven and hell. The nearer we draw these things to our view, the more insensible will all intermediate ob∣jects be; they will deceive our sense of present, and much more forestall the ap∣prehension of future evils: For it is our
<PB N="185" REF="031170_0184_0FEB152CE3827058"/>
neglect of things eternal, that leaves us thus at leisure for the transitory.</P>
<P N="11">In the last place, let us in all our distresses supersede our anxieties and soli∣citudes by that most effectual remedy the apostle prescribes, <HI>Is any man afflicted let him pray,</HI> Jam. v. 13. And this sure is a most rational prescription: For alas! what else can we do towards the redress of our griefs. We who are so impotent, that we have not power over the most despicable excrescence of our own body, cannot make <HI>one hair white or black,</HI> Matth. v. 36. what can we do towards the new mould∣ing our condition, or modelling things without us? Our solicitudes serve only to bind our burdens faster upon us, but this expedient of prayer will certainly relieve us, <HI>Call upon me,</HI> says God, <HI>in the time of trouble, and I will hear thee, and thou shalt praise me,</HI> Psal. 1. 15. Whenever there∣fore we are sinking in the floods of afflic∣tion, let us thus support ourselves by re∣presenting our wants unto our gracious Lord, cry unto him a St. <HI>Peter</HI> did, <HI>Lord save me,</HI> Matt. xiv. 30. and he will take us by the hand, and be the winds never so boisterous or contrary, preserve us from sinking: The waves and billows of this troublesome world will serve but to toss
<PB N="186" REF="031170_0185_0FEB152E8ACF8460"/>
us closer into his arms, who can with a word appease the roughest tempest, or res∣cue us from it. Oh let us not then be so unkind to ourselves, as to neglect this infallible means of our deliverance! but with the psalmist take our refuge under the <HI>shadow of the divine wings till the cala∣mity be over past,</HI> Psal. lvii. 1. And as this is a sure expedient in all our real important afflictions, so is it a good test by which to try what are so. We are often peevish and disquieted at trifles, nay we take up the quarrels of our lusts and vice, and are discontented when they want their wished supplies. Now in either of these cases, no man that at all considers who he prays to, will dare to insert these in his prayers, it being a contempt of God to invoke him in things so slight as the one, or impious as the other. It will therefore be good for every man when he goes to address for relief, to consider what of his pressures they are that are worthy of that solemn deprecation: and when he has singled those out, let him reflect, and he will find he has in that prejudged all his other discontents as frivolous or wicked. And then sure he cannot think fit to harbour them, but must for shame dismiss them, since they are such as he dare not avow to him from whom alone he can expect relief. God always pities our real mise∣ries,
<PB N="187" REF="031170_0186_0FEB1531602848D8"/>
but our imaginary ones dare not de∣mand it. Let us not then create such diseases to ourselves, as we cannot declare to our physician: and when those are ex∣cluded, for all the rest St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s receipt is an universal medicine, <HI>Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayers and supplications, with thanksgiving, let your re∣quests be made known to God,</HI> Phil. 4. 6</P>

<HEAD>Of Resignation.</HEAD>
<P>AND now amidst such a variety of re∣ceipts, it will be hard to instance any one sort of calamity which can escape their efficacy, if they be but duly applied. But indeed we have generally a compendious way of frustrating all remedies by never making use of them: Like fantastic pa∣tients we are well enough content to have our dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase discoursed, and medicines pre∣scribed, but when the physic comes, have still some pretence or other to protract the taking it. But I shall beseech the reader to consider, that counsels are not charms, to work without any co-operation of the concerned person: They must be advert∣ed to, they must be pondered and consi∣dered, and finally they must be practised, or else the utmost good, they can do us, is to give us a few hours divertisement in the reading. But they do us a mischief that infinitely outweighs it, for they im∣prove our guilts by the ineffective tender they make of rescuing us from them, and leave us accountable not only for the o∣riginal crimes, but for our obstinate ad∣hesion to them in spite of admonition.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="189" REF="031170_0188_0FEB15384DEDFE88"/>
I say this because it is a little too no∣torious, that many take up books only as they do cards or dice, as an instrument of diversion. It is a good entertainment of their curiosity to see what can be said upon any subject, and be it well or ill-handled, they can please themselves equally with the ingenuity or rediculousness of the com∣posure, and when they have done this, they have done all they designed. This indeed may be tolerable in romances and play-books, but sure it ill benefits divinity. And yet I fear it oftenest happens there: for in the former some do project for some trivial improvements, as the embel∣lishing of their stile, the inspiriting of their fancies; and some men would scarce be able to drive their pedling trade of wit, did they not thus sweep the stage: but a∣las! how many books of piety are read, of which one cannot discern the least tincture in men's conversations, which sure does in a great measure proceed from the want of a determinate design in their reading, men's practice being not apt to be less ro∣vers than their speculation. He that takes a practical subject in hand, must do it with a design to conform his practice to what he shall there be convinced to be his duty, and he that comes not with this probity of mind, is not like to be much benefited by his reading.</P>

But one would think this should be an unnecessary caution at this time, for since the intent of this tract, is only to shew man the way to contentment, it is to be supposed the readers will be as much in earnest as the writer can be, it being every man's proper and most important interest, the instating him in the highest and most supreme felicity that this world can admit: yet for all this fair probabili∣ty, I doubt many will in this instance have the same indifference they have in their other spiritual concerns.</P>
<P N="4">It is true indeed that a quer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lous re∣pining humour, is one of the most perni∣cious, the most ugly habits incident to mankind; but yet as deformed people are oft the most in love with themselves, so this crooked piece of our temper is of all others the most indulgent to itself.

Their friends, their chil∣dren, their meat, their drink, every thing grows nauseous to them, and in a frantic discontent, they often sling away those things which they most value. Besides, this peevish impatience is of so aerial a diet, that it is scarce possible to starve it. It will nourish itself phantasms and chimeras, suborn a thousand surmises and imaginary distresses to abet its pretences: and though every one of us can remonstrate to ano∣ther, the unreasonableness of this discon∣tent; yet scarce any one of us will draw the argument home, or suffer ourselves to be convinced by what we urge as irrefra∣gable to others. Nay, farther, this hu∣mour is impatient of any diversion, loves to coverse only with itself. In bodily pains, men that despair of cure are yet glad of allays and mitigations, and strive by all arts, to divert and deceive the sense of their anguish; but in this disease of the mind, men cherish and improve their torment, roll and chew the bitter pill in their mouth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that they may be sure to have its utmost flavor; and by devoting all their thoughts to the subject of their grief, keep up an uninterrupted sense of it: as if they had the same tyranny for them∣selves which <HI>Caligula</HI> had for others, and
<PB N="192" REF="031170_0191_0FEB154011EE0AC8"/>
loved to feel themselves die. Indeed, there is not a more absurd contradiction in the world, than to hear men cry out, of the weight, the intolerableness of their burden, and yet grasp it as fast as if their life were bound up in it; will not depo∣sit it, no not for the smallest breathing time. A strange fascination sure, and yet so frequent, that it ought to be the fun∣damental care of him that would cure men of their discontents, to bring them to a herty willingness of being cured.</P>
<P N="5">It may be, this will look like para∣dox, and every man will be apt to say he wishes nothing more in earnest, that to be cured of his present discontent. He that is poor would be cured by wealth, he that is low and obscure by honour and great∣ness: But so an hydropic person may say he desires to have his thirst cured by a per∣petual supply of drink: yet all sober peo∣ple know, that this is the way only to en∣crease it; but let the whole habit of the body be rectified, and then the thirst will cease of itself. And certainly it is the ve∣ry same in the present case: No outward accessions will ever satisfy our cravings, our appetites must be tamed and reduced, and then they will never be able to arise tumults, or put us into mutiny or discon∣tent; and he (and none but he) that sub∣mits
<PB N="193" REF="031170_0192_0FEB15440E974678"/>
to this method, can truly be said to desire a cure.</P>
<P N="6">But he that thus attests the reality of his desires, and seeks contentment in its proper sphere, may surely arrive to some considerable degrees of it. We find in all ages men that only by the direction of natural light have calmed their disqui∣ets, and reasoned themselves into con∣tentment, even under great and sensible pressures; men who amidst the acutest torments have still preserved a serenity of mind, and have frustrated contempts and reproaches by disregarding them: and sure we give a very ill account of our Christianity, if we cannot do as much with it, as they did without it.</P>
<P N="7">I do not here propose such a stoical insensibility as makes no distinction of e∣vents, which, though it has been vainly pretended to by many, yet sure was never attained by any upon the strength of dis∣course. Some natural dullness or casual stupifaction must concur to that, and per∣haps by doing so, has had the luck to be canonized for virtue. I mean only such a superiority of mind as raises us above our sufferings though it exempts us not from the sense of them. We cannot pur∣pose
<PB N="194" REF="031170_0193_0FEB1546DB110420"/>
to ourselves a higher pattern in any virtue than our blessed Lord: Yet we see he not only felt that load under which he lay, but had the most pungent and quick sense of it, such as prompted those earnest deprecations, <HI>Father, if it be possible let this cup pass:</HI> Yet all those displacencies of his flesh were surmounted by the resignation of his spirit, <HI>nevertheless not what I will but what thou wilt,</HI> Luke xii. 42. And cer∣tainly he that in imitation of this pattern does in spite of all the reluctancies of his sense, thus entirely submit his will how∣ever he may be sad, yet he is not impa∣tient; nor is he like to be sad long, for to him that is thus resigned, <HI>light will spring up,</HI> Psal. xcvii. 11. some good angel will be lent like that to our Saviour to relieve his disconsolation. God will send either some outward allays, or give such interior comforts and supports, as shall counter∣poise those afflictions he takes not off.</P>
<P N="8">Indeed the grand design of God in correcting us, is (the same with that of a prudent parent towards his child) to break our wills. That stubborn faculty will scarce bend with easy touches, and there∣fore does require some force: And when by that rougher handling, he has brought it to a pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antness, the work is done. It is therefore our interest to co-operate with
<PB N="195" REF="031170_0194_0FEB154886471228"/>
this design, to assist as much as we are able towards the subjugating this unruly part of ourselves. This is that <HI>Sheba,</HI> 2 Sam. xx. 22. the surrendering of whom is God's expectation in all the close sieges he lays to us. Let us then be so wise, as by an early resigning it to divert his fur∣ther hostilities, and buy our peace with him.</P>
<P N="9">And truly this is the way not only to gain peace with him, but ourselves too: It is the usurpation of our will over our reason which breeds all the confusion and tumults within our own breasts, and there is no possibility of curbing its insolence, but by putting it into safe custody, com∣mitting it to him who (as our church teaches us) alone can order the unruly wills of sinful men. Indeed nothing but experience can fully inform us of the se∣renity and calm of that soul who has re∣signed his will to God. All care of chusing for himself is happily superseded, he is tempted to no anxious forecasts for future events, for he knows nothing can happen in contradiction of that supreme wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in which he hath sanctuary: Which will cer∣tainly chuse for him with that tenderness and regard, that a faithful guardian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for his pupil, or an indulgent father for his child that casts itself into his arms.
<PB N="196" REF="031170_0195_0FEB15E49B6F7000"/>
Certainly there is not in the world such a holy sort of artifice, so divine a charm to tie our God to us, as this of resigning ourselves to him. We find the Gibeon∣ites by yielding themselves vassals to the Israelites had their whole army at their back to rescue them in their danger, Josh. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 6, 7. and can we think God is less considerate of his homagers and depend∣ants? No certainly, his honour as well as his compassion is concerned in the relief of those who have surrendered themselves to him.</P>
<P N="10">Further yet, when by resignation we have united our wills to God, we have quite changed the scene, and we who when our wills stood single, were liable to perpetual defeats, in this blessed com∣bination can never be crossed. When our will is twisted and involved with God's, the same omnipotence which backs his will, does also attend ours. God's will, we are sure, admits of no controul, can never be resisted, and we have the fame security for ours, so long as it concurs with it. By this means all calamities are unfringed, and even those things which are most repugnant to our sensitive na∣tures, are yet very agreeable to our spirits, when we consider they are implicitly our own choice, since they are certainly
<PB N="197" REF="031170_0196_0FEAE57412FD6B70"/>
his, whom we have deputed to elect for us. Indeed there can be no face of adver∣sity so averting and formidable, which set in this light will not look amiable. We see daily how many uneasinesses and pre∣judices men will contentedly suffer in pur∣suit of their wills: And if we have really espoused God's, made his will ours, we shall with as great (nay far greater) ala∣crity embrace its distributions, how un∣easy soever to our sense; our souls will more acquiesce in the accomplishment of the divine will, than our flesh can reluct to any severe effects of it.</P>
<P N="11">Here then is that footing of firm ground, on which whosoever can stand, may indeed do that which <HI>Archimedes</HI> boasted, move the whole world. He may as to himself subvert the whole course, of sublunary things, unvenom all those cala∣mities which are to others the gall of asps; and in a further sense verify that evange∣lical prophecy, of <HI>beating swords into plow∣shares, and spears into pruning books,</HI> Isai. ii. 4. the most hostile weapons, the most adverse events, shall be by him converted into instruments of fertility, shall only ad∣vance his spiritual growth.</P>
<P N="12">And now who can chuse but con∣fess

this a much more eligible state, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to be always harrassed with solicitudes and cares, perpetually either fearing future defeats, or bewailing the past. And then what can we call it less than madness or enchantment, for men to act so contrary to their own dictates, yea to their very sense and experience, to see and acknow∣ledge the inexplicable felicity of a resign∣ed will, and yet perversely to hold ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> theirs, though they can get nothing by it, but the fullen pleasure of opposing God, and tormenting themselves? Let us there∣fore, if not for our duty or ease, yet at least for our reputation, the asserting our∣selves men of sobriety and common sense, do that which upon all these interests we are obliged; let us but give up our wills, and with them we shall certainly divest ourselves of all our fruitless anxieties, and cast our burdens upon him who invites us to do so. He who bears all our sins, will bear all our sorrows, our griefs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: If we will but be content to deposite them, he will relieve us from all those oppressing weights, which make <HI>our souls cleave to the dust,</HI> Psal, cxix. 25. and will in exchange give us only his <HI>light, his pleasant burden,</HI> Mat. 11. 30.

that <HI>all things shall work together for our good,</HI> Rom. viii. 28.</P>
<P N="13">To conclude, resignation and con∣tentment are virtues not only of a near cognation and resemblance, but they are linked as the cause and the effect. Let us but make sure of resignation, and content will flow into us without our further in∣dustry: As on the contrary, whilst our wills are at defiance with God's, we shall always find things at as great defiance with ours. All our subtilties or industries will never mould them to our satisfactions until we have moulded ourselves into that pliant temper that we can cordially say, <HI>It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good,</HI> 1 Sam. iii. 18.</P>

<HEAD>The CLOSE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS short institution of the <HI>Art of Contentment,</HI> cannot more naturally or more desirably draw to a conclusion, than in the resort we have given it, in the bo∣som of Divine Providence. The Roman conquerors, as the last pitch of their tri∣umphs, went to the capitol, and laid their garlands in the lap of <HI>Jupiter:</HI> But the Christian has an easier way to tri∣umph, to put his crown of thorns (for that is the trophy of his victories) within the arms of his gracious God; there lodge his scars, his wants, his sorrows, and himself too, as in the best repository.</P>
<P N="2">The Gospel command of <HI>not caring for the morrow,</HI> Mat. vi. 34. and being <HI>careful for nothing,</HI> Phil. iv. 6. nakedly pro∣posed, might seem the abandoning of us to all the calamities of life: But when we are directed to <HI>cast all our care</HI> upon a gra∣cious and all powerful parent, and are as∣sured that <HI>he cares for us,</HI> 1 Pet. v. 7. that <HI>though a woman may forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion of the son of her womb, yet will be not forget his children,</HI> Isai. xlix. 15. this will abun∣dantly supersede all cavil and objection.
<PB N="201" REF="031170_0200_0FEB154B6E6EDF10"/>
Whilst worldly men trust in an arm of flesh, lay up <HI>treasure on earth,</HI> a prey for <HI>rust and moth,</HI> Mat. vi. 19. and a <HI>torment</HI> to themselves, Jam. v. 3. the Christian has Omnipotence for his support, and a <HI>treasure in heaven, where no thief approach∣es, nor moth corrupts,</HI> Mat. vi. 20. Whilst bold inquirers call in question God's se∣cret will, oblige him to their sub or su∣pralapsarian schemes, their absolute or conditional decrees, their grace foreseen or predetermined; the pious man with aw∣ful acquiescence submits to that which is revealed, resolves for ever to obey, but never to dispute: as knowing that the be∣loved disciple leaned on his Master's bo∣som; but it is the thieves and traitors part to go about to rifle it.</P>
<P N="3">It is surely a modest demand in the behalf of God almighty, that we should allow him as much privilege in his world, as every peasant claims in his cottage; to be master there, and dispose of his house∣hold as he thinks best: To <HI>say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to his servant, Do this, and he doth it,</HI> Mat. viii. 9. And if we would afford him this liberty, there would be an immediate and put to all clamour and complaint.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="202" REF="031170_0201_0FEB154E3A617EE0"/>
4. We make it our daily prayer that the <HI>will</HI> of God <HI>may be done on earth as it is in heaven,</HI> with a ready, swift, and uninter∣rupted constancy. As it is giant-like re∣bellion to set up our will against his, so is it mad perverseness to set it up against our own; be displeased that our requests are granted, and repine that his, and therewith our will is done. It were indeed not only good manners, but good policy, to observe the direction of the heathen, and <HI>follow God,</HI> not prejudge his determination by ours; but in a modest suspension of our thoughts, <HI>bearken what the Lord God will say concerning us, for be will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints that they turn not again.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Or however upon surprise we may indulge to a passionate affection, and dote upon our illegitimate off-spring, our darl∣ing guilts or follies, as <HI>David</HI> did upon that child, who was the price of murder and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Yet when the brat is taken from us, when the <HI>child is dead,</HI> it will be∣come us to do as he did, rise from our sul∣len posture on the earth, and <HI>worship in the house of the Lord,</HI> 2 Sam. xii. 20. It will behove us, as he says in another place, to <HI>lay our hand upon our mouth, because it was his doing,</HI> and with holy <HI>Job</HI> chap. xl. 4, 5. when charged with his murmurings.
<PB N="203" REF="031170_0202_0FEB15510DF7A348"/>
<HI>Behold I am vile, what shall I answer? once have I spoken, but I will not answer: yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Socrates</HI> rightly said of contentment, opposing it to the riches of fortune and opinion, that it is the wealth of nature, for it gives every thing that we have learnt to want, and really need: But resignation is the riches of grace, bestowing all things that a christian not only needs, but can de∣sire, even almighty God himself. He in∣deed, as the school-men teach, is the ob∣jective happiness of the creature: He who is the fountain of being, must be also of blessedness; and though this be only com∣municable to us, when we have put off that <HI>flesh which cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</HI> and laid aside that <HI>corruption</HI> which cannot <HI>inherit corruption,</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 50. yet even in this life, we may make ap∣proaches to that blessed state, by acts of resignation and denial of ourselves. It was the generous saying of <HI>Socrates</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about to die unto his friend: O <HI>Crito,</HI> since it is the will of God, so let it be: <HI>Anytus</HI> and <HI>Melytus</HI> may kill me, but cannot hurt me. But such a resignation as it is infinitely a greater duty to a christian, so it is also a more firm security. In that case it is not the martyr, but Jesus of Nazareth who is thus persecuted, and he who attacks him

There could not be a greater in∣stance of the profligate sensuality of the Is∣raelites, than that they murmured for want of <HI>leeks and onions,</HI> Numb. xi. 5. when they are angels food, and had bread rained down from heaven. It is impossible for the soul that is sensible of God almighty's favour, to repine at any earthly pressure. <HI>The Lord is my shepherd,</HI> saith David, <HI>there∣fore can I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack nothing,</HI> Psal. xxiii. 1.

Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed; and though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea. Though the waters thereof rage and swell, and though the mountains shake at the tempest of the same. If God be in the midst of us, we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be removed, he will help us, and that right early.</HI> Let us therefore possess ourselves of this support, and as the prophet advises, Isai.

<P>FORGET not that thy station on earth is appointed by the wisdom of the eternal; who knoweth thy heart, who seeth the vanity of all thy wishes, and who often in mercy, denieth thy requests.</P>
<P>Yet for all reasonable desires, for all honest endeavours, his benevolence hath established, in the nature of things, a pro∣bability of success.</P>

<P>The poor man seeth not the vexations and anxieties of the rich, he feeleth not the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ffilties and perplexities of power, neither knoweth he the wearisomness of

<P>But envy not the appearance of happi∣ness in any man, for thou knowest not his secret griefs.</P>
<P>To be satisfied with a little, is the great∣est wisdom; and he that increaseth his riches, increaseth his cares: But a con∣tented mind is a hidden treasure, and trou∣ble findeth it not.</P>
<P>Yet if thou sufferest not the allurements of fortune to rob thee of justice, or tem∣perance, or charity, or modesty, even riches themselves shall not make thee un∣happy.</P>
<P>But hence shalt thou learn, that the cup of felicity, pure and unmixed, is by no means a draught for mortal man.</P>
