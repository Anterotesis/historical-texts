<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>My trusty servants <HI>Bute</HI> and <HI>Mansfield,</HI> have educated thee for my service, and taught thee the way wherein thou should'st go, obey them and I will make thee a king indeed; make yourself absolute, or die in the attempt: a king dependent on the people, is no monarch; he is a mere puppy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your words I have a heart to obey; 'tis the beat of my soul, and the world shall soon know that I am a king in reality, and my people shall feel that my wrath is like the roaring of a lion.</P>

<P>I doubt not you will equal my antient servants <HI>Nero, Caligula, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgia, Charles,</HI> and others; but you must use great art lest a spirit of liberty should rise among the peo∣ple and blast your great designs, as happened to my faith∣ful servant <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will begin with my colonies; the idea of enslaving them to the power of parliament, and making them tri∣butary to the old dominion, suits the pride and avarice of Britons: when this is done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he way will be open and easy to complete the work in Britain▪ with places, pensions, titles and bribes▪ I can soon make myself as absolute as any tyrant that ever stept.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on my beloved servant, and cut the work short; thou art the darling of my heart: I hope you will yet shed a sea of human blood sufficient for the British navy to ride in.</P>

<P>See how things ripen.—I'll soon kindle rebellion in America, and then with a few troops subdue the rebels, confiscate the country, and establish <HI>my will</HI> as law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pox take ye, what have you been about these four∣teen years?—The work ought to have been done; 'ere now you should have been as terrible to your people as the lion to the tame beast of the field; but you are yet a beg∣gar to parliaments.</P>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>See the fields of Lexington and Bunker Hill.—Now the wheels begin to move—the torrent of blood is rapid: I trust you will never again have cause to lash my delays. In time past my counsels have been divided; and that timid goose of a <HI>Gage</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s been dilatory:—but I have sent Howe, Burgoyne and Clinton to assist him, and push things:— Howe is a true blood-hound; Burgoyne is ambitious as Lucifer, and would kill his father for promotion; and Clinton is obedient to his master as a shepherd's dog.</P>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>You now begin to do something:—But you in your speeches and your generals in their proclamations, tell too many lies, and commit too many horrid acts of barbarity, for the success of your cause; in these you run too fast;— they strike mankind with horror, and unite them against you—there is not a character in Tophet stinks (above ground) worse than yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>You told me to make short work, and I said I had a heart for it:—accordingly by perjury and lies, fire and sword, by the gallows &amp; dungeons, freezing and starving, I have been subduing the rebels, and hope to finish the work in America soon; for I want to begin with my sub∣jects at home.</P>

<P>We are all in tears, but what can I do more; I sent fleets and armies, which all my ministers swore were more than sufficient to lay America prostrate at my feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Instead of showing the spirit of a lion, you have the head of a goat and the heart of a sheep; and if you don't pursue your plan until the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk is complete, by the ghost of <HI>Nero,</HI> I hope the English will play <HI>Charles</HI> with you. If you fail, what a deform'd mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grel puppy you will ap∣pear to all the world; neither generosity and benevolence to gratify your people, nor art and spirit enough to make yourself a tyrant.—Poor d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>! you'll be the scorn of the world, and the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ision of hell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I had not begun, but there is no retreat. I'll move every wheel to increase my force by sea and land; I will send commissioners with great promises (which I can easily break when the business is done) and large bribes, and partly by art and partly by force, I may yet succeed. I know my crown will sit uneasy and my life be wretched after this, unless I gain my point.</P>

<P>Do you see what the French are doing?</P>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my liege; do help me curse them; O for a flood of anathemes that would sweep them to the centre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Words are but wind, a million oaths won't sink a French ship, nor will ten thousand curses kill one rebel.— You stupid dog▪ if you would reign you must fight. It is now or never with you, not only the French but all the na∣tions in Europe secretly aid America, and wish her success. You ought to have done the work at once, and not have allowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime for the rebels to form alliances.</P>

<SPEAKER>G</SPEAKER>
<P>My liege, don't use me ill, you never had a servant more d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evoted to thy service, and very few have ever done so much to promote thy kingdom. In my early youth I debauch'd the fair qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ker, and had three bastards by her, besides innumerable other instances of wickedness, of which you are witness. I have deceived my people with a show of religion; (this proves that I am no fool in hypocrisy) and at the same time have practised every iniquity, have employed such men in public offices as were thy faithful servants—and my head to full of schemes &amp; my heart full of malice for every evil work.—And—</P>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a good heart, George, and I'll make some∣thing of you yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have the heart of a tyrant. I never felt one tender emotion for all the sufferings of mankind, and I hope to prove that my head is equal to my heart. Permit me, my liege, to say that I have some merit for past services, and for my future designs. I have, at a moderate computation, by my attempts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o enslave America, destroyed at least fifty thousand people—and have destroyed the happiness of fifty thousand more—And should I succeed, I'll surpass in bar∣barity any tyrant that ever lived. I mean to be a demi∣devil. I have in my imagination new tortures for man∣kind; I mean that my furnace of torture should be seventy seven times hotter than Nebuchadnezzar's; for a novelty, and to show my genius, I will have a saw-mill carried by a stream of virgin blood to saw off rebels heads!—think of this my liege, and allow me the credit of it▪—Did ever Nero, or Caligula, perform any thing equal to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your heart is good, George, and you may yet make a figure if you persevere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to perseverance, never fear my falling in that, I am of the blood hound breed, never leave the track, and my best friends have for this reason call'd me obstinate. I have said, and I swear to it, and stand to it, that I'll lose my crown before I'll give up America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>In case America should prove unconquerable, what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, even in that desperate extremity, I shall still have great designs left; I mean to perfect my tyranny in Britain if I fail in America; this I can easily do by bribing parliaments; and the immense increase of public burdens will facilitate my design; the spirits of the people are more and more depressed and broken, and the avarice of the great is likewise increased; the work is easy, and I had ra∣ther be a little tyrant than a great king. To be a despot over the rest of my dominions, would be a compensation even for the loss of America: tyranny has been the plan and pursuit of my life, it is sweet to my soul, and a tyrant I will be, or be nothing.</P>

<P>Stop, stop, stop, ye Minden scoundrel, I see it now, I see what is to follow, but I won't hear it from your cow∣ard lips—Lord Cornwallis is left to defend both land and ocean; and he'll do it! his noble blood, his titled name, his martial fame, will conspire to kindle the British peer into heroic fire: he'll fight and conquer until his laurels reach the skies: and that son of <HI>Neptune,</HI> Digby, has spread his canvass wings to join him—then Gallic ships and rebel troops will fly before the British thunder like feathers in a whirlwind!</P>

<P>All Europe bends a willing ear to this rebellion: Behold the rebel <HI>Plenipoes</HI> receiv'd with royal smiles in every court!

(with whom he deigns to speak,) "he represents the NEW WORLD, and came to give them commerce round the globe—and to establish

eternal peace."—And he lets astonished nations know he came from CONGRESS, (compar'd with whom the as∣sembled Greek and Roman gods, sink in human view) who claim kindred with the stars, and call the sun their el∣der brother;—and whose puissant arm makes the CAESARS tremble; hushes the warring realms to peace, and binds the omnipotence of Britain—he even aims a stroke at my domains; not confin'd to earth, he talks that providence divine hath pointed out to every land to form an UNION WITH HIS WORLD—and that HEAVEN hath set its seal to INDEPENDENCE—and said, AMEN!</P>
<P>Did sun, or moon, or stars, or earth, or sky, from crea∣tion's early dawn, ever behold an equal to this REBEL — But remember George, such is human kind▪ men will gaze at, wonder, and adore the man, who adores himself—and this rebel will shake Europe.</P>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>It won't do men; but I must take off <HI>Adams,</HI> for he appears in such a pompous stile, that all Europe is fascina∣ted with his fine stories about the NEW WORLD; he has a serpentine head and heart—he's all treason—and no∣thing of the dove in him, except the wings, to fly from one mischief to another—his soul contains the quintessence of all rebellion—O master, double your curses upon him—I have try'd to buy some of the rebel chiefs, but I can pur∣chase none▪ excepting a few scoundrels, who are only a curse to me. That perjured thief of an <HI>Arnold</HI> cost me upwards of five thousand sterling—(with a less sum I can purchase nineteen Lords and sixty Commoners) and I've only a piece of the scoundrel, for he lost one leg before I bought him —A dear bargain, you'll say, dear indeed; for I would sell him for ten yards of Scotch plaid.—I've poor bargains of all the tories, these slaves don't pay for the salt they eat; take them one with another and all together, they are not worth a curse; they are of no more use to me, than a wooden leg to a man that has no body.</P>

<SPEAKER>G</SPEAKER>
<P>If you must take 'em, pray take 'em soon, for I want to be quit of all such lumber—I've been curst with them long enough, They pretend great loyalty, but I find 'em hollow hearted fellows, who sawn round me, for the same reason a dog does his master, to get a crust. Beside, their fulsome adulation is enough to turn my guts inside out— They perfectly stink in my nostrils, and scent the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your best way, George, will be to sell the tories at vendue; they are form'd for slaves, and altho' the meanest, yet the Dutch will buy them for the Guinea trade.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll sell them, knock them off for something or noth∣ing, any how, so that I am rid of them. But I must not waste time about these rascalls, I must attend to the war, for I will prosecute it with vigour, until I obtain an hono∣rable peace.

They mean not only to get the new world, but to knock you out of the old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I've subdued America, I'll "knock" the dogs till they'll lick the dust under my royal feet.—Although the French king is not to be compared with any king like us for royal greatness; yet I cannot but wonder that he could disgrace royalty by a connection with the rebels. I'd be curst through <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> by all the <HI>whores in Drury-Lane,</HI> before I'd stoop so low.</P>

George, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> you address me, do it in the language of truth; I allow you to lie to every one else; but don't tell foolish lies that no body will believe, as you and your ministers often do. George, I tell you, between me and you, this rebellion is alarming to my dominions, and threatens yours with ruin. The vast continent of America, pregnant with the richest stores of nature, inhabited with a brave and enterprising people; enthusiastic in religion and li∣berty; and have laid foundations to perpetuate both; penetrating and daring in all their views; inflamed by your attempts to enslave them, have written your crimes in marble, with a "cursed be he that forgets or forgives the tyrant,"— "and blessed be their memory, and only theirs who preserve <HI>Independence.</HI>" With whom magna∣nimity and virtue recommend to office (and rulers stamp the manners of the people) in whose creed I and you, are equally opposed and execrated. This people, I say, have
<PB N="15" REF="017520_0014_0FA12C70EEB42570"/>
excited and will command the admiration and imitation of mankind. In their public writings▪ speeches and trans∣actions, they stamp glory on RELIGION and LIBERTY, and aim to make them both eternal:—and if they suc∣ceed, I and you are eternally excluded from their favor; and that they will succeed we have every reason to fear; for all the old world is now gazing with admiration on the new. Kings hope to derive glory from an early friendship with this rising nation; and their subjects ex∣pect to gain infinite wealth by this union. Every Dutch∣man has his golden dreams about the NEW WORLD; they would not have listened with half the attention to the prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> they did to <HI>Adams;</HI> and this frenzy spreads like a pestilence through the nations and fascinates the world. If America is independent, universal ruin follows; therefore, George, hold out to the last, and be as obstinate as hell.</P>

<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me alone for obstinacy, I've an heart of ada∣mant, there's no turn to me; my will never was broke, nor ever can be, there's no break nor bend to it if once I say no,—neither soothing nor praying, nor freezing nor burning, will ever move me; there's no move to me, I tell you, I'll be curst if there is. They tell of <HI>Nero</HI>'s firmness, in fiddling while the city of Rome was burning; damn his buttons, why I could fiddle and wench too, if half the world was in flames. As to the terrors of the new world they tell so much about, I fear not any world, new or old,—let the worlds go which way they will, I'll go to mine; and may all the scoundrels in the universe buffet me through creation, if ever I submit to indepen∣dence; may annihilation catch me, and I never more dar∣ken any point of space if I do.</P>

<P>It kindles my ire, and goes cross my soul like an iron teeth harrow; but I'll soon bring down their <HI>Excellency's,</HI> and turn them to <HI>axletrees</HI> for my waggons, with a cursa∣tion after them, to transport chains for rebels.

<P>Ever animated with the most ardent affection to the best of kings, I feel the sighs of loyalty whenever his majesty meets with any misfortune. I wish not to cri∣minate any one: but, as I said before, it is notorious where the fault lies: his majesty's commanders, by sea and land, have trifled away the opportunities that offered for defeating the French, and subduing the rebels. I should be happy to hear his majesty express his royal sen∣timents on this great occasion.</P>

<P>"By the providence of the Almighty▪ the time is come which compels the reluctant wish for peace.—Since your sword can no longer devour, and is ready to be plung'd in the guilty bosom that kindled the war, you think of peace. —Peace is the desire of humanity, the constant object of

the wise and good; it hath ever been the ardent wish of America, and all her views have centered in this; but your hostile heart hath hitherto shut the door against it. I will express the views of America, in a few words. She means not only to be independent, sovereign and free, but to communicate as far as may be in her power, the super∣lative blessings herself enjoys to all mankind As she means that all the treaties she forms should be lasting as time, and thereby to establish perpetual peace, in her treaty with Bri∣tain she will not measure her terms by the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies she hath received, but looking forward to distant ages, and me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sur∣ing things on the great scale of the world, with benevo∣lent views to humanity, she will give to Britain such terms of peace and commerce, as shall be for the general good of mankind: and leave it to providence, to punish the enor∣mities of the present rulers of Britain and their abettors, who have shed the innocent blood of Americans.—In a word, America will be in every view as completely an in∣dependent, sovereign nation, as any power that now ex∣ists in the world; and she will give to every nation with whom she forms a treaty, the same privileges she receives, and nothing more.</P>
<P>By the favor and protection of GOD, who hath given her the best quarter of the world, and exalted her to the rank of empire, she means by sacred honor, and justice, and humanity, to hold the balance of the nations, and to be a friend to the oppressed, and an enemy to none but the enemies of peace.—From these general principles, the concessions you must make, in order to obtain peace, are obvious, and I need not name them. But before I con∣clude, let me remind you <HI>"there is no peace to the wick∣ed"</HI>—and your crimes are numberless, and their enormity is equal to their number. You were exalted to reign over a grateful people, who loved you with parental tender∣ness and brotherly affection; they expected a return of love, and in the careless confidence which love inspires, exposed their liberties to the grasp of a tyrant.—You con∣ceived their security aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rded the wish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for moment to enslave them, and equally regardless of your duty to GOD

and to man, you formed the horrid design, and have pur∣sued it by means too inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnal to be named; you have violated all the sacred laws of Heaven and earth, and sported with human misery. When America asked only for liberty, peace and sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety—only for the enjoyment of what GOD had given, you sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e and sword; and while they begged for mercy, you added torture and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the most horrid forms. — Thousands who once sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ardent prayers for you, changed them into petitions that GOD would stay your murdering hands.—For many long years every breeze hath wafted the groans of dying pri∣soners to Heaven against you, while every hour hath wit∣nessed the big tears and swelling bosoms of their surviving friends! What myriad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have you sent down to the cham∣bers of death; and in the bosom of surviving thousands, you have planted the sharp them of affliction! The aged parents cry with anguish. "O my son! my son! my only son! is murdered by the tyrant George." The bereaved widow and weeping children, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h bleeding hearts, cry out, "O my husband! my father! we shall never, never see him again! he is murdered by the tyrant." The virgin, whose dearer s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cond self, was gloriously con∣tending in the field to save his country, became a captive, and suffered complicated death by cold and hunger; she cannot speak for grief—in silent sorrow sinks down, and in her languid eye, she looks a prayer to heaven! Her an∣guish is too great to find a voice, but heaven can hear her wishes, and will avenge her wrongs! Well may you turn pale at your picture, and fain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the prospect of wrath divine, and triple vengeance ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d with almighty thun∣der! You have sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghted the commands of your GOD and SAVIOUR, and despised the precepts of the Prince of Peace; therefore you may justly fear that He will "laugh at your calamity, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k when your fear co∣meth;" that as you refused mercy it shall be refused to you, and when "destruction and desolation cometh upon you like a whirlwind," no arm shall relieve you▪ no eye shall pity you; but rapt in final ruin, si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k down, down, down to the regions of horror and death eternal!</P>
