<HEAD><HI>A Letter from the Rev. Mr.</HI> Whitefield, <HI>to a Friend in</HI> London, <HI>shewing the Funda∣mental Error of a Book, entituled,</HI> The Whole Duty of Man.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE it has pleased God to give me a true Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace, I have frequently thought, that next to the fal∣ling away of the Clergy from the Principles of the Reformation, the Books which are in our Church founded on the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, have been the chief Cause why so many of our own Communion in particular, have built their Hopes of Salvation on a false Bottom. The Authors not only led the People Captive in their own Life Time, but also after their Death, like <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> for a long Season have be∣witched the People with their Sorceries; I mean their seemingly devout, but at the Bottom Anti-Christian, Compositions.</P>
<P>The only Way therefore, to open People's Eyes, I think is this: To shew them that the Writings which for some Years past, have been so much admired, are directly contrary to the Gospel of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for this Reason, I thought it my Duty, to bear a publick Testimony a∣gainst the Writings of Archbishop <HI>Tillotson▪</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="004642_0003_100DB606B29806C0"/>
And upon the same Account, think it my Du∣ty▪ to point out the Fundamental Error of an Author as much admired and read by the more common, as the Archbishop by the more lear∣ned and polite, sort of People.</P>
<P>I know you are impatient to hear, who this can be: If you will promise me not to be an∣gry, I'll tell you; it is that much admir'd Book called the WHOLE DUTY OF MAN. Methinks, I see you surprized at the very men∣tioning of it. But remember, I desir'd you not to be angry; and if you will throw aside Prejudice, and are sincerely desirons to know and do the divine Will, I am persuaded we shall be both of one Mind concerning this Book, are you lay this Letter down out of your Hand.</P>
<P>But before I shew you its Error, to convince you of my Impartiality, I confess, that the Devotions of that Book, were once of Service to me: And I believe have been useful to ma∣ny others. The Book in general, is calculated to <HI>civilize,</HI> but I am persuaded it never was a Means of <HI>converting</HI> one single Soul. I have just been looking over the Index and general Titles at the End of it, and cannot find the Word <HI>Regeneration</HI> so much as once mention∣ed; and indeed the whole Treatise is built on such a false Foundation, as not only proves the Author to be no real Christian at Heart▪ But
<PB N="5" REF="004642_0004_100DB608EF07CF68"/>
also, that he had not so much as a Head-Know∣ledge of the true Gospel of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> To prove this, I need only refer you to part of the Preface, <HI>Of the Necessity of caring for the Soul,</HI> (17th Paragraph) wherein the Au∣thor talking of the second Covenant, speaks thus: <HI>This second Covenant,</HI> says he, <HI>was made with</HI> Adam <HI>and us in him, presently after his Fall, and is briefly contain'd in those Words, Gen. 3d, 15th, where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman shall break the Serpent's Head; and this was made up as the First was, of some Mercies to be afforded by God, and some Duties to be performed by us.</HI> Who, that is any Way enlighten'd, cannot see the false Divinity and Fundamental Errors of this Pas∣sage? For how can it be proved, that the se∣cond Covenant was made with <HI>Adam</HI>; or that God ever entered into any Covenant at all, with Man after he had broken the First? It is true, he did enter into a Covenant, (and that from all Eternity,) with the second <HI>Adam▪</HI> the God-Man <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> in our Stead. But it cannot be proved that he made any second Co∣venant at all with <HI>Adam</HI> himself, or any of his Po∣sterity. But says our Author;
<Q>He did make a second Covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> and us in him, presently after his Fall, and it is briefly contained in these Words, <HI>Gen. 3d.</HI> &amp; 15th,
<PB N="6" REF="004642_0005_100DB60AA99DDAB8"/>
where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman shall break the Serpent's Head.</Q>
But I would ask, where any Covenant is contained in these Words? And, how it is made up as the first was, of some Mercies to be afforded by God, and some Duties to be performed by us? Here is a <HI>free Gift</HI> and Promise of Salva∣tion made to <HI>Adam,</HI> but no Covenant, not a Word of any Condition mentioned. No, it was the free Gift of God in <HI>Christ. Adam</HI> was now in a State of Condemnation, he was so far from being desirous of entring into Co∣venant with, that he fled from, God, and was not so much as truly convicted of his Sin; as will evidently appear from the Context. For, both he and his Wife laid the Fault not upon <HI>themselves,</HI> but one <HI>another</HI> and the <HI>Serpent. The Woman which thou gavest me,</HI> (therein tacitly reflecting upon God, for giving him that Woman,) <HI>she gave me,</HI> says Adam, <HI>and I did eat.</HI> Here appears no true Sense of Sin at all: and to shew they had no Notion of a Sa∣viour, we are told they sewed Fig Leaves to∣gether, instead of applying to God, to cover their Nakedness; and afterwards fled from God, when they heard the Voice of the Lord God walking among the Trees in the Garden. Here then opens the Mystery of Godliness, God ma∣nifest in the Flesh. Notwithstanding our first
<PB N="7" REF="004642_0006_100DB60E6A2F4D18"/>
Parents had broken the Covenant, and had their Hearts hardened; yet, out of the Riches of his <HI>free Grace,</HI> God had provided a Reme∣dy from all Eternity, and now reveals it in Time. <HI>The Seed of this Woman,</HI> i. e. <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> (who in all Probability was spiritually conceived that Instant in the Heart of <HI>Eve</HI>) <HI>shall bruise the Serpent's Head, i. e.</HI> by his O∣bedience and Death, shall satisfy divine Justice, fulfill the moral Law in Man's Stead, and thereby deliver him from the Power of the De∣vil. Here are no <HI>Terms</HI> mentioned, on Man's Part at all. And supposing there had been a Co∣venant made with Man, <HI>'And it had been made up as the first was, of some Mercies to be afforded by God, and some Duties to be performed by us:</HI> Alas, we are of all Crea∣tures the most miserable; for then we are not under <HI>Grace,</HI> but under the <HI>Law.</HI> And if <HI>A∣dam</HI> could not keep the <HI>first</HI> Covenant, tho' in perfect Innocence; how can we, who hate God by Nature, and whose Thoughts are only evil continually, keep a <HI>second</HI> like unto it? Is not this putting Man into a most unhappy Condi∣tion, and making his poor imperfect Obedience the <HI>Cause</HI> why <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is merciful unto him? and if so, how is boasting excluded in the great Work of our Redemption, as the Scriptures every where affirm? And how can Eternal
<PB N="8" REF="004642_0007_100ECA10DBC2C408"/>
Life be the free <HI>Gift</HI> of God, thro' <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord? But this is agreeable enough to the Divinity of this Author, who in the Twen∣ty-first Paragraph of his Preface says; <HI>The Third Thing that</HI> Christ <HI>was to do for us, was, to enable us, or give us Strength, to do what God requires of us. This he doth, first by taking off from the Hardness of the Law given to</HI> A∣dam <HI>,which was, never to commit the least Sin upon Pain of Damnation, and requiring of us only an holy and hearty Endeavour to do what we are able, and where we fail ac∣cepting of sincere Repentance.</HI> Now, I would fain know, where God has taken off from the Hardness of the Law given unto <HI>Adam</HI>? And required of us only an holy and hearty Endea∣vour to do what we are able? And, when we fail, accepting of sincere Repentance? This is all as false, as God is true; the whole Law is as much, in Force against <HI>us,</HI> as it was against <HI>A∣dam,</HI> before we are found in <HI>Christ.</HI> God has been so far from taking off from the Hardness of the Law given to <HI>Adam,</HI> that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> declares, that he came not to <HI>destroy,</HI> but to <HI>fulfil</HI> it. And, until convinc'd of the Obliga∣tion we lie under to obey the whole moral Law, in Thought, Word, and Deed, how can we see the Necessity of the Righteousness of <HI>Jesus Christ?</HI> God's Law was honourable, <HI>Jesus
<PB N="9" REF="004642_0008_100ECA069AD06528"/>
Christ</HI> fulfilled it in our Stead, and upon Account of that Righteousness <HI>imputed</HI> to us, and not on our hearty Endeavours or Repen∣tance, are we accepted by him. What is there in our hearty Endeavour or Repentance, to re∣commend us to the Favour of God, or render them worthy or being <HI>joined</HI> with the Righ∣teousness of <HI>Christ,</HI> as tho' <HI>that</HI> was not suffi∣cient in <HI>itself</HI>? Our best <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are but <HI>Splen∣dida peccata, glittering Sins. I cannot pray,</HI> says the pious Bishop <HI>Beveridge, but I Sin; I cannot hear or preach a Sermon, but I Sin; I cannot give an Alms, or receive the Sacrament, but I Sin; Nay, I cannot confess my Sins, but my very Confessions are still Aggravations to them: my Repentings need to be repented of; my Tears want washing, and the very washing of my Tears, need still to be washed over again with the Blood of my Redeemer,</HI> Jesus Christ, The Lord is our <HI>whole</HI> Righteousness, we are to go to him as poor Sinners. Beg Salvation of him as his <HI>free Gift,</HI> and entreat him to give us a living Faith, whereby that Righteous∣ness may be applied to our Hearts; and then that Faith, if true, will work by Love. This, the Author of the WHOLE DUTY OF MAN, was wholly ignorant of, otherwise he would not have laid such a Foundation: and if the Foundation be so bad, judge you how wretchedly
<PB N="10" REF="004642_0009_100ECA0899080520"/>
weak, the Surperstructure must be. It would take more Time than I can at present spare, to point out all the Mistakes of the whole Book: I will only refer you to what this Author says about Recreations, Sunday, 19th, Sec. 7th wherein he seems not only to allow of Gaming, by saying, <HI>if we play at any Game,</HI> but di∣rects us when we do it, to let <HI>the End of our doing it be meerly to recreate ourselves.</HI> I thought the Glory of God, and not <HI>self-pleasing,</HI> had been the Principle from which all Christians ought to act. I suppose from this Passage, a Man whom I reproved lately on the Road, for Gaming in the <HI>Christmas Holy-Days,</HI> grounded <HI>his</HI> Autho∣rity for so doing: He told me, <HI>the Whole Duty of Man</HI> said, he might do so And indeed I be∣lieve he is not the first by thousands, who have been miserably deceived, by this much applau∣ded Book: And therefore I thought myself o∣bliged to write this Letter. You may make what Use you will of it. I care not if the Con∣tents are published upon the House Top. Nay, I think it your Duty, if convinced yourself, to endeavour to convince others; for there's no Hopes of bringing People to a right Knowledge of the Gospel, till their Favourite, tho' erroneous, Au∣thors are discountenanc'd and laid aside. Before I see <HI>England,</HI> I hope I shall hear that my dear Friends in the Ministry, both in preaching and
<PB N="11" REF="004642_0010_100ECA0A1BEBDF78"/>
printing have seconded my Testimony. Future Ages as well as the present, will be much behol∣den to them for it. Their Declarations will stand as Records that God did not leave himself with∣out Witness, even in the Worst of times. Other Gospel Ministers will be much encourag'd there∣by; and thousands, nay, ten thousands prefer∣ved from Infection, which other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> perhaps they may not be able avoid. However, whether they second me or not, by the Help of my God, both abroad and at Home, (if it be the Divine Will I should see <HI>England</HI> again) I will persevere in bearing a more explicite and parti∣cular Testimony against the false Writings of our admired <HI>Rabbies.</HI> Do you and my other Friends watch over me; reprove me sharply whenever you perceive my Spirit embitter'd. Pray that I may be as meek as a Lamb, and as bold as a Lion; and then whatever befalls me for speaking as I ought to speak, through divine Grace shall be chearfully submitted to by</P>
