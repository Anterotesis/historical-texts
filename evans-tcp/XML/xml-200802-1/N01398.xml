<HEAD><HI>1</HI>st Part, It was proposed,</HEAD>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> That the Ministers of the Country form themselves into Associations, that may meet at proper times to Consider such things as may properly lie before them, Relating to their own faithfulness towards each other and the common Interest of the Churches; and that each of those Associations have a Moderator for a certain time, who shall con∣tinue till another be chosen, who may call them together upon Emergencies.</P>
<P>In these Associations,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> That Questions and Cases of impor∣tance, either provided by themselves or by others presented unto them, should be upon due deliberation Answered.</P>

Pastors, from time to time, e're they Proceed to any action in their Particular Churches, which be likely to produce any imbroilments. That the associated Pastors do Carefully and Lovingly treat each other with that watch∣fullness which may be of Universal advantage, &amp; that if any Minister be accused to the Associa∣tion whereto he belongs, of Scandal or Heresie, the Matter shall be there examined, and if the Associated Ministers find just accusation for it, they shall direct to the calling of the Council, by whom such an Offendor is to be proceeded against.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> That the Candidates of the Mini∣stry under-go a due Tryal by some one or other of the Associations concerning their Qualifications for the Evangelical Ministry, and that no particular Pastor or Congrega∣tion Imploy any one in occasional Preaching who has not been Recommended by a Testi∣monial under the hands of some Association.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly.</HI> That they should together be con∣sulted by Bereaved Churches, to Recommend to them such Persons as may be fit to be imployed amongst them for present Supply, from whom they may in due time proceed to chuse a Pastor.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>thly.</HI> That hereunto may be referred the Direction of Proceeding in any of their par∣ticular

<P N="7">7<HI>thly.</HI> That the Several Associations in the Country maintain a due Correspondence with one another, that so the state of Religion may be the better known and secured in all the Churches, and particularly it is thought necessary to the well being of these Chur∣ches, that all the Associations of the Country meet together by their Respective Delegates once in a year.</P>
<P N="8">8<HI>thly.</HI> And <HI>finally,</HI> That Ministers Dispo∣sed to Associate indeavour in the most Effi∣cacious manner they can, to Prevail with such Ministers as unreasonably neglect such Meetings with their Brethren, in their pro∣per Associations, that they would not expose themselves to the Inconveniencies that such Neglects cannot but be attended withal.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Second Part, It is proposed.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> That these Associated Pastors, with a proper Number of Delegates from their several Churches, be formed into a standing or stated Council, which shall Consult, Advise and Determine all Affairs that shall be proper matter for the Consideration of an Ecclesiastical Council within their respe∣ctive

Limits, except always, the Cases are such as the Associated Pastors judge more convenient to fall under the Cognisance of some other Council.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> That to this end these Associated Pastors, with their Respective Churches, shall Consociate and Combine according to what has been by the Synods of these Churches recommended, that they act as Consociated Churches in all holy Watchfulness and Help∣fulness towards each other, and that Each Church choose and depute one or more to Attend their Pastor, as Members of the Coun∣cil in their Stated Sessions, or Occasionally, as Emergencies shall call for.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> That these Messengers from the several Consociated Churches shall be chosen once a year at the least.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> It is propounded, as that which from our beginning has been Recommended, that the Churches, thus Consociated for these pur∣poses, have a stated time to meet in their Council, and once in a year seems little enough, that they may Inquire into the Condition of the Churches, and Advise such things as may be for the Advantage of our holy Religion. But the more particular time is best left to the Determination of each respective Association.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001660_0006_0FB4D7B045D51E48"/>That the Associations shall Direct when there is Occasion for this Council to convene, on any Emergency, and shall direct whether the whole, or only a certain Number of these consociated Pastors and Churches shall Con∣veen on such Occasions.</P>
<P>It appears agreable to the present Con∣dition of our Churches, and from our begin∣nings acknowledged, That no Act of the Councils are to be reckoned as Concluded and decisive, for which there has not been the Concurrence of the Major part of the Pastors therein concerned.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>thly.</HI> The determinations of the Councils thus Provided, for the necessities of the Churches, are to be looked upon as final and decisive, except agrieved Churches and Pastors, have weighty Reasons to the con∣trary, in which cases there should be Provi∣sion for a further hearing; and it seems pro∣per that the Council convened on this occa∣sion, should consist of such Pastors as may be more for number then the former, and they should be such, as shall be directed to, and convened for this purpose by the Ministers of an Association, near to that whereto these of the former Council belonged, unto which the agrieved should accordingly apply them∣selves, and in this way expect a final Issue?</P>

<HEAD>THE Epistle Dedicatory To the Fraternity of the Churches In the New-England Colonies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Truly honourable, &amp; beloved in Christ;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not from any Disrespect or for want of Honour to the Reverend Eldership and Pastors of your several Communities, that I apply my self more immediatly and thus abruptly to your selves in this Dedication. But for that it seems most agreeable with my present Province. The privi∣ledges of the Fraternity being so peculiarly the Theam and subject of my pains, <HI>I</HI> esteem it very proper to Introduce my following Essays, with a few words of Advice more directly to your selves, if you may be thence moved and incouraged to assist for the support of Christs and your own Interests. I desire to be without offence to any, and Pray that all such Worthy Persons, wise and faithful Pastors in these Churches (who are as much obliged by their office to stand by and de∣fend the Established Interest and Rights of them
<PB N="11" REF="001660_0010_0FB4D7B7C4EDB418"/>
as I am, and far more capable) will interpret my whole Action in the most favourable Sense. And tho' I have not with the Noble <HI>Cortius</HI> leapt into a Chasm made in the forum; yet I have ventured to step into the Gap, to keep the Breach, till <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hands come up, for the Service of my Country, and in Defence of their sacred Liberties; so that <HI>I</HI> hope many of you will come in with a new supply and Recruit of Courage and Argument when and where mine fails; and for the present <HI>I</HI> presume none of you will be offended, tho' I do thus Immediately address the Churches over which you preside, with the following Principles of their Interest and Duty wraped up each in other. Then</P>
<P>Honourable Brethren!</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> In general my Advice is to you, That in good order &amp; with all Gracefulness which becomes Wise Men, you will with Zeal, Courage and faith∣fullness, Stand in the Defence of and Maintain your <HI>Church Libertys</HI>; God certainly obliges you to do it, with all the discretion and bravery of Spirit, which becomes free-men, in withstanding Vassalage or a Servile State, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5 1.13. <HI>Stand fast there∣fore in the</HI> Liberties, <HI>wherewith Christ was made us free, and be not Intangled again with the Yok of Bondage:</HI> The Plea is as forcible against a <HI>Christian</HI> as a <HI>Jew∣ish Thraldom.</HI> For <HI>Brethren,</HI> ye have been called unto <HI>Liberty.</HI> I must acknowledge I have no par∣ticular Prejudice against any of the Governments of Christian Protestant Churches in the World, so as to defraud or dispossess any of them of Heaven; or Monopolize so great a Royalty to our own;
<PB N="12" REF="001660_0011_0FB4D7B9451CF5C0"/>
But yet I am of this opinion, considering the just Title of the Crown, the Churches, the People, the Capacity of Soil and Climate together, That the Constitution and Way of <HI>New-England</HI> Chur∣ches cannot be mended by Exchange.</P>
<P>Briefly to Instance in the Civil part, or Interest of the Crown, <HI>I</HI> think it is very easie to evince, by the Precepts both of Religion and Policy, That the Parliament (that wise and August Coun∣cil of the Nation) could not have invented an Establishment in Church Order, more for the service of the Imperial Crown of the British Empire than our present Constitution, espe∣cially in such a Country and Climate as this is.</P>
<P>I shall not now any ways enter upon the Question, but only give just a short hint as to the Revenue. Our Present Constitution does indeed, some-what more then Sip; It takes an honest Healthful Draught at Natures Fountains, but leaves the flowing streams for Empire to sit at till filled with saciety.</P>
<P>The Ecclesiasticks in some Kingdoms in <HI>Europe</HI> are ready not only to chide with <HI>Crowned heads,</HI> but to take them by the throat, and wring out of hands, if not almost a Moity, yet a vast share of the golden Fleeces that should supply the Publick Treasuries, and cloath the Nakedness of the Kingdoms, and the People have no more wit but to Justifie and defend them in their Claims and Oppressions, and that till they themselves (in great Numbers) are as thin and raged as Penury it self; for by their Rules of adjustment, when the Church hath gotten an Unconscionable share, Then the
<PB N="13" REF="001660_0012_0FB4D7BACC370788"/>
Crown or Subject must be almost starved; for there is not left a sufficient and plentiful supply for both.</P>
<P>But now our <HI>New-England</HI> Constitution is very fair-mannered; for when it sits down to the Staled Ox (made ready) it carves Temperately and (wit-hout much Defacing) Leaves the whole to Empire to make its Armies and Navies, with the rest of its needful and unwearied Ser∣vants wellcome. That in Loyalty to your Prince, and for the support of the Royal Revenue, you may Justly preserve your Freedoms.</P>
<P>Let us also Consider the best Good of a whole People.</P>
<P>It is most certain, true Grace is the one thing needful, and the main concern for the Improve∣ment of the Powers both of Prince, Noble and Peasant, and tho' Grace be of that nature that it will grow (after a fashion and in some sort of soil) almost under any Government, Yet it is most agreeable with Laws of Piety and Wisdom (for the good of all in general (to chuse and secure that Constitution and form of Government that is most a greeable, and which most naturally breeds it, and in greatest Plenty.</P>
<P>By the suffrage of our Nation, that Government which sensibly Clogs Tyranny, and Preserves the Subject free from slavery, under the ambition of men of great Fortune and Trust, is the only Goverment in the <HI>state,</HI> to advance mens tempo∣ral Happiness; and we in the Country Honour the Resolve in Civil Affairs, and also affirm (upon great Experience) that such a Constitution
<PB N="14" REF="001660_0013_0FB4D7BC4918B858"/>
in Church Government is (also) the only way to advance Grace and mans Eternal Happiness; and we are the more Ratifyed in our Opinion, for that the experiment has on the other hand been tryed, with a Witness, in almost all Kingdoms of the Christian World, and the <HI>first,</HI> by Disseising the Fraternity of all Interest in Church Goverment, only they have had the liberty to be Governed with a Hook in their Nose (like wild Cattle in a string) by the mercy and pleasure of their Drivers; but as for any share in the Exercise of Goverment, they have had no more, than the Horses in the Royal Stables, for that their Spiritual Owners having Seised all the Keys of Church Power, they profess no <HI>Dividend</HI> shall be made, and also they themselves being Uncontroulable by any, and unaccountable to any, unless it be to Christ him∣self, as they pretend; Tho' I believe, thousands of them never Expect to meet with him, nor think that he ever will audit any Accompts of theirs.</P>
<P>But however, for the comfort and glory of the Present Life, the whole Government of the Spirit∣ual Kingdom, in all its Branches, and with its Immense Profits, has Established theirs. But this sort of Discipline, hath sunk great part of the Christian World, as many times over, as Ages have past, since it hath been Intailed <HI>Ʋniversal Rector,</HI> and where it hath kept absolute possession of the Throne.</P>
<P>And must the Waves and present Currants fit and waste these Churches towards those Rocks and ship-wracks, whilst we have such good hands and Pilots on board? God forbid!</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001660_0014_0FB4D7BDC5356B78"/>Therefore let these Churches and the noble Fraternity of them, Stand their Ground, Keep fast hold of what you got, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.11. <HI>hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy Crown.</HI></P>
<P>Hold your hold Brethren! <HI>Et validis Incumbite Remis,</HI> Pull up well upon your Oars, you have a Rich Cargo and I hope we shall escape Ship∣wrack; for according to the latest observation if we are not within fight, yet we are not far from Harbour; and tho' the noise of great Breakers, which we hear, Imports hazard, yet I hope day∣light, and <HI>good Piloting will secure all.</HI></P>
<P>More Particularly I ask your Patience with Li∣berty (still for your service) to make the few following Distinct Petitions.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="petition">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Petition.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honourable Brethren!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WOuld you know what you are, and who you are, in the more ample and Heroick Sence of your state?</P>
<P>It is certainly very agreeable with Grace, for the upright, sometimes to shift Ideas, and change such as are mournful; for those which bear a bright aspect in their condition, otherways they may rob God of the <HI>Glory</HI> of the best part of his <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Bounty,</HI> and dis-inable their own strength, for some of the most important Service they are called to in the World; therefore <HI>Nehemiah</HI> plucks up his Courage and says, <HI>Shuld such a Man as I flee</HI>? as tho' he should say, he knew himself owner of
<PB N="16" REF="001660_0015_0FB4D7BF44FF4430"/>
too many great Endowments and Intrustments, to be so little as to run for it, or be dreaded with such an Alarm. <HI>Neh.</HI> 6.11.12.</P>
<P>So <HI>Brethren,</HI> Imagine your selves to be some∣thing more than Ordinary; for Really you be so; and that as you are a Gospel Combination, and Collectively Considered.</P>
<P>What! the best men of our Country, who form our Courts and Command our Armies, that ma∣kes the Figure and Casts the true lustre (by their great Wisdom and Real Accomplishments) in all great shews and Appearances, Must all these be made <HI>null</HI> or Buried in a Miosis (as is frequently Enacted by Ambition) for the sake of some infe∣riour Members in a Fraternity? which is as much as to say, in State Affairs, because Coblers stalls or Orange Sellers Baskets afford no <HI>states men, Ergo,</HI> none to be found; or because that in many great Counties there may chance to be an hundred Knaves, and twice the number of Fools, <HI>Ergo</HI> there be no <HI>Legales Homines,</HI> Lawful men, fit for Juries; no men fit for Burgesses or Knights of the shire, to be found to make Parliament Men? and so the Kingdom must needs loose all its Antient Rights by Default And whether or no such Observations as these, that are so very Conclusive, as you see, may stand for better Law and Logick in the Churches then in the Empire?</P>
<P>But if of equal force in each Constitution, then Whether this is not the way to inter and bury the Glory of the Empire and Churches in their own Rubbish, whilst we Incapassitate the Heroes of both by an Argument <HI>a minori ad Majus, viz.</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="001660_0016_0FB4D7C0C9664FA0"/>
by inferring the Insufficiency of the great and wise, because of the mean and base mingled in the same Communities.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="petition">
<HEAD>II. Petition.</HEAD>
<P>THat you will put such an Estimation and value on your Church Liberties as the English do on their Civil. And this is but a very reasonable Request, if you consider the Differing Treasu∣ries under custody, <HI>viz.</HI> Immortal Souls on the one hand, and outward Fortunes on the Other.</P>
<P>Many of you Know the storys (possibly better than I can recite them) which tell us what Ship Loads of Blood and Treasure those Civil Things have cost the English World; and how near they still lie to English mens hearts. And many of you being immediate Successors, cannot but be very sencible what these <HI>New-England Liberties have Cost your Progenitors,</HI> some of them having buried their Estates, and all of them their Bones in these Foundations, and left you now in Pos∣session, that if you should put Contempt upon their Adventures, their Courage, Wisdom, Zeal and Self-denial, by under-Prizing these Inesti∣mable Infranchizements, and fight them as tho' they were now to be Endorst by your own hands with <HI>Hezekiah's Nehustan,</HI> God may then put you to learn the Worth of them at that <HI>School</HI> where <HI>they Learnt</HI> it; and I am sure you will pay dear for your Tutoring if it comes to that.</P>

<HEAD>III. Petition. Honour and Oblige your Pastors and Publick Ministry.</HEAD>
<P>IT is certain they are very great Articles in the Reasons of your well being, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.13.14. They make all things more Savory, and to go down with a better Relish; Yea, they alter Tra∣gedies and Comedies into a more grateful Enter∣tainment. What is all the Glory in the World with∣out the Gospel Purity Dispenc't, and its most Refined Influence? These are the Light of the World, and carry the Lanthorn aloft in the dark night of your Travels, thro' the tempe∣stuous Ocean of a Miserable Life, to direct all to a safe Landing at last.</P>
<P>Indeed, I must acknowledge, your Ministers, when sound and faithful, are to be accounted and esteemed amongst the best of your Friends, tho' when Currupt and Prejudiced, the worst of your Enemies.</P>
<P>I think the Devil himself, and the World of his accomplices, can't do you the damage, They may upon a Revolt. That I beg you will be Curious and careful of your Interest Imbark't and Deposi∣ted there.</P>
<P>And without making any scruple (in the Main) they are your hearty and faithful Servants. Indeavour to increase their Love, and let them see and feel you have a double honour for them for their works sake. And if after all your repea∣ted
<PB N="19" REF="001660_0018_0FB4D7C3C5A01FE0"/>
Grace and Goodness, they will desert and betray you, they shall then Incur a double Guilt, both by Transgressing the Laws of Gratitude to you, and of Loyalty to their great Lord.</P>
<P>And I assure you, <HI>Sirs,</HI> I should upon such Terms be very loath to share in their Tryumphs, tho' their gains should be seemingly great, and their signals and shouts equal with the <HI>Caesars</HI> of the World in their going off.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="petition">
<HEAD>IV. Petition. Furnish your Churches with Ruling Elders!</HEAD>
<P>THe nature of the Office is not only agreeable with your Frame, and exacted by your Principles, but indeed carries safety and Protection in it to your Liberties; such Trustees are not liable to Curruption, as other Officers, in that you do (as it were) transmit and intrust them with your very Principles of self-Preservation, which are of that nature as never to alter their Sentiments, unless it be in the Dissolution of the subject, when all falls together. The Office seems a Creation, where your just and regular sympa∣thies, and Antipathies center by the Laws of na∣ture; that what you love, they love; what you hate, they hate; and being <HI>Ex Officio,</HI> of the stan∣ding watch and Guard, they will peculiarly Per∣sonate your selves upon every notable Crisis, and naturally Caring for your Affairs, will, like wake∣ful Sentinels, curiously and with Courage guard your Liberties.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="001660_0019_0FB4D7C5470EDAB0"/>Let Churches which are numerous and fuller of eminent Gifts, lead the way, and then excite and provoke their sister Churches to such Love and good Works for the advance of the Common Cause. There are without doubt, in these Churches, many private Members, worthy Per∣sons, suittably qualified for this Office, who (like some Edge-Tools heedlesly left to Rust out in oblivien) lie hid, yet, when found, and put to use, will prove themselves truly Eminent.</P>
<P>Let Christs Churches seek amongst their ne∣glected Hoards; for they are, without doubt, Church by Church, far Richer then they make for; There are, Indeed, Complaints of great Poverty, and of a Dearth and Scarcity of suitable men. But I presume it is done with great Injustice; and Complaints of this nature in these Churches, are but the Complaints of Servants that are full fed; and Relieve no case by Com∣plaining, but rather Reflect dishonour upon their good Master, who hath bought all and bestow'd enough, and also incur blame to themselves for not Improving those Talents for the advance of his Exchequer, which they themselves have wrapt up in a Napkin, and that in this case, by too much Symbolizing with the Carnal and Politick Men of the world, who to humour some by-ends (under the Masquerade of Indigent Persons) make themselves very poor, tho' God has given them great Riches, <HI>Prov</HI> 13 7. This is a true (tho' a serious Affirmation) That in our Consti∣tution and Principles, there is as plain a Precept,
<PB N="21" REF="001660_0020_0FB4D7C76246E700"/>
if not as great a Reason for this Officer, as for any other in our Churches; and yet, as to matter of fact, we find it to be <HI>rara Avis in Jerva,</HI> like a blak Swan in the Meadow; and tho' the whole species is not quite rooted out, yet it is grown very rare to find one Individual.</P>
<P>Now the fault must be some where, and I am Satisfied, our Poverty is least to blame.</P>
<P>That some body or another must needs be Culp∣able, on the Account of this great omission, may I without offence issue out search and inquest, to know who is to blame, upon this failure whether Brethren, or Publick Officers, or whole Churches?</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. Private Brethren.</HEAD>
<P>MAy not the blame be laid in some Cases and in some Churches, upon some very capable Christian Gentlemen, who tho' not Incumbred (for the Publick) with any other Incoherent ser∣vice, yet are possibly too shy of this Trust, when offered to them? It must needs be acknow∣ledged, the Office is almost Perfectly a piece of Mortification and Self-Denyal; there is no pro∣vision in it to feed Ambition, or feast any other Lust; all is full of watching and Painfulness, and the Reward and Wages quite out of sight. But how ever in such Examples, whether Persons so qualified and so called ought not to comply, or themselves hear the Blame.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly</HI> The Terms of Christs Kingdom are very

<P>MAy not the Ordained Officers, in some Cases and in some Churches, be taxed or blamed, for this great Omission? such as out of Trimidity and Distrust, Jealous <HI>Ruling Elders,</HI> least they should instead of Colleagues prove Corrivals in the Exercise of their own Trust and Authority, for being men not of such deep learning, yet may prove so fortified with Friends, and so po∣pular, as that they may be capable to over-top men of greater Learning, and wiser Principles of Conduct in all Administrations.</P>
<P>Now if any of Christs Churches are vacated of this Officer by such Jealousies as these, or of the like nature, can the officers be without Blame? &amp; if so, then whether the first born Son may not justly Imprecate future Barreness on his own Mo∣thers Womb, for fear lest he should be supplant∣ed of the Inheritance, by the next Son or Brother born of the same ventre?</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly</HI> Such Officers as may plead their own par∣ticular Conscience and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, against the Office, as being of a doubtful Original, or of an uncertain Institution, and therefore make bold to over Rule our plain Precept for it, and the
<PB N="23" REF="001660_0022_0FB4D7CC0B00BDF0"/>
Church submits: whether is not a great Blame here?</P>
<P>It seems apparent by all Rules of Order and Goverment, That this is <HI>too to soveraign in the one, and too Servile and Careless in the other.</HI></P>
<P>For that no Officers particular Conscience must be a Rule to govern any particular Church, contrary to the Churches own Law, or Rule of Establishment; For if it be, then the Churches must have as many distinct Charters and Diffe∣ring Books of Canons, as their Pastors have Dif∣fering Consciences; which is a plain in-let to all Sorts of Confusion.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly</HI> Such Officers who plead the custome of the Churches, and so make the Illegal Omissions of some, a sanctuary for the same Fault in others; but whether this Plea from Custom will hold Officers exempt from blame, when weighed in a Just Ballance? Custom is Justly allowed a great Conqueror in the World, it subdues whole King∣doms to its Empire, and all men submit and adhere to its Demands and Dictates, as to an Oracle? But then it must be Custom that is Honourable, Laudable, and Uninterrupted, otherways a Cu∣stom which continually crosses a plain Precept is very Culpable, and contracts a long series of Guilt, and may expect to be persued with a tedious train of sad Consequence, altho it should with much presumption wipe its mouth and say, <HI>I am Inno∣cent.</HI> Therefore custom is no Plea in this case, but rather renders all who depend upon it, to be reduced to a Desperate Posture in their thoughts
<PB N="24" REF="001660_0023_0FB4D7CD85D4E798"/>
and Arguments; for tho' there is a Customary Omission, that hath prevailed in the Churches to a fad Degree, as to this Office, yet the Omission has all a long crossed a Precept, and has been Confronted by the Custom of other Churches in the Land, who have attended their duty; so that those Churches who have Maintained the Practice <HI>have kept lawful possession of the Right,</HI> and the Title being matter of Record, and founded in Law, there Remains no shelter here from Custom for Delinquints.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whether those Officers are Justifiable, who honour the Office, yet do honestly &amp; uprightly think that the narrow Extent of Territory may (as to many Churches) serve as a supersedeas to the Of∣fice? For what need of so many great Commis∣sions in so small Bodies? But whether small Churches have not great Work belonging to them, sufficient to Improve a full Compleat set of Of∣ficers, and possibly, all little enough to do the work Well, if the nature and extent of it be rightly considered and faithfully mannaged; for who is sufficient for these things?</P>

<P>WHether the Churches, as incorporate Bodies, are free from Blame when they don't Re∣gularly indeavour to compleat themselves in all Offices, and prosecute their Claim to this with Effect?</P>
<P>The Ruling Elders are the Churches Previledge, and a very great Right, on which their well-being
<PB N="25" REF="001660_0024_0FB4D7CF04DFDD20"/>
and stability does much depend, and the great Omission in the Country has probably brought things to that posture of sickleness as we now find them at? then whether the Churches can be exempt from Blame, when they suffer such vacancies to continue, when it is in the Power of their hands to Remedy it?</P>
<P>Here indeed is a great Question Commencing, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Question</HI> 1. Whether any Church can Possibly, and according to Rules of Order, Proceed to elect Ruling Elders, when other of their Officers in actual Rule and Trust, shall refuse to call and Guide the Church in the Choice?</P>
<P>I shall indeed Transgress the bounds of my own intentions, and the Civility of an Epistle, if <HI>I</HI> should now undertake a full and compleat answer to this Question.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> shall therefore at present only just Index the Principal Titles or Heads for Answer, by Pointing briefly at the Duties of Officers, and the preroga∣tives of the Churches in the Case.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is most apparent through the whole Ministry of the World (unless in absolute Monarchies) that it is the duty of all Publick officers to Mini∣ster according to the plain Rules of the Publick state, and not by their own Phancy or Wills, and so in this case, the chief Ruling Officers (then in being) <HI>In point of Conduct are obliged to lead the Church</HI> in their Operations, according to the Churches plain and settled Principles, And not reluct because their own perswasions do otherwise incline them▪
<PB N="26" REF="001660_0025_0FB4D7D084E7F370"/>
It is now plainly too late for any Officer to pretend Conscince against Established Rules: This Object∣ion should have been made before they had taken Office. But now it is out of Season, for they were Elected and Ordained to Govern the Church not by their own thoughts, as the Rule, but by the <HI>Churches</HI> Cannon, and that by their own con∣sent, when they took Office. And moreover, this is most evident, that if such Powers which belong to the inside of mens being, <HI>viz.</HI> their Hearts, Phansies, Notions, Judgments, Imagina∣tions or Consciences, call them by what names you please, or let the Owners freely fix the Titles (the odds is not great) Now if these are to be the Rule of Churches, then Pastors and Ruling Offi∣cers have (in their degree) as absolute a Dominion over the Churches, as the great <HI>Turke</HI> has over his Bashaws, and other Vassals.</P>
<P>But I hope, none here will claim this Dominion. And if not, then let Pastors and Teachers do their Duty in point of Conduct (if the Churches are not Remiss in theirs) and this great vacancy may be soon supplyed, and there is also a Relief for Officers, if their just prerogatives are any ways toucht by the the Traverse.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> To Confine the discourse to this present Example, and to shorten terms, for brevities sake, it must be granted, that any perticular Officer sensible of his duty, that shall undertake to grati∣fie and lead the Church, in the Election and choice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This makes the case very easy in point of Conduct▪ Yea, tho' other Officers in the same
<PB N="27" REF="001660_0026_0FB4D7D2EDFC6A48"/>
Church should either oppose or not act. For that any one Officer in a Church, where there may be many of the same nature, he himself is vertually the whole Colledge of Officers in any Office-Act that he performs without them. As in civil Affairs, a particular Executor so far sustains the whole Executorship, as that he can make a vallid Act in that Ministry, though many others are joyned with him in the same Testament, &amp; yet don't nor won't Act with him, in this or that affair, tho' confirmed in their Trust; which Principle is foun∣ded in the nature of a joynt Tenancy in general, and in a joynt Trust in particular, held by many Equals.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> The case is very difficult when the standing Officers joyn as one man, and will not guide the Church in these Elections referred to, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And I must needs say, I fear here has been the great bar to this Office.</P>
<P>We may from Interest, as well as Duty, Ration∣ally suppose the Inclinations of the Churches, and the desires of many of them have been made known by repeated &amp; honorable Solicitations, there∣in, saying to <HI>Arcipus, Fulfill thy Ministry Co.</HI> 4.17. &amp; we may also affirm, the Principle is plain, the Office is acknowledged, at home and abroad to be of Divine <HI>Original.</HI> but however this is certain, it is a formal establishment by these Churches, and not now to be Disputed. Yet the Officers pretend, they see no Reason to give way to the Churches Desire or Demands, neither will the conduct in this Case, though their Duty does oblige, that so
<PB N="28" REF="001660_0027_0FB4D7D444F68200"/>
the Church may be compleated in its Officers; No! they are pleased by Acts of a Superintending Pow∣er, to lock the Church Door, and turn this Key against the Office, and no Pleas or Perswasions can alter their resolutions. But hereby the Offi∣cers do plainly abdicate their Office, by changing the Acts of a limited trust, bounded by precept into what is meerly Abitrary; so in a Decree, they break up the Relation between themselves and the Church, And by such an Essential Error so con∣trary to the Churches Charter and their own Com∣mission they forfeit all at once, though Lenity and Mercy may favour them with a long life; Yet in the Eye of Justice they are Dead men, if not in nature yet in Law, And upon their <HI>OBSTINACY</HI> may justly be <HI>DEGRADED.</HI> Therefore in such a case, when it comes to that Extremity, the Churches may and ought to call in Council and <HI>Proceed in their work and Duty for their own Well being,</HI> after the manner of an Inorganick <HI>Church Platform, Chap.</HI> 10 and this I need not stand to discribe, our Plat-form, The Laws of the Province and the Practice of the Churches in other Cases, and vacancies will do it.</P>
<P>Then whether these Congregational Churches thro' these Provinces may not justly reflect Blame upon themselves, for too Supine and negligent a frame of Spirit, towards so Great an Interest, and so noble an Office, seeing they have such a share in Government, and can fairly Rescue themselves and their own Rights, by the Power and Prin∣ciples of their own Essence, when their other Officers neglect Duty?</P>

<P><HI>THat you will please to Revise the study (and in order to it) a New impression of your</HI> Plat-form.</P>
<P>It is very usual for many Gentlemen in your Country, Landed men, and men of Estates, every man to keep his Law-Book by him, as his Bible, the Bible for the solace of his Mind, and the Law-Book for the safety of his Estate, that upon any Defamation of Title, or other Incroachments, when his Lands and Properties are in hazard, he may know whither to repair for his Direction, and how to make his Defence. And so methinks it should be with the Members of the Churches, as to their stated Rights by their Cannon Law! That there should be a kind of a Penalty (if the hazard in such a defect be not punishment enough) on such Delinquents, as live Members of Christs visible Kingdom here, and yet live without the <HI>Plat-Form,</HI> the Ecclesiastical Political Charter of these Churches.</P>
<P>I must needs say, and I wish I could whis∣per it so low that the Echo might never Rebound to <HI>Gath</HI> or <HI>Askelon,</HI> and yet be distinctly heard thro' these Churches) That I fear the Impression of the <HI>Platform</HI> is almost Extinct, if not quite worn out in the Country. And that as it was said in the day of Battle, under King <HI>Saul, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the People,</HI> so here, tho' your Bible, which is the sword of the spirit, is in every mans hand
<PB N="30" REF="001660_0029_0FB4DA44003B0178"/>
yet possibly, this Spear or necessary weapon, in the defence of your Gospel Liberties, is scarce to be found in the hands of one in a Thousand, thro' all the host of <HI>Israel.</HI> I do therefore advise my Country, and these Churches, to furnish your selves, and that you would encourage the Statio∣ners, in this Design, and they can soon Recruit you. <HI>My Honourable and Dearest Friends</HI>!</P>
<P>If we are push't on to Battle, and our Weapons then in the Oar, we may Justly suspect we shall be but too easy and cheap a Conquest for Assailants. Therefore furnish your selves in good time with this piece of Artillary, that you may be well fixt and equipt for Service.</P>
<P>Don't you hear from the top of yonder Proud and Lofty Mountain, the Enemies Trumpets, and their Drums Beating a Preparative? There∣fore let all the good Souldiers of Christ be Com∣pleat in this and all other parts of their Armour, and at an hours warning, unless you reckon your Treasure not worth Defending.</P>

<P>THe Nobleness of Parentage, by the Laws of Honour, entales on Posterity (with other Rights) a protection from all incivilities, but not from the austere Demands of Justice, when that is affronted and violated. Justice keeping the Golden Rule (<HI>Quo dat Suum Cuique</HI>) observes no other Destinctions, than what it first makes in its Distributions amongst the Rich and Poor, the Noble and Ig∣noble, it is no Respecter of Persons, for that it is Superiour to all men, and sits as a veiled Empress holding the Ballance to weigh out equal to each one according to the Merits of the cause, and sees no man.</P>
<P>There being now under Cognisance, such as are of honourable Families, yet arrested and brought by due course of Law to <HI>Answer for high Crimes,</HI> it must not be supposed Rudeness in Manners, though they be some-what freely and Rusly handled, whilst the prosecution is held agreeable with the Impeachment and Rule of Justice.

<P>Therefore, tho' in the following pages there may be discerned a great Liberty in Argument, with a mixture of Satyres, as tho' none by my Inferiours were Involved in the Charge, Yet ascribe it unto my love and veneration for so great an Interest as I appear for, and not to any base intent of sinking the honour or darkning the Luster of better Men.

<P>Whether the Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> are not fairly in Possession of a Form of Government, by which they are distinguished from most of the Reformed Churches in the World, more then by their Grace? and if so (which no man that knows them will deny) Then it must be some superiour Power, or their Own voluntary Act, regularly obtained, that must out or dispossess them. Did an Equal Claimer appear, yet long and quiet Possession holds against a Writ of Ejectment, a very strong Plea in the Sessions, both of Rea∣son and Law, according to that acknowledged Maxim, <HI>in Requali Jure, melior est Conditio Possi∣dentis,</HI> When two plead an Equal Right, he is in the best Condition who is in Possession; Then it can be no less then a very Indisputable Right, and duely prosecuted with Effect, that can Dispos∣sess these Churches of their Government.</P>

<HEAD><HI>2</HI>d. Query.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Wheither length of time has Discovered any Essential Error in the Government of these Churches?</HI></P>
<P>And 1<HI>st.</HI> it has, or 2<HI>dly</HI> it has not.</P>
<P N="1">1. If time has made any such Discovery, yet the Proposals have not been so fair as to detect it, or describe wherein, or in what Respect. The Great service these Churches, with their Govern∣ment, have done, in subduing and Beautifying a wilderness, bespeaks some considerable Respect from all men, who value Wisdom or Piety; That it must needs seem a harsh piece of Justice, with or without any formal Tryal, for them to be driven from Plenty, and sent to the Doors of their own Tenants to Beg for a Booty, out of that Estate which was once their own: at least, by a seisin in fact, if not in Law; For that the Proposals Kill, and take Possession with far less Ceremony or Legal Formalities, Than <HI>Ahab</HI> did in gaining the Right of <HI>Naboth's</HI> Vineyard; when, if there is any Essential Error in their Frame or Constitu∣tion, &amp; that they have either Ignorantly or Trea∣cherously assumed any peculiar Prerogative, which belongs to Christ Throne, as King, that was never their due to possess (and so being con∣sidered as Usurpers, are dead in Law) yet not∣withstanding it would not have Offended a∣gainst the Laws of Gratitude in sending them to their Graves, to have put some more Marks of Honour upon them, by certain solemn and
<PB N="39" REF="001660_0038_0FB4DA68E5141890"/>
usual forms of Tryal in the Prologue of their Dissolution; for they have been certainly great and good Servants to the Publick, that if they deserve to dye, they ought to dye under all the Marks of Honour which Justice can allow of, at the least a Grand Sessions, a Jury and Liberty to make Plea in their Own Defence, and under the Influence of Royal Council, should have been Granted, unless they may be treated as Con∣querours serve unfortunate Pyrates, who when taken, are without form of Law hung up at the Yards Arm.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> But if no such discovery can be made, Whether it is a wise and just thing for men to alter their Government? The Churches of Christ in this Country have been in Possession of this form of Government, and it hath been estab∣lished by Certain or Legal and Orderly Familarities, and <HI>Ʋniversal Consent,</HI> and has continued upwards of three score Years. And as the poet says, <HI>Parvarios Casus, Per Tot Discrimina Rarum Tendemus In Caelum</HI>; They have passed various changes, and great Temptations, and yet to this day, by this Reason of Discipline have been kept as clean Swept, as any Churches of God in the World, and any such Imbroylments as have lately happned in the Churches, have been more the Folly of Ad∣ministrators, in not keeping to the Rules of Government, then from any Defect in the Con∣stitution. Then what reason have we to meditate a Change? No, Certainly; It will be more Divine, and agreeable with the Law of our Re∣ligious

<P><HI>Query,</HI> Whether the right Improvement will be to alter the Scheme of our Government or Disci∣pline, seeing no body else will do it for us? <HI>NO Surely</HI>!

<P><HI>Whether it be not great Boldness for any particular Gentlemen to Invade, null, Alter or Weaken so great a Right and Propriety, as is the Government of these Churches without their Consent?</HI></P>
<P>Government is the greatest Blessing in the World of of a worldy Nature; it is Felony, chea∣per by far to the Loosers to plunder men of
<PB N="41" REF="001660_0040_0FB4DA7C23CC17D0"/>
their Estate and wealth, nay, and of their Lives too then to dispoyl them of Government; for by the latter, you harass and worry them in the world, with Plagues and miseries, worse then death it self, that the basest is far better, then no Government; a churlish Tyranny, is better then an Insolent Anarchy, when men are with∣out Law, and all <HI>hail Fellows,</HI> not well but badly met. And for men to alter or warp Government, without all Interested parties are agreed, is a very bold Intrusion.</P>
<P>That, yea, that Government which is in any good measure formed, and dos agree with the nature freedom of Humane Beings, and adjusted by the Laws of wisdome and Honour, and plain inly, and fairly Established, is too much of God in the world, and too Great a Royalty be∣longing to men, for any to play the Knave or Fool with.</P>
<P>And when a Government hath done all things in the main well, and has Reapt in a great Stock of Blessings, now to Shuffle it out of Place, is Fickleness, and not Policy; for a sensible Series of Blessings will always attone for some see∣ming Defects in a Constitution.

<P>We must needs then enquire, <HI>From whence the</HI> Proposals <HI>derive their force?

So I come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To the more Critical Examination of the <HI>Proposals</HI> themselves, which I shall Attend,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. More Generally.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. More particularly, by taking a survey of them in their distinct Sections.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. More Generally, by Inquiring into their Original, and nature.</P>
<P N="1">1. By making a more Exact Inquest and search after their Original, and in this debate they for∣feit their Essence, unless they can derive their Essence, unless they can derive their Pedigree, either</P>
<P N="1">1. From Gods Immediate Inspiration. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. From Antient Revelation. Or,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="45" REF="001660_0044_0FB4DA8E0B5605F8"/>3. From Right Reason, which is a Ray of Divine Wisdom instampt upon Humane nature. Or,</P>
<P N="4">4. From the <HI>Platform</HI> of the Churches, which is a systim of Government, collected by our An∣cestors out of several Fountains, and Principally from the Scriptures. Now in pursuing this Distri∣bution, I shall diligently enquire, whether we can hear of their Original under any of these heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to Immediate Inspiration, I must needs presume, these Gentlemen will not dare to Assert, that they are sent Immediately from God with this Message to the Churches; they are too good and wise to pretend (with <HI>Enthusiasts</HI>) to Imme∣diate Vision, or a spirit of Prophecy; both the matter and manner of their writing sufficiently convinces, that these <HI>Proposals</HI> are their own Sen∣timents; they durst not put, a <HI>Thus saith the LORD</HI> upon them; such on Inscription is too Heavenly and Royal for such Coyn: for both they and we know, according to <HI>Dut.</HI> 30.12. it is not in Heaven, that thou shouldest say, who shall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may know and do it? there is no need to send Messengers to that Court, to learn by Immediate and Extraordinary Information, either the Laws of our Duty or Interest; for that God hath made all things sufficiently plain, by this Time of day, either by Scripture or Rea∣son, for the Conduct and Government of his Churches, yea, of the subjects of his Universal
<PB N="46" REF="001660_0045_0FB4DA90D4809C88"/>
Intellectual MONARCHY in this World.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the Antient Revelation; Holy Scrip∣ture, that best, tho' not the bigest of Books, is the saints Library, and the Clergy-mans Pandects, whence he takes the Rules for the Mannagment of his Trust; so that it is very Amusing that the Bible should be forgotten in Drawing up such Schemes as these; as tho' the usage of the Popes Conclave, which turns the Bible out of doors for a Wrangler, and gives the chief Seal to Tradition, &amp;c. were here in fashion. Indeed, I cannot but esteem them very unfortu∣nate Proposals to be turned so naked into the World, as not to have the least tincture of Scrip∣ture to Gaurd them from Contempt; no, not so much as a Citation, that might admit of so much as a strained Consequence in their Defence. And so, tho' less Prophane, yet they are also less Politick then the most desperate of Hereticks, who alwayes bring their Errors on the stage guard∣ed with Scriptures, and craftily Indeavour to make their Citations look with such an aspect, as tho' they were encampt on their side. But here we have nothing for our Faith to lean on, but so many austerer <HI>Ipse Dixits,</HI> as bitter Pills of Death for the Churches to Swallow, without any of the Confection of Heaven or the Sweet Manna Sprink∣led upon them; or else only so many naked Humane Persumptions, as Arrows or Bolts, too Rashly shot out against the sides of our Churches, and no word of Scripture to Tip or feather them. Nay, it is very Memorable, and I account fatal,
<PB N="47" REF="001660_0046_0FB4DA9264D031C0"/>
and to be observed, that GOD, that secret Title of the Almighty, with which the Holy Scripture does so abound, is not once named (as I can find) in the whole Treatise; as tho' the most sacred Titles, as well as Sections of that heavenly Book, would move Fears and irritate Jealousies, rather then pouer down Solace and Comfort upon this Undertaking. Therefore, in a word, the whole Bible is thrown by as a Sealed Parchment, or as one that never Prophecies good to such Adventurers. Therefore these <HI>Proposals</HI> being apprehended as Sea Rovers, and Indicted upon the <HI>statute of Pyracy,</HI> and upon Examination being found without the Prince of Princes Colours and yet doing great mischief, in Assaulting and Wounding his Chur∣ches and Lawful Subjects, on their honest occasion, being bound on a Voyage to their own Country, they can no ways in Justice escape, but must Pass under the Sentence, and endure the Pains of Death, for they were taken Fighting without Commission.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>As to REASONS.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Recta Ratio,</HI> Right Reason, that great Oracle in Humane Affairs is the Soul of Man, so formed or endowed by Creation with a certain Sagacity or Acumen (in many perticular Examples sharp∣ned by the constitution of nature, by Grace and study) whereby mans Intellect is inabled to take up (<HI>pro Medulo</HI> or in a degree) the true Idea or Per∣ception of things, agreeable with and according
<PB N="48" REF="001660_0047_0FB4DA9BB3D4BCE0"/>
to their Natures. So that if we bring these Pro∣posals under Examination by the Laws of Reason, we must enquire whether they are agreeable with the nature and Constitution of the Churches, if they fully harmonize with their Principles of Es∣sence, then they may be enroled for Canons; but if they Jar and are plainly Repugnant, we may then Lawfully censure them, and pronounce them Irrational. Whether these Churches are consti∣tuted by Scripture or Reason, yea or no, that is not our Question, but being of such a Frame or Constitution, as they now are, and always have been, all who pretend to Support and preserve them, and yet take such measures, as will utterly overthrow and dissolve them, such Repairers have apparently deserted the Dictates and Government of Right Reason.</P>
<P>And here we may Collect an Induction of some few hints of certain particulars for Evidence; the Platform Asserts a Classes to be no Gospel form of Church Order; <HI>The Proposals say it is,</HI> or they abuse our Credulity. <HI>The Proposals Order the Association to have the first Cognizance of Church Cases</HI>; our Government says, No, it be∣longs to the Jurisdiction of particular Churches. The Proposals give Power to the Association to limit Elections, and to Direct them; but our Government says, No, it will not Consent; the Election of Officers is the Prerogative of the Churches, and they wont, as yet, part with it, &amp;c. So that when we can by the Rules of Grammer Resolve yea or no, yea or nay, to
<PB N="49" REF="001660_0048_0FB4DA9F5A905E88"/>
be the same voice and word, then you may Reconcile the <HI>Proposals</HI> and the <HI>Plat-form</HI>; that Certainly whatever there be of Religion, the Method is apperantly Disagreeable with Com∣mon Reason.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>As to the PLAT-FORM.</HI></P>
<P>I shall represent it by a kind of a short <HI>Prosopop<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> thus, <HI>viz.</HI> enquiring whether the Proposals are de∣duced from this fountain, the <HI>Plat-form</HI> with all its Chapters, and with one joynt Consent, as plain as the Tongue in their heads can utter it, say, that never since it Possest the Government, so much as Dream'd of them. It may say with destruction (<HI>Job</HI> 28.22.) we have heard of the Fame of these things, with our Ears, but never Imagined so much as a seminal vertue in our own being, for their Procreation, but rather starts with the News of their approach, out of fear of its own Dissoluti∣on from their Repugnant and formidable nature. Therefore as in a grievous fright, from Surprize, Crys out with <HI>Athaliah, Treason, Treason</HI>! And Begs that Zeal and Conscience, those two Solici∣tors for the Crown, will at this Grand Court of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer</HI> Implead and Prosecute them as Traytors to the Prince of Peace, and Fellons to these Churches, Christs Loyal Subjects. So I come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To enquire into the nature of these <HI>Pro∣posals,</HI> by Surveying their Composition and Properties.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st. Their Composition.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="001660_0049_0FB4DAA51D205838"/>They seem a Conjunction of almost all the Church Governments in the World, and the least part is Congregational. Indeed at the first Cast of the Eye, the Scheme seems to be the <HI>Spectre Ghost of Presbiterianism,</HI> or the Government or of the Church by Classes; Yet, if I don't mistake, in Intention there is something Considerable of <HI>Prelacy</HI> in it, only the distinct Courts of <HI>Bishop</HI> with the <HI>Steeples</HI> of the <HI>Churches, Tythes, Surplice</HI> and other Ornaments, do not shew themselves so visible, as to be discerned at the first look; yet with a Microscope you may easily discern them really to be there in <HI>Embrio, Et in Rera nature</HI>; for this is a known Maxim, <HI>Quod necessario Subintelligitar non Deest,</HI> What is necessarily understood, or lies hid in the Intention of a Design, is Really here, by just Interpretation; Therefore these Proposals <HI>which dare Revolt so far at a step,</HI> as these have done, must needs understand no less in their aim, than of an Enobling Government for Clergy-men, which our Princes and Parliaments have adorned the Churches with. This seems Rational, that those which never stick at Robbing the Churches of such an Immence Treasure, as the Proposals carry off, will <HI>never stand, Shall we! Shall we! at the offer of a Bishoprick,</HI> which is a Barrony with all its Rights and Royal Appurtenancies.</P>
<P>There is also something in it which <HI>Smells very strong of the Infallible Chair,</HI> To Assume the Power of making Rules, to Ingross all Principles of Process, The Right of Election, the last Appeal, The Negative Vote, and all Super-Intending
<PB N="51" REF="001660_0050_0FB4DAA7FB339BF0"/>
Power in Matters Ecclesiastick, as the Prerogatives of Clergy-men, Distinct from all other Estates and Ministers in Government; or thus for the Clergy to Monopolize both the Legislative and Executive part of Cannon Law, is but a few steps from tht Chair of universal Pestilence, and by the Ladders here set up, <HI>Clergy-men</HI> may, if they please, Clamber thus high, for when they are invested with what is in these Proposals provided and intended for them, who then can controul them but the Almighty himself? as was said of those daring men, <HI>Gen.</HI> 11.6. And now no∣thing will be Restrained from them which they have Imagined to do; for who can now with-hold from them Infallibility, or stop the Direful and Definitive Sentence? Who can limit their Power or shorten their Arm in their Executions? Their Bulls can now, upon any any affront, Bellow and Thunder out a Thousand terrible Curses, and the poor affrighted and Invassal'd Layity, both Princes and Subjects (being here as in the grave put under one and the same Topick) must forfeit their Salvation, if they don't tamely submit, and obediently become their Executioners; for that it is now evident that all Power is, if not Really given, yet formally stollen, and in Intent Bequeathed to them.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly. Their Properties.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st Property,</HI> is <HI>Disorder</HI> Order is both the Beauty and safety of Universe, take aside the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="52" REF="001660_0051_0FB4DAA8F79CDCB8"/>
whereby the whole hangs to gether, the great Frame of nature is unpin'd and drops piece from piece; and out of a Beautiful structure we have a Chaos. These Proposals are therefore very mis∣chievous, if not in matter, yet in the manner of Production; they are full of Disorder, being things born out of due time, their Conception is without Countinance, from the Rule of Order. Indeed there is no Statute to be found that will justify the first Coitus of Parents, neither will any allow their Social Life; that the Birth must bear the Attender, of being both begotten and Born, out of Lawful Wedlock, and so in Point of Honour fall under the Censure of the <HI>Levitical Law,</HI> and must be kept back from Promotion, for <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. <HI>A Bastard shall not enter into the Congrega∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>That to pass all other Remarks, if we are under mistake in the assertions, I then demand and enquire, Where is that Lawful Authority which Published Legal Banes, with the Consent of all the Interested Persons, and the regular Consuma∣tion of the Match? If any Rule can be found to shelter and Honour the Conception and Birth, let it be produced, and it escaping other Felonies with Life, this Scandal shall be taken off, but otherwise it must remain as a Bar to the tenth Generation.</P>
<P>The 2<HI>d Properity</HI> Is <HI>Ʋsurpation.</HI> The Proposals Apparently Usurp the Churches Prerogatives. It has been asserted, and it is true, These Churches have been Settled upon the Plat-form of their own
<PB N="53" REF="001660_0052_0FB4DAAC8215AD18"/>
Government for upwards of <HI>Sixty Years</HI>; they have often Revised and Re-inforc'd the Establish∣ment, both as the Principles of their Consociation and Union in General, and the Form of Govern∣ment for every Church in particular. Then, for these Proposals without Licence to assume a Legislation, and form a Government, so repug∣nant to their own, can be no less then Usurping a Dominion over them, contrary to the Rule, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3. neither as being Lords over Gods Heritage. Lesser Acts against Empire hath cost many a bold man his head; What! for a <HI>parti∣cular kno<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Juncto of Gentlemen to make so bold with a settled Government, as to pick out all the Enobling Royalties, Liberties and Enfranchizements in it, and Sacrifice them to their own Ambition</HI>! It is enough to put mankind into an Uproar.</P>
<P>It is fresh in Memory, that when some of our English Princes (and one would think, if any men may, they may be allowed to aspire, yet when they) have Presumed on less things than these Proposals reach after, in gratifying their Aim at an Absolute Monarchy, when as they have not dared to lay out with such freedom, a new Form of Government, with a wide mouth, ga∣ping to devour the <HI>English Liberties,</HI> (as these Proposals do the Churches, but only with much secrecy, covin and Pollicy, they have by some more Clandestine measures been Intruding upon the antient Liberties of the English Nation) Every one knows what direful Convultions this has bred in the Bowels of the Kingdom. And may it not
<PB N="54" REF="001660_0053_0FB4DAB4B1E2B8B0"/>
serve to enliven this Plea? To invite all such who are with <HI>Plato,</HI> Owners of a great Genius at Inven∣ting new or Modeling old Governments, to try their Skill in altering the English Monarchy, and see how it will be Probated. That is, suppose you should venture to Interdict the <HI>Royal Assent,</HI> or Convert the present Monarch into a Duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> or dissolve the Lords in Parliament or (rather in Harmony with this Scheme) Turn the Burgesses and Knights of the Shires (as a sort of men not fit for Politicks in Parliament) out of doors? And whether our Soveraign, the Peerage, or Subjects of English Liberties would take it well? And whether Christian men may make Bolder with the Established Government of Christs Churches, then with that which belongs to Civil Affairs? In Honour to the <HI>New-England Churches,</HI> and with veneration for the <HI>English Monarchy,</HI> I dare assert, that there is in the Con∣stitution of our Church Government more of the English Civil Government in it, and it has a bet∣ter Complexion to suit the true English Spirit, than is in the <HI>English Church,</HI> or any other, both as to the Legislative and Executive part of Go∣vernment. Indeed, considering how things are at home in Church and State, I have been some∣times ready to Query, Why the Nation should be so Enamored with their Civil, and yet so Careless and Regardless of their Gospel Liber∣ties, so as to Trust their Consciences with their Clergy, more immediately, and yet won't ven∣ture their Estates with their Learned Judges,
<PB N="55" REF="001660_0054_0FB4DAB89344A1E8"/>
without the Priviledge and Mediation of Juries; as tho' they were more careful and wise in securing their Estates than their Souls, and valued one far more then the other. But I shall go on with the Comparison.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>Legislation</HI>; Our New-England Convocation admits, and the Government does profess the fraternity as necessary to the being of all Synodical Assemblies, that as far as Legis∣lation, spiritual, is left to men, and as they have a great Treasure, <HI>viz.</HI> Their <HI>Salvation</HI> Imbarqued, so they have a great Interest in the Management of it; and herein they agree with the English Caution and Wisdom, in the Modes of Civil Government of the Empire; for the Commons are one great state in the Civil Legislation; and as they have a great Power in the mannagement of that Great Trust.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to <HI>Administration</HI> or the <HI>Executive</HI> part of <HI>Government,</HI> Our <HI>New-England Government</HI> grants a Jurisdical Power to the Fraternity <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> makes them proper Judges in all Ecclesiastical Cases and Administrations, on Persons Cogni∣zable, or that must pass a Tryal <HI>Juridice</HI>; which is agreeable with the Constitution, Nature and Practice of the Civil Government of the Empire; for under the Prosecutions of Law, no <HI>English Subject,</HI> in Life, Limb or Estate, must be past upon, but by the Judgment of his <HI>PEERS</HI>; Yea, in all Pleas of the Crown, such Confidence has the Government put in the Loyalty and Discre∣tion of the Commons, that our English Juries are
<PB N="56" REF="001660_0055_0FB4DABA07CBCDC8"/>
stated Arbitarors and Umpires between our Prince and his Subjects. Yea, such a dependance has the whole Nation in Keeping these Liberties in their own hands, that they Reckon the <HI>Commons in Parliament</HI> and <HI>Juries</HI> in the <HI>Common Wealth,</HI> to be the great Pillars of English Honour and Liberties, and they esteem them as Ramparts built by the Wisdom of our Ancesters, to Defend us from Tyranny and Slavery.</P>
<P>That considering the affinity in these two Constitutions, one would be ready to Query, Whether the Heroick true English Spirit is not Parent to both? Or whether they are not equal Debtors to the Gospel, for their Original? The Improvement of this comparison is briefly this; Suppose some of the great Ministers of State should venture to sweep away all those Civil En∣franchizements which are <HI>English-mens</HI> Birth-Right, and set up an Arbitrary Power, with a pretence of doing Justice and Judgment in the Kingdom, by more concise and expedient Mea∣sures, whether they might not be seized? And whether the Statutes would not be Chain strong enough to hold them, as <HI>Traytors</HI> to a well for∣med Government, and then laid fast by a Mitti∣mus for great Usurpers? And whether the Plea will not hold in Just Proportions, on the <HI>other side of the Comparison</HI>?</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d. Property Riotous.</HI> The nature of <HI>a Riot</HI> may (in part) be thus described, it is an <HI>Ʋnlawful Assembly of more than three met in one place to do an Ʋnlawful Ast,</HI> as violently breaking down of
<PB N="57" REF="001660_0056_0FB4DABE1D42E010"/>
Walls, and pulling up of Hedges, and wrongfully entering into mens Rights and Possession, and that in a fray and Terror of the People. In managing this Plea, I shall only desire that the Illegality of the Assembly which formed these Proposals, with the Objects and things they intend, and the ancient Boundaries which they plainly Invade, to∣gether with the fearful apprehensions that many good and sober People in the Vicinage have con∣cerning the Enterprize, may be Critically exa∣mined, and I doubt not but when we obtain the suffrage of this Honourable Court, it will <HI>Determine, The Impleaded Criminals are of a Riotous nature, and so the INDICTMENT will stand</HI> more valed against them.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th. Property, Sacriligious, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5<HI>th. Property, Rebellious.</HI></P>
<P>It grieves me to utter the Epethites agreeable with the Nature of these proposals; yet they must Blame their own Nature, but not my Justice, if <HI>I</HI> give them but their due; for I find them in the breach of a Royal Statute, yea, I think of a Penal Law. This is plain, <HI>They take away the Liberties, Priviledges, Discipline and Government of these Churches, all which are Established to them by the Law; and that not only by their own Cannons, but by the Laws of this Province,</HI> as by a <HI>Royal Magna Charta, viz.</HI> in an Act for the Settlement and Support of the Ministers, pag. 3. in these words,
<Q><HI>The Respective Churches in the several Towns with∣in this Province shall at all times hereafter use, exercise and enjoy all their Priviledges and Freedoms Respec∣ting
<PB N="58" REF="001660_0057_0FB4DAC091915468"/>
Divine Worship, Church Order, and Discipline, and shall be encouraged in the Peaceable and Regular Profession and Practice thereof.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This Act (as one says on the great Charter of <HI>English Liberties</HI>) Deserves to be <HI>written in letters of Gold,</HI> and hung up in all our Houses of Gods Publick Worship, to signalize the Zeal (in the Presence of God, Angels, and Men) of the Au∣thority of the Throne and Empire, for the Establishing of these Churches, and Christs In∣terest in them. Now, Considering that the Power, Pollicy, and Grace of the English Crown, should <HI>Thus lock up the Churches Treasure for them,</HI> and set such a Centinal, with the flaming Sword of Justice in its hand, to Dread and Awe Intrudeeis, it must needs be a very bold Action, (if it ben't Plump Rebellion) to Attempt or de∣sign such a Sequestration or Imbezellment as <HI>the proposals DO.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6<HI>th. Property, Ʋnfaithfullness,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>th. Property, Ingratitude.</HI></P>
<P>For the Stewards of great Families, when Advanced to Honour and a Profitable Trust, by the free Election and Grace of Noble-Men, when their Lords are laid down to rest, and sleep too securely, or are gone out of Town, with this presumption, that their Estate is secure, it being put under the care of Loyal Trustees and Thank∣ful Servants; Now for such Trustees and Stew∣ards, upon such opportunities to Pocket up or load away the Riches of the Family, and set up for themselves, and leave the Proprie∣tors

for the next, especially when they may get as well to Heaven without carrying such Packs along the Road? It has been universally the hu∣mour of mankind, according to the Laws of Nations and Nature, when Roused by the Regu∣lar Dictates of Self-Love, to endeavour that every following Generation might be more light∣some, free, noble and happy than that which did immediately preceed.</P>
<P>They say, the <HI>Chinees</HI> dig Clay and use it not, but leave it heapt, or in Pits, mellowing for the next Age. Every Prudent man builds his House for Duration. The Prince enlarges and betters his Dominions. The Peasant sweats to advance his Estate, and then each leaves all in Greater Triumph to their Heirs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kentish Yeomantry</HI> are had in honour to this day, for not stooping to the Conqueror, till they had Conditioned, and thereby secured their fair Estates of Lands in Fee and Free-holds forever from all Forfeiture by Felony, according to their Country proverb,
<Q><L>The Father to the Bough,</L>
<L>The Son to the Plough.</L></Q>
Such is the Mercyful fore-sight of Mankind, and his charitable Care and fore cast for such as shall follow, tho' they may never be seen or Known by their wise Progenitors.</P>
<P>But here is plainly a Conspiracy very Hete∣rogenious to such Judicious Acts of Humane Providence; A Design plainly, if not perfectly to Enslave, yet to bring Posterity into a needless Vassalage and Thraledom.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="001660_0061_0FB4DACED29A5C10"/>This is an acknowledged verity amongst wise <HI>Statists,</HI> That that Monarch who has the Com∣mand of the Seas, can at his Pleasure Command any Maritime Country.

<P>Then, where abouts are we in our Politicks, when we have delivered up the Royalties that are Challenged? and in what a weak Capacity shall we leave Posterity in? Nay, these <HI>Vertuoso's</HI> themselves, seem to be hardened with the Ostrich against their Own Natural Issue, unless the thing would chance to spring up as quick as <HI>Jonas Goard,</HI> and hang as full of Pearls and Diamonds as the Sea and Rocks of <HI>India,</HI> and they themselves shall have the first shake, and fill all their Coffers, with this Harvest, or at least, that they are assured that they can and shall Entail their Offices as securely as their Lands, upon their own Children, as was the Order of Priesthood, and the Fashion of the house of Levi. But alas! these modes are all worn out, and made null; and such mens Sons, as we are now treating of, in with the Multitude, must carry their falling Equal share of the Common Load; that should the Project prevail, under their Mannagement, (might they but look up out of their Graves in about half an Age) They may complain in Elegy, after the manner of <HI>Virgil</HI> over his, <HI>Sic vos non vobis.

So these Gentlemen might e'en say, we have Contrived to greaten the Clergy, and with Bees have filled a Rich Hive, and Built a fair Nest well feathered, but our Posterity, we see, is never the warmer, nor will they lick their fingers of it; and not only so, but are the men that must make up the tenth Sheaf, and deliver the tenth Cock, Calf and Lamb unto others out of their poor Demesnes. And also it may Justly beget a mournful Remembrance in Posterity of their Parents, and make them often look with a sad Countenance upon their Fathers Graves, not because they are Dead, but because they had not ended their days sooner, <HI>viz.</HI> before this Scheme (so Oppressive and Cruel to their small Free-holds) had taken effect under their Mannage∣ment.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. THat the Ministers of the Country form themselves into Associations, that may meet at Proper times to consider such things as may properly lie before them.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> There is no doubt or question to be made but that the Ministers and Pastors of Christs Churches may meet in greater or lesser Numbers; for they are Masters of themselves, and no more
<PB N="64" REF="001660_0063_0FB4DAD699B42F58"/>
accountable how they spend their time than other men are, but to meet at certain times and places, as Political Incorporate Bodies, or in the form of Classes for the Exercise and Mannagement of Government, this must be determined by some Precept issued from a Legislative Power; and without this, such who give the advice and Ex∣hibit the Call, are very Dispotick and Arbitrary; and those who attend it are Servile in their Sub∣mission; for that there is no man in his right Wits will take this <HI>Honour unto himself, but he that is called of God as was</HI> Aaron, <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.4. The Offer or Invitation bids defiance to our Constitution; for our <HI>Plat-form</HI> denys the Classical State of the Church under Christ, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. <HI>Sect.</HI> 5. There∣fore this is a Daring Article, in the Criminals Case; and as it strikes at the Vitals of our Government, it must in the TRYAL bear weight accordingly.</P>
<P>Sect. <HI>And that each of these Associations have a Moderator for certain time, who shall continue till another be chosen, who may call them together upon Emergencies.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> What Limits shall be assigned for the Precincts of every distinct Association? Or may we conclude the best model is to follow the Civil Distinctions made by the Counties? And if so, then the Pastors of each Classis are scattered through a Territory of Twenty or Thirty Miles Square, more or less, and then it must needs follow that the Moderator, to discharge his duty, must
<PB N="65" REF="001660_0064_0FB4DAD818043568"/>
provide Messengers to Cite all these destinct Gentlemen upon any Emergency; But the great difficulty is, what kind of Messenger it must be, whether King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Tell-Tale-Bird may be trusted with matters of such Importance? whether the Moderator must Re-imburse him? Or must he go on his own cost, contrary to equity in the Law? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.7. <HI>Who goeth to War-fare on his own charge?</HI> It is apparently an Error that care hath not been taken to find Horse and Man and Baiting-places for both on this Journey, other∣wise for a Legislative Power to prescribe Charge∣able Offices and leave them destitute of a Tem∣poral Suport, they must of necessity dye to save Charges, or turn mendicants, or hope in their Travel to meet with the Prophets Juniper-Tree; all which are as disagreeing with good Reason as the Proposal it self.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Moderater has an unlimited Power during the Prorogation of the Assembly, (1.) He must Judge of Emergencies, that he may Summon the Members; and being left vested with such a Prerogative, if after he has made his Citation, he Recants, he can then Countermand his own Order, though the Gentlemen should be all mounted, and ready to move. (2) If there chance to be an Emergence of Common Concern∣ment, If he finds his own Favourites involved in the guilt and Danger, he then gives no notice, but stiffles the business, and so cheats the Company. (3.) And upon any disgust, it is now at his Mercy to null the whole Frame; for he must be in place
<PB N="66" REF="001660_0065_0FB4DADA1F420788"/>
till another be chosen, and how will they get together, if he will not give the word? unless they are Creators of themselves the second time, as they were the first. That to institute such Charitable Designs without a Fund, and tye such Trust and Dominion on the Shoulders of men after such a lax and careless manner, and leave them at such loose Ends, as easily to make Fools of men, for my own part, I slight such Methods in Government.</P>

<P>I suppose there is no intent to erect a young or Mock-Royal Society, Or that all Questions and Cases of Experimental Philosophy be admitted; If it should be so, I think this some-what Touches upon the Prerogative of the Crown, and may be called in Question, under the head of High Misdemeanours, if not <HI>Pro Crimine lesae Majestatis</HI>; but howsoever, tho' there be no distinction made, yet we will take it in a more Charitable sense, &amp; that the Proposal (in Intent) is wholly con∣fined to Church matters; and if so, we must then enquire, How many deep Questions can be found in our Country, grown mouldy with the <HI>Gibeonites</HI> Bread, for want of wise handling?

<HEAD>SECT. III. THat Advice be taken by the Associated Pastors, from time to time, ere they proceed to any Action in their particular Churches, which may be likely to Pro∣duce any Imbroylments.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<PB N="68" REF="001660_0067_0FB4DAE3523A9870"/>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>This is very Dishonourable, and also a very Unreasonable Incroachment upon the Officers and Government of the Churches.</P>
<P>It Divests the Officers of the free Exercise of that Office-Authority, which Gods Word and our <HI>Plat-form</HI> places in them; Read <HI>Platf. Chap.</HI> 10. <HI>Sect.</HI> 8, 9. These are to feed and Rule the Churches, they are to receive the Accusations, and prepare them for the Churches hearing. This Section of the <HI>Plat-form</HI> fixes both Process and Judicature in particular Pastors and Churches, without any Limitation? But the Proposal allows no Process to be Opened, till Letters of Ly∣cence be obtained, from the Classes. But why may not all other Persons in Office be thus Fettered, as well as the Pastors of Churches? are these the only Studients of Wisdom and Righteousness, that are strangers to the nature of Actions, to the Rule, and the application of it? All other Offi∣cers, in Trust and Commission, who are wise and Loyal, execute the hardest Articles in their Im∣ploy; and who may say to them, why do you so? Our Judges never stick to hang a man, so long as their Commission and the Law will bear them out, and they themselves are left, to be Inter∣preters of Both. And that this Proposal is a San∣ctuary for Officers against a storm; alas! the most that we can make of it, is a Covering of Figg-Leaves, and may serve for a Harbour to Cowards and Fools but not for men of spirit and
<PB N="69" REF="001660_0068_0FB4DAE4CECA02C0"/>
Conduct. The Dream of an Imbroylment, can never Counter-Poize Duty; If men are Trusted with Duty, they must consult that, and not Events. If men are plac'd at Helm, to steer in all weather which Blows, they must not be afraid of the Waves, or a wet Coat.</P>
<P>It is certain, it was no Dimunition for <HI>Timothy</HI> to carry St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cloak and Parchments from <HI>Troas,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.13. Yet for Perticular Pastors in the Mannagement of Church-Government to do little more then to carry the Copies and Parchments of Associations about the Country, and hang up their Decrees on the Pillars of Chur∣ches, according to the Order of the Proposal, can never entitle them to such a Tribute of Love and Honour as the Scripture does assign them, as the purchase of their great Merits, 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.5. 1. Thess. 5.12, 13. such Bequestments as these from the fountain of Honour, must signifie more than some such poor low servile Business (no ways too high for <HI>Jereboham's</HI> Priests to execute) as is laid out in the Proposal, but espe∣cially if they have but some one head man to Con∣duct and draw <HI>up the Conclusion.</HI></P>
<P>Sect. <HI>That the Associated Pastors do carefully and lovingly treat each other with that Watchfulness which may be of Ʋniversal advantage.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> Whether Watchfulness is proper, or a Term applicable to Persons so Quallified, so Sacred, and in so <HI>high a function as those who are here intended</HI>?</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="70" REF="001660_0069_0FB4DAE891487040"/>2<HI>dly. Whether</HI> to <HI>Institute Watchmen over Watch∣men, be not the way to Distribute the Clergy</HI> into Inferiour and Superiour Degrees, and so <HI>ad Infinitum &amp;c.</HI> or at least till the Churches of this Country (for you must know this is one Proposal made for their Support) be Supported and well Ordered by Suffragons, Metropolitans, and other great Pillars of those Churches, where Clergy-men in higher Orbes, inspect those in the same Order, who are beneath them in trust and Dignity?</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> But if you Intend honestly, only the Watch of one Brother over another, as is the Duty of all Christian People, one towards an∣other, then <HI>I</HI> cannot understand the sence of the Word, as <HI>Applicable</HI> here, with the least good meaning or Syntax imaginable.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> For tho' there is a Design of New Moddeling of men and bringing Clergy-men into another Form of Society, yet there is no Intent Divulged, that they shall Co-habit, Bed and Board together upon certain Charters, as the Fryars or Benedic∣tines, in their Royal Monastaries. Indeed the Section might have been Ingrost with the first Canons of the <HI>Dominicans</HI> or St. <HI>Bennets Laws,</HI> when first entring upon their Monastick Life, but it no ways agrees with this Constitution.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> For, as for the Occasional meeting of men eminently sober and vertuous, what bu∣siness can be supposed for a Watch, for about the space of 24. or 48. hours, in such Examples? Very bad men will hold out longer then so, in a
<PB N="71" REF="001660_0070_0FB4DAEBD26C2FC0"/>
good behaviour under the awe of but some one venerable Person.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> And when these Eminent Persons, Mem∣bers of the Association, are dispersed to their own proper Precincts, the Proposal surely does not intend they shall follw the Chargeable Exam∣ple of Princes, who usually keep Spies in each others Courts, to inform themselves, how things are managed there; for its plain, the Charge and Expence in mannaging such a Watch as this, will Reduce all Clergy-men to this <HI>Dilemma,</HI> That they must either vote up the Sallary, or vote down the Method. But then the thing it self is not fair; for it would seem as tho' they watched More for the halting then the help of each other. But as for the Proposal, a Riddle I found it, and a Riddle <HI>I leave it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> And that if any Minister be accused to the Association where he belongs, of Scandal or Heresy, the matter shall be there Examined, and if the Associated Ministers find just occasion for it, they shall direct a Calling of the Council, by which such an Offender is to be proceeded against.</P>

<P>I must Boldly and freely enquire, Whether this is an honest Answer to the Question propoun∣ded in the head of the Proposals? or whether in Reality this is the Supporting, Preserving and well Ordering the Interest of the Churches there Meant? If you, mean as you Speak, I am sure there is either some Dishonesty or some Misunder∣standing between the Question and the Answer;
<PB N="72" REF="001660_0071_0FB4DAED4E677C18"/>
for it can't possibly be otherwise, unless the parts of speech are lately become a Chaos, and all words are not only of the doubtful Gender, but such unreasonable Epiceens, that not only both kinds, but both Contraries are signified in them; or thus, that to build, Plant, Repair, Pluck up, pull Down and Demolish, are all now become Convertible Terms; for take away these high Prerogatives from the Churches, and you take away their Being. These and such like Royalties, are their <HI>Formalis Ratio,</HI> or the formal Cause (<HI>per Quam Res est id quod est)</HI> by which they are, what they are; and this will be very evident, if we do but Read a short Lecture on the Churches Essence Anatomiz'd, or let their Essential and Constituent parts and Powers be Viewed in the History, and Philosophy of their own Beings, and we shall quickly discern your Mistake; for that end read <HI>Plat-form. Chap.</HI> 5. <HI>Sect.</HI> 2. Ordinary Church Power, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Privi∣ledge belongs to the Brother-hood,</HI> and may be Acted or exercised immediately by Themselves. And <HI>More Directly</HI> to the Case in hand, Look into <HI>Chap.</HI> 10. <HI>Sect.</HI> 6. where there we read
<Q>If an Elder offend Incorrigibly, the Matter so Requi∣ring, as the Church, had Power to call him to Office, so they have Power, according to Order (the Council of other Churches, where it may be had, directing thereto) to Remove him from his Office; and being now but a Member, in case he add Contumacy to his sin, the Church that had Power to receive him in to their Fel∣lowship,
<PB N="73" REF="001660_0072_0FB4DAFE302F20F8"/>
hath also the same Power to cast him out, that they have concerning any other Members.</Q></P>
<P>Now herein we find an Essential Article in the Government and being of these Churches, <HI>That they have and hold such Jurisdiction over their own Members; That the Highest Tribunal Ecclesia∣stical on Earth, is There; and that their own Delin∣quent private Members, and Publick Officers are Tryable only there, and there they must Receive the Definitive Sentence, and abide the Execution of it.</HI></P>
<P>And if so, then I shall make bold to Revive my Query again, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the Proposal is either Honourable, Civil or honest, thus to Tumble down at one Blow, this <HI>High Seat of Authority</HI>? and to break open our Prison Doors, and Loose the Fetters of our great Offenders? and at the best, to take them out of our hands, and make their Mittimus to Forreign Pastors to do Justice upon them, and yet in the mean time, to Profess, they are doing us no other Injuries but only Repairing and Mending our Churches? Again, Whether this is fair, and work-man-like amongst honest men?</P>
<P>But to make a small Stop here, I must remind you, That this head is not to be passed over Slight∣ly; for this is the <HI>One Thing</HI> in the <HI>Essence of our Churches, It is their Peculiar Infranchizement and Birth-Right,</HI> and we may not sell it with <HI>Esau</HI> at a Cheap Market; If we Do, we undo our selves; for <HI>Indeed</HI> you must know, here lies the <HI>Marring</HI> or <HI>Making of our Churches</HI>; here is laid up their
<PB N="74" REF="001660_0073_0FB4DAFFD5B62E88"/>
strength, and here hangs the Pick-Lock of their <HI>Treasure</HI>; for by this Key stolen or wrinched out of their Hands, the <HI>Churches</HI> of Christ in the <HI>World,</HI> have been <HI>Exposed and Plundred,</HI> for more then a Thousand Years, and many of them have no∣thing at this day left them, comparitively, but a poor, starved, shabbid, Implicit <HI>Faith,</HI> and a dull, saturnal, blunt and blind Obedience, that a man would scarcely give a Groat for both of them. In a word, the Usurpations of the Pastors, since the great Revolt, having unshackled one another, and broke loose from the Restrictions they are justly subjected to, under the Churches Power of Priviledge, has utterly undone the Christian World, from <HI>This Root of Bitterness, and Pride,</HI> from this <HI>Seed</HI> sprung up, the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> as we have it in an <HI>Anomulus Author, viz.</HI> the <HI>Eletherians,</HI> pag. 4. In words to this purpose,
<Q>Then a little Preist had an Opportunity to Establish himself, Then there Appeared in the Temple of God that Antichrist, who calls him∣self the Vicar of Christ.</Q>
And then the same Author going on to discover the Original of this <HI>Monstrous Birth,</HI> he says thus, Antichrist was Conceived in, by, and from certain Affectations of Ecclesiastical Prehemincies. As tho' he should say, the first Spawn or Embryo of that Insolent <HI>Hector,</HI> or Aspiring <HI>Nimord,</HI> (who first Robbed the Laity of their Christian Liberties, and then Hunted down the Potentates of the World, and Brought them as a Rich spoil into his Habitation of Violence) took its Commencement from this
<PB N="75" REF="001660_0074_0FB4DB014BE26390"/>
Principle, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Clergies assuming to themselves this Ecclesiastical Pre-heminence, <HI>viz.</HI> first their obtaining an Exemption from the Cognizance of the Churches, for their Crimes, and then in possessing themselves of the sole and absolute Jurisdiction (by a dispotick Government) over the Churches themselves.</P>
<P>But however things have been hitherto, I shall no longer uphold the Debate, by revi∣sing the Abuses that have been <HI>done</HI> to the Chri∣stian Churches by an Ambitious Clergy, in the Ages past, which might more amply be discove∣red, by tracing the Foot-steps of the great Apo∣stacy; But I shall end the whole Dispute on this head, by drawing up a Protest, and denying the Jurisdiction of the Court, erected and opened by the <HI>Proposals,</HI> as being perfectly Disagreeing and Repugnant to our former Settlements and present Constitution.</P>

<P>Thus it is very Reasonable that the Churches should be well assured of the Sufficiency of the Learning of those Persons, e're they presume on the Ministry; yet there is a fairer way in vew, fuller of Honour and Safety, than what the Proposal Directs to.</P>
<P>Our Accademy is the Store-house of Learning,
<PB N="79" REF="001660_0078_0FB4DB1ACBCF9EE0"/>
and this all Mankind will Assent to. When you have lost the Company of the Muses, there they are found in their Free-holds, where they hold the ballance of Honour amongst the Learned. This is the Place, if not of the Goddess <HI>Minarva</HI> or <HI>Apollo,</HI> yet the <HI>Bethel</HI> or Temple of God him∣self; the God of Wisdom, where he, as cheif Architect, with his under-work-men, form Wise and Learned Men, and where you may have them wrought off at the first hand: Then certainly here we are to secure our Credulity and Confi∣dence in this Affair; here we are to know whether they be or the Right Stamp, <HI>Yea</HI> or <HI>No.</HI></P>
<P>That of all men living, the best and most In∣fallible Standard for the Philosophical Accom∣plishments of our Candidates, is the Judgment of the Honorable President and noble Fellows of our Famous Colledge; for this I am sure must needs stand for a verity, that the Judgment of a real Honest and skilfull Artificer (keeping close to his Shop) concerning the Nature and Qualities of an Edge-Tool which he hath wrought, and hammered on his own Anvil, out of its first Rude Matter, must certainly Excel him that hath been long from the Trade, that only takes it, turns the Edge slightly, or has but a Transient view of it! So that hence we may fairly infer, that (as to humane Learning) <HI>Harvards Commen∣damus</HI> is most valuable and sufficient, and justly Supplants these Testimonials.</P>
<P N="2">2. With respect to the more Evangelial Quali∣fications of the Gospel Ministry, we shall be ready
<PB N="80" REF="001660_0079_0FB4DB1C4C85F2A8"/>
to honour the sufficiency of the Associates, yet must take liberty to Object a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Suppose we, that the Tryal is made <HI>per Con∣cionem ad Clerum,</HI> by Preaching a Sermon in Au∣dience of the Association, and I think this is the way proposed and generally agreed upon, as the Square or Rule most agreeable with <HI>Gunter,</HI> to take the Dimensions, Length and Breath of our <HI>Candidates by.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply</HI> 1. What can a Sermon do at deciding this Question? for that the most sensible and valua∣ble, who are usually most Humble and tender, are lyable by this Stupendious Examination, to be baffled by their own Timerity, and quite dash'd out of countenance by their own fear. Alas! upon their first Entrance upon the Stage, to ap∣pear in so august and awful a Presence, this must needs dis-animate and put their thoughts into a Ruffle, as having in their afrighted minds the Resemblance of their going into the <HI>Spanish Inquisition,</HI> rather then Dwelling amongst the Softer Measures of the Gospel? <HI>Luther</HI> himself, (that unparallell'd Instance of Spirit and Magna∣nimity (as I Remember of his Life) hardly ever got over something of a Panick Fear attending him, through the course of his Ministry; and in∣deed, Men of the quickest senses are most liable to these Paroxisms. Then surely to put our <HI>Tyros</HI> to this Test, which may daunt and dis-spirit the greatest Hero, is no ways Proportionable, especially seeing they may under the Inspection of Learned, honest and Judicious Men, both
<PB N="81" REF="001660_0080_0FB4DB22B6579348"/>
Pastors and Churches, and thereby under Covert of more Private Invitations (with all their natural) creep into this noble Work, and keeping on, as their Courage and Strength will bear the Journey, may, Gradatim, attain a just and sufficient Pro∣bation, as our Learned youth have hitherto done.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Bold and Brazen, who can make a greater figure with half the stock, by many shircking Tricks, and dissembling Artifices, defen∣ded and supported with confidence and Delivery, may obtain the <HI>Euge Juvenis,</HI> that they no ways deserve, as will be found, when they come to be Detected by a more Dilatory Search, or a more tedious <HI>Analisis</HI> made of them. That, to conclude, as the Proverb is, <HI>Ʋna Hirundo non facit Ver</HI>; one Swallow makes not the Spring; so in this Tryal one good or mean Sermon cannot Determine the man or <HI>umpire</HI> his Case.</P>
<P N="2">2. Suppose the Tryal must be made, and the Question Determined by <HI>a Persons Conversa∣tion.</HI> And this is a very great Article in the State of all Serviceable men, and especially in the Ministry, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.12. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3. <HI>being Ensamp∣les to the stock.</HI> Then Certainly a more Intimate Converse and Society, is a very <HI>Invincible Plea.</HI> By the Laws and Costums of England, the Vicinage must be allowed, as affording the Most Competent Judges, when Persons Reputation lies at stake in Criminal Cases, because they are pre∣sumed to know some-what considerable of Per∣sons and Cases of their own knowledge, and so
<PB N="90" REF="001660_0081_0FB4DB2996E9B518"/>
more capable of giving a Just Verdict. So in the Case, what do those Persons know of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lear∣ned Youth, who make up the Association? Our Candidates appear on a Certain day, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blazing Stars once in an Age, and are gazed on▪ and then they vanish) Now what Judgment can be made on a mans Conversation by such a Transcient view? unless they must be handled in this Con∣sistory, as Persons that have been bound to the Peace, and in open Court are to be delivered from their Recognizane by three Out-Cryes?</P>
<P N="3">3. Suppose the whole stock of Ministerial Qualifications must be enquired into, and Judg∣ment must pass by the direction of the Apostolick Law, 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1·6.9. <HI>viz. Let them be Blameless, Sober, apt to Teach,</HI> &amp;c. and add what more you please, which the Scripture mentions, to fill up the Character of an Evengelical Mini∣ster, to compleat him in all his Gifts and Graces, either in his beginnings, or in his Riper State, and it is most apparent, that our particular Pa∣stors and Churches, with the Learning, Expe∣rience, Grace, Wisdom and Discretion they are Owners of, can make a more upright, judici∣ous and sollid Tryal, and give a better account of our Candidates from their frequent Converse with them, and their Occasional and Repeated Preaching amongst them, then the Wisest Asso∣ciation in the World can do, and it is easier Dissem∣bling with the latter, than the former, unless the Association will take them home, and both Win∣ter and Summer them.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="001660_0082_0FB4DB2A90615430"/>Now then, considering that their Degrees, with the express Testimony of the Colledge (when Perticularly desired) are sufficient Testimonials of their Learning, and the Experience of their other good Gifts and Ministerial Qualifications, ob∣tained by Converse, and their Occasional Prea∣ching, has been the chief Test and Tryal for our Candidates; and by these Methods they have been approbated in order to Settlement in Office-Trust; and this has been the Custum of the Country and Churches for near four score Years. Wherefore, to conclude this Argument, <HI>I</HI> make this Proclamation, That if any Person or persons disaffected with our old Settlements and Way in Churth-Conduct, will produce one Example led into the Publick Ministry by this Practice, which has justly offended him, and he will or can evince this to be the blameable Cause, we will then Surrender the Costum to your Mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> I shall now Implead the Proposal on a Just Perjudice or Persumption of Corruption in the Clergy, Tho' we are in Charity for the present, yet in this way proposed, we have no assurance for the future against the Corruptness of such Societies; and let any Sober man observe and he will find abundance of poor Tools under the Mark of the Office, where these Measures, and such like, are in force and form. How oft is it Repeated, That poor Sordid Debauch't Wretch∣es are put into <HI>Holy Orders,</HI> when as they were fitter to be put in to the stocks or sent to <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dwell</HI>

for <HI>Mad-men,</HI> then to be sent with their Testi∣monials to work in Christs Vineyard? How long have the Indies, the Seas, the Provinces, and many other parts of the <HI>Empire</HI> Groaned under this Damnable way of cheating God of his Glory and the World of Salvation?</P>
<P><HI>Simony</HI> we know began almost as early as the Christian Church, and has prevailed amongst Clergy-men to a Prodigy. The Sacred things of Gods House have been a Trade and Merchandize, which has beggared the Churches and filled the Clergy in some Kingdoms with a Sacriligious and Exorbitant Pile of <HI>WEALTH,</HI> and the World with a flood of Debauchees; and this Proposal puts us into the way to open the Shop windows again, and expose the same Wares to Sale upon a little Indulgence in our Country; for who can render a Reason that the same Op∣portunities, the same Temptations, the same Corruptions, the same Nature, and the same Power, would not produce the same effects? or that the same Climate, Seed, Ground, and man∣ner of Culture, should not Yeild the same Grain at Harvest?</P>
<P>And what have we in pledge for our Security, more than the Fallacy and fickleness of Humane Na∣ture, when the Power is delivered out of our hands?</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> You may object, That our Candidates, Thro' their own Ambition, and the Indulgence of perticular Pastors, Thurst themselves into the Work too Young, and this our way will Prescribe due Boundaries to them</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="001660_0084_0FB4DB2EBA3A1508"/><HI>Answer.</HI> 1. In <HI>General,</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> solves a worse Case, than can be found (Pick whilst you are weary for an Example to quadrate with the objection, and render it forcible) amongst all our learned Youth, who have hitherto adven∣tured upon the Ministry, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.18 <HI>What then</HI>! &amp;c. as tho' he should say, What's that to you, <HI>Sir</HI>? if Christ be Preached, all is well. And as to our Case, we may say, Despise not the day of small things, all men must have a beginning, and every Bird which is pretty well fleg'd must begin to fly. And ours are not of the Nest where <HI>Icharus</HI> was hatch't, whose Feathers were only glewed on; but these belong to the Angelick Host, and their Wings grow out from their Es∣sence; therefore you may allow them, with the Lark, now and then to dart heaven-ward, tho' the Shell or down be scarce off from their heads. And so we conclude with our Charitable and Divine Apostle, <HI>What then! If Christ be Preached</HI> whether in <HI>Pretence,</HI> or in <HI>Truth,</HI> either by <HI>Old</HI> or by <HI>Young,</HI> yet therein we do rejoyce, yea, and will rejoyce, &amp;c. to see our own <HI>Nazarites</HI>▪ so forward and well disposed, it shall add to our Joy, and no ways increase our Horrour, unless our Ambition should Surprize us with Fear, that such young starts should out-shine us.</P>
<P N="2">2. In <HI>Perticular,</HI> Where will you six the <HI>Quando,</HI> and settle the Precise Aera, or Period of Time, for their Beginning?</P>
<P N="1">1. There is no College or Statute Law yet Enacted, to decide this Question: Then of ne∣cessity
<PB N="86" REF="001660_0085_0FB4DB32F9306950"/>
you must do homage to long and laudable Custom, as to a Superiour Authority, and honou∣rable Ruler; and where that fixes the Time, you must submit; for Custom, when full of days, and of Noble Examples, becomes the <HI>Common Law</HI> of a Nation; and is as soveraign and Plea∣dable, as the Dictates of a Parliamentary Power, at least, it shelters from Rebukes and Calumny: That for any Gentlemen to Affront, Talk-high, and Frown at the Early Zeal and beginnings of our Candidates, is but too much, in Imitation of the <HI>Great Mogul of India,</HI> who after he hath Dined, orders his Trumpets to be blown, to signifie to the Princes of the Earth, that they have liberty now to go to Dinner; and when he hath finished his Formalities, if they please, they may vail their Royal Bonnets, and thank him for nothing; for where there is no Law, There is no Transgression.</P>
<P N="2">2. Under the Gospel, we have no Precise time, tho' there was under the Law, when to be∣gin and enter into the Ministry, the Gospel knows no Bar from Time, where Persons are other ways meetly qualified. Days and Quali∣fications, are divers things, and the latter are the Essentials of a Minister of Christ. It is not, how Old, but how Capable a Person is, which is the main point to be enquired after here. There∣fore where (in some good measure) there is an honest Life, a Gracious Heart, an Orthodox Head, and a learned Tongue, There is no reason to send such Youths to <HI>Jerico</HI> with <HI>Davids</HI> mes∣sengers,

Tho' their Beards are not yet grown) to wait upon Time and Nature, for such an Ac∣complishment; for certainly those Recited are the Principal in the Argument. It is a story in the History of <HI>Persia,</HI> that when the <HI>Grecians</HI> sent some very young Noble-men upon an Em∣bassage to that Court, the <HI>Persians</HI> Reflected upon the <HI>Grecian</HI> Republick for sending Beard∣less Boyes on so Grave a Message to so mighty a Monarch. To which the young <HI>Grecians</HI> very smartly Answered, <HI>That if state Policy did consist in Beards, then He-Goats would do for Em∣bassadors, as well or better then Men</HI>: I must con∣fess, I am some-what of their mind; and there∣fore I think it is not, How long men have lived, but how Wise they are Grown: GOD hath ordained Praise out of the Mouths of Babes. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> pleads, he was a <HI>Child,</HI> but that cannot null his Commission for the Ministry, <HI>Jer.</HI> 1.6. St. <HI>Paul</HI> guards the Ministry of young <HI>Timothy,</HI> by Heavens Authority, to Defend him from Censure, for Audaciousness. What! for a Child to teach Old Men their Duty! Hold! says St. <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.12. <HI>Let no man despise thy Youth.</HI> What! shall not our great Lord Il∣lustrate his Grace and Power in what Examples he pleases? Has he not formed all the Powers of nature? and does he not furnish them with their Distinct Vertues? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But you may say, <HI>Days are full of Wis∣dom, and Youth of</HI> Ignorance <HI>in the great Affairs of Salvation.</HI></P>

But however, if our Candidates must never begin till they are without Ignorance, or not till they have gained all Points (<HI>ad unquem</HI>) in the vast studies of Divinity, then it may be said of all our Ministers, as Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was wont to say of Bishops, when she visited the Schools (<HI>Study hard Children, study hard, for) Bishops are Old Men.</HI> So of Necessity, all our Ministers must be very Old Men. But I think that is more agreeable with our Necessity and state, both in Nature and Grace, which one of the Ancients was wont to say of himself, <HI>viz. That whilst he studied to Teach other men, he Learn't himself.</HI> That Con∣sidering Theology, as well as Art, is a long study, and Life is very short, why may they not begin young? and also, considering that our Churches are no ways over Cluttered with Candidates, there is no need to serve them as Christ did the Money Changers, who with a Whip of small Cords, he drove them out of the Temple; and especially they having hitherto acquitted them∣selves in the main as men that need not be asha∣med, and yet never any one of them, to this day, has been Represented as Learned or ver∣tuous, or any way supported by these Testi∣monials.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. THat they together be Consulted by Berea∣ved Churches, to Recommend to them such Persons as may be fit to be imployed a∣mongst them, for present supply, from whom they may in due time proceed to choose a Pastor.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>According to my Apprehension, this Proposal Insults very Daringly over the Churches in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. By Ingrosing the Right of Jurisdiction, not only over the visible Freedom and Liberties, but Conjugal and Secret Powers of Christs Virgin and Widdow Churches. That it seems to me very Adviseable (if this Proposal may stand for a sound Precept) that forth-with another Office be erected, and put into the hands and under the Government of a few men, exactly skilled in <HI>Phisi∣ognomy,</HI> and deeply studied in the Sympathies and Antipathies of Humane Nature, with an absolute superintending Power to Controul and direct all Wooers in their Choice for the Mar∣riage Bed; for that there is many a fond Lover who has betrayed the glory of Wedlock, by making an unwise and unfortunate Choice; And why may not perticular Beds be over-Ruled,
<PB N="90" REF="001660_0089_0FB4DB3C0741A2B0"/>
as well as perticular Churches? both being for the good and service of Mankind, and for that both parties, Husband and Wife, Pastor and Church, by our sort of Government, are bound for Term of Life, or so long as both shall live. Indeed, were our Constitution in Church-Order under the Superintendency of a Patron, or a Lord Bishop, who can send (<HI>pro Tempore</HI>) a Curate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then Recall him, and place another in his stead, the Project might be very Adviseable; but seeing these Churches are settled Congregational, and by their Princi∣ples, the Ordination is, as it were, the Nuptials, or Marriage Day of two Lovers, that nothing but Death, or a Bill of Divorce (for betraying the Glory of their Union) can Part: It is then good and reasonable, that they be left to choose as they best affect, and not forcibly be tyed up to a kind of Hobsons Choice, <HI>One of these, or None.</HI> This apparently puts too hard upon the Churches Liberties, and overthrows the Govern∣ment; for that our Platform in <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. treating of the Nature of the Churches, asserts, <HI>Sect.</HI> 5. <HI>That the State of the Visible Church since the Coming of Christ, is Only Congregational</HI>; Therefore neither National, Provincial nor Classical; Then what does this Proposal do here?</P>
<P>Also, our Plat-form asserts the free electing Power of the Churches, <HI>Chap.</HI> 5. in these words, Ordinary Church Power is that of Priviledge, such as belongs to the Brother-hood whereby they design persons unto Office. So also in <HI>Chap.</HI> 10.
<PB N="91" REF="001660_0090_0FB4DB45479E8FC0"/>
in these words, The Power granted by Christ unto the Body of the Church and Brother-hood is a Prerogative or Priviledge which the Church doth exercise in the Admission of her own Mem∣bers, and in chusing their own, Officers. Now if Christ has given these high Powers and Autho∣rities to his Churches, he has certainly furnished them with Skill and Wisdom to Manage them.</P>
<P>So we come to the Second Part of the Affront in this Proposal, and that is,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> By its making a plain Presumption of Incapacity in the Churches of Doing their own proper work without their Graces help. It is as much as to say, Alas! Alas! it is well known that the Churches are generally a sort of plain men, little Skilled in deep Matters; That there is apparent Danger, if left in their Elections to their own Conduct of Introducing very Illiterate Persons and doleful Creatures, to preach in the Temple of God, as Officers there. Now this is much agreeing with the old Arguments, against the Laity, who were de∣scribed by the Learned to be without the Know∣ledge of the Original Languages, and other parts of Polite Learning, and so no ways fit to Interpret Scripture, therefore it is very Rationally En∣acted, That the BIBLE be taken from them, lest they should study Heresie and not Holiness out of that Divine Book. But to pass by all such Pleas, I shall come to the main point in plain Terms, and that is this, Our <HI>Plat-Form</HI> is our Settlement, and it has Secured to the
<PB N="92" REF="001660_0091_0FB4DB48551EB918"/>
Churches these Prerogatives, and they are part of their Intailed Inheritance; &amp; it is a vain thing to pretend or plead the Incapacity of Right Owners and Rich Proprietors, especially whilst there is a Competent Set of Sences left them. Indeed, when any Gentlemen can shew any Pre∣cept, and produce a Commission for the taking into their hands the Estate of Ideot-Churches, they may then Cite their Intellectuals to a pro∣per Bar, and Verdict going against any parti∣cular Example, they than, <HI>Ipso facto,</HI> become Gaurdians, and may enter into their Worship. But in the mean time, as to our own Churches, and the whole Constellation of them, and every Individual or particular Church amongst them remains <HI>Compos mentis,</HI> and therefore must not be intreagued by such Officers as these are.</P>
<P>But yet before I close this Argument, I shall a little further humour the Presumption of Insufficiency here laid down; and therefore I shall desire, that a Survey be made of the state of the Churches, and if their free Election be found for this thirty Years last past (and we will go no higher) have by the Major part of Voices introduced Insufficient Officers, Then let the <HI>Plat-Form</HI> be null'd, and the Proposal stand as a more vallid Cannon. And in this Inquiry we would know, whether the Dictators will give leave (in drawing up the Catalogue of defective electi∣ons) that they themselves be put on the back of the Title Page, and there stand as the <HI>Errata</HI> of our Old Government? or whether they them∣selves are the only exceptions?</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="001660_0092_0FB4DB495573B300"/>But suppose we, when we have accomplished our search, we find their own, and all other Elections, for the main, have hit Right; and if so, then whether we ought not to pay a Vene∣ration to the Practice, as having more of Christ in it than we can in the Rufflings of Ambition presently find out, or perceive? And whether after such long Experience and good Success it may'nt be our Wisdom to keep this <HI>via Trita,</HI> which we have found to be <HI>via Tuta,</HI> That is to say, keep the good old Way of our Blessed Pre∣decessors, lest going into a new and untrodden Path, we fall into some <HI>Ambuscado,</HI> and come off whith broken Bones and Ruin'd Churches?</P>

<P>Indeed, when great men turn Beggars for small Booties, with the famous General <HI>Ba∣ziliareous,</HI> it signifies, the Ebb of Fortune runs low with them; But when they ask an Ancient Inheritance upon Gift, it signifies either the Donor to be in a Languishing Posture, and that his Estate is like to Escheat to the Crown, through failure of natural <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or else great boldness in the beggars. But what should be the Meaning of this Demand, who can Divine? I hope they dont reckon the Churches to be making their last Will, and design them for their Heirs.</P>

Councils necessary for their own well beeing, they are also as likely to continue as they were forty Years ago, unless their own Pastors should betray them. And they are also as capable of managing all Instruments de∣volved upon them by Christ, as they were in the days of their Youth. Then what can we make of this Contrivement, <HI>viz.</HI> when the Churches shall have Occasion to seek Relief by Council (as sometimes the Emperour has been Confined at the Insolent Threshold of his Ho∣liness, and upon his coming forth in his Infalli∣bility, this Pile of Temporal Glory has been his Horse-blok; and so here) they must humbly wait at the Door of the Association, till they shall be Informed When, What, Who, and Where they shall have one.

<P>This is a great a <HI>Thesis</HI>; and who-ever was the Father, the Womb of it is very fertile and bigg with Articles of Moment, it Comprehends a large Territory, and a great Treasure; we must therefore Survey it by Cosmography, and then nextly by the Laws of the Church Stock.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Country contained in this Proposal, by a just Consequence, and from the nature of the Design, must extend so far as we can find any Gospel Churches Planted, or to be Planted with∣in the English Dominion on the firm Land or Continent of <HI>America,</HI> there is no Restriction made to Exclude any; and Charity is a grace that would have every one Vertuous, and equal∣ly Priviledged with means for that End; so that we may begin our Lines of Latitude in the South, some-what North-ward of the Capes

of <HI>Florida,</HI> and then Extend them to the North, to some parts of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> if not to the Bay of <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> and from those points on to the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> we must stretch our Lines over-Thawrt, keeping equal Longitudes, till we meet with other Princes Dominions▪ Now this is a noble Territory, enough for an Empire, and all <HI>English</HI>; and why may we not be thus Extensive for the good of the Churches there∣in Planted? Other Countries have sent their Delegates near as far as this comes to, to wait upon the Conventions of his Holiness. But, the Mischeif is, The Revenue won't hold out. But I have Thought of one way, and that will do, if we can but obtain, tho' I acknowledge it is some-what Chimerical, or Whimsical; Yet, tho' it be, the Proposal has no reason to repine or find fault, for that it is Its near Kins-Man.</P>
<P>The Project is this, <HI>viz.</HI> Upon the great Set∣tlements which we hope for, between the two Crowns, I advise that Petitions be made (if the Articles of Settlement will allow of it) That either the Rents of <HI>Toledo,</HI> or some good stout Gold Mine in <HI>Peru,</HI> be reserved wholly to the use of this Design, and if you are plea∣sed to keep or settle within narrower Limits (when we know your Territory) we can by Rules of Proportion and Substraction, compute the Charge, and if there be any Over-Plus, when your own Charges are Defray'd, the rest may be assigned to the next Province for

such Good Uses. But however, let the Petitions go for-ward; for you will have want enough of your Share; for I am sure, your present Supplyes are not full enough for your <HI>Daily Bread</HI> and these Contingent and unexpected Charges, especially seeing they were never thought of, or Provided for, in your first Settle∣ments.</P>

<P>This Proposal seems to be founded upon the <HI>Epecurian</HI> Doctrine of Atoms; for by the Sche∣me which <HI>Atheistical Atomists</HI> give concerning the Beginning of the World, by their Account, it was after this lucky manner, that is to say, There was before time, a vast Pile of Incohe∣rent
<PB N="101" REF="001660_0100_0FB4D7DD4CFABD18"/>
Atomes, which Globically hung Sleeping upon a Centre-Atom, without the least Grain of sence, thro' the vast Eternity, a <HI>Perte Ante</HI>; But at last, and no body can tell how, they were inclined to throw off their present Posture; but being neither of one Form, Inclination nor Pro∣pension, quickly great heaving and shuffing (from various Sympathies and Antipathies) began to be amongst them, that a Chaos is pre∣sently Rolled together, and in a little time this Magnificent and curious World, which you look upon, came out of the horrid Womb of this distracted heap of <HI>Atoms,</HI> and that without any help from a Creating Power, but only by a wonderful good Chance. Thus far you have the <HI>Doctrine of Atoms,</HI> which I could not well avoid, because of so much Noble Matter Pre-existing, and represented in various Shapes and Forms, with a sound of Motion and various Sympathies and Antipathies appearing, and represented by the Proposal; but yet, can hear of no Superintending <HI>Fiat,</HI> or any <HI>Creating Voice</HI> to Over-rule, or say, <HI>Let it Be.</HI> But only if Persons are Disposed, or Indisposed, the Busi∣ness must be managed as Wisely as you Can; and if it should so Chance, that some fine thing, (never before seen in the Country) should be made out of these Materials, without the help of a Creating Power, the World would be a great Debtor to the Accident, and the Chur∣ches may they not be Justly stript of their being, to make Room for it, and maintain it?</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="001660_0101_0FB4D7D806561DB8"/>But to be more Distinct, and some-what more close in my Answer, I must remind you, That our Blessed Lord Commands us to Pray, <HI>Math.</HI> 6▪ <HI>Our Father which art in Heaven,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Lead us not into Temptation, But Deliver us from Evil.</HI> And if sincere, <HI>he hath Promised, To stablish us and keep us from Evil.</HI> 2. <HI>Thess.</HI> 3.3. From these Di∣vine Principles, the Question is, Whether those Pastors are the stable or <HI>Ʋnstable,</HI> the Reason∣able, or <HI>Ʋnreasonable-Men, viz.</HI> Either those who <HI>have Promoted this Design</HI> in the Country, or those who have withstood it? And also where has Temptation Prevailed <HI>MOST</HI>? And to put this Debate under a brighter Light, I will make bold to recite a brief History of this matter, till we bring you to the <HI>Nativity</HI> of these Propo∣sals, and to the day wherein they were Born, with some Present <HI>Improvement of the History.</HI></P>
<P>About Thirty years ago, more or less, there was no Appearance of the Associations of Pastors in these Colonies, and in some Parts and Places, there is none Yet. But after the Country had suffered much in the slaughters and depredations committed by the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and by many other Afflictions, the Neighbouring Ministers, in some Counties, met to Pray together, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for no other Intent, that I ever knew or heard of. But after they had continued their Meetings for some years, and others following the Exam∣ple, began to Converse together and communi∣cate Cases, as best suited Each Person, and at last perceiving they were almost gotten in to
<PB N="103" REF="001660_0102_0FB4D7D9851F2458"/>
a Classical Form, before they thought of it, They began to give their Meetings the Specious Titles of <HI>Classes Associations,</HI> And <HI>Ecclesiastical Conventions, &amp;c.</HI> as Securely as tho' these Titles were a Fruit naturally growing out of our own Constitution; and by Degrees <HI>began to</HI> dream that they were Really, and <HI>De Jure,</HI> what their new Titles and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Custom had made them only <HI>de Facto,</HI> and Time increased their Inclinations and Purposes to Compass a more for∣mal and compleat Settlement. It is certain their Opportunities were Considerable, the Keys of <HI>the Church Treasures being put into their hands.</HI> And the more the main Point is studied, the more glory appears to feed mens Ambition, like the impression by the Eye, on our great Parents in Paradice <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.8. The Tree was Pleasant to the Eyes, a Tree to be desired. Alas! Alas! <HI>Empire and supream Rule is a glo∣rious thing! Par core subjectis &amp; debellare Super∣bas,</HI> is a very Royal business. Now this <HI>Conceit did begin Prety much to Predominate,</HI> especially in some Gentlemen that were inclined to <HI>Presby∣terian Principles,</HI> Men of Worth and Learning, who improving their Advantages of sence and Influence, to Intreague others of a lower set of Intellectuals, &amp;c. brought the business so near to a Conclusion, as you find it in the last recited Proposal, wherein you have the main of this History contained, like <HI>Homers Illiads</HI> in a Nut shell. But to make short, and Conclude my Story, when they had thus far advanc'd and

Ripen'd their design, out comes these Proposals like <HI>Aarons Golden Calf,</HI> the 5th day of <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1705.</P>
<P>Thus you have a short Account how things have been carried on, Relating to Associations; and having a <HI>convenient Crisis,</HI> I shall improve the History, to Promote my Present Design in a few perticulars.</P>

dealt with that (<HI>Exod.</HI> 32.20) when he took it and burnt it in the Fire, and ground it to Powder, for that it is very Evident, That tho' it be <HI>But a Calf now,</HI> yet in time it may grow (being of a Thristy Nature) to <HI>become a sturdy Ox that will know no Whoa,</HI> and it may be past the Churches skill then to subdue it.</P>
<P>For if I am not much mistaken (and Pareus too) <HI>That great and Terrible Beast with Seven heads and ten Hornes, Discribed in the Revelations</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>was nothing else a few Ages ago but just such another Calf as this is.</HI> It was indeed finely Shap'd and of Neat Limbs, when it was first Calved, insomuch that the Great Potentates of the Earth, were much Ravished with its Aspect and Features: some offered to Suckle it on the choicest Cows amongst all the Herds of Royal Cattle (that it might be large) ho∣ping to stock their own Countries with the Breed, and when it was grown to a Consider∣able Magnitude, to Render it more shapely and fair, they put Iron Tips on to its Horns and beset its Stupendious Bulk with very Rich Ornaments, that they might make it the more Aweing to All Beholders, And (if possible) by such Artifices to Add to the Natural Pride and Choller of the Creature.</P>
<P>But alas, Poor men! They have paid dear for their Prodigality and Fondness; for this very Creature, that was but a Calf when they first begun to feed it, is now grown to be such a mad Furious and Wild Bull, that there is scarce a

Christian Monarch on Earth, unless the great <HI>ANNE,</HI> their <HI>Swedish</HI> and <HI>Prusian</HI> Majesties, and their <HI>High Mightinesses,</HI> with this Exception) there is scarce a Potentate in the World, the Best Horse-man or Hunts-man of them all, that dare take this Beast by the Horns, when he begins to Bounce and Bellow. Indeed the Emperour within these few Years, has Recovered so much Courage that he took him by the Tayl, to drive him out of Royal Granges, being quite Angry and weary with his Cropping and Brouzingon the Flowers of his Imperial Crown. But otherways the Beast generally goes at large, and does what he will in all Princes Dominions, and keps them in awe. Therefore to conclude, and Infer, <HI>Obsta Principiis</HI>! It is Wisdom to nip such Growths in the Bud, and keep down by early Slaughter such a breed of Cattle. <HI>Nam omne Malum nascens facile opprimitur.</HI></P>

<P>Seeing it is the first Time we have in these Pro∣posals heard of a Standing Council for these Churches, and tho' the Whole Doctrine of it is not precisely or in Terms contained in this Section, yet that they may pass over what remains more briefly, when <HI>I</HI> come upon each following Section, <HI>I</HI> will therefore make a stop here, and discourse this Subject in its seveal Distinct Bran∣ches, and make but one work of it; and <HI>I</HI> shall thus Methodize the Business.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>I</HI> shall observe the seeming Favour to the Lay-Delegates here offered to them in this <HI>Proposal.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Survey the nature of the Council.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Inquire into its Original.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Take an account of the Work which is as∣signed it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. View the Time appointed, certain &amp; uncertain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Inquire for the Place where it is to meet.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. And Lastly, discourse its Maintenance.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. We must observe the seeming Favour the Lay-Delegates or Fraternity of the Churches are Treated with in this Proposal; for at the first Tender they seem very Honourably to be invited into the Association, as tho' they were to be esta∣blished Members of this Council, were to be equal sharers in the Authority and Government in it; yet do but mind the Connection of both Parts of the Proposition, and <HI>you will find there is nothing of this nature Intended for them.</HI> But only a Spe∣cious shew, they are invited to establish the
<PB N="109" REF="001660_0108_0FB4D7E7C506CDE0"/>
Associations on their Tottering Basis, and that is soon done, if all parties are agreed, and from the Fraternity, there is no need of any more forma∣lities, than paying Homage to their Authority by this Act of Submission and Obedience here Proposed; and so soon as this is done, you shall find the Fraternity very fairly Released at the door of the Sessions, every man Repairing to his own home. It is an observation, on the Monarchy of Bees, that the Drones formerly supposed to be not only a lumpish, but a useless Bee, yet is of that nature, and so Essential a Member of that Common Wealth, that it is Really the Male-Bee, and does Imprignate the Females, who are the Sole Labourers in that Kingdom, but when that Crisis is over, the poor Drones are by common Consent Banished, as a great Incumberment; so in our Case, Alas! what can be expected, when the Laye-Delegatees have done the former Job, but that they shall be laid by, for their Wisdom and Capacity is no ways Admired in these Proposals. And it has always been found that the Laity are a Clog to Clergy-men, when they begin to soar a-loft, or above their proper Sphere; and if you will but view the Proposal again, in the hindermost part of it, you will see a Back-door very Artificially finished and left upon Latch, for their Exclusion; for tho' they are called to be Members of the Council in the first part of the Proposal, yet by Exception made in the last part, they are to sit upon no Case but what the Associates please; and seeing
<PB N="110" REF="001660_0109_0FB4D8A94AB6CC40"/>
it is at their dispose, you may Rationally and forcibly conclude, That those who have made it their business to unpin the whole Tabernacle, and have but this Chair to Do, and then all is their own, will now finish their Work with a wet Finger, upon the foresaid Complyance. For you must Note, that after they have Admitted the Brethren, and viewed the Certificates of Election from the several Churches, containing some Congratulatory Complements, to Honour the new Constitution and Government, (as is usual in all States) and having also treated the Delegates with the Civilities of the House, and also with a long and tedious Harangue of the Mighty Blessings these new Settlements plainly Predict and Promise the Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the De∣legates are then advised, <HI>There is no Case at Present Depending fit for their Cognizance, but what is upon file; The Associates have already Considered about it, and Referred to some other Council best known to their Graces. And so,</HI> good Brethren, <HI>you are now with many Thanks for your obedient Attendance, Released till</HI> Latter Lammas, <HI>or till the</HI> Greek Calends <HI>come about.</HI></P>
<P>And here we may dig a Grave to bury all our Antient Priviledges in, and Hang our Harps upon the Willows, and when we are thus wa∣sted, should you call us in once more to sing one of the Songs of <HI>Sion,</HI> all our Notes must be <HI>Elegie &amp; De tristibus,</HI> yet the Broken Accents, and lowly Murmours of our Sorrow will <HI>serve</HI> for <HI>Elahs</HI> and Sweet <HI>Diapasans,</HI> in the Conquer∣ours Song of Triumph.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="111" REF="001660_0110_0FB4D8ABAB9593D8"/>2. We must, <HI>Nextly,</HI> survey the Nature of the Council, which cannot be sooner, and with better Advantage (to Represent the true Idea of it to every mans understanding) than in a breif Definition, Thus, <HI>The Council is to be standing and stated, To meet once in the year at the least, and at other times as each Association shall please to Determine, To Inquire into the Condition of the Churches, and Advise such things as may be for the Advantage of our holy Religion.</HI> Thus you have the nature of it laid out in Terms very Concisely.</P>
<P>But if a longer Description, according to the Genuine sence of Expressions in the Proposals, will better suit you, and give a better impres∣sion of its Nature upon your thoughts, we may then Describe it Thus,</P>
<P>It is a Council of Humane Invention, stated and Settled to Convene once in the Year, Yearly, during the Revolution of the Heavenly Bodies, and at other certain Times of the year, so as to keep its Course Parallel with our High and Superiour Sessions of the Peace, if the Creators please to Consult, Advise and Determine all Affairs within the reach of Ec∣clesiastical Councils, and Especially, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And thus, we being a People swiming in such Plenty, that all our Chargeable Measures, both Domestick in our Private Families, and Publick in Church and Common Wealth, being not near sufficient, to take off our Waste, and Superfluous Streams, and our Riches and stores
<PB N="112" REF="001660_0111_0FB4D8AD0946B1E0"/>
so plainly over-loading us, we have here for∣med a Creature, that will help to sup up all, and feeding upon our full Baskets, we shall find, that the further we go with <HI>Esop's Load,</HI> the lighter we shall grow; Then who will not Admire <HI>the Wisdom</HI> of the Invention!</P>
<P N="3">3. Our next Task is to Examine the Original of this Council, which Inquiry may be resol∣ved into this Disjunct Proposition, <HI>viz. This Coun∣cil is the Result of the Will, Obeying the Ʋnderstanding in its last Dictates, Erring or not Erring.</HI></P>
<P>The Question being thus stated, it is at every mans Liberty, to take the part in the Disjunction which best likes him. <HI>I</HI> suppose the Proposal Arrested and brought to Tryal, will plead, <HI>Not Erring,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> as is usual with all Criminals, when Indicted; and therefore seeing you expect to be Cleared by the Jury, you must give us an honest account, <HI>Who set you on Work, and what Rule you were guided by to Assure us that your Intel∣lectual Powers were free from Error in forming this Council,</HI> and we will give you Room enough in your own Defence. For,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> If you can produce Evidence from the Cannon of Scripture, in express Terms, or by sound Consequence, and prove <HI>New-England Churches</HI> are obliged to form a standing and stated Council, or that you are to do it for them, &amp;c. we will submit. But no such Cannon can be found. The <HI>Proposals</HI> then Incur a heavy Premunire for making <HI>so Bold with a Settled Government,</HI> and no Text to warrant the At∣tempt.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="113" REF="001660_0112_0FB4D8AE8584F6C0"/>2. Is it by any Authority, derived from the Civil Government of the Country by <HI>Law,</HI> or Practice, that this Council is here Erected?</P>
<P N="1">1. By <HI>Law,</HI> If there be any such Law, you have Liberty to Plead it in your own Defence.</P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>Practice,</HI> Has the Civil Government ever set such an Example? Have they ever Intrencht upon the Priviledges of the Churches in the least Degree? And in their own Orb, are they not more Exemplary? Don't all men keep to Commission? Are they not Curious in main∣taining all Settled Forms, as the Limits and Boundaries of all mens Actions and Interests? Nay, is not the <HI>Exalted Head</HI> of this Body Politick in his whole Ministry, Careful to Steer all his Actions by his Commission, and the Pre∣cept of Law? Is not the least Error (tho' made by Jealousy, and not found in Reality) that looks but like an Arbitrary Action presently drawn into complaint, as a great Greivance, and Common Neusance? If it be but in Dream, that the Exchequer appears Toucht, without a precept, or the Wings of our Civil Liberties Clipt, or so much as a Feather be pluckt from them, is not the Country here and the Court at home filled with Complaints? what means all this? And yet must these Churches, formed by Principles of Piety and Honour, and under the Steerage of a wise and just Government, bear whole Cart Loads of Injuries, and have all their Liberties Violated? And at last have a Stated <HI>Antichristian Arbitrary Council,</HI> that can cut their

Throats for all the wise Regulation, that is in it, be thrust in upon them? and both Scripture and the Wise Fathers of the Common Wealth, no Patrons to it? and what must we Swallow all this? This must needs be a very heavy meal to Digest!</P>
<Q><L>Ʋt opes et Lamentabile Regnum— Ereverint?</L>
<L>They spoil our Kingdom, and our Courage Dash,</L>
<L>They take our Wealth, and leave us nought but Trash.</L></Q>
<P N="3">3. Is there any Certificate, Orders, or Vote, from the Churches, as the Womb of this Council? If there be, the Proposals shall then Pass for the Innocent Midwife, and no harme shall come. But, alas! if we search all Church Records, the Pursuit is Blankt! <HI>Therefore it must stand for a Daring Intrusion</HI> upon the Churches Power of Priviledge.</P>
<P>It is and will be acknowledged, with great Justice and Satisfaction, that the Pastors of the Churches are in a high station, as they Re∣present the great Shepherd, and their Trust is Noble and Great; <HI>They are Rulers, and to Conduct all Transactions,</HI> &amp;c <HI>But yet must never Infringe the Churches Power of Priviledge in any Branch of it</HI>? It becomes the Holiness, Wisdom and Honour of the Ruling Officers at a Crisis, when the Churches are in exercise of this Power, not to allow themselves to dictate <HI>Too Imperiou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI>: They must never, indeed, in all their Ministration, talk with such an Elevated Language, as in the 3<HI>d Section of the</HI> 2<HI>d Part,</HI> in these Words, <HI>viz.

As tho' the high Commission Court was Returned from Exile, and now opened, and some of your Graces were to be the Lord Chancellor, <HI>This Plainly carrieth too high a Crest.</HI> What! to consider your selves as a Distinct Estate from the Churches, and to send out of your <HI>Higher House</HI> your Orders to be Obey'd in the <HI>Lower House,</HI> &amp;c? But, I say, this is not Right, for <HI>in Convening and calling of Councils, the Churches are your Superiours</HI>; and upon a severe Interpretation of their Canons, They may, if they please, leave you at home.

<P>Can you shew any Patent from the Empe∣rial Chamber of our Mighty Monarch, to take into your hands (that you may new Model) these Churches (the Royal Demesnes of Christ Jesus the Prince of Peace) as an Escheat to the Crown?

<P><HI>They have out-Pope't the Pope himself,</HI> who is head of an Hierarchy supported by certain Laws, Acts and Ordinances for the maintaining an Harmony or Union between Head and Members. So in the next Place,</P>
<P N="4">4. We came to Survey the Work cut out for this Council.</P>
<P><HI>Cato,</HI> that Great and grave Philosopher did Commonly Demand (when any new Project was propounded unto him) <HI>Cui Bono</HI>? or what good was like to ensue? Now in this present Business, the definition Pretends to make a Satisfactory Answer to such a Question, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Imployment of this Annual Coun∣cil, and that is to enquire into the Condition of the Churches, and advise such things as may be for the advantage of our holy Reli∣gion.</P>
<P>It is certain, considering the Nature of the Creature here formed, there had need be some <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour Assigned. Those who are Purveyours, and must provide Quarters, will find it very Chargeable, That it had need do very Extraordinary Business. As once King <HI>James</HI> the 1st▪ said to a big-Limb'd Country Fellow, who came to Court to be a Porter; some that knew him, told the King how many Bowls fall, and Quarters of Mutton he would
<PB N="124" REF="001660_0123_0FB4D8C1466B5368"/>
eat at a Meal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Says the King to the Fel∣low, You Sirrah, that Eat so much more than other men, If you cannot do so much more Work proportionably than other men, by my So'l (Says the King) I'll hang ye. So here, there had need go a handsome Stock of small Cattle, and other Expences to Maintain one Sessions; That if it has Confidence to meet, and is Treated with an Ordinary allowance, If it can't do abundance of Work, it will be waste Charges, and great Incumberment.</P>
<P>Now, if this be all that is here Proposed (in my Opinion) the Creators are very Defective in their Propositions; For tho' the Work Mention∣ed is in it self good Work, <HI>But it's all Done al∣ready to their hands, There is nothing of this Na∣ture Neglected in</HI> N. England Churches, at the least, no Means or Methods wanted, but as God says, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.4. What <HI>could have been done more for my Vineyard, that I have not Done in it</HI>: may Properly be applyed to the Churches here, and all for the Advantage and Good of our Holy Re∣ligion; that, in a word, <HI>there is no want in this Country,</HI> unless it be the want of good and honest Hearts; and I suppose you have none of those to Bequeath.</P>
<P>Upon the first view of this stupendious Busi∣ness, I was ready to phancy, whether or no you had Dream'd of or seen King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth a coming with his old Case and Question which involved the Pope, his Conclave and all the Accademies in <HI>Europe,</HI> and whether you were
<PB N="125" REF="001660_0124_0FB4D8C2C6ED8F40"/>
getting a Mighty Casuist ready to take the Kings Conscience into Consideration? Or whether you had news of the Old <HI>Arian</HI> War, its Breaking out again, that you should in such haste, (without Citing other Estates for the Defence of the King∣dom, but only by vertue of your Prerogative) Run up such a formidable and Costly Redoubt? But if it be all come to this, and there is no more to do, then what every Pious and Wise Man does every day, every Week, and every Sessions, it is even another fit or Paroxism of the Mountains bringing forth, as the Poet says, <HI>Parturiunt Montes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But to Humour what would seem Serious in the Proposal, I shall consider both parts of the Work Distinctly.</P>
<P>The first is, <HI>To Inquire into the Condition of the Churches.</HI></P>

<PB N="126" REF="001660_0125_0FB4D8C507F8C198"/>
Town, and whether there be any Surgeons, Physitians, or School-Masters that do good to their Neighbours with out Lycence? Or whe∣ther there be any new <HI>Golgotha's</HI> to be Dedi∣cated, for the securer Retreat of the Dead to that Place? Or whether the Parish Curates Read Service well, and observe to time their Particular Lessons, with the Canonical Days? and especially whether the Bells are kept in good Tune and Order, <HI>&amp;c</HI>? All which makes up a Noble piece of Service, to Requite a Crown or Kingdom for the Revenues of a Barony! and, Whether it may be thought, that our Great and yearly Council, will come a whit behind the aforesaid Ministry in the first or last part of ser∣vice Mentioned? And whether if they do but equal them, we may not be thought to have made a wise Settlement? But notwithstanding we shall grant, the Proposal makes mention of a <HI>Christian Duty,</HI> for that it becomes all men, who bear a love to Christ, to enquire into the state of his Churches, both for their Manifesting their love to men, and directing their Prayers and Gratitude to GOD.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. As to their outward and Temporal state, we may inform our selves, by virtue of Neighbour∣hood, by Christian Travellers and Publick Letters of Intelligence; and thus we may Rationally, and with very good moral Certainty know the state of the Churches, both in other Countries and our own; and thus good <HI>Nehemiah</HI> informs him∣self

at <HI>Shushan,</HI> how it fared with his Brethren at <HI>Jerusalem, Neh.</HI> 1.2.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to their Moral State (which consists in their Profession, Faith, manner of Worship, Discipline and Conversation) this is discovered particularly, by their Directories, Confessions of Faith, Plat-forms, Rubrick, Liturgies, and other Canonical Systems made Publick for that end, &amp;c. And considering, that whatever of this nature is necessary for the advance of Religion, is well adjusted in this Country, it must needs be but a vain Repetition, or sensles Tautology for a Council to meet yearly or quarterly for this end, <HI>viz.</HI> To Inquire what News, or whether <HI>New-Englands Confession of Faith</HI> is the same this Year, as it was Last? Or whether all the Chur∣ches, their Manner of Worship, is this Sabboth as it was the other? And as to their <HI>Conversation</HI> (which may seem to lie most out of sight) suf∣ficient Provision is made by the Principles of our wise Plat-form (for Upholding the Commu∣nion of Churches) for our Inquiry and Informa∣tion here also. And Thus we come to the other part of this good Work, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

after? And whether all the Churches and the whole Land are not Honour'd and Addrest, from week to week, in such Measures by infallible Truth, if not by Infallible Men? whether or no these Methods don't Divulge the whole Mind of God to each Plantation?</P>
<P>Or, whether these Gentlemen have any secrets of Wisdom, not yet made Known? Or whether they Intend to serve the Churches, as some great Philosophers and Profound Artists in Medicine Serve the World, <HI>viz,</HI> such who carry some great Inestimable <HI>Catholicon</HI> to the Grave with them?</P>
<P>And whether they will be thus hard hearted in Religion, as the other are in Philosophy, unless we will gratifie them with this Piece of Prodigality here Exacted? <HI>I</HI> must Ackowledge I have little Patience towards these things, that under such a specious shew and Pretence such a direful Catastrophy should be Shrowded!

<P>But however, <HI>I</HI> shall endeavour, to Rescue my self from all Impatience, and with Deli∣beration Sum up my Answer, in an appeal to your own Reason concerning those several Created Trusts, which GOD estalished, and Cloathed with his own Authority, every one of which is acted with great Vigour of Success.

<P N="1">1<HI>st. Civil Authority,</HI> in two great Branches▪</P>
<P N="1">1. Legislative Power (that Civil Omnipo∣tence) is doing very great things for Religion, by their Proclamations, and all Paenal Laws enacted for the Crushing of Immorality and Vice, and in all their wise and exact Precepts for the Support of Justice and Piety. They are opening many civil Channels, whereby they are Conveying Judgment, Justice and Righteousness down our Streets, from the great fountain. Nay, this great and Dread Assembly puts Awe upon all Mankind. And the more Daring and Desperate are kept within Compass, from a sence of this most Terrible Seat of Thunder hanging over their Heads, and upon every Affront ready to break in stroaks of Vengeance and Woes upon them, especially if they grow beyond the reach of Common Law.</P>
<P>And in Ordinary Cases,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Executive Power,</HI> or Ministers of the Law, are like a Standing Camp to awe, and a flying Army to beat the Enemy; They have their Spyes and Scouts out in every Quarter to observe his motions, and break his Measures, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Innumerable Numbers of all sorts of Civil Officers; and thus by the Sword of Justice they hunt down Sin, and Impiety in
<PB N="130" REF="001660_0129_0FB4D8CCCD495E00"/>
the Land. They are a Terror to Evil men, and a Praise to them that do Well; for the Civil Authority, by their wise and just Precepts, their personal and Noble Examples and Zealous Administrations, out-do <HI>Plato</HI> himself with all his Moral Reasons; for they can turn a <HI>Sodom</HI> into a <HI>Zion,</HI> and keep <HI>Zion</HI> to be <HI>Zion</HI> Evident by the History and Chronicles of Several Governments of Gods Ancient People. <HI>Nam Regis ad Exemplum Totus Componitur Orbis</HI>▪ for Chief Rulers, by their good or bad measures, can make or mar, kill or cure a nation, in a moral Sence.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The Churches.</HI></P>
<P>View once more, from some lofty Promon∣tory or <HI>Pisgah,</HI> those Goodly Tents and Taber∣nackles of Israel! Listen! is not God with Them, and the Shout of a King amongst them? Are they not as Valleys spread forth, and as Gardens by the Rivers side, which the Lord hath Planted? And yet, notwithstanding, may we, must we under your Conduct, break up their Fences, to give them another sort of Culture? Nay, consider well! are not the Flowers better wed, and the Weeds more kept down, than in most of the Inclo∣sures in the World, belonging to the <HI>Great Husband-man</HI>? And may you not (in Re∣koning up of means) allow us peculiarly to Ascribe to their Government, and other of their measures agreeing with the nature of it in Dressing the Ground? But <HI>I</HI> will not
<PB N="131" REF="001660_0130_0FB4D8D18A34D6B8"/>
enlarge this head; it is obvious enough from their Ministry, from their Faith, <HI>Their Discipline and Conversations.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Nursaries of Learning.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Inferiour Schools, where the Leaven is laid, hid and kneaded in the soft dough; <HI>Et Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. The College (That Artillery Garden from whence we receive our most expert Souldiers of Christ, and whence Christs Troops are supplyed with Cheif Commanders, who lead on to storm the strong holds of the Common Enemy, and secure our great Alley, <HI>Religion</HI>) This is the Seminary of Learning and virtue, and the Success is almost to a Miracle, unless for Humiliation we must Secret the great Grace and Gifts of God which flow from that Fountain, and are Dis¦persed thro' the Land.</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> Were a Council called, of all the Learned heads of the whole Universe, could they dictate better Laws, and advise better Measures for the Acquirement <HI>of LEARNING the INCREASE</HI> of Virtue and good Religion than in that Royal Province?</P>
<P N="4">4. The Families of the Country with their Oeconomies, and family Religion; If we take a Survey of the whole Land, we shall find Religion placed in the Body Politick, as the Soul in the Body natural. <HI>Nam est Tota Anima, in Toto Corpore, et Toto in Qualibet parte</HI>; That is, the whole Soul is in the whole Body, and whole in every Part. That were any other
<PB N="132" REF="001660_0131_0FB4D8D2868812C8"/>
part of the Body Organized besides the head, it would be capable to exercise Reason, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So Religion is placed and exercised in its Prin∣ciples, Vertues and Governments, Through the Families of the Country, so many families so many little Sanctuaries.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> do acknowledge, there is no General Rule, but has its Exceptions; But under this Caution <HI>I</HI> may ventre to affirm, there is no such Spot of Earth in the Earthly Globe (so Belaboured with family Devotion, Reading Gods Word, Catechizing and well Instructing Youth, with neat and vertuous Examples, and Divine Pray∣ers, <HI>non ex Codice, sed ex Corde,</HI> not out of Books, but out of Hearts, the Solemnizing Sabboths, and family Attendance on publick means) as is <HI>New-England.</HI> And if so, then what need have we of this late invention? Therefore to conclude, I shall, for my own part, with the Jealous <HI>Laocoon</HI> enter Caution against taking down the sides of the City, or opening the Walls of our ZION to let in this <HI>Trojan Horse</HI>; and let all <HI>Israel</HI> say, <HI>Amen</HI>! For, Blessed be God, tho' we want to have our hearts Renewed dayly, but as for means, tho' we <HI>have no</HI> glut, we have Plenty enough, and want no new Institutions.</P>

<P>As <HI>Austin</HI> says of time, <HI>Nivo in Tempore, Lo∣quor de Tempore, sed Nescio quid sit Tempus,</HI> I live in Time, I speak of Time, But yet I know not what Time is. So I do Imagin, the Dictators did not well weigh Time by an exact Ballance, in all its Contents, Sence and Meaning, when they Carved out such a large Portion to this Illegal Claimer. Time is justly esteemed Preci∣ous, in relation to Heaven and Grace, and also very valuable with respect to the interest of Nature and this Life. Therefore, care should be had, that it ben't Squandered away waste∣fully. Our natural Lives, Health and Honour, Families and Estates are all very significant and Costly things, and their Dependence is much on the well husbanding of Time, insomuch that in hard and penurios Climates, the Inhabitants had need be very saving of Time for the sup∣port of all these great Interests, and seeing there is so much time already set for Religion.

<HEAD>Aggravation II.</HEAD>
<P>Is taken from the great Affront, real and Ra∣tional, done to Empire.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Real,</HI> In making thus bold, with the Time and Estates of Loyal Subjects.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Rational</HI>; For let us but consider, that about three hundred Men (Gown-Men, and
<PB N="135" REF="001660_0134_0FB4D8DA0C114778"/>
Sword-men) with twice the Number of Atten∣dants, which will make up near a Thousand strong (and all well hors'd and Provided) to be Mustered, no man living on Earth can tell for what, cannot be well resented by Crowned heads, those Admirers of Order: That the Project carried on, may breed Jealousies, in the heart of our Prince, lest that <HI>Ket, Cade, Straw</HI> or <HI>Tyler</HI> have Pitch't upon an Oath of Re∣formation again, with an intent to over-hawl the Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And especially seeing the Crown was never advised of any such thing (as is Proposed) by the Regular Forms of Em∣pire. There is danger of loosing our Time, and the Credit of our Loyalty together, that all things considered, the best way will be, for us to keep well, whilst we are well; and there∣fore let every Man and Society be advised to Improve their Time wisely, keep in their Post, and honestly study to do their own Business, which God, Law and Regular Settlements has Instructed them with, and we may then hope things will go well with us and our holy Reli∣gion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ʋncertain, viz.</HI> When the Creators please, and can agree, for the more particular Time is best left to the Determination of each Asso∣ciation, as the Proposal affirms. And thus we are left very Uncertain, When Where, or whether it will Ever be; so that, I perceive, you have no great Dependance upon it, neither must we: The Wisdom of Civil Government hath
<PB N="136" REF="001660_0135_0FB4D8DB869136A0"/>
another Sort of Conduct. Such things are not left to Discretion, for that would be Indiscre∣tion, and the way to turn the World into a Bedlam, or the Dwelling Place of Mad-men. And in the Example before us, suppose the Arbi∣trators (when the Question for the Time is propounded) should differ, and hotly dispute the matter, and some should Plead, it was best to be in the Winter, and some in the Summer; some argue for the Fall, and some for the Spring, according as every mans Temper leads him; and at last, referring it to a Majority of Voices, should they (for want of an odd man) lock it by an equal Vote, and so, keep it like a Game at Chess, for several years on the Table, and neither side get the Mastery, we may then in our Distresses Hollow whilst our Throats ake, and no help comes; for they have voted them∣selves fast (like two Bucks in their own Hrons) and can't stir for our Relief.</P>
<P N="6">6. We must, according to promise, make some Inquiry, Where this Council is to meet, or for the Place of Meeting?</P>
<P>It is held in opinion that Castles in the Air and Immaterial Substances do not occupy Place; Philosophy assigns them no more then a <HI>Ʋbi,</HI> where many may exist in <HI>Puncto Indi∣visibli,</HI> or on the point of a Needle, and if this Council is (as I Apprehend it) belonging to that Conjugation, or Catalogue of Beings, it will then have this Priviledge <HI>belonging to it, viz</HI>? There will be no house to build, nor house Rent to pay.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="137" REF="001660_0136_0FB4D8DDC5B45B90"/>7. We come now (in the last place) to consider its Maintenance, by three Queries.</P>
<DIV5 N="1" TYPE="query">
<HEAD><HI>1</HI>st. Query.</HEAD>
<P>Whether the Churches in their Expiring, must (as all Criminals do) Pay for their own Execution, and their Estates be Confiscate, and reserved as a Fond, yeilding a certain stipend <HI>per Annum,</HI> to support their Executioners?</P>
</DIV5>

<HEAD><HI>3</HI>d. Query.</HEAD>
<P>Whether it must not be here, as it is in some Civil Cases under the Cognizance of a very peaceable and good natured Justice, that for the healing of a Difference amongst Neighbours advises them to Agree, &amp;c. and so let every man bear his own Charges?</P>
<P>But how it is, or which way they intend to raise a Support for a standing Council, Yearly, and every year, I cannot find out; there is no stipend settled, or Provision made, in the Ca∣nons which give it being.</P>

and Natural; But in this Scheme there is nothing done for the Support of the new born Infant, but, like a Run-away Dam, you leave it to the Mercy of the Heavens. But possibly the Relief is stored up in your Creating Power, so that if the Charitable Churches will but find a Cradle for the first night, and Naturalize it, you will by your Creating Fiat, soon find a Fortune, if all the Tythes in the Province will do it.</P>
<P>Thus, according to Ingagement, we have pas∣sed Through the several heads, relating to the standing Council, and I think by the <HI>Ana∣lysis,</HI> it is sufficiently Resolved into its first <HI>Nothing,</HI> and therefore what remains, I shall be more brief in my <HI>Answer.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Answer.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The Specificating Act, that Impowers any Member for an Ecclesiastical Council, is the Churches Election or Deligation, according to our Government; so that the Members Sent, are Invested with the Power, and represent those who send them; The Officers have no More of this Power devolved upon them, than any member, and therefore can Challenge no more Right (as Elders) in a Major or in a Negative Vote, they any others, as is very apparent in all Representative Bodies; therefore all Acts must be Determined by the Majority of the whole, as in the house of Commons,

tho' made up of Men of very Different Chara∣cters, when in their own Countries, both as to their Trust, Learning, and Wisdom, and other Distinguishing Qualifications, yet the meanest man there has as great a Force and Power in his Vote or Suffrage, as the best man in the House, for that they all equally represent the Nation, one Man as much as another; So in this Case; For that the Churches and Officers were never yet Since <HI>New-England</HI> stood, held or accoun∣ted two distinct Estates, in an Ecclesiastical Council. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Your Challenge plainly Defines your Inten∣tion, that is to Null the Power of Churches, and set up your selves, as the <HI>Subject</HI> or Foun∣tain of a superintending Power. And then, if the Churches may have so much favour as to Represent themselves by their Lay-Deligates, in a Council you shall see meet to call, you must needs allow them to be a distinct House and Estate. And if so, then you must grant them the Priviledge of a Major Vote, as well as your selves, and so nothing can be acted but by their Compliance also. But I must acknowledge, I have no Plenipotentiary Power to settle Ar∣ticles of Agreement, for the Infringing any of the Rights of the Churches, and therefore must draw up my Memorials or Complaints of In∣croachments upon Ancient Lines and Boundaries, and so leave them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Answer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Church of England</HI> has been wont to look upon us as men out ot our Wits, therefore they Term us Phanaticks, or Mad-men, but much more now. What! for men to break from the Government they themselves have Estab∣lished by Consent and Practice, and Arbitrarily to Rally together, And draw up a Direful Sentence (if not in Terms, yet Intent) for the dissolution of a Country full of the best Churches of Christ in the World, and then (as it were) upon the bold sound of a Trumpet, to excite others to Ratify the <HI>Dead Warrant,</HI> in order to Execution! What can this Import or Signify in the thoughts of Consi∣derate Men, but a <HI>Vertigious Brain</HI>? We might have learned better, and more Caution, from that Mother Church of the Nation, if not from Common Reason; For though out
<PB N="146" REF="001660_0145_0FB4D8EF06709710"/>
Soveraign confides in the Loyalty of her <HI>Eng∣lish Clergy,</HI> Yet to maintain the Grandure of Government, and keep in good Repair that Common Fence, which Keeps every man in his station, therefore, According to the Law and Custom of <HI>England,</HI> The <HI>Convocation,</HI> both the <HI>Higher</HI> and <HI>Lower House</HI> of that Learned and August Assembly, neither Debates nor Transacts any Matter whatsoever, But what our Soveraign by Commission Expresly alloweth of, according to her Prerogative; So that certainly to acquit our selves for Wise men you should have done no less (in a matter of such weight and Moment) then have Petitioned the Publick Authority for Commission, before you had <HI>ventured this far.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But possibly some may say, <HI>We have Petitioned</HI> Authority <HI>to Establish our Councils, since we have drawn them up in form.</HI></P>
<P>Answer. This is to be Prepostrous, and agrees with that illegal Way of Hanging men and then Judging them; But however, it seems they turned a Deaf Ear to your demands; and well they might, for they are too wise men to alter the Laws of the Pro∣vince, long Customs and orderly Settlements of the Churches to gratify an Implicit Faith in the stark-naked <HI>Ipse Dixits</HI> of any man; That unless you can Prove a <HI>Mandamus</HI> from the Crown, or a precept from a higher Court, which by its Divine Authority shall awe and direct them, you may alway expect such En∣tertainment

By the Question proposed, the <HI>Comfort, Support</HI> and <HI>Well being of these Churches</HI> was peculiarly pretended, Then why might not they be nextly advised with, for their Approbation or Esteem? for if you Intend it for a new suit, or change of Appar∣rel, or a set of Armour for this Army in Ban∣ners, it must be the only way to try it on, it being now so near finishing; and if it be done Work-man-like, you will have the Credit and they the Comfort of it; but if it prove too Strait-laced, or should they feel themselves as <HI>David</HI> in <HI>Saul's</HI> Coat of Mail, and should shrug at it, and say, <HI>We cannot go in these, We have not proved them</HI>; yet they may throw all by and keep to their own old Suit, which is not yet half worn, and the Worst come to the worst, you may by any Lawful Writ recover your Wages of those who set you on Work to blow at their Forge.</P>

They are strict, in their Govern∣ment Curious, yet Charitable in their Admis∣sions; in the Election of all Officers they are Nice, Cautious, Judicious, and in the main hitherto very Successful.
