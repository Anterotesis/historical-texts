<P>THE story with which the text is connected, is one of the most affecting tales to be found on sacred record. Taken in all its circumstances, it is beyond a parallel. It contains such a number of surprising incidents, and all, at last, so overruled by the providence of God, for the good of the eastern world, that it is not only one of the most <HI>entertaining,</HI> but also the most <HI>instructive</HI> pieces of history. It gives an <HI>illustrious character</HI> to Jehovah, as a being of <HI>such</HI> sublime perfections, that the most unpromising events are, by him, made sub∣servient to his own glory, and the good of his people. It teaches the malignancy of the passions of envy and
<PB N="6" REF="017807_0004_0FA31A36C58698B8"/>
hatred on the one hand, and the <HI>strength</HI> of <HI>natural affection</HI> on the other; and when these are set in <HI>con∣trast,</HI> as in the case of Joseph and his brethren; when the events are <HI>so</HI> unexpected, <HI>so</HI> interesting, and at last terminate <HI>so well,</HI> the story becomes <HI>too</HI> impassioned to be read with stoical <HI>insensibility.</HI> A man of <HI>senti∣ment</HI> and of <HI>piety</HI> can never read it with an <HI>unaffected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eart,</HI> or with eyes <HI>unsuffused</HI> with tears.—<HI>From it</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> farther learn that guilt is fearful and suspicious.— Thus, the brethren of Joseph, are under fearful ap∣prehensions (since their father was dead, who was the centre of union,) left Joseph, now in power, should take deserved vengeance upon <HI>them</HI> who had designed, and <HI>really,</HI> for a time, brought him into most unhap∣py circumstances. From these suspicions they sent messengers to him, informing that it was the dying injunction of their common parent, that they should confess their fault, and ask forgiveness; hoping from the benignity of his disposition, that he would in consequence thereof, restore them to his favor.— They were not mistaken. The injured brother, al∣ways generous, humane and god-like, most heartily forgave them, assigning this particular reason for his conduct, "you thought evil against me, but God meant it for good," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The occurrence to which my text alludes, has a near affinity, in its origin and final issue, to the tragical event, which eight years ago took place in <HI>this</HI> town, destined, by divine providence, to be the stage on which a most <HI>memorable</HI> scene was acted. The instances are not, indeed, in all respects, parallel; and who could expect to find, even in the bible, that copious book, an instance exactly similar to <HI>that</HI> which <HI>then</HI> happened in <HI>this place</HI>; which ushered in the <HI>American</HI> war, and gave rise to this anniversary, which
<PB N="7" REF="017807_0005_0FA31A37859FFCB8"/>
has been <HI>so worthily</HI> conducted and <HI>laudably</HI> con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nued to <HI>this day.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As hostilities first began in the town of <HI>Lexington,</HI> it was thought proper by the worthy and patriotic minister of that place, with the entire approbation and concurrence of his res∣pected hearers, to institute a solemn annual commemoration of that important event; on which the <HI>militia</HI> has been un∣derarms, military exercises performed, and a sermon preached to crouded auditories. The whole has been conducted with great decorum, and to universal acceptance. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> preached the first sermon, in which is contained a par∣ticular narrative of the whole transaction; Mr. <HI>Cooke,</HI> of Cambridge, the next; then Mr. <HI>Cushing,</HI> of Waltham; Mr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> of Weston; Mr. <HI>Morrill,</HI> of Wilmington; Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummings,</HI> of Billeri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a; and Mr. <HI>Payson,</HI> of Chel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a.</NOTE></P>
<P>Were we to trace the similitude, it would be no difficult matter to point out a striking <HI>one</HI> in <HI>several</HI> particulars, though not in <HI>all.</HI> It must be confessed there are some discrepant circumstances. Thus, a sin∣gle family was concerned in the banishment of Joseph; whereas, a whole nation meditated the subjugation or ruin of the American States.</P>
<P>In the case of Joseph no murder was committed, though originally intended; but murder has been per∣petrated <HI>here,</HI> with every circumstance of cruel barba∣rity.—In these two instances they differ, but agree in many others.</P>
<P>Joseph's brethren through fear of his future exalta∣tion and aggrandisement, first intended to murder, and afterwards sold him into Egypt. Envy was the moving cause. And what greatly different excited the British king and his parliament to meditate and stir up against us, a severe civil war of near eight years conti∣nuance?
<PB N="8" REF="017807_0006_0FA31A3842FF26A0"/>
They were jealous we should one day revolt, become independent states, and rise to liberties superior to their own.</P>
<P>The elder brethren of the family meditated <HI>his</HI> ruin; and who but <HI>our</HI> elder brethren attempted to despoil us of our liberties, and reduce us to a state of vassalage? Again, Jacob's sons advanced Joseph to <HI>honor</HI> and <HI>distinction,</HI> by the very means they made use of, to <HI>humble, depress</HI> or <HI>destroy</HI> him. So in the present case, the measures made use of by <HI>Britain</HI> to enslave the in∣habitants of this country, have accelerated their <HI>inde∣pendency, sovereignty</HI> and <HI>honor.</HI> Farther, as the great Jehovah overruled the <HI>malice</HI> and <HI>envy</HI> of <HI>Joseph's</HI> brethren for the good of the whole family and Jewish nation; so the <HI>unprecedented massacre</HI> of <HI>this day,</HI> and the subsequent ravages of the British troops, through the country, though "meant by them for evil, yet the great Jehovah has overruled for good," not only to <HI>this</HI> and the United States of America, but also to <HI>some other kingdoms</HI> of the world! And may I not add, that since the causes were so similar, and the ef∣fects also, <HI>we</HI> in this country ought to resolve as Jo∣seph did, not <HI>so</HI> to remember the injury done and de∣signed, as to ill treat or forbear acts of kindness to the people of Britain; from whom our ancestors de∣scended, to whom we are consequently related, and with whom we symbolize in <HI>religion, language</HI> and <HI>laws.</HI></P>
<P>Before we proceed to point out the happy effects of the war just concluded, to <HI>this</HI> and <HI>other parts</HI> of the world, it may be proper to make some <HI>strictures</HI> on the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>trine that is held forth by the text.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017807_0007_0FA31A3903D98110"/><HI>This</HI> and <HI>some similar passages</HI> of scripture have been much quoted of late by a certain <HI>new</HI> and <HI>upstart</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct to prove that God is the efficient cause of sin.— In support of this novel doctrine, they quote not only my tex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but such passages as the following—"<HI>I form the light and create darkness, I make peace and create evil; I the Lord do all these things</HI>". And again; "<HI>Is there evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI>" These passages, methinks, are greatly wrested. For they refer not to <HI>moral</HI> but to <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>penal</HI> evil, as has been the confession of the <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>learned</HI> in former ages, a <HI>very few</HI> only excepted. They are now pressed into the service of a particular sect, who would make the wondering world be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eve, that they are the authors of new discoveries, and have unraveled a difficulty which has nonplused the brightest geniuses in former and latter times! But, pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e apart, who could suppose that the above-mentioned passages coun∣tenance any such sentiment? a sentiment repugnant to the moral character of the Deity, which subverts the order of nature, and makes an holy GOD very like to his grand antagonist, the Devil! To suppose that GOD cannot effect his designs without bringing sin upon the stage, or influen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing moral agents to the perpetration of it, is to imagine <HI>that all powerful</HI> and <HI>perfect Being</HI> to be weak and impotent, and altoge∣ther such an one as ourselves!</P>
<P>It is true, the great <HI>Jehovah</HI> has certain plans of providence which he carries on, and never wants means to effect. But is it not contrary to the true meaning of Scripture, and the <HI>common sense</HI> of man∣kind, to assert that he is the <HI>efficient</HI> cause of sin, and that he influences men to commit it, in order to effect his designs? There is no need of this; for if good <HI>must</HI> be brought about by the wickedness of men,
<PB N="10" REF="017807_0008_0FA31A39C326F220"/>
there is forever a sufficient number of moral, free agents, who, prompted by the devil, and their own hearts lusts, are ready to do that, which under the superin∣tending providence of God, is overruled and finally terminates, either to the <HI>general good</HI> of the system, or to a <HI>particular</HI> part of it.</P>
<P>The brethren of Joseph, filled with envy and ambi∣tion, could not brook his dreams, nor bear his party-colour'd coat; and therefore conceived a design to murder, or some way get rid of him: But the great GOD, <HI>known unto whom are all his works, from the beginning of the world; whose counsel shall stand, and who will do all his pleasure,</HI> made these same passions subservient to his particular purpose. <HI>They</HI> intended to gratify their malice, but <HI>He</HI> to indulge his bound∣less philanthropy and benevolence. Now I would ask. Is there not a mighty difference between GOD's <HI>permitting</HI> these brethren the gratification of their hearts desire, and governing it to the public good, and his being the <HI>efficient</HI> cause of their behavior? The <HI>latter</HI> opinion makes men machines; the <HI>former</HI> is consistent with that freedom which is <HI>essential</HI> to ra∣tional beings—to moral agents.</P>
<P>I have observed, that GOD has general plans of providence, which he is ever carrying into execution, and which he some times accomplishes through the lusts and passions of men.—I will mention a few in∣stances out of very many.—It was the will of heaven that a seven years drought should come upon the <HI>eastern world,</HI> and that the posterity of <HI>Abraham,</HI> then in <HI>Canaan</HI>▪ should be preserved from the fatal influ∣ence of it. This could not be better effected, in the common course of things, than by having a prudent man of their own number sent before them into <HI>Egypt,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="017807_0009_0FA31A3A84BF2620"/>
that garden of the world, who, having a foresight of the impending scarcity and through a variety of ad∣verse fortune, being raised to <HI>distinction</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> should cause the erection of granaries, by stores sea∣sonably accumulated in which, the <HI>posterity</HI> of <HI>Jacob,</HI> as well as others, should be preserved from the sad consequences of a <HI>severe</HI> and <HI>long continued scarcity.</HI> This scheme was executed by the malice and envy of Jacob's sons, who sold their brother with no other view than to be rid of his pretended, haughty and im∣perious temper. Now, through whose efficiency was this barbarous banishment brought about? God's? or Satan's? Let scripture and common sense decide.</P>
<P>Indeed, some persons pretend that God influences to the <HI>opus operatum,</HI> to the outward action, but not to the sinfulness of it. This appears to me, a lame ac∣count of the matter. It will not quadrate with the case referred <HI>to</HI> in the text. How can we, in that in∣stance, separate the action from the obliquity of it? To <HI>kill,</HI> or to <HI>banish</HI> persons, under <HI>some</HI> circumstan∣ces, is a virtuous action, a laudable deed, when they have <HI>forfeited</HI> their lives or <HI>merited</HI> exile. But how can the same be done to innocent persons without guilt? And if there was guilt, to whom is it to be imputed? To God, or to Jacob's sons? Let God be holy, but every man a sinner.</P>
<P>In after ages, the Jews were to be redeemed from <HI>Egypt</HI> by an out stretched arm. The great Jehovah, in that idolatrous country, and <HI>emporium</HI> of the world, chose to display his wonderful w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks, and his evident superiority to the false gods of the Heathen. Nothing gave a greater scope for this, than the obstinacy of <HI>Pha∣raoh,</HI> the reigning prince, who refused to let the chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> go out of his dominions, till the most
<PB N="12" REF="017807_0010_0FA31A3B4570D668"/>
<HI>astonishing judgments</HI> were sent, and <HI>miracles</HI> wrought in the land of <HI>Ham!</HI> But we are not from hence to conclude that God by his efficiency produced this pra∣vity of disposition, in the <HI>Egygtian</HI> king. All that was necessary, was to raise to the throne, and cause to stand <HI>there</HI> a certain man, whose avarice, ambition and tyranny prompted him to detain the posterity of <HI>Israel</HI> in his kingdom, till Jehovah demonstrated himself to be the true God of the universe. There is one ob∣jection to this account of the matter: the scripture as∣serts, in direct and positive terms, that <HI>God hardened Pharoah's</HI> heart. It also says in other places▪ that <HI>he hardened his own heart</HI>; nothing more, therefore, can re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sonably be intended thereby, than that God <HI>permitted</HI> him to follow the evil dispositions of his heart, <HI>left</HI> him exposed to the temptations of the world and the devil, <HI>took</HI> from him his holy spirit, and <HI>brought</HI> him into such trials, as meeting with a perverse temper, render∣ed it more so; not that he used any positive influence in the production of this event.</P>
<P>Farther, it was the will of heaven, a scheme in pro∣vidence, that the people of <HI>Israel</HI> should be planted down in the land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> To this end the antient inhabitants <HI>must</HI> be exterminated. <HI>They</HI> were left there∣fore, to fill up the measure of their iniquity, that so the Jews might be justified, in the destruction of them. To suppose God made them wicked by his own <HI>effi∣ciency,</HI> is to imagine that he was reduced to the <HI>hard necessity</HI> of justifying one sin by the production of another, than which nothing can be more injurious or absurd.</P>
<P>Again; The <HI>Jews</HI> after being sometime planted in <HI>Canaan</HI> become extremely vile; so that, agreeable to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nature of the divine government, it was ne∣cessary
<PB N="13" REF="017807_0011_0FA31A3C058F9198"/>
they should be punished by captivity. There were those who were ready to carry this design into execution. <HI>Senacharib</HI> undertook the service: but it was far from his intention, to fulfill the designs or exe∣cute the <HI>plans</HI> of heaven; all that he meant was to gratify his <HI>lust</HI> of <HI>domination</HI> and <HI>conquest.</HI> According∣ly we find the Almighty thus declaring, <HI>I will pu∣nish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria. He meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.</HI></P>
<P>Once more: It was the scheme or plan of provi∣dence, to redeem the fallen world by the <HI>advent</HI> and <HI>sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> In order to accomplish this benevolent plan, the Saviour of the world must be put to a <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>ignominious</HI> death. <HI>Judas</HI> and the people of the <HI>Jews</HI> stood ready to accomplish the deed, which, though nefarious in itself, was productive of the happiest consequences to the world. The per∣petrators were actuated by the worst of principles. <HI>Sa∣tan</HI>▪ through the door of avarice, entered into <HI>Judas,</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI> declares, that his murderers in general were moved by an evil spirit, and practised with wick∣ed hands.—<HI>Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.</HI>"—From these examples it plainly appears, that though there be <HI>gene∣ral schemes of</HI> providence which will be executed; yet we are by no means obliged to recur to the <HI>blasphe∣mous assertions</HI> of some <HI>late dogmatists,</HI> who tell us, that as the plan was from heaven, the evil principles by which it was accomplished were from God.</P>
<P>These instances being previously mentioned, and commented on, we shall apply the whole to the me∣morable
<PB N="14" REF="017807_0012_0FA31A3CC3BA1DE8"/>
revolution that has lately taken place in this country.</P>
<P>It was the will of heaven, and agreeable to his gene∣ral plan, that the <HI>principal part</HI> of <HI>America</HI> should be∣come <HI>separate</HI> and <HI>independent</HI> of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>This separation <HI>must</HI> be brought about, like most other events, by the <HI>agency</HI> of men. <HI>America <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st</HI> revolt; and some incidents <HI>must</HI> take place, to induce or excite them thus to do. The <HI>avarice</HI> and <HI>tyranny</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> soon led them to this. Instigated by those restless desires, <HI>they</HI> imposed heavy burthens grievous to be borne; revoked our <HI>charters, shut</HI> up our ports; <HI>changed</HI> the mode of criminal prosecution; <HI>quartered</HI> a body of armed men upon us, who insulted the inha∣bitants; and finally, to complete the system of oppres∣sion, <HI>excited</HI> the <HI>dogs</HI> of <HI>war,</HI> the <HI>sons</HI> of <HI>violence,</HI> to <HI>butcher innocent</HI> and <HI>unoffending</HI> men. The first at∣tack was made upon the <HI>militia</HI> of this town, who, on∣ly because they appeared in arms, and thereby demon∣strated that they would not be <HI>tame spectators</HI> of every <HI>outrage, insult</HI> and <HI>abus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> were, in a most <HI>inhuman manner,</HI> cut down, and eight of them had their souls instantly dislodged from their bodies. As soon as the <HI>fame</HI> of this <HI>barbarous deed</HI> had reached the distant colonies, <HI>all America</HI> rose as one man to arms, to avenge the wrong done to their fellow-countrymen! The <HI>British</HI> troops, indeed, marked their progress through <HI>this</HI> and the <HI>neighbouring towns</HI> on that <HI>memorable day,</HI> which we now solemnize, with such characters, of un∣heard of barbarity, that all to whose ears it came, were ready to say, <HI>that no such deed had been done in Ameri∣ca</HI> since its first settlement to that time.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I am sensible, that acts of greater barbarity in themselves considered, have sometimes been committed against the <HI>Ame∣ricans</HI> by the <HI>aboriginals</HI> of the country. But still, when all circumstances are duly considered, the affair at <HI>Lexingt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> may be pronounced cruel beyond a parallel. This will appear, if we for a moment reflect upon the <HI>cause</HI> and the <HI>author<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of this <HI>detestable</HI> deed.

At least, we ought to forgive them, bear them no ha∣tred, and pray to God that none of the evil they have done us, may finally be laid to their charge. This I know is a hard duty, but it is such as we are bound to comply with. As a preacher of the gospel I am obliged to recommend it to whomsoever I have the honor publicly to speak. If we feel the smart of the blows inflicted, the duty of forgiveness is still more difficult. Now this is our case.

and <HI>now</HI> had no <HI>sufficient cause</HI> to hurt, much less to kill, how aggravating the circumstance, how pun∣gent the grief! For these reasons you are excited, <HI>on this occasion,</HI> to shed tears of grief; and also, that your friends had not lived to share with you the im∣portant blessings of <HI>independency</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> to which they so greatly contributed.—But then, on other ac∣counts, you are called to shed the <HI>tears</HI> of <HI>joy:</HI> In particular, that your <HI>friends</HI> and <HI>townsmen</HI> died in so good a cause, that they fell the first <HI>victims,</HI> and were made a <HI>sacrifice</HI> for the good of their country. Every generous and disinterested soul, forgetting the ties of blood, is prompted thus to do. Even the mothers of heroic youths, among the <HI>Romans</HI>▪ though of the ten∣der sex, have been known to rejoice that their sons were slain in battle, and died in the cause and for the honor of their country! <HI>Quam dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori,</HI> was a principle with them. It is also a maxim of reason and no less so of the gospel, <HI>that it is better that one man,</HI> nay that <HI>many men</HI> should die, than that the <HI>whole nation should perish.</HI> Since then, the murder <HI>here</HI> committed by the <HI>British</HI> troops, has been followed with happy consequences, has preserved this country from slavery or destruction, the consideration thereof should cause <HI>townsmen,</HI> and even <HI>relations</HI> to dry up their tears of sorrow, and excite them to weep tears of joy.</P>
<P>But when I have mentioned the death of your friends, I have told but a part of the bitter tale.

<P><PB N="22" REF="017807_0020_0FA31A42C2D85CF0"/>But notwithstanding all this, it is certainly our duty to forgive, if not to forget.

<P>But though it be impossible to forget the late trans∣actions on the stage of <HI>America,</HI>—yet certainly the laws of Christianity oblige us to forgive. The duty of forgiveness Heaven does not extend so far as to oblige us to make the offenders our confidents and friends— to trust them for the future, or receive them into our intimate communion: it only requires, that we bear them no ill-will— take no steps for revenge—and re∣commend them to the mercy of God. We must <HI>bless them that curse us, and pray for them that despitefully use and entreat us,</HI> if we would be the <HI>children of our Father in Heaven, who causes his sun to rise on the e∣vil, and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just, and on the unjust.</HI> If we are his children, and possessed with a humane and benevolent heart, we shall bitterly la∣ment those wars and fightings, which the lusts of men create.

<P>Now, would it not be deemed impertinent or super∣fluous, I could easily point out the great advantage that has accrued to some <HI>other countries</HI> as well as to <HI>this</HI> from the late <HI>American</HI> war. Before the contest with this western world, the spirit and the idea of li∣berty, was almost lost from Europe, as it had been long before from Asia and Africa. This dispute aroused it in Ireland, who before were fettered in chains of severe bondage. Poverty and oppression reigned in that island. Their trade was most invidiously re∣stricted; <HI>pensioners</HI> were saddled upon them; their <HI>taxes</HI> were heavy, and their <HI>rents</HI> from <HI>landlords</HI> who lived in <HI>England,</HI> enormous; by means of all which, the common ranks of people became excessively poor, and from the greatest industry could scarcely procure a mouthful of meat for themselves and family more than once a week. But seeing the spirit raging in America, they caught the heavenly fire, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their hands made a bold demand of their
<PB N="25" REF="017807_0023_0FA31A4502DCECE8"/>
rights, &amp; never desisted▪ till England granted their request, unfettered their trade, and <HI>now</HI> permit them to live upon terms of reciprocity with themselves! A glorious ef∣fect of the American war! Farther, the king of <HI>France</HI> has given free toleration to his Protestant subjects, and al∣lows them to build their churches, undisturbed in any part of his kingdom! The king of Spain has put an end to the <HI>Inquisition</HI>; and from the ratified articles of peace between these two latter kingdoms and <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> it should seem, that it is made upon more liberal principles than commonly has been between <HI>Protes∣tant</HI> and <HI>Popish</HI> kingdoms. But what is the most considerable, the confederated States of <HI>America</HI> have in consequence of our struggles, become <HI>free, sove∣reign</HI> and <HI>independent</HI> Independency and freedom are the wish of all men. Freedom, indeed, may be abused to purposes of licentiousness, and what other blessing may not be abused? But, if it be not our own fault, we may <HI>now</HI> be the happiest people upon the face of the globe! Instead of being controuled by others, at three thousand miles distance, we <HI>now</HI> have it in our power to rule and govern ourselves, to im∣pose our own taxes, choose all our officers, regulate our internal police, and rise under the influence of our virtues, to eminent distinction and renown!</P>
<P>We have at present a happy constitution of go∣vernment, framed by wise men and accepted by a majority of the people at large. If we adhere to the spirit of it, and labor to give energy to the laws, and dignity to the governing authority, by electing <HI>wise men</HI> and <HI>true,</HI> and then submitting chearfully to their commands, we shall doubtless taste the sweets of that liberty for which we have bled at every vein.</P>
<P>It is not only natural for nations to wish to be in∣dependent, as the minor pants for twenty-one; but
<PB N="26" REF="017807_0024_0FA31A45C48F8AA0"/>
it must be highly eligible and advantageous to be sepa∣rated from <HI>Britain.</HI> Whilst connected with them our <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> would ever have been in danger. Their examples would have had a pernicious influ∣ence on our morals. Their extensive comme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce has given them wealth, and wealth by a natural causality has produced luxury; and luxury, effeminacy. These vices are extremely contagious; and if we had been <HI>connected</HI> with and <HI>dependent</HI> on them, should have been very prone to have aped them in their vices as well as in their virtues; and such vices as those above-mentioned, would have been highly detrimental to an infant country. May God long preserve us from them.</P>
<P>Besides, being in connection with them, we must frequently have been embroiled in their broils; which we know in time past have been frequent and nume∣rous; and probably will be so for the future.</P>
<P>Monarchies are often in war, with a view to extend the domains of a single man, whilst Commonwealths are na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urally pacific; because the benefit resulting from conquest, being divided among the ruling body, which is numerous and often shifted, or among the commu∣nity at large, is not a sufficient <HI>stimu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> to war.— Hence <HI>Holland, Switzerland,</HI> and other republican states are never, except through necessity, engaged in national disputes; though the latter republic, it is well known, furnishes a plenty of the best soldiers, who are often the mercinary troops of crowned heads.</P>
<P>Having therefore assumed republican governments, and being <HI>now</HI> separated from <HI>Britain,</HI> and not obli∣ged to follow her <HI>inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ination</HI> or her <HI>fortune,</HI> there is the highest probability, that we shall enjoy a <HI>lasting,</HI> if not a <HI>perpetual</HI> peace; and that this would be a preci∣ous
<PB N="27" REF="017807_0025_0FA31A46848F53F0"/>
boon, a glorious advantage, we must needs be convinced from the late long continued horrors of war; for if war be a judgment (which by sad experience we all know to be fact) doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less peace is a blessing. If we are in peace we shall be at leisure for the noblest purposes; for the service of God; for being <HI>deliver∣ed out of the hands of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, in righteousness and holiness all the days of our lives</HI>;—for the cultivation of the arts and sci∣ences, which never flourish in a time of war;—for the extension of commerce and a lucrative navigation";— for the improvement of agriculture; and the diffusion of the blessings of good government, and liberty to all around us.</P>
<P>When rapt into future times, we contemplate the great things which will be acted on the stage of <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>; how she will bless her numerous sons; how pro∣duce <HI>legislators, politicians, orators</HI> and <HI>poets,</HI> equal to the most renowned of antiq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, and how she will rise to opu∣lence, fame and glory; unless it be her own fault, we must feel ourselves not only willing to forgive the people of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> who by the infatuation of their councils, have been the undesigned instruments of so much good; but can also bless God, most heartily, that he has been <HI>so</HI> ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to us, whilst in pleasing gratitude we can adopt the words of the prophet, and with but a little alteratio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, say, "<HI>Happy art thou, O America! who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thine excellency!</HI>"</P>
<P>I cannot, with decency, conclude without addres∣sing myself to the gentlemen now in arms:—</P>
<P>RESPECTABLE SIRS,</P>
<P>WHILST we revere your character, as soldiers, we cannot but lament those lusts and passions of men

which make your profession necessary, and entitle you to deserved esteem.</P>
<P>In the present state of the world, no body of men is more important than <HI>that</HI> which is acquainted with the dexterous use of the instruments of death, and has studied the arts of killing! A <HI>well regulated militia</HI> is the glory and defence of every country. They are a greater security than <HI>standing armies,</HI> who, though necessary in time of war, are ever dangerous in peace. The liberties of <HI>Athens,</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and of many other places, have been destroyed by them. Our rulers, knowing their pernicious influence in other parts of the world, have resolved they shall not be maintained <HI>here</HI> in times of peace. Soon, there∣fore, may we expect to hear that our <HI>army</HI> is dis∣banded, and then our dependance will be altogether on the <HI>militia.</HI> And indeed on whom can we rely for safety better than on them? Memorable have been their exploits in former times. It was by the <HI>militia</HI> that <HI>England</HI> anciently penetrated to the gates of <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> took their <HI>fleurs de lis,</HI> and almost conquered that <HI>great</HI> and <HI>potent</HI> kingdom. And what noble feats have they not performed during the progress of the war but lately finished? Principally by their exer∣tions <HI>Burgoyne</HI> and his powerful army were captiva∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and lost their power to hurt.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I thus commend our <HI>militias,</HI> I certainly mean no reflection on our <HI>standing army.</HI> Great is their merit and much have they done, under <HI>Washington</HI> one of the <HI>wisest</HI> and <HI>best</HI> of generals towards bringing forward the present happy aera. Their toils and labors, their patience and perseverance, under peculiar discouragements, are unexampled in history! To such an height of discipline and skill, of bravery and prowess, have they arrived, that we should not fear to have them meet in the open field, an equal number of the best vete∣ran troops in the world. A large <HI>British army</HI> was cooped up by them, and with the assistance of the French, <HI>Cornwal∣lis,</HI> with his numerous host, fell an easy prey to their ma∣noeuvres and undaunted courage. Now that they are about to leave the camp, with their brows encircled with the lau∣rels of victory, may they cheerfully return to the peaceful walks of life, and by the several States who employed them, have equal justice done, and a reasonable compensation for all their former sufferings.</NOTE> Considering,

therefore, gentlemen, the importance of your charac∣ter and the expectations of the people, you will be persuaded to persevere in measures for the acquire∣ment of greater military capacity to do good. Peace will justify no relaxation in this regard. As the country, for ought we know, may soon be attacked, and need your assistance, so we trust you will labor to be qualified and disposed to give it. To your con∣duct, under GOD, we are much indebted for the present independent station we hold among the nations of the earth; for here the corner stone thereof was laid. As you early stept forth, lent your aid to your country, and made a sacrifice in her cause, at a time when she needed the assistance of all her sons; so we trust, should there be any future call, you will be prompt in obedience to it. How glorious to be hailed, like <HI>Camillus,</HI> the saviours of your country!</P>
<P>The deaths of those who from your body were slain, as on this day, by <HI>British cruelty,</HI> have been suitably <HI>noticed</HI> and <HI>resented</HI>; and that you have not yet for∣gotten them is evident from your appearing in hostile array in the house of God.</P>
<P>You have acted a laudable part in observing this <HI>an∣niversary</HI> to the present day. It has answered a most
<PB N="30" REF="017807_0028_0FA31A48C2D05E10"/>
valuable political purpose, as well as demonstrated a decent respect to the memory of those who first bled in their country's cause. What may be the line of propriety for the future, I shall not take upon me to say, and for this reason, because I do not particularly know. This, however, I may be permitted to ob∣serve in general, that the ends of this institution being chiefly secured, the call for its continuance cannot be great. To <HI>you</HI> it belongs to determine, and to <HI>you</HI> it is left. But if you continue the solemnization of the anniversary, yet you will not perpetuate your resent∣ment against the inhabitants of <HI>Britain.</HI> It is unbeco∣ming the character, both of ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istians and soldiers so to do. As the good soldier is brave in war, he is no less humane and gentle in peace. "<HI>Better is he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</HI>" Whilst, therefore, you bless the ashes of your departed friends▪ you will eradicate from your breasts the spirit of re∣venge, and all forbidden resentment to the living; and exert yourselves <HI>so</HI> to pass through life, that when death shall lay its cold hand upon you, and call you hence, you may be ripened <HI>for,</HI> and through grace in the divine Redeemer, be admited <HI>to</HI> that glorious world, where wars and fightings never enter, where harmony and love perpetually reign!</P>
<P>And now turning myself to this numerous assembly, I would, in the fulness of my heart, congratulate you on the return of peace with its olive branch, after the toils and perplexi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, the strates and horrors of mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e than a seven years war!

have escaped! And not only escaped, but are placed on the <HI>stable rock</HI> of independence, and are brought to an honorable and advantageous peace. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Parliament of Britain seem to be discontented, and murmur at the peace, as being made, in their view▪ on terms ingl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rious to the nation. But be this as it will surely we, of this country, have the utmost reason to acquiesce in it, and with a mixture of joy and astonishment, take notice of the hand of Providence in accelerating this important event, and establishing it on terms <HI>so honorable</HI> to <HI>America.</HI> Our most sanguine wishes are gratified, and expectations out done! Who could have thought, when the object in dispute, was of <HI>such</HI> magnitude, that <HI>Britain</HI> would <HI>so soon</HI> desist from her claims, consent to the dismemberment of the empire, and make <HI>so large</HI> a proportion of it, independent!

<P>That we may perceive in the most lively manner, the blessedness of our present situation, and <HI>keenly</HI> relish the <HI>joy</HI> of the day, we need only recollect the horrors of that <HI>dreadful day,</HI> when the war first broke out in <HI>this place,</HI>

and contrast them with the present <HI>smiling aspect</HI> of di∣vine providence. <HI>That</HI> was a <HI>day</HI> of <HI>darkness</HI> and of <HI>gloomi∣ness, a day of clouds</HI> and <HI>thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains; when the people were much pained, and all faces gathered blackness.</HI> Many of you heard the <HI>sound of the trumpet, and the alarm of war</HI>; and saw the doleful <HI>spectacle of garments roll'd in blood!</HI> you saw your friends pale in death, and heard their dying groans! <HI>Distressed</HI> at what had already happened, you were no less <HI>anxious</HI> for the future. <HI>Sadness</HI> sat brooding on every face, and sorrow penetrated deep into every heart. But <HI>now</HI> the scene is mightily reversed—the incumbent gloom is dispelled, and the brightest pros∣pects open to view. <HI>That never to be forgotten morn,</HI> was ushered <HI>in</HI> by the discharge of musketry, loaded with the instruments of death! But <HI>this</HI> opened with the <HI>feu de joye,</HI> which diffused agreeable sensations thro' the soul. On <HI>that day,</HI> the <HI>British standard</HI> erected, presented a sickening prospect to the free born sons of Massachusetts: but on <HI>this,</HI> the thirteen stripes of the <HI>Ame∣rican flag,</HI> waving and wantoning in the wind, exhilirate the heart, and cause the pulse of freedom to beat high. On that doleful day, the floor of this sacred house was crimsoned with the blood of our murdered friends, and spread over with their mangled corpses; but on <HI>this,</HI> it is trod by the feet of devout worshippers, who come hither in crouds to express their gratitude to that God who has beheld us with a propitious eye, ap∣peared for our help, and turned this anniversary <HI>from sorrow to joy,</HI> and <HI>from mourning into a good day! That day</HI> saw some of the best characters of the pro∣vince proscribed, doomed to destruction, and hunted like partridges on the mountains; but <HI>this auspicious one</HI> beholds <HI>them</HI> advanced to the <HI>first seats</HI> of the go∣vernment, and enjoying the <HI>confidence</HI> and <HI>reward</HI> of

an <HI>obliged</HI> people. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the <HI>British troops</HI> came from Boston, it is belie∣ved that one part of their business was to seize, if possible, his <HI>Excellency John Hancock,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> our present Governor, and the honorable Samuel Adams, who, by their opposition to <HI>British tyranny,</HI> had rendered themselves obnoxious; and were known <HI>then</HI> to be in <HI>Lexington.</HI> They happily esca∣ped out of their hands. For having, by private posts, dis∣patched from Boston, received intelligence of the movement of a detachment of the troops, with the probable object of their view, those gentlemen arose from their beds in the dead of night, decamped, and thus escaped. They were re∣served to a better end, even to <HI>govern</HI> and bless <HI>that people</HI> with their <HI>counsels,</HI> to whose deliverance from slavery they so greatly contributed. Truly laudable was the conduct of his <HI>Excellency</HI> in making his appearance in the house of GOD on <HI>this day.</HI> His presence increased the general joy, as it gave us an opportunity of sharing it with one, who had large∣ly partook in the distresses of his country, <HI>lamented</HI> in all their <HI>sorrows,</HI> and administred to multitudes the balm of consolation. There was also a great propriety in his co∣ming up to the house of GOD with others, to testify his thankfulness to Jehovah, on this occasion, as <HI>this</HI> was the town where his <HI>pious ancestors</HI> lived; as he was upon the spot when hostilities were first commenced; as he was de∣signed to have been one of the first victims to their rage; as <HI>they</HI> came <HI>partly</HI> in pursuit of him, and he experienced the divine favor in his signal preservation on that day. The example was such as ought ever to be set by those in power, under similar circumstances.

<P>Since we can now sit under our <HI>own vines and fig-trees,</HI> having none to disturb us, or make us afraid, let us diligently cultivate the soil which has <HI>been</HI> watered by the blood of our countrymen; and beg of God that he would cause the <HI>earth to yield her increase, and the trees their fruit; that he would give us friutfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seasons,</HI> and plentiful crops: for then soon will our scarcity be followed with redundancy, and <HI>America</HI> supply the deficiencies of others.

<HEAD>APPENDIX. <HI>LEXINGTON,</HI> 22<HI>d April,</HI> 1783.</HEAD>
<P>NEITHER the public nor the world, at this time, need to be informed, that the late great and affecting contest, between <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> opened in <HI>Lexington,</HI> by the <HI>unprovoked massacre</HI> of a number of its inhabitants, perpetrated by a body of <HI>British</HI> troops, on the <HI>nineteenth</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> 1775.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> distressing <HI>day has been unto us for a memorial.</HI> As such it hath been statedly observed in this place, as an <HI>important anniversary,</HI> through the course of the late war, by a respectable appearance of the <HI>militia</HI> in arms, and a solemn assembly of the <HI>whole congregation</HI> in the house of GOD, to drop a tear upon the <HI>graves</HI> and mourn over the <HI>ashes</HI> of our <HI>slaughtered friends,</HI> religiously to notice and acknowledge the hand of GOD, —humbly to express our confidence in him, as the righteous and powerful <HI>avenger</HI> of <HI>injured innocence,</HI> and devoutly to implore his presence and aid in the cause of our country, of posterity, and mankind.</P>
<P>It hath pleased him, who is <HI>governor amongst the nations,</HI> to behold the state of an oppressed land, to hear the prayers of an afflicted people, to give them to see their desires upon their enemies, and to rejoice in his salvation, by bringing the war to an happy issue, and granting them the pleasing prospect of the blessings of a peace, in which all their rights and claims, as <HI>free, sovereign states,</HI> and an <HI>independent nation,</HI> are esta∣blished upon a permanent foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="017807_0035_0FA31A4E65600610"/>Our <HI>sorrow</HI> being thus turned into <HI>joy,</HI> and our <HI>mourning</HI> into <HI>songs of praise</HI>—decently and religiously to express the fulness of our hearts, upon this great and joyful occasion, the <HI>interesting anniversary on Sa∣turday last,</HI> was observed and celebrated in the follow∣ing manner, viz.</P>
<P>The dawn of the day was ushered in by the ringing of the bell.—The officers of the <HI>town militia,</HI> with a large number of the inhabitants, being collected toge∣ther—at five o'clock (the time when the <HI>Britons</HI> made their approach, and, without notice or provocation, <HI>inhumanly</HI> fired upon the people of this town) <HI>eight cannon,</HI> from the <HI>artillery,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>Oliver Brown,</HI> were discharged, in memory of <HI>eight</HI> of our brethren, who fell the <HI>first victims</HI> to the op∣pressor's cruelty, and <HI>martyrs</HI> in the cause of liberty, <HI>America,</HI> and mankind.</P>
<P>At the rising of the sun, a large flag of the <HI>United States</HI> appeared displayed over the house of Captain <HI>Brown,</HI> near the meeting-house and place of parade, where our brethren were <HI>slain,</HI> and <HI>thirteen cannon</HI> were discharged in commemoration of that spirit of liberty, patriotism and bravery, which, upon that af∣fecting event, fired the <HI>American's</HI> breast, and catching from soul to soul, diffused itself through this wide ex∣tended continent, and inspired the inhabitants of thir∣teen of the (then) <HI>colonies</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> as <HI>one man,</HI> to ris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <HI>revenge</HI> their <HI>brethren's blood</HI>; and, in a so∣lemn appeal to heaven, at the point of the sword, to assert, support and defend their own, and their coun∣try's rights.</P>
<P>Between twelve and one, on the arrival of the Go∣vernor, (who was present and a witness of the tragi∣cal
<PB N="38" REF="017807_0036_0FA31A4EDB364348"/>
scene, which gave rise to this anniversary, and who greatly added to the joy of the day by honoring the solemnity with his presence) a number of cannon were discharged, as a token of respect from the inhabitants of the town and a salute to his EXCELLENCY.</P>
<P>At two o'clock, a large number of the inhabitants (several of whom in years past had borne commissions from this or the United States) turning out as volun∣teers, in honor to the day, assembled in arms; and being embodied under the conduct of the present of∣ficers of the militia, performed several <HI>military ma∣neuvres</HI> to good acceptance.</P>
<P>Precisely at three o'clock, the company, command∣ed by Capt. <HI>Munroe,</HI> appeared at the house of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> and from thence escorted his Excel∣lency the Governor, and a large number of gentlemen in the ministry, and other gentlemen of character, to the meeting house, to attend divine service.</P>
<P>As the company, with the procession, were march∣ing to the house of GOD, <HI>thirteen cannon</HI> were dischar∣ged, in memory of the wisdom, firmness and patri∣otism of the <HI>thirteen colonies,</HI> in declaring themselves <HI>free, sovereign and independent states,</HI> and consolidating their union and strength into one body for glory and de∣fence, as a nation, by articles of a confederation, founded in principles of wisdom and equity, virtue and liberty, supported by the experience of ages, and approving itself to the common sense of mankind.</P>
<P>In the house of divine worship, prayers and thanks∣givings were devoutly addressed to that God who hath been with his people in distress, who has carried them thro', and who, alone, is to be exalted in their salvation;
<PB N="39" REF="017807_0037_0FA31A4F832F7DA0"/>
and an excellent and well adapted sermon, preached by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> of <HI>Lunenburgh</HI>▪ to a very crou∣ded and attentive audience, from Gen. 50.20 <HI>But as for you, ye thought evil against me, but God meant it for good,</HI> &amp;c. The exercise was closed with a psalm and an anthem, pertinent to the joyful occasion.</P>
<P>After divine service, the procession was escorted back to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s▪ by the company in arms, and three vollies fired, as a salute to his <HI>Excellency</HI> and the other gentlemen of the procession.</P>
<P>The military company then returned to the place of parade, <HI>when thirteen cannon</HI> were discharged, to celebrate the glory of victory and the joy of peace, to the <HI>Thirteen United States of America,</HI> now delivered from the calamities of war, restored to the blessings of peace, and established in their freedom, independence and sovereignty, as States and a Nation.</P>
<P>The rejoicings of the day were closed with a parting salute of three vollies, by the company in arms; and the discharge of a cannon, and the striking of the flag at the setting of the sun.</P>
