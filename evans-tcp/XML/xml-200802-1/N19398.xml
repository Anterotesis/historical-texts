<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception given to the imper∣fect account of the fever which I lately pub∣lished, and the particular desire of some of my friends, have induced me to undertake a more satisfactory history of it, in order to collect together, while facts are recent, as many of the most interesting occurrences as I could, for the information of the public.</P>
<P>I have not attempted any embellishment or ornament of stile; but have alone aimed at tel∣ling plain truths in plain language. For the de∣sultory plan of some part of the pamphlet, I have to offer the following apology; many of the circumstances and reflexions towards the conclu∣sion, which would have come with more pro∣priety in the beginning, did not occur, until some of the first half sheets were not only writ∣ten, but printed. I had no choice, therefore,
<PB N="8" REF="025255_0004_0FCCD937857F4D88"/>
but either to omit them, or place them some∣what out of order.</P>
<P>Most of the facts mentioned have fallen un∣der my own observation. Those of a different description I have been assiduous to collect from every person of credibility, possessed of infor∣mation.</P>
<P>Desirous of having this account correct and complete, I have printed off but a small num∣ber of copies of the present edition: and shall esteem myself most particularly obliged to any person who will be so kind to point out errors, to be corrected in, or suggest facts, to be added to, a new edition, which I propose to put to press very soon, and which will, I hope, be found still more ample than the present one.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter on the consideration of this disorder, it may not be improper to offer a few introductory remarks on the situation of Philadelphia previous to its commencement, which will reflect light on some of the circum∣stances mentioned in the course of the narra∣tive.</P>
<P>The manufactures, trade, and commerce of Philadelphia had, for a considerable time, been improving and extending with great rapidity. From the period of the adoption of the federal government, at which time we were at the low∣est ebb of distress, our situation had progres∣sively become more and more prosperous. Con∣fidence, formerly banished, was universally re∣stored. Property of every kind, rose to, and in
<PB N="10" REF="025255_0006_0FCCED4328BC1DA8"/>
some instances beyond, its real value▪ and a few revolving years exhibited the interesting spectacle of a young country, with a new form of government, emerging from a state approach∣ing very near to anarchy, and acquiring all the stability and nerve of the best-toned and oldest nations.</P>
<P>In this prosperity, which revived the hopes of four millions of people, Philadelphia participa∣ted in an eminent degree. New houses, in al∣most every street, built in a very neat, elegant stile, adorned, at the same time that they en∣larged the city. Its population was extending fast. House rent had risen to a most extravagant height; it was in many cases double, and in some treble what it had been a year or two be∣fore; and, as is generally the case, when a city is thriving, it went far beyond the real increase of trade. The number of applicants for houses, exceeding the number of houses to be let, one bid over another; and affairs were in such a situa∣tion, that many people, though they had a tole∣rable run of business, could hardly do more than clear their rents, and were, literally, toiling for
<PB N="11" REF="025255_0007_0FCCED45084A8730"/>
their landlords alone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The distress arising from this soure, was perhaps the only exception to the general observation of the flourish∣ing situation of Philadelphia.</NOTE>. Luxury, the usual, and perhaps inevitable concomitant of prosperity, was gaining ground in a manner very alarming to those who considered how far the virtue, the liberty, and the happiness of a nation depend on their temperance and sober manners. Men had been for some time in the habit of regulating their expenses by prospects formed in sanguine hours, when every probability was caught at as a certainty, not by their actual profits, or in∣come. The number of coaches, coachees, chairs, &amp;c. lately set up by men in the middle rank of life, is hardly credible. And although there had been a very great increase of hackney chairs, yet it was hardly ever possible to procure one on a Sunday, unless it was engaged two or three days before. Extravagance, in various shapes, was gradually eradicating the plain and whole∣some habits of the city. And although it were presumption to attempt to scan the decrees of heaven, yet few, I believe, will pretend to deny,
<PB N="12" REF="025255_0008_0FCCED46E62044E8"/>
that something was wanting to humble the pride of a city, which was running on in full ca∣reer, to the goal of prodigality and dissipation.</P>
<P>However, from November 1792, to the end of last June, the difficulties of Philadelphia were extreme. The establishment of the bank of Pennsylvania, in embryo for the most part of that time, had arrested in the other banks such a quantity of the circulating specie, as embarras∣sed almost every kind of business; to this was added the distress arising from the very nume∣rous failures in England, which had extremely harrassed several of our capital merchants. Dur∣ing this period, many men experienced as great difficulties as were ever known in this city<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It is with great pleasure, I embrace this opportunity of declaring, that the very liberal conduct of the bank of the united states, at this trying season, was the means of saving many a deserving and industrious man from ruin.</NOTE>. But the opening, in July, of the bank of Penn∣sylvania, conducted on the most liberal princi∣ples, placed business on its former favourable
<PB N="13" REF="025255_0009_0FCCED4B7ABDC3F8"/>
footing. Every man looked forward to this fall as likely to produce a vast extension of trade. But how fleeting are all human views! how un∣certain all plans founded on earthly appearan∣ces! All these flattering prospects vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision.</P>
<P>In July, arrived the unfortunate fugitives from Cape François. And on this occasion, the liberality of Philadelphia was displayed in a most respectable point of light. Nearly 12,000 dol∣lars were in a few days collected for their relief. Little, alas! did many of the contributors, then in easy circumstances, imagine, that a few weeks would leave their wives and children dependent on the public charity, as has since unfortunate∣ly happened. An awful instance of the rapid and warning vicissitudes of affairs on this tran∣sitory stage.</P>
<P>At this time, the destroying scourge crept in among us, and nipped in the bud the fairest blossoms that imagination could form. And, oh! what dreadful contrast has since taken place! Many of our first commercial houses are totally dissolved, by the death of the parties,
<PB N="14" REF="025255_0010_0FCCED4D0B6ABEA8"/>
and their affairs are necessarily left in so derang∣ed a state that the losses and distresses which must take place, are beyond estimation. The protests of notes for a few weeks past, have been beyond all former example; for most of the principal merchants having left the city, and been totally unable, from the stagnation of busi∣ness, and diversion of all their expected resources, to make any provision for payment, many of their notes have been protested, as they became due. The bank of the united states, passed, on the 15th of October, a resolve, empowering their cashier to renew all discounted notes, when the same drawers and indorsers were of∣fered, and declaring that no notes should be protested, when the indorsers bound themselves in writing, to be acountable in the same man∣ner as in cases of protest.</P>
<P>Besides what we have already suffered, we are menaced with another evil, which proba∣bly at any other period, would not very mate∣rially injure the city; but if it comes in addition to our present distress, will operate against us a very long time. I mean the removal of congress. The meeting of this body is fixed for the first
<PB N="15" REF="025255_0011_0FCCED4E5B747910"/>
Monday in December; and it is not improba∣ble that attempts will be made to prevent their next session being held here. Appeals will be made to their fears. Already the New York pa∣pers announce,
<Q>that as congress cannot meet, agreeably to their adjournment, with any probability of safety in Philadelphia, under its present calamitous visitation, there can be no doubt of their adjourning to sit in New York, where the air is perfectly salubrious, the markets plentiful, and every conveniency ready for their accommodation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Columbian Gazetteer, October 17, 1793.</NOTE>.</Q>
If, at the time of their meeting, any trace of the disorder remains, the Philadelphians will not urge their stay here. But if it be, as there is every probability, absolutely extinguished, we place too much reliance on their justice to suspect that they will add to the stroke we have felt.</P>
<P>For these prefatory observations I hope I shall be pardoned. I now proceed to the melancholy subject I have undertaken.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="025255_0012_0FCCED4FE5E8BA28"/>The malignant fever, which has committed such ravages in Philadelphia, made its appear∣ance here, about the end of July. Dr. Hodge's child, probably the first victim, was taken ill on the 26th or 27th of July, and died on the 6th or 7th of August. A Mr. Moore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This man had been walking along the wharves, where the coffee lay, and at which the Sans Culottes was moored, in the morning; and on his return home, was so extremely ill, as to be obliged to go to bed, from which he never rose again.</NOTE>, in Mr. Denny's lodging house, in Water street, was seized on Friday, the 2d of August, and died on Sunday, the fourth. Mrs. Parkinson, who lodged in the same house, caught the disorder, on the 3d of August, and died on the 7th.</P>
<P>On the origin of the disorder, there prevails a very great diversity of opinion. Dr. Hutchin∣son maintained that it was not imported, and stated, in a letter which he wrote on the sub∣ject to Captain Falconer, the health officer of the port of Philadelphia, that
<Q>the general opinion was, that the disorder originated from some damaged coffee, or other putrified vegeta∣ble and animal matters.</Q>
To this opinion,
<PB N="17" REF="025255_0013_0FCCED52C8F7FD70"/>
though he did not give it absolutely as his own, he seemed strongly to incline; and mentioned, that at a wharf, a little above Arch-street, there was not only a quantity of damaged cof∣fee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The stench of this coffee was so excessively offensive, that the people in the neighbourhood could hardly bear to remain in the back part of their houses.</NOTE>, extremely offensive, but also some putrid animal and vegetable substances. The doctor rested his opinion, that the disorder was not imported, on two circumstances, which prove to be mistaken, viz. that no foreigners or sailors were infected on the 27th of August, the time of writing, and that it had not been found in lodging houses. This opinion was so far from being just, that the second place in which it is known to have made its appearance, was a lodg∣ing house, and some of the earliest patients were French lads.</P>
<P>Dr. Rush is of the same opinion with dr. Hut∣chinson, and says he has in his possession sufficient documents to prove that the disorder is not an imported one, but of native growth. As he has
<PB N="18" REF="025255_0014_0FCCED53A136AF80"/>
not yet communicated his proofs to the public, it is impossible to decide on them.</P>
<P>That it is an imported disorder, is the opini∣on of most of the inhabitants of Philadelphia. However, there is much diversity of sentiment, as to the time and manner of its introduction. I shall state some of the various reports current, and let the reader judge for himself.</P>
<P>Some assert, that it was brought by Il Constante, commanded by Coulon, which ar∣rived here from Ragusa, and Martinico, about the beginning of May. This is very unlikely, as the lower part of the city, where she lay, was free until the disorder spread there from the up∣per part.</P>
<P>Another opinion is, that it was introduced by the Mary, captain Rush, which arrived here on the 7th of August, with some of the French emigrants from the cape. But the existence of the disorder previous to her arrival, sets aside this opinion at once.</P>
<P>Others again say that a vessel from Tobago▪
<PB N="19" REF="025255_0015_0FCCED552AB00E08"/>
which arrived here in July, lost nearly all her hands with a malignant fever. In the river, she shipped fresh hands, many of whom died. From her they believe the disorder spread. With re∣spect to this report, I cannot aver any thing.</P>
<P>The most probable and general opinion is, that the privateer Sans Culottes, with her prize, the Flora, which arrived here the 22d of July, intro∣duced the fever. The privateer was in a foul, dirty condition—her hold very small—and perhaps as ill calculated for the accommodation of the great number of people that were on board, as any vessel that ever crossed the ocean. All her silth was emptied at a wharf between Arch and Race-street. A dead body, sewed up in canvass, lay on board the Flora, for some time, and was seen by mr. Lemaigre and other gentlemen. Several respec∣table inhabitants of Water-street declare, that sundry dead bodies were privately landed in the night, from the privateer and her prize.</P>
<P>Before I dismiss this part of the subject, it may not be amiss to mention, that many believe we have had two disorders in the city, introdu∣ced about the same time, the yellow fever, from
<PB N="20" REF="025255_0016_0FCCED56DC534820"/>
the West Indies, and a species of pestilence from Marseilles.</P>
<P>The mortality began about that part of Wa∣ter-street, where the Sans Culottes lay. For some time it was entirely confined to that place and its neighbourhood. Almost every death which occurred in the early stage of the disorder could be without difficulty traced to that street. By degrees, it spread, owing to the want of precaution, and to communication with the infected. It is said, and generally be∣lieved, that the beds and bedding of those who died of the disorder, at first, before the alarm went abroad, were sold, and spread it among the buyers.</P>
<P>Several persons were swept away before any great alarm was excited. The first deaths that attracted public notice, and struck terror among the citizens, were those of Peter Aston, on the 19th, of Mrs. Lemaigre, on the 20th, and of Thomas Miller, on the 25th of August. About this time began the removals from the city, which were for some weeks so general, that al∣most every hour in the day, carts, waggons,
<PB N="21" REF="025255_0017_0FCCED583B5C1F08"/>
coachees, and chairs, were to be seen transport∣ing families and furniture to the country in every direction. Business then became extreme∣ly dull. Mechanics and artists were unemployed; and the streets wore the appearance of gloom and melancholy.</P>
<P>The first official notice taken of the disorder, was on the 22d of August, on which day, the mayor of Philadelphia, Matthew Clarkson, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sq. wrote to the city commissioners, and after ac∣quainting them with the state of the city, gave them the most peremptory orders, to have the streets properly cleansed and purified by the scavengers, and all the filth immedi∣ately hawled away. These orders were re∣peated on the 27th, and similar ones given to the clerks of the market. The 29th the gover∣nor of the state, in his address to the legislature, acquainted them, that a contagious disorder existed in the city; and that he had taken every proper measure to ascertain the origin, nature, and extent of it. He likewise assured them that the health officer and physician of the port, would take every precaution to allay and re∣move the public inquietude.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="025255_0018_0FCCED5998767B50"/>The 26th of the same month, the college of physicians had a meeting, at which they took into consideration the nature of the disorder, and the means of prevention and of cure. They published an address to the citizens, sign∣ed by the president and secretary, recommend∣ing to avoid all unnecessary intercourse with the infected; to place marks on the doors or win∣dows where they were; to pay great attention to cleanliness and airing the rooms of the sick; to provide a large and airy hospital in the neighbourhood of the city for their reception; to put a stop to the tolling of the bells; to bury those who died of the disorder in carriages and as privately as possible; to keep the streets and wharves clean; to avoid all fatigue of body and mind, and standing or sitting in the sun, or in the open air; to accommodate the dress to the weather, and to exceed rather in warm than in cool clothing; and to avoid intemperance, but to use fermented liquors, such as wine, beer, and cider, with moderation. They likewise de∣clared their opinion, that fires in the streets were very dangerous, if not ineffectual means of stopping the progress of the fever, and that they placed more dependence on the burning of
<PB N="23" REF="025255_0019_0FCCED5D514C63F8"/>
gunpowder. The benefits of vinegar and cam∣phor, they added, were confined chiefly to in∣fected rooms, and could not be too often used on handkerchiefs, or in smelling bottles, by persons who attended the sick.</P>
<P>In consequence of this address, the bells were immediately stopped from tolling, which was a measure very expedient; as they had before been kept pretty constantly going the whole day, so as to terrify those in health, and drive the sick, as far as the influence of imagination could produce that effect, to their graves. An idea had gone abroad, that the burning of fires in the streets, would have a tendency to purify the air, and arrest the progress of the disorder. The people had, therefore, almost every night large fires lighted at the corners of the streets. The 29th, the mayor published a proclamation, forbidding this practice. As a substitute, many had recourse to the firing of guns, which they imagined was a certain preventative of the dis∣order. This was carried so far, and attended with such danger, that it was forbidden by the mayor's order, of the 4th of September.</P>
<P>The number of the infected daily increasing,
<PB N="24" REF="025255_0020_0FCCED5EEFAD0460"/>
and the existence of an order against the admis∣sion of persons labouring under infectious dis∣eases into the alms house, precluding them from a refuge there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this period, the number of paupers in the alms house was between three and four hundred; and the ma∣nagers, apprehensive of spreading the disorder among them, enforced the abovementioned order, which had been entered into along time before. They, however, sup∣plied beds and bedding, and all the money in their trea∣sury, for their relief, out of that house.</NOTE>, some temporary place was re∣quisite, and thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the guardians of the poor took possession of the circus, in which mr. Ric∣ketts had lately exhibited his equestrian feats, being the only place that could be procured for the purpose. Thither they sent seven persons afflicted with the malignant fever, where they lay in the open air for some time, and without proper assistance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">High wages were offered for nurses for these poor people—but none could be procured.</NOTE>. Of these, one crawled out on the commons, where he died at a distance from any house. Two died in the circus, one of whom was seasonably removed; the other lay in a state of putrefaction for above forty eight hours, owing to the difficulty of procuring any person
<PB N="25" REF="025255_0021_0FCCED60618377C0"/>
to remove him. On this occasion occurred an instance of courage in a servant girl, of which at that time few men were capable. The carter, who finally undertook to remove the corpse, having no assistant, and being unable alone to put it into the coffin, was on the point of relin∣quishing his design, and quitting the place. The girl perceived him, and understanding the dif∣ficulty he laboured under, offered her services, provided he would not inform the family with whom she lived. She accordingly helped him to put the body into the coffin, which was by that time crawling with maggots, and in such a state as to be ready to fall in pieces. It gives me plea∣sure to add, that she still lives, notwithstanding her very hazardous exploit.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the neighbourhood of the circus took the alarm, and theatened to burn or destroy it, unless the sick were removed; and it is believed they would have actually carried their threats into execution, had a compliance been delayed a day longer.</P>
<P>The 29th, seven of the guardians of the poor had a conference with some of the city magis∣trates
<PB N="26" REF="025255_0022_0FCCED620BB5E108"/>
on the subject of the fever, at which it was agreed to be indispensably necessary that a suitable house, as an hospital, should be provided near the city for the reception of the infected poor.</P>
<P>In consequence, the same day, the guardians of the poor resolved to use their utmost exer∣tions to procure such a house out of town, and as near thereto, as might be practicable, consist∣ent with the safety of the inhabitants, for the poor who were or might be afflicted with conta∣gious disorders, and be destitute of the means of providing necessary assistance otherwise; to en∣gage physicians, nurses, attendants, and all ne∣cessaries for their relief in that house; to ap∣point proper persons in each district, to enquire after such poor as might be afflicted; to adminis∣ter assistance to them in their own houses, and, if necessary, to remove them to the hospital. They reserved to themselves, at the same time, the liberty of calling on the mayor for such sums as might be necessary to carry their re∣solves into effect.</P>
<P>Conformably to these resolves, a committee of
<PB N="27" REF="025255_0023_0FCCED6370BFA510"/>
the guardians was appointed to make enquiry for a suitable place; and after strict examina∣tion, they judged that a building adjacent to Bushhill, the mansion house of William Hamil∣ton, esq. was the best calculated for the pur∣pose. And that gentleman being absent, and having no agent in the city, and the great ur∣gency of the case admitting no delay, eight of the guardians, accompanied by Hilary Baker, esq. one of the city aldermen, with the concur∣rence of the governor, proceeded to the build∣ing they had fixed upon; and meeting with some opposition from a tenant who occupied it, they took possession of the mansion house itself, to which, on the same evening, the 31st of Au∣gust, they sent the four patients who remained at the circus.</P>
<P>Shortly after this, the guardians of the poor for the city, except James Wilson, Jacob Tom∣kins, jun. and William Sansom, ceased the performance of their duties, nearly the whole of them having removed out of the city. Before this virtual vacation of office, they passed a re∣solve against the admission of any paupers what∣ever into the alms-house during the prevalence
<PB N="28" REF="025255_0024_0FCCED64DF528630"/>
of the disorder. The cause of entering into this order, was, that some paupers, who had been admitted previous thereto, with a certificate from the physicians, of their being free from the infection, had nevertheless died of it. The whole care of the poor of the city, the providing for Bush-hill, sending the sick there, and burying the dead, devolved, therefore, on the above three guardians. It must give the reader great sorrow to hear, that two of them, James Wil∣son, and Jacob Tomkins, excellent and indefati∣gable young men, whose services were at that time of very great importance, fell sacrifices in the cause of humanity. The other, William San∣som, was likewise, in the execution of his dange∣rous office, seized with the disorder, and on the brink of the grave, but was so fortunate as to escape.</P>
<P>The consternation of the people of Philadel∣phia at this period was carried beyond all bounds. Dismay and affright were visible in the countenance of almost every person. Most peo∣ple who could by any means make it convenient, fled from the city. Of those who remained, ma∣ny shut themselves up in their houses, and were
<PB N="29" REF="025255_0025_0FCCED66642259D8"/>
afraid to walk the streets. The consumption of gunpowder and nitre in houses as a preventa∣tive, was inconceivable. Many were almost in∣cessantly purifying, scowering, and whitewash∣ing their rooms. Those who ventured abroad, had handkerchiefs or sponges impregnated with vinegar or camphor, at their noses, or else smel∣ling bottles with the thieves' vinegar. Others carried pieces of tar in their hands, or pockets, or camphor bags tied round their necks. The corpses of the most respectable citizens, even of those who did not die of the epidemic, were carried to the grave, on the shafts of a chair, the horse driven by a negro, unattended by a friend or relation, and without any sort of ce∣remony. People shifted their course at the sight of a hearse coming towards them. Many never walked on the foot path, but went into the middle of the streets, to avoid being infected in passing by houses wherein people had died. Ac∣quaintances and friends avoided each other in the streets, and only signified their regard by a cold nod. The old custom of shaking hands fell into such general disuse, that many were affront∣ed at even the offer of the hand. A person with a crape, or any appearance of mourning, was
<PB N="30" REF="025255_0026_0FCCED6D389A4BA0"/>
shunned like a viper. And many valued them∣selves highly on the skill and address with which they got to windward of every person they met. Indeed it is not probable that London, at the last stage of the plague, exhibited stronger marks of terror, than were to be seen in Philadelphia, from the 24th or 25th of August till pretty late in September. When people summoned up resolution to walk abroad, and take the air, the sick cart conveying patients to the hospital, or the hearse carrying the dead to the grave, which were travelling almost the whole day, soon damped their spirits, and plunged them a∣gain into despondency.</P>
<P>While affairs were in this deplorable state, and the people at the lowest ebb of despair, we cannot be astonished at the frightful scenes that were acted, which seemed to indicate a total dis∣solution of the bonds of society in the nearest and dearest connexions. Who, without horror, can reflect on a husband deserting his wife, united to him perhaps for twenty years, in the last agony—a wife unfeelingly abandoning her husband on his death bed—parents forsaking their only children without remorse—children
<PB N="31" REF="025255_0027_0FCCED6EDDBBF040"/>
ungratefully flying from their parents, and re∣signing them to chance, without an enquiry after their health or safety—masters hurrying off their faithful servants to Bushhill, even on suspicion of the fever, and that at a time, when, like Tartarus, it was open to every visitant, but never returned any—servants abandoning ten∣der and humane masters, who only wanted a little care to restore them to health and useful∣ness—who, I say, can even now think of these things without horror? Yet such were daily exhibited in every quarter of our city.</P>
<P>These desertions produced scenes of distress and misery, of which few parallels are to be met with, and which nothing could palliate, but the extraordinary public panic, and the great law of self preservation, the dominion of which ex∣tends over the whole animated world. Many men of affluent fortunes, who have given em∣ployment and sustenance to hundreds every day in the year, have been abandoned to the care of a negro, after their wives, children, friends, clerks, and servants had fled away, and left them to their fate. In many cases, no money could procure proper attendance. With the
<PB N="32" REF="025255_0028_0FCCED7146A8BA28"/>
poor, the case was, as might be expected, infi∣nitely worse than with the rich. Many of these have perished, without a human being to hand them a drink of water, to administer medicines, or to perform any charitable office for them. Various instances have occurred of dead bodies found lying in the streets, of persons who had no house or habitation, and could procure no shelter.</P>
<P>A woman, whose husband had just died of the fever, was seized with the pains of labour, and had nobody to assist her, as the women in the neighbourhood were afraid to go into the house. She lay for a considerable time in a de∣gree of anguish that will not bear description. At length, she struggled to reach the window, and cried out for assistance. Two men, passing by, went up stairs; but they came at too late a stage.—She was striving with death—and ac∣tually in a few minutes expired in their arms.</P>
<P>A woman, whose husband and two children lay dead in the room with her, was in the same situation, without a midwife, or any other person to aid her. Her cries at the window brought up one of the carters employed by the committee
<PB N="33" REF="025255_0029_0FCCED726ED2C548"/>
for the relief of the sick. With his assistance, she was delivered of a child, which died in a few minutes, as did the mother, who was utterly exhausted by her labour, by the disorder, and by the dreadful spectacle before her. And thus lay in one room, no less than five dead bodies, an entire family, carried off in an hour or two. Many instances have occurred, of respectable women, who, in their lying-in, have been oblig∣ed to depend on servant women for assistance —and some have had none but their husbands. Some of the midwives were dead—and others had left the city.</P>
<P>A servant girl, belonging to a family in this city, in which the fever had prevailed, was ap∣prehensive of danger, and resolved to remove to a relation's house, in the country. She was, however, taken sick on the road, and returned to town, where she could find no person to receive her. One of the guardians of the poor provided a cart, and took her to the alms house, into which she was refused admittance. She was brought back, and the guardian offered five dol∣lars to provide her a single night's lodging, but in vain. And in fine, after every effort made to
<PB N="34" REF="025255_0030_0FCCED73E3C4BD00"/>
provide her shelter, she absolutely expired in the cart.</P>
<P>To relate all the frightful cases of this nature that occurred, would fill a volume. Let these few suffice. But I must observe, that most of them happened in the first stage of the public panic. Afterwards, when the citizens recovered a little from their fright, they became rare.</P>
<P>Great as was the calamity of Philadelphia, it was magnified in the most extraordinary man∣ner. The hundred tongues of rumour were never more successfully employed, than on this melancholy occasion. The terror of the inhabi∣tants of all the neighbouring states was excited by a succession of letters from Philadelphia, dis∣tributed by every mail, which told tales of woe, whereof hardly a single circumstance was true, but which were every where received with impli∣cit faith. The distresses of the city, and the fata∣lity of the disorder, were exaggerated as it were to see how far credulity could be carried. The plague of London was, according to ru∣mour, hardly more fatal than our yellow fever. Our citizens died so fast, that there was hardly
<PB N="35" REF="025255_0031_0FCCED7589946098"/>
enough of people to bury them.

<P><Q>It is now a very mortal time in this city. The yellow fever hath killed <HI>some thousands</HI> of the inhabitants. Eight thousand mechanics, besides other people, have left the town. Every master in the city, of our branch of business, is gone.</Q>
The <HI>"some thousands"</HI> that were killed at that time did not amount to three hundred. The <HI>authentic</HI> information in this letter, was circulated in every state in the union, by the news paper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
</LETTER></NOTE>. And the nature and danger of the disorder, were as much misrepre∣sented, as the number of the dead. It was said, in defiance of every day's experience, to be as inevitable by all exposed to the contagion, as the stroke of fate.</P>
<P>The effects produced by these letters, were such as might be reasonably expected. The con∣sternation spread though the several states like wild-fire. The first public act that took place on the subject, as far as I can learn, was at Chester∣town, in Maryland. At this place, a meeting was held on the 10th of September, at which several resolves were entered into, which, after specify∣ing
<PB N="38" REF="025255_0034_0FCCED7C755FC9B0"/>
that the disorder had extended to Trenton, Princeton, Woodbridge, and Elizabeth-town, on the post road to New York, directed, that notice should be sent to the owners of the stages not to allow them to pass through the town, while there should be reason to expect danger therefrom; that a committee of health and in∣spection should be appointed, to provide for the relief of such poor inhabitants as might take the disorder, and likewise for such strangers as might be infected with it. They at the same ap∣pointed seven persons as this committee, with power to call a general meeting in par∣ticular specified cases. In consequence of these resolves, the Eastern shore line of stages was stopt in the course of a few days afterwards.</P>
<P>The alarm in New York was first officially announced by a letter from the mayor to the practising physicians, dated Sept. 11, in which he requests them to report to him in writing the names of all such persons as had arrived, or should arrive from Philadelphia, or any other place, by land or water, and were or should be sick; that such as should be deemed subjects of
<PB N="39" REF="025255_0035_0FCCED7E5AACA8B8"/>
infectious diseases, might be removed out of the city. He notified them, that the corporation had taken measures to provide a proper place for an hospital, for such persons as might un∣happily become subjects of the fever in New York. In this letter the mayor declared his opi∣nion clearly, that the intercourse with Philadel∣phia, could not be lawfully interrupted by any power in the state. The 12th appeared a procla∣mation from governor Clinton, which, refer∣ring to the
<Q>act to prevent the bringing in, and spreading of infectious disorders,</Q>
prohibited, in the terms of that act, all vessels from Phila∣delphia, to approach nearer to the city of New York, then Bedlow's island, about two miles distant, till duly discharged. The silence of this proclamation, respecting passengers by land, seemed to imply that the governor's opinion on the subject, was the same as that of the mayor.</P>
<P>The same day, at a meeting of the citizens, the necessity of taking some precautions was unanimously agreed upon, and a committee of seven appointed to report a plan to a meet∣ing to be held next day. Their report, which was unanimously agreed to, the 13th, recom∣mended
<PB N="40" REF="025255_0036_0FCCED7FE41FC998"/>
to hire two physicians, to assist the physician of the port in his examinations of vessels; to check, as much as possible, the inter∣course by stages; to acquaint the proprietors of the southern stages, that it was the earnest wish of the inhabitants, that their carriages and boats should not pass during the prevalence of the disorder in Philadelphia; and to request the practitioners of physic to report, without fail, every case of fever, to which they might be called, occurring in any persons that had or might arrive from Philadelphia, or have inter∣course with them. Not satisfied with these mea∣sures, the corporation, on the 17th, came to a resolution to stop all intercourse between the two cities; and for this purpose guards were placed at the different landings, with orders to send back every person coming from Philadel∣phia; and if any were discovered to have arrived after that date, they were to be directly sent back. All persons taking in lodg∣ers, were called upon to give information of all people of the above description, under pain of being prosecuted according to law. All good citizens were required to give information to the mayor, or any member of the committee, of any breach in the premises.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="025255_0037_0FCCED815D65DD18"/>All these strict precautions being eluded by the fears and the vigilance of the fugitives from Philadelphia, on the 23d there was a meeting held, of delegates from the several wards of the city, in order to adopt more effectual measures. At this meeting, it was resolved to establish a night watch of not less than ten citizens in each ward, to guard against such as might escape them by day. Not yet eased of their fears, they next day published an address, in which they mentioned, that notwithstanding their utmost vigilance, many persons had been clandestinely landed upon the shores of New York island. They therefore again called upon their fellow citizens to be cautious how they received strangers into their houses; not to fail to report all such to the mayor immediately upon their arrival; to remember the importance of the occasion; and to consider what reply they should make to the just resentment of their fellow citizens, whose lives they might expose by a criminal neglect, or infidelity. They likewise declared their ex∣pectation, that those who kept the different ferries on the shores of New Jersey and Staten island, would pay such attention to their ad∣dress, as not to transport any person but to the
<PB N="42" REF="025255_0038_0FCCED83DEF9EA98"/>
public landings, and that in the day time, be∣tween sun and sun. The 30th they published a lengthy address, recapitulating the various pre∣cautions they had taken—the nature of the disorder—and the numbers who had died out of Philadelphia, without communicating it to any one. They at the same time resolved, that goods, bedding, and clothing, packed up in Philadelphia, should, previous to their being brought into New York, be unpacked and ex∣posed to the open air in some well-ventilated place, for at least 48 hours; that all linen or cotton clothes, or bedding, which had been used, should be well washed in several waters; and af∣terwards, that the whole, both such as had been, and such as had not been used, should be hung up in a close room, and well smoked with the fumes of brimstone for one day, and after that again exposed for at least twenty four hours to the open air; and that the boxes, trunks, or chests, in which they had been packed, should be cleaned and aired in the same manner; after which, being repacked, and such evidence given of their purification, as the committee should re∣quire, permission might be had to bring them into the city.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="025255_0039_0FCCED85A8A9FD08"/>The 11th of October, they likewise resolved, that they would consider and publish to the world, as enemies to the welfare of the city, and the lives of its inhabitants, all those who should be so selfish and hardy, as to attempt to intro∣troduce any goods, wares, merchandize, bed∣ding, baggage, &amp;c. imported from, or packed up in Philadelphia, contrary to the rules prescribed by that body, who were, they said, deputed to express the will of their fellow citizens. They recommended to the inhabitants to withstand any temptation of profit, which might attend the purchase of goods in Philadel∣phia, as no emolument to an individual, they added, could warrant the hazard to which such conduct might expose the city. Besides all these resolves, they published daily statements of the health of the city, to allay the fears of their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣low citizens.</P>
<P>I did not choose to interrupt this account of the proceedings of the committee of health, to mention, in order of time, that the clergy of New York had a meeting, on the 16th of Sep∣tember, and unanimously agreed to set apart Friday, the 20th, as a day of humiliation, fast∣ing,
<PB N="44" REF="025255_0040_0FCCED86AA14BC50"/>
and prayer to Almighty God, for the pre∣servation of their city, from the fever, and for the comfort and support of their brethren in Philadelphia, in the season of their distress. The Dutch synod of New York had a meeting the first week in October, at which they agreed that those churches under their care, which had not yet observed a day of fast and prayer, should devote the second Wednesday in November to that purpose.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Trenton and Lamberton as∣sociated on the 13th of Sept. and on the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th passed several resolutions to guard themselves against the contagion. They resolved that a total stop should be put to the landing of all persons from Philadelphia, at any ferry or place from Lamberton to Howell's ferry, four miles above Trenton; that the intercourse by water should be prohibited between Lamberton, or the head of tide water, and Philadelphia; and that all boats from Philadelphia, should be prevented from land∣ing either goods or passengers any where between Bordentown and the head of tide water; that no person whatever should be permi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted to come from Philadelphia, or Kensington, while the fe∣ver
<PB N="45" REF="025255_0041_0FCCED881E45A628"/>
continued; that all persons who should go from within the limits of the association, to ei∣ther of those places, should be prevented from returning during the continuance of the fever; and finally, that their standing committee should enquire whether any persons, not inhabitants, who had lately come from places infected, and were therefore likely to be infected themselves, were within the limits of the association, and if so, that they should be obliged instantly to leave the said limits. The people of Jersey observed the 1st of October, as a day of fast and prayer, for the same purpose as those of New York.</P>
<P>The 12th of September, the governor of Ma∣ryland published a proclamation, subjecting all vessels from Philadelphia to the performance of a quarantine, not exceeding forty days, or as much less as might be judged safe by the health officers. It further ordered, that all per∣sons going to Baltimore, to Havre de Grace, to the head of Elk, or, by any other route, making their way into that state from Phila∣delphia, or any other place known to be infect∣ed with the malignant fever, should be subject to be examined, and prevented from proceed∣ing,
<PB N="46" REF="025255_0042_0FCCED89AC97AE10"/>
by persons to be appointed for that pur∣pose, and who were to take the advice and opinion of the medical faculty in every case, in order that private affairs and pursuits might not be unnecessarily impeded. This proclama∣tion appointed two health officers for Balti∣more.</P>
<P>The people of Baltimore met the 13th of September, and resolved that none of their ci∣tizens should receive into their houses any per∣sons coming from Philadelphia, or other in∣fected place, without producing a certificate from the health officer, or officer of patrol; and that any person who violated that resolve, should be held up to public view, as a proper object for the resentment of the town. The 14th, a party of militia was dispatched to take possession of a pass on the Philadelphia road, about two miles from Baltimore, to prevent the entrance of any passengers from Philadelphia without license. Dr. Worthington, the health officer stationed at this pass, was directed to re∣fuse permission to persons afflicted with any malignant complaint, or who had not been ab∣sent from Philadelphia, or other infected place,
<PB N="47" REF="025255_0043_0FCCED8BC16DF780"/>
at least seven days. The western shore line of Philadelphia stages was stopped about the 18th or 19th.</P>
<P>The 30th, the committee of health resolved that no inhabitant of Baltimore, who should visit persons from Philadelphia, while perform∣ing quarantine, should be permitted to enter the town, until the time of quarantine was ex∣pired, and until it was certainly known that the persons he had visited were free from the infec∣tion; and that thenceforward no goods capable of conveying infection, that had been landed or packed up in Philadelphia, or other infected place, should be permitted to enter the town— nor should any baggage of travellers be admit∣ted, until it had been exposed to the open air such length of time as the health officer might direct.</P>
<P>The 25th of September, the inhabitants of Havre de Grace, resolved that no person should be allowed to cross the Susquehannah river at that place, who did not bring a certificate of his not having lately come from Philadelphia, or any other infected place; and that the citizens of
<PB N="48" REF="025255_0044_0FCCED8D9FCD76D8"/>
Havre would embody themselves to prevent any one from crossing without such a certificate.</P>
<P>At Hagerstown, on the 3d of October, it was resolved, that no citizen should receive into his house any person coming from Philadelphia, supposed to be infected with the malignant fe∣ver, until he or she produced a certificate from a health officer; that should any citizen contra∣vene the above resolution, he should be cut off from all society with his fellow citizens; that the clothing sent to the troops then in that town, should not be received there, nor suffered to come within seven miles thereof; that if any person from Philadelphia, or other infected place, should arrive there, he should be required instantly to depart, and in case of refusal or ne∣glect, be compelled to go without delay; that no merchant, or other person, should be permit∣ted to bring into the town, or open therein, any goods brought from Philadelphia, or other infected place, until permitted by the com∣mittee; and that the citizens of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he town, and its vicinity, should enrol themselves as a guard, and patrole such road and passes as the commit∣tee should direct.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="025255_0045_0FCCED8F01C42600"/>The governor of Virginia, on the 17th of September, issued a proclamation, ordering all vessels from Philadelphia, the Grenades, and the island of Tobago, to perform a quarantine of twenty days, at the anchorage ground, off Cra∣ney island, near the mouth of Elizabeth river.</P>
<P>The corporation of Alexandria stationed a look-out boat, to prevent all vessels bound to that port, from approaching nearer than one mile, until after examination by the health of∣ficer.</P>
<P>The people of Winchester placed guards at every avenue of the town leading from the Pa∣tomac, to stop all suspected persons, packages, &amp;c. coming from Philadelphia till the health officers should inspect them, and either forbid or allow them to pass.</P>
<P>The legislature of Massachusetts happened to be actually in session, at the time the alarm spread; and they accordingly passed an express act for guarding against the impending danger. This act directed that the selectmen in the dif∣ferent towns should be authorised to stop and
<PB N="50" REF="025255_0046_0FCCED9200DC8908"/>
examine any persons, baggage, merchandize, or effects, coming, or supposed to be com∣ing into the towns respectively, from Philadel∣phia, or other place infected, or supposed to be infected; and should it appear to them, or to any officers whom they should appoint, that any danger of infection was to be apprehended from such persons, effects, baggage, or mer∣chandize, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey were authorised to detain or remove the same to such place as they might see proper, in order that they might be puri∣fied from infection; or to place any persons so coming, in such places, and under such regu∣lations as they might judge necessary for the public safety. In pursuance of this act, the go∣vernor issued a proclamation to carry it into ef∣fect, the 21st of September.</P>
<P>The selectmen of Boston, on the 24th, pub∣lished their regulations of quarantine, which ordered, that on the arrival of any vessel from Philadelphia, she should be detained at, or near Rainsford's Island, to perform a quarantine not exceeding thirty days, during which time she should be cleansed with vinegar, and the ex∣plosion of gunpowder between the decks and
<PB N="51" REF="025255_0047_0FCCED935A916828"/>
in the cabin, even though there were no sick persons on board; that in case there should be sick on board, they should be removed to an hospital, where they should be detained till they recovered, or were long enough to ascer∣tain that they had not the infection; that every vessel, performing quarantine, should be de∣prived of its boat, and no boat suffered to ap∣proach it, but by special permission; that if any person should escape, he should be instantly ad∣vertised, in order that he might be apprehended; that any persons coming by land from Philadel∣phia, should not be allowed to enter Boston, until twenty one days after their arrival, and their effects, baggage, and merchandize should be opened, washed, and fumigated with vinegar and repeated explosions of gunpowder. In the conclusion, the selectmen called upon the inha∣bitants to use their utmost vigilance and activity to bring to condign punishment any person who should be so daring and lost to every idea of humanity, as to come into the town from any place supposed to be infected, thereby endanger∣ing the lives of their fellow men.</P>
<P>The governor of Rhode Island, the 21st of
<PB N="52" REF="025255_0048_0FCCED95EFE15EB8"/>
September, issued a proclamation, directing the town councils and other officers, to use their utmost vigilance to cause the law to prevent the spreading of contagious disorders to be most strictly executed, more especially with respect to all vessels which should arrive in that state from the West Indies, Philadelphia, and New-York; the extension to the latter place was ow∣ing to the danger apprehended from the inter∣course between it and Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The 28th of September, the governor of North Carolina published his proclamation, re∣quiring the commissioners of navigation in the different ports, and the commissioners of the different towns in the said state, to appoint cer∣tain places, where all vessels from the port of Philadelphia, or any other place where the ma∣lignant fever might prevail, should perform quarantine for such number of days as they might think proper.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Charleston do not seem to have been far behind their neighbours in their apprehensions or their cautions. The 8th of Oct. they had a meeting, at which they resolved,
<PB N="53" REF="025255_0049_0FCCED980F94A5C0"/>
that no vessel from the river Delaware, either directly or after having touched at any other port of the united states, should be permitted to pass Charleston bar, till the citizens have again assembled, and declared themselves satisfi∣ed that the disorder has ceased in Philadelphia. If any vessel, contrary thereto, should cross the bar, his excellency should be requested to com∣pel it to quit the port, and return to sea. Be∣fore this meeting, vessels from Philadelphia had been obliged to perform quarantine; but by what regulation, I cannot ascertain.</P>
<P>The governor of Georgia, on the 4th of October, published a proclamation, ordering all vessels from Philadelphia, which should arrive in Savannah river, to remain in Tybee creek, or in other parts at like distance from the town, until the health officer of the port should, on examination, certify, that no malignant or con∣tagious disease was on board. All persons con∣travening this proclamation, were to be prose∣cuted, and subjected to the pains and penalties by law pointed out.</P>
<P>The people of Augusta, in that state, were
<PB N="54" REF="025255_0050_0FCCED9960199EF0"/>
as active and vigilant as their northern neigh∣bours, to guard against the threatening dangers.</P>
<P>While our citizens were thus prescribed in se∣veral cities and towns—hunted up like felons in some—and debarred admittance and turned back in others, whether sound or infected—it is with extreme satisfaction I have to record a conduct totally different, which cannot fail to make an indelible impression on the minds of the people of Philadelphia, and call forth the most lively emotions of gratitude.</P>
<P>A respectable number of the inhabitants of Springfield, in New Jersey, met the first day of October, and after a full consideration of the distresses of our citizens, passed a resolve, offer∣ing their town as an asylum to the people flying from Philadelphia, and directing their commit∣tee to provide a suitable place as an hospital for such of them as might be seized with the pre∣vailing malignant fever.</P>
<P>I have been informed, by a person of credit, that the inhabitants of Elizabeth town have pursued the same liberal pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as those of Springfield; but have not been able to procure
<PB N="55" REF="025255_0051_0FCCED9AE1B65F00"/>
a copy of their resolves or proceedings on the subject.</P>
<P>An asylum has likewise been offered to Phila∣delphians, by several of the inhabitants of Elk∣ton, in Maryland; and the offer was couched in terms of the utmost sympathy for our suf∣ferings.</P>
<P>The instances of this kind, through this ex∣tensive country, have been very few; but they are therefore only the more precious, and ought to be held up to public approbation. May they operate on people, at a future day, in similar cases of dreadful calamity—and teach them to temper their caution with as much humanity and tenderness to the distressed fugitives, as prudence will allow—and not in∣volve in one indiscriminate proscription the healthy and infected.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the situation of affairs in Philadelphia, became daily more and more seri∣ous. The three guardians of the poor for the city, who, as I have said, continued to act, were quite oppressed with the labours of their office, which increased to such a degree, that they
<PB N="56" REF="025255_0052_0FCCED9E070178E8"/>
were utterly unable to execute them. The num∣ber of diseased persons became very great. Owing to the general terror, nurses, carters, and attendants could hardly be procured. Thus circumstanced, the mayor of the city, on the 10th of September, published an address to the citizens, announcing that the guardians of the poor, who remained, were in distress for want of assistance, and inviting such benevolent citi∣zens as felt for the general distress, to lend their aid. In consequence of this advertisement, a meeting of the citizens was held at the city hall, on the 12th of September, at which very few attended, from the univeral consternation that prevailed. The state of the poor was fully considered; and ten citizens, Israel Israel, Sa∣muel Wetherill, Thomas Wistar, Andrew Ad∣gate, Caleb Lownes, Henry Deforest, Thomas Peters, Joseph Inskeep, Stephen Gerard, and John Mason, offered themselves to assist the guardians of the poor. At this meeting, a com∣mittee was appointed to confer with the physi∣cians who had the care of Bush-hill. This committee reported next evening, that the hospital was in very bad order, and in want of almost every thing.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="025255_0053_0FCCED9F5DBFD840"/>The 14th, another meeting was held, when the urgent necessities of the sick being fully conside∣dered, it was resolved to borrow 1500 dollars of the bank of North America, for the purpose of procuring suitable accommodations for the use of persons afflicted with the prevailing malig∣nant fever. At this meeting, a committee was appointed to transact the whole of the business relative to the relief of the sick, and the procu∣ring of physicians, nurses, attendants, &amp;c. This is the committee, which, by virtue of that ap∣pointment, has from that day to the present time, watched over the sick, the poor, they wi∣dow, and the orphan. It is worthy of remark, and may encourage others in times of public ca∣lamity, that this committee consisted originally of only twenty-six persons, men taken from the middle walks of life, and of the moderate pitch of abilities; of these, four, Andrew Ad∣gate, Jonathan Dickinson Sargeant, Daniel Of∣fley, and Joseph Inskeep, died, the two first at an early period of their labours—and four ne∣ver attended to the appointment. "The heat and burden of the day" have therefore been borne by eighteen persons, whose exertions have been so highly favoured by providence, that
<PB N="58" REF="025255_0054_0FCCEDA26E442978"/>
they have been the instruments of averting the progress of destruction, eminently relieving the distressed, and restoring confidence to the ter∣rified inhabitants of Philadelphia. It is honoura∣ble to this committee, that from the time of their organization to the present, they have li∣ved together in more harmony than is generally to be met with in public bodies of equal num∣ber.</P>
<P>Never, perhaps, was there a city in the situ∣ation of Philadelphia at this period. The presi∣dent of the united states, according to his an∣nual custom, had removed to Mount Vernon, with his household. Most, if not all of the other officers of the federal government were absent. The governor, who had been sick, had gone, by directions of his physician, to his coun∣try seat near the talls of Schuylkill—and nearly the whole of the officers of the state had likewise retired.—The magistrates of the city, except the mayor, were away, as were most of those of the liberties. Of the situation of the guardians of the poor I have already made mention. In fact, government of every kind was almost wholly vacated, and by universal consent vested in the committee.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="025255_0055_0FCCEDA41A352AE0"/>On the 15th, the committee resolved, that three members of their board should attend daily at the city hall, to receive applications for relief, to provide for the burial of the dead, and the conveyance to Bushhill of all persons la∣bouring under the fever, who might be willing to go there. This order was soon rescinded, it being found necessary for all the members to at∣tend at the hall.</P>
<P>This day, a circumstance occurred, to which the most glowing pencil could hardly do justice. Stephen Girard, a wealthy merchant, a native of France, touched with the wretched situation of the sufferers at Bush hill, voluntarily and unex∣pectedly offered to superintend that hospital. The surprise and satisfaction, excited by this extraor∣dinary effort of humanity, can be better con∣ceived than expressed. Peter Helm, a native of Pennsylvania, actuated by the like benevolent motives, offered his services in the same depart∣ment. Their offers were accepted, and the same afternoon they entered on the execution of their dangerous and praiseworthy office.</P>
<P>To form a just estimate of the value of the offer of these men, it is necessary to take into
<PB N="60" REF="025255_0056_0FCCEDA597C93008"/>
full consideration the general consternation, which at that period pervaded every quarter of the city, and which made attendance on the sick be regarded as little less than a certain sacrifice. Uninfluenced by any reflexions of this kind, with∣out any possible inducement but the purest motives of humanity, they came forward, and offered themselves as the forlorn hope of the committee. I trust that the gratitude of their fellow citizens will remain as long as the memory of their bene∣ficent conduct, which I hope will not die with the present generation. While I am on this subject, let me add, that from the time of undertaking this office to the present, they have attended un∣interruptedly, for six, seven or eight hours a day, renouncing almost every care of private affairs. They have had a most irksome tour of duty to perform—to encourage and comfort the sick—to hand them necessaries and medicines—to wipe the sweat off their brows—and to perform many disgusting offices of kindness for them, which nothing could render tolerable, but the exalted motives that impelled them to this heroic conduct.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the managers of Bushhill, after
<PB N="61" REF="025255_0057_0FCCEDA6D924D808"/>
personal inspection of the state of affairs there, made report of its situation, which was truly deplorable. It exhibited as wretched a picture of human misery as ever existed. A profligate, abandoned set of nurses and attendants (hardly any of good character could at that time be procured,) rioted on the provisions and com∣forts, prepared for the sick, who (unless at the hours when the doctors attended) were left al∣most entirely destitute of every assistance. The dying and dead were indiscriminately mingled together. The ordure and other evacuations of the sick, were allowed to remain in the most offensive state imaginable. Not the smallest ap∣pearance of order or regularity existed. It was, in fact, a great human slaughter house, where numerous victims were immolated at the altar of riot and intemperance. No wonder, then, that a general dread of the place prevailed through the city, and that a removal to it was considered as the seal of death. In consequence, there were various instances of sick persons locking their rooms, and resisting every attempt to carry them away. At length, the poor were so much afraid of being sent to Bushhill, that they would not acknowledge their illness, until
<PB N="62" REF="025255_0058_0FCCEDA85E9DFB70"/>
it was no longer possible to conceal it. For it is to be observed, that the fear of the contagion was so prevalent, that as soon as any one was taken sick, an alarm was spread among the neighbours, and every effort was used to have the sick person hurried off to Bushhill, to avoid spreading the disorder. The cases of the per∣sons forced in this way to that hospital, though labouring under only common colds, and common fall fevers, are numerous and af∣flicting. There were not wanting instances of persons, only slightly ill, being sent to Bushhill, by their panic-struck neighbours, and embra∣cing the first opportunity of running back to Philadelphia. But the case was soon altered un∣der the direction of the two managers, Girard and Helm. They introduced such order and regularity, and had the patients treated with so much care and tenderness, that they retrieved the character of the hospital; and in the course of a week or two, numbers of sick people, who had not at home proper persons to nurse them, applied to be sent to Bushhill. Indeed, in the end, so many people, who were afflicted with other disorders, procured admittance there, that it be∣come necessary to pass a resolve, that before an
<PB N="63" REF="025255_0059_0FCCEDA9DB99EB00"/>
order of admission should be granted, a certifi∣cate must be produced from a physician, that the patient laboured under the malignant fever.</P>
<P>The committee sat daily at the city hall, and engaged a number of carts to convey the dead to a place of interment, and the sick to the hos∣pital. From their organization to the present time, they have most unremittingly attended to the discharge of the trust reposed in them. Neither the regular increase of deaths till to∣wards the middle of October, nor the afflicting loss of four very active members, in quick suc∣cession, appalled them. That the mortality would have been incomparably greater, but for their active interposition, is beyond doubt; as most of those who went to Bushhill, and died there, would have otherwise died in the city, and spread the contagion: and the dead bodies would have remained putrifying in deserted houses in every part of the city, and operated as dreadfully as the plague itself. In fact, at the time they entered on the execution of the dan∣gerous office they undertook, there were found several bodies that had lain in this state for two, three, and four days.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="025255_0060_0FCCEDAB61BFDCB0"/>In the progress of the disorder, the committee found the calls on their humanity increase. The numerous deaths of heads of families l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft a very large body of children in a most abandon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, for∣lorn state. The bettering house, in which such helpless objects have been usually placed hereto∣fore, was barred against them, by the order which I have already mentioned. Many of these little innocents were actually suffering for want of even common necessaries. The deaths of their parents and protectors, which should have been the strongest recommendation to public charity, was the very reason of their distress, and of their being shunned as a pestilence. The children of a family once in easy circumstances, were found in a blacksmith's shop, squalid, dirty, and half starved, having been for a considerable time without even bread to eat. Various instances of a similar nature occurred. This evil early caught the attention of the committee▪ and on the 19th of September, they hired a house in Fifth-street, in which they placed thirteen children. The number increasing, on the 3d of October, they procured the Loganian library, which was ge∣nerously given up by John Swanwick, Esq. for the purpose of an orphan house. A further in∣crease
<PB N="65" REF="025255_0061_0FCCEDACDFE55FF0"/>
of their little charge, rendered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cessary to build some additions to the library, which are now finished, and are nearly half as large as that building. At present, there are in the house, un∣der the care of the orphan committee, above eighty children, and about forty are out with wet nurses. From the origin of the institution, one hundred and sixty children have fallen un∣der their care, of whom seven are dead, all of whom, except one, were sucking children; and about thirty have been delivered to their relati∣ons or friends. There are instances of five and six children of a single family in the house.</P>
<P>Another duty soon attracted the attention of the committee. The flight of so many of our ci∣tizens, the consequent stagnation of business, and the almost total cessation of the labours of the guardians of the poor, brought on among the lower classes of the people, a great degree of distress, which loudly demanded the interposi∣tion of the humane. In consequence, on the 20th of September, a sub-committee of distribu∣tion was appointed, to furnish such assistance to deserving objects as their respective cases might
<PB N="66" REF="025255_0062_0FCCEDAE6133C950"/>
require, and the funds allow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They had, in addition to the first loan from the bank of North America, borrowed 5000 dollars from the same institution, making in the whole 6500.</NOTE>. This was at first administered sparingly, owing to the confined state of their finances. But the very extraordi∣nary liberality of our fugitive fellow citizens, of the citizens of New York, and of those of va∣rious towns and townships, encouraged the committee to extend their views. And frequent impositions being attempted on them, they, on the 14th of October, called to their assistance a number of respectable characters in the different parts of the city and liberties, to seek out and give recommendations to deserving objects in distress. These gentlemen have undertaken this troublesome office, which they execute with so much circumspection, as to defeat the arts of impostors. At present, there are about twelve hundred people relieved weekly, most of whom have considerable families, some of four, six, and eight persons. The number, therefore, de∣pending on the committee for assistance, is pro∣bably above four thousand. The gradual revival
<PB N="67" REF="025255_0063_0FCCEDB04AD5DD60"/>
of business promises to rescue some of these peo∣ple speedily from the humiliation of a depen∣dence on public charity; and the organization of the guardians of the poor will make provisi∣on for the remainder.</P>
<P>From this time, the proceedings of the com∣mittee went on in a regular, uniform tenor, every day like the past, without any thing re∣markable occurring, worth recording. For above five weeks of the time they have been employ∣ed, the most dreary prospects appeared before them. The number of persons to be removed to Bushhill daily, was for a long time from twenty to thirty—and the number to be buried by their carters, was often equal. These two cir∣cumstances, the removals to the hospital, and the persons buried from the city-hall, were re∣garded as the barometer, by which to judge of the state of the disease; and in general they were a just one.</P>
<P>The week, beginning Sunday the 27th of October, proved for the most part cold and raw. Easterly winds generally prevailed. Thursday and Friday, there was a considerable fall of rain.
<PB N="68" REF="025255_0064_0FCCEDB1739638F8"/>
A visible alteration has already taken place in the state of affairs in the city. Our absent friends return in crowds. Every hour in the day, old faces appear—and in many instances, those of persons, whom public fame has buried for weeks past. The stores, so long closed, are opening fast. Some of the country merchants, bolder than others, are daily venturing in to their old place of supply. Market-street is nearly as full of wag∣gons as usual. The custom house, for weeks near∣ly deserted by our mercantile people, is throng∣ed by citizens entering their vessels and goods —the streets, too long the abode of gloom and despair, have assumed the bustle suitable to the season. The arrival in the city of our beloved president gives us a flattering prospect of the next session of congress being held here. And, in fine, as every thing, in the early stage of the disorder, seemed calculated to add to the general consternation; so now, on the contrary, every circumstance has a tendency to revive the courage and hopes of our citizens. But we have to lament, that the same spirit of exaggeration and lying, that prevailed at a for∣mer period, and was the grand cause of the harsh measures adopted by our sister states, has
<PB N="69" REF="025255_0065_0FCCEDB2DB50A148"/>
not ceased to operate; for at the present mo∣ment, when the danger is entirely done away, the credulous of our own citizens still absent, and of the country people, are still alarmed by frightful rumours, of the disorder raging with as much violence as ever; of numbers carried off, a few hours after their return; and of new cases daily occurring. To what design to attri∣bute these shameful tales, I know not. Were I to regard them in a spirit of resentment, I should be inclined to charge them to some secret, inter∣ested views of their authors, intent, if possible, to effect the entire destruction of our city. But I will not allow myself to consider them in this point of light—and will even suppose they arise from a proneness to terrific narration, natural to some men. But they should consider, that we are in the situation of the frogs in the fable— while these tales, which make the hair of the country people stand an end, are sport to the fa∣bricators, they are death to us. And I here assert, and defy contradiction, that of the whole num∣ber of our fugitive citizens, who have already returned, amounting to some thousands, not above two are dead—and these owe their fate to the most shameful neglect of airing and
<PB N="70" REF="025255_0066_0FCCEDB5EBA80E50"/>
cleansing their houses, notwithstanding the vari∣ous cautions published by the committee. If peo∣ple will venture into houses in which infected air has been pent up for weeks together without any purification, we cannot be surprized at the consequences, however fatal they may be. But let not the catastrophe of a few incautious per∣sons operate to bring discredit on a city contain∣ing above fifty thousand people.</P>
<P>At the time of writing these lines, the 10th of November, the committee look forward with pleasure to the moment of surrendering up their trust to a town meeting of their fellow citizens, the constituents by whom they were called into the extraordinary office they have filled. To them they will give an account of their stew∣ardship in a time of distress, the like of which heaven avert from the people of America for∣ever. They hope a candid construction will be put upon their conduct—and that it will be be∣lieved that they have acted in every case that has come under their cognizance, according to the best of their judgment.</P>
<P>The sympathy for our calamities displayed in
<PB N="71" REF="025255_0067_0FCCEDB835C050A0"/>
various places, reflects the highest honour on their inhabitants, and demands our warmest gratitude. The inhabitants of Gloucester county in New Jersey, have the honour of being first in this laudable race. So early as the 30th of September, they had a considerable sum collect∣ed, with which they purchased a quantity of provisions for the use of the hospital at Bush-hill. They have from that time regularly con∣tinued copious supplies twice a week. From a few citizens of Philadelphia, near Germantown, there have been received two thousand dollars; from others near Darby, fourteen hundred; from New York, five thousand; from a person unknown, five hundred; from Bucks' county sixteen hundred; from Delaware county twelve hundred; from Franklin county nearly five hun∣dred; from Boston sundry articles, estimated at twenty-five hundred; and from sundry other persons and places, contributions equally liberal and honourable.</P>
<P>The disorder raged with increased violence, as the season advanced towards the mild fall months. In the month of September, the mor∣tality was much greater than in August; and still greater in October, to the 25th, than in Sep∣tember.
<PB N="72" REF="025255_0068_0FCCEDBA4E3D37C8"/>
What is very particularly worthy of attention, is, that though all the hopes of the citizens rested on cold and rain, especially the latter, yet the disorder was extinguished with hardly any rain, and a very moderate degree of cold. The 26th may be set down as the day when the virulence of the fever expired. The deaths afterwards were few, and mostly of those long sick. Hardly any persons have since ta∣ken it. That day was as warm as many of the most fatal ones in the early part of the month. To account for this is perhaps above our power. In fact, the whole of the disorder, from its first appearance to its final close, has set human wis∣dom and calculation at defiance.</P>
<P>Rarely has it happened, that so large a pro∣portion of the gentlemen of the faculty have sunk beneath the labours of their very dange∣rous profession, as on this occasion. In little more than a month, exclusive of medical students, no less than ten physicians have been swept off, doc∣tors Hutchinson, Morris, Linn, Pennington, Dodds, Johnson, Glentworth, Phile, Graham, and Green. Hardly one of the practising doctors that remained in the city, escaped sickness— some were three, four, and five times confined.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="025255_0069_0FCCEDBB263D9CA0"/>To the clergy it has likewise proved very fatal. Exposed, in the exercise of the last duties to the dying, to equal danger with the physici∣ans, it is not surprising that so many of them have fallen. Their names are, the rev. Alexander Murray, of the protestant episcopal church—the rev. F. A. Fleming and the rev. Laurence Graessl of the Roman catholic—the rev. John Winkhause, of the German reformed—the rev. James Sproat, of the presbyterian—the rev. William Dougherty, of the methodist church— and three preachers of the Friends society, Da∣niel Offley, Huson Langstroth, and Charles Williams. Six clergymen have been in the greatest danger from this disorder, the rev. R. Blackwell, rev. Joseph Pilmore, rev. William Rogers, rev. Christopher V. Keating, rev. Fre∣deric Schmidt, and the rev. Joseph Turner; but they have all recovered.</P>
<P>Among the women, the mortality has not by any means been so great, as among the men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In many congregations, the deaths of men have been twice as numerous as those of women.</NOTE>,
<PB N="74" REF="025255_0070_0FCCEDBCCC91C9E8"/>
nor among the old and infirm as among the mid∣dle-aged and robust.</P>
<P>To tipplers and drunkards, and to men who lived high, and were of a corpulent habit of body, this disorder was very fatal. Of these, many were seized, and the recoveries were very rare.</P>
<P>To the <HI>filles de joie,</HI> it has been equally fatal. The wretched debilitated state of their constitu∣tions, rendered them an easy prey to this dread∣ful disorder, which very soon terminated their miserable career.</P>
<P>It has been dreadfully destructive among the poor. It is very probable, that at least seven eighths of the number of the dead, were of that class. The inhabitants of dirty houses have severely expiated their neglect of cleanli∣ness and decency, by the numbers of them that have fallen sacrifices. Whole families in such houses have sunk into one silent, undistinguish∣ing grave.</P>
<P>The mortality in confined streets, small al∣lies,
<PB N="75" REF="025255_0071_0FCCEDBEE3F7FE18"/>
and close houses, debarred of a free circu∣lation of air, has exceeded, in a great proportion, that in the large streets and well-aired houses. In some of the allies, a third or fourth of the whole of the inhabitants are no more. In 30 houses, the whole number in Pewter Platter alley, 32 peo∣ple died: and in Market-street, in 170 houses, only 39. The streets in the suburbs that had the benefit of the country air, especially towards the west part of the city, have suffered little. Of the wide, airy streets, none lost so many people as Arch, near Water-street, which may be account∣ed for by its proximity to the original seat of the disorder. It is to be particularly remarked, that in general, the more remote the streets were from Water street, the less they experienced of the calamity.</P>
<P>From the effects of this disorder, the French settled in Philadelphia, have been in a very re∣markable degree exempt. To what this may be owing, is a subject deserving particular investiga∣tion. By some it has been ascribed to their de∣spising the danger. But, though this may have had some effect, it will not certainly account for it altogether; as it is well known that
<PB N="76" REF="025255_0072_0FCCEDC12346E628"/>
many of the most courageous persons in Phila∣delphia, have been among its victims. By many of the French, the prevalence and mortality of the disorder have been attributed to the vast quantities of crude and unwholesome fruits brought to our markets, and consumed by all classes of people.</P>
<P>The effect of fear in predisposing the body for this and other disorders, and increasing their malignance, when taken, is well known. The following exception to the general rule, for the truth of which I pledge myself, is curious and interesting. A young woman, whose fears were so very prevalent, as not only to render her un∣happy from the commencement of the disorder, but even to interfere with the happiness of the family with whom she lived, had to attend on seven persons, all of whom were in a very dan∣gerous state, and one of whom died. Her at∣tendance was assiduous and unremitted for nearly three weeks. Yet she has never been in the slightest degree affected.</P>
<P>At an early stage of the disorder, the elders of the African church met, and offered their
<PB N="77" REF="025255_0073_0FCCEDC5CAFC8BB8"/>
services to the mayor, to procure nurses for the sick, and to assist in burying the dead. Their offers were accepted; and Absalom Jones and Richard Allen undertook the former de∣partment, that of furnishing nurses, and Wil∣liam Gray, the latter—the interment of the dead. The great demand for nurses afforded an opportunity for imposition, which was eager∣ly seized by some of the vilest of the blacks. They extorted two, three, four, and even five dollars a night for attendance, which would have been well paid by a single dollar. Some of them were even detected in plundering the houses of the sick. But it is wrong to cast a censure on the whole for this sort of conduct, as many people have done. The services of Jones, Allen, and Gray, and others of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ur, have been very great, and demand public grati∣tude.</P>
<P>When the yellow fever prevailed in South Carolina, the negroes, according to that accu∣rate observer, Dr. Lining, were wholly free from it.
<Q>There is something very singular in the constitution of the negroes,</Q>
says he,
<Q>which renders them not liable to this fever;
<PB N="78" REF="025255_0074_0FCCEDC837FFA9B0"/>
for though many of them were as much ex∣posed as the nurses to this infection; yet I never knew one instance of this fever among them, though they are equally subject with the white people to the bilious fever.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and observations, vol. II. page 407.</NOTE> The same idea prevailed for a considerable time in Philadelphia; but it was erroneous. They did not escape the disorder; however, the number of them that were seized with it, was not great; and, as I am informed by an eminent doctor,
<Q>it yielded to the power of medicine in them more easily than in the whites.</Q></P>
<P>Those who reflect on the many revolting ca∣ses of cruelty and desertion of friends and re∣lations which occurred in Philadelphia, how∣ever they may regret, cannot be surprised, that in the country and in various towns and cities, inhumanity should be experienced by Philadel∣phians from strangers. The universal conster∣nation extinguished in people's breasts the most honourable feelings of human nature; and in this case, as in various others, the sus∣picion
<PB N="79" REF="025255_0075_0FCCEDC96E04CEB8"/>
operated as injuriously as the reality. Many travellers from this city, exhausted with fatigue and with hunger, have been refused all shelter and all sustenance, and have fallen victims to the fears, not to the want of cha∣rity, of those to whom they applied for re∣lief. Instances of this kind have occurred on almost every road leading from Philadelphia. People under suspicion of having this disorder, have been forced by their fellow travellers to quit the stages, and perished in the woods without a possibility of procuring any assistance. At Milford, in Delaware state, a waggon-load of goods from Philadelphia, was actually burn∣ed; and a woman, who came with it, was tar∣red and feathered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am informed that a respectable merchant in this city can vouch for the truth of this circumstance.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is one fact respecting this disorder, which renders it probable, that the exercise of the duties of humanity towards the fugitive Philadelphans, would not have been attended with the danger universally imagined. In defi∣ance
<PB N="80" REF="025255_0076_0FCCEDCAD423B360"/>
of all the resolutions entered into by the in∣habitants of various towns, many of our infect∣ed citizens evaded their vigilance, and took re∣fuge among them, and in only one or two ca∣ses is it known that they communicated the disorder—and even in these not mortally. Three persons from Philadelphia died of this disorder, in one house at Woodbury, in New Jersey; they had been attended during their illness by the family, none of whom caught the infection. Six or seven died at Darby, as ma∣ny at Germantown, and eight at Haddonfield, without communicating it to any of the inhabi∣tants. A man from Philadelphia, of the name of Cornell, died in New York, about two days after his arrival. The place of his death was a boarding house, in which were a number of boarders, one of whom slept in the same bed with him. Two of the family only were slight∣ly affected—but not in such a degree as to re∣quire medical aid. Three other infected per∣sons from our city, who, when discovered, were removed to Governor's island, died there, and no one took the disorder from them. A man died at one of the principal taverns in Bal∣timore, of the same disorder. Many people had
<PB N="81" REF="025255_0077_0FCCEDCD2F32F260"/>
visited and attended him during the whole of his illness, without injury. No person was af∣fected but his doctor, whose indisposition was not of long continuance. A great number of similar instances have occurred at Burlington, Bordenton, Lamberton, Princeton, Brunswic, Woodbridge, Newark, Lancaster, and various other places, and in no case, except those at Bal∣timore and New York, has the infection spread.</P>
<P>The terror that prevailed in Philadelphia, and which was spread through the continent, arose from the fatality of the disorder at first, very few of those who took it then having esca∣ped. This, with all deference to the medical gentlemen, arose probably from their being un∣acquainted with it. That this was the case, is candily acknowledged by several of the most eminent among them. The fact is, that the ter∣ror was at no time greater, than about the end of August, at which period, the deaths did not very far exceed the usual number in that month. When the mortality raged most dreadfully, from the middle of September to the middle of October, the public were much less alarmed, owing to the occurrence of several recoveries,
<PB N="82" REF="025255_0078_0FCCD92B9B853638"/>
and their becoming callous by the force of ha∣bit. During this time it was, that all the spon∣ges, smelling bottles, handkerchiefs steeped in vinegar, camphor bags, &amp;c. disappeared.</P>
<P>The state of the police and of society in Phila∣delphia, appears to no small advantage, when we consider one circumstance. Notwithstanding the absence of the magistrates, and the immense value of property left unprotected through the fears of the owners, and the deaths of the per∣sons left to take care of it, we have as yet heard of only one or two burglaries committed.— Another was attempted, but the plunderers were discovered and taken. A hardened villain from a neighbouring state, formed a plot with some negroes to plunder houses. He was a master rogue, had digested a complete system, and formed a large partnership for the more success∣ful execution of his schemes. However he was soon seized, and the company dissolved.</P>
<P>The jail of Philadelphia is under such excel∣lent regulation, that the disorder made its ap∣pearance there only in two or three instances, although such abodes of misery are the places
<PB N="83" REF="025255_0079_0FCCEDD4519A5130"/>
where contagious disorders are most commonly generated. When the yellow fever raged most violently in the city, there were in the jail one hundred and six French soldiers and sailors, confined by order of the French consul, be∣sides eighty convicts, vagrants, and persons for trial; all of whom, except two or three, remained perfectly free from the complaint. Several circumstances have conspired to pro∣duce this salutary effect. The people confined are frequently cleansed and purified by the use of the cold bath—they are kept constantly em∣ployed—vegetables form a considerable part of their diet—in the yard, vegetation flourishes —and many of them being employed in stone cutting, the water, constantly running, keeps the atmosphere in a moist state, while the peo∣ple of Philadelphia have been uninterruptedly parched up by unceasing heat. Elijah Weed, the late jailor, caught the disorder in the city, in the performance of the paternal duties to∣wards his daughter, and died in the jail, without communicating it to any of the people confined. I hope I shall be pardoned for pay∣ing a tribute to the memory of this valuable citizen, under whose government of the jail,
<PB N="84" REF="025255_0080_0FCCEDD5F3F61BD8"/>
and with whose hearty co-operation, most of the regulations in that institution have been effected, which, with the successful experi∣ments made in England, prove that jails may be easily converted from sinks of human depra∣vity and wretchedness, into places of reforma∣tion; so that, instead of rendering the idle vagrant, confined merely on suspicion, or for want of friends to protect him, obdurate, wicked, and ripe for rapine and spoil, the profligate and abandoned may leave them in a situation to become useful members of society. For the honour of human nature, it ought to be recorded, that some of the convicts in the jail, a part of the term of whose confinement had been remitted as a reward for their peace∣able, orderly behaviour, voluntarily offered themselves as nurses to attend the sick at Bush-hill, and have in that capacity conducted themselves with so much fidelity and tender∣ness, that they have had the repeated thanks of the managers. Among them are some who were formerly regarded, and with justice, as har∣dened abandoned villains, which the old system was calculated to make every tenant of a jail, who remained there a few weeks. According
<PB N="85" REF="025255_0081_0FCCEDD7AC129F90"/>
to the same summary system, these men's lives would have been long since offered up as an atonement to society for the injury they had done it. That is, in plain English, because so∣ciety had suffered one injury by rapine, it was necessary it should suffer another by law. But by the improved plan, they and great num∣bers of others are restored to society and usefulness once more. So much better, although not quite so easy, is it to reform men, than to butcher them under colour of law and justice.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1791, the yellow fever pre∣vailed in New York, in a part of Water-street; and in proportion to the sphere of its action was as fatal there as it has been here. It began in August, and continued till the middle of September, when it totally disappeared, and has never since visited that place. This should ease the fears of many among us, who, always viewing the black side of every thing, terrify people with their prognostications, that we shall have it again next spring or summer. All the symptoms were full as dangerous and alarming in New York, as in Philadelphia. Many persons died in three days;
<Q>stupor,
<PB N="86" REF="025255_0082_0FCCEDD920D63448"/>
delirium, yellowness, the black vomit, and death, rapidly succeeding each other.</Q>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Letter from a physician in New York, to his friend in New Jersey, Federal Gazette, Sept. 21, 1793.</NOTE> It spread no farther at that time, than the one street, although no precautions, as far as I can learn, were taken to prevent its extension. The same species of disorder raged in this city in 1762, with great violence. It disappeared in the month of November, and has not from that time until this year visited Philadel∣phia.</P>
<P>The summer and fall of this year have been unhealthy in many parts of the union, as well as in Philadelphia. At Lynn, in Massachusetts, I have been informed, but have no means of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the re∣port, that a malignant fever, not unlike ours, prevailed in August. In many of the towns of Virginia, fevers and agues have been much more prevalent and dangerous then they have been at former periods. Georgetown and its vicinity, which are in general very healthy, lost,
<PB N="87" REF="025255_0083_0FCCEDDACA110AA8"/>
in the course of a few weeks in summer, an un∣exampled number of people by the flux, which disorder has raged with great violence in many other places. The influenza has spread general∣ly through the union, and been very fatal. It has been twice in Vermont, where likewise the putrid sore throat has carried off numbers. At Harrisburg and Middletown, in this state, the flux and a putrid fever have been extremely destructive, and swept away, I am credibly in∣formed, a fifteenth part of the inhabitants. Delaware state, particularly Kent county has suffered much from the flux, which has produ∣ced a very great mortality. And various other places have experienced a mortality, very un∣common, and which, but for the calamity of Philadelphia absorbing public attention every where, would have created great alarms and uneasiness.</P>
<P>Although the proceedings of many people in Philadelphia have been strongly tinctured with cruelty, and a total direliction of every princi∣ple of humanity, yet the general conduct has not been so revolting as in London during the plague. In that city, when a house was known to
<PB N="88" REF="025255_0084_0FCCEDDC443EEA00"/>
have an infected person in it, it was fastened up, and a guard placed at the door, to prevent any one from coming out, until after a quarantine of 40 days; and if, during that time, any other was infected, a new quarantine was imposed. Thus entire families fell sacrifices to an order, equal∣ly senseless and cruel; and by these means, dead bodies lay often for weeks together in the most dreadful and noxious state of putrefaction. Such revolting orders existed not in Philadel∣phia. However, there have been various instan∣ces of houses being left to the care of a servant or two, who fell sick, and having no means of communicating their distresses to the neigh∣bours, perished for want of assistance.</P>
<P>I have learned with great pleasure, that a few landlords, commiserating the distresses of their tenants, have come to the very humane reso∣lution of remitting the payment of rents du∣ring the prevalence of the disorder. Were they to enter into resolutions generally to do the same, it would reflect honour on them. But there are some whose hardened hearts know no com∣passion, and who will have
<Q>the pound of flesh—the penalty of the bond.</Q>
Indeed,
<PB N="89" REF="025255_0085_0FCCEDDDC2036D38"/>
when the disorder was at the highest stage, some landlords seized the small property of poor roomkeepers, who were totally unable to pay their rent. One man wrote to the com∣mittee, informing them that the poverty of his tenants rendered it impossible for them to pay him; he therefore begged the commit∣tee would, as they were appointed to relieve the poor, pay the arrearages due to him. Another person, a wealthy widow, produced recommendations for several poor roomkeepers, her tenants; and the committee gave them each a small firm. As soon as they had received it, she seized the money and their clothes!</P>
<P>As I have been obliged to note a variety of horrid circumstances, which have a ten∣dency to throw a shade over the human charac∣ter, it is proper to let in a little light on the subject, wherever justice and truth will per∣mit. Amidst the general desertion that prevail∣ed, there were to be found many illustrious instances of men and women, some in the mid∣dle, others in the lower spheres of life, who have, in the exercise of the duties of humanity, exposed themselves to dangers, which terri∣fied
<PB N="90" REF="025255_0086_0FCCEDDF30646998"/>
men, who have hundreds of times faced death without fear, in the field of battle. Some of them, alas! have fallen in the good cause! But why should they be regretted! ne∣ver could they have fallen more glorirusly. Foremost in this noble groups stands Joseph In∣skeep, a most excellent man in every of the so∣cial relations, of citizen, brother, husband, and friend—To the sick and the forsaken, whether he was acquainted with them or not, has he devoted his hours, to relieve and comfort them in their tribulation. Numerous are the instan∣ces of men restored, by his kind cares and at∣tention, to their families from the very jaws of death.—In various cases has he been obliged to put dead bodies into coffins, when no other person could be had to perform that office. An∣drew Adgate's merit in the same way, was conspicuous, and of the last importance to num∣bers of distressed creatures, bereft of every other comfort. Of those worthy men, Wilson, and Tomkins, I have already spoken. The rev. mr. Fleming and the rev. mr. Winkhause, exhausted themselves by a succession of labours, day and night, attending on the sick, and mi∣nistering relief to their spiritual and temporal
<PB N="91" REF="025255_0087_0FCCEDE0A4702000"/>
wants. Of those who have happily survived their dangers, and are preserved to their fellow citi∣zens, I shall mention a few. They enjoy the su∣preme reward of a self-approving conscience; and I readily believe, that in the most secret recesses, remote from the public eye, they would have done the same. But next to the sense of having done well, is, I believe, the approbation of our friends and fellow men; and when the debt is great, and the only payment that can be made is applause, it is surely the worst species of avarice to withhold it. We are always ready, too ready to bestow censure—and, as if anxious lest we should not give enough, we generally heap the measure. When we are so solicitous to deter by reproach from folly, vice, and crime, why not be equally disposed to stimulate to vir∣tue and heroism, by freely bestowing the well-earned plaudit? The rev. Henry Helmuth's merits are of the most exalted kind. His whole time, during the prevalence of the disorder, was spent in the performance of the works of mercy, visiting and relieving the sick, comfort∣ing the afflicted, and feeding the hungry. Of his congregation, some hundreds have paid the last debt to nature, since the malignant fever
<PB N="92" REF="025255_0088_0FCCEDE229A489A8"/>
began; and, I believe, he attended nearly the whole of them. To so many dangers was he exposed, that he stands a living miracle of pre∣servation. The rev. C. V. Keating and the rev. mr. Ustick have been in the same career, and performed their duties to the sick with equal fidelity, and with equal danger. The venerable old citizen, Samuel Robesen, has been like a good angel, indefatigably performing, in families where there was not one person able to help another, even the menial offices of the kitchen, in every part of his neighbourhood. John Con∣nelly has spent hours beside the sick, when their own wives and children had abandoned them. Twice did he catch the disorder—twice was he on the brink of the grave, which was yawning to receive him—yet, unappalled by the immi∣nent danger he had escaped, he again returned to the charge. I feel myself affected at this part of my subject, with emotions, in which I hope my reader will participate. And, as a human being, I rejoice that it has fallen to my lot, to be a witness and recorder of a magnanimity which would alone be sufficient to rescue the character of man from obloquy and reproach.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="025255_0089_0FCCEDE71A322570"/>Shall I be pardoned for passing a censure on those, whose mistaken zeal led them, during the most dreadful stages of this calamity, to croud some of our churches, and aid this frightful ene∣my in his work of destruction? who, fearful lest their prayers and adoration at home would not find acceptance before the Deity, resorted to churches filled with bodies of contagious air, where with every breath they inhaled, they drew in noxious miasmata? Surely yes. To this cause I am bold in ascribing a large proportion of the mortality—And it is remarkable, that those congregations, whose places of worship were most crouded, have suffered the most dreadful∣ly. Will men never acquire wisdom? Are we yet to learn that the Almighty architect of the heavens and the earth does not require
<Q>tem∣ples made with men's hands?</Q>
that going to a place of worship, against the great law of self preservation, implanted in indelible characters by his divine hand, on the breast of every one of his creatures, constitutes no part of the ado∣ration due to the maker and preserver of man∣kind? That a "meek and humble heart"; the temple wherein he delights to be worship∣ped? I hope not—I hope the awful lesson some
<PB N="94" REF="025255_0090_0FCCD92D04B0D9F8"/>
of our congregations hold forth on this subject, by a mortality out of all proportion to their numbers, will serve as a memento at all future times, in the like critical emergencies!</P>
<P>Of the number of citizens who fled away, it is difficult to form any accurate estimate. In the city, from Vine to South street, which has been surveyed by a man employed by the com∣mittee, of 21,000 inhabitants, the number of absent people is stated to be 8600. But as this business was several weeks performing, con∣siderable variations must necessarily have taken place. The emigration was not finished in those streets examined in the early part of his pro∣gress, —and towards the latter part, the immi∣gration had been already considerable. Allow∣ing one to balance the other, and the remo∣vals in the liberties to have been equal to those in the city, we shall probably nor err much when we estimate the number who left the city at about 17,000. This is not so many as I supposed when I last wrote on the subject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Independent Gazetteer, October 26.</NOTE>, at which time
<PB N="95" REF="025255_0091_0FCCEDE8804D1660"/>
I estimated them at 23,000. Which of the two is accurate, or whether either of them is so, I leave the reader to determine.</P>
<P>Some of those who remained in the city, have, for reasons not very easy to justify, been in the habit of reproaching those who fled, with criminality, as deserters, who abandoned their posts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">If they were even guilty of a crime, it brought its own punishment; as I am fully convinced that those who were absent, and a prey to the anxiety caused by the frightful reports current, suffered more than those who remained. I speak from experience. In a few days absence, when the disorder had not reached its summit, I heard more terrific accounts of it, than in as many weeks in Philadelphia, when it raged most violen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> off from eighty to a hundred daily.</NOTE>. I believe, on the contrary, that as the nature of our government did not al∣low the arbitrary measures to be pursued, which, in despotic countries would probably have ex∣tinguished the disorder at an early period —it was the duty of every person to avoid the danger, whose circumstances and situation al∣lowed it. The effects of the desertion were,
<PB N="96" REF="025255_0092_0FCCEDEA7583C888"/>
moreover, salutary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps had all our citizens remained, we should have had famine added to our calamity; whereas we had plentiful markets during the whole time. The prices, too, were in general not far beyond what they are usually at the same season of the year.</NOTE>. The sphere of action of the disorder was diminished. Two or three empty houses arrested the disease in its progress, as it was slowly, but surely travelling through a street, and probably rescued a neighbourhood from its ravages. We shall long have to mourn the severe loss our city has felt, in being bereft of so many valuable citizens: and had the 17,000 who retired, been in the city during the prevalence of the disorder, and lost as large a proportion of their number, as those did who re∣mained, we should, instead of 4000 dead, have lost nearly 6000; and perhaps had to deplore in the number, another Clow, a Kay, a Lea, a Sims, a Dunkin, a Strawbridge, men of exten∣sive business, whose loss will be long felt—a Pen∣nington, a Glentworth, a Hutchinson, a Sar∣jeant, a Howell, men endowed by heaven with eminent abilities—a Fleming, a Graissl, a Sproat, men of exalted piety and virtue—a Wil∣son,
<PB N="97" REF="025255_0093_0FCCEDEBD415EFF0"/>
an Adgate, a Baldwin, a Carroll, a Tom∣kins, citizens of most estimable characters. Let those, then, who have remained, regard their long-absent friends, as if preserved from death by their flight, and rejoice at their return in health and safety—let those who have been ab∣sent, acknowledge the exertions of those who maintained their ground. Let us all unite in the utmost vigilance to prevent the return of this fell destroyer, by the most scrupulous at∣tention to cleansing and purifying our scourged city—and let us join in thanksgiving to that Su∣preme Being, who has, in his own time, stay∣ed the avenging storm, ready to devour us, after it had laughed to scorn all human efforts.</P>
<P>I omitted to inform the reader in the proper place, that dr. Deveze and dr. Benjamin Duf∣field have gratuitously and with the utmost punctuality, attended at Bushhill hospital nearly from the organization of the committee to the present time.</P>
