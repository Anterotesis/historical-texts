<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Kind Approbation with which YOU have favoured this DISCOURSE, is as much an Honour as it is a Satisfaction to me; for which I desire Your Excellency to accept my grateful Acknowledgments: And as You, with many other Honourable Gentlemen, have, in so particularly obliging a Manner, signified Your Desire of seeing it published, I have complied with Your Request; which, indeed, I must own, You put it out of my Power to refuse. I heartily
<PB N="iv" REF="010977_0003_0F8530D998A2EE38"/>
pray GOD it may be attended with those benefi∣cial Effects, which You seem to entertain so much Hopes of: And if it should be instrumental in bringing any to a just Sense of the great DUTY inculcated therein, and a religious Observance of it for the future, My Pleasure would be greatly heightened, by the Happiness I am sensible You will receive Yourself. With My earnest Wishes for Your Excellency's present Felicity, as well as Eternal Wellfare, which it will always be a pe∣culiar Joy to Me to promote,</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ST. PAUL's</HI> Epistle to the <HI>ROMANS, Chap. XIII. Verses 1st &amp; 2d.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Let every Soul be subject unto the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</P>
<P>Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God; and they that resist, shall receive to themselves Damnation.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I AM persuaded, that every one who feels the least regard for the wellfare and happiness of his country; and the peace and comfort of his fellow-subjects and countrymen, will look upon the subject as highly proper, and seasonable at this time.</P>
<P>FOR who can reflect upon so many wretched and unthinking men, thus madly attempting to subvert the laws of the kingdom; thus inconsiderately involving friends, relations and neighbours, in the most direful calamity, and foolishly bringing upon themselves de∣struction here, and damnation hereafter:—who can look upon so deplorable a seene, without feeling the most earnest desires, that every such rash and misguided person could be made duly sensible of the dreadful impiety of so daring and wicked an action, as well as of the certain misery that must inevitably be the consequence?</P>
<P>IT is possible this alarming consideration may prevail with some persons, when every other more laudable motive fails of its proper influence; and, it is to be hoped, that a sight of their danger may bring them to a sense of their duty.</P>
<P>WITH this view, I have singled out the words of the text for the subject of our present meditation: And though I have the plea∣sure to think I am speaking before those who stand not in need of
<PB N="2" REF="010977_0005_0F8530DF26EF9720"/>
the admonition they contain, yet I thought it not improper for us to consider the several arguments which enforce this great duty here enjoined; that we may not only be preserv'd stedfast in our obe∣dience to it ourselves, but may be able to convince others of the danger, as well as error of their ways; and keep them, for the fu∣ture, in the paths of duty and allegiance, from which they have lately so unhappily wandered.</P>
<P>YOU cannot but observe then, in the first place, that this impor∣tant duty of subjection to lawful authority, is one plain and prin∣cipal doctrine of christianity. It is here delivered to the world by an inspired Apostle of CHRIST; by <HI>Him,</HI> whom our LORD, in a vision to <HI>Ananias,</HI> honours with the distinguishing title of <HI>"a cho∣sen vessel to Himself."</HI> He it is, who, thus commissioned from above, gives us, in the name of the most high GOD, this solemn command in the words of the text; to which we are, all of us, both high and low, rich and poor, wise and ignorant, indispensably obliged to pay the highest reverence and regard; and no rank nor station in life, can possibly exempt any one from the strictest obe∣dience to it: For it is directed to all men in general, without any exception—<HI>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers</HI>—and it comes to us by the <HI>Authority</HI> of the same GOD and SAVIOUR, who has given us every other precept that we meet with in holy scripture:—It comes to us from that sovereign LORD OF ALL LORDS, whose name we have the honour to bear; whose subjects we profess ourselves at present; and whose eternal kingdom we hope to become inheritors of hereafter: 'Till men, therefore, have renounced CHRIST, and apostatized from <HI>his</HI> religion—'till they have disowned <HI>his</HI> sovereignty and dominion over them, and given up all expectations of future happiness from his favour, they must ac∣knowledge themselves bound, by the strongest ties, both of interest and gratitude, to comply with this sacred injunction, no less than with every other command of <HI>his Divine Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>BUT we may still further judge of the singular importance of this duty enjoined us in the text, from that remarkable stress laid upon
<PB N="3" REF="010977_0006_0F8530E027840338"/>
it by the great Apostle in several other of his Epistles. When he is delivering his apostolical injunctions to <HI>Titus,</HI> and instructing him in the several branches of his duty as a minister of <HI>Christ,</HI> he gives it him in charge, in a very solemn manner, to put men in mind, to be subject to principalities and powers; to obey <HI>Magistrates</HI>; to speak evil of <HI>no man</HI>; to be no <HI>brawlers,</HI> but <HI>gentle</HI>; shewing all <HI>meekness</HI> to <HI>all men.</HI> These things, says he, I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God, that is, they who have acknowledged the truth of that revelation <HI>he</HI> has made us in the Gospel, might be careful to maintain good works: These things are good and profitable unto men.</P>
<P>AND in the first Epistle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> he carries this request and reverence for the powers that are lawfully set over us, to a still grea∣ter height; making it our duty, not only to be subject unto them, but to implore the favour of Heaven upon them, and the divine blessing on their endeavours for the public happiness and tranquility. <HI>I exhort first of all,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>that Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty; for this is good, and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>JUDGE therefore in yourselves, my beloved brethren, and beseech others, in the name of God, to consider how dreadful a breach of this duty they must be guilty of, who, instead of praying for the safety of our governors and protectors, presume to threaten their sacred persons with violence, to whom God has commanded us to pay the highest veneration, because they derive their authority from <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>AND this leads me to a second very material argument, arising from the words of the text, which strongly enforces this duty, and to which it becomes every one seriously to attend: For surely no∣thing should more fully convince us of our obligation to pay the most ready obedience to this precept of christianity, than the solemn reason which the Apostle has immediately subjoined: <HI>Let every soul
<PB N="4" REF="010977_0007_0F8530E05ADB9470"/>
be subject to the higer powers; for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI></P>
<P>HAD this precept been delivered to mankind without pointing out to them at the same time, this particularly awful sanction; yet even then our observance of it would have remained indispensible: For when God commands, man is to obey.</P>
<P>THAT God, from <HI>whom</HI> we have received life and breath, and all things, and to <HI>whom</HI> we are indebted for every comfort and blessing we enjoy—that God, upon <HI>whom alone</HI> we are to depend to all eternity, and by <HI>whom</HI> our unalterable fate is to be finally de∣termined;—this great and adorable BEING has an uncontroula∣ble right over <HI>his</HI> dependent creatures, to lay upon them whatever commands <HI>his</HI> wisdom sees proper for them, without being obliged to satisfy them of the reasons for such his sovereign will and pleasure. But in the case before us, you cannot but take notice, in how very different a manner God has been pleased to deal with us; for while he gives us this command by his holy Apostle, he graciously con∣descends to inform us of those weighty reasons upon which the duty is founded, and which would be most likely to engage us in a re∣ligious observance of it.</P>
<P>WE are commanded, therefore, <HI>to be subject to the higher powers,</HI> because the authority they are invested with is from HEAVEN: <HI>The powers that be, are ordained of God!</HI>—They are God's vicegerents upon earth, and instruments in the hand of his providence, for car∣rying on the grand purposes of protection and government, and for securing the peace and happiness of mankind.</P>
<P>AND though, indeed, they are sometimes unhappily obliged, through the perverseness and wickedness that is in the world, to be∣come <HI>unwilling</HI> avengers, to execute wrath upon every one that doth evil; yet are they, in general, the ministers of God to us, for good, and for the praise and reward of them that do well.</P>
<P>WAS it not for this necessary power which has been committed to them by the ALMIGHTY, every thing must soon be involved in the most dreadful anarchy and confusion. Every man's own will
<PB N="5" REF="010977_0008_0F8530E10DAACB68"/>
would then be his law; and no language can fully describe those various scenes of misery and horror which would continually arise before us, from the discordant passions and divided interests of man∣kind. But God, in his infinite goodness, has provided a natural security against all these mischiefs in those different ranks and or∣ders of men, which his wisdom has thought proper should subsist in the world; and in which some are allotted to govern, and others obliged to obey, that so the happiness of the whole community might the more effectually be preserved. And upon these <HI>guardians</HI> of the public and general wellfare, God has been pleased to confer a divine authority, to render their persons, as well as ordinances, the more sacred and venerable.</P>
<P>IT is by <HI>him,</HI> therefore, that kings reign, and princes decree justice; by <HI>him</HI> princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth: And as it is very beautifully expressed in the book of Wis∣dom, <HI>power</HI> is given them of the LORD, and <HI>sovereignty</HI> from the <HI>Highest:</HI> To the truth of this important point, we have a greater than <HI>Solomon</HI> bearing testimony; even our blessed Saviour himself; <HI>who,</HI> when <HI>Pilate</HI> was boasting of that power he had over <HI>him,</HI> ei∣ther to crucify or to release <HI>him,</HI> puts him in mind from whence he had received his authority; and gives him this mild and instructive answer, <HI>Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we learn from the mouth of our <HI>Redeemer himself,</HI> whence is derived that dignity and sacredness, which belongs to those who are invested with any public power and office.—Here we behold the God of the universe submitting to that supreme authority <HI>he himself</HI> has conferred upon man; and acknowledging the reverence due to that very power, which was shortly to pronounce the sentence of death against <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>BUT we have a still more striking and remarkable instance of sub∣mission and respect to the <HI>Civil Powers,</HI> which our blessed Lord, upon another occasion, condescended to shew, and which highly deserves every one's serious attention and regard: It is recorded by the
<PB N="6" REF="010977_0009_0F8530E1D3DE22C8"/>
Evangelist St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> in the 17th chapter of his Gospel, that when our Lord was come to <HI>Capernaum,</HI> they who received the tri∣bute money, which was required of every Jew above the age of twenty, demanded of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> whether his <HI>Master</HI> intended to pay it. St. <HI>Peter</HI> very readily engages for his Lord's willing and chear∣ful compliance; as he well knew how exact had ever been <HI>his</HI> ob∣servance of every civil, as well as religious duty: But when he came into the house to inform his master of this demand, our <HI>blessed Sa∣viour,</HI> by an easy similitude, leads him to understand, that he had been too hasty in his promises for <HI>him</HI>; for surely, if the children of earthly princes could plead a freedom from paying any custom or tribute, (as appeared by his own reply to the question our Lord had proposed) much more reasonably might <HI>he</HI> be exempted from it, who was <HI>himself</HI> the <HI>Lord of all things,</HI> and the <HI>Son</HI> of that hea∣venly <HI>King,</HI> for the service of <HI>whose</HI> temple this particular tribute was paid.—But notwithstanding our Lord might have justly claimed this privilege and exemption; yet, you see, <HI>he</HI> willingly declines it; and, <HI>Least we should offend them,</HI> says <HI>he</HI> to the Apostle, <HI>go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shall find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them for me and for thee.</HI>—What condescen∣sion was this in the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God!</HI>—Who but must be struck with admiration at this amazing instance of <HI>goodness,</HI> in thus vouch∣safing to work a miracle, rather than not satisfy the demands of public authority; lest, by refusing compliance <HI>himself,</HI> he might countenance others in disobedience and rebellion! And who is there that will presume to offer insult to the powers that are in authority, or shew the least resistance, when he considers how remarkably our Lord was pleased to honour them, by expressing the most cautious fear of displeasing them, and thus wonderfully providing against giving any offence?—In order, therefore, to guard men from in∣curring the guilt of so heinous a crime, let us, in the third place, briefly consider the dreadful conquences that must attend it.—This the Apostle gives us, in these few, but awful words, <HI>They that
<PB N="7" REF="010977_0010_0F8530E291579EF8"/>
resist, shall receive to themselves</HI> DAMNATION; not only condemna∣tion in this <HI>world,</HI> but <HI>eternal vengeance</HI> in the <HI>life</HI> to <HI>come.</HI>—And here again, we cannot but observe, the great importance of this duty of subjection, from that tender care which the goodness of GOD has taken to secure our obedience to it. Some precepts are delivered to us without any particular intimation of the punishment attending our neglect: But this was a matter of so much con∣sequence to the general comfort and happiness of the world, that the <HI>divine wisdom</HI> thought it necessary for us, while we read the sa∣cred injunction, to have before our eyes that future misery which must follow the violation of it: So that, if the love of God, and reverence for <HI>his</HI> commands, should fail to produce this becoming submission, a regard for our own <HI>Everlasting Interest</HI> might possibly prevail.</P>
<P>GOD has, therefore, been pleased, by <HI>his</HI> holy Apostle, to pro∣nounce the sentence of <HI>inevitable perdition upon all those who re∣fuse subjection to lawful power and authority</HI>; as hereby, they not only shew the highest contempt of <HI>his</HI> positive command, but do all in their power to obstruct the gracious desings of <HI>his</HI> providence, for the <HI>good</HI> and <HI>wellfare</HI> of <HI>mankind.</HI> So that, upon calm conside∣ration, every one must acknowledge, there cannot possibly be of∣fered a greater insult to <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, than thus contemptuously to disregard <HI>his</HI> will, and dispise those sacred powers whom <HI>he</HI> has ordained and appointed to carry on the best and noblest purposes in the world: And what wonder then is it that so terrible a portion is reserved in store for every such bold and presumptuous offender?—GOD is represented in scripture as the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Lover</HI> of <HI>Con∣cord</HI>; and we are, for this reason, commanded, in another place, to follow peace with <HI>all men</HI>; because, without this, no man shall see the LORD. Every one, therefore, shall hereafter be banished from <HI>his</HI> presence and glory who dares to disturb, in the least de∣gree, that peace and harmony; or endeavours, in any respect, to destroy that good order and government, which it is the intention of HEAVEN should be supported in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010977_0011_0F8530E35061C190"/>BUT though we were not able to assign any particular reason for this severe judgment mentioned in the text, yet ought it to be a sufficient warning to every rebellious sinner, to find how positively it is there denounced: For what God has so solemnly threatened, <HI>he</HI> will most assuredly inflict.</P>
<P>THESE then are the principal reasons which enforce the duty en∣joined by the Apostle; but there are several others, which, if duly attended to, cannot but add considerable weight to the arguments already offered, and which I shall, therefore, beg leave briefly to mention.</P>
<P>LET it be considered then, that resistance to that lawful power and authority which God hath set over us, can never possibly be productive of any thing but the wildest uproar, and most universal confusion; and, in the end, can never fail of being attended with the most shocking and dismal effects.</P>
<P>OF this we would have seen a dreadful and melancholly proof; and God only knows what worse consequences might have ensued, had they not been happily prevented by the good conduct of those brave men, who distinguished themselves as remarkably by their HUMANITY, as by the VALOUR, they shewed on that trying oc∣casion.</P>
<P>To their courage and intrepidity will ever be due our warmest gratitude and thanks; which, blessed be God, gave so timely a check to the desperate fury of those rash men who were engaged in that execrable attempt; and to their humanity these very men must ever acknowledge themselves obliged, which bore so long and pa∣tiently their repeated and exasperating insults, and treated them after∣wards with greater lenity than they could reasonably expect; for where one has not fallen, twenty ought to have suffered.</P>
<P>LET every one learn, that outrage and violence can never answer any other end but to spread slaughter and desolation around us; and to introduce the most wretched scenes of misery and distress: Let them consider further, how impossible it is that any good can ever be brought about by such wicked means; and that tho' some
<PB N="9" REF="010977_0012_0F8530E40FBD76F8"/>
may only meet the ruin their rashness has sought, yet many others must unavoidably become partakers in the calamity, who were ne∣ver partners in the crime.</P>
<P>THE consideration therefore of the present misfortunes, in which many of their fellow-creatures must be involved, as well as the fu∣ture destruction to which others are exposed by such daring acts of rebellion, will naturally restrain every man from uniting in them who has the least spark of humanity and compassion remaining in his breast.</P>
<P>ANOTHER motive which cannot but have great weight with eve∣ry generous mind, is the reflection that every the least Insult offer∣ed to magistrates and governors, is an act of the basest ingratitude against those who are, under god, our protectors and guardians, not only from foreign Enemies, but from every domestic foe: To them we owe our security from all that numerous train of mischiefs to which we should be daily liable, from the corruption and wick∣edness of the world, if under no restraint from human laws, and and unawed by by proper authority!—To them are we indebted for the safe and comfortable enjoyment of all the blessings of private life, and all the advantages we derive from civil society!—Were there not some who would take upon them the arduous business of public government, the execution of laws, and administration of justice, how would vice and iniquity every where triumph! And what must become of the welfare and tranquility of every individual, were men left at full liberty to plan their malicious schemes against them, and knew they could safely execute them whenever they pleased? What must become of the general peace and happiness of the whole community, when fraud and injustice, oppression and violence, with every other crime that is injurious to society, might be perpetrated with impunity, and without controul? How infi∣nitely then are we obliged to those persons who willingly undertake so important a trust, and by whose care, abilities and vigilance, these evils are prevented, and the public felicity preserved? And how very
<PB N="10" REF="010977_0013_0F8530E60BDCBA58"/>
enormous and shocking is the offence, when in the discharge of their laborious office, they are treated with insolence instead of honour, and meet with threatnings instead of thanks!</P>
<P>BUT lastly, there is one remark I have further to make, and which ought to have a peculiar force with the people of this land, in leading them chearfully to that subjection which is represented in the text, as the common duty of all men.—I would beg leave to observe therefore, that for an <HI>Englishman</HI> to oppose the laws of his country, is an instance of the highest folly and contradiction we can conceive: For such is the singular excellence of our happy consti∣tution, that the laws to which our obedience is required, are, in reality, no other than what we ourselves have been partly concerned in making.</P>
<P>ALL men must know, that it is impossible for a whole province to meet together for this important work; and every one, I be∣lieve, will acknowledge, that were they so assembled, very few would be found capable of carrying it on: For as the wise son of <HI>Sirac</HI> very justly observes, <HI>How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad; that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours; and whose talk is of bullocks? They shall not be sought for in the public council; nor sit high in the congregation; they cannot sit in the judges seat, nor understand the sentence of judg∣ment:</HI> Since therefore, we cannot all be present in this great assem∣bly, wherein the weighty business of public government is transacted, we have this peculiar privilege, <HI>and a glorious one it is,</HI> of appoint∣ing such persons, in whose abilities, understanding, and integrity, we think we may safely confide, to appear for us, in that august assembly; and who are, upon that account, very properly stiled <HI>our representatives.</HI></P>
<P>IN consequence then of this choice, which we have the liberty to make, and that full power we voluntarily give into their hands; we not only yield our consent before-hand, to whatever laws they may judge it expedient to enact, but may be justly said to have had
<PB N="11" REF="010977_0014_0F8530E691B7DF98"/>
a principal share in enacting them ourselves; inasmuch as they are framed by their wisdom, and established by their authority, whom we have appointed for that very purpose.</P>
<P>So that every man, of the most common understanding, if he will allow himself a moment's reflection, may easily see how par∣ticularly it is the duty of every one of us, to submit to the laws of his land; and, how astonishining an absurdity it must appear to all the world, if ever we refuse that becoming subjection.</P>
<P>How happy would millions think themselves at this hour, who know no other law than the imperious will of some arbitrary prince, could they change situations with us, and taste the singular blessing we enjoy, in being govern'd by the laws we ourselves have made! Let us take care, we set a due value upon this inestimable privilege; lest, if we slight these distinguishing marks of God's fa∣vour, and disturb that excellent form of government which his pro∣vidence has so long preserved among us,—<HI>He</HI> may be provoked to deprive us of it, and bring upon us the misery which such ingrati∣tude would deserve.</P>
<P>I SHALL now briefly sum up what has been said in this discourse, that we may see how many, and powerful, are the arguments we are furnished with, to engage us in a stedfast observance of this duty, and enable us to convince others of their indispensible obligations to practice it.</P>
<P>YOU find, then, it is a duty which is guarded from viola∣tion by all the most sacred and awful sanctions that could possibly be thought of; and bound upon us, by every tie, civil, moral, and divine.—The peace and tranquility of our fellow-subjects and coun∣trymen demand our obedience to it.—The well-being and happiness of society in general, and the comfort and felicity of our dear rela∣tions, friends and neighbours in particular, depend upon it; and without our conscientious performance of it, an universal scene of confusion must soon prevail, and all be involved together in the deepest calamity and horror.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010977_0015_0F8530E7443193F0"/>LET all such persons therefore who dare to think of engaging in any act of rebellion and disobedience, be intreated to contemplate a little those various and horrible miseries they will unavoidably oc∣casion, and that may possibly deter them from it:—Let them listen to the cries of the disconlate widow;—behold the tears of the helpless orphan; and consider, how they will be able to endure the sad upbraidings of those miserable mourners, who may justly take up against them the lamentation of the prophet <HI>Jeremiah: Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto our sorrow, which your rashness and iniquity have brought upon us!</HI></P>
<P>BUT particularly let them remember, that the blood which may be shed by their means, will hereafter be required at their hands; and that every one of those unhappy souls who shall be brought to an untimely end through their evil counsels and wicked instigations, and sent into another world with all their sins about them, will rise up in judgment against them at the last day, and call for tenfold vengeance on their devoted heads.</P>
<P>LET them be farther put in mind, that gratitude to those who afford us a peaceful security from every ill, should engage us in a steady adherence to this duty, at all times and upon every occasion: Should lead us to return obedience for protection, and repay the kind exertion of their abilities and endeavours for the public happi∣ness, with the easy tribute of reverence and affection.</P>
<P>BUT some men may have neither humanity nor generosity enough in their tempers, to be affected by such considerations as these. To them therefore we must open the sacred page, (which, perhaps, they have never before looked into) and point out the solemn and posi∣tive command of God enforcing this great duty; and tho' they may not regard an earthly potentate, yet surely they will stand in awe of the MAJESTY of HEAVEN: Or, as holy <HI>Job</HI> emphatically puts the question; <HI>Shall not HIS EXCELLENCY make them afraid? and shall not His DREAD fall uopn them?</HI>—Shew them, moreover,
<PB N="13" REF="010977_0016_0F8530E7CE8767F8"/>
the foundation upon which the reasonableness of this duty is support∣ed: Tell them, that obedience to the civil powers is required of us, not only because God has commanded it, but given us also this very solemn reason, enforcing that command;—that they were instituted and ordained by Himself. When they read therefore, that there is no power but of God, beseech them seriously to con∣sider how detestable they must render themselves in His sight, who, instead of summitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, (as we are taught by another Apostle, is our bounden duty) dare to rise up themselves, and compel others to unite with them, in opposition to any law that has been legally established; or to ob∣struct the ministers of justice in the execution of that high office they are obliged by oath to discharge, and which has been derived to them from the authority of the <HI>Almighty</HI> himself.</P>
<P>NOTHING, one would think, could so effectually strengthen our ob∣ligation to the duty of subjection, as this single consideration, that whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and that every such wicked and desperate attempt is not only treason a∣gainst an earthly sovereign, but rebellion against the most high God.</P>
<P>AS a farther motive to this duty, and because example is more prevailing than precept, bid them turn their eyes upon the meek and blessed Jesus, and behold him in that gracious and condescend∣ing act of submission, I mentioned in the former part of this dis∣course.—Ask them, if they are not sensible, that He who could feed five thousand men with a few loaves and fishes, could have supported millions with the same ease, to have protected him from the resentment of the civil powers, if he had thought fit to have made the least opposition? but instead of shewing resistance, we behold Him here manifesting the most tender concern and regard for the support of their authority; and by that miraculous method he took to pay obedience to it, convincing mankind of the neces∣sity and importance of this great duty.</P>
<P>SHALL man then presume to refuse that submission which God himself has thus condescended to pay? This aimiable pattern we
<PB N="14" REF="010977_0017_0F8530EAB196EA70" MS="y"/>
have before us in the person of our great <HI>Redeemer,</HI> ought to have an irresistable influence upon all who call themselves by <HI>his</HI> name; and was, no doubt, intended for our imitation by that gracious Be∣ing, who came from HEAVEN with this peculiar design, to leave us an example that we might follow his steps.</P>
<P>FINALLY, whereas the more various and powerful the motives are, which enforce any duty, so much more aggrevated will be the crime which leads us to break through them: Oh! beseech them therefore, in the pathetic words of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> to repent of this their wickedness; and pray God, if perhaps the thought of their heart may be forgiven them. This repentance and contrition, if accom∣panied with future obedience, may not only procure them pardon at an earthly tribunal, but when they come to stand before the judg∣ment seat of CHRIST, will be one means of their obtaining mercy from the Lord in that day, and escaping the vengeance which will otherwise fall upon them. And this leads me to the last motive we have, to enforce their observance of this christian duty enjoined in the text; the consideration of that eternal misery denounced against those who neglect it.</P>
<P>IF men have no love for their country; if they have no regard for the peace and happiness of those around them; if they have neither humanity nor compassion; neither gratitude nor generosity in their breasts; if they have no veneration for their king, nor reverence for the best constitution in the world; yet they must have some affec∣tion for themselves: And though they may dispise the commands of GOD, and the example of a SAVIOUR, yet they cannot disregard their own everlasting wellfare. This motive then may possibly bring them to repentence, and a better mind, when every other has failed of its influence; and let us not omit incessantly, and importunately, to urge it upon them.</P>
<P>WARN them of the certain perdition they must inevitably bring upon themselves; and exhort them to consider in time, how fearful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the LIVING GOD! Tell them our God is a consuming fire to such workers of iniquity, and able
<PB N="15" REF="010977_0018_0F8530EAD4FBBC10" MS="y"/>
to destroy both body and soul for ever; and bid them therefore re∣member, that though they may escape from the sword of justice in this life, they cannot escape the DAMNATION OF HELL.</P>
<P>MAY the good grace of God preserve us at all times from falling into the like crime, that we may never incur so dreadful a condem∣nation. And as we of this land are peculiarly blessed at this time with one of the most aimiable and excellent Governors that ever adorned a province, who has given us his <HI>promise,</HI> that the felicity of his people shall ever be his principal care; let it be our perpetual study and delight, by every means in our power, and particularly by all dutiful submission to <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>those</HI> whom <HI>he</HI> shall set over us, to render <HI>his</HI> government as peaceful and happy to our affectionate SOVEREIGN, as he will endeavour to make it to us his grateful sub∣jects.</P>
<P>SO shall we secure the blessings of Heaven on ourselves and our posterity; and whenever we are removed out of this troublesome world, shall become members of that blessed kingdom, where uni∣versal peace and love, and uninterrupted concord and harmony, will reign for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
