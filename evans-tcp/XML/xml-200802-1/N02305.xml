<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOSHUA I. 17.</BIBL>
<Q>—<HI>Only the LORD thy GOD be with thee, as He was with</HI> Moses.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Book contains the history of <HI>Joshua'</HI>s Reign &amp; Govern∣ment, whom, after the Death of <HI>Moses,</HI> God made Chief Captain of Israel, to conduct them into the Land of <HI>Cana∣an,</HI> at once to fulfil the many Promises made to <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>Isaac</HI> and to <HI>Jacob,</HI> that their <HI>Seed</HI> shou'd inherit the Land of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> and to Execute the Curse on <HI>Canaan,</HI> which <HI>Noah</HI> by a Prophetick Spirit uttered against him, on occasion of <HI>Ham'</HI>s imprudence, irre∣verence and impudence, in discovering his
<PB N="2" REF="002741_0004_0FE61D78451DA1A0"/>
Father's Nakedness: Gen. 9 26. <HI>Blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and Canaan shall be his Ser∣vant.</HI></P>
<P>And in this Chapter we shall Observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Joshua is Divinely called to the Go∣vernment.</HI> Moses the Servant of the Lord was dead, and God appoints Joshua to stand up in his stead, and Lead His People over Jordan; and encourages him with gracious Promises of Assistance &amp; Success, from the 1<HI>st.</HI> to the 10<HI>th.</HI> Verse. It is God's work to give Rulers to a People. This Promotion comes neither from the East nor from the West, nor from the South; but God is the Judge, and He setteth up whomsoever He will, <HI>Psal.</HI> 75. 6, 7.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Joshua accepts the Government,</HI> and ad∣dresses himself to the Business of it, giving the needful Orders to all the Officers, from the 10<HI>th.</HI> to the 16<HI>th.</HI> Verse. Whatever humble apprehensions <HI>Joshua</HI> (tho' a very worthy man) might have of the Disparity between himself and <HI>Moses, his so great a Pre∣decessor,</HI> and of the Difficulty he might meet with in Managing so rough a People, as he knew they had been, yet GOD's Call must silence all Objections; and the Promise of the Divine Presence was enough to animate him with Courage chearfully to enter upon the great Work.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="3" REF="002741_0004_0FE61D78451DA1A0"/>
3. <HI>The People agree to it:</HI> Joshua shall be their Chief and Head; and virtually at least take an Oath of Fidelity to him. And whom should they Serve, but him whom the LORD had Chosen to go before them? And they answered <HI>Joshua,</HI> saying, All that thou com∣mandest us we will do, &amp; whithersoever thou sendest us we will go: According as we hearkened unto <HI>Moses</HI> in all things, so will we hearken unto thee; Only the Lord thy God be with thee, as He was with <HI>Moses.</HI> This Answer was made to <HI>Joshua,</HI> not only by the <HI>Reubenites</HI> &amp; <HI>Gadites</HI> and half-Tribe of <HI>Ma∣nasseh,</HI> to whom <HI>Moses</HI> had last of all directed his Speech, but all the Rulers of the People to whom he first gave Commandment, <HI>V.</HI> 10. In their own behalf and in behalf of all the People,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>Promise him Obedience, both as Subjects and Souldiers.</HI> All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go. And lest Joshua should fear that his Interest in their Affections was too small and that their Subjection to him would be but cool and indifferent, to remove this Suspicion they amplify their Promise &amp; tell him, That as they hearkened in all things unto <HI>Moses,</HI> so they would likewise hearken unto him. They had no great cause to glory in the goodness of their Behaviour under and
<PB N="4" REF="002741_0005_0FE61D784CA45FB8"/>
toward <HI>Moses.</HI> They had sufficiently made known their Rebellious Spirit and Stiff-neck to him, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31. 27. But altho, the Genera∣tion that were brought up in <HI>Egypt</HI> and fell in the Wilderness, were stubborn &amp; froward, yet their Children that were brought up in the Wilderness under <HI>Moses,</HI> and now made the Promise to <HI>Joshua</HI> might have been bet∣ter Behaved<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Henry</HI> in Loc.</NOTE>. A good Government hath a mighty influence into the Manners &amp; Be∣haviour of men: And it is a great advantage to be Educated under able and pious Guides. These <HI>Israelites,</HI> that were brought up under <HI>Moses,</HI> carried themselves well, both under him and under <HI>Joshua.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>They assist Joshua with their good Wishes in his great Undertaking.</HI> Only the Lord thy God be with thee as He was with <HI>Moses.</HI> They don't make it a condition of their O∣bedience; nor say, They will be no longer Subject to him than he shall be Prosperous. They knew <HI>Joshua</HI> well and don't seem to have laboured under a fear of his Provoking God to forsake him, or of God's failing to make good His Promise to <HI>Joshua.</HI> Ver. 5. <HI>As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee, I will not leave thee nor forsake thee.</HI> They only pray it might be unto <HI>Joshua</HI> according to
<PB N="5" REF="002741_0005_0FE61D784CA45FB8"/>
God's Word; and tacitly Exhort him to keep himself in a capacity of God's continu∣al Assistance.</P>
<P N="1">[1.] <HI>They gratefully acknowledge the Blessing they had in Moses:</HI> That he was a man that had much of the Presence of God with him in his Publick Administrations; and there∣fore their Obedience unto him was not Un∣merited. They express their Piety to GOD, &amp; their Regards to <HI>Moses.</HI> They ascribe the Glory of all the great things done for them by the hand of <HI>Moses,</HI> unto GOD. It was His Presence with <HI>Moses</HI> which was the chief Cause of all the many worthy Deeds that had been done for them, by him; And they remember <HI>Moses</HI> as a Man greatly owned of GOD in his Place and favoured much with the Divine Presence in his Conduct.</P>
<P N="2">[2] <HI>They put Respect upon Joshua, wishing the blessing of his Predecessor might come upon him:</HI> As they purposed to pay the like Obedience to him which they gave to <HI>Moses.</HI> They had changed their Ruler, but were concerned that they might not lose that which had been the beauty and the strength of their Government, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> the Presence of GOD with their Ruler: and therefore pray that the Spirit of <HI>Moses</HI> might rest in a double portion upon <HI>Joshua,</HI> and that the same GOD that
<PB N="6" REF="002741_0006_0FE61D7955C12338"/>
had helped <HI>Moses</HI> all his Days, would carry <HI>Joshua</HI> well through all his Work.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> As Gratitude to the Father of Lights from whom comes every good &amp; perfect gift, obliges us not to be wanting, in paying all due Regards to the memory of the Dead, that have been eminently Useful &amp; Services able among us in Publick Capacities, so nei∣ther should we forget to Honour the Living that succeed them in their Characters and Labours. The Israelites make honourable Mention of deceased <HI>Moses,</HI> and pay a due Deference unto succeeding <HI>Joshua.</HI></P>
<P>But our Present work is to Clear and Im∣prove the following</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>It is much to be desired that Civil Rulers may have much of the Presence of GOD with them.</HI></P>
<P>This was it upon which the <HI>Israelites</HI> so highly Valued <HI>Moses;</HI> and it seems to have been a prospect of this that made them so chearful and full in their Promises unto <HI>Joshua.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That they may be well fitted for the Business of Government;</HI> which calls for no small Ac∣complishments to reach the Ends thereof▪ Which as they are of grand Importance unto
<PB N="7" REF="002741_0006_0FE61D7955C12338"/>
the Children of men, so they are not easily attained. The flourishing of <HI>Piety</HI> &amp; <HI>Reli∣gion;</HI> the flowing &amp; free course of <HI>Righteous∣ness;</HI> the <HI>Peace</HI> &amp; <HI>Tranquility</HI> of Civil Societies and the <HI>Publick Good</HI> in all these, are the things to be atcheived by Civil Government and should be the fixed Aims, and steady Views of all in Authority<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 2.</NOTE>. And the Bonds whereby Societies are held together, the Cases whereby they are weakned in any of these great Interests, and the Remedies whereby they are restored, are things that lie out of the sight and reach of Ordinary Abilities. It must be the Presence of GOD in an Un∣common measure that must make men meet for such Undertakings. We should all be <HI>Pares Negotiis,</HI> a Match for our Work. And therefore when God did more immediately call any to serve Himself and their Genera∣tions in such a way, either they were men whom He had before prepared by suitable Endowments for such Work, as He did <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Joshua,</HI> or He did then more immediately Gift them to His Service; as in <HI>Saul'</HI>s case, to whom, after he was anointed by <HI>Samuel</HI> to be Captain over God's Inheritance, GOD gave another heart, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10 9 Not a new heart, but a <HI>Princely spirit</HI> &amp; Endowments for Go∣vernment▪
<PB N="8" REF="002741_0007_0FE61D795FE93850"/>
And when God gives leave to us to choose Rulers for our selves, He limits our Choice to such as He hath already Gifted &amp; Prepared. Agreeable therefore to the Divine Will, was the Counsel of <HI>Jethro</HI> to <HI>Moses, Exod.</HI> 18. 21. That he should provide out of all the People, able men, such as feared God, acted truly &amp; hated Covetousness, and set them over the People. And when God, pursuant to this Counsel by <HI>Jethro,</HI> gave <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> for his Assistance, He or∣dered <HI>Moses,</HI> (Numb. 11. 16.) to gather unto him Seventy men of the Elders of <HI>Israel,</HI> whom he knew to be the Elders of the Peo∣ple: <HI>To select out of the Elders of Israel Seventy of the most approved Abilities,</HI> to help him bear his Burden. And because the Circumstan∣ces of <HI>Israel</HI> were Extraordinary in the Wil∣derness, therefore a peculiar Presence of God is granted to them, Ver. 18 <HI>I will take of the spirit that is upon Thee, and put it upon them.</HI> God would shew the spirit of <HI>Moses</HI> with them, as he did His work: Not that the Gift of the Spirit was at all diminished in <HI>Moses;</HI> but a like Prophetick Spirit &amp; Infalli∣ble Conduct afforded unto the <HI>Seventy,</HI> which had been before peculiar unto <HI>Moses</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od▪</HI> in Loc.</NOTE>. What these Abilities are which are the Gifts of the
<PB N="9" REF="002741_0007_0FE61D795FE93850"/>
God of all Grace, for the Benefit of a People, in them that bear Rule, hath been shewn by others on these Occasions, to which I refer you.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That they may be well spirited to their Work.</HI> And indeed this is of main Consideration in this affair, that such as are concerned in the Government of a People, should have a kind∣ly disposition to the Duties of it. It is the Apostle's Command, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 11. That we be not slothful in Business, <HI>but</HI> fervent in spirit serving the Lord. And our Zeal should bear a proportion to the Service we have to do for GOD. Civil Rulers then should be men warmly affected to the Pub∣lick Good, and in good earnest to approve themselves Benefactors to mankind. It is for this end Government is ordained. Rom. 13. 4. <HI>He is the minister of God to thee for good.</HI> And the Ruler, whose heart is right with God, will set himself to devise liberal things for the good of a People; and spare no Pains, nor leave any Stone unturned to advance the Publick Interest. He will labour to draw others into the Paths of Vertue &amp; Righte∣ousness, by going before them in a bright Example; and will be very careful that there be nothing in his Conversation that may be a Stumbling-block to others, or an occasion of Sin. If he have Power thereunto, he will
<PB N="10" REF="002741_0008_0FE61D842855F938"/>
gladly help forward the Enacting of good Laws, however he will do what in him lies, to keep up the Credit of such good Laws as are Enacted for the Banishing Wickedness out of the Land, and the Advancing Righ∣teousness and Religion, that they may not Sink into Contempt and become Enervated. He will Faithfully Execute Judgment on Transgressors, and in his Zeal will say with upright David, Psal. 101. 8. <HI>I will Early de∣stroy all the Wicked of the Land: that I may cut off all Wicked doers from the City of the Lord.</HI> His Influences on others will be not a little conducive to their good Behaviour. Much Good will be done by him thro' his Counte∣nancing, and Bestowing marks of his Favour, on them that are found in the ways of well doing. And his frowns will weaken the hands of the Wicked, that they may turn from their Evil way. He will not only En∣deavour to do Good himself, but will help forward and encourage others in being Pub∣lickly Serviceable. So did <HI>Hezekiah</HI> who spake Comfortably to the <HI>Levites</HI> that taught the good Knowledge of the LORD. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 30. 22.</P>
<P>But without this Zeal of how little Bene∣fit are they like to be to the World, whate∣ver be their Ability's or Authority. Of what worth is a Talent that is wrapt up in a
<PB N="11" REF="002741_0008_0FE61D842855F938"/>
Napkin. Such will be in Effect but meer Titular Rulers, but Idol-gods, that have Eyes but see not the faults of Men, Ears but hear not the cry of the Poor, Mouths but speak not for the relief of the Oppressed in the gate, and Hands but revenge not the wrongs done by Transgressors. Indeed the greatest defect of Men in every Station and of every Degree lies here, That they have more Abi∣lity than Heart to their Duty. What thro' the Power of Lusts within, and the many Temptations that are without, there is much of that Good neglected &amp; goes undone that we are both fitted for and called to do.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To Support them under the burden of Go∣vernment.</HI> Which is not a matter of meer Honour, Pleasure and Profit, (as some seem vainly to Dream; and therefore Ignorantly envy others their preferments,) but an Im∣ployment full of Labour and Travel, Care and Solicitude, Expence and Charge, Ha∣zard and Danger, &amp; therefore calls for much of the Divine Presence Assistance &amp; Support under the presence of it. <HI>David</HI> compares the managing of Government to the <HI>bearing up</HI> the Pillars of the Earth. <HI>Psal.</HI> 75. 3. And surely he had need to have his Shoulders well strengthened, that must stand under such a Weight. <HI>Moses</HI> although a Mighty Man &amp; beyond Compare, yet Groaned under this
<PB N="12" REF="002741_0009_0FE61D843040C880"/>
burden. <HI>Num.</HI> 11. 14, 15. <HI>I am not able to bear all this People alone, because it is too Heavy for me. And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found Favour in thy Sight; and let me not see my Wretchedness.</HI> It is said that <HI>Domesthenes,</HI> after a long Go∣vernment in the Common Wealth, confes∣sed to his Friends, that if in the beginning, the choice had been given him of the Go∣vernment, or of his Grave, if he could have foreseen the Evils, the Terrors, the Calum∣nies, the Envies, the Contentions, the Dan∣gers that Men in such Capacity's usually meet with, he would, with much Alacrity have Posted on to his Sepulchre rather than to his Greatness<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Humane Prudence.</HI></NOTE>. And surely none ever well applyed themselves to the work but they felt the weight. Besides the difficulties that attend their work through the cunning Craft and unmanageable Spirit of some offenders▪ And their Sufferings often times in their personal Interest while they attend the Pub∣lick affairs, they frequently meet with Inju∣ries, Indignity's and Various abuses that are no small Tryals to them. There are usually Envious Persons that look with an Evil Eye at their Greatness: And with the Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> that despised Saul, will say,
<PB N="13" REF="002741_0009_0FE61D843040C880"/>
<HI>How shall these men save us?</HI> There will be such as <HI>despise Dominion,</HI> &amp; <HI>speak evil of Digni∣ties:</HI> There will be <HI>Murmurers &amp; Complainers,</HI> that will spread &amp; take up <HI>false Reports,</HI> and fill the world with Lies, Misrepresentations &amp; Slanders: There will be Ambitious men of <HI>aspiring spirits,</HI> that will flatter the people, &amp; traduce the Government of them that Rule, as <HI>Absalom</HI> did his Fathers, 2 Sam. 15. 3, 4.—<HI>There is no man deputed of the King to hear thee,</HI>—<HI>Oh! That I were made Judge in the Land, that every man which hath any Suit or Cause, might come unto me, and I would do him Justice</HI> And as <HI>Korah</HI> did <HI>Moses'</HI>s, Numb. 16. 3. <HI>Ye</HI> [Moses &amp; Aaron] <HI>take too much upon you, seeing all the Congregation are holy every one of them:</HI> And you ought not therefore thus to usurp Domination over them: And had doubtless made greater Confusion in Israel, had not the Glorious GOD seasona∣bly interposed his own Authority for the protection of <HI>Moses</HI> and the safety of the People. And in times of Degeneracy and Distress, the Clamours of the People are wont to be thrown against the Rulers, as if they were the Authors of all their Calamities &amp; Sufferings. Nor is it to be expected that the <HI>Earthly Gods</HI> should meet with better Treat∣ment from impatient Men, than the <HI>Great GOD of Heaven;</HI> whom they are wont
<PB N="14" REF="002741_0010_0FE61D862201CFE0"/>
at such a time, more directly or more indi∣rectly, by Thoughts or Words or Actions, or all of them to Reproach and Blaspheme. Isa. 8. 21. <HI>And they shall Pass through it</HI> [the Land] <HI>hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hun∣gry, they shall fret themselves, and Curse their King and their God and look upward.</HI> How great a Favour is it to a People, when GOD gives them Rulers, like <HI>Moses,</HI> that with a Generous Patience &amp; Compassionate Meek∣ness, bear with their frowardness and carry them in their Arms.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>To Prosper their Endeavours for the Pub∣lick good.</HI> It is not the Wisdom of the Wise, nor the Counsel of the Prudent, nor the Politicks of States-men can raise a Common Wealth or make one Flourish. The Buil∣ders of <HI>Babel</HI> (probably <HI>Nimrod</HI> &amp; his Com∣plices) are a pregnant Instance of this. They Projected with themselves to lay the Foun∣dation of an Universal Empire, whose head should be <HI>Babylon,</HI> which they would build with a very high Tower to command and defend it; Their Scheme was well laid, they were Unanimous in their design, &amp; all things concurred to the accomplishing their Pur∣pose. In so much that God said, Gen. 11. 6.—<HI>Now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</HI> Only GOD
<PB N="15" REF="002741_0010_0FE61D82201CEF0"/>
was not with them to Succeed their Endea∣vours; but frowned upon their Enterprize, and so it fell to the ground. <HI>Edom</HI> thought to have Built his desolate Places when he was impoverished, but he reckoned without his host; for what faith the Lord of Hosts? <HI>They shall build, but I will throw down,</HI> Mal. 1 4.</P>
<P>If the designs be never so Pious, and they that form them be very Zealous too, yet without this, their Labour will be all spent for nought and in vain A work of Refor∣mation will stick in the Birth, if God give not strength to bring forth. The high Places, where the People worshipped contrary to the Divine Commandment, were not taken away in the Days of <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI> that Re∣forming Prince; because <HI>the Lord had not pre∣pared the hearts of the People</HI> (for the Prepa∣ration of the heart is from the Lord) <HI>to the God of their Fathers,</HI> 2 Chron. 20. 33. Tho' this came to pass thro' the fault of the Peo∣ple: God denying them His Grace because of their Neglects and Transgressions; and therefore it is justly charged upon them as their Crime, That they had not prepared their Hearts to return to GOD.</P>
<P>Without this, they can be no Safety nor Protection to a People, nor prevent impend∣ing Calamities from breaking in upon them. Psal. 127. 1 <HI>Except the LORD keep the City, the
<PB N="16" REF="002741_0011_0FE61D8629B62D48"/>
Watchmen waketh but in vain. Moses</HI> was so sensible of the Necessity of the Divine Pre∣sence, in order unto any good Fruit of his care and pains for <HI>Israel,</HI> that he dare not move one step without it: Exod. 33. 15. <HI>If thy Presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now that we Apply this Truth, and it shall be by way of EXHORTATION, and that both to Rulers and Ruled.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Rulers, even to all that are in Authority.</HI> And the Exhortation, Honourable, Wor∣shipful and Highly Esteemed, that we bring you this day, is, <HI>That you use your best Endea∣vours to engage the Presence of GOD with you to all the aforementioned Purposes.</HI> This will be no less Conducive to your Honour, Interest and Comfort, than to the Weal of this Peo∣ple. It is this must make you truely Valu∣able and Useful; while such as are without it, are only Cyphers set in a Figures place.

What a Pity is it that any part of a short and uncertain Time should fail of being filled with doing Good.

(1) <HI>Such as would enjoy the Presence of GOD in Civil Publick Capacity's, must be Preferred by GOD, and not be self Promoters.</HI> It may Rea∣sonably be Expected that GOD will own and Bless Men in that Service for himself, which he Calls them to. This is our En∣couragement against all our Pears arising from a sense either of our own Weakness, or the greatness of Publick Work, that GOD who calls and improveth us, is able to Sup∣ply us with all needed Strength, &amp; to carry on his own Purposes by his own Instru∣ments. This was <HI>Joshua'</HI>s case. The GOD of Israel made him Captain over his Inhe∣ritance, and he never forsook him but Ac∣complished the Settlement of Israel in the Land of Canaan by his Hand. But if Men seek their own Advancement, and lay Plots for their own Promotion, and have a great hand in their own Preferments, what can be Expected but that GOD should leave them to themselves. Self Promotion is ve∣ry Displeasing to GOD, who never wants Instruments for his own Work, and would have no Man rush into his Service or run of his Errand before he is sent When our LORD JESUS saw the Pharisee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> chusing for themselves the Chief rooms at a Feast, he reproved them. <HI>Luk.</HI> 14. 7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And on that occasion gave Documents of Modesty

<P>And altho' GOD be Sovereign of His Fa∣vours, and dispense them unto whom and when He will; Nevertheless there are Courses for us to take, that lead to our good herein, and we may contribute much to this matter.

Covetousness will Disaffect you to such as would carry on the Publick Good to the best Advan∣tage, lest they should put you to some Charge to maintain good Designs.

But let us follow the guidance of Providence in improving those in His Service He hath best fitted for His Work.
