<HEAD>A DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy and honored Friends and Brothers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GREAT is the pleasure with which I embrace the opportunity that your kind invitation has given me of addressing myself to you this day—a day which, I trust, will ever be joyfully remembered by you all;—a day in which, by the Installation of the Master and other Officers of a Lodge of Ma∣sons in this city, the influence of that vene∣rable fraternity will be extended, and the bands of mutual love and good-will strength∣ened among them;—A day in which the presence of so many Brothers from the
<PB N="6" REF="029481_0005_0FE13C3372836580"/>
neighboring Lodges met together to culti∣vate the principles of mutual love, and spread its happy influence, must cheer the heart and exhilarate the spirits of every humane man.</P>
<P>BOTH as a Minister of that Gospel which proclaimeth peace and good-will to man∣kind, and as one of the common brother∣hood of men, I feel myself deeply interest∣ed in the honor, prosperity, and happiness of every Society, whose object is the peace, order, and welfare of the human race; and whose aim is the establishment and cultiva∣tion of unity, brotherly love, and benevolence among its several branches.</P>
<P>THIS is the professed design of your soci∣ety. It considers the helplessness of the in∣fantine state of man, the wants and necessi∣ties of his mature age, the numberless evils attendant on his declining years, as so many proofs that "it is not good for man to be a∣lone"—that in a solitary, unconnected state, <HI>He could not subsist,</HI> or could not subsist with safety and satisfaction to himself.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="029481_0006_0FE13C3921A5FF98"/>
ANOTHER proof that man was made for so∣ciety arises from the tender feelings of which his heart is susceptible; of which, indeed, without violence and often repeated efforts it cannot be divested; from the sympathetic anguish which rises in it at the distresses of others; from the thrillings of joy and glad∣ness with which it is delighted by the pros∣pect of human happiness; from the soft e∣motions and extacy of pleasure which spring from the reciprocal offices of friendship and love.—These all proclaim that God intend∣ed man for society—that every individual of the human race should be a help and com∣fort to every other.</P>
<P>To give full energy to these happy princi∣ples of human nature, and carry them to their utmost effect, to cultivate natural know∣ledge and acquired arts, and to disseminate their principles and improvements for the comfort and benefit of man, as well as to har∣monize the soul, and bring the tender affec∣tions of his nature into action, is the profes∣sed purpose of the Masonic institution. It commences its origin from the origin of man,
<PB N="8" REF="029481_0007_0FE13C3C8E776A38"/>
because, from his origin, man hath ever wan∣ted the advantage of knowledge, and arts, and humane affections to ensure and make perfect the happiness of social life. Through various forms and degrees of refinement it hath hitherto subsisted in the world, some∣times clouded in obscurity, and sometimes, shining in splendor; now distressed by perse∣cution and oppression, then cherished by the favor of the world and the countenance of great men and princes. The former state a∣rose from the ignorance and the prejudices of narrow-minded men, the latter from the im∣provement of the human mind by knowledge and liberality of sentiment.</P>
<P>BUT whatever was its outward condition in the world, whether persecuted or cherish∣ed, Masonry was still the same; still it labor∣ed to promote the peace and harmony of the world, by cultivating the principles of bene∣volence and love; still it sought the happi∣ness of men, by advancing the knowledge of Architecture, Agriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce; still it endeavored to promote the prosperity of social life, by restraining the tempers and enlivening the affections which
<PB N="9" REF="029481_0008_0FE13C428A6725A0"/>
could either retard or advance it. Human happiness was its object, and that object it kept ever in view. Through evil report and good, it still pursued it. Though sometimes disappointed of its aim, it renewed its at∣tempts: Though baffled by human infirmi∣ty, and possibly by the fault and ill conduct of particular members, it pursued its point, it repeated its efforts, its object was still before it, still the end of its warmest wishes, of its most zealous endeavors.</P>
<P>EXACTLY does the Masonic institution in this respect, coincide with the morality of that holy religion, to the profession of which the mercy of God hath called us. To establish this assertion, I recommend to your attention the exhortation of St. Paul, which I purpose for the subject of my present discourse. It is recorded in
<Q><BIBL>HEB. XIII. 1.</BIBL>
LET BROTHERLY LOVE CONTINUE.</Q></P>
<P>I HAVE the rather chosen this text because it will give me the opportunity of contribu∣ting my endeavors to promote the good pur∣poses of your Society and the end of this day's
<PB N="10" REF="029481_0009_0FE13C463A3B3618"/>
solemnity, by enforcing the precepts and spi∣rit of that amiable and divine Religion which we profess, respecting brotherly love and be∣nevolence—a principle which, did it engage the hearts, and regulate the actions of men, would calm all their discordant passions and partial views, and bind them together, as strong cement binds together the materials of a building, which without it would part and fall asunder.</P>
<P>THIS religion, I trust, is not only ours by profession, but by its being the ruling prin∣ciple in our hearts; and that it will bring every thought and design, every temper and passion in obedience to its divine precepts. Its importance demands our utmost attention; and that attention will convince us that Chri∣stianity furnishes mankind with the best phi∣losophy, and most perfect institutions of life; that it contains not only the best system of moral duties that is extant, but, in truth, the only system that is fully adapted to the nature and condition of man in this world; being exactly squared to his circumstances, and le∣velled to his capacity; laying the sure foun∣dation for his happiness; tending to raise
<PB N="11" REF="029481_0010_0FE13C4C12E157F0"/>
his powers and faculties to their highest perfection, to cement together the whole brotherhood of men, and build them up an edifice of love, supported by the two grand pillars of virtue and holiness, the light and strength of the world.</P>
<P>THE precepts of this religion which enjoin love and charity are very numerous, and ex∣pressed in the strongest and plainest terms: And reason, as well as experience, evinces the necessity of these precepts, to procure and preserve the happiness of the human species. Born in weakness and ignorance, entirely de∣pendant on the care and protection of others; how soon must man fall a prey to those num∣berless evils which surround him, did not the tenderness of love, and sympathy of affection prevent it? And as he grows up to more ma∣ture age, he still continues indebted to the same amiable principles for almost all his en∣joyments. Bodily strength comes too late to protect him against injuries, and experience comes too late to point out the road to hap∣piness. He must depend on the protection and instruction of others; and nothing but love and affection can excite others to afford
<PB N="12" REF="029481_0011_0FE13C5126173498"/>
this protection, or give this instruction. And in his best estate, when bodily strength is perfected; when reason has come to matu∣rity, and instruction and experience supply their utmost help, the greater part of his happiness must arise from the affectionate and social tendencies of his nature.</P>
<P>LOOK at the malignant and baneful pas∣sions and tempers with which his nature is now unhappily debased, and you will be immediately convinced of the truth of what I have said. Malice, and revenge, and ill-na∣ture carry their own torment with them.—They <HI>may,</HI> and they probably <HI>will,</HI> vex, and and fret and torment those against whom they are exerted: But, at the same time, they <HI>must</HI> torment the bosom which indulges them; and, while they prevail, render it incapable of any rational enjoyment. To have menti∣oned this matter is enough: It carries its own evidence along with it, and needs no elaborate proof to convince us of its reality. We know that ill-nature and malice make those who indulge them miserable in themselves, and odious to all around them. And we know that the benign and social propensities of our
<PB N="13" REF="029481_0012_0FE13C5675BAD260"/>
nature give pleasure in their exercise, and en∣sure happiness wherever they are practised.</P>
<P>IN this view, then, as well as in all other views, the Christian Religion deserves our best regards. It teaches us to consider mankind as one common brotherhood—the children of the same parent, and members of the same family—allied to each other by partaking of the same nature, and being subject to the same necessities and infirmities: And it directs us to seek and promote their happiness by all the means that shall be in our power; to comfort the afflicted, to protect the weak, to relieve the oppressed, to support the indigent, to in∣struct the ignorant, to administer, in short, to the various necessities of mankind, as God shall bless us with ability and opportunity.—It forbids all malevolent designs and intenti∣ons, as well as the open and avowed acts of malice; and it carries the principle of love and charity so high, as to require the forgive∣ness of real injuries, and the suppression of even our just anger.</P>
<P>ALL the writers of the New Testament,
<PB N="14" REF="029481_0013_0FE13C59D0546F68"/>
however they may vary in the enumeration of the other virtues, and in the encomiums they bestow upon them, are unanimous in gi∣ving this of brotherly love the preference; making it pre-eminent in its station, in its in∣fluence, and excellency above them all.</P>
<P>THE adorable Jesus, the great lover of men, declares that command of God, which enjoins us to love our neighbor as ourselves, to be e∣qual to that great command which requires us to love the Lord our God with all our hearts; and says, that on these two command∣ments, the love of God and man, all the Law and the Prophets do hang: Thereby more than intimating to us, that the foundation of all <HI>moral</HI> precepts, lies in this love of God and man; and that nothing in morality has any virtue or real excellency in it, but as it is de∣ducible from, or may be referred to one or o∣ther of these principles.</P>
<P>ST. James calls this law which commands the love of our neighbor, the <HI>Royal Law;</HI> thereby declaring its excellency and pre-emi∣nence: And assures us that the whole train of social duties is fulfilled by fulfilling this law, <HI>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="029481_0014_0FE13C631B8ECF40"/>
ST. Paul represents Love to others as a debt which, though due to all, can never be paid so as to cancel its obligation, and declares, in expressions similar to those of St. James, that the whole law, or obligation of duty, which one man owes to another, is fulfilled by ob∣serving this one precept, <HI>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</HI> And in the conclusion of his epistle to the Hebrews, the strong sense he had of it returns upon his mind with such force, that he could not help mentioning it, as necessary to complete the Christian character, <HI>Let brotherly love continue.</HI> He saith nothing of the commencement of it. It already sub∣sisted among Christians. Christians they could not be without it—it was woven into their religion, and made a part of it. Their duty, therefore, required them to nourish it, to sup∣port and maintain it, to regulate their hearts and actions by it, to pursue it through all its branches, and follow wherever it led them. It was one of the fruits of the Spirit of God, and at no rate to be neglected.</P>
<P>FROM the Spirit of God it hath descended and become the professed principle of the Ma∣sonic
<PB N="16" REF="029481_0015_0FE13C69218D9D68"/>
fraternity: For wherever the principle of brotherly love is, wherever it resides and governs the passions and actions of men, there is the Spirit of God; for <HI>God is love;</HI> and "there is none good but one, that is God."</P>
<P>BE this love then the Line which directs your conduct, the Square by which to form the rectitude of your principles and actions, the Plummet to try their uprightness, the Le∣vel to ascertain their conformity to the Al∣mighty Architect; and let its Compass em∣brace the whole human race. Love hath ever distinguished your fraternity: Let, therefore, brotherly love continue. It will give reputa∣tion to your Society, stability to the Lodge this day installed, and make it an ornament to the city in which we live. Love to others, a desire to promote their happiness will ensure respect. Real worth alone can acquire real dignity, and propriety of conduct only can se∣cure respect, either to individuals, or to bodies of men.</P>
<P>I HAVE thought it needless to take up your time in explaining what is meant by <HI>brotherly love.</HI> The feelings of your own hearts will do
<PB N="17" REF="029481_0016_0FE13C69218D9D68"/>
that better than the most elaborate descripti∣on. Let us only remember that <HI>every</HI> man is our brother, being all the children of the same common parent, God Almighty, and the ex∣tent of the duty will be immediately percei∣ved. Only consider the common wants and necessities of this brotherhood—that its hap∣piness can no otherwise be promoted, and the variety of evils to which it is exposed no oth∣erwise prevented than by loving one another, and the reasonableness of the duty will be clearly seen. Only reflect, that to love one another, to delight in doing good to all, to cultivate the tender, benign, and social pro∣pensities of our nature, is the command of our Creator, and the obligation of the duty will be strongly felt. Only recollect, that God hath declared him who hateth his brother to be a murderer, and that he must have his por∣tion with apostate spirits—that He, God him∣self is the essence of love; and that he who loves his brother resembles his Creator, and shall enjoy everlasting felicity with him in hea∣ven, and the motives to the practice of the duty will be too forcible for an ingenuous mind to resist.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="029481_0017_0FE13C6CF8FD1C80"/>
HOW unhappy is it for the world that un∣thinking man attends so little to these consid∣erations! How much of the misery which man endures, how many of the evils under which he constantly groans, might be pre∣vented by cultivating this amiable, this divine quality! Look at the calamities that over∣spread the earth—What we call the evils of nature, sickness and accidents, storms and tem∣pests, thunder and earthquakes, bear no pro∣portion to those evils which the malevolent and baneful passions of men bring on it. War alone hath done more mischief, hath destroy∣ed more of the human race, hath brought more misery into the world, than all of them together. And whence come wars and fight∣ings among men? come they not from their unbridled lusts and malignant passions? How dreadful is the situation! how melancholy the prospect, when brotherhoods of men arm themselves for mutual destruction!</P>
<P>TO have mentioned this horrible state of human depravity is enough to expose its e∣normity. With pleasure I turn from such a theme, to the contemplation of the amiable
<PB N="19" REF="029481_0018_0FE13C731901E6B8"/>
qualities of affection and benevolence, which first founded that brotherhood to which I have, this day, the pleasure of addressing my∣self; and which hath cemented it together, and built it up, an edifice of love, a temple of unity and concord. May God prosper their endeavors to extend the blessings of peace, friendship, love, and knowledge through the world!</P>
<P>IN cultivating this principle you are enga∣ged; a principle on which human happiness must be built. Of this happiness the foun∣dation was laid by God his Creator, when he gave man those tender, benign, and social feel∣ings which are the greatest ornament and high∣est perfection of his nature. To rear the fair fabrick to this perfection; to bring to matu∣rity that seed of salvation which was sown in the hearts of all men, when God said, <HI>The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the ser∣pent,</HI> was the end the Son of God, the adora∣ble Savior of men, had in view, when he took our nature upon him. He therefore went about doing good, cultivating the ten∣der propensities of that nature he had assum∣ed,
<PB N="20" REF="029481_0019_0FE13C789468D698"/>
calling into action all the amities and cha∣rities of the human heart, enforcing them by his precepts, and confirming them by his ex∣ample; making it the very mark and essenti∣al characteristic of his disciples, that they should <HI>love one another.</HI></P>
<P>TO further this blessed disposition, and give it its utmost efficacy, is your professed design; and as, I trust, it has the warmest wishes of your hearts, I trust, also, it will have the ut∣most exertions of your abilities to bring it to perfection. In this business you are workers together with God, and fellow-laborers with Christ and his apostles, and with all good men.</P>
<P>PERMIT me then with the affection of a brother who earnestly wishes your prosperity, as well as with the authority of a minister of the Gospel of peace and good-will to men, whose greatest glory it is to recommend that Gospel to men, and make it effectual to their salvation, to put you in mind of your obliga∣tions in this respect, and earnestly to exhort you, not to be weary in doing good, but to <HI>let brotherly love continue,</HI> and mark all your con∣versation as Christians, as well as Masons.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="029481_0020_0FE13C7DB35B6A48"/>
THE evil propensities of wicked men will, it is true, rise up in opposition; and the ma∣lignant passions of human nature will coun∣teract the benevolent design of your holy re∣ligion, as well as of your particular instituti∣on. But these, by their contrariety, will on∣ly add to the splendor of your glory, and make the virtue of your conduct the more conspic∣uous, while you strive to bring order and peace out of confusion and discord, and to make friendship and love triumphant over en∣mity and malice.</P>
<P>RECOLLECT, therefore, that all the words and actions of men,—the whole tenor and particulars of their lives—are noted by God who made them, and will by him be brought into judgment. Not only so; but their open conduct is viewed and scanned, and judged by their fellow-men; and that they will esteem or disregard the particular Society to which they belong, not only according to the worth of its institutions and regulations, but also according to the conduct of those who are members of it. Of the institutions of Ma∣sonry, it may, I assure myself, be justly asser∣ted,
<PB N="22" REF="029481_0021_0FE13C80DC7946B0"/>
that they are calculated to promote the happiness of the world. Let then the con∣duct of Masons be answerable to them. Let the force of their good institutions appear in their deportment. Let truth and justice, so∣briety and modesty, courtesy and affability, liberality and candor, affection and love, be∣nevolence and charity mark their whole con∣duct, and shew to the world, that they are the faithful servants of the merciful Savior of men, united by particular badges and institu∣tions, to do good to mankind by promoting their happiness. Then shall their fellow-men regard and respect them: God will look with favor upon them and bless them: This tem∣porary life will be closed in the satisfaction of having done good in their generation, and the merit of their Redeemer will carry them to the eternal kingdom of peace and love.</P>
<P>KEEP, therefore, Brethren, the lamp of brotherly love burning bright in your hearts, square all your actions by the eternal rules of equity and just proportion; measure your de∣signs by analogy with that ratio which the lip of truth hath given you, "Whatsoever ye
<PB N="23" REF="029481_0022_0FE13C868D139478"/>
would that others should do to you, do ye e∣ven so to them;" circumscribe all your desires by the compass of duty, and level them by patience to your circumstances: So shall the Lodges of the craft rise in order, beauty, and strength, cemented by the Spirit of the Almighty Architect of nature, who always worketh in and by Love—Jehovah—Trinity of Persons, in Unity of Essence: To whom be ascribed, by men and by angels—by every creature his hand hath formed—Glory, Ho∣nor, Dominion, Praise, Thanksgiving, now and forever.</P>
