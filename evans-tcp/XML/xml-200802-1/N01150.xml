<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Honoured, Reverend, much Respected, and Beloved in the Lord,</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Who am of the Least, the most Unable, and Unworthy of all your Servants in the Lord, am called at this time to Preach before this Great, and Good Assembly, an Assembly of the Chosen People of the Lord: The Choice, the Best, the most Wife, the most Able in the Province; an Assembly, which is yet accounted (notwith∣standing a great Declension and Degeneracy) the most truly Honourable, Venerable, Pious, and Re∣ligious, of any in the <HI>Western World.</HI> This Land was Sown with good Seed, planted with choice Vines, Men generally Vertuous, Pious and Reli∣gious. Religion was their main interest; it was no Worldly design, but meerly on the account of Religion; they came to these remote Ends of the Earth, a vast and howling Wilderness: God sig∣nally owned, and blessed them in their great, and
<PB REF="001369_0003_0FB292B4C10CC4B0"/>
dangerous Undertaking, God was <HI>with them,</HI> and it was well with them. God was a <HI>Wall of fire round about them,</HI> and their glory in the midst of them: No weapons formed against them Prospe∣red; Counsels were turned to Foolishness. <HI>We have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us, what God did for them in their days, How He did drive out the Heathen, and Planted them; they got not the Land in Possession by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm save them.</HI> They were <HI>with God,</HI> and God was with them: They Sought and Served God, God Prospered them: They Sought the Kingdom of God in the first Place; They had the additional Blessings of Heaven, and Earth, Sea and Land: From Small beginnings, in few years they became a Flourishing, and considerable Plan∣tation. But since their days, their Posterity, and Successors have much Degenerated: <HI>As we have increased, so we have Sinned, and Provoked the Lord against us.</HI> We have changed our Ways and In∣terest in great measure; God hath changed his Ways, and dealings towards us. God hath Wit∣nessed against us by variety of Judgments for a long time. We have been Impoverished, brought Low, Afflicted, many evils and troubles have befallen us; especially the <HI>Sword,</HI> a cruel Sword; a Cruel Barbarous Enemy. The Sword God is not wont to draw upon His People when less Chastisements are effectual. Here hath been great Declension: God hath been greatly Pro∣voked; <HI>How is our Gold become dim, and our fine Gold changed?</HI> This is matter of Lamentation!
<PB REF="001369_0004_0FB293458CADC9E0"/>
and that which is greater, We are still Declining, notwithstanding all Means used to prevent and to reduce.</P>
<P>I shall therefore endeavour to apply my self in such manner, as I judge most suitable to a People so circumstanced. <HI>Deo annuente, et adju∣vante.</HI> God needeth no Instruments: He can work with them, or without them, as in plea∣seth Him. The <HI>best</HI> can do nothing <HI>without</HI> God; the <HI>weakest</HI> can do much <HI>with</HI> God. God's Strength is made perfect in Weakness, 1 Cor. 3.7. <HI>He that planteth is not any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.</HI></P>
<P>I would not offend any Person, nor offer any thing, but what might be agreeable to all; yet to please all I account a thing next to impossi∣ble; <HI>Quot Capita tot Sensus. Omnes non idem Sapiunt.</HI> I desire not the Praise of Men, I desire to please God above all: I desire God may give me His Grace so to do. Give what He may accept and accept what He gives.</P>
<P>NOW may it please Your EXCELLENCY, and this Honourable Assembly; the place of Scrip∣ture I have taken for the Subject of our present Discourse, you have in,</P>
<Q><BIBL>Numbers XIV.II.</BIBL>
And the Lord said unto Moses, How long will this People provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me? —</Q>
<P><PB REF="001369_0005_0FB29346F9517258"/>THIS Book is called by the Hebrews, <HI>Vajedabber,</HI> from the first words: And (the Lord) <HI>Said.</HI> Some-times <HI>Bemidbar,</HI> that is, <HI>In the Wilderness,</HI> where these things were acted. According to the Greek Title, it is called <HI>Numbers</HI>; so called from the many Numbrings recorded in the Book. The most re∣markable Numbring we have in <HI>Numb.</HI> 1.1, 2, 3. Where God commandeth Moses, <HI>On the first day of the second Month, in the second year after they were come cut of the Land of Egypt, to Take the Sum of all the Congregation of Israel: from twenty year old and upward, that were able to go forth to War.</HI> Except the Levites, <HI>v.</HI> 47. Twenty years old: [<HI>Heb.</HI>] a Son of twenty, entring into, or beginning to be twenty. The total Sum we have, <HI>v.</HI> 46. <HI>Six hun∣dred thousand and three thousand, and five hundred and fifty.</HI> A wonderful increase of Seventy Souls in such a time. A reward of Faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.11, 12. <HI>Through faith Sarah received strength to conceive, therefore there sprang even from one, so many as the Stars of the Skie for multitude, and as the Sand of the Sea Shore in∣numerable. Balaam</HI> beholds them with admiration, <HI>Numb.</HI> 23.10. <HI>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and number the fourth part of Israel.</HI> 'Tis of awful con∣sideration, that God consumed this great body of People (all but two, <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Joshua</HI>) in His Wrath. Where Note, That a People for whom God hath done great things, wrought wonders, may after by their Ingratitude and Disobedience provoke God to Destroy them. Jude <HI>v.5. I will
<PB REF="001369_0006_0FB2934878F28D60"/>
put you in remembrance, how the Lord having saved his People out of Egypt, afterward destroyed them.</HI> The Contents of this Book are partly <HI>Doctrinal,</HI> partly <HI>Historical</HI>: The Doctrinal part contains ad∣ditions, explanations of sundry Laws, Moral, Ju∣dicial, mostly Ceremonial. The Historical part containeth the most remarkable things, the Chil∣dren of Israel did, or suffered in the Desert, by the space of Thirty-nine years: Dangers, Delive∣rances, Troubles, Travels, Provocations, Punish∣ments. In the Fourteenth Chapter we have re∣corded, a Rebellion that did consummate their Provocation, and compleat their Sin, and pro∣cured their utter Destruction. God will bear no longer: He will utterly consume them; there is no remedy. <HI>Verse 28. Say unto them, as I live saith the Lord, their Carcases shall fall in the Wilderness.</HI> Verse 35. <HI>In the Wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</HI> God minds that this is now the Tenth time, v. 22. <HI>They have tempted me now these ten times.</HI> God remembers, though men forget. Ten is sometimes put for many: <HI>Numerus certus pro incerto.</HI> But here it may be taken properly, for ten times. 1. At the Red-Sea, Exod. 14.11, 12.2. At Marah, <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.23, 24. Again in the Wil∣derness of Sin, Exod. 16.2. Then twice about Manna, Exod. 16.20, 27, 28. After at Rephidim, <HI>Exod.</HI> 17. Then by the Calf at Horeb, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32. At <HI>Taborah, Numb.</HI> 11.1. Again at <HI>Kebroth Hatta∣avah, Numb.</HI> 11.4. Now the tenth time in <HI>Pharan.</HI> Of this provocation, we have,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Cause, and Occasion of it; <HI>viz.</HI> An evil
<PB REF="001369_0007_0FB2934A5BED3738"/>
report brought of the Promised Land by the in∣credulous Spies, <HI>Numb.</HI> 13.32. <HI>It is a Land that eat∣eth up the Inhabitants thereof, the People we saw in it, are men of great Stature. There we saw the giants, and the Sons of Anak, that came of giants: we were in our own sight as grashoppers, so we were in their sight.</HI> We are not able to go up against the People, for they are stronger than we.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Rebellion. <HI>Chap.</HI> 14.1.—4. (1.) An ante∣cedent, v. 1. <HI>All the Congregation lifted up their voice and cryed, and the People wept that night.</HI> [<HI>Heb.</HI>] in, or through that Night. [<HI>Greek</HI>] that whole Night. This Lamentation was a Bitter fruit of their Unbe∣lief. They believe not GOD that promised the Land: They believe not Caleb, that tells them o∣therwise, <HI>Numb.</HI> 13.30. <HI>Let us go up at once, and possess it, for we are able to over-come.</HI> Caleb spake as was in his heart, <HI>Josh.</HI> 14.7. They believe not <HI>Jo∣shua</HI> and <HI>Caleb, Numb.</HI> 14.6.—9. <HI>The Land is an ex∣ceeding good Land: a Land flowing with Milk &amp; Honey. Only rebel ye not against the Lord, neither fear ye the People, for they are bread for us: Their defence is departed from them, the Lord is with us: fear them not.</HI> (2.) The Rebellion and Provocation. 2, 3, 4. verses. <HI>All the Children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said, would God we had dyed in Egypt, in the Wilder∣ness. Wherefore hath God brought us into this Land to fall by the Sword. Let us make us a Captain: Let us return into Egypt.</HI> But alas! how should they Live in the barren desert? how should they get thither? Would God work more Wonders for such Rebels?
<PB REF="001369_0008_0FB2934C33534070"/>
Verse 10. <HI>All the Congregation had Stone them with Stones.</HI> They had almost done the like to Moses, <HI>Exod.</HI> 17.4. They after Stoned the Prophets, —Killed them. Here see what good Men may meet with from an evil Murmuring People. Think it not Strange to see it. No wonder they carry themselves so to good Men, that so do to the good GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Consequents of it, in the following Verses: God is Highly provoked; God threaten∣eth present destruction. By Moses's intercession they are spared as to that, v. 13.—20. Yet they shall not see the Land, they shall bear their iniquity till they be consumed. They that brought the evil report died of the Plague before the Lord. <HI>As I Live saith the Lord,</HI> the Earth shall be filled with the Glory of the Lord. Another Consequent you have in the Words of the Text; which are a great complaint God makes to Moses, of the People, they are also Minatory. In the Text, v. 11. (1.) The party complaining, GOD: the God of Israel; God that brought them out of the Land of Egypt. (2.) The Object complained to, <HI>Moses.</HI> Here God acts with Moses, as a Man in trouble would do with his Friend; make known his mind and grievances to him. (3.) The Subject com∣plain'd of: <HI>This People.</HI> This People in way of In∣dignation and Aversation: not <HI>My People,</HI> as some∣times. (4.) The Matter of the complaint. 1. They Provoke Me; they Provok'd long: <HI>How long will This People Prevoke</HI>? Despise, Provoke contemptu∣ously. 2. They believe not Me; [<HI>Greek] In Me:
<PB REF="001369_0009_0FB2934E935EE0A8"/>
[Chald.] My Word.</HI> This their Unbelief was the cause of their Rebellion, and so of their ruin and destruction. For brevity I shall take up but one Doctrinal Conclusion, which is all I shall make use of.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> That Unbelief is a Great Evil, and a cause of those Evils, and Provocations, where∣by Persons Provoke the Almighty God to Wrath against them, to their Destruction.</P>
<P>This we see here. Thus it was with the Chil∣dren of Israel, in the Wilderness. This Moses a∣gain mentioneth, Deut. 1.32. <HI>You did not believe the Lord your God: And the Lord was Wrath, and Swear, saying, There is not one of this evil Congregation shall see the good Land.</HI> The Apostle, Heb. 3.18. <HI>To whom Swear be they should not enter, but to them that believ∣ed not.</HI> Thus it was with their Posterity afterward, 2 King. 17.14. <HI>God testifyed against Israel and against Judah, by all his Prophets, saying, Turn ye from your Evil ways; but they would not bear, but hardened their Necks like their Fathers that did not believe in the Lord their God.</HI> Therefore the Lord removed them out of his fight, rejected all the Seed of Israel; deli∣vered them into the hands of Spoilers. Israel was carryed out of their own Land, into the Land of Assyria to this day. Thus with the Jews, Rom. 11.20. <HI>Because of Unbelief they were broken off.</HI> Thus with the old World. Unbelief brought the Uni∣versal deluge, 1 Pet. 3.19. <HI>By which he Preached to the Spirits in Prison</HI>; which were disobedient in
<PB REF="001369_0010_0FB2935008B45138"/>
the days of <HI>Noah.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Unbelieving. Un∣belief was the door let in Sin, Death and Sorrow into the World. Satan himself tempted Eve to Unbelief, Gen. 3.4. <HI>Ye shall not surely dye.</HI> Satan was harken'd to. God was not believed, Gen. 2.17. <HI>In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</HI> So the transgression was committed; the forbid∣den fruit eaten; the Glory departed; Man fallen. All Mankind, all of Man, every Man. Man is not what he was: was not what he is: He was once glorious: <HI>Crowned with Glory and Honour,</HI> Psal. 8.5. Now filthy and abominable. Job 15.16. <HI>There is none that doeth good, no not one,</HI> Rom. 3.10. &amp;c. Man was once happy, blessed: Now under Wrath, cursed, miserable. Man was God's Image: Sin is Man's Image: Misery Sin's Image. Man is God's Creature: Sin is Man's Creature: Misery Sin's Creature. <HI>Unbelief</HI> was the door that let in Sin, and Misery into the World; and it is Unbelief that now Perpetuates it. Unbelief is dishonorable to God; destructive to Man: Departeth from God, leads to Sin, and rebellion against God: Keeps Men Obstinate in Sin, Perpetuates Sin; and so the bitter fruits of Sin, Sorrows and Miseries.</P>
<P><HI>But more Particularly,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Unbelief departs from God, Duty and Obe∣dience: Faith Obeyeth, Unbelief disobeys.</P>
<P N="2">2. Unbelief carries men to Sin, any Sin, all Sin. It is a fruitful Mother of a World of transgressions. It casts off the fear of God: Where there is no fear of God, there is no Conscience of Sin. No Con∣science
<PB REF="001369_0011_0FB2935173F888F0"/>
of Sin, what Sin is it men will not com∣mit? The Apostle having set down a Catalogue of Sins, concludeth with this as a cause of all the rest; <HI>There is no fear of God before their Eyes,</HI> Rom. 3.18. Unbelief defileth the heart, blinds the mind, feareth the Conscience; to Mans Natural, it addeth a contracted Hardness, that they become past feeling, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.13.</P>
<P N="3">3. It holds men obstinate in Sin, that they will not be reclaimed. (1) It rendereth the Means used to bring men to repent, &amp; reform; vain, and ineffectual; Instructions, Directions, Perswasions, Disswasions, Promises, Threats; The Word, the Rod: The Word profiteth not without Faith; the Rod profits not, <HI>In vain have I smitten, why should you be smitten any more</HI>? (2) It fills men with Atheism; to conclude, either there is no God, or He is not such a God as He is declared to be. <HI>The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God,</HI> Psal. 14.1. What follows, <HI>They are corrupt, they have done abominable Works, there is none that doeth good.</HI> Unbelief saith, God seeth not: Job 22.13, 14. <HI>Thou sayest how doth God Know, can he judge through the dark cloud. Thick Clouds are a covering to him, He seeth not.</HI> Psal. 94.7. <HI>They say, the Lord doth not see, neither doth the God of Jacob regard it.</HI> Zeph. 1.12. <HI>That say in their heart God will not do good, neither will he do evil.</HI> (3) It regards neither Law nor Gospel. It despi∣ses the Promises: derideth the Threats, Isa. 5.19. <HI>They say let him make speed, and hasten his work that we may see it. Let the Counsel of the holy one come that we may Know it.</HI> They draw iniquity with cords,
<PB REF="001369_0012_0FB29354E9EBDF60"/>
and Sin with Cartropes. (4) It abuseth the good∣ness, and long-suffering of God, which should lead to Repentance; to Harden in Sin, Eccl. 8.11. <HI>Be∣cause Judgment against an evil work is not speedily ex∣ecuted: therefore the hearts of the Sons of men are fully set to do evil.</HI> But let such know, that the longer Judgment is delayed, the Heavier it will be when it cometh. Rom. 9.22. <HI>What if God willing to shew his Wrath, and make his Power known, indured with long-suffering the Vessels of wrath fitted for destruction.</HI> It shall come; it hath sometime Leaden feet, but Iron hands. Sin shall not go unpunished. <HI>Your Sin shall find you out: Though hand joyn in hand, the wicked shall not go unpunished.</HI> 1 Tim. 5.24, 25. <HI>Some mens Sins are open before hand, going before to judgment: and some they follow after. Likewise the good works of some are manifest before hand, and they that are other∣wise cannot be hid.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. As Unbelief holds men Obstinate in Sin, and Perpetuates Sin; So it Perpetuateth Miseries, the just Punishment, and bitter fruit of Sin: Tempo∣ral here, and eternal hereafter; everlasting De∣struction; Men don't believe, therefore they don't obey: therefore they shall be punished <HI>with an Everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the Lord, — from the Glory of his Power,</HI> 2 Thes. 1.9. <HI>A part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimstone, which is the Second Death.</HI> Rev. 21.8. <HI>But the fearful and unbe∣lieving and abominable, and murderers, and whore∣mongers,</HI> &amp;c. They are Unbelieving, therefore it is they are Fearful, Abominable, Whore-mongers, Sorcerers, &amp;c. and so have their part in that Lake.
<PB REF="001369_0013_0FB29356B3468E70"/>
Now some USE and Improvement.
USE. I. See the great Evil of <HI>Unbelief.</HI> Evil in it's Self: Evil to GOD; Evil to Man; Evil in its fruits. It is a root of Bitterness, whence the gall and wormwood of Evils both Sinful and Painful proceed. Men are more ready to be convinced of, and charge themselves with the guilt of other Sins than with <HI>this</HI>: yet this is a Mother Sin. The damning Sin. Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth shall be saved: he that believeth not shall be damned. He that believeth not, shall not see life: the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> He that believeth shall be Saved, were his Sins never so many. He that believeth not shall be damned, were his Sins never so few.</P>
<P>USE. II. <HI>Examination.</HI> Are we guilty of this Sin of Unbelief? If we are, Let us see it: be convinced of it: Conviction of Unbelief is a step to Faith, and so to Life, and Salvation; All Salva∣tions, Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal.</P>
<P>Let me offer something in way of Trial, and Conviction.</P>
<P N="1">1. Have not we provoked the Lord our God; Provoked him greatly? Read the cause in the effect. Sin, in the Punishment. Have not Gods Judgments been great? Have not therefore our Sins been grievous? Would a gracious God, and merciful Father, who doth not willingly afflict, nor grieve the Children of men, Inflict sore, and
<PB REF="001369_0014_0FB2935C02A5E6F8"/>
heavy Judgments on His People, were not their Sins great and hainous? We have confessed <HI>Guilty</HI>: It hath been oft confessed, and acknowledged, and that before this Honourable Assembly. I might remind you of many considerable Testimo∣nies, that have been here given. I shall mention but one, in the year 1698. He is a Stranger to the Affairs of <HI>New-England,</HI> and one that considers not the Operation of God, that knows not this. Who knows not that our Fields that use to smell as the Fields that God hath blessed, Have a long time been blasted. A fruitful Land been turned into barreness. Instead of Plenty, we have had Scarcity: of Health, Sickness: of Peace, War. Instead of Divine Favour, Direction, Protection: we have had Desertions, Frustrations, Rebukes in things of greatest Importance. Our Degeneracy is too palpable to be denied, too gross to be ex∣cused: It calls rather for Lamentation, than for Proof, and Demonstration. I may mind you of the Words of an Eminent Divine, in his Epistle prefixed to a Sermon Preached on a day of Election in the year 1674. they are as followeth. <Q>Do not the Ancient men that have seen the first House weep over this? If we be not sensible of these things, our case is no less desperate than <HI>Ephraim's,</HI> when gray Hairs were upon him and he knew it not. That People who were newly come out of the hands of those that sometimes said to their Souls, <HI>Bow down that we may go over</HI>: And whose present Interest was to carry on Temple Work, when they were arrived to a
<PB REF="001369_0015_0FB2935D758D55D8"/>
full enjoyment of Peace and Liberty, soon for∣got their main and true interest, being under the Powerful and Prevailing interest of a World∣ly and Degenerate Spirit: and yet they said, wherein shall we return. How many are with us of the same Spirit, making the same enquiry? It is a difficult thing to reclaim an Apostatising, &amp; Backsliding People. Almost all present would be let alone in the condition wherein they are: and those that would reform them will be look'd upon as troublers.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Have we not provoked God long? Many years hath God been contending with us: follow∣ing of us with variety of Judgments, which we have been bleeding under. God hath been Long∣suffering, not willing we should perish.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hath not God shewn us our Transgressions, and our Sins? As in <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.1. Hath not God been long Warning, and Calling upon us to turn from our evil ways, and doings, which have not been good?</P>
<P N="4">4. Hath not God been using means with us? Word and Rod, greater and lesser Judgments, sig∣nal Mercies and Deliverances. God hath remem∣bred Mercies in the midst of Judgments: He hath been Compassionate: As in <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.38. <HI>Being full of Compassion he forgave them their Iniquities, and de∣stroyed them not. Many a time he turned away his Anger, and did not stir up all his Wrath: for he remem∣bred they were but flesh.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Have not Means been ineffectual? Are not those Sins, God hath been contending for,
<PB N="15" REF="001369_0016_0FB2935F11E1FCD8"/>
committed as much, or more than before? Have not our Iniquities encreased over our heads? Sin abounded, love waxed cold. Is there not a great deal of Atheism, Prophaneness, Sensuality, Pride, Oppression, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> among Some; Luke-warmness, Formality, Hypocrisy, decays in Faith, Love, Zeal among others. Many shameless in Sin, as <HI>Jer.</HI> 6.15. Graceless in Profession: Profess they know God, but keep not his commands. They love God, but love not their Brethren, but live in Malice, Envy, Strife, Wrath, Contention. Jam. 3.14, 15. <HI>But if there be bitter envying, and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not against the Truth. This Wisdom descendeth not from above, but is Earthly, Sen∣sual and Devilish.</HI> They Profess themselves Reli∣gious, but bridle not their Tongues, Jam. 1.26, <HI>If any man seem to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, This man's Religion is vain. They make their boast of the Law, but by breaking the Law dishonour God; abhor Idols, but commit Sacrilege</HI>? Rom. 2.23. Are there not Multitudes of Uncircumcised Unconverted Souls, that hate to be Reformed? God is angry with them every dayp: God will punish the Circumcised with the Uncircumcised: <HI>Egypt and Judah, Edom and Ammon,</HI> Jer. 9.26.</P>
<P N="6">6. Do we not still provoke God? Is not his hand still stretched out? God hath not yet Sub∣dued our Enemies; nor turned his hand against our Adversaries: As Psal. 81.13. <HI>O that my People had hearkened to me, and Israel had walked in my ways, I should soon have subdued their Enemies.</HI> A great
<PB N="16" REF="001369_0017_0FB293607A704420"/>
part of the Land lyeth in ruins, and desolate; great Part fear, or are in danger day and night: there is no Peace, nor Safety to him that goeth out, nor to him that cometh in: Many may be said rather to indure Life, than to enjoy Life. What would many give to enjoy the days they have seen? to go out in Peace, to lye down in Peace, and none to make them afraid? The way to obtain it, is to make Peace with God; to have no Peace with Sin; to put away the evil of their doings; to cease to do evil, to learn to do well. It is in vain to look for Good, or Promise them∣selves Peace, while they walk in the imagination of their own hearts. Deut. 29.19. <HI>And it come to pass when he heareth the Words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have Peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart: The Lord will not spare him, but the anger and jealousy of the Lord shall Smoke against that man,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7. Doth not God yet complain, <HI>How long? How long will you Provoke?</HI> How long shall vain thoughts lodge within you? How long ye simple ones will you love simplicity? Men are ready to complain of God, Isa. 58.3. <HI>Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest not, afflicted our Soul, and thou takest no Knowledge.</HI> How long will God hide his face? How long ere God hear, help, arise? But how long will it be ere they hear; turn to Him that smites? Put away their Idols, the evil of their doings: Isa. 59.1. Gods <HI>Hand is not shortened that he cannot save, nor his ear heavy that he cannot

hear: But your iniquities have separated between you, and your God, your sins have hid His face from you, that he will not hear.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Is not <HI>Unbelief</HI> the cause of all this? Must we not confess guilty?</P>
<P>USE. III. We have seen our Malady, <HI>viz. Unbelief,</HI> That hath brought all our Miseries, and Calamities upon us; and if continued in, will yet bring more, seven times more: If we will yet provoke, God will still punish. Let us seek a Re∣medy: get Unbelief cured, Unbeliving hearts Circumcised: Get Faith. 2 Chron. 20.20. <HI>Believe in the Lord so shall you be established, believe his Pro∣phets so shall you prosper.</HI> God hath warned us by his Prophets. Hath not God testifyed by all His Prophets? <HI>Saying, Turn ye from your evil ways.</HI> Have not the former Prophets given early warn∣ing of Sins then present, and prevailing; of Judg∣ments impending and approaching? Let us be∣lieve: <HI>Nineveh</HI> believed, and they were spared, Jonah 3.10. <HI>God saw their works that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil he said he would do unto them, and did it not.</HI> Israel believed not, and they are rejected: 2 King. 17.14.—20. <HI>They heardened their Necks like their Fa∣thers, that did not believe in the Lord their God.</HI> The Lord rejected them, afflicted them, and de∣livered them into the hand of Spoilers. If we will not believe, the means that are for our softening, will harden us, and we shall Sin more,
<PB N="18" REF="001369_0019_0FB2936374911F70"/>
and provoke more, and at last be destroyed without remedy. God may bear long, wait long, but not always: Isa. 42.14. <HI>I have a long time refrained my self, now will I destroy and devour at once.</HI> Jer. 15.7. — <HI>I will destroy my People, sith they turn not from their ways.</HI> Ezek. 24.14. <HI>I the Lord have spoken it, and it shall come to pass, and I will do it, I will not go back, I will not spare, I will not repent.</HI> God hath so done: He hath oft done it: He will so do: He is the same God: He is Un∣changeably Just and Holy. God hath so done to <HI>Shiloh,</HI> where the House of God was continued almost four hundred years. To <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> once called, <HI>The perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole Earth.</HI> To the Churches in <HI>Asia,</HI> once glorious, planted by the Apostles: These Candlesticks have been removed for a long time out of their places, not one remaining. To many Thousand Chur∣ches in <HI>Africa.</HI> Many Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> since the Reformation. In <HI>Saxony, Bohemia, Hungaria, Poland, France,</HI> and other Places, Unchurched and Dissipated. To the Churches among the ancient <HI>Britains,</HI> in the Land of our Fathers Sepulchres. When other Judgments would not Reform them, God at last brought the <HI>Saxons</HI> upon them, who rooted them out of the Land. There is a day of Gods Patience, a set time, with some longer, some shorter; when that time is once expired, there is no place for Repentance, either on God's part, or on Man's part. God will not repent: <HI>Ezek.</HI> 24.24. Man shall not be purged: Ezek. 24, 13. <HI>Thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any
<PB N="19" REF="001369_0020_0FB293657017FB30"/>
anymore, till I cause my fury to rest upon thee.</HI> It sometimes comes and goes again; but at length it rests and abideth, till it utterly consumeth: The things of their Peace are then hid from their eyes, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.42, 43. Christ wept over the City, <HI>Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou at least in this thy day, the things which belong to thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes. They shall not leave one Stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy Visitation.</HI> A general Security under, or after Divine Judgments, and Warnings, is a fore-runner of a general and speedy Destruction, When the Prophets Prophesie Peace, and the Peo∣ple Promise Peace: When there is a Spirit of deep Sleep poured on them, and their eyes are closed: <HI>Isa.</HI> 29.10. Jer. 14.13. <HI>Then said I, Ah Lord God, behold the Prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the Sword, — but I will give you assured Peace in the Land. Thus saith the Lord, by the Sword, and Famine shall those Prophets be consumed. And the Peo∣ple to whom they Prophesie, shall be cast out in the Streets, and there shall be none to bury them:</HI> — Ezek. 13, 10. <HI>They have seduced my People, saying Peace, when there was no Peace. One built up a Wall, and others daubed it with untempered Mortar.</HI> Jer. 5. ult. <HI>The Prophets Prophesie falsly, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and my People love to have it so: and what will you do in the end thereof?</HI> 1 Thess. 5.3. <HI>When they shall say Peace, and Safety: then sudden Destruction cometh upon them, as travail on a Woman with Child, and thay shall not escape.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="001369_0021_0FB2936675702D00"/>USE. IV. We have cause to Lament our De∣generacy and Obstinacy therein; to be hum∣bled under the Divine Rebukes of Heaven, which we have been long under. Yet let us not for∣get the many Mercies of God, which call for our Thankfulness, and due Acknowledgements. We are Subjects of many, and great Sins, and Provo∣cations. Yet are Subjects of many and great Mercies, undeserved Mercies. Our Mercies are more, and greater than we deserve. Our evil things, and afflictions are fewer, and less. Let our Unworthiness turn to Gods Praise, make us more admire, and magnify Mercy. Let good∣ness lead to Repentance; Long-suffering be Sal∣vation. Among many, Let me instance a few.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have seen many a black and dark day. Drank of the Waters of gall and wormwood, and the wine of astonishment; have seen great ruins, and desolations, yet God hath preserved us from utter Desolation: 'Tis the Lords Mercy we are not utterly consumed; though God hath visited our iniquities with the Rod, yet he hath not taken his Loving-kindness from us: He hath corrected with Judgment, therefore we are not brought to nothing, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.24.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we have had so long a time of quiet∣ness, no more disturbance from the Enemy: Breaking in, and Leading out, crys of Blood and Violence: which next to God, is, and hath been ascribed to the good conduct of Him that Sitteth
<PB N="21" REF="001369_0022_0FB293683B767538"/>
at the Helm of Government; by whose Perspi∣caciousness, Vigilance, and Activity, the Fron∣tiers have been preserved above what they have been in former Wars; which hath Been abun∣dantly acknowledged with Thankfulness, to GOD, and the <HI>QUEEN.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The great blessing of GOD to us, and our Nation, in giving so Gracious a QUEEN, whose Heart GOD hath enclined to Favour His People, to Suppress, and Punish Vice, and Immorality, to encourage and promote what is good: A good King, or Queen is a great blessing, and gift of God's Love: I King. 10.9. — <HI>Because the Lord Loved Israel, he made thee King to do Justice, and Judgment.</HI> Kings have a great Influence upon the People. 'Tis ordinarily, <HI>Regis ad exemplum — Qualis Rex, talis grex.</HI> Like King, like People. So it was with the Children of Israel; and so it hath been with Other Nations.</P>
<P N="4">4. Our Civil Enjoyments. A good Govern∣ment. A good GOVERNOUR, well accom∣plished for that Service, especially in our diffi∣cult juncture of Affairs. Good Magistrates; Men Faithful and Religious. We may in good measure see our Judges as at first, our Counsellors as at the beginning. Let us Know when we are well! Let not frowardness &amp; discontent make a Change for the worse? We have an able Pilot; it may be dangerous putting the Helm into the hand of one unexperienced, in a Stormy &amp; Tempestuous Season.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="22" REF="001369_0023_0FB2936B061D9510"/>5. Enjoyments Spiritual, which were so Sacred, and dear to, and most highly valued by Our Predecessors. The glorious Gospel: the Gospel of Salvation: the Word of Life: Glad Tidings, the best that ever came to the Ears of the Sons of Men. Ecclesiastical Liberties: The doors of God's house are open; we have his Word, Wor∣ship, Ordinances, in Purity, without any humane Impositions. Take heed, Unthankfulness, and Un∣fruitfulness don't deprive us of the best things; here is our great danger: by slighting and not regarding these things, we shall either justly for∣feit them, or render our selves unworthy the Kingdom, or be hardened to destruction. We are Priviledged as to Spiritual things, above ma∣ny, I think as much as any in the World. We dwell in <HI>Goshen,</HI> a Land of Light; when the great∣est part of Mankind sit in darkness and the shadow of Death. According to Computation, Christianity taken in the largest Latitude, bear∣eth no greater proportion to the other grossly false Religions, than Five to Twenty-five.</P>
<P>The World divided into Thirty parts: <HI>They find of them</HI>

</LIST></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="23" REF="001369_0024_0FB2936C72479CD0"/>6. For the Liberties, and Privileges of this day. Though they are not the same as formerly, and what many of us desired; yet, are they not better than we deserve? It is yet well with us; and it will be well, if they be continued to us: It may be, better than, abused Liberty.</P>
<P>ELECTION being the Work of the Day: Give me leave to Speak a Word to the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the Electors. The Government is in great part E∣lective by the People; which if wisely managed, the <HI>Representatives</HI> will be of the Best: our Coun∣sellours will be of the Best; the most Wise, most Able, most faithful in the Province. If it be not so, who will be to blame? <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Your Wis∣dom, Prudence and Fidelity are consided in: You represent the People: You are chosen by the Peo∣ple; Chosen for the People; Seek their interest and welfare: The great interest of this People hath been, and in good measure, is <HI>Religious.</HI> 'Tis like to fare with us on other accounts, as it go∣eth with Religion: <HI>The Lord is with you while you are with him.</HI> If we let Religion, which is our Life, die, we may not Live long after. You are trusted with the choice of a Council: Have re∣spect to Piety, and the Fear of God in Election. Such, you may expect Gods Presence with them; and Blessing upon them; that their Steps shall be ordered of the Lord, and God will delight in their way. Chuse such as are in the best interest: Chuse for God; Such as will take Care of God∣liness as well as Honesty, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.2. Such as
<PB N="24" REF="001369_0025_0FB2937048777330"/>
God may approve, and not complain: As Hosea 8.4. <HI>They have set up Kings but not by me, they have made Princes &amp; I knew it not.</HI> They are to be Rulers for God. 2 Chron. 9.8. <HI>Blessed be the Lord, thy God which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be King for the Lord thy God.</HI> Chuse men of <HI>Da∣vid</HI>'s Character, Acts 13.22. — <HI>A man after mine own heart, which will fulfill all my Will.</HI> [<HI>Greek</HI>] <HI>Wills.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Here are three Characters, or Evidences of Integrity; a Man after Gods Heart. (1) Universality in Obedience. [<HI>All</HI>] (2) Perseverance; <HI>He fulfilleth, he goeth on, finisheth.</HI> (3) Sincerity; his Motive is God's Will, because God willeth it. Labour to Chuse Such as are like the Children of <HI>Issachar,</HI> 2 Chron. 12.32. <HI>Men that had Understanding in the times to know what Israel ought to do.</HI> It would be good to take men that are advantaged by Liberal Education, by Knowledge of Affairs abroad, as well as Customs at home; and of the Transactions; and what hath passed in former Ages: without which Knowledge, men will hardly attain to be great States Men. <HI>Qui respicit praterita, Inspicit prasentia, prospicit futura.</HI> He that looketh back to Times past, into Times present, may give a conjecture of Times future. I shall not take upon me to teach, or prescribe the Great and General Court in their Civil Poli∣tical Affairs; but am willing to be prescribed by them; to submit to all their good and wholsome Ordinances, and be at their Command. I shall not take upon me to Counsel the Great Council, but Pray God to be their Counsellour whose
<PB N="25" REF="001369_0026_0FB29371B3DCE2D0"/>
Name is, Wonderful, Counsellour; who is God only Wise, the God of Wisdom, and the giver of Wisdom. I need not mind you to have regard to the Interest of CHRIST, the Best Interest. God hath given this Part of these Ends of the Earth to His Son for a Possession: You know it is your Duty to maintain His Possession what you can. God hath set you as a Hedge, a Wall, part of the defence upon the Glory. I need not mind you of <HI>Schools of Learning,</HI> to encourage and uphold them: But thankfully acknowledge your Care, and Provision made for this end. If Learning should utterly fall here, this Land would be re∣duced to it's Primitive Darkness, notwithstanding the light that is in every man that cometh into the World. It is matter of thankfulness, that the COLLEGE is so well Setled with a <HI>Resident∣President,</HI> a thing long desired; a Person so well accomplished, and furnished for that Service, having been extraordinarily Advantaged thereto. He Succeeds Men eminent in Piety, and of great Learning. God grant the Blessing to Him, and to the Province; that as he <HI>Succeeds,</HI> so he may not fall short, but rather <HI>Exceed</HI>; Give a double Portion.</P>
<P>I shall not add any thing further, but conclude with a Word of <HI>Exhortation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let us consider what hath been said, and the Lord give us understanding in all things.</HI> I have said no∣thing,
<PB N="26" REF="001369_0027_0FB2937551213930"/>
as to the Substance, <HI>Quod non ante dictum,</HI> that hath not been before said. It hath been, and is the general Voice of the Ministry, and therefore calleth for a Serious regard. Let us once at last <HI>Believe,</HI> and let us shew our Faith by our Works. Let <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> and the whole Congregation of the Lord, every one according to his Character, endeavour to revive <HI>Godliness,</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> and to Suppress all <HI>Vice,</HI> and pursue it to the out-most. Though means used have hitherto been without the desired Success: Yet give not over, be not discouraged; do not say, there is no Hope! Our case is bad; yet not desperate: there is <HI>Balm in Gilead,</HI> there is a <HI>Phy∣sician there.</HI> God can Heal us. <HI>Lord if thou wilt, thou canst make us clean</HI>! Soveraign Mercy may Save us: Isai. 57.17. <HI>I have seen his ways, and will heal him.</HI> Implore Mercy, Convincing, Conver∣ting, Healing, Pardoning Mercy, for Mercies Sake, God's Name Sake, for Christs Sake, who is Worthy, though we are unworthy. <HI>Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord, be ashamed and con∣founded, for your own ways.</HI> Ezek. 36.22, 32. Pray with <HI>Ephraim, Turn thou me, and I shall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God.</HI> If God hear us with <HI>Ephraim</HI> bemoaning our Selves, He may say to us as he did to <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer. 3I.20. <HI>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is be my pleasant Child: Since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: My bowels are troubled for him, I will surely have Mercy on him, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001369_0028_0FB29377DDF3FBE8"/>Now to excite here-unto.</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider the Necessity of <HI>Reforming.</HI> If we are not Reforming, we shall be Deforming, Sinning; we shall yet be more Sinful, and more Miserable. If the torrent, or flood of Vice be not Stopped, an over-flowing Scourge will follow, and over-take. Let Her <HI>Majesties</HI> Royal PRO∣CLAMATION for Punishing Vice and Immora∣lities, be attended, which She so strictly enjoyns, as they Tender God's Honour, Her Favour, their own Welfare. It might be great Advantage, were Her Majesties Royal Proclamation follow'd in <HI>New-England,</HI> as it was in <HI>Old-England,</HI> with <HI>Reforming Societies.</HI> Let the good Laws Enacted be duly Executed. A Violation of Laws is not so hurtful, as a Non-execution. If we will not be Warned, when Warnings are given; Reformed, when Reproved; be prevailed with, when beseeched; Regard, when threatned; be amended, when corrected; be purged, when God would purge us; What will our End be? Our flesh may tremble! <HI>O that my People were Wise, that they would consider their latter end. O that there were such a heart in my People, that they would fear me, that it might be well with them, and their Children after them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Benefit, and Good of it. How happy might we then be? It would be well with us not∣withstanding all our Provocations; they should
<PB N="28" REF="001369_0029_0FB293795B18F360"/>
be all blotted out, and remembred no more. <HI>The iniquities of Jacob shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the Sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will Pardon them.</HI> Could we grieve and mourn for our Sins, our Enemies should not long Rejoyce: God would be grieved for our Miseries, bind our Breaches, repair our Losses, build up the waste Places; make glad according to the days we have seen Evil; Remove the evils we feel, Prevent the evils we fear, Bestow the good things we want. God would be an Enemy to our Enemies; they that devour us, should be devoured; they that Spoil us, should be a Spoil; and they that Prey upon us, should be given for a Prey: the Enemies that come against us should be Smitten before us: they that come out against us One Way should flee before us Seven Ways; God would give Peace in the Land; we shall dwell in Safety, and none shall make us afraid: God would keep us Night and Day: He would Water us every Moment: So our Last days might be our Best; and our Latter End better than our Beginning. Let those that Love Sion Seek it, say, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
<P>Let GOD bless us, turn us from our Iniqui∣ties heal our Back-slidings, save us from <HI>Unbelief,</HI> give us to Believe to REFORMATION, and SALVATION. Let God even our God continue to be the Lord our God, to be with us, as with our Fathers; a God keeping Covenant and
<PB N="29" REF="001369_0030_0FB37DD67A374648"/>
Mercy. Let God continue us to be His People, a People Keeping Covenant, and Duty, from Generation to Generation throughout all Ages, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
