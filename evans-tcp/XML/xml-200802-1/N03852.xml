<HEAD>A LETTER TO MERCHANT IN <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have the favour of yours of</HI> 1<HI>st December per the</HI> Bladen, <HI>with Copies of the Reports of the Board of Trade and Plantations, and of the Committee of Council for Plan∣tation Affairs; concerning our Land-Bank so called: I observe that having examined into the Na∣ture of the Scheme, and of the refusal of the</HI> House of Representatives <HI>to pay any Regard to the</HI> GOVERNOUR's <HI>Message concerning
<PB N="4" REF="004738_0003_100DD11DC8406188"/>
the same; they approve of the Governour and Councils Pro∣ceedings, and do declare that the said Scheme appears to them to be not only Illegal, but of dangerous Tendency; and must create great Confusion, and Interruption in Business, as well to the Traders in New-England, as in Great Bri∣tain; and in Order that the said Land-Bank may be as speedi∣ly and effectually suppressed as possible, they are pursuing Methods to put a Stop to the same, until such Time as the Legislature of Great Britain shall take the State of the Paper Currencies of all the Plantations into Consideration.</HI></P>
<P>You desire a particular Account of this <HI>monstrous</HI> (as you call it) <HI>Combination,</HI> lately made, to evade Resolves of Parliament, and King's Instructions; and to assume <HI>by Virtue of their Numbers, the establishing of Currency,</HI> which is absolutely the Prerogative of the Crown; you engage me to keep strictly to <HI>plain Facts,</HI> without Suggestions, and Surmises of my own, or of others: Therefore to avoid all Suspicion of Partiality, instead of a private Letter, I send it you published in the Place where is the Scene of Action.</P>
<P>I must premise <HI>a short Detail of our Plantations Paper-Effects.</HI> Upon some Exigencys, there not being Cash in the Treasury sufficient, there was issued <HI>Treasury Notes</HI> or Obligations, to be satisfyed, or cancelled, in a short Time. The Goodness of the <HI>Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hants,</HI> to strengthen the Hands of the Government, <HI>gave these Notes Credit as Cash.</HI> Some Administrations took Advantage of this Credit given to their Notes, and <HI>imposed upon the Merchant</HI> egregiously:</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> By Issuing out <HI>too large Quantities</HI> of these Notes with <HI>long Periods,</HI> their publick Bills of Credit suffered a growing Discount.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> That this growing Discount might not put a Stop to their Currency, those dependent Colonies by By-Laws
<PB N="5" REF="004738_0004_100DD120A6796938"/>
of their own, assumed the KING's Prerogative in Currencies; and made their own Notes a common <HI>Ten∣der in Law.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> By frequent postponing the Cancellings of those Bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s they encouraged Postponing of private Debts, which has occasioned <HI>a general Insensibility of Discredit</HI> in all Trade, and Business.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly, Shop-Notes</HI> were never used in Payments, until publick Notes took Place, being their genuine Off∣spring; thus Tradesmen, Artificers, and other poor La∣bourers, are left to the Shop-keeper's Mercy, for their Pay in Goods, at any Rate.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> This gave the Hint to <HI>Combinations</HI> for emit∣ting private Bills of Credit, which, if not speedily and effectually quash'd, will inevitably produce <HI>Mutiny, Se∣dition,</HI> and <HI>Riots.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> we have at present an unac∣countable Confusion of Paper Currency: <HI>Publick Bills of Credit,</HI> viz. The old Bills of the four Provinces of <HI>New-England,</HI> at <HI>Twenty nine Shillings</HI> per Ounce, Silver: <HI>Massachusetts</HI> new Tenor, at <HI>Six Shillings and Eight Pence,</HI> but current at <HI>Nine Shillings and Eight Pence. Connecti∣cut</HI> new Tenor, at <HI>Eight Shillings. Rhode-Island</HI> new Tenor, at <HI>Six Shillings and nine Pence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Private Bills of Credit.</HI> 1<HI>st,</HI> Silver Money Scheme or <HI>Merchants Notes,</HI> whereof <HI>One hundred &amp; ten thousand Pounds</HI> Value was emitted, <HI>Anno</HI> 1733, to prevent an enor∣mous <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> publick Emission, from depreciating our Currency: These Bills continue to be <HI>punctually paid in Gold and Silver</HI> as they become due, and are at present 33 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better than Province Bills.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Another Sum of <HI>Merchants Notes,</HI> value <HI>One hundred and twenty thousand Pounds,</HI> emitted, <HI>Anno</HI> 1740,
<PB N="6" REF="004738_0005_100DD12343CEC310"/>
on a Silver Bottom, projected to stifle that pernicious <HI>grand Bubble</HI> called <HI>The Land Bank.</HI> Those Bills, consider'd ab∣stractedly, are advantageous to the Possessor; being pay∣able upon Demand in a legal Currency, they are equivalent to Cash; and carrying a growing Profit of 3 <HI>per Cent. per Annum,</HI> they are better than Province Bills, and (if other ways regular) as good as the Stocks and Com∣panies Bonds in <HI>London</HI>: The Signers without further Recourse upon the Partnership, being our most emi∣nent and wealthy Traders, are capable, when required, to call in, and pay off, all their Bills upon a short Sight.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it was always my Opinion, That all <HI>private Emissions, designed as a common Currency, with∣out a Patent from the Prerogative, are irregular and il∣legal</HI>: A private Person who strikes a <HI>Crown</HI> Piece, tho' equal, or better, in Weight and Fineness, than a <HI>royal Crown Piece</HI>; is equally, in the Eye of our Laws, tho' not in itself, culpable, as a Person who strikes a brass Crown silvered.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>Land-Bank,</HI> or Manufactory Scheme, (the designed Subject of this Letter) being a late Com∣bination of a vast Multitude of necessitous, idle, and ex∣travagant Persons; with all the Signs of a genuine Bubble; contriv'd to have what they call Money, at an easy Rate; and to pay their Debts in a precarious falla∣cious Kind of Bills, very ill, or not at all, secured; of no determined Value; bearing no Interest; not payable (the Possessor cannot oblige to an Acceptance) until after twenty Years, and being a very large Sum (equal to all the then provincial Bills of <HI>New-England</HI>) of <HI>Six hundred thousand Pounds,</HI> will, if not remedied, depreci∣ate all Paper Currencies, that are not determined by a Silver Value, consequently prove a great Prejudice to private Property in the Province, and great Loss and Damage to the Merchants of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> trading to <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004738_0006_100D87DC11213930"/>Your Surmise is groundless, That perhaps some of our Merchants, who have suffered much by deprecia∣ting publick Bills, have, <HI>jesuitically,</HI> and as it were be∣hind the Curtain, <HI>prompted</HI> the unthinking Multitude, to a <HI>Scheme,</HI> running into unheard of Extremities of Sum, and Period; and at this critical Time, when all Paper Money is under the <HI>Censure</HI> of the <HI>Boards</HI> and <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> on purpose to bring the <HI>Parliament</HI> under the Necessity of speedily and effectu∣ally suppressing Paper Money of all Kinds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rise</HI> of this <HI>Scheme,</HI> was from a few evil-mind∣ed Men, contrived only for their own Benefit, and have admitted a great Multitude of Subscribers, by their Numbers to give it a Circulation, and to contri∣bute towards indemnifying them against all Acts of Government. Its being <HI>contrived only for the Benefit of the Directors,</HI> appears by their Constitution.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> They are to be <HI>Directors in Perpetuity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> They are to have a <HI>Negative</HI> in all Resolves of general Meetings.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Their <HI>Sallaries,</HI> other Charges of Manage∣ment, and their living sumptously, at Free-Cost, will amount to <HI>Two per Cent. per Annum,</HI> of the original Stock; (the original <HI>South Sea Stock</HI> of <HI>Ten Millions</HI> was allowed only <HI>Eight thousand Pounds</HI> for Manage∣ment, which is scarce <HI>One</HI> 12<HI>th per Cent. per Annum</HI>) They design to convert <HI>Sixty thousand Pounds</HI> of the <HI>principal Stock</HI> into <HI>Trade,</HI> that they may have a greater <HI>Latitude of imposing</HI> upon the Partnership. The <HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and all other well constituted Banks, are restricted from trading, that their Stock may remain good at home, ready to answer all Demands. Their ludicrous Pretence is, That since the Merchants will not sell them Goods for this worthless Money, they will import all sorts of Merchandise, for the Benefit of the
<PB N="8" REF="004738_0007_100DD1289420F828"/>
Partnership: Their Directors cannot seriously pretend to understand Trade, only one of their Number is called Merchant, or rather a Factor for some <HI>Marooners</HI> or Logwood-Cutters, in the Bay of <HI>Honduras.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> They <HI>alter</HI> the <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Partnership</HI> at Pleasure, without Consent of a general Meeting, pre∣tending (contrary to all good Regulation) that private Consent of the Members, without Deliberation or De∣bate, is sufficient; this is the Reason of their Scheme being so often <HI>botched</HI>: Their Scheme now sent to you, is their last, as it stands in the County Register; it was refused a Record in the Secretary's Office: How soon it may be alter'd, we know not.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> The <HI>County Registers</HI> being lately search'd by Order of the Governour and Council, to find out the civil and military Officers, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty in this Combination; It was discovered, That the principal Projectors, or Bubblers, the <HI>Directors,</HI> &amp;c. had given <HI>no Security</HI> to the Partnership for their good Management, and for their Quota of this Money, taken up some Months since: The sham Reason they give, of being very busy; is not only weak, but fully discovers the Cheat and Imposition; because in all well order'd honest Schemes, the Direc∣tors, or Managers, are the first who give Security.</P>
<P>You desire to know the Nature of our landed Inte∣rest, which by these evil-designing Men, is set up in competition with the trading Interest. In <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the Landed-Interest consists generally of Gentlemen very Rich, with valuable Rent-Rolls; Our <HI>Freeholders</HI> generally are labouring Men, who earn less, and fare worse, than many in <HI>Boston,</HI> and without any Rent-Rolls. Indulge me here, to cast a Vail over the Nakedness of our Country: This Country seems designed by Nature for Trade, not for Produce: We Import Provisions at much easier Rates from the Southern Provinces, than we can afford to raise them here. I am concerned in
<PB N="9" REF="004738_0008_100DD12B66F93410"/>
Lands, and therefore can have no sinister End in dis∣paraging of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ On the other side, <HI>Our Trade</HI> is not Inferiour to that of any of his Majesty's Plantations; and <HI>Our Navigation</HI> much exceeds any of them. The Truth is shortly this; The Debtor part of the Country (which is vastly the most numerous) are contriving to baulk their Creditors by reducing the Denominations of Money (by their huge and ill-secured Emissions) to a small or no Value; that they who have laudably acquired Fortunes by Industry and Frugality, may reap no Benefit thereof, but be upon a level with the Idle and Extravagant: We all have learnt by Experience that large Emissions with distant Periods, have sunk a great Part of Debts, without any Consideration.</P>
<P>The Projectors gave to this <HI>Bubble</HI> the specious Name of, <HI>A Bank</HI>:— It has not the least Affinity to Banking. <HI>Banking</HI> is issuing of Cash-Notes, payable upon Demand: or Merchants having lodged their Cash, the <HI>Bank trans∣fers</HI> Cash from one Merchant's Folio, to that of another, when required.</P>
<P N="1">1st This Sham-Bank has <HI>no Stock</HI> in their Treasury; and the Face of their Bills promising to accept them for Stock in the Treasury is an <HI>arrant Bubble</HI>: It is true, that for some short Time the Directors decoyed some <HI>Graziers and Hog-Drivers,</HI> to part with their Pro∣visions for this their Land-Bank Money, but have ship'd it off in Trade for the Profit of the <HI>D</HI>—, and perhaps to help to indemnify themselves when obliged to make good the Bills by them signed.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, These Bills, tho' carrying no Interest, cannot make an effectual Demand of <HI>Acceptance till after Twenty Years,</HI> and then not payable in current Cash, but in Goods of an <HI>Arbitrary</HI> Assortment and Value.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="004738_0009_100DD12E0DBCEFF0"/>3dly, As Produce and Manufacture are more valuable than depretiating Bills; all Payments of the Partnership of Interest, and Parts of Principal, will be in these Bills; and consequently no Produce, or Manufacture, will be found in their Treasury.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Being no Body-Corporate, they are under no Limitation: The Directors, who are for this very Pur∣pose the Signers, may and will emit Bills in <HI>indefinitum,</HI> or until at length their Value become near equal to the Charge of manufacturing them.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, If we can suppose their <HI>Board of Bill-Makers</HI> to be honest-Men, and that in Conscience (they having no other Check but Conscience) they emit no more than according to their first Articles, as they have no <HI>exclusive Patent,</HI> any other Number of desperate Men may fol∣low the same Money-making Trade, and Bills may multiply as in the former Case.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, In other Countries, the Opulent, the Honest, the Men of Credit, become Bankers; here the <HI>Indigent,</HI> the <HI>Debtors,</HI> the <HI>Frauduleut,</HI> set up for <HI>Bankers</HI>: A Bank of a Numerous, but <HI>poor</HI> People, who pretend to cir∣culate <HI>l.</HI> 600,000 without any Stock.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, To compleat the Farce, the <HI>Securities</HI> for cir∣culating and paying off these Bills, are within them∣selves, and may be <HI>stifled at Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Scheme</HI> is founded upon a Projection, disapproved of by the <HI>General Assembly</HI> A. D. 1714; but is <HI>more Ini∣quitous</HI>; That of A. D. 1714, required the Persons in Trust, particularly the Treasurer to be of good Interest, known Integrity, and Reputation; and the Treasurer to give <HI>l.</HI> 10,000 Security; The Directors to be distinct from the Trustees, and to be chosen Annually at a Ge∣neral Meeting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Committee distinct from the Directors to perfect and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bills.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004738_0010_100DD13085FDDFE0"/>The Projectors and Managers of this Scheme have <HI>Debauched</HI> the Minds of the People, by Instilling unto them some pernicious Principles, destructive of all So∣ciety, and good Government;</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> That <HI>common Consent,</HI> or the Humour of the Multitude, ought to be the <HI>Ratio Ultima</HI> in every Thing and particularly in <HI>Currencies</HI>; whereas not only accor∣ding to the Constitution of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but of all po∣lite Governments, Money or Currencies are the <HI>Pre∣rogative</HI> of the the SOVEREIGNS, and have followed the universal Custom of Merchants, whereby <HI>Silver</HI> from its own natural Qualifications, could not avoid becoming the <HI>universal Medium of Trade.</HI> If we may suppose a Country entirely separated from the trading Part of the World, common Consent may admit of any Thing for a Currency, according to the Humour, or Profit of the Projectors; but this will fluctuate from one thing to another, until at length the most proper Material obtain a permanent Consent: It is doubtless a <HI>high Misdemea∣nour</HI> to assert strenously, the Priviledge of the People, to emit and pass any Thing as a Currency, in defiance, of the KING's <HI>Prerogative</HI> of <HI>Currencys.— Middleton,</HI> a neighbouring Town, has lately unanimously voted, that <HI>This Bank-Money</HI> shall be received as Cash for Town-Rates.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> That every <HI>Landed Man,</HI> even to the mortgaging of his last Acre, has a <HI>Right</HI> to make <HI>Money</HI>: This is a most destructive and wicked Principle, the Se∣curity and Bulwark of a Country, are these People who have valuable Possessions and Effects to loose; whereas they who are much in Debt, become desperate, and bad Subjects, and have nothing to hinder them from relin∣quishing their Country to the first Invader.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the <HI>industrious Merchants,</HI> and frugal monied Men, are the Bane of a Country; because they expect their Debts and Dues to be honestly paid: Whereas a Country without Trade is of little Value,
<PB N="12" REF="004738_0011_100DD1331B705290"/>
and would soon return to its primitive Waste. People of Genius for Trade grow rich by the Labour of Pea∣sants, and the Peasants or Labourers happy by being employed: This Province noted for Trade, would soon become a Habitation of <HI>rude Rusticks.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> To <HI>value themselves as being formidable</HI> by their Numbers, Two Thousand Principals, as they pub∣lish, and many Thousand Abettors: This is <HI>Ruffian</HI> like, by Superiority of Numbers, to endeavour to make ho∣nest People <HI>buy the Rabbit.</HI> Such dangerous bare-fac'd Combinations, are not to be conniv'd at in Government; they openly threaten, that in the next Assembly, no Body shall be a <HI>Representative,</HI> or of the <HI>Council,</HI> but those who are Principals or Abettors in this Scheme; and thus have formed an <HI>Imperium in imperio.</HI> If this Wickedness of Combinations, under the Name of Banking, should spread into our neighbouring <HI>Charter Governments</HI> (in <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> they have gone some Lengths in it) where all the Negatives, or Branches of the Legislature are elective by the People; they would become Masters in all Affairs of Legislature and Government; their Dependance upon and Subjec∣tion to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> would soon vanish. At this Time, in Neglect or Contempt of the Resolves of <HI>Par∣liament,</HI> and subsequent <HI>King's</HI> Instructions, <HI>Connecticut</HI> have emitted <HI>One hundred and eight thousand Pounds,</HI> and <HI>Rhode Island, Eighty thousand Pounds,</HI> Province Bills.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> By the inclosed News-Papers, printed in <HI>Boston,</HI> you may see, and we here upon the Spott do daily hear, how the <HI>Managers</HI> spirit the People to <HI>Mu∣tiny, Sedition,</HI> and <HI>Riots</HI>: One gives it for Law, That no <HI>Orders</HI> from the Boards at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> nor Acts of <HI>Parliament,</HI> can put a Stop to their Proceedings; Others say, We shall <HI>humble</HI> the proud Merchants; That if the Merchants will not receive these Bills in Pay, they must blame themselves for any <HI>Outrages</HI> that may hap∣pen;
<PB N="13" REF="004738_0012_100DD13506BE49B0"/>
That We had as good perish by the Sword as by Famine, that is, by being <HI>Dragoon'd,</HI> as by Want of Money; That upon a <HI>French Invasion,</HI> if we submit, We cannot be worse than at present; that is poor and in Debt; because the Government or private Combina∣nations will not let us have Paper Money, to the Ruin of the good People of the Province.</P>
<P>You desire to know what has been done by the <HI>Go∣vernment of the Province towards their Suppression</HI>: One of the Negatives, I mean the House of <HI>Representatives, stand out</HI>; so that the Legislature can do nothing. The <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> have acted with much Pru∣dence and Fortitude; and are dismissing all Officers, Civil and Military, of their Appointment, who are con∣cerned in this Combination; only the <HI>Chairman</HI> of the Directors, and the <HI>Indorser,</HI> their Commissions or War∣rants being from <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> cannot be dismiss'd; but their Dismissions, by their Constituents at home, may be expected.</P>
<P>You take the Liberty to surmise, a Liberty which you would not allow to me;</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> That for the present, the most summary Way of proceeding against this Combination, would be, To send for the <HI>Treasurer, Directors,</HI> and <HI>Indorser,</HI> to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> by a <HI>Messenger,</HI> with a Secretary of State's War∣rant, to bring them upon Examination, concerning this high Crime and Misdemeanour: But this would ruin them in their small Fortunes, and render them less capa∣ble to satisfy the Possessors of the Bills, when returned upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> That the <HI>Mortgages</HI> of <HI>Lands</HI> in the Partner∣ship <HI>cannot be sued out</HI> by the Managers; because there was no valuable Consideration received. Thus the Possessors having only the Estates of the Signers liable, would not receive above <HI>Two Shillings</HI> in the Pound.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="14" REF="004738_0013_100DD137AF2F9ED0"/>3<HI>dly,</HI> That the Possessors having had sufficient War∣ring from the Government, can claim none of their <HI>Compassion.</HI></P>
<P>We hope that the Government, who are the Parents and Guardians of the People, will act, as natural Parents do with their Children, guilty of some Follies, after repeated Admonition.</P>
<P><HI>In all Bubbles, Combinations,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>the Guilt of the Projectors and Managers is from a corrupt Principle; but the Error in their Followers, the Multitude, is only from a Mistake in Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I have now given you my Tho'ts of this singular Peice of Iniquity, in the most impartial Manner I am able, and hope it will be satisfactory to you, assuring you I am, with all poffible Respect,</P>
