<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL WORK.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Author of this work more than twenty years were wasted in learning, teaching, and diligently scruti∣nizing every part of medicine. The first five past away in hearing others, studying what he had heard, implicitly be∣lieving it, and entering upon the possession as a rich and va∣luable inhertance. <HI>His mode of employment</HI> the next five years, was to explain more clearly the several particulars, to refine and give them a nicer polish. During the next equal space of time, because no part of it had succeeded to his mind, he became cold upon the subject, and, with ma∣ny eminent men, <HI>even</HI> with the vulgar themselves, to de∣plore the healing art as altogether uncertain and incompre∣hensible. <HI>All this time passed away</HI> without <HI>the acquisition of</HI> any advantage, and of that, which of <HI>all</HI> things is the most agreeable to the mind, the light of truth; and so great, so precious, a portion of the fading and short-lived age of man was lost. It was only betwixt the fifteenth and twentieth year <HI>of his studies,</HI> that, like a traveller in an unknown country, wandering in the shade of night, after lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing eve∣ry trace of his road, a very obscure gleam of light, like that of the first break of day, dawned upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="022373_0003_0FB86CFE7919BCA0"/>
Thirteen years ago<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Four years must be added now, it being that time since the second volume of the Elementa was published, that is, seventeen years since the author's first fit of the gout. At this very time from hard walking in very hot weather, to inspect the beauties and majesty of Hampton-Court, he had a slight attack, which gave him no sort of trouble, never hinder∣ed him from business, and which he repelled in less than thirty-six hours.</NOTE>, when he was going in the thirty-sixth year of his age, he fell into his first fit of the gout. For many years before he had lived well, with the excep∣tion of having confined himself to a diet more sparing than usual a few months before the arrival of the disease<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">It was about six months.</NOTE>. In about six weeks the disease finished its course, and did not return till six years after, and not even then, but in conse∣quence of unusual low living for several months<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Between five and six.</NOTE>. He was in the vigour of his age, and, excepting the taint of the gout, and some debility, brought on by his unusual absti∣nence, his habit was good. The disease, according to an old theory among physicians, was said to depend upon ple∣thora and excessive vigour; vegetable aliment was enjoin∣ed, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne was forbidden, and the careful execution of <HI>that plan of cure</HI> was promised to be rewarded with no return of the disease. A whole year past in a strict adherence to this regimen. In the course of that space of time, <HI>instead of never having a return of the disease,</HI> he experienced no less than four fits, most violent, most painful, and of a very great duration: <HI>In short,</HI> the whole year, except fourteen days, was divided between limping and excruciating pain.</P>
<P>If an over-proportion of blood and excess of vigour was the cause of the disease, <HI>according to the general theory just now mentioned,</HI> it became next with him a subject of enquiry, how such distressing symptoms were to be explained; his reflections were, why the disease had not made its <HI>first</HI> ap∣pearance
<PB N="iii" REF="022373_0004_0FB86D03CD44B2B0"/>
twelve or fifteen years before, <HI>at a time</HI> when there was <HI>in reality</HI> more blood and vigour in the system<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">The blood is made from the food, and is in proportion to the quantity, quality, and completeness of its digestion. Now, before each of his last fits for the time specified in the text, as well as during the whole course of the attacks of the second year, his food had been almost solely vegetable, and, therefore, was not suited to produce enough, much less an excessive quantity, of blood, and the digestion was also more imperfect.</NOTE>, and why it only came on after an abatement of diet both consi∣derable in degree and duration; why so great an interval of time, during which he had returned to his usual full di∣et, had intervened betwixt the first fit and the recent ones; and, why the disease had twice, almost instantaneously, come on after the change of <HI>full nourishing</HI> diet into a spa∣ring one. At last the solution of this question was made out by the interposition of one of greater magnitude, in the following interrogatories: What is the effect of food, drink, and similar supports of life? They produce strength. What is their effect afterwards? Always less and less. What is it towards the end of life? They are so far from giving any more strength, that they evidently prove weak∣ening. Nay, the very same powers, by which life was at first supported, at last put an end to it, commonly through the intervention of disease.</P>
<P>As diseases first, and death after, in general happen in the way <HI>that has been just now</HI> explained, not from want, but an over-abundance of the supports of life, he found, however, that the cause was debility, and saw that it was not debilitating<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">according to the common practice of evacuation and starving;</NOTE>, but strengthening, powers that were to be thought upon as remedies. To this sort of debility he thought proper to give the name of indirect. Such for
<PB N="iv" REF="022373_0005_0FB86D054E5B2FA8"/>
two years was the success of his invigorating plan<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">which he immediately after the last mentioned reflections and queries carried into execution;</NOTE>, that at the end of that <HI>space of time</HI> he only underwent a a very slight fit, which did not amount to a fourth part of any of the former ones<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">the fit that happened at the thirty-sixth year of his age, and the four severe ones, that attacked him about six years after, all within the course of the same year.</NOTE>. Now, no physician will deny, that the recurrence of such a disease <HI>as the gout,</HI> which had made four attacks in one year, would have been more fre∣quent than in that proportion the next two years, had the same method of cure been continued; nor will any one think the addition of two fits every year too much. The mild fit was four times less in degree than the more violent ones. Multiply, therefore, twelve by four, and, accord∣ing to that computation, the proportion of alleviation of the disease will amount to a reduction of eight and forty to one. As, during the first year, he made use of vegetable food alone, so, during these two years, his only food was of the land animal kind, and of the most nutrient quality. <HI>Of the latter,</HI> his choice was directed to the best in kind, <HI>without any other precaution than</HI> being sparing in the quan∣tity he used<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">He found most kinds of fish, whether from the sea or fresh water, nearly as debilitating as vegetable matter, when solely or chiefly relied upon for a meal.</NOTE>. A young gentleman, who lived with him and had laboured under a very severe asthma, in conse∣quenee of <HI>submitting to the same</HI> treatment, suffered only one fit at the end of the <HI>same</HI> two years, instead of <HI>experien∣cing</HI> one every day, <HI>as he had done upon the common treatment.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards, to remove an opinion, that had been often insisted on, of the gout not depending upon debility, be∣cause inflammation accompanied it; little doubting that
<PB N="v" REF="022373_0006_0FB86D06C0DEF620"/>
the inflammation itself depended on debility, he subjected the question to experiment. He invited some friends to dinner, and by the use of certain stimulants used in their presence<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">These are mentioned in Dr. Jones's Enquiry.</NOTE>, recovered the most perfect use of that foot, with which, before dinner, he could not touch the floor for pain. By this <HI>fact</HI> he saw, that <HI>not only the gout itself,</HI> but the inflammation accompanying it, was asthenic<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">that is, depending on debility.</NOTE>. And he found, afterwards, such inflammations affecting the throat in the putrid, in the gangrenous sore throat, and the joints in rheumatalgia, or that rheumatism which depends upon debility, and is improperly denominated chronic rheumatism<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">The word rheumatism, as implying a similarity of the disease to the true acute rheumatism, should be rejected, and this term, taken from Sauvage, substituted in its place.</NOTE>, and supposed, if there be any truth in that supposition to attack the brain in the end of typhus, to be also asthenic.</P>
<P>As the gout affects the alimentary canal, and especially the stomach, and proceeds in its course with distressing cir∣cumstances similar to those <HI>that happen</HI> in dyspepsia<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">or indigestion;</NOTE>; being desirous to know if there was any affinity betwixt it and them, he observed that they, as well as it, depended on debility, and yielded to stimulant remedies. Nay, he afterwards found for certain, that all the spasmodic, all the convulsive, diseases of the same canal<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">or, first passages, comprehending the passage to the stomach, that organ itself, and the intestines below it;</NOTE>, and nearly all the diseases of children, were of the same stamp.</P>
<P>Continuing his investigation of the same spasmodic and convulsive diseases, when they occupy the organs of vo∣luntary motion; he discovered that their nature was al∣so
<PB N="vi" REF="022373_0007_0FB86D08390273B0"/>
the same <HI>in kind,</HI> but <HI>only</HI> greater in degree; as <HI>they are exemplified</HI> in the spasms and pains, <HI>that occur</HI> in various parts of the external <HI>surface</HI> of the body, and in epilepsy<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">or the falling sickness,</NOTE>, and in tetanus themselves. And by that means he discerned, that a vast number of affections, in which, upon the supposition of their being inflammatory, no limits had been set to the use of the lancet, <HI>instead of ari∣sing from an over-proportion of blood and excessive vigour, or any other such cause,</HI> depended upon an under-proportion <HI>of that fluid,</HI> and other causes of debility, and were to be cured, not by bleeding, nor any other evacuations<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">such as vomiting, purging, sweating, blistering, glistering, &amp;c.</NOTE>, but by fill∣ing <HI>the vessels,</HI> and restoring the strength <HI>of the whole system.</HI></P>
<P>At first, for the purpose of removing fits of the gout, he went no farther than the use of wine, and other strong drink, of <HI>a</HI> similar <HI>operation,</HI> and nourishing food, that is seasoned meat, and kept the use of the more powerful re∣medies in reserve. But, of late<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">that is, now, for many years past.</NOTE>, his surprising success in the use of the latter, has enabled him to find in opium, and certain other stimuli, the secret of repelling the fits of the gout as often as they returned, and, at the same time, re-establishing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound healthy state, a secret that has hi∣therto been so much wanted and despaired of. This he has often effected both in himself and in other persons. It is now going the third year, and near the end of it<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">now the seventh,</NOTE>, since he has <HI>always</HI> been able to prevent all return of the disease.</P>
<P>Taught by similar instances of actual practice, he found for certain that bleeding discharges, which are called hae∣morrhages, do not depend on plethora and vigour, but upon penury of blood and debility arising from any other
<PB N="vii" REF="022373_0008_0FB86D0E6B3376A8"/>
source, and therefore did he reject them from the number of sthenic diseases<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Sthenic diseases, as will be afterwards explained, are such as de∣pend upon an excessive application of the several powers that otherwise produce health.</NOTE>, among which they had been arran∣ged in the first edition of the text book, reserving a place for them among the asthenic diseases in the second volume of that work. For he saw, that bleeding, various <HI>other</HI> evacuations, abstinence, cold, and sedatives, as they are called, proved hurtful; and that the stimulant plan of cure alone, was salutary. Even wine and brandy, which had been thought so hurtful <HI>in those diseases,</HI> he found the most powerful of all other remedies in removing them. Upon finding that a certain fact; he learned, that in all the dis∣eases, in which others had thought there was abundance of blood, there was a deficiency of it, and that from the defect of that and of other stimulants the <HI>real</HI> cause of <HI>the diseases</HI> was debility; and stimulants, given in proportion to the degree of the cause, the <HI>proper</HI> remedies.</P>
<P>In consequence of the light that thus beamed in from the practice, he found, that the cause and cure of fevers, both intermittent and continued, was the same as those already mentioned.</P>
<P>Gradually led, as it were by the hand of nature, around the whole circle of asthenic diseases<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">diseases of debility.</NOTE>, he thoroughly per∣ceived, that they all depended upon the same cause, that is, debility, that they were all to be removed by the same kind of remedies, to wit, stimulant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Wherever the word stimulant is used without a particular quali∣fication of its degree, the degree is understood to be greater then that required in the healthy state, as will afterwards more fully be ex∣plained.</NOTE>, and that neither their cause nor their cure differed but in degree.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="022373_0009_0FB86D10D9141EC8"/>
With respect to sthenic diseases, the nature of either the cause or cure of which nobody had observed; he had long ago understood that inflammation in them, as well as the other symptoms, were not, as had been universally believed by Systematics, the cause, but the effect: and that the inflammation arose from the cause, i. e. the diathesis<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">or habit.</NOTE>, and not even from it, unless very violent. In fine, he experienced in his own person, that catarrh was not produced by cold according to the common opinion, but by heat, and the other known stimuli, and was removed by cold and other debilitating powers. By which discove∣ry he was led to form a proper judgment of the catarrhal symptoms in the measles: In which he found, that a very great man who had improved the cure of sthenic diseases, but never attained to any knowledge of the asthenic, had been misled, by the alexipharmic physicians. And, as these symptoms are the most dangerous part of the disease, he was right in supposing, that the proper cure of them very much interested that of the whole disease. The conse∣quence of which was that it came out a demonstrated fact, that the refrigerating antiphlogistic plan of cure was of e∣qual service in the measles and small-pox.</P>
<P>In sthenic diseases he illustrated the cause, enlarged the plan of cure, enriched the knowledge of both, explained and reduced the whole to a certain principle; he distributed all general diseases into two forms, a sthenic and an asthenic one<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Sthenic signifies an excess, asthenic a defect, of invigorating power.</NOTE>. He demonstrated that the former depended upon excess, the latter upon deficiency of exciting power; that the former were to be removed by debilitating, the latter by stimulant, remedies; that the hurtful powers which excited either were the remedies of the other, and the con∣trary;
<PB N="ix" REF="022373_0010_0FB86D1202AF87D0"/>
and that they acted by the same operation with the powers which produce the most perfect health, differing from them only in degree. He extended the same doctrine to plants. He laid down a principle which is illustrated and confirmed by all the parts of the detail, and <HI>itself</HI> reflects illustration and confirmation upon every one of them. <HI>Lastly,</HI> he put the question, whether the medical art, hi∣therto conjectural, incoherent, and in the great body of it false, was not at last, reduced to a demonstrated science, which might be called the science of life<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">That question has been answered in the affirmative by every one who had been at due pains to understand the doctrine.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE TRANSLATION.</HEAD>
<P>A PRESSING, and very general, demand for an En∣glish translation of the Elementa Medicinae, made seve∣ral years before the publication of the second edition of that work, and successively repeated with an encreasing importunity ever since; a desire of spreading the know∣ledge of a doctrine, which had exhibited so many indubi∣table proofs of its importance and utility to mankind: an ambition, not quite extinguished by advancing years, do∣mestic cares, and a declining state of health, to get the better of the keenest, and most universal, persecution, that ever was raised against an useful and extensive disco∣very; the necessity for a translation in the present decaying state of the knowledge of the Latin language; the dan∣ger of the doctrine coming before the public from adventu∣rers unequal to the task; and some other circumstances, partly of a private, partly of a domestic, nature, with which it would be impertinent to trouble the reader; all these at last prevailed with the author to submit, for once, to a task, otherwise not desirable, that of translating his own work. Such a task seemed more naturally calcula∣ted to lay the foundation of the commencing same of an in∣genious pupil. But, as no one of many, whose literature
<PB N="xii" REF="022373_0012_0FB86D14F9A88368"/>
and knowledge of the subject completely qualified them for the undertaking, wished to supersede the occasion for his engaging in it himself; and as the courage of seve∣ral persons of a different description kept not pace with their affectation or interestedness; it is to be hoped the public will not be displeased to receive the work from the author himself. This performance is intended for the use of three sets of readers; those who do not readily enter into a thought conveyed in pure Latin, and who, there∣fore, might wish to be possessed of a translation for the sake of comparing it with the original, and, thereby, of acquiring, renewing, or improving their knowledge of the latter; those, who are only acquainted with such Latin, as has prevailed in modern times; and, lastly, those, who either cannot, or will not be subjected to the trouble of reading Latin at all, and who, surely, may, often be better employed.</P>
<P>Both this, and the original work, are intended not for the exclusive use of medical readers, but also for that of the public at large, it being evident, that, without e∣ven the exception of the professional knowledge of each individual, that of his own health is preferable to all others. And such ana <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quisition becomes valuable in pro∣portion to its justness and solidity. The public are pre∣sented with a work, that claims the merit of having redu∣ced the doctrine and practice of medicine to scientific cer∣tainty and exactness. With respect to the form, in which it is delivered, it is stripped of that jargon of numerous, unmeaning or misleading terms, and all that mystery ei∣ther in style or matter, that has hitherto rendered the pre∣tended healing art impenetrable to the most intelligent and discerning, and locked it fast up in the schools. No terms are admitted but the few that necessity imposed, and these are every where defined. The style is simple, and
<PB N="xiii" REF="022373_0013_0FB86D1B25A607F0"/>
suited to the simplicity of the subject. In the language and composition, as far as the thoughts, which are new throughout, and that restraint, which is inseparable from exactness of translation, permit, clearness is every where preferred to elegance, and diffusion to brevity.</P>
<P>The author, in prefixing his name to both forms of his work, has thrown the gauntlet to its numerous, but anony∣mous, opposers. They are, therefore, called upon, now or never, to disprove it, and the judicious and candid part of mankind to judge between the parties.</P>

<HEAD>THE ELEMENTS OF MEDICINE. THE FIRST AND REASONING PART.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>I. MEDICINE is the science of preserving the good, and of preventing and curing the bad, health of animals.</P>
<P>II. The application of the same profession to vegeta∣bles, should be named Agriculture.</P>
<P>III. Good health consists in a pleasant, easy, and ex∣act use of all the functions.</P>
<P>IV. Bad health consists in an uneasy, difficult, or dis∣turbed exercise of all or any of the functions. The latter respects diseases.</P>
<P>V. Diseases are either extended over the whole system, or confined to a part; the former merit the appellation of Universal, the latter that of Local.</P>
<P>VI. The former are always universal from their first com∣mencement, the latter in their course, and that but sel∣dom. The former are always, the latter never, preceded by predisposition. The originality of the former pro∣ceeds
<PB N="2" REF="022373_0016_0FB86D204C2613B0"/>
from an affection of the principle of life, of the lat∣ter from local injury. The cure of those is applied to the whole body, of these to the injured part.</P>
<P>VII. To the province of the Physician belong all the universal, and as many of the local, as first affect a part, and, in consequence of that, at last injure the rest of the body with some resemblance to the universal ones.</P>
<P>VIII. Predisposition to disease is that state of the body, that recedes from health, and approaches to disease in such a manner, as to seem still within the boundaries of the former, of which, however, it is only an insiduous and deceiving resemblance.</P>
<P>IX. These <HI>three</HI> states<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Of health, disease, and predisposition.</NOTE> constitute the life<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Or living state.</NOTE> of ani∣mals; to which that of vegetables is not dissimilar, but more imperfect.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>X. IN all the states of life, man and other animals differ from themselves in their dead state, or from any o∣ther inanimate matter in this property alone; that they can be affected by external agents, as well as by certain functions peculiar to themselves, in such a manner, that the phaenomena peculiar to their living state, that is, their own functions, can be produced. This proposition comprehends every thing that is vital in nature, and there∣fore, <HI>at least,</HI> applies to vegetables.</P>
<P>XI. The external agents in general, are reducible to heat, diet,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Consisting of food, drink, and condiment.</NOTE>, other matters taken into the stomach, the blood, the fluids secreted from the blood, and air. <HI>How</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="022373_0017_0FB86D2211B50138"/>
poisons and contagions come under the same view shall afterwards be mentioned.</P>
<P>XII. The functions of the system itself, producing the same effect, are muscular contraction, sense, and the ener∣gy of the brain in thinking, and in exciting passion and emotion. "While these affect the system in the same manner as the other agents; so, with respect to their ori∣gin, they arise both from the other and from them∣selves."</P>
<P>XIII. The result of withholding either the property distinguishing living from dead matter, or the operation of either of the two sets of powers, is the non-existence of life. Nothing else is necessary to life.</P>
<P>XIV. The property, by which both sets <HI>of powers</HI> act, should be named Excitability; and the powers themselves, Exciting powers. By the word "body" is meant both the body simply so called, and also as endued with an in∣tellectual part, a part appropriated to passion and emotion, or to the soul; the appellation commonly given to it <HI>in medical writings</HI> is system<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">No disquisition is here meant to be entered into, as religion is no where interfered with, but left to its proper guardians.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>XV. The common effect, produced by the exciting powers, is sense, motion, mental action, and the passions. Which effect being one and the same, it must, therefore, be granted, that the operation of all the powers is also one and the same<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">That is, since sense, motion, mental functions, and the passions are the only, and a constant, effect of the exciting powers, acting upon the excitability; and since that happens, whether one, or more, or all the powers, or which soever of them, act, the irresistable conclusion, that arises in the mind, is, that the effect of the powers being the same, the mode of operation of them al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must be the same. This mode of reason∣ing, which is certainly as just as it is new in medicine, will often oc∣cur, and, we trust, will stand the test of the most scrupulous scrutiny.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="022373_0018_0FB86D2360561380"/>
XVI. The effect of the exciting powers, acting upon the excitability, is to be denominated Excitement.</P>
<P>XVII. Since, of the same exciting powers, some act by evident impulses, and the identity of the effect of others infers the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame mode<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Or ratio.</NOTE> of operation; and since they have all a certain activity in them, they ought to be deno∣minated stimulant, or stimuli.</P>
<P>α. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>muli are either universal or local.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The universal stimuli are the exciting powers, so acting up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the excitability, as always to produce some excitement over the whole system. And their appellation of universal is convenient to distinguish them from the local.</P>
<P>γ. The local stimuli act only on the part to which they are applied; and do not, without previously producing an affection in it, affect the rest of the body.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>XVIII. WE know not what excitability is, or in what manner it is affected by the exciting powers. But, whatever it be, either a certain quantity, or a certain ener∣gy of it, is assigned to every being upon the commence∣ment of its living state. The quantity, or energy, is dif∣ferent in different animals, and in the same animal at dif∣ferent times. It is partly owing to the uncertain nature of the subject, partly to the poverty of common language, and likewise to the novelty of this doctrine, that the phra∣ses of the excitability being abundant, encreased, accumu∣lated, superfluous; or weak, not well enough sustained, not well enough exercised, or deficient in energy, when
<PB N="5" REF="022373_0019_0FB86D27B9410B20"/>
enough of stimulus has not been applied; sometimes ti∣red, fatigued, worn out, languid, exhausted or consumed, when the stimulus has operated in a violent degree; or be∣ing at other times in vigour, or reduced to one half, when the stimulus has neither been applied in excess nor defect, will be employed in different parts of this ensuing work. Both upon this, and every other subject we must abide by facts; and carefully avoid the slippery question about cau∣ses, as being in general incomprehensible, and as having ever proved a venomous snake to philosophy.</P>
<P>XIX. As there is always some excitability, however small, while life remains, and the action of the exciting powers in one degree or another is never wanting; the conclusion from that <HI>fact</HI> is, that they are all endowed with more or less of stimulant power, and that this must be either excessive, in due proportion, or deficient. A great quantity of blood stimulates in excess, and, there∣fore, produces the diseases that depend upon too much stimulus; but an under proportion of blood, though de∣bilitating <HI>in its effect,</HI> and inducing the diseases that de∣pend upon debility as their cause, must still be understood to be stimulant; but only so much more weakly stimulant, as the penury is more considerable: The same conclusion applies to all the other exciting powers, unless that poi∣sons, contagions, and some few other powers, might to some seem exceptions. But,</P>
<P>XX. Poisons either do not produce the universal dis∣eases, which make our present subject; or, if they do, by operating the same effect as the ordinary exciting powers, their mode of operation must also be allowed to be the same<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This proposition of frequent occurrence in this work, that iden∣tity of known effect, always produces identity of cause though un∣known, will be found to be a mode of reasoning of equal service in guarding our reader from the deceitfulness of abstract reasoning, and in leading him into a proper mode of investigating solid and useful truth.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="022373_0020_0FB86D2AE45F2070"/>
XXI. Some contagions accompany diseases depending on too much stimulus<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">As the small pox and measles.</NOTE>; others those that consist in de∣bility<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">As the petechial typhus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever, the plague.</NOTE>. If both these are the product, not of contagi∣on alone, but, by a conjoint operation, also of the hurtful powers that usually depend upon stimulus, which is a fact ascertained: the effect, therefore, in this case being the same, the conclusion is unavoidable, that their cause is also the same, and the mode of operation of both the same. It must, therefore, be admitted that the operation of contagions is stimulant<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">This is all that is contended for at present; the degree of their sti∣mulus will be afterwards considered.</NOTE>. It makes for the same conclusion, that no remedies, but those that cure diseases, depending upon the operation of the usual hurtful powers, remove those that have been supposed to be induced by contagions. Finally, the great debilitating energy, <HI>obser∣vable</HI> in certain contagions, does not more prove a diver∣sity of action <HI>in them,</HI> than <HI>it d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> in <HI>the case of</HI> an equal or greater degree of debility, arising from cold<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">At the freezing point, or below it, man, and similar animals of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm blood, could not live a second in a dense medium, such as that of water; but the animals of cold blood can.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>δ. It might appear to some, that a certain matter of food, not sufficiently nourishing, and therefore, <HI>of</HI> hurtful <HI>tendency;</HI> as also that emetics, and purgatives, and sedative passions, as they are called, might be thought to belong to the number of <HI>powers,</HI> the operation of which might seem so many exceptions from the ordinary stimulant ope∣ration.</P>
<P>ε. In general all vegetable matter, when depended upon alone for nourishment, is hurtful, at least, to those who
<PB N="7" REF="022373_0021_0FB86D2C9D50B708"/>
have been accustomed to better, and that by a debilitating operation; and yet even it, since it supports life, however incommodiously, longer than <HI>a total</HI> want of food, must, of course, be stimulant. But, if asthenic diseases arise from vegetable food, and not, to a certain degree, from want; that circumstance must be owing to a certain change pro∣duced in the system, by which the sum total of stimuli is rendered less fit to act upon the excitability. That such is the case, is proved by the most stimulant matter of food losing part of its stimulus by continued use, and requiring the substitution of another in its place.</P>
<P>ζ. In the same manner is the operation of emetics and purgatives to be explained, as diminishing the sum total of excitement; which depends partly on an agreeable relation <HI>that the exciting power hears</HI> to the excitability, or on an agreeable sensation. That it is sometimes the relation, sometimes the sensation, that acts <HI>in this case,</HI> is evident from the hurtful effect of things most grateful to the sense, as in the examples of the legumina, and other articles of vegetable food; and by the salutary effect of disagreeable things, as the several forms and preparations of opium: Both which produce their effect, the former by a debilita∣ting, that is, an insufficiently stimulant, the latter by a considerably stimulant, operation<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Suppose a certain power, as 40, to mark the degree, in which the sum total of proper stimulant operation consists, and the excitement, produced to that degree, to arise from different exciting powers, all of them conducing to the same effect, by the operation of each bearing an agreeable relation to the excitability, or producing an agreeable sensa∣tion on it; the inference to be drawn from that fact is, that a certain suitableness in the mixture of the whole to the excitability, as well as the degree of stimulus, produces the effect. Again, suppose certain in∣gredients, which cannot be denied to be stimulant, added to this given mixture, the effect of the added article will be one of two: it will either increase the excitement first produced, without altering the agreeable state which that had induced; or it will, still without any reason for supposing it not stimulant, diminish the excitement that had arisen from the combination of the agreeable articles. And this will happen merely from the effect of a discordant combination of exciting powers, while that, which diminishes the exciting effect of the others, as well as these others, that constituted its given sum, are both stimulant; but the for∣mer in a higher, the latter in a lower degree▪ and therefore acting over all as debilitating powers. Mustard taken with meat, or onions with beef-stakes, are agreeable to most tastes; but they are, though still stimu∣lant, disagreeable to others, and debilitating. Peas-soup and peas-pud∣ding, though, independent of the animal juice infused into them, they are far from being salutary, will be bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by many; while in others, es∣pecially those who have been accustomed to more stimulant meals, and in persons who are gouty, and liable to complaints of the first passages, they will produce morbid affection. The same thing is to be said of beef-steaks with onions, which agree with the sound state, and disagree with that of the first passages just now mentioned. With regard to all these enfeebling matters, there is no question about their being stimu∣lant; the whole effect is to be referred to their rendering a mixture, stimulant in a certain degree, less so.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="022373_0022_0FB86D2DC5BE90D8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The sedative affections, as they are called, are only a lesser degree of the exciting ones. Thus fear and grief are only diminutions<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Not passions different in kind.</NOTE>, or lower degrees, of confidence and joy. The news of money gained produces joy, and grief <HI>arises from</HI> the loss of it. Here then no operation of a nature contrary to stimulant takes place; it is nothing but a diminution, or inferior degree, of stimulant opera∣tion. The subject of the passions admits of the same rea∣soning in every respect as that of heat<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">The doctrine of cold as an active power, and, opposite to heat, is now aniversal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y rejected, and considered as only a diminution of heat.</NOTE>; and in the the same manner all the bodies <HI>in nature,</HI> that seem to be sedative, are debilitating, that is, weakly stimulant; ow∣ing their debility to a degree of stimulus greatly inferior to the proper one.</P>
<P>XXII. Since the general powers produce all the phae∣nomena of life, and the only operation, by which they
<PB N="9" REF="022373_0023_0FB86D2F39981C30"/>
do so, is stimulant; it, therefore, follows, that the whole phaenomena of life, every state and degree of health and disease, also consist in stimulus, and are owing to no other cause.</P>
<P>XXIII. Excitement, the effect of the exciting powers, the true cause of life, is, within certain boundaries, produced in a degree proportioned to the degree of stimu∣lus. The degree of stimulus, when moderate<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Of a middle kind.</NOTE>, produ∣ces health; in a higher degree it gives occasion to diseases of excessive stimulus; in a lower degree, or ultimately low, it induces those that depend upon a deficiency of stimulus, or debility. And, as what has been men∣tioned, is the cause both of diseases and perfect health; so that which restores the morbid to the healthy state, is a di∣minution of excitement in <HI>the case of</HI> diseases of excessive stimulus, and an encrease <HI>of the same excitement</HI> for the re∣moval of diseases of debility. Both which <HI>intentions</HI> are called Indications of Cure.</P>
<P>XXIV. This mutual relation obtains betwixt excitabi∣lity and excitement, that the more weakly the powers have acted, or the less the stimulus has been, the more a∣bundant the excitability becomes; the more powerful the stimulus of the agents has been, the excitability becomes the more exhausted.</P>
<P>XXV. A mean stimulus, affecting also a mean or half consumed excitability, produces the highest excitement. And the excitement becomes less and less, in proportion as either the stimulus is applied in a higher degree, or the excitability more accumulated. Hence the vigour of youth, and the weakness of childhood and old age. Hence, with∣in a more moderate space of time, a middle diet <HI>gives</HI> vigour, and debility is the effect of its being either too full or too sparing.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="022373_0024_0FB86D348E7F0770"/>
XXVI. While that is the case, every age, every habit, if the excitement be properly directed has its <HI>due degree</HI> of vigour <HI>accommodated to it.</HI> Childhood, and that weakness, which an abundant excitability produces, admits of little stimulus, <HI>but,</HI> upon less than the middle proportion becomes languid, upon more is oppressed. Old age, and that frail∣ty, which is occasioned by a deficiency of excitability, re∣quires a great deal of stimulus, becomes enfeebled by less, and overset by more. The reason for the latter is, that the excitability, without which no vital action is produ∣ced, does not exist in that degree, by which vigour of the functions is produced; while the former is to be explained from the exciting or stimulant power, without which the excitability is of no effect, not being applied in that degree, which is requisite to the vigour that it should give. The impotency of stimulus may rise to such a degree, as to pro∣duce death from its extreme under proportion. On the contrary, the exhaustion of excitability may go so far, as to extinguish life by the extreme excess of stimulus.</P>
<P>XXVII. The circumstances, under which excitement is produced, have two confining boundaries.</P>
<P>XXVIII. The one of these circumstances is, ex∣haustion of the excitability from violence of stimulus. For all the stimulant powers may carry their stimulant energy to that degree, under which no excitement will a∣rise. The reason for which is, that the body becomes no longer fit to receive the operation of stimulus; another ex∣pression for which is, that the excitability is consumed.</P>
<P>XXIX. The termination<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Or cessation, or extinction.</NOTE> of excitement, from the exhaustion of the excitability by stimulus, may be either temporary or irreparable, and may arise either from a short continuance of a high degree of stimulus, or a long applica∣tion of one the excess of which is more moderate. Both
<PB N="11" REF="022373_0025_0FB86D3818AA0A88"/>
circumstances come to the same thing; the high degree of stimulus compensating for the shortness of its application, and the shortness of its application for its greater modera∣tion in degree<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">A force of stimulus as six, operating for a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>space of time as one; and a force of stimulus as one, operating for a space of time as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix, will produce the same effect in wearing out the excitability.</NOTE>. The effect of the former is sudden death; of the latter a more gradual death preceded by diseases. And though a most exact measure of excitement were kept up, yet death at last, however late, supervenes.</P>
<P>XXX. Ebriety, debauch in eating and drinking, sweat, languor, heat either <HI>operating</HI> alone, or overcoming the effect of cold, dulness in mental exertion from excessive thinking, or sinking of the spirits in consequence of vio∣lence of passion, finally, sleep; all these are the conse∣quences of a short application of a high degree of stimulus, operating an exhaustion of excitability. The long conti∣nuance of a more moderate excess in the force of stimulus, is followed by the frailty of old age, predisposition to dis∣eases of debility, as well as those diseases themselves. The ultimate termination of both is death.</P>
<P>XXXI. When the excitability is wasted by any one stimulus, there is still a reserve of it, capable of being <HI>acted upon</HI> by any other. Thus a person, who has dined fully; or is either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atigued in body, or tired with intellectual exer∣tion, and therefore under a great disposition to sleep, will be recruited by strong drink; and, when the last has pro∣duced the same sleepiness, the more diffusible stimulus of opium <HI>will arouse him</HI><NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">A gentleman, engaged in a literary composition, which required an uninterrupted exertion of his mental faculties for more than forty hours, was enabled to go through it with alacrity, by supporting him∣self in this manner. After dining well and setting to business, he took a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of wine every hour. Ten hours after he ate something nourish∣ing▪ but spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in quantity, and for some hours kept himself up with punch not too strong. And, when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound himself at last like to be evercome by an inclination to sleep, he changed all his stimuli for an o∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate; and finished his business in forty hours. What he had wrote was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w to be put to the press. He had next to watch and correct the proofs, which cost him four or five hours further continuance of vigi∣lance and activity. To effect this he took a glass with the Master Prin∣ter, while his men were going on with their part of the work. The succession of stimuli in this case was first food, next the stimulus of the intellectual function, then wine, then the food varied, then punch, then opium, then punch and conversation.</NOTE>. Even after opium fails, and
<PB N="12" REF="022373_0026_0FB86D39CB688458"/>
leaves him heavy and oppressed by the same propensity, a stimulus still higher and more diffusible, if there be any such, will have the same effect. A person fatigued with a journey will be roused by music to dance and skip; and he will be enabled to run after a flying beauty, if her flight encourages him with the hope of overtaking her.</P>
<P>XXXII. The waste of excitability, first exhausted by stimuli, and then recruited by new ones, is most difficultly repaired, because the more a stimulant operation has been employed, that is the more the stimuli have been applied; there remains the less access to fresh stimuli, by the opera∣tion of which the failure of excitement may be removed.</P>
<P>XXXIII. The reason of the difficulty is, that no means of reproducing the healthy state, that is, the proper <HI>degree</HI> of excitement, is left; but the very circumstance that occasioned the waste, that is, already an excess of stimulant operation, not admitting of more stimulus.</P>
<P>XXXIV. Such, in fine, is the nature of the same loss of excitement, that it rushes to instant death, unless proper measures be taken to preserve life by a great stimu∣lus, but less than that which occasioned it, and then by a still less, till by means of the moderate stimulus, that is suitable to nature, or a somewhat greater, life may at
<PB N="13" REF="022373_0027_0FB86D3B5A97B188"/>
last be preserved. The difficult cure of drunkards and gluttons, already affected with diseases, sufficiently evinces, that the same consideration applies to all the ex∣citing powers that stimulate in excess<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">This proposition applies to the most difficult part of the practice for the cure of diseases, that is, those that depend upon a certain species of debility, which in the very next paragraph will be denominated <HI>indirect.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>XXXV. The excitability, thus exhausted by stimulus is debility, which should be denominated indirect, because it does not arise from defect, but excess of stimulus<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Like another debility, by and by to be spoken of.</NOTE></P>
<P>XXXVI. Through the whole progress to indirect debility, the second impression of every stimulus has less effect than the first, the third less than the second, and so forth to the last▪ which gives no more excitement and the effect takes place in proportion to the degree or du∣ration of the <HI>several impressions,</HI> though every one always adds some excitement. The inference from this proposi∣tion is, that, before the establishment of indirect debility▪ and, when it is now upon the eve of being established, the stimulus which produces it, should be withdrawn; a debilitating power should be applied, as in giving over drinking wine at the end of an entertainment, an substi∣tuting water in its place, and applying refrigeration to a person who has been exposed to an excessive degree of heat<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">A convalescent, from a disease of debility, was prescribed wine, but not to carry it to excess. A hiccup was the signal, by which he was to understand, that he had carried that stimulus too far. He desisted, and ended his jollity with two or three tumbler glasses of water; which prevented the establishment of the indirect debility into which he was about to fall.</NOTE></P>
<P>XXXVII. The same progress to indirect debility
<PB N="14" REF="022373_0028_0FB86D3CBA9C2A68"/>
is retarded by diminishing the excitement from time to time, and proportionally encreasing the excitability, and thereby giving more force to the action of the stimuli. Take for example, cold bathing from time to time, lowering the diet from time to time, and a similar abate∣ment of all the <HI>other</HI> stimulant powers.</P>
<P>θ. If cold sometimes seems to stimulate, it produces that effect, not as actual cold, but either by diminishing excessive heat, and reducing it to its proper stimulant tem∣perature<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">The principle upon which the operation of the cold bath depends has never been understood, and therefore all reasoning, as well as prac∣tice, with respect to it, has been conducted in quite a vague and random manner. Suppose a range of excitement, the middle and healthy point of which is 40 degrees of excitement, the ultimate degree of its excess 70. It is, therefore, the intermediate degrees between these extremes, to which the practice of cold bathing is applicable. From 80 to 70, the former of which is the head of the scale, and constitutes the range of in∣direct debility; and likewise through all the intermediate degrees from 40 down to 0, the cold bath, which is a weakening power, as well as every other, is improper. It is a mistake prevalent among systematic writers and lecturers, that cold is of service in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evers and other dis∣eases of the Torrid Zone. The truth is, that, in that country, there is no access to the use of actual cold. All, that can be done there, is, by various means, to diminish the excess of heat, which is constantly rush∣ing from those degrees of it which stimulate and excite, to those, in which its ultimate stimulant power destroys excitement, and leaves no∣thing but indirect debility.</NOTE>, or by rendering the body accessible to air, or by accumulating the excitability diminished by excessive stimulus, and communicating energy to the stimulus of the exciting powers, now acting too languidly. An in∣stance of this operation of cold occurs in the Torrid Zone, where actual cold is scarcely to be procured, in the use of refrigerants, as they are called, in fevers, and in the con∣traction, by means of cold, of a scrotum previously re∣laxed by heat. Nay, the effect goes so far, that sthenic
<PB N="15" REF="022373_0029_0FB86D3E65FDC0F8"/>
diseases may arise more certainly from cold, alternating with heat, and either preceding or following it, than from pure heat.</P>
<P>XXXVIII. The other condition <HI>or circumstance,</HI> limi∣ting excitement, is, an energy of the exciting powers too small, and therefore insufficient to produce excitement. As this case arises from a deficiency of stimulus, and an abundant excitability, it ought to be distinguished from the other, which supposes an abundance of the former, and deficiency of the latter. The same distinction is required also for the purpose of practice, All the exciting powers may fall so short of stimulant force, as to produce that ef∣fect. They all, therefore, equally serve to illustrate and confirm this <HI>proposition.</HI></P>
<P>XXXIX. In this case, the excitability is abundant, be∣cause, in consequence of the stimuli being withheld, it is not exhausted. Thus, in the cold bath, the excitement is diminished, because the stimulus of heat, and, therefore, the sum of all the stimuli, is deficient; and the excita∣bility, as being less exhausted by stimulus, is encreased<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><P>This is altogether a negative circumstance. The accumulation, encrease, or abundance or excitability, take any term you please, is not occasioned by any action or operation, but by the want of action, the want of operation. To form an adequate idea of it, suppose a scale of excitability of 80 degrees, as in the line here drawn.</P>
<P>EXCITING POWER.</P>
<P>0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80</P>
<P>EXCITABILITY.</P>
<P>80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0</P>
<P>At the commencement of life, the sum total assigned is understood to be 80, because no part, as yet, is wasted by the action of stimuli. Next it is wasted in proportion as these are applied from the beginning to the end of the scale. Its wasting is, therefore, owing to action and opera∣tion, but its accumulation to the reverse, the want of the action or ope∣ration of the exciting powers, as is expressed by the numbers placed a∣bove those first mentioned. Thus one degree of exciting power applied takes off one degree of excitability, and every subsequent degree im∣pairs the excitability in a proportion exactly equal to its degree of force. Thus a degree of stimulant or exciting power equal to 10, reduces the excitability to 70; 20 to 60; 30 to 50; 40 to 40; 50 to 30; 60 to 20; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 to 10; 80 to 0. And on the contrary, the subtraction of stimu∣lant power allows the excitability to accumulate. Thus, when the ex∣citement is at 79, constituting only one degree of life, take off one de∣gree of exciting power, and 2 degrees of excitability will arise. As 80 degrees of exciting power leave no excitability, so 70 degrees of exciting power leave 10; 60 20; 50 30; 40 40; 30 50; 20 60; 10 70; 0 80. Hence death takes place from nothing positive, but from the negation of the only means by which life is supported; which are the several exci∣ting or stimulant powers, now fully explained.</P></NOTE>.
<PB N="16" REF="022373_0030_0FB86D44A13D4ED0"/>
The same conclusion applies to famished persons, to water drinkers, to those who are in a state of refrigeration from other causes, to those who have suffered evacuations of any kind, to those who have <HI>neglected the stimulus of exercise, and</HI> given themselves up to indolence, to those who have neglected the use <HI>of that stimulus, which</HI> exercise of the mind affords, and to persons in low spirits. The effect of withdrawing any stimulus is the more liable to produce di∣rect debility, the more any person has been accustomed to a higher operation of it<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">For instance, persons accustomed to drink wine, and eat well∣seasoned nourishing animal food, will be more hurt by a water and ve∣getable regimen, than those who have not lived so high in that respect.

Something similar to this observation applies to most diseases.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="022373_0031_0FB86D47F46C0F28"/>
XL. As, during the encrease of excitability, the ex∣citement decreases, and in proportion to the encrease of the former; so that that process may go all the way to death, is a fact from which nature exhibits no exception. It is confirmed by the effect of all the debilitating powers mentioned above; every individual of which, as often as it proves urgent, has a rapid tendency to death.</P>
<P>XLI. The defect of any one stimulus, and the pro∣portional abundance of excitability, is, for the time, com∣pensated by any other, and often with great advantage to the system. So a person, who has dined insufficiently, <HI>and therefore not well enough stimulated,</HI> is recruited by a piece of good news. Or, if during the course of the day, he has not been sufficiently invigorated by the stimulant operation of corporeal or mental exercise, and consequently likely to pass a sleepless night, he will be laid asleep by a dose of strong liquor. When the latter is not at hand, opium will supply its place. The want of the venereal gratification is relieved by wine, and the want of the latter is made amends for by <HI>the use of</HI> the former, each banish∣ing the languor occasioned by the want of the other. The same conclusion applies to the use of stimuli, for which we have an artificial, rather than a natural, craving. The longing for snuff, when it cannot be got, is gratified by the practice of chewing tobacco; and, when any one is lan∣guid for want of tobacco, smoaking supplies the place of it. Nay, when the functions, as they often are, have un∣dergone a temporary lesion, and on account of that, there is no access to the use of certain accustomary and natural stimuli; the substitution of others, less accustomary, and less natural, supports life, till the desire for the natural sti∣muli
<PB N="18" REF="022373_0032_0FB86D48CB05F1F8"/>
is restored, and these are now in a condition to sup∣port the natural vigour as usual, and the health <HI>finally</HI> esta∣blished<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">This proposition is of the utmost importance, as holding out the true principle, upon which so many actions and feelings of human life, both in health and disease, are to be explained, and particularly as lay∣ing down an indication, which applies to 19/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;ths of all the sebrile diseases, and includes our artificial as well as our natural desires and appetites.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>XLII. As, in this manner, the superabundance of ex∣citability, proportioned to the deficiency of stimulus, may through all the degrees from its smallest to its greatest quantity, be worn out to a certain extent, by one stimulus, and then another, and the danger <HI>of its morbid</HI> accumulati∣on awarded, till the sum of it be brought down to that, which is suitable to health; so, the more abundant the <HI>same</HI> excitabilty is, that is the more stimuli are withdrawn, or the greater penury of the most powerful stimuli is; the less recourse can be had to that mediocrity of excitability on which the vigour of life depends; and the weakness may go to that pitch, the excitability arrive at that degree of abundance, that the <HI>loss of</HI> excitement may at last be∣come irreparable. This proposition is both illustrated and confirmed by the use of every debilitating power; as is ex∣emplified by cold, famine, thirst, and <HI>the progress of</HI> fe∣vers.</P>
<P>XLIII. This superabundant excitability proceeds with such rapidity to death, that the only means of restoring health, is first to encounter it with a very small <HI>dose of</HI> dif∣fusible stimulus, <HI>a dose</HI> scarcely exceeding the scanty<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Or under-proportioned.</NOTE> por∣portion of stimulus, that occasioned it; then, after wasting a part of the superabundance, to proceed to somewhat a stronger dose <HI>of the stimulus;</HI> and in that manner to be con∣stantly taking off whatever superfluity still remains, till at
<PB N="19" REF="022373_0033_0FB86D4A4C285DA0"/>
last the salutary mediocrity is regained. This state is the converse of that debility, which arises from a worn-out ex∣citability<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">An instance of a worn-out excitability is that debility which ari∣ses from intoxication; one of an accumulated excitability is that which dram-drinkers experience the day after a debauch, in consequence of which their hands shake till they are re-excited by their favorite cor∣dial.</NOTE>, and the danger of death occasioned by it. <HI>To give examples,</HI> a famished person is not immediately to be gratified with a full meal; a person afflicted with a long duration or high degree of thirst, is not immediately indulged with a large draught: but the former should be given bit by bit, the latter drop by drop, then both of them gradually more plentifully. A person benumbed with cold should gradually receive the cherishment of heat. Every person, thoroughly penetrated with grief, sorrow, or any high dejection of mind, should have good news gradually communicated to him. The news of the safety of the Ro∣man soldier, who survived the disaster of his countrymen at Cannae, should have been communicated to the mother in a round-about way, at first as having no better founda∣tion than doubtful report, then as being somewhat more to be depended on, afterwards as having still a greater ap∣pearance of certainty, finally, as not admitting a shadow of doubt: and last of all, before her son was introduced to her, the woman should have been at the same time for∣tified<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Had a part of her abundant excitability taken off.</NOTE> both by other stimuli, and a glass of Falerni∣an wine.</P>
<P>XLIV. Since all life consists in stimulus, and both the over-abundance and deficiency of it is productive of diseases, and in <HI>exact</HI> proportion to the over-abundance or deficiency; it follows, that the remedies of both these deviations from the <HI>proper</HI> standard should be accommodated to their degree;
<PB N="20" REF="022373_0034_0FB86D4BC294CC10"/>
and that a high sum total of stimulus, through the course of the disease, should be applied to a high degree of debi∣lity, or, what comes to the same thing, to a very abun∣dant excitability; but, that the quantity to be applied at any <HI>particular</HI> time should be in the same proportion small that the excitability is abundant.</P>
<P>XLV. The debility arising from defect of stimulus, merits the appellation of DIRECT; because it happens in consequence of no positive hurtful power, but from a sub∣duction of the necessary supports of life.</P>
<P>XLVI. Through the whole course of direct debility, e∣very deficiency of stimulus is encreased by a second, the se∣cond by a third, the third by a fourth, till the effect at last comes to be a cessation of any further excitement. This last, therefore, is never to be lessened and the debility encreased, with the view, forsooth, that in consequence of encreasing the excitability, the addition of a new sti∣mulus may act more strongly. For, as often as that is put in practice, the morbid state is encreased; and, if the debility should happen to be great, any <HI>further</HI> encrease of it may induce death, but <HI>never</HI> encrease the strength. For, while great debility, and, indeed, at pleasure, may, <HI>in that way,</HI> be produced; <HI>any</HI> excitement to be obtained from a stimulus to come after, is confined within narrow boundaries<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Suppose, that in place of an excitement of 40 degrees, the ex∣citement is gone down to XXX, and the excitability mounted up to L, and a debilitating power, such as the cold bath, or any of those that are just now to be mentioned in the text, has been superadded, reducing the excitement to XXV, and accumulating the excitability to LV. Suppose also, that any stimulus is next employed, with a view to raise the excitement, and sink or reduce the excitability; what will be the re∣sult? As an accumulated excitability admits of a very small degree of stimulus at any given time, while the accumulation of excitability, and sinking of excitement, even to death itself, can be effected in the short∣est space of time, and by any one of the debilitating powers; conse∣quently, the loss of vigour by the first practice, and the reparation of it by the last, will bear no proportion to one another; there will be no possibility of regaining the vigour thrown away, much less any hope of procuring more than existed before it was lowered.</NOTE>.

For the cure of diseases within this latter range, all the di∣rectly debilitating powers are proper, and, for the most part, they only; because there is no access to the use of the indirectly debilitating powers, till they have run their full course of stimulant operation from 40 to 70, at which last only they become debilitating; and, though sometimes, and under certain circumstances, they may be employed, the safest general rule is to avoid them.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Seat and Effects of Excitability.</HEAD>
<P>XLVIII. THE seat of excitability in the living body<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Called system by medical writers.</NOTE>, is medullary nervous matter, and muscular solid; to which the appellation of nervous system may be given. The excitability <HI>is</HI> inherent in it, <HI>but</HI> not different in different parts of its seat. This fact is proved by the production of sense, motion, the mental function, and passion<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">That is, all the functions which distinguish living animal sy∣stems.</NOTE>, im∣mediately, instantaneously, and not in a series of successive operation<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">If a small quantity of an opiate, a large one of any strong spirit, taken into the stomach, can instantly alleviate an excruciating pain in a Part the most distant from that to which the remedy is applied, and, in a short time after, remove it altogether, as is now well known, how is that to be explained but by the above proposition; it being impossible to pretend that it is carried in the vessels? Nor is any other of the many hypotheses, that have been thought of for the solution of this fact, more admissible. Should it be imagined, that it moves along the nerves ac∣cording to the last opinion, we demand proof of that assertion; which has not yet, and will not easily be produced; while the fact just now assigned carries its own demonstration in its bosom. The question re∣solves itself wholely into the following solution; Why does opium at once relieve the gout in the stomach, on the external surface, and in the remotest extremity of that surface? Because the property in the living sy∣stem, upon which and by which it acts, is one and the same over all.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="022373_0037_0FB86D535E221C80"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Different exciting powers are applied to different parts of the nervous system, one at once to them all; but <HI>the mode</HI> of their application is such, that, wherever they are applied, every one immediately affects the whole excitability.</P>
<P>XLIX. Every one of the same powers always affects some part more than any other, <HI>in which respect</HI> one pow∣er <HI>affects</HI> one part <HI>more than any other,</HI> another another, <HI>with the same</HI> inequality. The affected part is generally that to which any of the powers is directly applied.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And besides that, the more excitability has been assigned to any part from the beginning <HI>of the living state,</HI> that is, the more vivid and sensible it is, the operation up∣on it of each exciting power, whether acting with due force, or in excess, or in defect, and through all the interminate degrees <HI>of its action,</HI> becomes more powerful<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">That is to say, if the exciting power acts with that force which produces health, the degree of its action is greater upon the given than any other part; as also when its action is either greater or less than that of the middle salutary degree.</NOTE>. Thus the brain and alimentary canal possesses more vivid exci∣tability, that is, more propensity to life, than other inter∣nal parts; and the parts below the nails, than other exter∣nal parts. Again, while the fact just now related is such, a sit has been stated, the affection of the part bears no pro∣portion to that diffused over the whole body.</P>
<P>L. An estimate may be formed of the degree of affecti∣on in the part more affected <HI>than any other,</HI> and of that which is diffused over the whole body, by comparing the affection of the former with as many lesser affections, ta∣ken together, as equal the number of parts in all the rest of the body. Suppose the greater affection of a part<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">As the inflammation of the lungs in peripneumony, the inflam∣mation of the foot in the gout, the effusion of water into a general or par∣ticular cavity in dropsy.</NOTE>
<PB N="24" REF="022373_0038_0FB86D557294E9E0"/>
to be as 6, and the lesser affection of every other part to be 3▪ and the number of the parts less affected to amount to 1000<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Which is keeping greatly within the truth.</NOTE>; then it <HI>will follow, that</HI> the ratio of affection, confined to the part, to the affection of all the rest of the body, will be as 6 to 3000. This estimate, or something very like to it, is proved by <HI>the effect of</HI> the exciting hurt∣ful powers, which always act upon the whole body<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">The hurtful powers which produce peripneumony, in common English, the inflammation of the lungs, are excess in eating, drinking, exposure to heat, or to the alternation of heat with cold, an over pro∣portion of blood from inactivity, or an encreased velocity of its motion from violent labour, &amp;c. the effect of any or all which must fall as much upon every other part of the system as upon a small portion of extreme vessels in the lungs, and therefore the morbid affection produced cannot be confined to the latter, but must be extended to the former. The whole body must partake of the morbid change; it must be one common affection pervading the whole. If this is not probation, let any thing left on record by authors, or any living physician, produce a single hurt∣ful power, that, without affecting the system over all, can penetrate in∣to the the inmost recesses of the lungs, and there produce an inflamma∣tion. I shall be content with one such hurtful power, and in exchange for it, when produced, give up my whole doctrine.</NOTE>; and by <HI>that of</HI> the remedies, which always remove the effect of the hurtful powers from the whole body<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Here too I throw the gauntlet. Find a single remedy which re∣moves the disease by an operation confined to the lungs. There is not one.</NOTE>, in every general disease<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">A wound in the lungs, among other effects of it, may produce an inflammation. But that is not a peripneumony, or a general disease at all. It is, on the contrary, a local one, arising from a local cause, and to be removed by local remedies, if access could be had to them. And though nothing has been more common than blending such cases of local and general diseas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, at the same time no error that has hitherto crept into the art, needs more to be corrected. Such an accident is as much a peripneumony, as an inflammation from a contusion in the foot is a gout, or the swelled legs of women heavy with child is dropsy. But of all this more hereafter.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="022373_0039_0FB86D570CB6B320"/>
LI. In this way temperature affects the surface of the body; diet the stomach, and the rest of the same cannal; the blood and other fluids their respective vessels; labour and rest the vessels again, and fibres of the muscles: passion and exertion in thinking, the brain; all these af∣fect the part mentioned, each that upon which its action is exerted, more than any other equal part.</P>
<P>LII. Instances of a greater excitement of a part then <HI>of the rest of the body,</HI> are found in sweat in a person in health, flowing first from the brow under exercise, in checked perspiration, in inflammation or an affection analagous to it in diseases, in head-ach and delirium. Proofs of a lesser excitement in a part, are excessive perspira∣tion and sweat not occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sioned by labour or heat, es∣pecially when it is cold and clammy, profusion of the other excretions, spasm, convulsion, partial palsy, weak∣ness or confusion of intellect, <HI>and again</HI> delirium.</P>
<P>LIII. As the operation of the general powers, whether exciting in excess, in due proportion, or in defect, is di∣rected to some one part a little more, than to any other equal part; <HI>it is next to be observed,</HI> that it must be of the same kind in that part as in the rest, and as well as the general <HI>operation,</HI> be either in excess, or in just pro∣portion or deficient, but never of an opposite <HI>nature.</HI> For as the exciting powers are the same, and the excitabi∣lity every where the same, it is impossible that the effect should not be the same. The excitement, therefore, is never encreased in a part, while it is diminished in the gene∣ral system—nor diminished, while the general excitement is encreased. There is no difference <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but one of de∣gree; nor can different effects flow from one and the same cause.</P>
<P>λ▪ For though, an account of the great sensibility of
<PB N="26" REF="022373_0040_0FB86D5894F8AAE8"/>
certain parts, (for instance, the stomach<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">For the same reason, i. e. the sensibility of the genital system, wine and other strong liquors, as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, operate indirect debi∣lity sooner upon these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, and the for∣cible energy of the exciting powers, either in stimulating or debilitating, exerted on them, these parts run sooner than most others either into direct or indirect debility, or into a great encrease of excitement; that however is only <HI>a matter</HI> of short duration, and it is not long before the rest of the functions are hurried into the same estate. Thus, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and other similar symptoms, produced by strong drink and opiates; as well as the same affections apparently, and the gout, colic, gripes, and other similar symptoms, occasioned by abstinence and water drin∣king; likewise good appetite, and the removal of the tur∣bulent symptoms of the stomach and intestines, which we have mentioned, taking place in the convalescent state, in consequence of a proper administration of food, drink, and diffusible stimulants: <HI>all these</HI> are shortly followed by a similar state of the rest of the body, and the establishment of indirect debility is the consequence of the first case; that of direct debility <HI>succeeds</HI> to the second, and health over all is the termination of the last.</P>
<P>LIV. A part, therefore, is the seat of no general affecti∣on; the whole body is the seat of them all; because, with the inequality <HI>above</HI> related, the whole excitability is effect∣ed in them all.</P>
<P>LV. Neither is the affection of the more suffering part the first, and afterwards propagated over the system; for this good reason, that, as soon as the excitability is affected any where, it is also and immediately affected every where. Both facts are confirmed by the operation of every exci∣ting power, affecting the whole body as quickly as any one part; by general morbid affections appearing equally soon

over all the system as in any part, and for the most part sooner<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">The pain of the thorax in peripneumony, which is the sign of the inflammation within, never appears so soon as the general affection, and in more than in one-half of many hundred cases, where this fact has been painfully scrutinized, it did not appear till one, two, or three days after the commencement of the general affection. Likewise the pain of the gout is not the first of the phaenomena of that disease. But all these, and many more particulars, will be brought in with more ad∣vantage in their proper places afterwards.</NOTE>. Therefore,</P>
<P>LVI. Every affection of a part, however formidable, <HI>occurring</HI> in general diseases, is to be considered as only a part of the affection inherent in the whole body, and the remedies are not to be directed to a part, as if the whole disease lurked there, and was thence to be taken off only, but to the whole body, to all which it belongs<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">When the affection of a part is external, and, therefore, accessi∣ble, the application of a remedy over it, in conjunction with the inter∣nal remedies, is of service, in consequence of their mutually assisting each other.

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Contraction and its Effects.</HEAD>
<P>LVII. THE intire and vigorous contraction with which muscular fibres are endowed, is in proportion to the degree of excitement upon which it depends<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">It has already been proved, that all the functions depend upon excitement, and therefore contraction among the rest.</NOTE>. This is proved by all the phaenomena of health and disease, and by the operations of all the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iting powers and of all re∣medies. Force and propensity to motion are the same. We must judge from facts, not from appearances. Con∣sequently,
<PB N="28" REF="022373_0042_0FB86D5D800BF298"/>
tremor, convulsion, and every affection com∣prehended under it, are to be imputed to debility as their cause. The hurtful exciting power is a stimulus uncom∣monly irritating to the part.</P>
<P>LVIII. The degree of contraction, that constitutes spasm, is not an exception from this <HI>proposition.</HI> It is a continued and deficient function, rather than a great and exact one; and in so far as it is a great contraction, it depends upon the local stimulus of distention, or of some∣thing resembling distention, it consists in diminished ex∣citement, is devoid of force, and removed by stimulant remedies. The appearance of symptoms, which is ever misleading, is never to be trusted in forming any judge∣ment. Take now both the fact and the explanation of it.</P>
<P>LIX. As the degree of contraction, in so far as it is a sound function, is connected with force; from that we are to hold it as a certain and demonstrated fact, that the density of muscular fibres considered as simple solids, is proportioned to the degree of their contraction.</P>
<P>LX. It must therefore be admitted, that excitement is the cause of density. And the density is rendered grea∣ter and greater by the excitement in proportion to the de∣gree of the latter: Which it is easy to perceive through all the intermediate degrees <HI>of strength,</HI> from <HI>the highest, or that</HI> which takes place in madness, and the density cor∣responding to it, to <HI>the lowest,</HI> or that debility which is discerned in the article of death, in death itself, and after death, with a laxity corrresponding to it. That this is the fact, is proved by the weakness of the same fibres in their dead, and their strength in their living state; the only cause of which difference, we know for certain, is excitement<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Experiments have been made by Baron Haller and others, to as∣certain the comparative strength of muscular fibres, and the criterion of judgment was their greater or lesser disposition to break by appended weights; but the power by which any body resists stretching, is the density of that body. Those experiments show that the fibres in the li∣ving body are prodigiously stronger than the dead.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>The forms of Diseases and Predisposition.</HEAD>
<P>LXII. EXCITEMENT, the effect of the exciting powers, when <HI>of a</HI> proper <HI>degree,</HI> constitutes health; when <HI>either</HI> excessive or deficient, <HI>it proves the occasion of</HI> disease, and, of predisposition previous <HI>to the arrival of disease.</HI> The state both of the simple solids and fluids follows that of health as constituted by the excitement, and a given state<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This proposition overturns the principal systems that have ever appeared in the profession of medicine. But more of it after.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>μ. The first cause of the formation of simple solids, and the sole one of their preservation after, is the excite∣ment. Under the direction of the excitement, the living solids produce the blood from an external matter taken in∣to <HI>the system,</HI> keep it in motion, form its mixture, secrete from it various fluids, excrete them; absord others, and circulate and expel them from the body. It is the excite∣ment alone, thro' its varying degrees, that produces either health, diseases, or the return of the found state. It alone governs both universal and local diseases. Neither of
<PB N="30" REF="022373_0044_0FB86D617A3C9990"/>
which ever arise from faults of the solids or fluids, but al∣ways either from encreased or diminished excitement. The cure of neither is to be directed to the state of the solids or fluids, and only diminution or the encrease of excitement. But,</P>
<P>LXIII. Affections peculiar to parts, or organic mala∣dies, being foreign from this place of the work, in which the treatment of the general state of the body is only consi∣dered, must be passed over at present.</P>
<P>LXIV. That the excitement governs all life is proved by the exciting powers, acting always by stimulating, and thereby producing excitement; it is proved by the great∣er or smaller activity of the functions being proportion∣ed to the force of the exciting powers; it is proved by the effect of the remedies, which always oppose deficient, to excessive, and excessive, to deficient excitement, in <HI>ef∣fecting</HI> the cure of diseases.</P>
<P>LXV. The notion of health and disease being different states, is disproved by the operation of the powers which produce them, and those that remove them, being one and the same.</P>
<P>LXVI. The general diseases, arising from excessive excitement, are called sthenic<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Their old name is phlogistic; but as that word is absurdly meta∣phorical from an old notion of that sort of diseases depending upon fire or flame; and because it was not a proper contrast to the term here to be opposed to it; as also because it is still more ridiculous when applied to plants, which are comprehended in this doctrine; for these reasons it has been thought proper to reject it, and substitute the other in its place.</NOTE>; those that origi∣nate from a deficient excitement, asthenic. Hence there are two forms of diseases, and both are always pre∣ceded by predisposition.</P>
<P>LXVII. That the origin of diseases, and predisposition <HI>just now</HI> mentioned, is the only one and true, is pro∣ved by the same powers which produce any disease, or
<PB N="31" REF="022373_0045_0FB86D6357F25B18"/>
predisposition, also producing the whole form of diseases to which it belongs; and by the same remedies, which cure any disease, or predisposition, also curing all the dis∣eases and predispositions of its respective form<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">The same hurtful powers produce, and the same remedies re∣move, both Catarrh and Peripneumony, only differing in degree. The powers producing them are excess in the use of stimulants, and the re∣medies whatever moderates that excess. Evacuation, cold, and starving, are the means. All the difference is, that more of the means are em∣ployed for the cure of Peripneumony than for that of Catarrh. The hurtful powers producing indigestion and fevers, are also the same, to wit, debilitating; and the remedies the same, to wit stimulant. Only a small degree of the remedies, proportioned to the slightness of the de∣gree of the cause, is sufficient for the cure of indigestion; while the most diffusible stimuli are required to effect the cure of fevers. Stimu∣lants, in one degree or other, make the cure of all asthenic diseases; evacuants and other weakening means in different degrees, form the whole cure of the sthenic form of diseases. Might not this have been known long since?</NOTE>. Be∣twixt these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pposite sets of disease and predisposition, per∣fect health is the mean, leaning to neither extreme.</P>
<P>LXVIII. The exciting powers, which produce pre∣disposition to diseases, or those diseases themselves, should be denominated sthenic, or strictly stimulant. Those that pave the way to asthenic diseases, or produce the latter, should be called asthenic, or debilitating. The state of the body producing the former or the predisposition to them, is to be called Sthenic Diathesis; that which occasions the latter, with the predisposition peculiar to it, receives the new term of Asthenic Diathesis. Each of these diathesis are a state of the body, the same with predisposition and disease, varying only in degree. Distinguish the powers that raise both the diatheses to the degree<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">or full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> of disease, by the term exciting hurtful powers.

<HEAD>The Effect of both the Diatheses, and of the most perfect Health itself.</HEAD>
<P>LXIX. THE common effect of the sthenic hurtful powers upon the functions, is, first to encrease the functions, then partly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> impair them, but never by a debilitating opera∣tion<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The inability to perform motion in peripneumony, arises not from debility, for two good reasons; first, no powers but those that pro∣duce all the other symptoms produce it; and the same remedies, that re∣move the other symptoms, are equally effectual for the removal of it.</NOTE>.

<P>LXX. If the just degree of excitement could be con∣stantly kept up, mankind would enjoy eternal health. But two circumstances prevent that. Such is the nature of the sthenic diathesis, that it wastes the sum total of exci∣tability assigned to every being upon the commencement of its living state, and, thereby shortening life often by the interposition of diseases, sooner or later induces death. Which is one cause of mortality.</P>
<P>LXXI. The asthenic diathesis is hurtful by not supply∣ing that degree of excitement, which is necessary to life,
<PB N="33" REF="022373_0047_0FB86D6602AB9418"/>
and thereby allowing the state of life to approach more nearly to that in which death consists. Which opens ano∣ther gate of death to mankind.</P>
<P>ν. Further diseases and death are the consequences of the change of either diathesis into the other. Either dia∣thesis, by means of the hurtful powers producing the other, when these are employed as remedies<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Stimulants are the proper remedies for curing the gout; but they may be carried so far as to produce so much sthenic diathesis as to border upon indirect debility. A consequence of which is vomiting, purging, a feeling of burning in the intestines, intermission of the pulse, and stran∣gury; which are only to be cured by substituting watery drink and low diet in place of those opposite remedies: Nay, the stimulants may be carried so far, as to effect the establishment of indirect debility. Hence, will arise paralytic affection, anasarca, dropsy, &amp;c. The evacuants and other debilitating remedies, by which the diseases of sthenic diathesis are removed, may, by being pushed to excess, produce the last mention∣ed diseases, as depending on direct debility.</NOTE>, may, either from accident, inadvertence, or design, be completely converted into the other; and when that has been done, and oppo∣site remedies <HI>to those, that in this manner</HI> proved hurt∣ful, are employed; it may, <HI>by a contrary excess,</HI> be turned back to the same state from which it set out<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Pushing the remedies of sthenic diseases too far, may reduce the patient to an incipient dropsy; and the remedies of the latter may be urged to such excess, as to pass the range of sthenic diathesis, and ter∣minate in indirect debility. A is affected with a disease of debility, where the excitement has gone down to 10, the excitability mounted up to 70, degrees in the scale. What is to be done? By a proper use of high stimulants the 30 degrees of lost excitement may be restored, and as many of superfluous excitability discharged, and the excitement and excitability made to meet again at the middle point of 40. If the remedies are carried up to any degree betwixt 40 and 55, they have gone too far, and produced predisposition to sthenic diseases; if still far∣ther, but not exceeding 70, they will have produced one or other of these diseases. But carried beyond 70, the diseases, which their opera∣tion produces, are those of indirect debility. Any disease of this sort, when treated according to a rule lately delivered, will be cured. But if the stimulants adapted to this purpose be urged further; the sthenic diathesis will again be produced; and the debilitating power, suited to the removal of it, may carry down the excitement below 40 into the range of predisposition betwixt 40 and 25; and then, by a further abuse of remedies, which should only be used in the range betwixt 40 and 70 the excitement may return to the same point from which it set out, to wit, the point of 10, and the excitability rise to its original point, that of 70</NOTE>.

What is wanting to a further illustration of it shall be given af∣terwards. An illustration of the change of sthenic diathe∣sis into asthenic is <HI>found</HI> in hydrothorax succeeding perip∣neumony. Again, the immoderate use of stimulants may convert any asthenic affection into a sthenic one; as when a violent cough, a catarrh, or an inflammatory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore throat, are induced in consequence of the cure of the gout, though proper in kind, being carried to excess in degree.</P>

<HEAD>Of Predisposition.</HEAD>
<P>LXXIII. Predisposition is a middle state betwixt per∣fect health and disease. The powers, producing it, are the same with those which produce disease.</P>
<P>LXXIV. The period of predisposition will be shorter or longer, according to the greater or lesser force of the hurtful powers <HI>that have induced it;</HI> and the interval be∣tween health and actual disease will be more quickly or slowly got over.</P>
<P>LXXV. That predisposition necessarily precedes disea∣ses, is evident from the fact of its arising from the same exciting powers, acting upon the same excitability, from which both health and disease arise, and of its being an in∣termediate state betwixt them both. And, as the excite∣ment of health differs much from that of disease; it is not, therefore, to be supposed, that the former immediately mounts up to the latter, and skips over the boundaries of predisposition: nay, the contrary is certain and beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>LXXVI. Contagious diseases are not an exception from this observation; because, whether the matter of contagion act by a stimulant or a debilitating operation, its operation is the same with that of the ordinary powers, that is to say, its cause is the same<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The small-pox and measles are cured by the same means as perip∣neumony or any other sthenic disease; and, excepting the contagious matter, arise from the same stimulant urtful powers; they must, there∣fore, with the same exception, be the same. The only difference is, that they are accompanyed with a contagious matter, and the other sthenic diseases are not. The amount of which is altogether unimport∣ant. For, if the ordinary powers have not operated, the affection does not come under the definition of general disease; none of the functions reading from their natural state, and the eruption amounting to no more than a slight local complaint. It is, therefore, only of use to re∣gard the general circumstances of these diseases, making no more ac∣count of the local part, than to consider, arrange, and treat it as such. It is well known, that, when by the means used for the cure of sthenic diseases without contagion and their sequel, eruption, the sthenic dia∣thesis is prevented or removed, the local part gives no trouble; and that the disease is never dangerous but from the neglect of that manage∣ment. But the management is nothing else but the ordinary one in any sthenic case. If it should be contented, that, all that being granted, still the eruption may contribute a little: Be that so, and it can be but very little; what is the effect? The cure shows it; which is exactly the same as in sthenic diseases without eruption. The disease, therefore, being the same (for its mere local part is out of the question, as only re∣quiring a peculiar exposure to cold, which is equally proper in every sthenic disease); every part of reasoning respecting it, and, consequently, that affecting the question about predisposition, must also be the same. If, therefore, other general diseases have their predisposition, so must the small-pox, the measles, and the plague itself. If it should still be said, that the eruptive diseases, though in other respects the same with the non-eruptive▪ differ, in so far as predisposition is required as a com∣mon circumstance between them; the answer is, that that difference only respects their local part, which, without the powers producing the disease, is insignificant and a mere local complaint. As general sthenic diseases, the small-pox and measles, and as general asthenic ones, conta∣gious fever and the plague, to the full extent of their generality, have their period of predisposition; we may have occasion afterward to esta∣blish the question about predisposition to them even as local diseases, but this is not the place for it; all that was required here being to settle the question about predisposition to them as general diseases. In the same point of view all that has been said of contagious diseases, will apply to diseases in which poisons may have been concerned.</NOTE>. If, as it sometimes happens, no
<PB N="36" REF="022373_0050_0FB86D70D31934B8"/>
general affection follows the application of contagion, if no undue excess or defect of excitement is the conse∣quence;
<PB N="37" REF="022373_0051_0FB86D7201DD1CA0"/>
in that case, the affection is altogether local and foreign from this place.</P>
<P>LXXVII. If poisons communicate any sort of morbid affection without predisposition, such an affection, for that very reason, is not to be considered as a general disease, as also for this additional reason, that <HI>the affection</HI> is neither removed nor relieved by the usual cure of general disease;s and the diversity of the effect proves, that both the cause and exciting hurtful power are different from the general ones. In one word, since predisposition and disease are the same, varying only in degree, the unavoidable con∣clusion is, that whatever, with a given force, produces the latter, <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> with a lesser force, will produce the for∣mer. The only cure of most poisons is their early dis∣charge from <HI>the system.</HI> And if, as often happens, others, by wounding an organ necessary to life, are not curable, but fatal; the effect of both is foreign from our present subject, and to be referred to local diseases.</P>
<P>LXXVIII. The only thing to be regarded in the powers producing either predisposition to general diseases, or those diseases <HI>in their full force,</HI> is the degree of the for∣mer<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">those that produce the predisposition,</NOTE> compared with <HI>that of</HI> the latter<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">those that produce the disease,</NOTE>, or of the in∣dividual powers compared with one another; for the pur∣pose of discerning the degree of hurtful power that each possesses, and the degree of curative means to be employed in order to remove the hurtful effect<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">The distinctions of the powers producing predisposition, and of those that excite disease, under the general appellation of predisponent or occasional causes have been multiplied and refined upon without end. But the whole system of remote causes, as they have been called, is false in its first idea. The hurtful powers, whatever they be called, that produce diseases, also produce the predisposition to them. Which be∣ing once admitted, as it henceforth must, the whole fabric of aitiology or of the doctrine of remote causes must fall to the ground: Conse∣quently, simply remote causes, not divisible into predisponent and occa∣sional; relative remote causes, or such as are so divisible; internal and external predisponent, internal and external occasional, causes; ap∣proaching causes, or causae propriories proximate causes, of which, not only one, but often several, are assigned to every disease, must cease in medical language, and the student's attention be turned away from the endless pursuit of distinctions without a difference, to the study of the solid and useful facts that nature holds up to his contemplation in great abundance, when once his eyes are fairly opened to behold them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="022373_0052_0FB86D737AA726E8"/>
LXXIX. The knowledge of predisposition is of great importance: as enabling the physician to prevent disea∣ses<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">from his acquaintance with the powers that lead to them.</NOTE>, comprehend the true cause of them founded in pre∣disposition, and to distinguish them from local affections, which are widely different from them<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Such is the simplicity to which medicine is now reduced, that when a physician comes to the bed-side of a patient, he has only three things to settle in his mind. First, whether the disease be general or lo∣cal; secondly, if general, whether it be sthenic or asthenic; thirdly, what is its degree? When once he has satisfied himself in these points, all that remains for him to do, is to form his indication or general view of the plan of cure, and carry that into execution by the administra∣tion of proper remedies.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LXXX. As the predisposition, to diseases, and the dis∣eases themselves, are the same state; a great criterion, by which general diseases may be distinguished from local ones, will be <HI>found in this single circumstance,</HI> that general diseases are always, local never, preceded by predisposi∣tion<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">An inflammation in some part of the stomach, or as it has been commonly called, "the Inflammation of the Stomach," as if it were always of the same kind, produces many symptoms, that bear so great a resemblance to general sthenic diseases, such as peripneumony, that by systematics and nosologists, it, as well as many other inflammations of internal cavities, have been united into an order of diseases, supposed all to partake of one common nature. The Gastritis, however, which is its nosological name, is essentially different, both from Peripneumony and all the other general diseases of the order with which it is associated, both in other respects, and in that of which we are speaking. As ari∣sing from certain local hurtful powers, it is not preceded by predisposi∣tion. So when I come to the bed-side of a patient under these circum∣stances, though I had no previous knowledge of the nature of his disor∣der, whenever I hear that he has swallowed ground glass, small fish∣bones, or, perhaps, a great quantity of Caien pepper, I can be at no loss to discern the nature of the disease, and to find, that it is altogether local; and that for two of the best of all reasons; first, the person ha∣ving been in perfect health immediately before that accident; and, se∣condly, that the substances which he had swallowed were such as would naturally divide a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound part, or, in the language of our profession, produce a solution of continuity in it. From this, again, inflam∣mation is an inseparable consequence. And it is equally an universa fact in the animal economy, that, when any part, whether internal or external, which possesses great sensibility, is wounded or otherwise inju∣red in its substance, the pain arising from the inflammation superinduced, spreads symptoms of disorder over the whole system, which are liable to mislead those, who are not in possession of the criterion we here point out. As such a case, then, it not preceded by predisposition, so peripneumo∣ny as well as every other sthenic, every asthenic, disease must, from the proofs of the universality of the fact, be allowed to be, it must be local. And here again we throw the gaunlet.</NOTE>.</P>

LXXXI. As the affection of a part is always the ori∣ginal source of local diseases, and as the distinctions, we have related, are established upon the solid basis of truth; it follows, that the following disorders must be rejected from the number of general diseases, how great soever their resemblance to them may be, and however much they may conceal their own nature. Whatever af∣fections, then, arise, from any state of a part, from sti∣muli, from debilitating circumstances (neither of which last produce any commotion in the whole body, or on∣ly do so in consequence of the force of the local cause), from compression of a part, from obstruction, from other diseases<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">whether general or local,</NOTE>, and not from the exciting powers

which produce general disease<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Let it here be added, that the powers producing general diseases, are those that act upon the excitability, and are, thereby, quickly com∣municated over the whole system; while those, that act upon the solid texture of a part, so as to cut, prick, bruise, or con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use it, &amp;c. are the powers productive of local disease.</NOTE>; all these must be re∣jected from the number of general diseases: and <HI>that for the most solid</HI> reasons; to wit, their differing from them in the hurtful powers that produce them in their <HI>true</HI> cause<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">The cause of the inflammation of the stomach has been menti∣oned. To concentrate it into a definition; it is a solution of the conti∣nuity of a solid part in the stomach, by mechanical or acrid means, fol∣lowed by inflammation and pain, and, in consequence of the great sen∣sibility of the part, propagating symptoms of disorder over all the sy∣stem. The cause of the general diseases here alluded to is an encrease of excitement, and the inflammation accompanying those diseases arises from that encrease.</NOTE>, in their cure<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">The cure of Gastritis, or the inflammation of the stomach, is to contrive means to keep the hurtful, and all rude matters, from coming into contract with the inflamed part, and leave that part to heal; taking care, neither to encrease the local affection by too sthenic a diet, nor to produce a tendency in the inflammation to run into gangrene, by the abuse of evacuations and other debilitating powers; and if, than which nothing is more likely, the acuteness or continuance of pain should at last bring on a state of general debility, then to use the palliative means of preventing that bad consequence.

<P>LXXXII. THE violence and danger of universal disea∣ses is in proportion to the degree of excessive excitement<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The excess is contained between 40, the point of health in the table, and 70.</NOTE> or its indirect or direct deficiency<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The cases of indirect deficiency or debility are comprehended betwixt 70 and 80.

<P>LXXXIII. The only diagnosis<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Diagnosis is the doctrine of distinguishing diseases from one ano∣ther.

That, however, has been found to be altogether a mistake in this work, in which the endless variety of general diseases is reduced to two forms, a sthenic and an asthenic one, without any other difference but what con∣sists merely in degree. The huge volumes of diagnostics are then in this chapter superceded; and much labour, not only irksome to the artist, but worse than useless, often pernicious to patients, is proved to be super∣fluous.</NOTE> of any importance is that, by which general diseases are distinguished from local, or symptomatic affections, throwing the whole system into disorder, with a certain resemblance to univer∣sal diseases. To execute which, <HI>the following marks</HI> are to be understood <HI>to suffice for</HI> the detection of every gene∣ral disease; first, its being preceded by a diathesis, and this followed by one similar to it, and removed by an ope∣ration
<PB N="42" REF="022373_0056_0FB86D7F25D8B0B0"/>
of the remedies of an opposite nature to that which occasioned the disease: while on the contrary, local af∣fection is distinguished, first, by the affection of a part, and the disorder of the system<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">not arising from any change in the excitement, but</NOTE> being such as may be traced back to that affection; and by the absence of the diathesis of the disease which <HI>the local affecti∣ons</HI> resemble, or only its accidental presence.</P>
<P>LXXXIV. In order to attain to this useful knowledge learn what is necessary from anatomy; waste no time in superfluous study in it; peruse the works of the illustrious Morgagni; dissect subjects; distinguish remaining effects from causes that have passed away; examine diligently very many bodies of persons who have been hanged, or have died of wounds, and are otherwise sound; compare these diligently with the bodies of those who have died by lingering and often repeated disease; compare every par∣ticular with the whole; guard against the rashness of form∣ing opinions, and, if you can, you will be among a very few, who have ever been able to do so; never expect to discover the cause of disease <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dead bodies;</HI> be circumspect in forming a judgment.</P>
<P>LXXXV. As internal local affections are often a cer∣tain taint that remains after general diseases have passed a∣away, it is therefore a matter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound judgment <HI>to under∣stand,</HI> that there is less or more reason to suspect the for∣mer, in proportion as the latter have seldome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or oftener preceded them.</P>

<HEAD>The general Prognosis, or general Judgment of the Event.</HEAD>
<P>LXXXVI. SINCE the powers producing sthenic and asthenic diathesis, always act upon a part with more force than any other equal part; it follows, therefore, that the danger of disease during the predisposition, and of death
<PB N="43" REF="022373_0057_0FB86D804D9CCD60"/>
during the disease, arises in proportion to the degree of diathesis, or to the importance of the part especially af∣fected. But, its degree being given, the more equal the diathesis is, the more safe it is. Nor does it ever fall hea∣vy upon an organ necessary to life, without instant danger. And hence it is, that peripneumony, apoplexy, phrenitis, erysipelas, and the gout, when the two latter affect the head with violence, are chiefly formidable.</P>
<P>LXXXVII. Local and symptomatic affections ought to be distinguished from general diseases, and the remarks made in the LXXXIII. LXXXV. transferred to this place.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>LXXXVIII. THE indication for the cure of sthenic diathesis is to diminish, that for the cure of the asthenic diathesis, is to encrease the excitement, and to continue to encrease it, till that degree of it, which constitutes the mean betwixt its extremes, and which is suited to good health, be replaced. This is the only indication of cure that universal diseases admit of.</P>
<P>LXXXIX. As both diatheses arise from an operation of the exciting powers, the same <HI>in kind,</HI> but varying in degree; so they are both prevented and removed by an ac∣tion of the remedies, also the same <HI>in kind,</HI> but opposite in degree, to that which produced them. As their cause, so is also their plan of cure, confirmed by an induction of proof<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">not one or two, but</NOTE>, drawn from the whole course of facts and phae∣nomena<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Suppose the sthenic diathesis mounted up to 60 in the scale; to reduce it to 40 it is evident, that the 20 degrees of superfluous excite∣ment must be taken off, and, therefore, that remedies operating with a stimulus, weak enough to produce that effect, must be employed: they are still, however, stimulant, and of consequence, though they re∣move it, still the same in kind, as the powers that produced the diathe∣sis; it having been proved, that they are not to be supposed sedative, both for the reasons already given, and for this addtional one, that proof has not been yet brought of a single sedative in nature. As their stimu∣lus, however, is less than that which is required to support the ordinary state of health, they are understood to be debilitating, and, therefore, proper remedies of sthenic diathesis.</NOTE>. The same debilitating remedies, which re∣move

All the difference betwixt this force of stimulus and that of the other, is only a difference of 40 degrees. As, therefore, the debilitating powers, though stimu∣lant, employed in the first, removed the morbid superfluity; so the sti∣mulant powers used in this case, called stimulant by way of eminence, remove the morbid deficiency, and thereby, restore the degree of ex∣citement, that constitutes the standard of health.</NOTE>.

These arise from ossifications in the large vessels next the heart, from tumors, whether schirrous or steatomatous, impeding by their pressure the return of the blood by the veins to the heart. It is the general case that is here allu∣ded to, and the public may depend upon it, that it is to be cured, but not by evacuant means, and, on the contrary, by the high diffusible stimuli, necessary to the cure of diseases of high debility, such as the extremity of typhus fever, and an expiring gout. All these are cured by high sti∣mulants.</NOTE>, as well as the gout, and fevers, both relieved and removed by the same remedies? And are not peripneumony, the small-pox, the measles, rheuma∣tism,

But all these remedies in the asthenic case encrease, in the sthenic diminish, the energy of life. In both cases the operation is a common one <HI>over all,</HI> nor is there any diversity but in degree.</P>
<P>XC. The remedies, therefore of sthenic diathesis are powers, exciting by a weaker stimulus, than that which is suited to health; and are in this work to be denomi∣nated, for the sake of brevity, Debilitating or Antisthenic Remedies.</P>
<P>XCI. The remedies of asthenic diathesis are powers, ex∣citing with more force, than suits the best health; to be named here in the practice stimulants or sthenic, for the more convenient distinction of them from the other re∣medies.</P>
<P>XCII. These are to be employed with more or less free∣dom in proportion to the higher or lower degree of <HI>each</HI> di∣athesis, and of the local affection depending upon it. And such a choice of each should be made in such a way as that the most powerful may be adapted to the most violent case. But the cure of any disease of considerable violence, and scarce of any at all, is never to be entrusted to any one remedy▪ The use of several remedies is preferable to that of one; because, thereby, their direct energy is ap∣plied to the system to a greater extent, and the excitability
<PB N="40" REF="022373_0060_0FB86D8A09835550"/>
is more completely and more equally affected. The per∣son, who means that his remedies should go to a parti∣cular part<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">and there, from a local operation, and not by an affection of the excitability, serve the purpose,</NOTE>, is equally wise, as <HI>any</HI> one <HI>would</HI> be, who, by cropping a twig, expects to eradicate a tree. What re∣medies are <HI>of</HI> general, what <HI>of</HI> local <HI>operation,</HI> shall next be mentioned.</P>
<P>XCIII. General remedies are those, which, acting upon the excitability, by an operation diffused over the whole body, reproduce the state of health.</P>
<P>XCIV. Local remedies are those, which act by a simi∣lar operation on a part, and, by an operation confined to that, restore the sound state.</P>
<P>XCV. Since every universal disease, every predisposi∣tion, depends upon encreased or diminished excitement, and is removed by the conversion of that into the degree <HI>which constitutes</HI> the mean betwixt both; for that reason in order both to prevent and cure disease we must always use the indication proposed, and stimulate or debilitate; never lay by, nor trust to the supposed powers of nature, which have no real existence.</P>
<P>XCVI. In the indication of cure, the only regard to be had to morbific matter, is to allow time for its passing out of the body. For whether it acts, like all other exciting powers, sometimes by a stimulating<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">as in the small-pox and measles,</NOTE>, sometimes by a debilitating operation<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">as in contagious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evers and the plauge,</NOTE>, or whether <HI>its action consist in</HI> only giving the peculiar form of its respective disease, and, thereby, adding a local affection to a general one; in ei∣ther case there is no room for a new indication.</P>
<P>XCVII. For if the disease, as a general one, be pro∣perly managed, every eruption, and its consequences,
<PB N="47" REF="022373_0061_0FB86D8B85161408"/>
every species of inflammation, every species of ulceration, give way to the happy effect of the general plan of cure. And, when a contrary event takes place in consequence of a bad method of cure, the local symptoms are propor∣tionally aggravated. This is proved in the small-pox long ago, and in the measles lately<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">After the discovery of the nature of the catarrh, the catarrhal symptoms in the measles came naturally to be enquired into. A full trial was given to the refrigerant debilitating plan, in the author's own fa∣mily, as well as among several patients, and lastly among near an hun∣dred patients in England, treated by the father of one of the author's pupils; who all did well, while others, who ware kept warm, according to a practice that Dr. Sydenham had left as he found it among his Alexipharmac cotemporaries, many died, and all had a bad recovery.

But the other cases are sthenic or to be cured in the ordinary way of bleeding and evacuation; while such a practice is certain death in it, as being not only an asthenic case, that is a case of debility, but one of the highest; and, instead of depending upon the affection of the throat, the affection of the throat depends on it. Give stimulants to the patients labouring under the inflammatory sore throat, and you kill them; bleed, purge, vomit, and starve, in the gangrenous case, and you ensure the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate. Such, however, are the diseases, that systematics, nosologists, and other strangers in the city of nature, have, from their ignorance of the place, in spite of their natural distance, brought all together. (See Dr. Cullen's Genera Mor∣borum, all the three editions, genus VII.) As soon will Mile-end and Knightsbridge meet; as soon will London place itself on the Calton-hill, and become an elevated suburb of Edinburgh.</NOTE>, and by

other cases of typhus, with a similar affection of a part. In the two last, the danger to life depends upon the degree of the general affection, without which there is no occasion for <HI>any</HI> apprehension from the local. And the same pro∣position is so true, with respect to the <HI>three</HI> former, that, though the <HI>contagious</HI> matter has been applied, yet, without the general hurtful powers preceding, no true general disease arises, the danger encreases in proportion to their violence, and the whole cure depends upon the general remedies. These are <HI>so many</HI> facts, that show, that no matter, whether of a contagious nature or not, contri∣butes towards the cause of the general disease, which it accompanies or distinguishes, or, if it contributes any thing, that in that it differs not from any usual hurtful powers.</P>
<P>XCVIII. As, both in overabundant and deficient excitement, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound perspiration is diminished during the predisposition, and suppressed in the course of the disease (which has been already hinted, and will more fully be demonstrated afterwards); it is, therefore, proper that it should be carefully supported and kept up, for the purpose of discharging every hurtful matter from the body. But neither does that suggest a new indication of cure; since the only means of effecting it are those, which otherwise remove both the diatheses in proportion to their force, and which are not serviceable as local, but as general remedies<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">The discovery of the support of perspiration upon a principle, which extends to all phenomena of the subject, was reserved for this work. The heating remedies of the Alexipharmac physicians were intented to sup∣port perspiration, and thereby, throw out a morbific matter: Which was a very unlucky thought in the sthenic diseases, the principal of which were peripneumony, of which we have already so often spoken; phrenitis, in which the brain was supposed to be inflamed; and the small-pox and mea∣sles; because the nature of those diseases, and the tendency of all the powers producing them, was to check perspiration, (see No. LXI.) from the excess of their stimulus; consequently, the addition of more stimuli, by way of cure, was to check it still more. But those diseases are only three out of the hundred of general diseases: whereas the followers of a great man, who corrected that abuse through a fiery persecution, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, against himself, went all into a much worse extreme. Their imitation of their master transported them into a rage to carry on the plan of promo∣ting perspiration, by the same means, through the remaining 97 of the hundred. And they succeeded with a vengeance. For, as it is the na∣ture of those diseases to transmit too great a quantity of fluids through the perspiratory pores, in consequence of the debility which constitutes their cause; certainly the encrease of that debility, that is to say, the en∣crease of the cause, should encrease the effect. Which it most certainly did, through all the systems that have appeared for more than a century past. This is intended only as a hint, to enable our intelligent readers to understand the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uller explanation of perspiration, which will soon follow.</NOTE>.</P>

XCIX. When any one, who during the former part of his life had lived luxuriously, has now, at an advanced age, either from intention or compulsion, abated a good deal of his usual indulgence, and <HI>yet</HI> preserves some appear∣ance of an abundance of fluids and of vigour; he must not, therefore, as is commonly done, be supposed to labour under plethora<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">or an over proportion of blood,</NOTE> and excessive vigour; but, on the con∣trary, unless there be a recent and evident cause for it, which is possible, he must be held for one who labours un∣der indirect debility; and so much the more, if, to hurt∣ful powers already too invigorating, in the number of which are all those which fill the vessels, directly debilita∣ting powers have succeeded: And it is not a debilitating or asthenic plan of cure, which would encrease the direct de∣bility, nor one too sthenic<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">or stimulant▪</NOTE>, which would encrease the
<PB N="50" REF="022373_0064_0FB86D94B2C792A0"/>
indirect debility, the principal part of the cause, and, con∣sequently, encrease the force of the disease: But it is a middle method, which is commonly called tonic, that should be pursued<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">The blood is made from the food, and elaborated by the powers of digestion; that is, the more nourishing food is taken in, and the more strength there is in the system to convert it into real blood, the more, and also better, blood will be produced. The quantity of blood, so produced, may go to excess, as well as every other exciting power, the principal of which it is. But the question is, when, in whom, and under what circumstances, is an over-proportion of blood generated? Common sense would say, not at the beginning or the end of life, when the degree of nutriment used is far from being so considerable, as at the middle and vigorous period of life. Again, which of the two sexes are supposed most liable to generate this morbid redundancy of the vital fluid? A simple creature, aided by nothing but natural sagacity, would be apt to say, the men; both because they eat more, and, from the greater variety of the modes of promoting digestion to which they are addicted, digest better. How medical systematics would laugh at such simplicity! How contrary that would seem to mystery, their Lydian stone, under which they think all wisdom so safely lodged, as to fear it would be dangerous to turn it up, and examine what was under it! What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of habits are most liable to it? Not those, who have the great∣est bulk of simple solids, whether they eat or not, much less those, who are liable to bleeding discharges, who can neither eat nor digest; but all those who eat and digest well.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>C. Since to the degree of diseases (under which, to make few words, let predisposition also be comprehended), the degree of curative force should be accommodated; in the indication, therefore, of cure, regard should be had to age, sex, habit, constitution, climate, soil, in fine, to the operations of all the exciting powers in general, of all the hurtful ones in particular, of all the remedies, whether they have previously been administered properly, or im∣properly,</P>
<P>CI. The subjects of direct debility are women, under
<PB N="51" REF="022373_0065_0FB86D960E571CB0"/>
inanition<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">or an empty state of the vessels,</NOTE>, those who have had an insufficient share of sti∣mulus; those who have a delicate set of solids; those who have been accustomed to moisture, whether from the climate or soil; finally, all persons in a languid state, without a preceding vigorous one, either from the powers that pro∣duced their diseases, or from the mode of cure employed to remove these.</P>
<P>CII. On the contrary, the persons in whom indirect de∣bility is prevalent are adult males; those who are full and over stimulated, and so much the more, the longer the latter has been the case; those who have formerly had vigorous habits; those who have been overheated, whether with moisture, without it, or from whatever source; in one word, all, whose former vigour, either from the or∣dinary hurtful powers, or improper methods of cure, is now converted into <HI>a state of languor.</HI></P>
<P>CIII. In the cure of indirect debility, whatever be its degree, from whatever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of excessive stimulus it has ari∣sen; of the stimulus, which is to be employed as the chief remedy, not much less than that, which produced the dis∣ease, should, at first, be used; and then less and less, till the disease is cured.</P>
<P>CIV. When the first part of the cure is completed, and the convalescent now can use the more permanent and natural stimuli, he should gradually be confined to them, and drop the use of the more diffusible; with this di∣stinction, that if he has been in the habit of using a conside∣rable deal of stimulus, he may be indulged in something extraordinary in that way for some time<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">This indulgence is chiefly intended for those, who have gone to some excess in the use of the stimulus of drink, and who still, without it al∣together, are not capable of taking enough of food and other durable stimuli for their support. The aim, however, of all such persons (with the exception only of those who are of an advanced age, or of those whose debility threatens to run a certain course), should be to lay aside the daily use of drink altogether, and to indulge in occasional approaches to excess as seldom as possible. Some persons, even beyond the fiftieth year of their age, when they found they could eat and perform all their other functions with vigour, have had the resolution to abstain from all sort of strong drink, not only with impunity, but with a most wonderful improvement of their health and vigour. Another advantage, arising from this management, is, that, whenever any disease, to which a person may be liable, (such as the gout, various affections of de∣bility, chiefly prevalent in the alimentary canal; in a word, the dis∣eases of either form of debility), either returns, or threatens to return; a return to the use of wine and other strong drink will then become an excellent remedy, and even supercede the use of the high diffusible ones. That practice would be attended with this further advantage, that, when the occasion that called for it was over, and the disease prevented or re∣moved, the person might again lay aside the use of drink, with all the good consequences he had formerly experienced from the practice, and thereby both prolong his life, improve his health, and enjoy the proper and vigorous use of all his functions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="022373_0066_0FB86D97F5294C78"/>
CV. The cure of the hurtful effect of any stimulus should first be set about by changing it for a lesser one, this for a still lesser; and the intention of cure should be always to pass from the use of the more violent and diffusi∣ble, which nature in her sound state rejects, to that of the more durable, and more suitable to nature when unop∣pressed, till the healthy state can at last be unheld by the usual supports<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">In many diseases of debility arising from a former excess, the sti∣mulant effects of which have passed away, the use of cold water, though in gratification of the patients craving, and of other thin potions, as well as of vegetable aliment in a fluid form, and of evacuation of every kind, is most hurtful.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CVI. In the case of indirect debility, when the view is to restore vigour, a debilitating plan of cure should be avoided; because no sort of debility is to be cured by ano∣ther, nor any degree of it by any degree of another. It
<PB N="53" REF="022373_0067_0FB86D9903A12B30"/>
is only in the progress to indirect debility<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Betwixt 40 and 70.</NOTE>, that directly debilitating powers are suitable for the purpose of suppor∣ting the vigour, in that case, in danger of being worn out<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">At 65 there are only 5 degrees of vigour left, which, either by a continuance of the same excessive stimuli that produced them, or, by the addition of a degree proportioned to that effect, would be worn out. Remove some of the stimulant powers, the excess of excitement will be diminished, suppose to 60; remove more of the former, and the excess of the latter will be further diminished, till the excitement is reduced to its natural healthy standard of 40. The state of excitement, then, within this range, that is, between 40 and 70, especially in proportion to the approach of the excess to 70, is that, to which only directly debilitating powers should be applied. In all cases above 70 where the excitement is gone, and below 40 where it constantly decreases all the way, till it is lost at 0▪ directly debilitating powers are pernicious. How had then must the only practice be, that we find in books and lectures, a prac∣tice transmitted from the first accounts of our profession, and which deals in the use of no other means but directly debilitating ones? Bad, indeed, must it be!</NOTE>: such as cold bathing, lowering the diet, weak drink, and a similar abatement in the use of the other stimuli.</P>
<P>CVII. For the cure of direct debility, we should begin with the smallest degree of stimulus, and then rise to the use of a greater and greater, till the morbid abundance of excitability be gradually worn off, and the health at last restored.</P>
<P>CVIII. When the disease arises from the want of any one stimulus, the return to its use should be gradual, and facilitated by other stimulants more powerful <HI>than itself.</HI></P>
<P>CIX. Also in this part of the <HI>general</HI> method of cure, debilitating, either directly or indirectly should be abstain∣ed from; both for the reason formerly given, and also, because the stimulant plan of cure, which is the only pro∣per one, when carried to excess, converts the sthenic dia∣thesis
<PB N="54" REF="022373_0068_0FB86D9A7AA8A5B8"/>
<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">that between 40 and 70,</NOTE> into the asthenic<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">between 70 and 80,</NOTE> and the latter into death<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">at 80.</NOTE> For which reason, while, on the one hand, the debilita∣ting powers, mentioned before, are to be avoided; it must, on the other, not be forgot, that the force employed in the cure should be accommodated to the degree of morbid state. The thirst, which is occasioned by debility, is in∣creased by draughts of cold water, is hurried on to<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">the higher symptoms of</NOTE> nau∣sea and vomiting; is quenched by pure wine, or spirit, which prevent the troublesome symptoms that would other∣wise follow. Pure wine<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">which is one of its principal causes,</NOTE> encreases the thirst, which proceeds from a sthenic cause, and excites the same trou∣blesome symptoms, which cold water does in the other case; cold water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates it, and prevents the future tumult.</P>
<P>CX. Since, therefore, the same powers excite all the phaenomena of life, and produce sometimes an excess, sometimes a just proportion, sometimes a deficiency, of life, according to the various degrees in which they are applied; and since the same observation extends to the same powers, when they are applied as remedies of dis∣eases; let it, therefore, be an universal rule, never un∣guardedly to convert either diathesis into the other. And, as every disease, that debilitating powers remove, is sthenic, every one, that is cured by stimulant means, asthenic; the knowledge of that may furnish the proper means of caution against mistake.</P>

<HEAD>Of the hurtful Powers, which produce either Diathesis, Sthe∣nic, and Asthenic.</HEAD>
<P>CXI. THE powers producing the state of the body, upon which the predispositions, to sthenic or asthenic dis∣eases, or those diseases themselves, depend, that is, that produce the sthenic or asthenic diathesis, are those which were mentioned before<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">XI. XII.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>CXII. Heat, which is necessary to the production, the growth, and the vigour of animals and vegetables, as also to the form of the elements<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">In a certain degree of diminished heat water freezes; but if such a diminution of it could be found as to freeze air, the whole fabric of the universe would rush into dissolution.</NOTE> from <HI>its action upon</HI> the surface of the animal body, directly stimulates the whole; an effect which it also exerts upon vegetables. From this action of heat there is no exception when it keeps within a certain range of scale: but when it is either deficient, where it takes the name of cold, or excessive, its effect
<PB N="56" REF="022373_0070_0FB86DA04DF159E8"/>
varies<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">as shall be shown by and by.</NOTE>. This stimulus, in a moderate degree, pro∣duces its effect in due proportion, in a degree above that <HI>the excess of</HI> its action is such as to produce more or less of sthenic diathesis.</P>
<P>CXIII. Because the action of heat is encreased some∣what more upon the surface than in the internal parts, where the temperature is nearly stationary, it, therefore stimulates more in the former than in the latter. Hence, in the phlegmasiae<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">diseases with inflammation of a part,</NOTE>, the inflammation is always external, The same <HI>agent</HI> encreases the tone of the muscular fibres every where, and consequently their density<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See Chap. V. Which produces a suppression of perspiration by some imputed to constriction from cold, by others to constriction from spasms; both erroneously.</NOTE>. Hence, as the diameters of all the vessels are diminished, so those of the extreme vessels every where, and especially in the skin, where a greater force of the cause is <HI>exerted,</HI> are often entirely effaced. But actual suppression <HI>of the perspiration</HI> is incompatable with predisposition, and arises only from the diathesis, when it arises to the just measure of disease<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">The perspiration is diminished during the predisposition; but the condensing power is not sufficient to suppress it, till it attains the degree of producing the disease.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CXIV. Hence in the measles and small pox, the irrita∣ting matter, together with the perspirable, is detained. And not only in these, but all other sthenic diseases, the perspiration is suppressed, the excitement both upon the surface and in the rest of the body is encreased, and catarrh particularly induced<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Cale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acients, or heating things, were one of the means that the Alexipharmic physicians employed to force perspiration; but the princi∣ple is now laid down, that shows they produce the opposite effect. Hence the merit of Dr. Sydenham in recommending cold both in the small-pox and in peripneumony, in which disease he took his patients out of bed, and placed them in an easy chair. Happy had it been for the profession, and happier for the sick, had he extended his improve∣ment to the measles and catarrh, and all the rest of the few asthenic dis∣eases, and stopt there; but by extending his antiphlogistic and refrige∣rant doctrine to the whole form of asthenic deseases, the harm and good he did were in the proportion of 97 of the former to three of the latter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="022373_0071_0FB86DA2DC488E08"/>
CXV. Heat, in extreme excess, whether it it acts hurtfully by its duration or intensity, constantly debilitates by diminishing the tone, and producing laxity instead of density. Which effect is somewhat greater upon the skin, to which the direct energy of heat is applied, than in the interior parts, in which there is little change of tem∣perature. Hence arises sweating as in the torrid zone; hence the diameters of all the vessels, and particularly of the perspiratory vessels are enlarged. Hence proceed the colliquative sweats in fevers, and a similar state of the belly. Hence, also, corruption of the fluids, and not from a state of them directly produced by corrupting pow∣ers<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">The idea of certain powers of a tendency to corrupt our fluids, and of certain others to correct that effect, and take off the degeneracy, long prevailed in the minds of systematics, and is not among many of their followers yet laid aside. Heat was one of the number; but that it acts so, is disproved not only by the explanation here given, but by the certainty of the fact, that the same effect is produced by cold, as well as every other debilitating power.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CXVI. The same power in the violent measles, in the confluent small-pox, in fevers, and in every kind of asthe∣nic<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">or disease of debility,</NOTE> disease, in which the perspiration is deficient, does not lesson the deficiency<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">that is, does not encrease the perspiration,</NOTE>, though it expands and enlarges the vessels, but, on the contrary, encreases it<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> diminishes perspiration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="022373_0072_0FB86DA441AD7950"/>
CXVII. Cold, inimical to animals, vegetables, and the elements, weakens the rest of the system, and still more the surface, the temperature of which it almost only diminishes, <HI>and it produces that effect</HI> always by a direct o∣peration, always in proportion to its degree. Cold e∣qually as excessive heat, produces atony and laxity of the vessels, gangrene, and the other effects of excessive heat<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">In Siberia the phaenomena of cold on the human body very much resemble those of heat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CXVIII. that these effects of the extremes of tempe∣rature arise from debilitating not generating putrefaction, from an affection of the excitement, not of the fluids, plainly appears from this; that other exciting hurtful powers, such as a famine, an overabundance of blood, as in the case of those who die of peripneumony, and similar hurtful powers, which neither have been, nor can be, be∣lieved to affect the fluids by any direct operation upon them<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Famine, acids, and cold, have all the same effects upon the fluids that the putrefying substances were supposed to have; but surely acids produce no putrefactive process; neither can want act as positive matter; nor cold be supposed to produce any such effect. In a word, any cor∣ruption that is produced, arises only from the weakness of the heart and arteries, predominant in their extremities. They cease to act; the fluids within stagnate, and, under the heat of the body, degenerate. This is the true cause of the corruption. And the remedies are not correctors of the corrupted mass; but whatever invigorates the whole body, and consequently the heart and arteries. Nothing can be more absurd than to suppose that a glass or two of wine and water, a little bark, and so on, after being blended in the whole mass of fluids, should go to a portion of fluids in the extreme vessels, even without the circulation, and, by mixing with it, change its qualities.</NOTE>, produce not the symptom of corruption, and all the rest of the symptoms, and the same stimulants, which remove the latter, remove the former. Nay, the supposed antiseptics, such as wine, Peruvian bark, acids,
<PB N="59" REF="022373_0073_0FB86DA616116230"/>
and other things of that kind, are either entirely destitute of that operation, or they ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther are given, nor can be given, in that quantity, by which they can have any ten∣dency to affect the mixture of the fluids: In fine the ef∣fects of inanimate matters upon one another are never, with any propriety, transferred to living systems. Though, then, the fluids are frequently corrupted, the corruption is the effect of weak vessels not giving a sufficient mixture or diffusion to them, but is never the cause.</P>
<P>CXIX. The disagreeable sensation both of cold and of heat in extreme, is also hurtful, by diminishing the sum total of stimulant operation, which, in so far as it is agreeable, is serviceable by stimulating<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See note (<HI>g</HI>) in par. XXI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CXX. As cold is naturally so debilitating, and all de∣bilitating powers diminish excitement, it is therefore, ne∣ver of service but in sthenic diseases, that is, in those which are in their progress towards indirect debility<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See CVI.</NOTE>; because the excitability, already too abundant, can never be ren∣dered more abundant, nor, when too much wasted, ren∣dered more accumulated, without an aggravation of the disease<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">XLVI. XLVII.</NOTE>; excitability admitting of less stimulus in pro∣portion as it is either more abundant, or more ultimately wasted. When the debility is moderate, a mistake of this kind is less evident: but in a high degree of debility of either sort, a violent disease, or even death itself, may be the consequence of the smallest encrease of debility<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">When the debility of the direct kind is very moderate, that is, the excitement has not sunk much below XL. in the scale, the short suspen∣sion of a few degrees more would not do much mischief. Suppose the ex∣citement at 30 instead of 40, and a dip in cold water has brought it down to 25, the effect even of that is not of a trifling nature; the debility by this means has passed the whole range of predisposition, and arrived at the degreee where disease commences. It is true the excitement will rise the moment the person is taken out of the bath; but still something is lost. The very accumulation implies a reduced disposition in it to be acted upon by stimuli. A person, who has abstained from any one sti∣mulus for a given time, when it is again applied, will not bear near so much of it as he did formerly. If he abstains longer, he will bear still less, till, at last, he will be sit to bear none at all. If, on the other hand, the excitement should have fallen to 10, an addition of debilita∣ting power would be attended with the utmost danger, not only of encreasing the disease, but of inducing death.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="022373_0074_0FB86DA74CCA7D88"/>
CXXI. As cold as well as excessive heat relaxes, a fact that is seen in the cure of the small pox, and of every sthe∣nic disease, from that we are to understand, that the pro∣perty of cold in constricting<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">or condensing,</NOTE> inanimate matter does not extend to living matter<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">It has been alledged, that the diminution of the bulk of the bo∣dy by cold, furnished an argument in favour of its being an astringent to it, as it certainly is a condensor of dead matter.</NOTE>. The diminution of the bulk of the surface<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">or shrivelling of the skin,</NOTE> arises from debility of the vessels, not sufficiently propelling the fluids, and filling the vessels. In this way does cold produce asthenic diathesis.</P>
<P>CXII. But, as always less and less excitement arises in proportion as stimulant operation has been applied, till at last no more at all is added; cold<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">on that footing of action,</NOTE>, as well as any o∣ther directly debilitating power, may, according to va∣rious degrees of it, produce health, and all the degrees of sthenic diathesis<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">from the highest to the lowest, from that degree of it, which, un∣der the circumstances here mentioned, produces a moderate catarrh, to that, where the modification of its action rises to the degree of being ade∣quate to the effect of producing a peripneumony.</NOTE>; <HI>in the following way, however, only.</HI> It stops the waste of excitability, makes the bo∣dy more susceptible of stimulant operation, checks the pro∣gress to indirect debility, and stems the latter.

effects that by checking the career of heat and other sti∣muli, which accelerate indirect debility, and by keeping the excitement within the boundaries of vigour. And hence vigour in cold countries, when the body is defended by <HI>clothes, the shelter of</HI> a house, <HI>the warmth of</HI> a fire, <HI>as well as</HI> by its own proper motion. Hence also the bracing, by cold, of parts that have been relaxed by excessive heat. Last∣ly, hence a remedy for the corruption of the fluids, <HI>which consists in</HI> invigorating the vessels, not correcting the degene∣racy of their contents. This effect of cold upon the surface, which is nearly the only part of the system subject to refri∣geration, is somewhat greater than in the internal parts.</P>
<P>CXXIII. the debilitating effect of temperature, and therefore also its hurtful tendency, is encreased by moi∣sture.</P>
<P>CXXIV. Of the articles of diet, the only food in dan∣ger of being too stimulant, is flesh and land-animal food, used in great quantity. Meat too salt, and hardened, es∣pecially when it has now begun to spoil, is an excep∣tion.</P>
<P>CXXV. The same thing is to be said of condiment; of which a very small portion, upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> account of its high de∣gree of stimulus, is sufficient.</P>
<P>CXXVI. Spirituous or vinous drink, in which the al∣kahol is always dilated, stimulates, more quickly, and more readily, than seasoned food, and its stimulus is in proportion to the quantity of alkahol that it contains.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But there are stimuli, which possess an operation as much quicker, and more powerful<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">than that of the articles of diet.</NOTE>, than these just now mentioned, and which are the agreeable <HI>and proper ones</HI> in health, as their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is of shorter duration.

<P>CXXVII. The stimulus of the articles of diet, not exclusive of the diffusible stimuli, should be denominated direct, because it acts directly and immediately upon the excitability of the part to which it is applied. The direct stimulus, at least in so far as it regards the food, is assisted by another, depending upon a distention of muscular fi∣bres, on which account, for the sake of distinction, the latter should be called Indirect. As the latter is affor∣ded by the bulk of animal and vegetable food, so the for∣mer is produced by a relation of the stimulus to the exci∣tability.

<P>CXXX.

But, in persons who have been accustomed to them, in the <HI>case of those who are</HI> advanced in age, and of those who are weak from that or any other circumstance, cold, watery, acid, or fermenting drink, has a great influence directly, and excess in the use of strong drink indirectly, in producing asthenic diathesis.</P>
<P>υ If the diffusible stimuli, after they have been employ∣ed, are too quickly withdrawn, they, in the same manner as the more durable, allow the excitability to accumulate, and direct debility to come on, and consequently may be said to produce asthenic diathesis.

And all the hurtful effects which they have most untruly, to the great detriment of mankind, been said ra∣ther, than are now said, to occasion, arise not from them∣selves, but from the want of knowledge how to manage them. And as this operation of diffusible stimulus ought to be supported by that of a durable; at the same time, it must not be confounded with debilitating powers. What disturbances, during the operation of opium, will not a breath of cold <HI>air,</HI> affecting the body, create? And how

Both of them require nicety and skill in the management of them for their cure; for which consult Chap. XI. from par. CIII. to CX. The management is out of our present question; but what affects that is, that, from this obser∣vation, we can clearly find, as it was to be expected from the analogous operation of the other exciting powers, that the diffusible stimuli, when their operation is carried to excess, will also produce an asthenic diathesis of the indirect kind.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>φ. Both the other diffusible stimuli, as well as opium, and the more durable one of strong drink, by an indirectly debilitating operation, produce asthenic diathesis.</P>
<P>CXXXI. A further stimulus is an abundance of chyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and blood; by this the excitement is encreased every where, and particularly in the blood-vessels, and <HI>encreased</HI> in de∣grees proportioned to its degree of abundance. The quali∣ty of the blood, at least, as a cause, is of no effect, it is the quantity only that is. The quantity, by <HI>its action of</HI> distending the muscular fibres of the vessels, acts with a constant impulse<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">The blood by its quantity distends the muscular fibres of the ves∣sels; that distention stimulates the excitability in the fibres, and pro∣duces excitement, commonly called their irritability; thus excited, the fibres contract; the contraction of each portion sends the wave onward to another portion: when the wave has passed any given portion of ves∣sel, its fibres again relax, and make way for the next, which is pushed along in the same manner. In this way the circulation goes on in all ca∣ses while life remains; contraction and relaxation constantly alternate; the former propelling the wave before the latter opens to receive the next. But the vessel may be in different states with respect to its power of either contracting or relaxing. When it is weak, which every part of the vascular system is as often as all the rest of the system is weak, both the contraction and relaxation of each portion of vessel is imperfect. The contraction from its smallness, and the relaxation from its being more owing to the passive state of the simple, than the active state of the living, fibres, leave betwixt them a large diameter upon the whole. But, in a vigorous, or sthenic, state of the whole system in general, and of that of the vessels in particular, the contractions are strong and forcible, and the relaxations active and in consent with the contractions. Hence the diameter of each portion of vessel is diminished upon the whole, and while the quantity of the blood is at the same time encreased, the action and re-action are great; the blood distends with mechanical, the vessels re∣sist with vital energy; the mutual effect of both upon the excitability is considerable; all is activity, all is force, and these are in exact proportion to their cause over all the sthenic diathesis. This state of the vessel, in so far as it respects the muscular fibres, is its tone; in so far as it re∣spects them as simple solids, its density. It is a sthenic state of the ves∣sel, opposed to the asthenic first described, which is distinguished by the epithets of atony and laxity; which, however, opposed to tone and den∣sity are only relative terms, employed for convenience, not absolute: like the term cold, used for diminished heat, they only signify a dimi∣nution of tone and density.</NOTE>.

<P>CXXXII. The effect of distention<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">that we have been describing,</NOTE> is encreased by the velocity of the blood, both as arising from other sour∣ces, and especially from that motion of the body which its own muscles perform, a motion, which, by compressing the veins, carries the blood more quickly back to the heart.</P>
<P>CXXXIII. Nothing is more effectual than these two <HI>last mentioned stimuli,</HI> in producing sthenic diathesis, and the diseases depending upon it. Those diseases are violent in proportion to the over proportion of the blood, and the rapidity of the force with which it flows; a fact, that is proved by all the exciting powers, all the symptoms of those diseases, and, especially, the pulse of the arteries;
<PB N="68" REF="022373_0082_0FB86DB7BA9158E0"/>
it is also proved by the great efficacy of bleeding, purging, abstinence from food, and rest, in the cure of the disease<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Relief from bleeding and other evacuations is certainly a good ar∣gument for the cause of the disease being so far owing to an over-pro∣portion of blood; and rest is as good for the proof of agitation of the ves∣sels being concerned in the cause: besides, exercise is otherwise a noted cause of quickness of the pulse: and the hurtful powers and symptoms are equally decisive.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CXXXIV. While an over-proportion and velocity of blood is a chief cause of sthenic diathesis; there is nothing more powerful in producing the asthenic, than that penury of blood which the greatest celerity of motion accompanies. Hence, the smallness, weakness, and quickness of the pulse: Hence the excitement is diminished every where, and in preference to other equal parts, in the whole san∣gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erous system, and that in exact proportion to the pe∣nury.</P>
<P>χ. <HI>From this state of the vessels</HI> arises the discharge of blood from the lungs, from the uterus, from the anus, or around the anus, from the urinary passages, and through the perspiratory pores. Hence arise disturbances of the stomach, want of appetite, loathing of food, and, there∣fore, upon account of want of norishment, and the lan∣guor of the digestive organs, always less and less blood arises in the system. So great a penury of blood is the principal origin of bleeding diseases; which never happen but in the asthenic state. The same <HI>penury of blood</HI> acts in such a manner, and chiefly affects its own vessels, because, according to a law so often mentioned, its debilitating energy chiefly falls upon them. In sthenic diseases, that have advanced to their height, or a little beyond it, a few drops of blood from the nose, or a dropping of blood from the same, or any other part, demonstrate only a predis∣position to indirect debility, but not an establishment of

it, and that the matter still remains within the operation of excessive stimulus<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">who ever heard of a flood of blood coming from the lungs in a pe∣ripneumony? Or, who has not heard of it in consumptive cases; which are the diseases depending upon the laxity of vessels of which we are speaking.

What had been the state of these women before the disease? Did they eat and digest so completely, as that there was any reason for supposing their vessels were filled with blood? No; long before the arrival of the disease their eating was puny, and considering the kind of matter they made use of, to wit, vegetable, it was not to be supposed more beneficial from its quality than its quan∣tity. What was the idea to be gathered from their symptoms, and par∣ticularly the pulse? The pulse had all the marks of an asthenic one; be∣ing weak, small, and quick, like that of a new-born infant. What was the state of their habit? Was it vigorous and robust? It was the re∣verse; soft, delicate; the habit lax; a falling off in flesh, with weak∣ness over the whole system, and total loss of appetite. What were the remedies employed to remove this supposed offspring of plethora? Bleed∣ings, repeated without end; other evacuations with the same freedom, and vegetable food in a fluid form, and a horizontal posture, with their head lower than their body and under-extremities. Miserable are the resources of ignorance, and contemptible their execution! Fill a rigid tube full of water, open at both ends, and the fluid, no doubt, will run out at the end which is most below an exact horizontal position. But that is not the case with the fluids in living vessels. The excitement, distinguishing them from all rigid inanimate tubes, counteracts the ef∣fect of gravity, while its living state remains: In proportion to the de∣gree of which, the sides of the vessel will embrace their column of flu∣ids, and prevent the flowing out of the fluids, in proportion to the de∣gree of excitement; and before the gravity can act, the excitement must be extinguished, and the living system reduced to a lumpish mass of dead matter. It is the latter, that enables them to produce that effect. And, therefore, bleeding discharges can never happen, either in health or sthenic diathesis, unless in that very high degree of it that approach∣es to indirect debility, and even then, only in the forced, scanty, man∣ner described in the text; whereas, after the establishment of indirect debility, or in the case of direct, the great discharges only can happen, and that without force, in great plenty, but still short of what would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if no excitement restrained it.</NOTE>.</P>

ψ. Thus it is not an excess in the quantity of blood, but laxity and atony from its defiency, that upholds the affair of bleeding discharges; which proceed <HI>in their course,</HI> not with <HI>any</HI> effort<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">or active impulse,</NOTE>, but a diminution of tone: They are all asthenic, and the asthenic diathesis, as far as it de∣pends upon them, consists in direct debility.</P>
<P>ω. But, as every other exciting hurtful power may be converted into indirect debility, so, also may an over∣proportion of blood. For the vessels, ultimately distended, and beyond all bounds, may<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">under the high sthenic diathesis,</NOTE>, by the excess of <HI>that</HI> sti∣mulus, exhaust their own excitability, and, thereby, put an end to their excitement.

The reason of the slowness of my assent to it was, that, upon every other occasion of any accumulation of matter in the first pas∣sages, even in the colic itself, I had always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the pactice of invigo∣rating the peristaltic motion, by stimulants, sufficient to clear away all such extraneous matter; while vomiting and purging, by their relaxing effect upon the vessels, served to generate more, and increase the cause of the disease, which is always debility.

in thinking, by wasting the excitability, ends in indirect debility; or that deficient, weak, vacant state of mind, uncapable of keeping up a train, which produces the same hurtful effect by direct debility. This faulty state of the mind contributes greatly to weaken <HI>the system</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">It may often be remarked by physicians, that their patients, after every other proper part of cure has been executed, are never completely restored to their healthy state, till they are again engaged in their usual occupations both of mind and body.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CXL. Violent passions of mind, as great anger, keen grief, unbridled joy, going to such a pitch as to destroy excitability, have the same effect as excessive thinking, and admit of all the same reasoning.</P>
<P>CXLI. A force of passion rising to the height of ex∣hausting the excitability, induces that asthenic diathesis, which is occasioned by indirect debility, and diseases of that stamp. Hence epilepsy<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">or the falling sickness,</NOTE>, hence apoplexy, and that when, the mind has been screwed up to the height of pas∣sion, often fatal.</P>
<P>CXLII. On the contrary, when there is a deficiency of passion, as in melancholy, grief, fear, terror, despair, which are only lower degrees of joy, assurance, and hope, and imply no more than a diminution of exciting passions, not emotions <HI>of a nature</HI> opposite to those, and positive; their tendency is to produce the asthenic diathesis, which depends upon direct debility. The immediate production of this is loss of appetite, loathing of food, sickness at sto∣mach, vomiting, pain of the stomach<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">called cardialgia by systematics</NOTE>, loose belly with∣out pain, the same with pain, indigestion<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">called dyspepsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</NOTE>, cholic, the the gout, and fevers.</P>
<P>CXLIII. The <HI>exercise of</HI> the senses, when it is agreea∣ble, has a very great effect in exciting the whole body, and
<PB N="76" REF="022373_0090_0FB86DC7C7488850"/>
in producing emotions, which, together with the hurtful powers mentioned above, may easily contribute to the pro∣duction of sthenic diathesis. Those emotions are exem∣plified in drinking, dancing, in agreeable entertainments where the eye is dazzled with the splendour of the dishes, of the company, and of all the objects around.</P>
<P>CXLIV. The energy of the same <HI>exercise of the senses,</HI> when it is excessive, and carries the effects, just now men∣tioned, too far, produces indirect debility. On the con∣trary, when the senses are either in part destroyed, or in part dulled, or disagreeably affected<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Nothing is more clearly disagreeable than an obscure light, as when one reads with a small or un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ussed candle. Hence the luxury of more candles than one, or of wax or spermaceti candles. This is often experienced at Ranelagh, and may be seen in children exquisitely amused.</NOTE>, the mind is de∣jected, and the whole body thrown into <HI>a state</HI> of languor and direct debility. And, in both cases, especially when there is a concurrence of other debilitating hurtful powers the asthenic diathesis arises.</P>
<P>CXLV. The effect of the air<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">upon the human body,</NOTE>, independent of its qualities, as they are called, or its properties, and its use in supporting respiration, is less obvious to observation<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">than the other powers that have been spoken of,</NOTE>; at the same time it cannot be doubted, that its application to the whole surface of the body is a stimulus not to be dispensed with. The air is seldom applied in a pure state: it is commonly blended with foreign matters that diminish its force of stimulus; and, while its salutary stimulus depends upon its purity, at the same time it is uncertain whether e∣ver its purity goes so far as to stimulate in excess, and there∣by produce sthenic diathesis. The baloons, lately invented, by which men get above the clouds, would serve excellently to throw light upon that matter, if it were not for the cold <HI>that</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="022373_0091_0FB86DD0A2C8DC88"/>
accompanies this progress. Be that as it may; since we never live in the purest air, and yet live commodiously e∣nough, it is, therefore, credible, that too pure an air has a ten∣dency to stimulate in excess, and, therefore, produce sthe∣nic diathesis.</P>
<P>CXLVI. But, as nothing is more usual than impurity of air, and every impurity diminishes its stimulus, a very impure air, or air blended with impure matters, without doubt debilitates, and produces asthenic diathesis. Ac∣cordingly, impure air is a frequent cause of typhus, as is evident from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate of those who died in the black hole of Calcutta. Whether ever the air, from an excess of pu∣rity, produces asthenic diathesis, is the more doubtful, that, as has been said, it is as yet undecided whether it produces sthenic diathesis or now.</P>
<P>Ε. Contagious matter, in so far as it may have any ten∣dency to produce general diseases, <HI>in</HI> one form produces sthenic, in another asthenic diseases, and, therefore, acts like the ordinary hurtful powers of either sort, and admits of all the same reasoning. But, in so far as it only occa∣sions the eruption, without making any change in the ex∣citement, it is to be referred to the local diseases.</P>
<P>Ζ. To poisons, if they act as general stimulants, all the reasoning that has been employed with respect to the other hurtful powers, will apply. It is not, however, likely that they are general stimulants.</P>
<P>CXLVII. It is seldom from the separate, almost al∣ways from the united operation of all the powers, that both the diathesis, whether as remaining <HI>within the range</HI> of predisposition, or rising to the degree of actual morbid state are produced, and from no inherent power in the system.</P>

<HEAD>The Cause of each Diathesis.</HEAD>
<P>CXLVIII. The cause of sthenic diathesis, produce in the way that has now been explained, is, in conse∣quence of the operation of the powers that have been mentioned, too great an excitement of the living system every where, <HI>with the effect of</HI> first encreasing all the functions, then of producing a disturbance in some, and impairing others, but never by a debilitating operation.</P>
<P>CXLIX. The cause of the asthenic diathesis arising from the same source, is, in consequence of the debilita∣ting hurtful powers, too little excitement of the living sys∣tem every where, <HI>with the effect of</HI> impairing all the functi∣ons, disturbing some, giving a false appearance of en∣creasing others, but always debilitating<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">It must now appear to the reader, to what simplicity the hitherto conjectural, incoherent, erroneous, mysterious, and enigmatical art of physic, is now reduced. It has been demonstrated, that there are only two forms of diseases, that the deviation from the state of health, in which the morbid state consists, is not either repletion or inanition, or changes in the qualities of the fluids, whether of an acid or alkaline nature, or the introduction of foreign matters into the system, or a change of figure of the extreme particles, or a disproportion in the dis∣tribution of the blood, or an encrease or decrease of the power of the heart and vessels as regulating the circulation, or a rational principle governing the actions of the body, or an alternation in the extreme par∣ticles as being of too large or too small a size, or an alteration of the pores, as being too narrow or too capacious, or a constriction of the superficial vessels from cold, or a spasm of them producing a reaction, as it is called, of the heart and interior vessels, or any thing that any person has yet thought of respecting the cause and nature of morbid state. On the contrary, it has been proved that health and disease are the same state depending upon the same cause, that is, excitement, varying only in degree; and that the powers producing both are the same, some∣times acting with proper degree of force, at other times either with too much or too little; that the whole and sole province of a physician, is not to look for morbid states and remedies which have no existence, but to consider the deviation of excitement from the healthy standard, in order to remove it by the proper means. The reasoning part of this doc∣trine, it is expected, the reader will find irreprehensible and unanswer∣able; and the practical part, from the astonishing cures that have upon innumerable occasions been effected, will ever stand in support of the truth and utility, as well as simplicity of the whole.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>CLI. PREVIOUS to the disturbance<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">of the functions, which, it has just now been said, the hurtful ef∣fects of both sets of powers produce,</NOTE> which never happens till after the arrival of the disease<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">During the predisposition to peripneumony, as well as to every other disease, neither the symptoms of disturbance, nor any other symp∣toms at all appear. And in mild cases, such as catarrh, the symptoms of disturbance occur not through the whole course of the disease: But, when a disease is, like the peripneumony or the gout, of a violent na∣ture, then the system is commonly disturbed, and in a most conspicuous degree. The affection of the lungs in the former, from the inflamma∣tion within, and of one of the feet, or some other part in the latter, from an external inflammation, give extreme disturbance to the affected parts, while there is a disease of the same nature as the gout, that is dy∣spepsia, or indigestion, in which the inflammation never appears.</NOTE>, and even then only in a violent attack of it, all the senses are acute, the motions both voluntary and involuntary<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">The voluntary motions are those that are performed under the in∣fluence of the will, such as the motion of the limbs in walking, or in any sort of exercise.

<P>CLII. How far the intellectual faculty, and the force of passion, are encreased, will be learned from a comparison of them in this diathesis, in good health, in the second form of diseases and predisposition to it. In this way it is that the functions are first encreased.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Sthenic Diathesis illustrated by an explanation of its Symp∣toms.</HEAD>
<P>CLIII. The encrease of <HI>the force of</HI> the senses, of the motions, of the intellectual faculty, and of the passions, depends upon the encrease of excitement in every one of their organs, among other actions, quickening the moti∣on of the blood <HI>through them.</HI></P>
<P>CLIV. The coming on of every sthenic disease is announced by a shivering. It depends upon a diminished perspiration, by means of the diathesis being <HI>exquisitely</HI> strong in the extreme vessels of the skin. The same is the
<PB N="81" REF="022373_0095_0FB86DD678428AC8"/>
explanation to be given of the sense of cold, which com∣monly accompanies the shivering; and the same is the ex∣planation of the dryness of the skin.</P>
<P>CLV. In the same diseases, the pulse is stronger, har∣der, and fuller, and somewhat more frequent, than <HI>in its</HI> sound <HI>state.</HI> Its fulness and hardness is owing to the ta∣king animal food plentifully during the predisposition. The force and frequency is occasioned by the same and any other stimulus, as that of strong drink; that of the diffu∣sible kind, and that of exercise, whether corporeal or men∣tal: Nay all the stimulant hurtful powers are participant of the same effect.</P>
<P>CLVI. If, in the progress of the disease, the pulse sometimes becomes weaker, softer, and quicker, that is a bad sign, and occasioned either by the debilitating plan of cure being pushed beyond the proper bounds: or, in con∣sequence of a neglect of that sort of cure, it may be owing to some debility induced by the excess of excitement. The former <HI>of these</HI> is direct, the latter indirect debi∣lity; both to be avoided.</P>
<P>CLVII. The complexion in the vessels, which is of∣ten a consequence of a previous appearance of paleness, and great quantity of secreted fluids, is occasioned by an over∣proportion of blood, in consequence of an excessive sthenic diathesis obstructing the perspiration. The same is the cause of the head-ach and pains in different parts. For, as the head-ach so quickly and easily yields to bleeding, it is, therefore, seldom to be suspected of being owing to inflammation within the head. And <HI>the reason for so think∣ing is strengthened by this further circumstance,</HI> that the in∣flammation arising in general diseases always affects an ex∣ternal part, as far as that fact has been enquired into<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vide above, CXIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CLVIII. The delirium also, that sometimes arises in a violent state of disease, is not to be imputed to inflamma∣tion,
<PB N="82" REF="022373_0096_0FB86A5D6DF0C1E8"/>
and for the same reason; for it yields so much to bleeding and other evacuations, that there is no reason for suspecting inflammation within the head. That abun∣dance of blood in the vessels, distending these to excess, is the cause of the whole affair, is proved on the one hand by the redness of the face, implying such abundance, and on the other by bleeding, removing the disease at once.</P>
<P>CLIX. Thirst and heat, which are also remarkable symptoms in sthenic diseases, depend upon the sthenic dia∣thesis in the extreme vessels of the fauces and skin; <HI>the dia∣thesis</HI> so obstructing the vessels as not to allow a return of perspiration, but to suffer, however, the blood to pass in∣to the very neighbourhood of the ends of the vessels, and, by means of the suppression of the perspiration, to accumu∣late, under the cuticle, the heat generated in the system. Thus, in the throat, from an affection of the ends of the vessels, the saliva and other fluids, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low of which the throat is lubricated, and freed from that sense of dryness, which is called thirst, are now confined<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">and prevented to flow out,</NOTE>, and thereby produce thirst.</P>
<P>CLX. Hoarseness, cough, and expectoration, which are sometimes observed in sthenic diseases, commonly pro∣ceed, and succeed to each other in the following order. There is first often a hoarseness, then a dry cough, then a cough with expectoration. The cause of the hoarse∣ness and dry cough is an obstruction of the exhalents and mucous vessels, which terminate in the bronchia, still occasioned by a violent sthenic diathesis, and prevented from transmitting their contents to lubicrate the air-vessels<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">The bronchia are the divisions of the wind-pipe running through the substance of the lungs, and blended with the blood-vessels. In the substance of the lungs, besides these two sets of vessels, the air-vessels and blood-vessels, there are likewise exhalants, small arteries, and mu∣cous glands, coming off from the extremities of the red arteries. The wind-pipe is covered with the latter; and the great quantity of mucus thrown up from the lungs, often in perfect health, and in innumerable cases, both of sthenic and asthenic general disease, sufficiently proves the existence of the source from which they flow.</NOTE>, so as that hoarseness may be removed, and the ex∣pectoration
<PB N="83" REF="022373_0097_0FB86A61C4D59838"/>
proceed with freedom. Again, the expectora∣tion is <HI>next</HI> freely made, because the diathesis, being now diminished, and allowing the ends of the vessels to be re∣laxed, and the fluids to be poured out in abundance upon the air-vessels, is the occasion of the fluids producing a commotion of the excitability over this whole organ, and by the convulsive motion, which is called cough, of being themselves thrown out.</P>
<P>CLXI. As the greater freedom of expectoration now implies an abatement of the diathesis; so too great a flow and too long a continuance of it shows, that the diathesis is now rushing in the asthenic <HI>state,</HI> either from indirect debility, as when the disease, in its progress, has much ex∣hausted the excitability, or from direct debility as when the plan of cure, proper <HI>in kind,</HI> has been pushed beyond the bounds.</P>
<P>CLXII. Those same symptoms<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">mentioned just now,</NOTE>, while they stop short of the range of direct debility, or are not yet chan∣ged into the indirect, are occasioned by heat, and what∣ever stimulates in excess, and removed by cold and what∣ever acts as a weakening power.</P>
<P>CLXIII. Paleness, shriveling of the skin, clearness of the urine, and bound belly, which chiefly happen about the beginning of the disease, arise from a degree of the di∣athesis, shutting up the ends of the vessels in such a man∣ner, that either nothing is excreted, or the thiner part, as in the urine, only escapes. The cure of the affection of the urine, of the obstructed perspiration and costiveness,
<PB N="84" REF="022373_0098_0FB86A6484ED8538"/>
shows that the diathesis is now gradually abating, the dis∣ease becoming mild, and now upon the eve of being tho∣roughly removed by emetics, purgatives, and sudorifics, and the use of other debilitating remedies.</P>
<P>CLXIV. In sthenic diseases, when they are gentle, the appetite is often not much diminished, and oftener more food can be taken than is serviceable. But, unless the lightest vegetable matter only, and that in the form of watery potion, or in a fluid form, be given, every mor∣sel of it will do harm.</P>
<P>CLXV. But, when either from indulgence in food of a rich nature, or from employing a stimulant plan of cure, or from the disease having, from the beginning, arisen from very violent, hurtful powers, and now attained its highest degree of violence; in any, or all these circum∣stances, both the other bad symptoms, mentioned above, break out directly, and the violent disorders of the sto∣mach, or an accute pain of the thorax, show themselves indirectly.</P>
<P>CLXVI. In a violent diathesis, therefore, where there is little appetite for food, but a very great desire for drink; with the latter the patient is by all means to be gratified; but the former should be avoided, as producing loathing, sickness at stomach, and vomiting, Those symptoms are not usually of long duration, unless when the diathesis is now going, or actually gone, into the asthenic state by the means that have been mentioned above<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Vide last paragraph and a few immediately preceding it.</NOTE>, and, by re∣moving the other symptoms by the proper debilitating plan of cure, they go off; but when the stomach sickness and vomiting are urgent, and begin now to be a little more obstinate, and of a little more duration, one may know that they still remain short of the change into indi∣rect debility, <HI>by the following marks:</HI> if the pulse still main∣tains
<PB N="85" REF="022373_0099_0FB86A6611A08708"/>
moderation in its frequency, and does not much a∣bate of its fullness and force; if artificial vomiting and purging diminish the morbid vomiting, and, in one word, if the debilitating plan of cure still succeeds. But, it will then at last be understood that the disease is altogether changed, and its cause converted into the opposite, when those symptoms every day encrease; when the pulse becomes weaker and weaker; when gripes in the intestines, and liquid stools, are superadded to the symptoms that dis∣turb the stomach, and when the antisthenic or debilita∣ting plan of cure is now of evident detriment<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See above, CIX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CLXVII. While the same symptoms<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">of the stomach and intestines,</NOTE> <HI>still</HI> stop short of indirect debility, the excessive excitement in the stomach being of quicker tendency to indirect debility there than any where else, upon account of the stomach's great sensi∣bility, and the force of the more powerful stimuli being chiefly exerted upon it, produces symptoms of disturbance<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See above, LIV.</NOTE>; for the most powerful stimuli, and those that are signally powerful in producing sthenic diathesis<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">as high seasoned animal food, wine, spirituous drink, cordials, and the whole train of high diffusible stimuli, some of these, as meat and wine, have no effect upon the external surface, or any other part: others, as some of the condiments, such as mustard and strong spirits, and above all the diffusible stimulants, as aether, camphor, and opium in a liquid form, do act upon the second, and by their application to it support their own internal use. Thus, to prevent or remove the gout, anasarca, sprains, and so forth, the application of any of those high diffusible re∣medies, just now mentioned, will greatly contribute, along with their use as taken into the stomach, to support the general operation. These, and innumerable others, are so many facts that have been suggested by observations and trials made in the prosecution of this doctrine.</NOTE> are first applied there, and exert a greater force upon the excitabi∣lity in that than <HI>any other part.</HI> Those <HI>stimuli</HI> are the se∣veral preparations of animal food, the several concentra∣ted

strong drinks, the several condiments with which they are seasoned, the various diffusible stimuli, as the different preparations of opium, volatile alkali, camphor, musk, and aether; and they all act upon the stomach with that force which they exert not upon any other part; they do not upon the intestines <HI>below,</HI> because they undergo a change from the first digestion before they pass over into the first portion of the intestinal canal; not upon the lacteal vessels, because they are not received into them till they are fur∣ther diluted, and undergo another change from the diges∣tive operation, and when so changed, they are next car∣ried to be mixed with the blood; not upon the heart and arteries, upon account of the same dilution <HI>meeting them also in those vessels,</HI> and of a constant change of mixture oc∣curring through the whole course of the circulation; not upon the terminations of the arteries, <HI>whether</HI> exhalant or glandular, <HI>and whether</HI> these excrete from the body a matter already corrupted, or carry back by the lym∣phatic vessels, an useful matter to the blood: and that both for the reasons that have been given, and particularly be∣cause some great change is made in the exhalants and glands; not upon the lymphatic vessels, where a new fluid is constantly flowing in upon the old in these parts by means of anastomosing branches, and chiefly in the tho∣racic duct; not upon the other blood-vessels, upon ac∣count of the great change that a repetition of the circula∣tion produces; not upon the muscular fibres, whether voluntary or involuntary, because the stimuli by no means come in contact with these; not upon the brain or me∣dullary substance for the same reason<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">to wit, that they do not come into contact with them,</NOTE>, as well as for the great distance of these parts from the part that re∣ceived the first contact of the stimuli. In one word, as all the exciting powers, whether salutary or hurtful, or
<PB N="87" REF="022373_0101_0FB86A69203C3668"/>
curative, act somewhat more powerfully upon certain parts than upon others, as these parts are generally those which they first affect, and with which they come into direct con∣tact; those, therefore, in preference to others, are most liable to pass either from sthenic diathesis into asthenic, or from the latter to the former: <HI>which, however, happens</HI> in such a manner, that, because the excitability is one <HI>uniform,</HI> undivided property over the whole body; whether the excitement has been encreased in a peculiar part, or dimi∣nished; and, whether its diminution has been owing to direct or indirect debility, and <HI>in either way</HI> the asthenic diathesis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; all the rest of the body soon follows the kind of change <HI>that has taken place;</HI> and, since the pow∣ers that have acted have been, and are the same, that is, either excessively<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">in so far as they produced sthenic diathesis,</NOTE> or insufficiently stimulant<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">that is, debilitating, in so far as they produce the asthenic diathesis, that depends on direct debility, or in so far as they produce the asthenic diathesis that depends upon indirect debility,</NOTE>, or so to an ul∣timate excess; and as the excitability upon which they have acted, and still act, is the same, that is, the whole consideration of the cause is the same, the effect must al∣so be the same, that is, the same sort of actions, whether in excess or de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">whether sthenic or asthenic,</NOTE>, must be established over the whole body.</P>
<P>CLXVIII. The inflammation, which accompanies the phlegmasiae<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">diseases that are sthenic and accompanied with an inflammation of a part, as a portion of the lungs, the throat, some of the joints, and in which, as has been formerly said, the inflammation is like any other symptom, an effect of the cause of the disease, not itself the cause,</NOTE>, occupies an external part, as far as its nature has been yet ascertained. And the reason of that is, that heat, which is the most powerful hurtful agent in those diseases, either alone, or alternating with cold, or
<PB N="88" REF="022373_0102_0FB86A6A927E0628"/>
succeeding to it, has much more power externally, where it is directly applied, than internally, where the tempera∣ture is nearly stationary, in stimulating, and, therefore, raising the general diathesis, to the degree of actual in∣flammation in a part. Hence the throat, hence the dif∣ferent joints, hence the face, where the form of inflamma∣tion is different<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">as when the inflammation of erysipelas appears there;</NOTE>, hence the lungs, which are to be con∣sidered as an external part, because the air has direct ac∣cess to them, <HI>all these</HI> are affected with inflammation in preference to other parts. And, besides the energy of the exciting hurtful power, just now mentioned, there is in the part, that is to undergo the inflammation, a grea∣ter sensibility<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">See above, LIII. λ.</NOTE> than in others, or a more accumulated exci∣tability; by means of which it happens, that, of the parts that have been mentioned, <HI>sometimes</HI> one, <HI>sometimes</HI> another is affected, more than the rest<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">In the inflammatory sore-throat the inflammation affects the throat, which is also sometimes the seat of an erysipelatus inflammation. In erysipelas, sometimes the face, sometimes one of the legs, sometimes the ear, sometimes the temples are inflamed. I have frequently been affected with an erysipelas, that begins with an acute inflammation and pain in one ear, which is thickened to four times its usual dimension; from that it spreads over the whole hairy-scalp till it reaches the neigh∣bourhood of the ear in the opposite side, never, however, affecting that ear; this progress has been sometimes from the right to the left, sometimes from the latter to the former, in proportion as either had been more exposed than the other to heat, or the alternation of heat with cold, or their succession to each other. This disease is sthenic, but in a mild degree, and to be removed by coolness, cold water, low vege∣table fluid diet, and a slight purge. It was once greatly aggravated by wine, spirituous drink, and the high diffusible stimuli. In rheumatism, the inflammation attacks a large joint, sometimes shifting from one to another, sometimes several at a time, and, in contradistinction to cry-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pelatus, is deep seated, extending to the interior part of the true skin, which is the case with every such inflammation, called therefore, phlegm∣onic; while its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat in erysipelatus is betwixt the scarf-skin and outer part of the true skin upon the corpus mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osum. To these phlegmasiae, accompanied with an inflammation of a part, depending upon the gene∣ral cause of the disease, and especially upon the effect of temperature, may be added that which an inflammation in one of the ears accompanies, though this case is seldom admitted into the number of the phlegmasiae. It is, indeed, sometimes local, arising from local injuries, but is as cer∣tainly at others, a general disease, and to all intents and purposes a phlegmasia.</NOTE>. To this <HI>consideration
<PB N="89" REF="022373_0103_0FB86A70AE430C50"/>
of the</HI> cause, it is to be added, that which ever of the parts we have mentioned has been injured, in whatever manner it may have undergone the inflammation peculiar to the phlegmasiae, that part, in every after attack of a new phlegmasia, is in more danger of being inflamed than the rest. This is the true cause of the recurrence of some of the phlegmasiae, as the inflammatory sore throat, and rheu∣matism<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Those two diseases, in young vigorous persons, are very liable to be exceedingly troublesome by the frequency of their occurrence. In the younger part of my life the violence in degree, and frequency of recur∣rence, of the sthenic inflammatory sore throat, was very distressing, as the least variation of the external temperature, superadded to a full nourishing diet, not without the stimulus of a chearful glass, was ready to renew, not only the inflammation, but the whole phaenomena of the disease. The same thing I have often observed in the frequent recur∣rence of rheumatism in persons of the same age and habit, perhaps, with some difference of temperament. But it is to be observed, that, in pro∣portion to the advance of life, and diminution of vigour, both these diseases become much less frequent, and much less violent. Nor is any thing more common than their giving way at this time to a very op∣posite disease, the gout, which depends upon a superaddition of direct debility to the indirect, that laid the foundation of it. I am pretty cer∣tain my inflammatory fore throat, or erysipelas, never happened spon∣taneously, nor without an addition of stimulant power, to those that produce that disease, in consequence of carrying to some excess the plan of cure suited to the removal or prevention of the gout.</NOTE>. Peripneumony is a disease less frequent than any of the rest of this form, because "the seat of its in∣flammation"
<PB N="90" REF="022373_0104_0FB86A73E0047CC8"/>
is exempted from many stimuli, liable to produce sthenic diathesis with its accompanying inflamma∣tion</P>
<P>Η. As the inflammatory fever, catarrh, the gentle small∣pox, are unattended by inflammation (unless that in the last a local inflammation from a local cause, quite different from that which makes our present subject, takes place), and as the inflammation in peripneumony, violent erysi∣pelas, and similar other cases of great violence, is found the highest in degree; for that reason the conclusion is, that the degree of inflammation, which is a symptom of gene∣ral sthenic diseases, is proportioned to the degree of the sthenic diathesis<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">It shall by and by be shewed, that this sort of inflammation is on∣ly a part of the general diathesis, somewhat higher in degree than any other part, but far short of the degree constituted by the whole general affection.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CLXIX. The inflammation, in this case, is nothing else, but a state of the inflamed part of a common nature with <HI>that in</HI> the rest of the body. And as the inflammation is produced by a greater degree of excitement in the in∣flamed, than in any other equal part; so, before the dis∣ease comes on, of which the inflammation is only a part or symptom, the excitement of that part is understood to be proportionally greater than in any other part<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. L. and LI. Suppose the excitement in every part of the system to be 45 at some point in the period of the predisposition, and 54 in the part to be inflamed; after the coming on of the disease the same proportion will hold; when the excitement has now mounted up to 60, the excitement of a part will be understood to have gone to 69; keeping up still the same proportion. But this 9 degrees of grea∣ter excitement in a part, comes far short of the sum total of excitement in all the parts affected with the general sthenic diathesis; that you may suppose 3000: and then the conclusion will be, that the general sthenic diathesis consists in a sum total of morbid affection, as 3000; while the inflammation of the part is only an affection of 3 degrees of ex∣citement.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="022373_0105_0FB86A75A84ABA50"/>
CLXX. This inflammation, which for the sake of di∣stinction is to be called general sthenic inflammation, should be distinguished from another, which is a local af∣fection, arising from local hurtful powers, and depending upon a fault in the organ, or a solution of continuity<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Solution of continuity in all its forms, whether as being the ef∣fect of puncturing, cutting, bruising, compression, erosion from acrid matter, or from heat, or cold, is always followed by an inflammation, which, when it goes on briskly, and needs to have its violence restrain∣ed, should be called as is expressed in the next paragraph.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CLXXI. To this the term of sthenic local inflammation applies. The general always depends upon sthenic diathe∣sis, is a symptom or part of it, never precedes it, always suc∣ceeds to it sooner or later, arises from the same hurtful powers<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">which produce the other symptoms,</NOTE>, and is reduced by the same remedies. In con∣tradistinction to which, the local affection, as it arises from local injury, producing a solution of continuity or deran∣ging the texture of the part; so, if the labouring part is not very sensible, the affection extends no further. In the case of a part being endued with a high degree of sensibility, suppose the stomach, the intestines, among the internal parts; among the external, the tender substance under the nails; <HI>in these cases,</HI> the effect of the inflammation is propagated over the whole system, and in consequence of an affection of all the vessels, excites a tumult every where. The same local sthenic inflammation, whether it be fixed in the part, or from its propagation, gives more general disturbance, yields to no remedies, but those that act upon the affected part first, and heal the solution of continuity<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">or reparation of united substance,</NOTE>. Let it suffice to have said so much at present upon these inflammations, for the sake of <HI>establishing necessary</HI> distinctions as more is afterwards to be said upon the local, in its pro∣per place. There are as many inflammations still remain∣ing,
<PB N="92" REF="022373_0106_0FB86A7681012808"/>
universal and local, to be more fully explained in that part of our work where the proper order requires it.</P>
<P>CLXXII. Inflammation, also, as often as it affects a vi∣tal part, produces symptoms of disturbance. Whether ever the general sthenic inflammation affects the brain and its membranes, is hitherto not ascertained<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Phrenitis has been thought, and commonly even defined, an in∣flammation of the brain; an opinion that, however universal, seems to be liable to much doubt: nay, there are many reasons for adopting an apposite one, as will appear from the reasoning in this paragraph of the text.</NOTE>. And it is more probable, that the commotion of the head, and other disturbing symptoms of phrenitis, do not depend upon inflammation, as the following phaenomena seem to show: <HI>The</HI> first <HI>of those is,</HI> the case by which the cure is affected, the whole tumult of <HI>symptoms</HI> readily yield∣ing to bleeding, purging, and other asthenic<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">what are commonly called antiphlogistic, we call debilitating.</NOTE> remedies; and, it not being very credible, that the effect of actual inflammation in a part so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and so necessary to life, could be so easily effaced. Then <HI>another argument against the same opinion is, that</HI> there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s no certain proof, after re∣covery, of the existence of inflammation <HI>during the disease.</HI> Next, analogy makes for the same conclusion <HI>which we are disposed to draw;</HI> for, as it has been said above, general inflammation does not arise internally in any general sthenic diseases<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CXIII.</NOTE>; on the contrary, as often as it occurs, it is always in an external part<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">It was long an opinion, that the inflammation in rheumatism might be transferred to an internal part, as the stomach; but that, also, is now laid aside, and all the cases where there could be the least appear∣ance of any such transference, have been found to be cases of the gout, or some analagous disease of debility.</NOTE>. Hay, all the symptoms are such as arise from the general sthenic hurt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> powers,
<PB N="93" REF="022373_0107_0FB86A784FFAC648"/>
and that, also, yield to the general antisthenic remedies, and in proportion to their degree.</P>
<P>CLXXIII. The same<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">that we have assigned as the case of phrenitic affection also</NOTE> is the cause of head-ach, redness of the eye, as well as of delirium.</P>
<P>CLXXIV. There is, however, no reason to doubt, but that inflammation is the cause of that disturbance, which happens to the lungs <HI>in peripneumony.</HI> To the part where the pain is <HI>felt</HI> externally, whatever part of the thorax it is, an actual inflammation is opposed internally. And, as the inflammation is proportioned to the degree of general sthenic diathesis, and never happens but in a high degree of that diathesis; so that the pain is proportioned to the degree of inflammation<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">The inflammation was supposed a chief and primary circumstance, and its cause and seat, the cause and seat of the whole disease; while the general sthenic diathesis, and all the symptoms depending on it, was supposed the offspring of the inflammation. But the truth is, in every respect, the reverse of this account. The general sthenic diathesis is the effect of the general exciting hurtful powers. As the effect of these, in a lesser degree, it exists during the predisposition, and before the ar∣rival of the disease; and, after the disease is come on, it subsists, as cer∣tainly as such, for, one, two, or three days, as afterwards, when the sign of the inflammation, the pain, makes its appearance. It is only an in∣crease of it, that induces the latter: and it is not to be cured by any con∣trivance of throwing any thing into the inflamed part, there being no such thing to be found in nature, but by the several means of removing the common cause, that is, evacuant and other debilitating remedies. Those, while, at the same time, they remove the other symptoms, by also removing the disease, prove that the common cause of the whole is the general diathesis. The inflammation, therefore, like every other the cause of the general disorder, is a consequence, instead of being symptom.</NOTE>; and the state of the pulse must be estima∣ted by paying a due regard to its cause. In <HI>the case of</HI> an high diathesis, and high degree of inflammation, its effect, the pain, seated in some part of the thorax, sometimes a∣bout
<PB N="94" REF="022373_0108_0FB86A7DDE29E0C8"/>
the sternum, sometimes nigh the nipples, some∣times farther back on either side, sometimes in the back between or above the shoulders, is acute and pun∣gent, and the pulse very hard and strong. When the di∣athesis, and the part of it <HI>we call</HI> inflammation, is less, the pain is less acute, more dull, and easier to be borne; the pulse is<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">not soft and yielding, according to the common notion, but</NOTE> <HI>still</HI> hard and strong, though less so than in the other case. Afterwards, in the progress of the disease, the pain abases, becomes dull, the respiration which had been much disturbed by it, becomes more easy and free. The pulse now, which formerly was only less hard becomes truly <HI>positively</HI> soft, and that in proportion to the degree of indirect debility, occasioned by a neglect of the proper plan of cure; or in proportion to the production of direct debility from the antisthenic or debilitating plan of cure having been pushed too far. But the hardness of the pulse, and increase of pain, is never to be imputed to the inflammation being seated in the membrane; nor is the softness of the former, and dullness of the latter, to <HI>be attributed</HI> to its occupying the soft parenchymatous sub∣stance<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Such, however, and many other distinctions, equally false, fri∣volous, and misleading in the practice, have been at all times universal∣ly received by systematic, and lately by nosological writers.</NOTE>, it being impossible that an inflammation, if it oc∣cupied either of those parts, should not affect the next points of the vessels in the other. The cause, therefore, of those symptoms that has here been assigned, must be ad∣mitted.</P>
<P>CLXXV. The pustles, which accompany certain ste∣henic diseases, arise from a contagion, taken into the body, diffused over the whole, and, in passing out of it, detain∣ed along with the perspirable fluid, under the scarf-skin. The cause of the distention, and, therefore, of the great number of pustles, is the sthenic diathesis, taking place
<PB N="95" REF="022373_0109_0FB86A80484CFC18"/>
in a high degree over the whole body, but in a <HI>still</HI> higher in the vessels of the skin, for the reasons formerly<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CXIII. and CXIV.</NOTE> as∣signed. In which operation the muscular fibres of the vessel, becauses they are as much encreased in density, in so far as they are considered as simple solids, as they receive an encrease of tone, in so far as they are considered as living<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See Chap. V.</NOTE>, are, on that account, so shortened, as not sufficiently to transmit the <HI>imperceptible</HI> vapour of the perspirable fluid. All the sthenic hurtful powers have a tendency to produce this effect, but heat, in a degree within its stimulant range and short of indirect debility, more than any of them. The same is the cause of costiveness.</P>
<P>Θ Sthenic diseases are often followed by debility, some∣times direct, at other times indirect, as is exemplified in the change of peripneumony into hydrothorax, the expla∣nation of which is evident from what has formerly been said.</P>

<P>CLXXVI. Before the <HI>symptoms</HI> of disturbance <HI>appear,</HI> which only supervene upon a violent degree of morbid state, all the senses are dull; the motions, both voluntary and involuntary, are torpid; the acuteness of genius is im∣paired; the sensibility and passions become languid. <HI>The following functions are all in a state of languor,</HI> which is dis∣coverable by the annexed marks: The languor of the heart and arteries is discernible in the pulse; as is also that of the extreme vessels on the surface, which is evident from the paleness, the dryness of the skin, and the shrinking of tu∣mors,
<PB N="96" REF="022373_0110_0FB86A81C80B8E18"/>
and drying up of ulcers<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">These symptoms have lately been construed into so many marks amounting to a proof of the existence of spasm upon the extreme vessels; but we shall, by and by, find a much better explanation of them.</NOTE>, and the manifest ab∣sence of sthenic diathesis, to produce any resemblance to those symptoms. That the muscles are in a state of torpor is demonstrable by their weakened <HI>action;</HI> and that the in∣ternal secretions are deficient, <HI>is equally certain from</HI> the penury of semen and milk, and the redundance of fluids in a state of degeneracy. The languor of the digestive organs is manifested by want of appetite, loathing of food, some∣times thirst, sickness of stomach, vomiting, weakness of the system, and evident penury of blood.</P>
<P>CLXXVII. In the same diathesis, whether as not ha∣ving attained to the height of disease, and only remaining within <HI>the latitude of</HI> predisposition, or as raised to the mea∣sure of actual disease, the intellectual faculties and the passions are impaired. In this way are the functions im∣paired.</P>

<P>CLXXVIII. SHIVERING is not unusual at the commencement of asthenic diseases of any considerable se∣verity; and that, as often as its cause, a very deficient perspiration takes place. In this case the cause of the deficiency is, from the weakness of the whole system, that weakness of the heart and arteries, in consequence of which they propel their fluids every where with difficulty, <HI>and</HI> in their extremities with <HI>still</HI> more difficulty, or scarce at all. Hence the perspiration ceases. The same is the
<PB N="97" REF="022373_0111_0FB86A840040F100"/>
explanation to be given of the sense of cold, when it ac∣companies the shivering.</P>
<P>CLXXIX. In asthenic affections the pulse is weak, soft, small, and very quick. The softness, when it can be perceived for the smallness, as well as the smallness, is occasioned by an under-proportion of blood, arising, du∣ring the period of predisposition, from a scantiness of ani∣mal food, and an excess in the use of vegetable; or from a deficiency of aliment upon the whole, whether from the one or other source. The cause of the weakness and very great quickness of the pulse is the same deficiency of nourishment, as well as of all the stimuli, such as that of strong drink, that of mental or corporeal exercise, and an under-proportion of blood.</P>
<P>CLXXX. Since the excitability can only be gradually worn down<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. XXVI. XLIII.</NOTE> and the strength, thereby, repared; if, at any time, therefore, the pulse becomes full and hard too soon, and without a proportional relief of the symptoms, that is a bad sign, and happens because the stimulant plan of cure<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">otherwise the proper one,</NOTE> has been pushed beyond the proper rule<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. XLIX.</NOTE>; and it is <HI>a case of</HI> indirect debility superadded to the direct<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CLVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CLXXXI. The same is the cause of the paleness and dryness of the skin, as that of a check<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed perspiration; that is, the weakness of the heart and arteries. Hence the blood is not sufficiently propelled to the surface of the body.</P>
<P>CLXXXII. Head-ach, which is a most frequent symp∣tom of asthenic affections, and pains in the joints, which are more rare, are occasioned by a scantiness of blood: for such is the effect of the blood in distending the vessels, that a moderate distention, such as takes place in health, excites an agreeable sensation; and every thing, either a∣bove
<PB N="98" REF="022373_0112_0FB86A862A8665F8"/>
or below that <HI>standard, occasions</HI> an ungrateful one, and, therefore,<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">when it rises to a certain degree,</NOTE>, pain. But, we are much less in this case, than in that of sthenic pain<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CLVII.</NOTE>, to suspect inflam∣mation for the cause of the pain; because, not only the pain here, but even delirium, yields so easily to the stimu∣lant method of cure; which would not readily happen, if so delicate and sensible an organ, and <HI>one</HI> so necessary to life, laboured under an affection so liable to destroy the texture of the affected part.</P>
<P>CLXXXIII. Neither in general, is delirium, and for the same reason,<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">that has been just now mentioned,</NOTE> to be imputed to inflammation. It is, on the contrary, to be attributed to a scantiness of blood, and a deficiency of other stimuli. Nor is that by any means to be doubted; since stimulant remedies, which have no effect in filling the vessels, successfully and quick∣ly cure every delirium depending on debility<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">This is a fact as new, and of as much importance as any in this whole work. Physicians, hitherto, had no distinct notion of a variety of inflammations; and had scarce any idea of any inflammation, but such a one as was to be treated with bleeding and evacuation; nay, of∣ten, when they had no reason to suspect inflammation at all, the mere circumstance of pain was, in their estimation of it, sufficient to warrant a profusion of bleeding without end. But, the truth is, that pain may not not only arise from an inflammation, which they had no idea of, and which was to be cured by stimulants, but it arises from spasms, con∣vulsions, and even from emptiness.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And, when, in consequence of the removal of the disease, and of the re-production and establishment of the healthy state, enough of nourishment is taken in and di∣gested, then <HI>it is that,</HI> at last, the mental function receives a complete and solid re-establishment.</P>
<P>CLXXXIV. Thirst and heat, which do not less di∣stinguish asthenic, than sthenic diseases, and are not less
<PB N="99" REF="022373_0113_0FB86A894A5C3CA8"/>
frequent symptoms, arise from the asthenic diathesis in the throat, and on the surface of the body, checking, in the latter case, the perspiration; in the former, the ex∣cretion of the saliva, the exhalable fluid, and the mucus, <HI>and that</HI> from the atony and relaxation of the extreme vessels. In consequence of the former, the throat being not sufficiently lubricated with a due quantity of its res∣pective fluids, is scorched with thirst. The effect of the latter is, that, the perspirable fluid being detained under the cuticle, together with it the heat, which in a free perspiration usually goes off in waste into the air, and remains nearly of the same degree, is accumula∣ted and encreases. But the encrease of heat depends not on the state of excitement, or, as it is commonly called, the principle of life, since it happens both in the sthenic diathesis, and, likewise in indirect, as well as direct, de∣bility. But the weakness of the vessels on the surface of the body, under which the throat, and whatever part is accessible to air, is comprehended, is a part of the debility of the heart and arteries; the latter a part of that of the whole system.</P>
<P>CLXXXV. This asthenic thirst, which is a much more frequent and more violent affection than the sthenic, is preceded by loss of appetite; the loss of appetite by loath∣ing of food; it is succeeded by sickness at stomach, vo∣miting, often an acute pain of the stomach, and other troublesome symptoms; the explanation of which we next proceed to.</P>
<P>CLXXXVI. Want of appetite, loathing of food<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">These symptoms of want of appetite, loathing of food, thirst, sickness at stomach, vomiting, and acute pain of the stomach, as well as those that follow to the CXCV. and from that to the CXCVIII. form a chain of symptoms depending upon encreasing debility, which, instead of being different in kind, are all connected by an uniform operation of nature. And they furnish an instructive instance of the erroneous mode of judging of the nature of symptoms, and morbid affections, which has been so prevalent in all systems of physic, that we are yet acquainted with. However different in appearance, they are not only similar, but all unite in forming one and the same kind of disease, one and the same morbid affection: which is proved by their arising all from one and the same set of hurtful powers, to wit, debilitating; and by their being cu∣red by one and the same set of remedies, to wit, stimulant. The former powers may vary in degree, but they are all debilitating; and the latter may also act with different degrees of force, but they are all stimulant. And the state of the system, from which the former constitute a devia∣tion, as well as that, to which the latter produce a return, is health, which is always the same.</NOTE>, de∣pend upon a debility of the whole body; as is proved by all
<PB N="100" REF="022373_0114_0FB86A8B7B3B8748"/>
the debilitating antecedent powers that produce them, always acting by debilitating; and by all the remedies, which both prevent and cure them, always acting by a stimulant and strengthening operation. The cause of appetite is a strong and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound contraction of the fibres of the stomach, by which digestion is supported<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">The fibres of the stomach are muscular, and partly longitudinal, partly oblique, or approaching to circular. When the food is taken in, the former are contracted and shortened, by which they raise the un∣der part of the stomach, which is unfixt upwards. These gradually re∣lax as the food, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> digestion in this organ, and its conversion into a more fluid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm, in the same gradual manner, passes out of the pylorus, or under orifice of the stomach This operation takes off the distending weight in the direction from above downward; and, as the food, in proportion to its conversion from a more solid to a more fluid form, is more and more collected into the under part of the cavity of the stomach, this gives a pressure in the lateral way, and, therefore, throws the other fibres into contraction, by which the sides of the sto∣mach are squeezed together, and, thereby, perform the office of throw∣ing out, by the pylorus, the remaining part of the alimentary matter. Besides these successive actions, the muscular substance of the stomach is so constructed as to be provided with fibres, the motion of which, when the stomach is full, is upward and downward; when empty downward only. All these motions give the alimentary matter the mechanical agi∣tation necessary to promote its mixture.</NOTE>, and the excretion of a
<PB N="101" REF="022373_0115_0FB86A8C55BF17C8"/>
fluid, such as the gastric<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">or fluid peculiarly secreted and excreted in the stomach.</NOTE> liquor, such as the saliva<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">The gastric fluid, poured into the cavity of the stomach, as well as the saliva that follows it from the palate, and the watery or other drink taken in by the mouth, contribute to change the food more and more into a fluid consistence, which is a change only of its form; but, by certain means, a change also of its nature, called in chemistry proper mixture, takes place. This change is chiefly effected by the gastric fluid, to which, perhaps, a certain relation that the other fluids bear to the a∣limentary matter in this living organ, contributes. Another means of promoting the solution that goes on in this process is the heat of the stomach.</NOTE> and to the effect of both a certain emptiness of the sto∣mach is necessary. But none of these circumstances can take place in a <HI>state</HI> of debility. The fibres do not con∣tract with force; the extreme vessels do not pour out their fluids; the matter of food, formerly taken in, is not dis∣solved, and properly mixed, and in that state thrown out of the stomach; but continues in a great measure unchan∣ged and indissolved. Hence it is, that there is no appetite for food, and in a higher degree of it, that a loathing takes place.</P>
<P>CLXXXVII. In the same manner has thirst been ex∣plained<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See par. CLXXXIV.</NOTE>; and in the same manner is the sickness at sto∣mach, which is a higher degree <HI>of affection</HI> from the same cause; for when there is strength and vigour, sensation is most agreeable in every part of the system, as well as in thestomach and neighbouring parts.</P>
<P>CLXXXVIII. With respect to vomiting; it is the chief of all these affections, that we have been speaking of: for to such a height has the atony and laxity of the fibres <HI>in the stomach</HI> gone, when it comes on; to such a degree has the collection of crude nasty matters proceeded, and the distention of the stomach from these last, and air let loose <HI>is become so exquisite,</HI> that the fibres are oppressed, and can∣not
<PB N="102" REF="022373_0116_0FB86A8DC40098E0"/>
perform their motion from the upper to the lower part, which is commonly called the peristaltic motion. And, as in every case, both of health and disease, the tendency of that motion is always from the stimulus in an opposite direction; downward when the stimulus proceeds from the mouth, and upwards when it comes from the stomach; in that way it is that the crudities, and air let loose, of which mention has been made, acting as a local stimulus, direct all the motion, that they excite, towards the up∣per parts <HI>of the canal.</HI> This inverted motion, being con∣trary to nature, can never be agreeable; and hence, be∣fore the arrival of the vomiting, stomach-sickness, arises; which when it continues for any time, must be violent, because the local stimulus rouses the muscular fibres into violent and irregular motions.</P>
<P>CLXXXIX. The cause of pain in the stomach and in∣testines, and other parts, both internal and external, under a sthenic diathesis, is spasm. Spasm in any internal cavity, that is, in the organs of involuntary motion, is, by means of the debility in common <HI>to its seat</HI> with the whole body, a relaxation and atony of the fibres, and together with that a distending matter; what constitutes that matter in the stomach is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ordes or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul crudities, in the intestines; hardened excrement; in both air let loose. The effect of this matter in the distention that it gives, does not so much depend upon itself as upon the lax state of the fibres di∣stended by it; for the fibres, when strong and vigorous, easily repel the distending power, which overpowers them in this state: but the relaxed fibres, of which we are speak∣ing, yield more and more, <HI>and that</HI> in proportion to the urgent force exerted on them, till losing all power of re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition or contraction, all power of relaxation, they con∣tinue immoveably contracted. All which happens accor∣ding to the nature of that property in muscular fibres, by which, when they are stretched, they do not, like com∣mon
<PB N="103" REF="022373_0117_0FB86A8F8583AAB8"/>
elastic matter, only contract when the distending power is removed, but even while it remains. During such action and suffering, the sensible fibres undergo a cer∣tain violence; and hence the pain. But, that more is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttributed to their own laxity, than the distending mat∣ter, is proved by stimulants restoring the tone and density, which are exactly in proportion to each other, as depen∣ding upon the same cause; by which means contracting in the manner of sound fibres, and powerfully reacting, they, without any assistance, as has lately been ascertained, restore the peristaltic motion, and drive downward before them the matter still remaining, and still continuing to distend<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">The prevailing notion with respect to this kind of affection has been, and still is, that its cause is the matter here spoken of, which is only an effect of the cause, and that its cure, when the affection is in the stomach, is vomiting to carry off the supposed cause. But its true cause is the laxity of the fibres, and their atony from the general debility, yielding to the distending force of the matter, and thereby losing their tone and density more and more; while vomiting therefore encreases, stimulating removes the disease.</NOTE>. In this way wine, aromatics, and volatile al∣kali, and, above all the rest, the various forms of opium, dislodge from its seat <HI>all</HI> such <HI>hurtful</HI> matter without either vomiting or purging, and that without any difficulty, and in a very short space of time.</P>
<P>CXC. The pain, which is so often troublesome in the external parts of the body, also depends upon spasm, but not with the conjunction of a distending matter. And a power takes the place of it, which is not to be referred to any matter, but to a certain effort of the will in moving a limb<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See LVIII,</NOTE>. By means of that the spasm is excited in the same manner as in the other case, by distention, and often with the most exquisite pain, where, as the effect is the same, that is, a spasm, arising from debility, and to be removed
<PB N="104" REF="022373_0118_0FB86A9484396BC0"/>
by restoring the strength; for that reason the cause also must be the same, and be reducible to debility, together with something that altogether resembles debility, and pos∣sess a power equal to it. In this way <HI>of reasoning</HI><NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">a way of reasoning never made use of in medicine before, but which runs through, and influences most of the propositions in this work. It is further to be observed, that, upon no occasion, can we ever arrive at an adequate knowledge of abstract causes; that the eagerness of mankind to rush into wild and fanciful explanations of them, without any regard to real phaenomena of nature, has been the cause of all the false phaenomena that ever appeared in the world, and that the only sure and faithful guide to the study of causes is a cautious and painful in∣vestigation of the effects and phaenomena of nature that proceed from them. See more upon this important subject, and, indeed, a complete discussion of it, in my book, entitled, "Observations on the old Sys∣tems of Physic."</NOTE> we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may often safely rise from <HI>the contemplation of</HI> known effect to that of unknown cause. The pain we speak of at present <HI>is that which</HI> respects the spasms of the muscles.</P>
<P>CXCI. There is another pain, less confined to the same part, more diffused, and equally troublesome, which is not supported by distention but by another local stimulus, equally arising from debility, of equal <HI>tendency</HI> to encrease the debility, and, by its debilitating operation, together with the other symptoms of debility, hastening on death. This pain arises from a concentrated acid, which is some∣times predominent in the alimentary canal, when under the influence of great debility, of which cholera chiefly is a clear example; but, besides that, all the affections of the alimentary canal, that are accompained with vomit∣ing and a loose belly, are more or less examples of it.</P>
<P>CXCII. This acid is not the primary cause, but only a symptom supervening upon the disease, already formed in consequence of the debility, its proper cause, and now fully established, arising from the same source as the other symptoms, and to be removed by the same remedies.
<PB N="105" REF="022373_0119_0FB86A96C7FF41A8"/>
When the same acid has arisen, it continues to encrease all debility that happens to be predominant, either in the first passages, or in the rest of the body: And, while it exerts that operation over the whole body, its influence is in the part where it exists, and where the diminution of the force of the disease is most wanted.</P>
<P>CXCIII. But, though it be itself in that way the offspring of debility, and of a tendency to create further debility, in the same manner as spasm has been said <HI>to be;</HI> still there is not, either for the sake of changing, or throw∣it out of the body, occasion for any other indication of cure: For, as it has its rise at first from a general cause, so upon that it all along depends; whatever has the effect of overcoming the other symptoms, has also that of over∣coming this. For that purpose it is, that, as in the case of spasm, stimulants, not emetics, nor purgatives, nor a∣ny other debilitating powers, are required.</P>
<P>CXCIV. As the acid, which has been mentioned, pro∣duces the pain in the internal parts, or in the organs of in∣voluntary motion; so in the external parts, or organs of voluntary motion, it is occasioned by something that pro∣duces the same effect as the acid, that depends upon the will, and acts in conjuction with the convulsive <HI>state;</HI> and, as in the case of spasm, there is no matter that cor∣responds with the distending, so in this there is none to correspond with that which produces the pain. Nay, as the spasmodic case is represented by any cramp of the muscles, so is the convulsive by any convulsion, but, above all, by epilepsy. Finally, as in the former, the same rea∣soning from known effect to unknown cause proves the sameness of the external and internal case, it equally proves their sameness in the latter<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">All this reasoning with respect to spasm and convulsion, show∣ing them to be the same, and only a part in the whole, a link in the chain of the other asthenic affections, which have been mentioned, as well as the facts and arguments next to be brought, which will serve to prove all that follow to be also the same, is, of itself, of the highest im∣portance to mankind. In a particular manner, the whole tribe of dis∣eases of the alimentary canal, and almost all those of children, all, in∣deed, but the contagious eruptive ones, are both explained, and their principle of cure ascertained, with geometrical exactness, Here, then, at once is a discovery, upon scientific principles, of the true nature, and certain cure, of more than one-half of the diseases of the human race; the method of cure arising from this doctrine having never failed in any of them, and never succeeded upon a contrary plan, the debilitating and evacuant, so universally recommended by the authority of the schools. The spasms and convulsions of the external parts, unless when immode∣rate in degree, are equally certainly removed by the new method, and even epilepsy and tetanus yield to it.</NOTE>.</P>

CXCV. The simple course <HI>of morbid affection</HI> from its slightest to its most violent degree (to take a review of the subjects from the place where we set out), is, that begins with loss of appetite, and is brought on by want of the sup∣ports of food and of other stimli, or by an overproportion of stimuli, and proceeds through all the intermediate de∣grees to spasmodic or convulsive pain. For the reasons lately assigned, there is first no appetite for food, and if the patient perseveres in the debilitating process of cure, and food is not administered, such, suppose, as can be taken in the form of soups, a loathing of it follows. By-and-by, if still nothing is used to produce stimulant effect, thirst will come on; there will be the most keen desire for the most debilitating power, cold water, which will be preferred to the greatest dainties, and will be greedily swallowed<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">When this asthenic thirst comes on, it is the highest luxury in nature to be allowed a free indulgence in the use of cold water, which is always hurtful in proportion to the degree of its coldness.</NOTE>. To this stomach sickness immediately succeeds, which, unless prevented by a diffusible stimulus, such as a glass of the most pure and strong spirit, or, failing that, another,
<PB N="107" REF="022373_0121_0FB86A9B84666378"/>
perhaps, <HI>in some cases</HI> a third, rushes instantly on to vomiting. When the affection rises a little higher, during the vomiting a violent pain arises in the stomach, <HI>giving a sensation</HI> as if there were a bar of iron in it, forcibly stretching and tear∣ing it across<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">A lady, after nursing her twelfth child for seven months, was found by her husband, a physician well acquainted with the new doctrine, very low spirited one evening. She was of a delicate, thin, exhausted habit, and had been subject often before, towards the end of her peri∣ods of nursing, to loss of appetite, colic, dejection of spirit, and as often cured by removing the child from her breast, and putting her upon a rich stimulant regimen. Her friend and physician perceiving the cause of her dejection, ordered two of their daughters, who happened to be grown up, to sit up and rock the child in the cradle all night, and also watch their mother to administer to her the things he had ordered. They themselves went to bed. The reader should have been informed, that such was this lady's lowness of spirits, that tears bursted from her eyes upon hearing the sudden order for the weaning of the infant. He fell asleep; but in an hour's time was wakened by the noise of a most violent vomiting she had fallen into. She had a pain in her stomach at the same time, from her account of which the description above was taken. All this had been occasioned by her applying the child's mouth to her nip∣ple.</NOTE>. When the affection becomes still more severe, and the cause <HI>of the disease</HI> still higher in degree, every kind of torture is undergone; an head-ach comes on with a feeling of strokes like those given by an hammer. These symptoms of disturbance are communicated to the alimentary canal, for the most part not immediately, but in consequence of the disease remaining, and lurking, with an intervention of intervals of deceitful respite. The belly is often affected with gripes and great pains, and ex∣ceedingly loose; but, which will not be wondered at in an inverted state of the peristaltic motion, it is oftener con∣stipated, and, from time to time, undergoes all the vi∣cissitudes of alternate vomiting and purging. Among the troublesome symptoms, that have been mentioned, are comprehended dyspepsia, <HI>called in common</HI> English Indi∣gestion,
<PB N="108" REF="022373_0122_0FB86A9CC0675138"/>
the gout, diarrhoea, or <HI>lose-belly,</HI> dysentery, or the bloody-flux, cholera<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">or that disease, the urgent symptom of which is alternate vomiting and purging, the effect of which, while their cause is a general weak∣ness over all, but prevalent in the first passages, is to encrease the weak∣ness, from which they proceed to such a degree, as to hurry on the pa∣tient's death, with every symptom of expiring debility, in the short space of sixteen hours. This happens in the warm countries, as the southern parts of Europe, and especially in the torrid zone, whether in Asia, Africa, or America.</NOTE>, the colic<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">The colic has been commonly treated by purging and bleeding, and low diet; but in no instance has that treatment of it been successful. Opiates were particularly forbidden upon the supposition of their constipa∣ting the belly; but the truth is, that the colic, as well as diarrhoea (which has been supposed a disease of an opposite nature, from the seeming con∣trariety of looseness of the belly, and costiveness to each other), are the same kind of affection, only differing in degree. And the colic is to be removed by no other means than those that remove the simple looseness; that is by durable and diffusible stimulants.</NOTE>, the iliac<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">which is that higher degree of colic where vomiting comes on, and the peristaltic motion is so inverted as to occasion the rejection of stercoraceous matter by the mouth. Sometimes in the progress of the same disease, especially when treated only by evacuation and bleeding, a portion of gut is insinuated into the cavity of the next portion. This is called in the art Volvulus, or Intus Susceptio. The quick and effec∣tual cure of colic before the symptoms of volvulus make their appearance, is a good proof that the latter is induced by the purgative medicines, em∣ployed to clear away the obstructing cause, acting with such relaxing effect, and urgent violence, as to turn back the inverted motion in one part, while it continues inverted in all the rest, and particularly in the portion next to it. The ordinary evacuant plan, therefore, is a cause of the violence of the disease in all its stages; and lastly, of the last, which becomes a local and immoveable affection. Nothing could be more absurd than the reason∣ing that has directed the practice of physicians. In which, besides the general rules of bleeding to cure bleeding, vomiting to cure vomiting▪ and purging to cure purging, and besides the contradiction of employing purging in colic, which by the last rule only applies to diarrhoea; they have taken in into their head, that a good means of removing the ob∣structing matter in colic, was to throw in a large quantity of heavy sub∣stance with the intention of forcibly displacing it; reasoning in that way not so well as a soldier would do in clearing away any soul matter from his fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lock; for it should have been remembered, that whatever effect such substances, as quicksilver, might have by their weight in pushing downward any obstructing matter, they must operate with a contrary effect, as often as in the convoluted state of the intestinal canal, the course of any portion was upward.

the green purging of infants, the worms, <HI>that wasting of the body called</HI> Tabes, or Consumption, and atrophia<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">These two diseases, according to a theory that has at all times prevailed in the schools, and has pervaded all medical systems, are sup∣posed to originate from an obstruction in the mesentric glands, through which the chyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or alimentary matter, after undergoing a double pre∣paration, one in the stomach, and another in the first convolutions of the intestines, has to pass before it arrives at its common receptacle, the thoracic duct, in order to be thrown into the venous mass of blood; and to remove it, still upon the same idea, as if all the cavities of the animal economy, whether great or small, were to be cleansed, like the soldier's firelock, no limits were s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the use of gentle aperients, and particularly the use of mineral waters. And they used gravely to tell us, that with the help of a course of time, suppose the arrival of the in∣fant, or child, at the seventh year of his age, that would carry off the disease by its detergent operation, provided the obstruction were not so great as to induce death before the lapse of that period. That all this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illy theory devoid of all foundation in truth, is proved by the completion of hundreds of cures in the shortest spaces of time, by means of durable stimuli, which act upon their delicate frames with such efficacy as to su∣percede, unless in the most violent cases, all use of the diffusible. This remark applies likewise to worms, for the cure of which no bounds were set to the use of purgatives, upon the idea of clearing away the stuff in which this vermin nestled; a practice not so judicious as that of some foolish boys, who place their success in bird-catching upon the chance of bringing down the nests from the top of high trees, by throwing sticks and stones at them; while other boys, both more sensible and alert, climb up and seize every one of them. The cause of worms is the same as that of all the other diseases we have spoken of, differing in nothing but in what they all differ from each other, mere degree. Debility over all, but prevalent in the alimentary canal, occasions a weakness both in all the other functions, and particularly in that of the peristaltic motion. This state implies a similar weakness in the vessels that pour their fluids into that cavity; their weakness implies an enlargement of their diame∣ters, and that enlargement an encrease of the quantity of fluids thrown in, without any encreased impulse behind. Hence arises a colluvies of matter, which the encreased peristaltic motion is not able to throw off. The colluvies is encreased by the use of vegetable matter and fruit taken into the stomach, and depositing their feculent parts on the intestines. The indication of cure is not to encrease either the general, or particu∣lar part of the cause, by purging, and the use of other debilitating pow∣ers, but to strengthen the whole living system; and especially the intes∣tinal canal, by the whole round of stimulant remedies diffusible or dura∣ble. To this treatment the tabes and atrophia will yield in a few days, or even hours; the worms in as many weeks. And they are all increased by the common plan of cure, as universal experience has proved to a demonstration.</NOTE>,

<P>CXCVI. As the cause of the disease proceeds, and the exciting hurtful powers prove more urgent; the external parts are drawn into consent, and now the organs of vo∣luntary motion are affected. Sometimes the legs, some∣times the arms, and other parts, <HI>differently upon different occasions,</HI> are tortured with cramps; sometimes the thorax variously all round; sometimes the shoulders, sometimes the sides, sometimes the back, sometimes the neck, are affected with pain, from which pains no part of the hu∣man body is exempted, <HI>and</HI> the region of the lungs, of the liver, and of the stomach, are especially liable to them. The smart pains that affect those parts, and are supposed to
<PB N="111" REF="022373_0125_0FB86AA486415180"/>
proceed from internal inflammation, are, in reality, owing to spasmodic or convulsive affection<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Endless have been the bleedings and other evacuations employed to remove those painful affections, and as dismal has been the effect of that method of cure. The universal rule, suggested by the principles, and confirmed by the practice of this new doctrine, is to invigorate the whole system, and apply any diffusible stimulus, particularly laudanum, to the pained parts. By that practice I know not one cure, of some hundreds, that either I or my pupils have performed, that has failed. The gout will sometimes make its attack in this way. But whatever be the particular force of disease, with which they may seem to have any connection, the only diagnosis here necessary is to be sure that the true peripneumony is not the morbid state. When that is out of the ques∣tion, and whether the painful complaint be denominated bastard peri∣pneumony or not, the only indication of cure is what has been just now mentioned. A young lady, with whom I am nearly and tenderly con∣nected, has been often affected with an acute pain in her right side, most∣ly fixed and solitary, sometimes accompanied with a certain numbness and senselessness in her extremeties, commonly with l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of appetite, and some degree of head-ach. The effectual method of cure is to apply rags dipped in ladanum, volatile alkali, or aether, and renew them as often as they become dry, and to support her internally with durable and diffusible stimuli, proportioned in kind and quantity to the exigenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the case. This method of cure of a morbid affection, that upon the contrary debilitating evacuant plan would be readily and quickly con∣verted into an incurable asthenic disease, has always proved infallible in removing the attacks, which never after return but when she has enfee∣bled herself by keeping the house too much, and neglecting air, exercise, and the use of the other diffusible stimuli. Friction used over all the af∣fected parts, is also found useful in supporting the stimulant operation of all the other remedies. There is in the fens of Lincoln, where an e∣minent physician, and follower of this doctrine, practises, a disease call∣ed a bastard peripneumony; in which, though it had always baffled all the efforts of the common evacuant practice, he never lost a patient, by exercising the contrary one.</NOTE>. That this is their true origin is proved by the renewal of stimuli, remo∣ving the affections, often immediately, always in a short time, and reproducing the healthy state. It is proved by
<PB N="112" REF="022373_0126_0FB86AA6123B1188"/>
the unsuccessfulness of the contrary method of cure, <HI>which proceeds</HI> upon bleeding, the various modes of purgation and abstinence. Nay, what even makes more for the same conclusion, is, that, while abstinence almost alone is often sufficient to produce the pains, rich diet also alone has been sufficient to remove them<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">This I have often experienced in the case of the gout. Before dinner, when my stomach was empty, I have limped in going abroad to dine. But after having made that meal heartily, and taken a glass or two of wine, have returned with a perfect firm step, and free from all feeling of pain and uneasiness.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CXCVII. The same pains, sometimes combined with enormous motion<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">as in the convulsive kind so lately spoke of, where the enormity of motion is sometimes external and in the organs of voluntary motion, sometimes internal, as in cholera and so forth.</NOTE> sometimes without it<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">as in the spasmodic pains, head-ach, pains in the legs and soies, where there is an inability to perform the due motion.</NOTE>, are abso∣lutely free from inflammation. To distinguish them, then from the pains that flow from inflammation or a similar o∣rigin, the concourse of <HI>accompanying</HI> symptoms must be at∣tended to. Sthenic diathesis points out <HI>that whatever</HI> pains <HI>occur</HI> are sthenic; and the information received from the asthenic diathesis is, that the pains <HI>appearing in it are parti∣cipant of its nature</HI> and as certainly asthenic. This remark is of deep application to diseases of daily occurrence, and overturns the common practice. Even head-ach, which is so frequent an affection, is ten times to be removed by the stimulant plan, for once that the contrary answers<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">The true reason for all this, and innumerable errors in the prac∣tice, is that the leaders in the profession never understood any diathesis but a sthenic one, or any indication of cure but an asthenic, to which they gave the name of an antiphlogistic, as they did that of phlogistic to the diathesis. By his reformation of the erroneous plan of cure, that his cotemporaries, the Alexipharmacs, had introduced, in the small-pox and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew other sthenic diseases that ever occur, in all the rest of the ge∣neral diseases, Dr Sydenham's authority confirmed the error. He left also the measles as he had found that disease, and all other general dis∣eases, which are much more in frequency than 97 out of the 100, or 97 to 3 of the sthenic. Great men had need to be cautious, as the least in∣advertency in them, not to say essential mistakes, never fails to lead their followers, who are commonly servile imitators, and implicit believers, into capital error. If ever they attempt any thing of themselves it is commonly to raise a crazy superstructure upon a false foundation, it is commonly to refine upon error ad infinitum.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="022373_0127_0FB86AA7448E90A0"/>
CXCVIII. Symptoms of disturbance occur also in as∣thenic diseases as well as the sthenic. Such a state of dis∣turbance takes place in the alimentary canal in the cases of hysteria, colic, dyspepsy, and the gout. Thus in the alimentary canal, besides the pains, mentioned above, a certain sense of burning, anguish, contortion and direful torture, <HI>exhibit a set of appearances,</HI> formidable in the high∣est degree, both to the patient and by-standers, and which beget a suspicion of their proceeding from inflammation as their cause. But those affections have nothing to do with inflammation as their cause, and that they depend upon a state of the part quite the reverse, has been proved by the the stimulant method of curing them turning out successful in every instance in which it has been tried<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Till this doctrine appeared, it was impossible to erase from the minds of physicians an impression that had been deeply made there, that, nothing but the only inflammation, that they were acquainted with, could be the cause of such pain and torture, as is described in the text. I have more than once experienced the whole concourse, here mention∣ed, and have always found them to yield to the most stimulant method of cure, that I could contrive. I once laboured under this modification of asthenic disease for no less than ten days, and was always able to over∣come it in two hours, and procure an interval of complete ease and re∣lief for the rest of the day. The remedies employed were the whole round of diffusible stimuli, as opiates in all their forms, camphor, musk, volatile alkali, and aether, &amp;c. By these the functions for the time were completely restored. But their stimulant effect was no sooner perfectly gone off, that is, after the interposition of a long sleep, through the night, than the symptoms returned with a violence little short of what it had been the day before. This was proof positive, that their nature was asthenic, or consisting in debility; since they yielded to stimulant reme∣dies; and that the debility was exquisitely great, since it required so high a degree of stimulant operation to remove it. While that is the undoubted fact, there is a nicety with respect to proportion to be attend∣ed to in this case. It is a rule, that the degree of curative means, whe∣ther in the cure of sthenic or asthenic diseases, should be accommodated to the degree of the diseased state or degree of the cause. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little of the curative means is employed a proportional part of the disease will remain: if too much, the disease will be more than removed, that is, another state which may be morbid in another extreme, may take place. Too much was once employed in this affection, and the effect was, that the disease was not eradicated till the tenth day of its course from the beginning.</NOTE>. The same
<PB N="114" REF="022373_0128_0FB86AA9160A5198"/>
fact is confirmed by the use of wine, opium and other diffusible stimuli. After that, and still in conjunction with their use, animal soups, and next solid meat, and the usual way of living, and guarding against debility, effectually re-establish the healthy state<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">The rule here is, if indirect debility be the cause, to begin with a high degree of stimulant cure, and gradually reduce it to the ordinay de∣gree that is sufficient for the healthy state. And the caution is to be sure of this gradual reduction, otherwise the indirect debility will be liable to return the moment the effect of the stimuli is gone off. By an attention of this kind a disease depending upon indirect debility may be cured in in the sixth part of the time, that would be taken up by the cure, when the remedies are every day carried beyond the due bounds. For exam∣ple, if the indirect debility be in the table the effect of an application of 71 degrees of exciting power instead of 40, that is to say, the excitement is worn down to 9 instead of being up at 40; it is evident, that an appli∣cation of 71 degrees by way of remedies, will leave the disease where it was. Suppose only 65 degrees of stimulant power administered; the ex∣citement will fall to 66 and the wasted excitability rise to 15. Next day let only a degree of exciting power as 60 be applied; then the degree of excitement will be that number, and that of excitability 20. Five degrees of exciting power still less will reduce the morbid excitement to 55, and raise the excitability to 25. And so on may the matter go, till the excitability is raised to 40 and the excitement reduced to the same number. But, if the reduction be much less by the day, the cure will be proportionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lower. Nay, such an error may be committed as to encrease the disease instead of reducing it, which will happen, as often as a degree of stimulant power is applied, which is more than equivalent to that which produced the disease. All this attention and caution is ne∣cessary in the cure of asthenic diseases of indirect debility; while that of those of direct debility is easy and simple, to wit, to give the stimulants in small proportion and often repeated, till the disease is removed, un∣less, which may happen, you can guess the proportion, which may suf∣fice to remove the disease at once, or, at least, twice.</NOTE>. This plan
<PB N="115" REF="022373_0129_0FB86AADF08B7D80"/>
of cure proves to a demonstration, that those affections are most foreign both from sthenic inflammation and every de∣gree of sthenic diathesis; <HI>and,</HI> besides the general sthenic inflammation, not appearing to affect internal parts, it af∣fords another argument against inflammation in this case being the cause<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">See CLXXXII. and CLXXXIII. par. above.</NOTE>.</P>

But truly, that there is no inflammation at all here, at least as a cause, and that the disease <HI>depends upon</HI> pure debility, is sufficiently proved by the arguments that have been brought before. The disease is encreased by the antiphlogistic, and diminished, and removed, by the stimulant plan of cure.</P>
<P>CC. The formidable symptoms of disturbance, that accompany epilepsy, apoplexy, and fevers, such as stu∣por, a disposition to sleep, in them all; in fevers often that false watching, that is called typhomania, and some∣times coma<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">or an insuperable proneness to sleep,</NOTE>; in the latter,(or fevers), starting of the tendons, in the former,(or epilepsy and apoplexy), con∣vulsion or a diminution of the voluntary motions; which by most physicians have been partly imputed to irritation<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">No diseases are more opposite to each other than high sthenic dis∣eases, such as the common inflammatory fever, or peripneumony, and proper fevers; the former, in the table, standing at the head of the scale of encreased excitement, and the latter at the bottom of the scale of diminished excitement. And the same method for the cure of both has been pursued, to wit, the evacuant, debilitating. If, in peripneu∣mony, large quantities of blood were taken at a time, the difference has been made up in the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of fevers by repeating it the oftener; while all the other evacuations were carried on with the same profusion in both. When they talked of the respective causes of those diseases, phlo∣gistic diathesis was the word for the high sthenic diseases, and irritation for the high asthenic. But these were words only, while in fact the me∣thod of treatment of both was the same, at least, in kind; and scarcely different in degree. To whatever part of any system of physic we turn our attention, we constantly see one mode of practice running through the whole, and that too, notwithstanding of the supposed great number of diseases, very limited. It turns all upon bleeding, other evacuati∣ons, starving, and some other trifling directions under the title of regi∣men. It was all antiphlogistic to use their own language; and whate∣ver other language they held, the nature of the disease, if we are to judge from their treatment, was phlogistic.</NOTE>,
<PB N="117" REF="022373_0131_0FB86AB3D97161C8"/>
as typhomania and the starting of the tendons; partly to plethora, either alone and pure, or together with it mobi∣lity: All these without distinction are evidently owing to the same cause, upon which all asthenic diseases depend, that is debility. Which is proved by the debilitating hurtful powers, whether acting directly or indirectly, alone producing those diseases; and by the remedies, the whole action of which depends on stimulus, alone relieving or removing them. But it is in vain to impute apoplexy to plethora<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">or an over proportion of blood, see above, CXXXI.</NOTE>; as if at that time of life, when the body is nearly worn out and almost bloodless, that is, when the usual <HI>degree</HI> of aliment is neither desired, nor taken in nor digested, more blood could be produced than in the flower and vigour of human life. On the contrary, at the time when apoplexy comes on, in consequence of indirect debility, induced by old age and excessive excitement in the mode of living, the solids are languid, the quantity of fluids deficient, as also their fountain, the blood. Epilepsy depends upon the same debility, and the same scantiness of fluids, only that its debility is oftener of the direct kind. Fevers may depend upon indirect debility, as in the con∣fluent small-pox<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">The confluent small-pox, as depending upon a very high degree of debility, is ranked among the high fevers in the after part of this work, because the scale is not regulated by the appellations given by physicians, or by any of their erroneous distinctions, but by strict re∣gard to the degree of excitement. And for the same reason is the vio∣lent cholera marked nearly in the same place; because the debility, ta∣king place in it, is nearly equal in degree to the most sinking febrile de∣bility; in a word, because the same degree of debilitating power produ∣ces, and the same degree of stimulant operation, removes the diseases so assorted</NOTE>, or where drunkenness has been the principal hurtful power producing them, but at the same time their most frequent cause is direct debility. And in
<PB N="118" REF="022373_0132_0FB86AB4C9EA40F8"/>
all the cases, that have been just now mentioned, debility is the primary cause and final termination both of all the rest of the symptoms and of those of disturbance.</P>
<P>CCI. To the symptoms of disturbance sometimes also belong the following that affect the head; great head-ach in fevers, imbecillity of the intellectual function, confusion of thought, and delirium, <HI>the last</HI> often sufficiently fierce, though occuring in the highest degrees of debility, and leading to efforts beyond the strength. This state often happens towards the end of a nervous fever, eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when violent. Inflammation is apprehended, blood is let, but directly from the head; blisters, which are extreme unction in the art, are clapped on, silence and darkness are prescribed, even the most gentle stimulants are forbid. In consequence of the emptiness of the stomach, as well as of the vessels of the whole body, and of the highest de∣gree of languor from the want of many stimuli, vertigo is superadded to delirium, and the patient, deprived of strength, sense and intellect, breaths out his last.</P>
<P>CCII. But in this case there is either no inflammation, or, if there be, it is altogether of a different nature from the general sthenic one. That it is not the latter, the unsuccessfulness of the debilitating plan of cure, and the incredible success of that which first stimulates, and after fills the vessels, afford certain proof: And that it is not any other inflammation is evinced by the so sudden resti∣tution of health. Now, as an impaired use, or confusion of the intellectual faculty is, in a certain degree, always the consequence of debility, whether arising from any other source, or from emptiness, or a general inanition of the vessels, <HI>and that too</HI> even in those, who are otherwise sound; where is the wonder if, in the highest degree of inanition, compatible with life, in the highest degree of diminution of excitement, scarcely leaving a shadow of
<PB N="119" REF="022373_0133_0FB86AB6456E26E8"/>
life, also the highest degree of failure in the intellectual function, that is, delirium, among other instances of im∣paired function, should take place. Nay this very fact is certain, and proved to a demonstration. Thus famine, thus drinking water contrary to custom, after a course of drinking to excess, or both eating and drinking with in∣temperance, a gloomy state of the animal spirits, grief, terror, despair, not only induce a temporary delirium, but frequently bring on downright madness. The same conclusion applies to any considerable loss of blood. For how many persons, after being wounded either in line of battle or on the highway, have never after, and often du∣ring a long life time, come to the right use of their sen∣ses. To say nothing of contusions, wounds and other injuries, by which the texture of the brain is injured, as belonging to local diseases, of which we are to treat af∣terwards; how does cold induce death? Is it not, amidst a diminution of all the other fuctions, by a delirium pre∣ceding death? From these facts, of such weight, both from their number and validity, and that bring forward all the powers in support of the argument, it must be ad∣mitted, that both head-ach, and every failure of the in∣tellectual function, in every degree, and that highest de∣gree of such failure, delirium, depend not at all upon general sthenic inflammation, the only <HI>inflammation</HI> hi∣therto known; but arise from the highest deficiency, both of other stimuli, and of that, which depends upon a proper fulness in the vessels, that is, debility. Debility then is the most frequent cause of the symptoms, that have been mentioned, as is proved by the restoration of health so quickly upon the new plan of cure.</P>
<P>CCIII. But if ever the asthenic inflammation, menti∣oned<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See above, paragraph CLXXI. and CCII. It is to be defined in the next paragraph.</NOTE> before, excited the tumult of symptoms, which

<P>CCIV. The general asthenic inflammation is nothing else but asthenic diathesis, somewhat more violent in a part than in any other equal part<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See above, paragraph XLIX.</NOTE>; <HI>and upon this footing,</HI> that the degree of asthenic diathesis <HI>constituting</HI> the inflam∣mation is by no means to be compared with the degree of diathesis in all the rest of the system; because the affec∣tion diffused over the whole body is far greater than that confined to a part<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See above, XLVIII. XLIX. L. LI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCV. Inflammation, in this case, is nothing else, but a state of the inflamed part, of <HI>the same kind</HI> with that of <HI>all</HI> the rest of the body. And, as the inflammation is constituted by a lesser excitement in a part, than in any other equal part; so, before the arrival of the disease<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CLXIX. and compare it with this. The meaning in both is, that, as certain parts of the system have more excitability than other (LI.), so those parts, which in the diseased state are more affected than any other, that is, are either more excited, as in sthenic inflamma∣tion, or less, as in asthenic, than any other, keep up the same proportion of disparity before the arrival of the disease, before the appearance of any of the symptoms, and while, as yet, nothing but mere predisposition has taken place. The truth of this proposition is established by that of another so comprehensive as to extend to the whole subject of life; which is, that over the whole living creation, throughout the universe, health, predisposition to disease, and disease itself, are the same state, only dif∣fering in degree, (vid. par. XXIII. and LXV.) Health, therefore, is also comprehended under this same proposition.</NOTE>, of which the inflammation is a part, a symptom, or se∣quel, the excitement of that part is understood to be pro∣portionally less, than that of any other part.</P>
<P>CCVI. This inflammation<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">mentioned in the two last paragraph <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> should be distinguished from another, which is local: It <HI>is</HI> general, and depends
<PB N="121" REF="022373_0135_0FB86AB9508B4E48"/>
upon a general diathesis and only happens when the diathe∣sis has attained to a certain degree; while the local arises from some hurtful power, that produces a solution or viti∣ation of the texture of the part, without regard either to diathesis or degree: The general <HI>inflammation</HI> is brought on by the same hurtful exciting powers, which produce the general diathesis, only applied in a higher degree; and the same remedies remove both <HI>the diathesis and the in∣flammation:</HI> The local inflammation depends upon hurt∣ful powers, that only harm a part, and is removed by re∣medies that change the state of the part; <HI>but</HI> is not affected either by general hurtful powers, or general remedies. Ex∣amples of the universal are these inflammations, which ac∣company the gout, the putrid sore throat, the gangrenous sore throat, and that inflammation which produces sore eyes: The local inflammation will be illustrated by exam∣ples, to be produced in their proper places<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">as in the inflammation, that is produced by a wounding instrument when a person, previous to such an accident, is in health, and continues to be so after the accident. Or it may still be local, though a person is in bad health when it happens, but so, however, as that the general state of the health is understood to have no concern in it. A wound in a very tender part may induce disorder over the general system; but still all the symptoms can be traced to the wound, and not to the ordinary cause of general disease.</NOTE>: The gene∣ral inflammation is attended by debility over the whole system; which debility is only a sequel of the local, and not always. To remove the former the general method of cure<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">See par. LXXXVIII.</NOTE> is adapted; but the cure of the latter turns upon healing up the part. In this way, <HI>then,</HI> there are four <HI>sets of</HI> inflammation, two universal, a sthenic, and an as∣thenic, and two local; one of which is sthenic, and the o∣ther asthenic.

But they are diametrically opposite as shall be poin∣ted out when we come to the proper place for such distinctions.</NOTE> inflammation affects the brain or its mem∣branes, which<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">though strongly asserted. A professor in his lectures gives a case of a typhus fever, where, upon account of delirium and some other symp∣toms, thought to announce an inflammation in or near the brain, the patient was so freely bleeded, that the state of the pulse (which is said to have been, in his words, <Q>a pulsus vacivus, if ever there was such a pulse</Q>,) forbid any further bleeding. The patient was given up, and the extraordinary physicians withdrew, leaving the ordinary one of the family, only, about him. This gentleman, from some impression on his mind, began to think, that another bleeding might be tried with ad∣vantage. He bleeded him and the patient recovered. This is an ac∣count of a case that I pretend not to understand, and I believe it will be no less puzzling to my readers, and the more puzzling the more sense they have. It is, however brought as an example, that in a seeming exspiring debility, the highest degree of asthenic diathesis, there may be an universal sthenic debility, that requires bleeding.

<P>CCVII.

<P>CCVIII. The cause of general asthenic inflammation is also abundance of blood in the inflamed vessels, pro∣ducing the same effects <HI>in the inflamed portion</HI> as in the sthenic <HI>inflammation;</HI> and, notwithstanding of the penury of blood in every part of the vascular system besides, flow∣ing abundantly into the inflamed vessels, upon accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a greater atony and laxity in them, than in the others, di∣stending them and producing the phaenomena peculiar to any inflammation<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">These definitions, apply to all the four inflammations (par. CCVI.) with respect to the state of the inflamed vessels; their differences only depending upon the general state of all the rest of the vessels, which in the local, may be quite the healthy state of these, while, in sthenic gene∣ral inflammation, it is the sthenic, and in this the asthenic, diathesis, that are conjoined with the inflammatory state. Further, as their cause is influenced by these general circumstances, so also is their cure; the sthe∣nic and asthenic general inflammations requiring the remedies of the diathesis to which they respectively belong, and the local only the re∣medies suited to heal up the part.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCIX. As the indication of cure for the former is, to diminish the quantity of blood, which is the first cause of the struggle, and, thereby, to reduce the excessive excite∣ment to the degree that suits the healthy state, and the ex∣cessive contractions, which constitute the struggle, to the moderate ones, which are pleasant and agreeable to health<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See above, CXXXIV.</NOTE>: So</P>
<P>CCX. The indication of cure for the latter is, first,
<PB N="124" REF="022373_0138_0FB86AC28C51FDE0"/>

<P>CCXIII. The diffusible stimuli are so powerful in re∣moving the inflammation of the gout, that, sometimes, strong drink, undiluted, as wine, and spirits, or the latter diluted with water, as warm as can be borne, have in a few hours removed the most violent fit, and restored the use of the affected foot.

<P>CCXIV. The inflammation of the throat, in the gan∣grenous sore throat, is not, according to the common opinion, a primary affection; but, like every other general asthenic <HI>inflammation,</HI> depends upon the general diathesis, which, in this case, is manifestly asthenic, being a part or symptom of the diathesis, when that has attained a certain high degree.</P>
<P>This inflammation has nothing in common with the

CC). Such is the nature and progress of the small-pox, in passing from the sthenic in∣to the asthenic state, that is, from one disease into another of a most op∣posite nature.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCXVI. To throw light and illustration upon them, by comparing their respective methods of cure; it is to be observed that the cure; in the one case
<PB N="127" REF="022373_0141_0FB86AC6CE105780"/>
is quite different from that of the other<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">The cure of the distinct small-pox is the debilitating; that of the confluent, the stimulant plan. The cause of the former is sthenic dia∣thesis, that of the latter the asthenic, occasioned by indirect debility; which is a distinction unattended to in general, and with very bad effect upon the practice. For, when the confluent small-pox is established, the pustles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and signs of mortification coming on, the covering the pati∣ent with a single sheet is as common as in the distinct small pox.</NOTE>. The remedies of the distinct small-pox, and of its accom∣panying eruption, are cold, and whatever, by evacuation or otherwise, debilitates. The remedies of the confluent disease, as well as of its accompanying eruption, are heat, remaining within the indirectly debilitating degree, and all the powers, which stimulate as quickly, and as power∣fully as possible, and consequently, the most diffusible.</P>
<P>CCXVII. They differ besides in this, that all the hurt∣ful powers in the distinct case are sthenic; all in the con∣fluent asthenic. And this difference equally applies to both diseases, and both eruptions.</P>
<P>CCXVIII. And as the sthenic or distinct pustles have a direct tendency <HI>to produce</HI> asthenic inflammation, and sthenic eruption; so the tendency of the asthenic or confluent, is <HI>as</HI> directly to gangrene, sphacelus, and death.</P>
<P>CCXIX. The boils, carbuncles, and buboes, which often accompany the plague and sometimes the typhus fever<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See above, the note (<HI>c</HI>), under par. CCVII.</NOTE> arise from a contagious matter, taken into the body, and then detained with the perspiratory fluid, under the cuticle, and in the glands. The case of the detention, and, there∣fore, of this eruption, is a total cessation of motion in the extreme arteries, especially the glands and perspiratory ter∣minations, upon acount of the universal debility, and the very great langour of the heart and arteries. That this is the case, is proved by their being no eruption during the period of predisposition, when some vigour still remains;
<PB N="128" REF="022373_0142_0FB86AC9E8507AF8"/>
and, therefore, the perspiration goes on in a certain degree; none in <HI>the cases of</HI> sudden death from the violence of the disease; neither eruption nor disease in all the cases, whether these are early prevented by the use of the more powerful stimulants; by the disease being always gentle, and the eruption always sparing, in pro∣portion to the proper management of the stimulant plant of cure. For, whether the suppression of perspiration be the consequences of a very great degree of sthenic diathesis, or of an equal degree of sthenic as in the present case; all the foreign matter, that should be thrown out of the system along with the perspirable, is, together with it, detained, and so detained below the cuticle, by stagnating, and ac∣quiring a more acrid nature, it produces local inflammati∣on, either of a sthenic or asthenic nature, in proportion to the different nature of each, or rather of the habit of the body.</P>

In the same manner is that eruption which diversifies the skin in the gangrenous sore throat to be ex∣plained; as well as another, which supervenes upon that state of the small-pox, which by reason of the debility <HI>of the system,</HI> would otherwise turn out well; but if the new e∣ruption be not opposed by the most powerful stimuli, is sure to end in death.

If this practice is executed, the recovery is both certain and quick; <HI>but,</HI> if it be <HI>neglected,</HI> or if a contrary plan of cure be set on foot, death is inevitable<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">It is certain, that the safe conduct of the small-pox depends upon debilitating the habit which is to receive the infection; and it is as lit∣tle doubtful that we may carry that operation a great way, by lowering the diet, purging the belly, and applying intense cold to the surface, and, by all means, guarding against all alternation with heat. By this means the phlogistic diathesis, chiefly arising from the ordinary powers, and in part, as it would seem, from the contagious matter, is prevented or removed; the great flow of the fluids to the surface checked; and the diameters of the perspiratory, as well as of all the other vessels, kept open and patulous. But it had been long a question with me, whether this debilitating operation might not be carried to far. If it be certain, as it is, that extreme debility suppresses perspiration, surely the process pushed near to that degree must endanger that event. This phaenome∣non happening to my child, solved the doubt that I had not yet decided, and it seemed to be in perfect conformity to the principles of this doctrine, to understand, that, as this child had been formerly weak, and, perhaps, still retained some degree of that state, the further weakening him by the preparatory management, for the better regulating this disease, had been carried too far. A surgeon happened to be by when the child was un∣der examination; I asked him if he had ever seen such a case, for I had neither seen, nor heard, nor read, any thing like it. His answer was, that he had seen three, and all of them fatal. I knew how that would happen, that is, that they would continue the debilitating practice they had been following. On the contrary, I ordered the child spirit and wa∣ter, and a little of an opiate, then restored the meals that had been ta∣ken from him, and brought him about to his perfect health (for the small-pox gave no trouble) in twelve or sixteen hours.</NOTE>.</P>

CCXXI. Heat is not peculiar to sthenic pyrexiae<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Pyrexia is the word for sthenic diseases affecting the pulse, called febrile, or fevers, very improperly, while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erm fever is reserved for the high asthenic diseases that have been confounded with the pyrexiae.</NOTE>, but belongs also to other diseases of the same stamp. Nor is it so confined to those, as not also to arise in all the degrees of predisposition to those diseases, and in proportion to each degree<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">That heat takes place in predisposition, is a matter of daily obser∣vation. Thus, when a person has no other symptom of disease, it is of∣ten remarked, sometimes by himself, sometimes by another, who may have happened to feel his hands, that he is certainly not quite well as his hands are hot. When this heat happens, either in the hands or feet, without any cause to account for it consistently with health, it is a sure prelude of disease, that is, a sure mark of a considerable predisposition to to discase: and the kind of disease, of which it is the harbinger, is of∣tener asthenic than sthenic.</NOTE>. But the matter does not end here. The same heat distinguishes all asthenic diseases, whether fe∣brile, which is a distinction without any good meaning, or not <HI>febrile,</HI> and also the predispositions to them all, and <HI>that</HI> in proportion to the degree of debility. There is not a more certain mark of a departing disease, whether sthe∣nic or asthenic, that <HI>a return of</HI> that temperature, which is commonly called cool, to distinguish it from morbid heat.</P>
<P>CCXXII. The heat is then only natural, when neither diathesis is present. From that <HI>point</HI> it encreases, through all the degrees of encreased excitement, till indirect debi∣lity, from excess of stimulus, is established; and it en∣creases in proportion to the degree of excitement, rendering the perspiratory vessels always less and less patulous. It also encreases through all the degrees of diminished ex∣citement
<PB N="131" REF="022373_0145_0FB86AD14096BDD8"/>
to certain boundaries, which are fixed by a cause by-and-by to be explained, <HI>and encreases</HI> in proportion to the degree of decreasing excitement, though the latter all along renders the perspiratory vessels more patulous; and, thereby, among other effects, diminishes the motion, both of all the vessels, and particularly of the perspiratory.</P>
<P>CCXXIII. When the heat has now been the greatest it can be, and the debility encreased in proportion, at last in the extremities, and afterwards gradually in the rest of the body, cold, which is always a bad sign, succeeds to it. In the progress of the debility motion begins to be very languid, first in the extreme vessels of the extremities of the limbs, and then to be destroyed altogether. Hence, as heat, whether in due proportion, or in excess, depends upon the motion of the blood and other fluids, being per∣formed in due proportion, in excess, or to a certain extent, in a deficient degree; if, therefore, the heat is either no∣thing, or next to nothing, as in the present case, the effect, together with the cause, by an universal law in nature, ceases. The same thing happens in both extremes of ex∣citability, that is, of excessive abundance in direct, and of nearly a cessation of it, in indirect debility; and so much more <HI>readily will this happen,</HI> because, whatever be its source, debility is always the same.</P>
<P>CCXXIV. Because the excitement in sthenic diseases is for the most part much and equally encreased over the whole body; the heat, on that account, is also equally diffused over the whole. From which fact no cases are excepted, but those, in which, in certain parts, as the stomach, under a strong disposition to vomiting, and, therefore in danger of falling into indirect debility, indi∣rect debility either actually takes place, from the disease proceeding with an excessive force of stimulus; or direct debility comes on, when the debilitating plan of cure has been pushed beyond the rule. But, so long as the sthenic
<PB N="132" REF="022373_0146_0FB86AD2C6B940A0"/>
diathesis is vigorous, and supports a high force of excite∣ment the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will almost always be equal.</P>
<P>CCXXV. The same thing happens in moderate de∣bility. Accordingly, through the whole course of predis∣position, and in those diseases, where the matter has not gone so far as almost a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cessation of motion, the heat is pretty equal. The effect of cessation of motion has been explained<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See above, CCXXIII.</NOTE>, But, before that happens, if any ine∣quality of heat occurs in diseases of moderate debility, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> frequently the case in the hands and feet; the reason of that is, that a greater degree of debility as in cold, la∣bour, and sweat from these, or any other source, and that sweat cold and clammy, has been applied to those parts, than to others. Not only in the gout, but also in other affections both of direct and indirect debility, a burning heat, chiefly distressing to the soles of the feet, torments the patient, especially in walking. That that arises from debility, checking perspiration, is proved by fatigue, cold, and other debilitating powers proving hurtful to it; and heat, rest, and other stimulant powers, giving it ease.</P>
<P>CCXXVI. It remains now, that it be explained, how too great excitement, in high sthenic diseases, impairs some functions, but never, by debilitating operation; and how too small an excitement in violent asthenic diseases, gives an appearance of encreasing some functions, but always a false one.</P>
<P>CCXXVII. If, in peripneumony, sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocha<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">or the inflammatory fever.</NOTE>, and violent rheumatism, the voluntary motion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are impaired, <HI>and</HI> to such a degree, that a person can neither use his hands nor his feet, more than a paralytic person; that that is not owing to debility, that is, diminished excitement whether directly or indirectly<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">When the excitement is at 40 all the functions are performed in the best and completest manner. Above that there is more force through all the steps of predisposition, but with less durability and steadiness; which is exemplified by the comparison of hard labourers, who at the same time are well supported, and gentlemen, who live well, without using a proportionable degree of labour or exercise to prevent a luxuriant state of vigour. When two such persons are subjected to a comparative trial of their vigour in any exertion, the former will be found to go through the exertion with more steadiness, and to hold out longer and better than the other; even though his first efforts may have been inferior in force to those of his antagonist. And the reason is evident; a moderate and proper degree of vigour, will bear an addition of stimulant operation longer than a higher degree of it approaching to morbid state; because the distance of the excitement from indirect debility, which puts an end to excitement, is greater in the former than in the latter case. The dif∣ference in the well-supported labourer is 30 before he can reach an en∣crease that leads up to 70; whereas that of the gentleman is perhaps not more than 20. The exertion in the struggle adds stimulus; which will be better borne by him who has least and yet enough, than by him who has more, but of a superfluous degree, and more liable to run into the extreme of a cessation of excitement. The effect of the exertion in the labourer will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> carry him soon up, by its stimulant operation, to the degree of excitement where the gentleman began, suppose that to be 50, and perhaps by and by to 60. But the same stimulus of exertion in the gentleman will have the effect of first mounting up to 60, and by and by to 70, where the excitement begins to cease.</NOTE>, is evident from this double proof;
<PB N="133" REF="022373_0147_0FB86AD44F2E3330"/>

The teeth also, from the affection occupying the mus∣cles of the under jaw, are kept immoveably locked, and hence the name of lock-jaw. Besides the affection of the muscles, that has been mention∣ed, there is scarce one muscle in the whole body, free from one degree or other of the affection. Further, there is a most painful feeling over all, but especially in the parts most affected. This disease sometimes happens in cold countries, such as this, in consequence of a wound in any sensible part, or when small bones, as the ossa spongiosa, are brui∣sed, crashed and dashed into the softer parts. The part of it called lock-jaw is frequently a symptom in fevers. But the disease is more frequent in warmer countries than this, as in the south of Europe, where the ex∣cess of heat is liable to run into indirect debility. It is most frequent of all in the Torrid Zone, where indirect debility is the most constant at∣tendant on heat. As a violent and permanent contraction of the muscles was the most striking symptom of it, and systematic physicians supposed every such contraction the effect of an encrease of excitement, or, to use their own words, an encreased influx of the nervous fluid or nervous power into the parts affected; consequently their indication of cure was to relax the rigid contracted parts. Hence no bounds were set to their emolient relaxing measures. Such were bleeding, other evacuations, and warm bathing. But experience soon taught, that all these encreased, instead of removing the disease. Of late opium, because it was thought a sedative, was tried. The trial succeeded. But immense quantities of that medicine were found necessary to effect the complete cure. Lauda∣num used to be thrown in without measure, or any other rule, but to give it on till the disease ceased.</NOTE>, and in many spasms of other parts;

What reason would a podagric have to thank any one, who should convert the gout in him upon any violent attack, into a fatal dropsy? That sort of treatment is not curing a disease but en∣creasing it, and even that to death. The convulsive symptoms of an asthenic may pass away; but the asthenic remains. You may cease to call it epilepsy; but dropsy still shows that the cause of the disease re∣mains, nay is prodigiously encreased. This fatal mistake of an encrease of the disease upon the whole, for the cure of an inferior degree of it, proceeds from an improper use of directly debilitating powers in place of the proper stimulant ones. But there are cases, where the last, by be∣ing carried too far, produce the same fatal mistake. This in peripneu∣mony, to get rid of the hard pulse, and the acute pungent pain (see a∣bove, CLXXIV. and the notes), the bleedings are carried so far as to produce a fatal hydrothorax, or dropsy of the chest.</NOTE>.</P>

The healthy and vigorous state of motion consists not in the degree of contraction, but within certain degree of that, in the well proportioned alternation between contraction and relaxation; of which we have proof indisputa∣ble in this mode of motion being best performed in that middle state of vigour, that intervenes betwixt the extreme of the healthy, or moderate∣ly encreased vigour, and the other extreme of direct and indirect debi∣lity. The encrease of vigour and excitement keep pace to a certain ex∣tent, even through some degrees of morbid excess of the latter: but a period, and that short of indirect debility, arrives, as in peripneumony, where the excitement is encreased beyond the healthy state, and must be reduced in order to restore the due healthy vigour. There are other ca∣ses, as that of mania, or sthenic insanity, where the conjoined encrease of vigour and excitement will still go further. But in every case the en∣crease of vigour, still judging of it from its effects in the healthy state, ceases before that of excitement; and, perhaps, we may make a step to∣wards finding the boundary, by observing, that the greater the sum total of excess of exciting power is, the sooner does the point arrive, beyond which the vigour does not proceed. In peripneumony it ceases at a cer∣tain period of the disease, where the salutary effect of bleeding and other debilitating means shows that the encrease of excitement is still going on. But here the sum total of excitement, considering the state of all the other functions, is greater than in mania, where the function chiefly encreased in vigour is only that of voluntary motion, while all the functions of in∣voluntary motion are very little affected. From this investigation we can clearly discern, that every encrease of excitement leads to a morbid encrease of vigour, and that there is, somewhere or other, a point in the scale of encreasing excitement, and below the point of indirect debility, where the vigour is no further encreased; and this inference arises with respect to the practice, that we should be very observant of both facts, as pointing out a very material distinction in the indications of cure; that in indirect debility being to stimulate, while that at the cessation of vigour is to continue to debilitate till the sum total of excessive vigour be redu∣ced to the proper and healthy. The inability to the performance of motion in peripneumony is an instance of the latter; that of the conver∣sion of the same disease from excess of debilitating cure is an instance of the former.</NOTE></P>

For a full account of it see the Preface to the Observations on the Principles of the old Systems of Physic, from page 19 to page 58.

They have hitherto been supposed to depend upon sthenic, what they call phlogistic diathesis, and the particular discharge to be sup∣ported by an activity, an effort, what they call a molimen haemorrhagi∣cum, in the vessels pouring out the blood and the parts of the vessels im∣mediately behind. Their continuance was accounted for upon the sup∣position of there being an over-proportion of blood in the system, or what is commonly called a plethora; that they are all asthenic diseases, de∣pending upon relaxation and atony both of all the rest of the vas∣cular system, and particularly of the bleeding vessels. (See above, CXXXIV-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) and, instead of a plethora, there is a penury of blood; all which is proved by the phenomena during the predisposition, when little food is taken in, and less, upon account of the weakness of the di∣gestive organs, is digested; these circumstances are encreased after the arrival of the disease.

That they depend
<PB N="143" REF="022373_0157_0FB86AEED9580D68"/>
upon debility, is proved by the failure of the cure just now mentioned, and by the great success of the stimulant plan. The true cause of bleeding discharge is not plethora, which cannot happen in the case of persons ill nourished, in water drinking, and under the application of other hurt∣ful powers, that equally destroy the tone and density of the vessels<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot"> See above, CXXIV. and x.</NOTE> For as food is nearly the only material, from which blood is formed; how, when it is withheld, in the absence of the cause, can the effect remain? and, if, upon account of the debilitating effect of other hurtful powers, any food that is taken is not digested how can there be an over∣proportion, and not a manifest scantiness of blood? But <HI>it may be alledged, that</HI> loss of blood, and every sort of de∣bilitating power, diminish perspiration, and that from that <HI>circumstance</HI> the quantity of blood is encreased.

On the contrary, nothing has been more common, than to talk of the functions as operating in a great measure, each from a cause existing within itself, or but slightly and arbitrarily connected with some other. This false notion was carried to its most ridiculous pitch in the doctrine of sympathy, and not rendered much more decent, after the word consent of parts came to be substituted in its place. Thus, the common expressions were the sympathy or consent of the stomach with the head, of the stomach with the face, of the stomach with the external surface, of the latter with the internal, and particularly with the intestines, of the excretions with each other, of the feet with the kidneys, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth. It was never dreamed, that there was one over∣ruling principle throughout upon which all the functions depended. The stomach, for instance, cannot be strong while the perspiratory or∣gans are weak, and therefore take in and digest too much while they cannot throw out their fluid.</NOTE> then after the serous part has been separated from the red, will it,
<PB N="144" REF="022373_0158_0FB86AF06A96D118"/>
if detained and thrown back into the blood, again become blood? If these questions, to which there is no possibility of returning any answer, should seem in any degree ambi∣guous; are we to believe that one part of the body is in such a state of vigour, as to produce an over proportion of blood, and another in so languid a state, as not to be able to carry off by the due outlets its corrupted matter? And must we, <HI>giving up our fundamental principle after so complete an establishment of it,</HI> allow, that the excitability over the whole body is not the same uniform, undivided property over all the system; that the powers acting upon it are not the same, finally that matter can be created out of no∣thing<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">It has been proved in the IVth chapter, Part. I. that the excita∣bility is one uniform, undivided property over all, and that, in whate∣ver part of its seat it is acted upon, that action extends instantaneously o∣ver all; that though some parts, differently upon different occasions, may be more acted upon than any other, equal in size and nervous im∣portance, that that is only in so insignificant a proportion as to have no effect in constituting an inequality of action in the system. Again the force of the powers that act is a given force, being either weak, in due proportion, or excessive, or weak again from ultimate excess. Their effect then upon the system, which receives their action in every degree in which it is communicated, and that with the utmost exactness, must al∣ways be the same, that is, either direct debility, health, sthenic diathesis or indirect debility. To apply this to the present case, the stomach can∣not be healthy, or under a predisposition to sthenic state, and there by take in and digest, with the help of the other digestive organs, too much of the matter, from which blood is made; while the perspiratory ves∣sels are too weak to perform their function of throwing off their excre∣mentitious matter. On the contrary, the state of the stomach must run through the whole living system. If it can perform its functions pro∣perly, or in whatever degree it performs it, all the other organs of di∣gestion, the upper part of the intestines, biliary vessels, the lacteals, the veins betwixt their common trunk and the heart, the heart through all its cavities, the whole arterial system, and the colourless terminations of that system, whether exhalant of glandular, and the excretory orifices of these, the inhalants, and all the venous blood returned by the arteries; lastly, all the excretories upon the external and internal surface, all these will perform their functions in the same degree as the stomach whether properly or imperfectly. To promote the most perfect health all the exciting powers must be applied, each in its due proportion. And the want of any one or more many make some odds, which is insignificant to this point. If a person has not had his usual exercise a chearful glass will prepare him for sleep. For want of the same exercise the appetite will be impaired, but so is the function of perspiration. Too much exercise under heat will impair the appetite, but it also impairs the perspiration after a person gets into a state of rest. In short, any slight inequality from want of any one or more stimuli can be made up by others. See above, par. XLI.</NOTE>? It is in vain to talk of the fattening of chickens
<PB N="145" REF="022373_0159_0FB86AF1DB220B80"/>
and cattle by keeping them from exercise and in a state of rest. The condition of health and disease is very different. In the former there is a certain latitude of the strength of the stomach; in the latter, and especially when debility is the cause, there is a prostration of strength. In fine, it is an universal and constant effect of all debility, to produce a deficiency of the fluids in the internal parts of the system with a relaxation of the vessels over all, especially about their excretory terminations, and a discharge of the fluids by some out-lets. The death, that happens, during the time of an entertainment, is not to be imputed to an over proportion of blood, which cannot happen in so short a space of time. The drink has no effect in filling the vessels. Nor do any persons, but those who are under direct or indirect debility, meet with such an end, never those, who have an over-proportion of blood; which, as the ap∣petite is gone, and the digestive powers destroyed, cannot be produced. In what diseases was it that plethora was supposed to take place? Not in those, in which the diges∣tive organs, and those that produce blood, in fine, in which the whole system, are in a state of vigour, where the appe∣tite is very keen, and the digestion most perfectly perfor∣med, and the digested matter most completely converted in
<PB N="146" REF="022373_0160_0FB86AF47AEC1B40"/>
to blood; but in those, in which upon account of the de∣bility propagated over the whole body, all the functions are in a state of langour, and in which the only matter, suited to make blood, is either not applied, or not assimi∣lated. In this way, the gout, apoplexy, epilepsy, palsy, asthma and hysteria, the indigestions of persons, who have been formerly addicted to luxury, in since, those very disea∣ses, which make our present subject, the hemorrhages, as they are called and falsly defined by that term, lastly; the far greatest part of asthenic diseases, have been thought, at all times and by all physicians, to depend upon plethora with vigour, or plethora with mobility. But in fact and truth that both all the rest of those diseases, and those accompani∣ed with bleeding discharge, depend upon a penury of blood and other debilitating powers is proved, by the constant failure of the antisthenic plan of cure to the great disgrace of the profession, and by the incredible success of the new stimulant plan. And with respect to the bleeding dischar∣ges, consider the persons, affected with them in the hurt∣ful powers, that precede them, and in the symptoms <HI>that attend them.</HI> During the whole period of predisposition, quite delicate and weakly, they have very little appetite for food, and take very little, and what they take, is not di∣gested, and often rejected by vomiting. In their weak state they are not supported by the stimulant <HI>operation</HI> of corporeal, or mental exercise, nor by that of the animal spirits, which are quite puny and dejected, nor by that of pure air <HI>which they are not able to go out to take,</HI> nor by that of agreeable sensation, nor by that of strong drink, which, from the misleading advice of their physicians, they look upon as poison, nor by that of the distention of the vessels, which are not sufficiently filled with blood, nor by that of the secretory small vessels, upon account of their stuggish motion, and stagnation of their degenerated fluids every where, and the direct debility constantly arising from that.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="022373_0161_0FB86AFA5A9EB280"/>
What sort of pulse have they? Such, as it is in all diseases of manifest debility, for instance, fevers, (in which last, which is surprising their favourite plethora, was seldom suspected by them), small, weak and very quick and almost empty. Upon the whole, what like are their intellectual functions, those of passion and emotion, and their corporeal functi∣ons, either in sense, or motion whether of the voluntary or involuntary kind? All weak, all frail, all such, as show that they have not a third part of life to support them. What, on the contrary, is the state of those, who abound in blood, and yet never experience discharges of it? They are strong and full of vigour in all their functions, with redness of countenance, sparkling eyes, strong, hard and moderately frequent pulse. Their appetite for food is keen, the quantity they take is great and well digested. As those persons, may experience droopings of blood of no con∣sequence, and yet not often so they fall into no dis∣charges of blood. And it is in perfect consistency with all that has been said, <HI>to add,</HI> that the various forms of strong drink, and these particularly, which are the strongest, such as are called spirits, are surprisingly successful remedies of bleeding discharges, in spite of every thing that has hitherto been thought to the con∣trary, in spite of rooted prejudices: But the preparati∣ons of opium<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Opium, though much used in the cure of certain symptoms of dis∣eases, was never understood by those physicians, who, in books and lec∣tures assumed to themselves the province of directing the profession of physic. Every property they assigned to it was the reverse of the truth. Instead of allowing it to be the strongest stimulant in nature, they made it a sedative; and, though they found great difficulty in finding a single sedative more, to help to make out their catalogue of a class of such bo∣dies in nature, they were confident that it was one (see above, CCXXX. and the notes).

What is more dissimilar than the va∣rious phoenomena of fevers of the intermittent kind through all their degrees of intermitting and remitting and those of the more continued kind? And yet they all arise from causes highly debilitating, and are effectually removed by remedies equal in their degree of stimulus. In one word, to show the insignificancy of the distinction of diseases into febrile and non-febrile, and, when the degree of debility constituting the cause in. both, is considered and compared; is there any reason for separating the high drop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the high dysentery, and sinking cholera from their place betwixt inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ittent and remittent fevers and the most con∣tinued kind?

The cure of it, however, in all the cases that depend upon direct debility, is by no means difficult<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">I have experienced such a case more than once, and have seen and treated it in great numbers. It is sometimes a part of the concourse of symptoms, that form that asthenic case of disease, which is commonly called fever. A gentleman, under or about the thirtieth year of his age, had been ten days in a typhus fever, occasioned by extreme cold, suc∣ceeding to the debilitating effects left upon his habit by too great mode∣ration in his diet, and, certainly, not a good choice of the different arti∣cles of it. To aid the debilitating effects arising from these, he had ex∣perienced all the extremes of the heat and fatigue, that fall to a soldier's lot, in very warm countries. He was, over and above, of a small size, slender and emaciated. He had also, from his infancy, been affected with a short cough, sometimes dry, and sometimes with a little expecto∣ration. During the course of his cure, he had been more than once bleeded, though his disease had ushered itself in by a great profusion of bleeding, which suddenly took him as he was on a journey in a cold day of about 44 miles in a carriage. He was vomitted, purged, blistered prodigiously, and glistered. The whole force of the old plan of cure was exhausted upon him, and he so exhausted by it, as to be given up for an incurable of two diseases, a bad fever and rotten lungs. His face was hippocratic, he had the dead rattle, and his cough and expectoration were assiduous. By the stimulant new plan of cure he was put out of danger in ten days, and set upon his feet in as many more.</NOTE>, unless the disease has proceeded beyond the boundary <HI>of admitting a cure,</HI> and life is now approaching to its end.

such, as to produce a complete restoration of health, <HI>and thereby to</HI> leave not the least suspicion, of there being any local affection in the lungs, which is so much the object both of the faith and fear of physicians<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">A description of this disease, in which the lungs are supposed to be affected with ulcers or tubercles, has been given in the note under this paragraph at (<HI>p</HI>). But, as the subject is both as new and interest∣ing as any in this work, it may be proper to give a further illustration of it by the exposition of another set of facts. Both in persons liable to the gout, and other asthenic diseases, sometimes of direct and at other times of indirect debility, and especially in those who have been much exposed to cold, without the debilitating effect of the cold being over∣come (vide par. CXXII), by an alternation with, or succession of, heat, and in very many old people, especially among the poorer sort, who have been, and naturally are, much exposed to various debilitating powers, there is often, especially in winter, a very great cough and ex∣pectoration. This sometimes goes to such a height as to give suspicion of the affection of the lungs just now spoken of. But the completeness of its cure, which when it arises from indirect debility, is effected by the use of animal food, avoiding vegetable, and fish, and by good wine and diluted spirits in moderate proportion at a time, but frequently re∣peated, avoiding claret and other French wines and all four and all beer-drink, unless perhaps a little warm porter in cold weather, and a very moderate use of diffusible stimuli, keeping the feet and the body in general moderately warm; shows sufficiently, that there had been no local affection in the lungs. When the debility of the disease is of the in∣direct kind, in which the cure is more difficult, there is, still, as little reason to be apprehensive of the pulmonary or any other local affection. For the cure of it also proves the contrary. In it the means of cure are to change the forms of stimulus, and to proceed from the use of the stronger to that of the weaker, till at length the patient can do without much of the very strong ones. (See above, par. XCIX. and those that follow). When the disease cannot be overcome in that way, the excitability must be understood to be worn out, and life come to its end; but still from general debility, not local disease. For, if ever any lo∣cal affection does appear, it is always the last effect, not the primary cause. In this way I lost two gentlemen, after having been able to sup∣port them for many weeks, when the prognosis upon the common prac∣tice did not allow them as many hours. The cause of their indirect de∣bility had been hard drinking. But even in those, who die of a con∣firmed consumption, there is not often reason for the suspicion of tuber∣cles in the lungs. Their bodies have been opened after death and the lungs sound quite sound. And in the dissections, where the tubercles have been found, still they were only an effect.</NOTE></P>

<P>CCXXXVIII. Such is the nature of the excitability, of animals, that it can neither be deficient nor over-abun∣dant,

without detriment? a deficiency producing indirect, and a superabundance, direct debility. And, as any ex∣citing power, carried beyond its boundary<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See par. XXVIII.</NOTE>, can pro∣duce the former, and the with holding of any, give oc∣casion to the latter<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See par. XXXVIII.</NOTE>; so the same proposition holds good of the excessive or too sparing use of several of them, or of them all<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">This is completely illustrated through the whole first chapter of the second part, from par. CXI. to par. CLXVII. inclusive. Nay, the proposition is constantly alluded to through the whole that has yet been said, and will be in what remains to be said.</NOTE>. Sleep, then, is the effect of the actions of the day, at first giving always more and more excitement, but less and less <HI>in proportion to the continuance of their operation</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See par. XXXVI.</NOTE>, but in such sort as always to add some <HI>excitement,</HI> till the matter at <HI>last</HI> comes to a point, where the degree of ex∣citement, necessary to constitute the waking state, no lon∣ger exists. Of this we have the most certain proof in every day's experience, and in the confirmation of it, which the complete induction of the effects of all the ex∣citing powers affords.<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">To illustrate this, let us take the exciting powers one by one, and begin with wine. When a person is insufficiently excited with respect to that stimulus, and rises not, suppose, above 30° in his excitement, a glass carries him up 2°, another 2° more, and so forth, till after five glasses, and their effect in carrying him up to 40°, he finds himself well and vigorous in all his functions. But, still, we are not so flimsily made, as not to bear a little of what is either too much or too little. Suppose him then to take five glasses more, and, consequently, to be raised to 50°, or 10° above the standard. As his spirits, his intellectual, and all his other, functions, were low, while his excitement remained below 40°, so they are all proportionably exalted by the time that his excite∣ment is elevated to 50°. Let him still go on, and his intellectual func∣tion will rise still higher; he will now display the full extent of his ge∣nius: his passions and emotions, of whatever kind, will rise in the same proportion; he will, in one word, be an example of the effects of Alex∣ander's feast. Suppose, to bring him to all this he has swallowed, be∣sides those he had before, other five glasses. Let him go on, till he has taken five glasses more, and we shall see the effect: In the course of time, employed in taking these, he gradually falls off in his spirits, in his intellectual, and in his corporeal, functions; his tongue, his feet, his eyes, his memory, his judgment, all, fail him; he, at last, becomes drow∣sy, and then falls fast a-sleep. The same is the progress of excitement as it arises from labour or exercise through the day, whether of mind or body. The same is the effect of the stimulus of eating, especially nou∣rishing stimulant things, and in great plenty. Before dinner, the occu∣pations of the former part of the day, are not yet sufficient to prepare one for sleep; which, however, after a heavy dinner, will, unless the in∣terference of some other stimulus prevent it, very readily happen to most people, especially to those, whose frailty, from age or any other cause, renders them more liable to be fatigued by the past operations of the day than others. The younger and more vigorous will be able to hold out to the end of the day; when they too, after having undergone the degree of stimulus necessary to give that waste of excitability that disposes to sleep, will be overcome by it. The very flow of the blood in the vessels, and the exercise of the involuntary motions, that keep it up, tend at last to the same effect. The same thing applies to the motion constantly going on in the stomach and intestines, as well as the motions that occur in all the secretory and excretory small vessels. Light, stimu∣lating the eyes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound, the ears, and the several substances that act upon the organs of the other three senses, all, tend, by wasting the ex∣citability, to wear down the excitement to that point in the scale where sleep commences. And the process, in every case, is, first a low, then a higher and higher, then the highest, vigour of all the functions; which, again, gradually falls till its termination in sleep. We have, therefore, after viewing their effects singly, to suppose them, in one degree or in another, united, and sleep the finishing effect of their united operations,</NOTE>.</P>

Thus, heat not ultimately excessive, or reduced, by cold, from that excess to its stimulant degree<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See above, par.

<P>Μ. Of the directly debilitating powers, which produce the same effect, the want, or sparing application, of the powers, which, by a due degree of stimulus, produce sleep, will surprise into a bad kind of it; accordingly, when a person is in that state, that he wants excitement in order to be in health, the defect of light, of sound, and of the various contacts <HI>of the bodies</HI> that excite the other senses, the defect of both sets of motions, the voluntary and involuntary, as well as of the exercise of the mind, of the exercise of passion, of heat, acting in its stimulant degree, and too long continued sleep itself, all these produce hurt∣ful sleep<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Coma, or an insuperable disposition to sleep, is most commonly owing to the want of most of the stimuli mentioned in the text, as that of food, of wine, at least in the ordinary practice of cure, of good animal spirits, of the power of thinking in a pleasant exciting train, of a due quantity of blood in the vessels, of pure open air, of corporeal exercise, and of the absence of certain stimuli, that otherwise irritate in the wea∣kened state, and produce watchfulness.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>CCXXXIX. On the contrary, sound watching is the effect of the suspence of the same diurnal actions during the period of sleep, taking off more and more excitement, most a first, and less and less after, but always adding to the sum of diminution of excitement, and accumulation of excitability; that is, always continuing to take off sti∣mulus, till the matter comes to the degree of diminished

excitement, and encreasing excitability necessary to the watching state.

<P>CCXL. As debility, therefore, whether indirect or di∣rect, or in part a mixture <HI>of both</HI><NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See par.

proper or morbid vigilance. The only salutary sleep is that which is produced by a proper degree of excitement, occasioned by a proper action of the exciting powers upon the excitability; all the extremes of either excessive sleep, or excessive vigilance, are either so many tendencies to disease, or actual disease<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Too much, or too long continued, sleep, is hurtful, because it im∣plies a suspension of that excitement, to which proper health and due vi∣gour is owing, it is, consequently, a state of direct debility.

From the former arise most of the complaints of the rich and indolent; from the latter, many of the diseases of the poor and laborious. As the action of the ex∣citing powers should be adapted to the strength, a little indulgence in sleep is the safest extreme to the weak, as in the case of children, and persons labouring under debility.</NOTE></P>

In this great exertion I was sustained by a great stimulus, high animal spirits, and love.

CCXLI. As the effect of both indirect and direct de∣bility is sometimes sleep, sometimes watching, both <HI>of them</HI> unsound, both hurtful; so the cause of bad sleep is either <HI>sort of</HI> debility; without a stimulus acting upon the system in a weakened state, and, thereby, throwing the system in∣to a state of disturbance. The same debility of either kind, with such a stimulus, produces the morbid watch∣ing; in which case it is a small stimulus that acts as an irritating power<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Volumes have been filled with the doctrine of irritation as a cause of morbid state, and the indications of cure and remedies to remove it have been equally tedious and laboured. In sthenic diseases, phlogistic diathesis, instead of plethora and vigour (for the belief in which two last there might have been some foundation in that form of diseases, see above from CXXXI. to CXXXIV.) has been the universal pathology; and bleeding, other evacuations, and cold, the universal idea, or, as it is called, indication of cure; and while they thought of no other method or means of cure for the asthenic form of diseases, the pathology, applied to them, was plethora with vigour or with mobility in other cases, and, in the febrile, irritation. By irritation they explained the startings of the tendons, the restlessness, the frequency of the pulse, the typhoma∣nia or constant working, of so frequent occurrence and so noted a symp∣tom in those diseases. But as we have proved, that the reverse of ple∣thora and vigour is the true state of the system in every disease of debi∣lity; so we assert with the same solidity of argument, and the same weight of proof, that irritation, as being considered, either as the cause of morbid watchfulness or of any other symptom, is nothing that re∣requires either evacuant, or any other debilitating remedies, to remove it. It is merely a weakened state of the system, thrown into flutterings from the slightest exertion of the ordinary functions, as when a person falls into tremors from noise, or into a sweat from walking a step or two.</NOTE>.</P>

It is evident, that, to bring on salutary watch∣ing on the one hand, or salutary sleep on the other, or to convert both into salutary sleep, if that be required by the circumstances, the deficient degree of stimulus must be administered; that is five degrees to bring up the excitement from 10 to 15 degrees, and as many for the purpose of renewing the worn-out excitement by means of a new exciting power which may still find a portion of excitability to act upon, or to re∣move certain stimuli, which, however slight and mild, are fatiguing and disturbing to the system in its weakened state. Accordingly in fever, when the patient, amidst every sort of directly debilitating powers, had, besides, wanted sleep for ten days, a small portion of an opiate given him every quarter of an hour, in 3 hours time laid him asleep, which, in spite of an urgent cough and profuse expectoration, lasted for 16 hours, and was followed by the most surprising relief. The continuance of this practice, with only an encrease of the doses in proportion as the abundant excitability was gradually worn off, and alternating them with wine and beef soup, in ten days removed all danger. A child of three months had had no sound sleep for ten days, but had cried night and day from a complaint in his belly, which the ordinary practitioners would have called an obstruction in the mesenteric glands. A large dose of the tinctura thebaica, for the patient's age, was administered, which laid him in a profound sleep, that continued near 36 hours, and at once re∣moved the disease. Numberless are the cases of a kind similar to this where the morbid watchfulness was partly from direct, partly from indi∣rect debility, that have been constantly removed by the same practice. A child of 7 years of age, in a fever of great direct debility, in consequence of a most rapid growth happening during the disease, which was not completely removed till near the end of seven weeks, after having been under the disease near a fortnight, was affected with the most constant disposition to sleep, so sound that no noise or shaking of his body could awaken him. The administration of the opiate repeated in small doses till the effect took place, kept him awake. Some time after, in the course of the same lingering disease, when he had not yet acquired any permanent strength, but was only better supported by the diffusible and other stimuli, than he had been till I was called in, his predominant symptom came to be great watchfulness, which was partly the effect of a certain, though not a great, degree of excitement that the tincture and other cordial powers had given him. It, however, induced too great a degree of indirectly debilitating exertion for his still very weak state, and it, therefore, became necessary to give him an addition of ex∣citement to bring him to the state of salutary and recruiting sleep, and thereby to suspend the action of a number of exciting powers, however slight their operation was, which were too much for the enfeebled state of his system, In the cases of children whose diseases are almost all asthenic, and in other diseases of high debility, instances of such ef∣fects of the diffusible stimuli, (for more than one was employed upon this as well as many other occasions) are equally numerous and surprising. In a very large practice I am sure I never, in the very worst cases, lost three patients.</NOTE> In asthenic diseases the watching state
<PB N="164" REF="022373_0178_0FB86B236BDF79D0"/>
for the most part is the consequence of direct debility, with some power acting with slight stimulant effect; the reason of which is, that the disease depends upon more debility than that which constitutes sleep. Hence it comes
<PB N="165" REF="022373_0179_0FB86B2485B0D538"/>
about, that every thing that stimulates, every thing that raises the excitement as it were to that point, which com∣poses <HI>the system</HI> to sleep, produces that effect by a stimu∣lant, not a sedative, virtue. In a small degree of debility, where the excitement has fallen only a little below the point of sleep, a very small degree of stimulus, such as a little animal food; if the weakness had been owing to vegetable food, such as wine, or any drink of equal pow∣er, after a water regimen; such as consolation in affliction of mind; heat, when cold has been the debilitating pow∣er; gentle exercise or gestation; or <HI>the stimulus</HI> of a plea∣sant train of thought, when one has been deprived of the stimulus of corporeal or mental exercise, is sufficient. In higher degree of debility (for the curative force should always be adapted to the degree of the disease<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See above, par.

<P>CCXLIV. In both which cases, the virtue, of opium is great; its virtue, however, is not peculiar to it, or a∣ny other than what it possesses in common with all the o∣ther stimulant powers, differing only from the rest in the higher degree of its<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The notion of some powerful remedies, as opium, mercury, the Jesuits' bark, &amp;c. acting by an operation peculiar to each, and different from every other power in nature, was long prevalent in the schools of medicine.

Accordingly, in the exciting powers that act upon the excitability of our bodies, we find only one action, that of stimulating, varying only in its degree, to take place in all animal as well as vegetable bodies, nay in every thing that we know to possess life in the universe. We also find, to the same ex∣tent, only one property in living systems upon which it acts, that is, the excitability; and one effect produced by the mutual relation betwixt them in that respect, to wit, the excitement.

in fevers, as in a violent fit of the gout, disturbing with tumul∣tuary disorder the internal parts, and in other similar diseases of debility, in which the violence of the disease keeps off sleep; opium often, after the watchful state has remained many days, brings on profound and sound sleep; in which case, be∣cause the excitability is very abundant, and, therefore, can bear but a very small force of stimulus, we should, on that account, begin with the smallest degree of stimulus, and proceed gradually to more and more<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CVII.</NOTE>; till at last we arrive at the point of sleep, which will soon happen, as it is placed much within the range of direct debility: And with respect to coma, or that sleep which is not recruit∣ing: such is the effect both of other diffusible stimuli and of opium, that it converts morbid sleep into vigilance; vigilance, after a certain space of time, into refreshing sleep, and, in that way, conducts <HI>the patient</HI> safely, gently, and pleasantly, to health.

of sleep, upon account of too long a suspension of sti∣mulant action, has been of less service than was expected, to shorten its next attack, and renew the operation of the stimulus.</P>
<P>CCXLV. In asthenic diseases, and those arising from indirect debility, in which sleep is also kept off; in order both to restore it, and remove the other symptoms, and bring about the healthy state, both other stimuli should be employed according to the degree of debility requiring their use, and, when the degree of debility is very considerable, the diffusible stimuli, and among the rest opium, should <HI>not be omitted.</HI></P>
<P>CCXLVI. These are the times and circumstances of the body in which opium produces sleep. In all the other states either of health or disease, it excites the functions both of body and mind, as well as of passion and emotion; among others it banishes sleep and produces great activity and vigilance, Thus if any one is under the pressure of sleep without an evident cause, he will by opium be ren∣dered surprisingly sprightly, lively, and vigilant; it banish∣es melancholy, begets confidence, converts fear into bold∣ness, makes the silent eloquent, and dastards brave. No∣body, in desperate circumstances, and sinking under a dis∣relish for life, ever laid violent hands on himself after ta∣king <HI>a dose of</HI> opium, or ever will. In one word, through all the intermediate degrees of excitement from direct to indirect debility, opium is by far the most powerful of all the agents, and as such must be most hurtful in sthenic di∣athesis, because, when added to the other stimulant pow∣ers, it not only banishes sleep, but is liable to precipitate those diseases from the sthenic state to indirect debility, and from this last to death.</P>

Nor is it unconnected with this explanati∣on of <HI>the nature of</HI> sleep and watching, and of both of them being sometime repelled, sometimes induced, by a certain degree of stimulus<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"> See above, par. CCXLI. where this proposition is reduced to its exact principle.</NOTE>; that excessive motions, and con∣vulsive, which have been mentioned<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CCXXX.</NOTE>, such as the quick pulse in fevers<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">See par. CLXXIX.</NOTE> and other <HI>motions,</HI> are removed by an e∣qual force of stimuli, <HI>to that which is required to remove morbid affection</HI> without <HI>any</HI> motions. Hence <HI>it is plain, that</HI> irregular motions are not only not encreased functions<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"> See above, CCXXIX.</NOTE>, independent upon debility, but that they are impaired func∣tions, and consist nearly in the same degree of debility.</P>
<P>CCL. From what has been said, the analogy between watching and life, and sleep and death, and their depen∣dence upon the same laws of nature, that govern all the other functions, clearly appears; and the most solid pro∣bation has been adduced, that the most vigorous vigilance consists in the highest degree of salutary excitement; that the middle and deep period of sleep depends on the high∣est debility that is consistent with the healthy state; that true sleep depends on a middle degree of indirect debility, and that both morbid sleep and morbid watching are the offspring of great debility, whether of the indirect or direct kind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Cure of both the Diatheses.</HEAD>
<P>CCLI. As the cause of both the diatheses is that which has been formerly<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CXLVIII.</NOTE> related; the indication of cure, therefore, to be taken from that is, in the sthenic diathesis to diminish excessive excitement over the whole system; in the asthenic to encrease deficient excitement <HI>likewise over all the system,</HI> till it be brought to that degree, which proves the cause of health.</P>
<P>CCLII. The remedies that produce that effect in <HI>the cure of</HI> sthenic diathesis, are the powers, which, when their stimulant operation is excessive, produce that very diathesis, in this case, acting with that slight and reduced force of stimulus, by which they produce less excitement than health requires, or by which they prove debilita∣ting.</P>
<P>CCLIII. The powers which produce the same effect in the asthenic diathesis, are those that, when their stimu∣lus is small, produce that diathesis, <HI>in this case,</HI> exciting with that high degree of stimulus, by means of which they give more excitement, than suits the healthy state, or by means of which they stimulate.</P>
<P>CCLIV. In the sthenic diathesis that temperature<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"> The same order is followed here, that has all along been obser∣ved, to wit, that of the enumeration of the powers in par. XI. and XIII. and that of the explanation of them, when viewed as the hurtful powers producing either diathesis in Chap. I. Part II. and it will be kept to throughout the whole work. Nothing can be more simple and natural, and better suit the simplicity of the subject, while nothing is more artifi∣cial and arbitrary than the arrangements either of Systematics or Noso∣logists. Just order could never be expected from an erroneous and confu∣sed view of the subject to be treated of; while a clear conception of the subject as a whole, infallibly leads to a distinct distributi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the several parts that compose it; so that what Horace says of language, equally ap∣plies to order, and the same thing applies here as to his <HI>Verba &amp; lucidus ordo. Rite paratam rem verba baud invita sequentur.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="171" REF="022373_0185_0FB86B320350F020"/>
which is called heat, must by all means be avoided; <HI>and</HI> for this <HI>very good</HI> reason, that the only degree of it which proves debilitating, that is the excessive to an ex∣treme, cannot be carried to that height, in which it de∣bilitates, without the risk of hurtful or pernicious conse∣quence from the excess of stimulus<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"> See above, par. CXV. Though very intense heat relaxes the simple and induces atony on the living solids, who, in a peripneumony, would think of using it with that view? That disease from its own vi∣olence, often mounts up so high in the scale of encreased stimulus, as nearly to approach the point of indirect debility, and it sometimes actu∣ally gains that point. The addition, therefore, of more stimulus from the application of heat, would ensure that effect, and thereby occasion the conversion of the disease into a much worse one, such as hydrotho∣rax, or the dropsy of the breast.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLV. But, when the diathesis, and its cause the en∣creased stimulus, is gentle in the actual diseased state, there is no occasion for forbidding that degree of heat, which accompanies <HI>the operation of</HI> sweating and pediluvi∣um<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"> Pediluvium is the warm bath of the legs and feet.</NOTE>; because the waste of fluids in the former, and the agreeable sensation in the latter, promise somewhat more advantage, than the moderate <HI>degree of</HI> heat <HI>employed in this case</HI> threatens disadvantage.</P>
<P>CCLVI. In a particular manner, after the applica∣tion of cold in an intense degree, must <HI>the application of</HI> heat be avoided, because its operation, from the increase of the excitability by cold, becomes more effective<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"> See above, par. XXXVII. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and note (d).</NOTE>. And the consequence is the more to be dreaded, that, at the same time, other stimuli are usually urgent.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="022373_0186_0FB86B33AE0CDD38"/>
CCLVII. Cold is the beneficial <HI>degree of</HI> tempera∣ture <HI>in the cure of</HI> this diathesis, <HI>but it must be cold</HI> not followed by any considerable degree of heat. That mi∣stake, therefore, in medical practice, of thinking cold hurtful in sthenic diathesis by a stimulant operation, should be corrected; and its benefit in the small-pox is not to be understood to arise so much from its mere debilita∣ting degree, as from avoiding the stimulus of heat after its operation. When the same precaution is employed, the same cold either alone, or in conjunction with other debilitating powers, has lately been found the most effectual remedy of catarrh<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"> or the common cold in English, a name stampt upon it by the ve∣ry blunder we have been speaking of.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLVIII. From which circumstance, and because a cap of fresh dug up earth put upon the head, has been of service in phrenitis; and that degree of cold, which produ∣ces frost and snow, when applied to the naked body, has removed a synocha accompanied with delirium<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><P>It is called the common inflammatory fever, very improperly, as being no fever, but a general pyrexia, or affection of the whole system, without inflammation or local affection, and producing heat over all and tumultuous effect upon the pulse. Its proper generic name is pyrex∣ia. See above par. LXVIII. where that appellation is assigned to it: an appellation to avoid mistaking its nature, that should be accurately attended to. Great mischief has been occasioned by this vague term. Thus when a person is said to be affected with a disease; when it is asked what disease it is, and the answer given, that it is a fever, immediately bleeding is thought of, though that, and every, evacuation is as hurt∣ful in proper fever as it may be serviceable in the pyrexia. To give an example of this pyrexia, the particular appellation for which is synocha, or sthenic pyrexial disease; many years ago, a person in the old town of Edinburgh, labouring under it, escaped the vigilance of his nurse; flew naked out of the house in a very keen frost with snow upon the ground, across the streets, passed over into the new town, and from that to the fields beyond it. He soon became sensible of his state, stole into a house next to him, got some clothes thrown about him, and was carried home in a chair, perfectly cured of his disease. From which, and a prodigi∣ous number of facts to the same purpose, all concuring in the proof of the debilitating operation of cold, there can hardly arise a doubt in the mind, that in a certain high degree, if it could be conveniently used, or if there were occasion to have recourse to it for want of efficacious reme∣dies, it would at once remove the highest degree of sthenic state that e∣ver occurs in disease, and reduce the excitement from the nearest ap∣proach to 70 down to 40. Nay it might run into the opposite extreme and go all the way to death. But we shall, by and by, have occasion to observe, that we are so well provided with effectual remedies as not to be under any temptation of straining this to its height. And we shall also find that a number of remedies in a moderate degree are preferable to any one, or to a smaller number in a higher degree. The discovery of the principle upon which the cure of sthenic diseases turns, has ena∣bled us to render the cure both more complete and exact, than it could have been without principle.</P></NOTE>; and
<PB N="173" REF="022373_0187_0FB86B38A94EE7C8"/>
because cold is so efficacious <HI>a remedy</HI> in the small-pox; it clearly follows, that the use of cold should be extended to the whole range <HI>of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the whole circle of dis∣eases, depending upon sthenic diathesis.</P>
<P>CCLIX. That no hurtful effect arises from the sup∣posed astringent power of cold in the sthenic diathesis<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><P>I remember, when I was a young student, of hearing the old phy∣sicians in Edinburgh very gravely forbid a draught of cold water in an inflammatory pyrexia and even in a common catarrh, for fear it should produce an inflammation in the stomach.</P></NOTE>, is proved by its very high influence, when applied to the surface of the body in the small-pox, in keeping up a freedom of perspiration in proportion to the degree of its application. And its influence in producing atony with proportional laxity <HI>of the fibres of the vessels,</HI> is in confor∣mity to the same observation<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><P>The fibres being relaxed describe a greater cavity, and hence the check given to the perspiration by the contrary effect of the sthenic dia∣thesis in encreasing their density and diminishing their diameters, is taken off.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLX. For the removal of asthenic diathesis the stimu∣lus
<PB N="174" REF="022373_0188_0FB86B3BD8C4C260"/>
of heat is signally useful, and chiefly for the follow∣ing reason; that it must be as useful in this diathesis, where the excitement is too low, as it is hurtful in the sthe∣nic, by giving a further encrease of the excitement, too much encreased already. Hence in fevers, in the gout, in dyspepsia, in the cholic, in rheumatalgia<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"> or what is improperly, as it has been said before, called the chro∣nic rheumatism.</NOTE>, and in all asthenic diseases, the system is very much cherished by heat, and debilitated by cold: Which, by its debilitating effect, is ranked among the powers that produce the dis∣ease<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><P>No gouty person can bear the operation of much cold, and every one can endure more heat, than most other persons. And the reason is evident: So debilitating a power must, in proportion to its degree, be peculiarly hurtful in all diseases, in which the debility constituting their cause, runs high, as it naturally does in the gout, where it is encreased by the advance of age and other causes, and much more so in fevers.</P></NOTE>, and is destructive in fevers.</P>
<P>CCLXI. As cold is hurtful in asthenic diathesis in the proportion in which it is serviceable in the sthenic<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"> See par. CCLVIII.</NOTE>; it is accordingly, for this further reason, to be avoided in dis∣eases of the highest debility, that, like intense heat, it re∣laxes the extreme vessels, and produces a putrefaction in the fluids<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See above, CXVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLXII. The more certainly to moderate the sthenic diathesis while as yet it remains within the range of pre∣disposition, a sparing use should be made of flesh and the preparations from it, and vegetable dishes used with grea∣ter freedom. But, when the same diathesis is encreased to the degree, that constitutes disease, abstinence from animal food, especially in a solid form, and a free, but still not excessive, use of vegetable matter, especially in a fluid form, are the best means of removing it, as far as the ma∣nagement of diet goes.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="022373_0189_0FB86B3D474897F0"/>
CCLXIII. In that degree of this diathesis, which does not exceed predisposition, it is proper to avoid seasoning, which is destructive in diseases.</P>
<P>CCLXIV. Watery drink is very suitable to it, and all pure and strong drink hurtful, and that in proportion to the quantity of alkahol that it contains. The latter <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of</HI> drink, unless <HI>taken</HI> very weak, is destructive in diseases. In the number of which pure water, especially with an addition <HI>of something to</HI> acidulate <HI>it,</HI> is preferable to small∣beer, which a great authority admitted. But the diffusible stimuli in this diathesis are above all others hurtful.</P>
<P>CCLXV. Since the indirect stimulus of food assists the direct, that is, propagates itself over the whole body; for that reason bounds should be set to the bulk even of the suitable matter<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CXXVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLXVI. In every degree of asthenic diathsis, vege∣table food should be avoided, and recourse had as soon as possible to that, which consists of meat and animal matter. And, as that can seldom be executed immediately upon account of the weakness of the stomach; the diffusible sti∣muli should, therefore, be used; such as the <HI>different</HI> forms of wine when the debility is moderate, and opiates when it is greater. <HI>And at the same time,</HI> from the very begin∣ning rich soups should be given in great quantity upon the whole, and a gradual transition made to the use of more solid matter.</P>
<P>CCLXVII. As it is animal matter in this case, that is of service, so the degree of stimulus, that seasoning adds to it, improves its effect<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CXXV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLXVIII. During the predisposition to asthenic dis∣eases, watery, cold, acid, fermenting drink is hurtful, and that proportion of pure strong liquor, that the degree of debility requires, is beneficial. But after the diseases
<PB N="176" REF="022373_0190_0FB86B3EC4D263E8"/>
have actually taken place, and have now attained a high degree of vehemence, the same strong drink becomes so indispensably necessary, that excepting the soups, and the still more diffusible stimuli, it is the only <HI>support</HI> required for a long time. There is no occasion for any dread of the indirect stimulus of food, when the matter, which chiefly affords it, that is, vegetable matter, is guarded against<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Compare this with what was lately said in paragraph CCLXV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLXIX. For <HI>the purpose of </HI> diminishing the stimulus, which an over proportion of chyle and blood<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><P>The chyle is the alimentary matter, that has undergone a prepa∣ration in the stomach, and an after one in the upper part of the intesti∣nal canal, and, which so prepared, or in part digested, is taken up by the months of a number of small vessels that open into the intestines; these carry it to a great trunk, in which all these vessels, called lacteal, unite, and through that trunk, to be afterwards mixed, first with the venous, and then with all the other blood in succession. Such is the nourishing matter of animals.</P></NOTE>, directly applied to a great extent of the body, produces; the over proportion, when it is very great, should be removed by abstinence, bleeding, and purging: when it is more mo∣derate, but yet adequate to the effect of producing diseases, the directions lately given<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CCLV.</NOTE>, respecting a moderate dia∣thesis, ought to be observed; that is, we should adhere to <HI>the practice of </HI> vomiting and purging from time to time, and to a sparingness in diet. But blood should not be let. And, if upon any occasion, the patient shall give way to a little fulness in his use of food, he should use vegetable mat∣ter, abstinence, gentle and frequent exercise, and sweating, and, thereby, keep up a full perspiration.</P>
<P>CCLXX. The same are the means of cure for an ex∣cess in the velocity of the blood<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CXXXI. to CXXXIV.</NOTE>, in so far as it depends upon an over proportion: when the velocity depends upon violent motion of the body, the means of lessening it, when
<PB N="177" REF="022373_0191_0FB86B40684A54C0"/>
the diathesis is so moderate, <HI>as only</HI> to produce predispo∣sition, or a gentle degree of actual disease, are an abate∣ment of exercise, more indulgence in rest, and a reduction of other stimuli. In the very great diathesis, that which occasions severe diseases, in order to retard the motion of the blood, a point must be made to avoid the stimulus of all the exciting powers, and blood must be taken profu∣sely. <HI>Here</HI> it is superfluous to lay down a rule <HI>for the ob∣servance of keeping the body in a state</HI> of rest, as rest, even in spite of the patients, in unavoidable<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">It would be ridiculous to require of a patient in the rage of peri∣pneumony not to run a race, when his real state is, that he cannot move or turn himself in the bed without pain.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLXXI. Withdrawing the powers that occasion an over-proportion of the secreted fluids in the excretory ducts, is the best method of removing the stimulus, which that over-proportion, by its distending energy, produ∣ces<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">In par. CXXXVI. you will find, that the secreted fluids, here al∣luded to, are the milk, the semen, and the perspirable fluid. As the distention occasioned by the over-abundance produces the morbid stimu∣lus, so the subduction of the fluids must, of course, take it off, and give the desired relief.</NOTE>. <HI>The cure, therefore, consists in</HI> more frequent coition, drawing off the milk, taking in food of a less nourishing nature, and in restoring the perspiration by re∣moving the sthenic diathesis upon the external surface.</P>
<P>CCLXXII. To remove the debility, or atony and laxity, of the vessels, which is occasioned by a penury of chyle and blood over a very great extent of the system<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">How great the space of extent of the system is, that, in the sthe∣nic diathesis, receives the stimulus of an over-abundance of blood; and, in the asthenic diathesis is subjected to the debilitating power of an un∣der-proportion of the the same fluid, may easily be conceived from the well known fact, that there is not a soft part in the whole system, into which the insertion of the point of the finest needle will not draw blood; consequently, the stimulus arising from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over-abundance of blood, as well as the debility arising from too small a quantity, must be the most considerable of all others. Every circumstance here concurs to render the one the greatest sthenic, and the other an equal asthenic, hurtful power. If the force of every stimulus, of every exciting power, be in proportion, first, to the degree of it applied; secondly, to the sensibility of the part on which it acts; and, thirdly, to the extent of that part, it will be no wonder, that these two powers should prove the most formi∣dable of all others. Hence it is, that, in the curative part, bleeding is the most powerful remedy of sthenic, and filling the vessels an equal one, of asthenic diathesis.</NOTE>,
<PB N="178" REF="022373_0192_0FB86B433A7EFDA8"/>
first, the strength must be gradually brought back by dif∣fusible stimuli<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">which act by giving vigour to the whole system, and more espe∣cially to the stomach, with which they come into actual contact. Hence digestion, and the conversion of the matter taken in into good chyle, and blood; and hence, at last, the fulness of the vessels first indicated. The process of emptying the vessels in the cure of sthenic diathesis has the advantage of being the first in order; and hence is it that the cure of sthenic disease is more quickly effected than that of the asthenic; it be∣ing, over all nature, much more easy to take away than replace. See and compare par. CXXVI. and CXXX. and subjoined notes, and a lit∣tle above, par. CCLXVI.</NOTE> and soups; next, we should gradually use the latter more sparingly, and solid matter more plenti∣fully: lastly, to give the whole system still more strength, it should be fortified by exercise, and the rest of the du∣rable stimuli; but no further use should be made of the diffusible, than to employ them so long as considerable de∣bility remains<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The sole use, and a great one, of the diffusible stimuli is, in great weakness, where they are only required, to support the system, while it cannot be supported by the ordinary durable stimuli; and, after the ex∣citement is so far restored, that the ordinary supports <HI>are</HI> now sufficient, to lay aside the extraordinary; the continuance of which would now be hurtful, and to manage the convalescent, and restored, state of health by the powers employed in health. When the diffusible are continued lon∣ger, they are equally hurtful, and a cause of disease, as they are service∣able when disease requires their support; analogous to wine, they bring about the system in a weakened state to be sustained by its natural and ordinary supports; but, analogous to it in another respect, when the strength of the system requires not their additional stimulus, they carry it up into indirect debility, and prove the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of diseases and death. In one word, whatever has been said against the propriety of the use of excessive, and ultimately excessive stimulant powers, the former produ∣cing sthenic diathesis, and the latter indirect debility, all that applies, with propriety, for the discontinuance of the use of diffusible stimuli, when the durable are now sufficient for the purposes of the system. And another argument that still remains against the superfluous use of both the diffusibles and strong drink, when debility requires not their use; is, that, independent of death, or even diseases, being their immediate consequence, predisposition to diseases must; consequently, as the system must at last be worn by stimuli, all the unnecessary, that is, all that do not contribute to that middle vigour, in which sound health consists, should be avoided.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="022373_0193_0FB86B4721855068"/>
CCLXXIII. In a weak state both of the vessels and of the rest of the body, every motion of the body, any way considerable, and all other stimuli, which quicken the motion of the blood, and bring on an indirect tem∣porary debility, should be with-held. But, in a case of slighter debility, such motion as does not prove fatiguing, but acts as an agreeable stimulus, and gives recruit, should not be avoided. When a person is recovering from a disease, he should be gradually brought back to his usual plan of life; nor should it be forgot, that, till that is done, the health is never completely restored.</P>
<P>CCLXXIV. The debility which an under-propor∣tion of secreted fluids, or a degenerate, though plentiful state of them, produces in the excretory ducts, is removed by the stimulant plan of cure which has just now been spo∣ken of<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See above, CCLXXII.</NOTE>, not by an antiseptic one<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See above, CXVII. and CXVI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLXXV. The suitable remedy of that <HI>sort of</HI> stimu∣lus, which arises from either violence or assiduity of think∣ing, is an abatement <HI>in the degree</HI> of thinking, or that high stretch of the intellectual function, whether its de∣gree
<PB N="180" REF="022373_0194_0FB86B494BE56900"/>
or frequent <HI>repetition</HI> be regarded, that, by wasting the excitability, proves, at last, indirectly debilitating: Which is a rule, however it may suit the state of predis∣position, that is by no means safe, after the disease has once made its appearance, and especially if it is a violent one; because there is no access to any benefit from it, but through the intermediate degrees of that stimulant range, which, by encreasing the excitement, already too great, would do mischief<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See above, CCLIV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLXXVI. In order to cure a slight sthenic diathesis, <HI>such as</HI> occurs in predisposition, and to prevent disease, habitual passion should be avoided; but the removal of actual disease requires, that every first gust of passion should be prevented. The ultimate excess of passion, upon account of the intermediate danger of stimulating too much, is by no means to be thought of.</P>
<P>CCLXXVII. In so far as debility depends upon ex∣cess in mental exertion, or upon a languid state of that faculty, the excess should be diminished, and the languor removed, and an agreeable train of thinking set on foot; without which latter, however much all the other sti∣mulant powers may have been employed, it may be de∣pended upon, that perfect health, in every respect, will not be brought about<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">The state of the intellectual function has a great influence upon that of excitement; and, often, when all other stimuli have been ap∣plied in due proportion, the deficiency of that single stimulus will point out a want in the proper measure of excitement. There is not a finer stimulus than the pleasurable feeling arising from a happy train or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low of thinking; hence the high delight, that arises from a flight of wit, or from a pleasant vein of humour; hence all the fine feelings of the bel∣les letters; hence, in youth, the ardent keenness to be acquainted with the learning, wisdom, and elegant productions of the antients, as well as of those, who have made a distinguished figure in later times; hence the enthusiasm, so natural to the human feelings, to out-strip others in every mental excellency: The arts, the sciences, every department of human knowledge, are all the effects of that intellectual propensity. How happy would it be for mankind were this noble stimulus duly che∣rished! What benefits, which society is deprived of, would not accrue from a proper cultivation of it! How fine was that feeling in Julius Caesar Scaliger, when he declared he would rather be the author of Ho∣race's few stanzas of Lydia and Telephus, than accept of the crown of Arragon!

See Observations on the principles of the old Systems of Physic, from page ix. to xv. of the Introduction. How delightful must the feelings of Horace have been, in whose works every Ode is an effort of the most beautiful, and, frequently, of the most sublime, conceptions of human genius! What must have been the fire and force of Milton's soul, in the description that he gives of the appear∣ance of the Son of God in his coelestial panoply, "<HI>his countenance too severe to be behold!</HI>" How towering that soul, how exalted that intellect, which the great Marquis of Montrose displayed in a stratagem, which covert∣ed into a glorious victory a blunder in one of his officers, that might have proved fatal to both his cause and his glory. When it was whisper∣ed to him, standing in the center of his army, that one of his wings was overpowered, he shouts out to the commander in the other: "My Lord Aboyn, shall you and I stand here doing nothing, and M'Donald carry off all the honour of the day!"</NOTE>.</P>

CCLXXVIII. In every degree of debility that high force of the passions, that produces indirect debility, must be avoided; and it must not be forgot, that a very small degree of them is sufficient for that effect: we are not to give loose reins to agreeable passions<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See above, par.

She was in the state of a famished person, whose accumulated excitability is overpowered by a single morsel of food, or of a person, who had been long affected with thirst, where the smallest indulgence in drink may prove fatal; or of a person, near starved to death by cold, in whom a rash approach to heat, might induce the same fatal effect; all which are precisely upon the same footing, and equal instances of an excitabili∣ty too accumulated to bear any degree of stimulus.</NOTE>.</P>

For there is only a sum total of the passions, which act in the same manner as all the other stimuli, that is, by stimulating, either in excess, or in due, or in deficient, proportion; nay, like the rest, as often as any one is de∣ficient, it, by accumulating the excitability, has the ef∣fect of making the other stimuli act more powerfully<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. XXXVII. and the note annexed to it,</NOTE>. Take, for instances, the terror of an army before the sound of trumpet for the onset of battle, and the courage with which they are afterwards inspired, from the con∣sciousness of their bravery, the General's speech to ani∣mate them, or, perhaps, his commemoration of their for∣mer brave deeds.</P>
<P>Ρ. An ultimately excessive voluptuousness in the exer∣cise of the senses, as well as the effect of disagreeable ob∣jects, presented to them, in asthenic diathesis, should e∣qually

<P>Σ. Nothing is better accommodated to the asthenic state than purity of air: which, either alone, or conjoined with exercise, must, consequently, be of the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est benefit to convalescents.</P>
<P>Τ. Since the matter of contagion, in so far as it has any tendency to produce general disease, produces either sthe∣nic<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">as in the small-pox and measles,</NOTE>, or asthenic, diathesis<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">as the contagious typhus, the gangrenous sore threat, dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entery, and the plague</NOTE>, and acts by an operation similar to that of the general hurtful powers; <HI>the inference to be drawn from that is,</HI> that in the cure, general remedies should <HI>be employed;</HI> and debilitating ones opposed to sthe∣nic, stimulant ones to asthenic, diathesis<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Par.

<P>CCLXXX. These powers, the same in kind with those that produce the diatheses, differing only in de∣gree, and in that respect diametrically opposite, remove the diathesis seldomer, and less successfully, one by one; oftener, and more effectually, <HI>when</HI> several co-operate, but, best of all, if all of them be taken together, especi∣ally when there is occasion for great assistance.</P>

<P>CCLXXXI. AS, in the sthenic diathesis, bleeding is the most powerful remedy of all others, being that, which completely carries off a stimulus, as much more powerful <HI>than any other,</HI> as it is directly applied to a greater extent over the system; consequently, as often as the diathesis
<PB N="184" REF="022373_0198_0FB867BB883B7F88"/>
is very high, it should be freely used; but never risked du∣ring predisposition, and sparingly, or not at all, ventured upon in diseases of a gentle nature; in which other reme∣dies should be preferred<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CCLXIX. With the exception of peripneumony, phrenitis, and violent and mismanaged cases of the small pox and mea∣sles, and rheumatism; in the last in their mild state, as well as the other sthenic cases, the lancet should never be unsheathed. That is to say, in seven cases out of ten even of the sthenic diseases, which are the only ones that either require or bear any degree of it, the practice must be laid aside, and never thought of in any asthenic affections whatever. Consequently, the cases, where it is in any degree allowable, are exceed∣ingly few.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLXXXII. The next place of importance to <HI>bleeding,</HI> when heat and other stimuli are guarded against, is claim∣ed by cold. Heat is always hurtful, and still more so af∣ter a previous application of cold; but it is most hurtful, when it is also combined with other excessive stimulant powers. Cold is always of service, and in proportion to its degree; provided foreign stimuli, blended with it, and overcoming <HI>its debilitating effect,</HI> be cautiously shunned.</P>
<P>CCLXXXIII. The third place in rank after these re∣medies is claimed by vomiting and purging and sweating. These evacuations have a powerful effect in removing sthenic diathesis, and therefore do they, with great advan∣tage, supersede the oftener imaginary than real, necessity of profuse bleeding. They are often alone sufficient to re∣store the healthy state.</P>
<P>CCLXXXIV. Together with all these, the articles of diet, the stimulant operation of which prevents the be∣nefits to be received from them, should be sparingly used, and that in <HI>exact</HI> proportion to the degree of the diathesis. This precaution alone is adequate to the removal of pre∣disposition, and often to that of diseases, especially those that depend upon a small and gentle diathesis.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="022373_0199_0FB867BD031B70D0"/>
CCLXXXV. Also with all <HI>the remedies yet mentioned</HI> we must conjoin rest, when the diseased state has taken place, and moderation in motion during the period of pre∣disposition<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">So considerable a stimulus is exercise, that, if in such a degree of sthenic diathesis, as that, which forms only predisposition to the diseases depending on it, exercise may of itself be sufficient to effect the conver∣sion of the predisposition into the actual diseased state. Often has the highest of these diseases, and even peripneumony itself, been brought on by violent exertion in exercise.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLXXXVI. The practice of the common run of physicians is very bad, in going too much upon any one of the remedies <HI>that have been mentioned,</HI> and overlooking all the rest, or enjoining them carelessly. We are not to de∣pend upon bleeding alone, not even in peripneumony it∣self; but employ all the rest either in concourse or suc∣cession.</P>

<P>CCLXXXVIII. The symptoms of debility, which are the consequences of the violence of the sthenic diathesis, in the progress of the disease, and that threaten death by in∣direct debility, ought to be prevented by an early interpo∣sition of the remedies.</P>
<P>CCLXXXIX. The same early cure serves to prevent suppuration, effusion, and gangrene, which arise from ul∣timately excessive excitement, passing into indirect debility.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The same Comparison of the different Parts of the Asthenic Plan of Cure with one another.</HEAD>
<P>CCXC. IN asthenic diathesis, and the diseases depen∣ding upon it, reproducing the <HI>lost</HI> quantity of blood, is the most powerful remedy, when we, at last, find access to it, as being the only means of restoring a stimulus of so much more power and efficacy, that its direct application is made to so great an extent of the system<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Compare this with par. CCLXXXI. above, and with all the pa∣ragraphs from CXXXI. to an CXXXVI.</NOTE>. For which reason, as, in every degree of debility, the quan∣tity of food, from which only blood is made, that is taken and digested, is always in an inverse, proportion to the de∣gree of debility<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Or in a direct proportion to the degree of excitement.</NOTE>; so much, and of such a form, as can be taken and digested, should immediately, and without loss of time, be administered; on which account, if the debility be moderate, giving solid animal food sparingly each time, but often repeated, is proper and suitable. When the debility is greater, and solid animal food can neither be taken, nor if taken, digested, broth made from it, as rich as possible, and as free of fatty matter, should be carefully administred<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Compare this with par. CCLXXII.</NOTE>, <HI>With this view</HI> to excite the stomach, and render it more fit for receiving and dige∣sting the food <HI>just now</HI> mentioned; the diffusible stimuli, such as different kinds of wine, and more particularly still opiates and other remedies of similar powerfulness, ought to be constantly employed; sparingly at first, and afterwards more fully, if the debility be direct: after which, the use of the diffusible should be gradually laid
<PB N="187" REF="022373_0201_0FB867C204D526F0"/>
aside, and, in the same gradual way, recourse be had to a larger and larger use of the more durable and natural sti∣muli<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See last note (<HI>e</HI>), and compare it with this.</NOTE>. In <HI>the case of</HI> indirect debility, we should al∣so gradually proceed from the highest to the lowest force of stimulus, as has been mentioned formerly<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Par. CIII.</NOTE>, and, in an inverse manner, go on from the smallest force of dura∣ble stimulus to the greatest. Lastly, in that moderate de∣bility, which constitutes the predisposition to asthenic diseases, it must always be kept in mind, that an abun∣dance of blood is the greatest support of health<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">How widely different is that maxim from any that have hitherto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver been received in the profession of physic; in which flying to the use of the lancet, was the first thought that arose in the mind, with respect to the idea of cure of every disease; and bleeding and evacuations, through the course of each disease, the only remedies.</NOTE>, and that we are not to give way to weakened appetite<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">This is equally the reverse of the general practice of inanition in almost every disease, without a single exception.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>CI. To the vital fluid, and the several means of encreasing its quantity, which have just now been men∣tioned, the next remedy in the cure of asthenic diathesis is heat; as being the power by which animals<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">And we may add vegetables.</NOTE>, in their first formation, in their growth, and most especially in their decay, are brought forth into exstence, are nourish∣ed, and acquire vigour, and afterwards, through <HI>the seve∣ral degrees of</HI> their declining state, are to some extent up∣held, till their excitement is all extinguished<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Compare this with par. CXII. and CCLIV. and CCLX.</NOTE>. By heat, understand that point of external temperature, which in∣tervenes as a mean betwixt cold, as it is called, and high heat<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">The Latins have a single word for this which we want▪ the word <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ardor.</HI></NOTE>; under which our sense of temperature is agreea∣ble
<PB N="188" REF="022373_0202_0FB867C48E374C28"/>
and pleasant; under which the body is neither weaken∣ed by that relaxation which produces sweat, nor by that torpor<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Or benumbed state.</NOTE> which cold begets, <HI>where the debility is,</HI> in this case, direct, and in the former indirect; under which the functions of the whole body are excited, called forth, and, as it were, cherished in the sun beams; without which all other stimuli are of no effect<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">It is plain, that though all the other powers should be in full acti∣on upon our bodies, and that with the effect of keeping up in them a due degree of excitement over all; yet plunging any person naked into a dense medium, suppose that of water, in a degree of cold at or under the freezing point, will most certainly, in an instant, put an end to life.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCXCII. Such a temperature as that is suited to eve∣ry state of the body, but still more to <HI>its different states of</HI> debility; because, <HI>in the latter case,</HI> as the excitement is deficient from other sources, there is so much more occasi∣on for this stimulus, which is much easier come at than many others, <HI>to supply such deficiency.</HI> Hence, both in o∣ther diseases of great and direct debility, and particularly in fevers, heat is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to be of the greatest benefit, and above all others in all such complaints of that kind, as cold has had any share in producing<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See again, par. CCLX.</NOTE>. In the same diseases cold must be most carefully avoided, as it is always of a di∣rectly debilitating operation, and never of service but in sthenic diseases, and those that are in a progress to indirect debility<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">The operation of cold has been so widely mistaken by all physici∣ans, that it comes to be of the greatest consequence to understand the se∣veral propositions stated in this work with regard to it. For that pur∣pose consult par. XXXVII. and the note upon it marked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as well as par. CCLX▪ and all that has been said upon the subjects of either heat or cold in Chap. 1. of the second Part, from CXII. to CXXIII. as also par. CXX.</NOTE>. We must be equally on our guard, in every de∣gree of asthenic diathesis, against excessive heat; which is
<PB N="189" REF="022373_0203_0FB867C9DFCA2F00"/>
equally debilitating as cold, and equally productive of a∣tony, laxity, and gangrene of the vessels, as well as stag∣nation and corruption of the fluids, in consequence of the inactive state of the vessels<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">With this proposition compare par. CXV. CXVII. and CXVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCXCIII. As refilling the vessels is the greatest reme∣dy, because its direct stimulus is applied over such an ex∣tent of the system; for that reason heat, which is imme∣diately applied to the whole surface of the body, and di∣rectly affects the body to that extent, should be next in virtue <HI>to it.</HI></P>
<P>CCXCIV. Since vomiting, purging<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCLXXXIII.</NOTE> and sweat∣ing<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCLV.</NOTE> are so powerful in debilitating, as to claim the third place of rank in the sthenic cure: they must, for that reason, by the same debilitating operation, be equally hurtful in asthenic diathesis, and the stimuli that stop their operation, and, consequently, both the other stimuli, and particularly the diffusible ones, equally serviceable.</P>
<P>CCXCV. To run over the list of stimuli, that answer this purpose, we must begin with the cure of that slighter loss of fluids <HI>that occur</HI> in those diseases, and proceed to the more violent kinds of them.</P>
<P>In a slight looseness of belly, such as happens in predis∣position to asthenic diseases, or in the slighter degrees of the latter; it will be commonly sufficient to abstain from ve∣getable food, and from weak, watery drink, or that <HI>kind of it that</HI> ferments <HI>in the first passages,</HI> such as the several drinks made from barley, called beers; to use animal food, as well seasoned and as rich as possible, and free of all fatty matter; to drink pure wine, or spirit, in different degrees of strength; and to take <HI>such</HI> exercise <HI>as is</HI> gentle in degree, and often repeated<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">See and compare, for the more clear understanding of this para∣graph, the CCLXVI. CCLXVIII. CCLXXIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="022373_0204_0FB867CC08344FB0"/>
CCXCVI. When the belly is still, looser and <HI>with that affected</HI> with gripes and pains, as happens in the violent diarrhaea, and in the dysentery in which the loose stools are accompanied with vomiting: or when, without these troublesome symptoms <HI>affecting</HI> the belly, distressing vo∣miting is an urgent symptom; or, when the vomiting is conjoined with a moisture upon the surface, or macerating sweat; or when sweat is the only urgent symptom, and <HI>as such</HI> wastes the strength, exhausts the body, and dissipates the fluids: in all these cases, we must have immediate re∣course to the most diffusible stimuli, and check such an impoverishment of the fluids <HI>of the system.</HI></P>
<P>CCXCVII. In which case, the use of stimuli will be so much the more necessary, that other symptoms usually accompany those encreased excretions. Their great effca∣cy, and stimulant power, is proved by their singular virtue <HI>in removing</HI> those and other <HI>symptoms,</HI> in fevers and other most violent sthenic diseases, nay, in the article of death itself, from ultimate debility.</P>
<P>CCXCVIII. Accordingly, in spasms and convulsions in the internal, in the external, parts<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">See par. CXCV. and CXCVI.</NOTE>, in bleeding dis∣charges<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">See par. CXXXIV. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 4. and CCXXXII. and the subjoined notes.</NOTE>, in the direful delirium of fevers, and other very violent diseases<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">See par. CXCVIII. CC. CCI.</NOTE>, in sthenic inflammation<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCIV. to CCXII.</NOTE>; when those stimuli, which have a more permanent influence fail, or act to no <HI>good</HI> purpose; the virtue of the diffusible sti∣mulants, the principal of which is opium, is eminent.</P>
<P>CCXCIX. As, therefore, the energy of that stimulant virtue serves to check looseness of the belly, and vomiting, or even sweating, when these symptoms are gentle, and de∣pend upon a less violent <HI>degree</HI> of the cause; so that de∣gree
<PB N="191" REF="022373_0205_0FB867CD86A55EC8"/>
of its power, which is fitted to check these affections in the greatest height of their violence, and to re-establish the state of health, is by far the greatest of all the powers, which are ever applied to the human body; which may be known from this proof, that when the action of all the other powers by which life is supported is of no effect, they turn aside the instant stroke of death.</P>
<P>CCC. The most weak degree of the diffusible stimuli<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">See above par. CXXVI. ο. π. ρ. ς</NOTE> are the white wines, except madeira, canary, good sherry and the red wines, except port and spirits procured by distillation, so diluted, as to equal the strength of the wines, or exceed it a little. Still higher than these are the latter <HI>taken</HI> pure, and higher still, those that have undergone many rectifications. The strength of which is in proportion to the quantity of water expelled, and of the alkali retained.</P>
<P>CCCI. A higher place in the scale is claimed by musk, volatile alkali, camphor; our trials of which are not yet so complete, as to ascertain its force exactly: next comes aether, and, last of all, opium. Of all which, however, unless, when, as they sometimes do, they have lost their effect by a continuance of their application, and are, there∣fore, substituted in place of each other for the sake of a re∣newal of the operation of each; and when, in that way we make the complete round of them, for the sake of re∣pelling extreme debility; <HI>in every respect,</HI> the preparations of opium are sufficient for most purposes of high stimula∣ting</P>
<P>CCCII. Together with all these<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">They are animal soups, and solid meat (CCXC.) heat, (CCXCI.) stimulants (CCXCV.) diffusible stimulants CCXCIX.)</NOTE>, regard must be had to <HI>the articles of</HI> diet<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCLXXXIV.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="022373_0206_0FB867CF0A7B9FD0"/>
And, as in great debility, and the diseases depending upon it, of the only suitable matter, that is meat, nothing solid can be taken; for that reason, the matter to be used must be fluid, but strong. Animal soups should be given sparingly at a time, but repeatedly, in proportion to the degree of debility, and jellies both along with the diffusible stimuli. After that, when, chiefly by means of the dif∣fusive stimuli, the strength is in part restored; at first solid meat, likewise in sparing quantities, but often repeated; then <HI>given</HI> more plentifully, and at greater intervals, should be taken. <HI>In which progress</HI> the patient should gradually recede from the use of the diffusible stimuli.</P>
<P>CCCIII. When now the diffusible stimuli are altoge∣ther laid aside, and the convalescent is given up to his usu∣al manner of living, and that management, which persons in health commonly observe, (only that more care is taken <HI>than in perfect health,</HI> to avoid any thing that might prove hurtful); then it is, that every attempt of the physician should be directed to the consideration of the strength of his patient, as returning, but not yet <HI>quite</HI> established<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See above par. CV. and CIX.</NOTE>. In his movements he should first use gestation, and then gentle but frequent exercise, and the latter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould always end in some, but not an high, degree of fatigue. His sleep should neither be too long, nor too short, lest the former produce direct, the latter indirect debility<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCXLII. and sequent.</NOTE>: the most nourishing food should be taken, but not in too great a quantity, lest the excitability of the stomach be worn off, without the attainment of a due degree of vigour, but it should be often taken, in order to reduce the excitability gradually, which only serves to produce proper vigour, and reduce it to its half wasted state<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See above the XXIV. XXV. and XXVI.</NOTE>; that degree of heat, which stimulates, should be employed<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See par. CXII.</NOTE>, and both excess of it, as well as cold, as they are equally debilitating, should
<PB N="193" REF="022373_0207_0FB867D08440CE60"/>
be avoided; the patient should breathe pure air, and avoid impure; he should keep his mind in gentle action, observe moderation in his passions, and court agreeable objects of sense; he should have no companions around him, but a∣greeable ones, and be in frequent gay entertainments; he should travel through a pleasant country, and be moderate in love. Neither is the management of the senses, and any return of contagious matter to be neglected.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>How the Remedies should be varied.</HEAD>
<P>CCCIV. AS the hurtful powers, that produce predis∣position to diseases, or diseases themselves, act some on one part, some on another, with somewhat more force than <HI>on any other equal part;</HI> and as such a part is commonly that which they directly affect<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Par. XLIX.</NOTE>; so the powers, which are employed as remedies, in order that their general effect may reach the whole body with the more certainty, should be, <HI>in the same manner,</HI> differently applied to different parts.</P>
<P>CCCV. The cure of any sthenic disease whatever, is improperly entrusted to bleeding alone, though that is one of the most powerful of the debilitating remedies. And the reason is, that, though the excitability is sufficiently reduced <HI>by that remedy</HI> in the greater blood-vessels, per∣haps too much, yet in the extremities of these, as well as in the rest of the body, it is not sufficiently reduced<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The action of every exciting power, whether salutary or hurtful, or curative, always extends over the whole body, the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat of ex∣citability, but still with the inequality mentioned in the fourth Chapter of Part First. This is the basis of the distinction with respect to the pre∣sent subject: which is, that, as every power acts most effectually on the part where its action is immediately exerted, it is better to trust to a number, every one of which possesses that advantage, than rely on any one, however powerful otherwise; as by that means, whatever be the indication, whether it be to encrease or diminish excitement, the effect will be more equally produced over all in consequence of there being a number of parts that have had a strong action exerted upon them.</NOTE>.
<PB N="194" REF="022373_0208_0FB867D361F603F8"/>
Nor is the alternation of bleeding with purging a perfect sort of cure; because, though the excessive excitement be sufficiently, and more than sufficiently, removed in the greater blood-vessels, and in the innumerable small arteries, whether exhalant or mucous, which discharge their fluids into the intestines; yet, neither on the perspiratory ter∣minations of the arteries, nor on the rest of the body, is an equal debilitating energy exerted: for instance, the small vessels which open into the stomach, are not suffici∣ently relieved of their distending<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">and therefore stimulating load, the stimulus in any vessel being the quantity of its fluid.</NOTE> load. And although vo∣miting<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCLXIX.</NOTE>, which has been improperly left out of the cure of sthenic diseases, and <HI>still more</HI> improperly employed in <HI>every one of</HI> the asthenic, should be conjoined with the two remedies just now mentioned, even that would not be e∣nough to produce an equality of diminished excitement; as there would still remain in the perspiratory vessels, the same state of the excitement, which has been mentioned, as in the rest of the body, that is not vascular. In vio∣lent sthenic diseases, therefore, after diminishing the dia∣thesis, and in the slighter from the beginning <HI>of the dis∣ease,</HI> the addition of <HI>the operation of</HI> sweat to the evacuations that have been spoken of, will produce a more equal di∣minution of excitement, a more perfect solution of the disease. For by means of this evacuation, not only from the larger blood-vessels, in the interior parts of the body, but from an infinity of outlets both of the external, and
<PB N="195" REF="022373_0209_0FB867D504671728"/>
internal surface of the body, an immense quantity of flu∣ids, every where distending, and, <HI>thereby,</HI> producing a ve∣ry great sun of excitement, is withdrawn. But the mat∣ter stops not even here. For, since in slight sthenic affecti∣ons much nourishing food, and in them all, too much, can be taken; the consequence of that must be, that, however much the quantity of the blood and other fluids has been diminished, if the food, which is the only <HI>power</HI> that can produce blood, continues to be taken, all the vessels, in proportion to the quantity that has been taken, will a∣gain go on to be filled, and to be fired with the fewel of excessive excitement. To prevent which inconvenience, and to diminish excitement, still with greater equality over the system; abstinence, or an allowance of vegetable mat∣ter in a fluid form, and watery drink, will have a very great effect. But neither does the matter end here. For, if, after taking all the precautions and securities that have been recommended, the degree of heat, that proves hurt∣ful from its stimulus, be allowed to approach the external surface of the body; it will produce another inequality of excitement, however much that may have been properly and equally diminished by the other means of cure. Where∣fore, as the sthenic diathesis depends so much upon the sti∣mulus of heat, directly affecting the skin<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See par. CXIII.</NOTE>, and is, on that account, prevalent in the skin in preference to other parts; to make sure of rendering the diminution of excite∣ment as equal as possible, the debilitating effect of cold should be opposed to the high degree of excitement, which the heat has produced. When, at last, all the <HI>directions,</HI> which have been so fully pointed out, have been executed, <HI>still</HI> to re∣produce the equality of excitement, suited to good health; it remains, that we be on our guard against the stimuli that arise from the intellectual functions and passions. For,
<PB N="196" REF="022373_0210_0FB867D9567CBAA8"/>
as they have a great effect in producing sthenic diathesis<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See par. CXXXVIIII.

If the cure of sthenic diseases hitherto has consisted in bleeding, purging of the belly, and in the use of refrigeration in a few cases; and, if the other ob∣jects of attention, which have now been so fully treated of, have either been totally neglected, or mentioned in a slight way, by the by, and as if they had been of no consequence, and, in the cures which were prescribed in that way, not reduced to any principle; it will easily <HI>now</HI> appear, from what has been said above, and in other parts of this work, how much the knowledge of those diseases has been im∣proved, both in the practical and reasoning part: and it will now, at last, be found a certain and established fact, that both the nature and true theory of sthenic dis∣eases, as well as the practice of the cure of them, consi∣dered either as an art and imitative, or as rational and scientific, has been discovered and demonstrated.</P>
<P>CCCVII. As the debilitating or antisthenic<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">See par. XC.</NOTE> reme∣dies are the same with the asthenic hurtful powers<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See par.

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And as the remedies of asthenic diathesis, to whate∣ver part they are applied, also stimulate that part more <HI>than</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="022373_0211_0FB867DB779B2350"/>
any other; some of them one, others another part, <HI>and</HI> encrease the excitement:</P>
<P>CCCVIII. So, in asthenic diseases, <HI>if we want</HI> to rouse the excitement with more equality, and restore the <HI>lost</HI> strength, we must not depend upon the most diffusible sti∣muli alone<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCI.</NOTE>. For, while they indeed encrease the ex∣citement over the whole body, at the same time, they produce that effect in the stomach with greater force <HI>than any where else.</HI> Hence, even from the beginning of the cure, when almost no food can be taken, and other durable and more natural stimuli<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">as that of pure air, exercise, the stimulus of the motion of the blood and other fluids in their respective vessels.</NOTE> are most imperfectly applied; yet, together with the diffusibles, soups<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCII.</NOTE> should be given, and as much haste as possible should be made to bring the patient to take solid meat, while care, at the same time, should be taken to apply a proper degree of heat. For, by this method, we most properly secure both the internal and external surface. Nay, in the same way, we move that inanition of the vessels which takes place in asthenic diseases in an exact proportion to their degree. For, as in that abundance of blood, which is the most powerful means of bringing on sthenic diseases, there is an opportunity of making a quick cure by immediate taking of blood; so it is only by insensible, gradual, im∣perceptible, and obscure successive steps, that we open the access to the removal of that penury of blood, which proves the most hurtful power in asthenic diseases, and effect the filling of the vessels again.</P>
<P>CCCIX. After this management of both surfaces of the body, and this partial filling of the vessels; still the excitement is not, equally enough encreased. To effect this further in part; at the same time some most diffusi∣ble
<PB N="198" REF="022373_0212_0FB867DC91820A58"/>
stimulus, suppose any preparation of opium, should be administered, and the little animal food, <HI>or meat,</HI> that there is any appetite for, and that can be taken and di∣gested, should be added. The idea of giving food is evi∣dent from the latter explanation given about soups<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCVIII.</NOTE>. But, the use of the more durable, and less diffusible, sti∣mulus depends on this, "that when the excitability is worn out by any one stimulus, any new stimulus finds ex∣citability, and draws it forth, and thereby produces a further variation of the effect.</P>
<P>CCCX. Hitherto the stimulus of the motion, by which all the muscles, which, from their situation on the sur∣face of the body, by their contractions propel the blood along the veins to the heart, are thrown into action, has not been supplied<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See par CVXXXII. α. β. γ. δ. CCLXXIII. CCCIII.</NOTE>; and, therefore, both upon account of the emptiness of the vessels, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low circulation from the want of that impulse, the excitement is not sufficiently aroused over all that tract. After the strength has, then, been so recruited, that rich food can now be taken, the body can now be roused, first by foreign, then by its own organs, of which the former is called gestation, the latter exercise, and also refreshed by air; <HI>when all that has happened,</HI> then it is, that the excitement is further rai∣sed in several points, and becomes more equal upon the whole.</P>
<P>CCCXI. The last stimuli to be mentioned, which, <HI>along with those already mentioned,</HI> have a natural tenden∣cy to produce an equalization of excitement over the whole system, arise from the action of the mind, the energy of passion or emotion, and a still greater purity of air, than is attainable by persons shut up in a room<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See and compare with these last mentioned stimuli the following paragraphs CCLXXV. CCCLXXVIII. CCLXXIX. π.</NOTE>. In this

The convalescence, from the general effects upon the constitution sometimes arising from local diseases, is to be explained upon the principles laid down, with respect to the two other cases of convalescence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCXII. The stimulant plan of cure, in all its parts, is new, whether the reasoning part, or the merely practi∣cal be regarded; and, whether the cause and the exci∣citing hurtful powers, or the indication of cure and the remedies, be considered. May it, therefore, be put as a question, whether the whole doctrine, which has hitherto been delivered, has, at last, brought forward clear proof, that the art of medicine, hitherto conjectural<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Celsus says, ars nostra conjecturalis est. And every man of sense, whether of the profession, or out of it, has held the same sentiments of it. Nothing is more glaring than the contractions in medical writings and reasoning of every kind, nothing ever could be more incoherent. If a piece of knowledge, that sets out with a fixed principle, which applies to all the parts of the detail, while they reflect on it, both illustration and confirmation, be entitled to be considered as a science, the reader is desired to consider, how far that criterion will apply to this doctrine. The pedantry of mathematicians has contributed as much to bring their science into disgrace, as any other circumstance, particularly in allowing no sort of probation, but that which is made out by lines and diagrams; while, except the elements of that science, every application of that de∣partment of knowledge has led to as many false conclusions as any other. If they will not allow the proof, that arises from our feelings, compared with those of all men, whose organs of sense are not deranged, what will they make of their own axioms?

<P>CCCXII. AS it is sound certain, and proved, that the common effect of all the exciting powers is precisely the same, to wit, the production of the phoenomena peculiar to life, that is, that sense, motion, intellectual operation, and passion and emotion, are the same; for what else is the ef∣fect of heat, of food, of seasoned food, of drink, of the blood, of the colourless fluids secreted from it, and of the air, among external bodies; what else in the functions of the living body itself, is the effect of muscular contraction, of thought, of the passions, and of sensation, but to excite, preserve, and continue as the sustaining cause of those functions in common to animals? And, as it is from that evident, that the operation of all the same powers is also the same; (for it must be granted, that the same cause by an universal law in nature, tends to the same effect<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See par.

<HEAD>That all the Powers, which support any Sort of Life, are the same, or the fundamental Principle of Agriculture,</HEAD>
<P>CCCXV. AGAIN, are not the powers, which produce perfect health, the same as those, which, by an excess of force, produce sthenic diseases; by a deficiency of force, asthenic, as well as the predispositions to both, are they not the same, with no other variation but that of de∣gree<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See XXIII. LXXIII.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>CCCXVI.

XC. XCI. XCII. XCIV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCXVII. All the powers, therefore, that support any state of life, are the same in kind, only varying in de∣gree; and the proposition is true, of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of life, to its full extent over the animal creation.</P>
<P>Such is the life of animals<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See from X. to XIII. inclusive.</NOTE>. Concerning which, all that has been said applies to the life of vegetables.</P>
<P>CCCXVIII. Accordingly, as animals, in every state of life, have their exciting powers<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See LXII. LXVII. LXVIII. LXIX. LXXIII.

<P><PB N="203" REF="022373_0217_0FB867EA03F974C0"/>
CCCXIX. The powers that support plants, in every state of life, are heat, air, moisture, light, some motion, and their internal juices.</P>
<P>CCCXX. The action of plants also consists in stimu∣lus<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See XVII XIX. and notes.</NOTE>; by means of which, the phoenomena peculiar to that sort of life, sense, some motion, and verdure, are ex∣cited: and the cause of this state is excitement, an effect in common to all exciting powers<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">See Part I. Chap. II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCXXI. Nay, in this case too the exciting powers, when applied in due proportion, produce health; but their too great or too sparing <HI>action</HI> occasions diseases, or pre∣disposition to diseases; of which the former depend on an excessive, the latter upon a deficiency of stimulus. Ac∣cordingly, excess or scantiness of moisture, excessive heat or cold, by an equality of <HI>hurtful</HI> operation, lead to dis∣ease and death, indirectly or directly. And, as the rays of the sun or darkness, when their operation is either too great, or too long continued, prove debilitating, the for∣mer indirectly, the latter directly; so the alternate suc∣cession of night to day, of darkness to night, seems to be the effect of an intention in nature, to prevent too great an effulgence of the light of day, or too long a continuance of it, from stimulating either in excess or in ultimate excess, and thereby inducing sthenic diseases, or those of indirect debility; or to prevent an excess, or long continuance of darkness from producing direct debility, and the diseases pe∣culiar to it<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Chap. IV. We have no less proof, than that of the universal feel∣ing of mankind, of the truth of what has been advanced, with respect to the stimulus of light and the debilitating effect of darkness.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCXXII. Nor do plants want their excitability, which, equally as in animals, <Q>is not different in diffe∣rent parts of its seat; nor is made up of parts, but one
<PB N="204" REF="022373_0218_0FB867EC44A0CC98"/>
uniform, undivided, property over the whole system<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">See Part I Chap. IV.</NOTE>.</Q> The effect of which is, that, to whatever part of a plant any exciting power is applied, its operation, whether in excess, in due proportion, or in under-proportion, im∣mediately affects the excitability over the whole.</P>
<P>CCCXXIII. This effect is also produced with the same inequality as in animals, being, for instance, greater in any part to which its exciting power is directly applied, than in any other equal part. And, as there are two reasons for that fact in animals, the direct impression of the pow∣er upon the part more affected, and a greater energy of the excitability of <HI>a part or relation to which it is so applied,</HI> than on that of any other equal part<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See XLIX. and addition L. LI.</NOTE>; the very same is the fact with respect to plants. Further, as the exci∣tability bears a greater relation to the impression of the <HI>exciting</HI> powers, on the brain, the stomach, and inte∣stines, than on any of most of the other parts; so the part in plants, that corresponds to these parts, is the root, which is affected in the highest degree by the exciting powers. It is the root of plants, in preference to any of their other parts, to which the conflux of moisture is made. The heat there is the best, which is neither ex∣cessive, and therefore liable to produce sthenic affection, nor ultimately excessive, and therefore ready to induce in∣direct debility (both which disadvantages are prevented by the depth <HI>of the ground</HI>); nor deficient, or what is called cold, which would bring on direct debility<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Hence it would appear, that it should be a general rule in plough∣ing and harrowing to adapt the depth, where the seed is to be laid, to the state of the surrounding temperature. It would seem, when other circumstances are equal, that the seeds of plants may more safely lye su∣perficially in warm than in cold countries. The same fact seems to be favoured by the difference of perfection that planted and natural woods attain in cold countries; the former, the seeds of which are lodged in a certain depth, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rning to better account than the latter, which rise from seeds that have randomly been scattered upon the surface. Might not the hills in the west of Scotland, upon some such principle, be made use∣ful oak forests?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCXXIV. But the only use of the soil, through the pores of which the powers that have been mentioned pe∣netrate,
<PB N="205" REF="022373_0219_0FB867EE15DC4488"/>
is to furnish that sort of a strainer, by which the powers may neither, from the pores being too patulous, go down in too great quantity, and produce first a sthenic, or too luxuriant a state of the plant, and then indirect de∣bility; nor, from the contractedness of the pores, be in∣sufficiently admitted to the root, and occasion indirect debility, or the decaying state of a plant But that the soil is not otherwise necessary to the <HI>production of</HI> some <HI>de∣gree of</HI> vegetable life, is proved by plants often living, to a certain degree, in pure water. That, however, it is useful as a filter, is proved by the good effect of ploughing, of braking the clods, of dividing the tough clay by lime and other absorbent earths, and by these means relaxing the pores: <HI>On the other hand, we have proof of the same thing</HI> in the success of contracting the pores by making ground, <HI>naturally</HI> too friable, more tenacious with dung, and covering light ground with rags and stones, and there∣by keeping in both heat and moisture.</P>
<P>CCCXXV. From this <HI>view of the facts,</HI> the reason is evident, why every sandy as well as clay soil, when the former has not received, and the latter parted with its toughness, is barren and unfruitful. Hence it is, that very hot summers and countries are hurtful to clay grounds, by shutting up the pores; and serviceable to friable and lean grounds, by diminishing their porosity. Hence, dry sea∣sons are suitable to low-lying rich grounds, which, from all quarters, conduct a quantity of moisture around the roots of the plants; while rainy seasons are those that an∣swer in grounds that are high and of a thin soil. Declivi∣ties facing the north, which are commonly of a thin and poor soil, are cherished and protected by hedges and clumps
<PB N="206" REF="022373_0220_0FB867F0C1B8A4B0"/>
of trees, and a great number of bare stones, covering every thing, which some persons, of more industry than sense, often remove with hurtful effect; their good effect being to give heat and keep in moisture. But in those places, the declivity of which looks towards the south, there is not equal occasion for such <HI>protection from cold</HI> and dryness, as they, from their more happy situation, are cherished by the sun, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended from the cold winds, and exposed to those which blow from the southern points that are seldom too dry<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">While the northern winds, that is, the wind due north, and all the intermediate ones in every point of the compass from due east to due west, are cold and dry, and commonly of a tendency to bring snow; the southern, or the winds that blow from any point of the compass towards the south, from the same points of due east to due west, are as common∣ly warm and moist, and often productive of mild fertilizing rains.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCXXVI. To return, <HI>from this digression on agricul∣ture,</HI> to our proper subject; from what has been said upon cultivation and nature of plants, we learn, that their life is similar to that of animals; that every thing vital in na∣ture is governed by excitement, which the exciting pow∣ers only afford; that there is in no living, system, whe∣ther <HI>of the</HI> animal or vegetable <HI>kind,</HI> any inherent power necessary to the preservation of life; that the same powers which form life at first, and afterwards support it, have at last a tendency to produce its dissolution; that life, the prolongation of life, its decay and death, are <HI>all states</HI> equally natural; that every living system lives in that which procreates; that the generations of animals and ve∣getables are in that way renewed, that <HI>the system of</HI> nature remains, and maintains an eternal vigour; in one word, that all the phoenomena of nature are fabricated by one single organ<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">No discovery, of any importance or extent over nature, has yet been made, that does not warrant, as far as the smallness of the number of such discoveries go, the truth of this assertion.

<P><PB N="207" REF="022373_0221_0FB867F4E335A430"/>
There are many circumstances that give reason to believe, that this globe has undergone great changes, and that whatever is now sea, has been land; what∣ever is land at present, has been sea; and that the fos∣sil <HI>kingdom of nature</HI> has not been more retentive of the respective form of each of its individuals. But whether the last, like animals and plants, have a sort life, so as, after their manner, to be produced into living existence, to grow, to run through a period equally with∣out growth and diminution of bulk, to decay, to die, and, in death lose their proper form; the great duration of their age, and the shortness of ours, deprive us of any possibi∣lity of learning.</P>
<P>CCCXXVII. As all the motions of the planets, which latter were formed to remain and continue their courses for ever, depend upon this one principle, to proceed straight onward, according to the manner in which all projectiles move, and then by the influence of gravity, which affects them all, to be pulled downwards, and thereby, upon the whole, thrown into circular motions; so, in the lesser and living bodies with which those greater bodies are filled, that is, animals and plants, of which the whole species remain though the individuals of each species die; whatever is the cause of their functions, whatever gives commencement and perfection to these, the same weakens, and, at last, ex∣tinguishes them. It is not, therefore, true, that some pow∣ers are contrived by nature for <HI>the preservation of</HI> life and health, others to bring on diseases and death. The ten∣dency of them all is indeed to support life, but in a forced way, and then to bring on death, but by a spontaneous operation.</P>

<P>CCCXXXI. The phlemasiae and exanthematic disea∣ses have the following symptoms in common to them. The first of these is that degree of sthenic diathesis, that distinguishes predisposition<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">From the first deviation from perfect health to the commence∣ment of actual sthenic disease, the sthenic diathesis takes place in an en∣creasing scale from 40° to 55°.</NOTE>.

It had been asserted, by most systematics and all the nosologists, that the primary symptom in the phlegmasiae was the inflam∣mation of a part, I saw that was not true with respect to rheumatism, in which the general affection or pyrexia often rages one, two, or three days before the sign of inflammation, pain, is perceived in any of the joints. I could also discern, that from the moment the pain and inflam∣mation appeared in erysipelas, or the rose, there was also the general af∣fection equally conspicuous. In short, in no one of that set of diseases, did the fact appear that the inflammation was primary, and the pyrexia, or affection of the whole system dependent upon it. But as peripneu∣mony was said in Edinburgh to be an exception, the detection I made equally disproved that. In all the works of Morgagni, where perineu∣mony and erysipelas are treated, and in all those of Trillerus, a professed writer on that subject, and in a thesis in Sandiforth's Thesaurus, taken from no less than 400 cases of that disease (for they are now by others, as well as me, considered as one), I found that in somewhat more than one-half of the given n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber, which was very respectable, the general affection appeared from one to three days before the pain came on, and in all the rest of the cases, though for any thing these authors said to the contrary, they might sometimes have come on together, yet, that there was not one, in which it could be fairly alledged, that the pain was the first and primary appearance. Hence I found, that all the theories rais∣ed upon that hypothesis of course fell to the ground. Indeed the fact is quite consistent with every one here.</NOTE>. This general affection, for the greater

convenience of distinguishing it from fevers, is to be de∣nominated pyrexia<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Of this designation warning has been given more than once. See, note at CCCXXIX.</NOTE>.

<P>CCCXXXIV. The frequency of the pulse in sthenic diseases is moderate, because, while the stimulus in the sys∣tem cannot fail to produce some <HI>frequency,</HI> the quantity <HI>of blood,</HI> to be thrown into quick motion, sets bounds to it and prevents its rising into quickness. But, <HI>at the same time,</HI> it is evident, that a quantity <HI>so great</HI> cannot be trans∣mitted with the same celerity, as an under proportion<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">In, fevers and other asthenic diseases of great debility, from the weakness of the stomach and other digestive organs, and the small quan∣tity of nutrient matter taken in, the quantity of blood which is diminish∣ed in every one of those diseases, cannot be more than one-third less than that which overfills the vessels in sthenic diseases. Consequently, by a given power, it may be propelled in the same proportion, that is, one-third faster than in the sthenic diseases, which also appears in fact; for while 100 beats in a minute is a frequent pulse in sthenic diseases, till their approach or actual conversion to indirect debility, the common frequency in fevers and the other high asthenic diseases, is 150 beats in the same time.</NOTE>. The strength of the pulse is occasioned by the degree of ex∣citement in the moving fibres of the vessels, which is com∣monly called their tone, and by that of their density con∣sidered as simple solids<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">See above LIX. LX. and LXI.</NOTE>. The hardness of the sthenic pulse is nothing else, than the continuance for some time of each strong contraction, closely embracing a great co∣lumn of blood, and, thereby, as it were, resembling a stretched rope<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See par. CLV. If it should be alledged, that, though in fevers and the other cases mentioned just now in the note (<HI>a</HI>), the deficient quantity of blood to be put in motion will account for the greater celeri∣ty of motion, than in the diseases which make the present subject; still the great weakness of the heart, for want of the stimulus of a due quan∣tity of blood, as well as of many others, should overbalance the effect arising from the small quantity to be moved. But the answer to that objection is easy. It arises from the explanation of the strength and hardness of the pulse just now mentioned in the text. The febrile pulse is indeed one-third quicker than the sthenic pyrexial, but it is weak, and small, and soft, while the other is strong, and full, and hard. An equal force then of the heart to that in the sthenic case is not required to ac∣count for the difference of the effect. A third less of blood, with an equal force behind, will be driven not only one-third faster, but with strength and hardness. The want of these two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> is to be set to the account of the heart's greater weakness. Though the blood then be driven one-third quicker, yet the impulse communicated upon the whole is one-third less, as the characteristics of both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of pulse readily ex∣plain to us.</NOTE>.</P>

That this is the exact state of the arte∣ries is proved by the great quantity of food taken with a good appetite, before the arrival of the disease, and du∣ring the period of predisposition; it is proved by the same and other powers, giving an unusually great excitement o∣ver the whole system<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See the whole of the first Chapter of Part II, upon the powers producing sthenic diathesis.</NOTE>, and, therefore, among <HI>their</HI> o∣ther effects encreasing the digestive energy; and it is pro∣ved by evacuant, with other debilitating remedies, both preventing and removing the diseases.

<P>CCCXXXVII.

<P>CCCXXXIX. The redness of the urine is owing to the general diathesis affecting the vessels that secrete it, and proving an obstacle to the secretion<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">See par.

But, as, in this forcible action of the vessels, the cohesive force of all the simple solids yields somewhat, <HI>the effect comes to be</HI> the transmission of some particles of blood.

<P>CCCXLII. The inflammation and affection nearly al∣lied to it<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">mentioned above in par.

<P>CCCXLIII. The general affection, for the most part, precedes that confined to one part, or is sunchronous with it, never comes after it, because its cause, the excessive excitement<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See LXII.

Hence, when the diathesis is great, the affec∣tion of the part is in proportion<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">as in peripneumony and rheumatism, inflammatory sore throat, and mild erysipelas, sore throat.</NOTE> and slight under a lesser degree of the diathesis<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">as in the sthenic.</NOTE>; while in a moderate and gentle diathesis it does not happen at all<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">As in synocha, or the common inflammatory fever and catarrh.</NOTE>, and for this reason, that a high degree of diathesis is necessary to the formation of it. Thus in peripneumony, where the diathesis is the greatest, and in rheumatism, where it is next <HI>in greatness,</HI> the inflammation is found proportionably great<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">This proposition does not go so far as to assert, that there may not be a sthenic disease, without any actual inflammation, but with an affec∣tion of a part nearly allied to it, which depends upon an equally high diathesis as either peripneumony or rheumatism, and even higher than the latter. Such we find, as I have formerly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid (CLVII. and CLVIII.) in phrenitis. But the meaning is, that the inflammation, when it does, happen, is always in proportion to the degree of diathesis.</NOTE>. And

even in the measles, the danger of which turns entirely upon the degree of sthenic diathesis, the danger of inflam∣mation is equal, by which, and often in a high degree, the lungs themselves are affected.

Simple synocha is nothing else but a phlegmasia, consisting of a pyrexia and diathesis, inade∣quate, upon account of their small degree, to the produc∣tion of inflammation. Yet, as all the hurtful powers pro∣ducing it, and all its remedies are precisely the same, with those of any phlegmasia; the separating it from them, and uniting it with fevers, which are diseases o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extreme debi∣lity, was an unpardonable blunder<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">This has been more than once hinted at, and once a little above.

For how can any person suppose, that the points of the same vessels, either as distributed upon the membrane, or plunging into the substance of the lungs, or emerging from it, can alone be inflamed without <HI>a communication of the affection</HI> to the next points<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Yet one Nosologist, upon that very supposition, makes two orders of phlegmasiae, one seated on the membrane, the other in the interior surface of each viscus. Into this error, he had been led, by observing, that, after death, the interior substance of the liver exhibited signs of previous inflammation. And, as other dissections showed the membrane upon other occasions to have been in a state of inflammation, he thence drew his rash conclusion. But it is to be observed, that the first menti∣oned state of the liver was not a phlegmasiae at all, as it had not during life exhibited any of the symptoms of that disease, or even given any sign of the presence of inflammation. It is a case, then, we have nothing to do with upon this subject, even so far as it applies to the liver. But the extending the application to all the viscera, which he was pleased to make the seats of some phlegmasiae or other, was looseness of reasoning, and carelessness of matter of fact, in extreme. A gentleman, whose works have lately been buried, without any struggle or signs of life, but that of a feeble unintelligible sound from within the tomb, which no living reason could make any sense of in their life time, took it into his head to maintain (for the sake of seeming to differ with men of name and reputation, his highest ambition), that the inflammation in the phleg∣masiae was always seated in the membrane: The answer to which is given in the text.</NOTE>. The distinction, there∣fore,

<P>CCCLIV. The difficult breathing is owing to no fault in the lungs, as an organ, to no defect of excitement in them, but to the air alone in inspiration, by filling and distending its own, compressing the inflamed vessels.</P>

<P>CCCLVII. <HI>Again,</HI> the cough is afterwards followed by expectoration; because the accumulated fluids, with their effect, the effort of coughing, are carried forward in the rapid action of the air rushing out, as it were, in a tor∣rent<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See above par.

inflammation, to be considered as of any consequence in pointing out the state or seat of the inflammation: because, however great the inflammation is, wherever it is seated, whatever danger it denounces, the only means of remo∣ving it, and of averting the danger, is to remove the gene∣ral diathesis. The notion, therefore, of the membrane being inflamed, when the pain is acute, and the interior substance, when it is obtuse, must be rejected as good for nothing, must be guarded against as destructive<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">See par CCCL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and the note under it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>).</NOTE>. For often, when the disease has arrived at an advanced stage, a sudden abatement of the pain taking place, without a pro∣portional relief of the breathing, to an unskilful person gives an appearance of a return of health. But the cause of that, while it has nothing to do with the seat or sort of inflammation, is that degree of excitement, which shows, that the excitability is exhausted, the excitement come to an end, and that the vigour, before excessive, is now con∣verted into direct or indirect debility<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">The direct debility may be owing to the proper cure, which is directly debilitating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the indirect de∣bility arising in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the disease, seldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>pharmac treatment. See above par. XLVII. and the subjoined notes.</NOTE>. Hence arises in the vessels, especially the labouring vessels, in place of the excessive excitement, <HI>with which they were before affected,</HI> no excitement at all; and extreme laxity takes place of their former density. Hence, instead of an excretion en∣creased by violence, an immense discharge takes place without force, without effort, <HI>and merely</HI> by the watery <HI>part of the</HI> fluid, from the inert state of the vessels, leaving the more consistent; and a sudden suffocation takes place, in consequence of an effusion of fluids from all quarters in∣to the air vessels.</P>

<HEAD>An Explanation of the Sthenic Exanthemata.</HEAD>
<P>CCCLXVI. The sthenic exanthemata, after the ap∣plication of a contagious matter, and of the usual hurt∣ful powers which produce sthenic diathesis, appear first in the form of a sthenic pyrexia, or synocha, and then after a space of time, not certain to a nicety, are followed with small or larger spots.</P>
<P>CCCLXVII. That the exanthematic sthenic diseases differ not from the other sthenic diseases <HI>not exanthematic,</HI>
<PB N="228" REF="022373_0242_0FB8682AE52579C8"/>
in any circumstance of consequence, is proved by this strong argument; that, except the eruption and the phoenomena peculiar to it, there is nothing in the symptoms, and ex∣cept the contagion, there is nothing in the hurtful exci∣ting powers, but what happens in any sthenic disease; and the preventatives, as well as the remedies, are the same <HI>in all.</HI> While that is the state of the fact, it was the height of absurdity, <HI>merely </HI> for the sake of the eruption and its peculiar phoenomena, to separate the exanthematic from their kindred diseases, and to unite them with the most opposite diseases both to them and to one another<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><P>The nosologists have separated the exanthematic diseases, real or imaginary, into a class or order by themselves, which they have filled up with diseases, of which there is not two, but the small-pox and mea∣sles, that have any other connection, than their m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eruptive appear∣ance, while they are separated from others, with which, in every respect, they have the most essential connection. Thus the small-pox and mea∣sles are taken from the natural place to which they are here restored. And it is unaccountable, that we should have it to say, that even erysi∣pelas, which has surely no right even to the slim distinction of eruptive, has also been placed among them. Again, the plague, which is to all in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents and purposes a typhus fever, its eruptive part not always disjoin∣ing it from that, is separated from it, though it is so nearly the same, scarcely excepting degree, and conjoined with sthenic diseases of a dia∣metrically opposite nature. And the gangrenous sore-throat, which is also a typhus, has neither been placed among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evers, in its proper place, nor among the exanthemata; to which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that it produ∣ces on the external surface according to their own rules of arrangement, seemed better to entitle it than some others, especially the erysipelas. And it again for there is no end of the confusion of this pretended or∣der of some physicians<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, is conjoined not only as a genus with sthenic diseases, but even as a species of one of those genera. The truth is, that systemati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, who were otherwise no nosologists, have made too much work about eruptive and contagious diseases, and have never dived into the interior nature either o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them or almost of any other. They have all followed each other from their first leader, and never once deigned to turn a glance of their eye upon the phoenomena of nature as these arose before them. Hippocrates misled his followers, they misled theirs from age to age, and they all misled the poor nosologists. Who have laid on the cap-stone of the absurdity of the art, and, having finished the fabric of folly, left mankind, if they are not pleased with it, to look out at their leisure for a better and more solid.</P></NOTE>. For
<PB N="229" REF="022373_0243_0FB8682DD63FEC40"/>
how, when the usual plan of cure removes the effect of the eruption, whatever that be, and thereby shows it to be the same, can any one imagine, that the cause should be different and not precisely the same? unless we must again have to do with those who maintain, that the same effect may flow from different causes. Truly, the operation of contagion, in so far as it affects general disease, is not of an opposite nature to the general sthenic operation, but precisely the same.</P>
<P>CCCLXVIII. Contagion is a certain matter, im∣perceptible, of an unknown nature, and like most of the phoenomena of nature, only in any measure open to our enquiry in its evident effects. Taken from the body of one affected with it, or from any gross matter (such as clothes or furniture, where it happens to have been lur∣king), and received into a sound body, it ferments without any change of the solids or fluids, it fills all the vessels, and then is gradually ejected by the pores.</P>
<P>CCCLXIX. And, as no effect, except sthenic diathe∣sis, follows it, and the hurtful powers, that otherwise u∣sually produce that diathesis, always precede it, and an asthenic or debilitating plan of cure always, and only, suc∣ceeds <HI>in removing it,</HI> and consequently its effect no ways differs from the diseases hitherto mentioned; it is, there∣fore, with justice, that the diseases arising from it, are con∣joined with those others, as belonging to the same form.</P>
<P>CCCLXX. Betwixt them there is only this difference, that in the exanthematic cases of sthenic disease, the mat∣ter requires some time to pass out of the body, <HI>which time is</HI> different in different cases: and it passes out more copious∣ly

or scantily, the more free or impeded the perspiration is<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See above par. XXI. and LXXVI.</NOTE>. But it is impeded by no spasm, by no constriction from cold, and only by the prevalence of sthenic diathesis upon the surface of the body; as is evident from this fact that cold, by its debilitating operation, procuring a free is∣sue for the matter, clearly promotes the perspiration<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See par. CXVII. CXVIII. CXX. CXXI.</NOTE>. And that it produces this effect, by diminishing the diathe∣sis, not by removing a spasm, has been demonstrated for∣merly.

<P>CCCLXXII. The period of eruption is more or less certain, because the operation of fermentation, being in some measure certain and uniform, to that extent re∣quires a certain uniform <HI>space of </HI> time, for being finished, diffused over the system, and reaching the surface of it, as is attested by the effect.

<P>CCCLXXIII. The pyrexia, symptomatic of the e∣ruption, sometimes takes on the form of an actual fever: The reason of which is, that the high degree of stimulus, which the eruption throws upon the whole surface, produces

<HEAD>The Description of the violent Small-pox.</HEAD>
<P>CCCLXXIV. The violent small-pox is a sthenic exan∣thema, on the third or fourth day of which, sometimes latter, small spots or points, inflamed, and by and by to be transformed into exact pustules, break out; containing a liquor <HI>which,</HI> generally on the eighth day after the erup∣tion, often latter, is changed into pus, and dwindles away in the form of crusts.

<P>CCCLXXV. All these phoenomena are governed by the laws of fermentation, lately mentioned<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See above par. CCCLXVIII.</NOTE>. The num∣ber of pustules, being proportioned to the degree of diathe∣sis, shows that, without the hurtful powers, that otherwise, <HI>and without any co-operation of contagious matter,</HI> produce that diathesis, the contagion has not much effect in produ∣cing the real morbid s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, and that it chiefly regulates the exterior form the disease<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Which, without diathesis, is of no consequence, and does not a∣mount to general morbid s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>The Description of the violent Measles.</HEAD>
<P>CCCLXXVII. The violent measles is a sthenic exan∣thematic disease<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See above par. CCCLXVI.</NOTE>, beginning with sneezing, watery eyes,
<PB N="232" REF="022373_0246_0FB86836CB1B9120"/>
dry cough, and hoarseness; on the fourth day of which, or later, there appears an eruption of small numerous pa∣pulae or little points; that on the third day, or later, terminate in an appearance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> branny scales. This dis∣ease, when preceded with a high degree of sthenic diathesis, is proportionally violent.</P>
<P>CCCLXXVIII. The sneezing, watery eyes, dry cough, and hoarseness, are catarrhal symptoms, and, there∣fore, depend upon sthenic diathesis<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">See above par. CLXXV.</NOTE>. And, since they appear, four days or more, before the eruption, that is, before the matter might seem to have reached the affected parts, and are constant and universal; hence are we to suppose, that the sthenic diathesis follows the hurtful powers, that usually produce it, and not entirely the pecu∣liar matter in this case, and that it is indispensably neces∣sary to the measles. But though that <HI>supposition</HI> should be rejected, and it should be contended, that those symptoms arise from the <HI>contagious</HI> matter; it still must be granted, that this disease differs, however, in nothing from the other sthenic diseases, but equally depends upon sthenic diathesis, and yields to antisthenic or debilitating remedies. And it must be allowed, that, since the matter produces the same affect as the usual hurtful powers, its operation must be absolutely the same, <HI>and</HI> the cause of the disease the same. Consequently, we find nothing in the indica∣tion of cure, but what is in common to this disease with other sthenic exanthematic ones, which is, that time must be given to the matter to pass out of the body, and the perspiration be conducted in the same manner, as the sthenic diathesis is usually treated upon other occasions<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See above par. XCVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCLXXIX. The eruption admits of the same rea∣soning that has been delivered<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">See above par. CCCLXXV.</NOTE>. The circumstance
<PB N="233" REF="022373_0247_0FB8683A0D931CE8"/>
of its being a violent disease when preceded by a violent sthenic diathesis, and mild in a degree of that dia∣thesis, is a further instance of the little difference that there is betwixt the operation of contagion, and that of the or∣dinary powers producing sthenic diathesis.</P>
<P>CCCLXXX. When the diathesis runs so high as to suppress the perspiration, the eruption often disappears for a time, as if it went into the interior parts of the body: Which is a danger, that is chiefly threatened at the end of the disease; and shows, that this matter, in the same manner as the variolous, kindles up a symptomatic in∣flammation over the surface of the body, and then, by a further encrease of the diathesis, suppresses the perspira∣tion. Hence, with other viscera, the lungs<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">That the lungs should be inflamed in a violent state of the diathe∣sis in the measles is not to be wondered at; as the common catarrh, when its diathesis runs high, is liable to produce the same effect. (See par. CCCXLIII▪ towards the end.) But, considering how many facts in medical writings I have found false, the effect of that on my mind, is to render the weight of testimony in favour of the various internal visce∣ra being so liable to be inflamed, from this supposed striking in of the measly eruption, very light, and to dispose me to doubt of the fact alto∣gether: Which I am the more inclined to do, from the analogy of a broad fact in direct contradiction to it: Which is, that the inflamma∣tion, depending upon the general diathesis in sthenic diseases, never, as I have yet found, affects an interior part. (See par. CXIII. CLXVIII.) Neither is inflammation, from any other source, near so frequent in inter∣nal parts as vulgar opinion has taught us. Dissection has shown inflam∣mation in the intestinal canal in dysentery, or what is called in English the bloody flux. But that only happened under the evacuant, debilita∣ting, vegetable, plan of cure: and, even in that case, seems to have been an ultimate, not an early, effect, much less a cause. And it has been shown, that what has been considered as a burning inflammation in the first passages, is not an inflammation at all. (See above par. CXCVIII.) Nay, even when inflammation does happen internally, it is never of the sthenic, but always of the general, or local, asthenic kind, and, when quickly cured, cannot be inflammation. If there be any truth in the frequency of inflammation towards the end of the measles, it must be of the asthenic kind: Which is the more likely from its late appearance, and from a circumstance that, though no where taken notice of, has great weight with me; which is, that as the distinct small pox passes in∣to the confluent, peripneumony into dropsy of the chest, and any sthenic disease with its diathesis, into any asthenic disease, and the diathesis on which it depends; there is nothing in the nature of the animal oecono∣my and of the powers acting on it, to prevent the same conversion of sthenic into asthenic state in the measles. And if, which is most proba∣ble from the alexipharmac practice, that was then used in this disease, indirect debility can induce such a change, no disease has a fuller chance for it than the measles. But I am sure, were the debilitating plan used from the beginning, no such consequence would happen.</NOTE> are often inflamed.</P>

CCCLXXXI. The violent state of the small-pox, of∣ten from the great stimulus of the eruption, converts both the sthenic diathesis and eruption into the asthenic ones, and thereby produces the confluent small-pox, of which we are afterwards to treat. Whether any thing like that is the consequence of the measles, is not yet ascertained: But, as every excess of excitement, as in the conversion of peripneumony into a dropsy of the chest, is liable to run into indirect debility, it is, therefore, scarce to be doubt∣ed, but that the same thing happens to this disease, which is inferior to none in violence.</P>

<P>CCCLXXXII. The violent Erysipelas is a phlegmasia, always beginning with pyrexia, and followed by inflam∣mation. The inflammation is seated in some external part of the body, oftenest in the face, sometimes in the throat, with redness, of an unequal edge, somewhat raised, creep∣ing from one place to another, and attended with a sense of burning.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="022373_0249_0FB8683D46090F28"/>
CCCLXXXIII. It is peculiar to this inflammation, and foreign from the other general ones, to invade the corpus mucosum. To assign a reason for which is of no consequence; since this inflammation does not differ from the others either in the operation of the exciting powers pro∣ducing it, or in that of the remedies which remove it.</P>
<P>CCCLXXXIV. The cause of the redness of the in∣flammation, in this as well as in every case, is an excessive quantity of blood in the inflamed vessels; for the question about the degree of redness is of no importance. There is less swelling in the inflamed part, <HI>than in other sthenic inflammations,</HI> because there is <HI>here</HI> a free space betwixt the scarf-skin and true skin, allowing the effused humour room to spread and diffuse itself. The same is the cause of the slow motion of the inflammation, and of the ine∣quality of its edges. The sense of burning is owing to an acrimony <HI>of the contained fluid,</HI> acquired by stagnation.</P>
<P>CCCLXXXV. The attack of the inflammation upon the face is not more dangerous than upon any other place, except when the diathesis, upon which it depends, is great, rendering the inflammation proportionally great<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See par. LXXXV. CCCXLIII.</NOTE>. In which latter case, whatever part is inflamed, the disease must be held for a severe one; but still severer, if the in∣flammation seizes the face; in which case a great tumult of affection internally accompanies the disease.</P>
<P>CCCLXXXVI. When such a sthenic diathesis, and affection of the head depending on it, happens, no disease is more dangerous, none more rapid in its race to death; while in a mild diathesis no disease is milder.</P>

<HEAD>A Discription of Rheumatism.</HEAD>
<P>CCCLXXXVII. Rheumatism is a phlegmasia, es∣pecially in that temperament, which inclines to the san∣guine.

It is a conseqence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat succeeding to cold, or so alternating with it as to prove the more stimulant: It is accompanied with pain nigh, or between, the joints, chiefly the greater ones, and proportioned to the degree of the diathesis<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">CCCXLIII.</NOTE>: And the inflammation always comes after the pyrexia.</P>
<P>CCCLXXXVIII. External temperature is hurtful in this disease in the same way, as it has been often now ex∣plained<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">CXIII. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCLXXXIX. The rage of the pain is in the parts that have been mentioned<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">CLXVIII.</NOTE>, because it is in these parts that the inflammation, or more encreased part of the gene∣ral diathesis<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bid.</NOTE>, chiefly acts. Which <HI>again</HI> happens, for this reason, that the nearly most powerful of the exciting hurtful causes, the temperature, that has been mentioned<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">CXIII.</NOTE>, is only directed thither. There is no translation of the inflammation to the internal parts, for this reason, that these parts, which preserve nearly an equal temperature amidst every change of it externally, are not acted upon by the same hurtful power <HI>which annoys the external parts.</HI></P>
<P>CCCXC. Cold, according to the common opinion, is not hurtful in this disease; because the rage of the dis∣ease is greatest under the operation of heat, which has an effect quite opposite to that of constriction<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</NOTE>. This fact is confirmed by stimulant diet, <HI>in all its articles,</HI> proving always hurtful, and by abstinence being always servicea∣ble, and often alone making out the cure. And it brings <HI>a sufficient</HI> refutation of that mistaken notion, according to which, temperature is alledged to be more hurtful, and sweating more serviceable, than is consistent with the truth; as if there were no other hurtful powers but the former, no other remedies but the latter. In this, as well as in all other general sthenic diseases, it is the general sthenic
<PB N="237" REF="022373_0251_0FB86840A2B18010"/>
diathesis alone that produces, and the solution of it alone, that removes the disease. Which is a clear fact, and sup∣ported by the evidence of every part of this doctrine that has yet been delivered. The pains of parts, which some∣times precede this disease, oftener happen without being followed by it, and that, in both cases, have nothing to do with sthenic diathesis, upon which this disease entirely hinges, are a local affection, or belong to a very different general disease, rheumatalgia, of which more afterwards<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">CCCLIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCXCI. The reason of the greater joints being affected in this disease, and the lesser ones in the gout, is the following: In rheumatism, because both the rest of the disease and the pains depend upon a violent sthenic diathesis: therefore it is, that the greater joints, which, for the reasons assigned, undergo more of the diathesis, have also a greater share of the disease. But, as the gout consists in debility, its influence will be greatest, where there is <HI>naturally</HI> the greatest debility, and therefore in the extreme parts, and those most remote from the centre of activity<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">To make this subject simple to any apprehension. A person has been exposed to intense cold a whole day. He comes home at night, is set by a warm fire, receives hot meat and warm cordial drink. He is next covered up in his bed with an addition of clothes, receives more warm strong drink. He falls asleep, and next morning feels a pain in some part or other of his upper extremities, nigh, or between, the great joints; and, previous to that, a high state of heat and bouncing pulse, with a certain feeling of uneasiness in different parts of his trunk. The pains encrease in the bed next night in proportion to the encrease of the general affection; and cold, evacuation, and abstinence from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, from alternation of temperature, cure him.</NOTE>.</P>

of the mild; but in such sort, that the latter, both in its antecedent hurtful powers and symptoms, and in the whole nature of its cause, must be understood to be much mil∣der than the former, and not only so, but a remarkably mild disease.</P>
<P>CCCXCIII. It is often not so much a sequel of the sthenic cynanche, which is commonly called tonsillar, or the common inflammatory sore-throat, as a supervention upon it before it has finished its course.

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A Description of the Cynanche Sthenica.</HEAD>
<P>CCCXCV. The sthenic cynanche is a phlegmasia, with an inflammation taking place in the throat, and especially the tonsils, never preceding the pyrexia. It is accompanied with swelling and redness, and an aggravation of pain in swallowing, especially any thing fluid.</P>
<P>CCCXCVI. The reason for the inflammation occupy∣ing the place mentioned here, has been given before<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See CXIII. CCCXXII.</NOTE>.
<PB N="239" REF="022373_0253_0FB8684678A1C5B0"/>
And, when it has once taken place, it is afterwards li∣liable to frequent recurrence, because its seat being in the way of the most hurtful power<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Heat and alternation of temperature. See XXXVI. with addition.</NOTE>, and less covered than o∣ther parts<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See par. CLXVIII. If one is walking in the evening, when a sudden fog comes on, with cold and chilliness, he may cover his throat externally, but it is impossible to defend it internally.</NOTE>, is exposed: And the vessels <HI>first</HI> distended by the inflammation, and then afterwards relaxed, take in an over-proportion of blood upon every encrease of its im∣petus<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">This is so liable to happen, when any person has once experienced this disease, that the encreased motion of the blood in walking in a warm day, and then sitting down in a cool place, has sometimes produced oph∣thalmia, sometimes this sore-throat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCXCVII. As the inflammation, like <HI>that of</HI> the other phlegmasia never precedes the pyrexia<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See the definitions of them all, &amp;c.</NOTE>, for the reason assigned<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See par. CLXVIII. CCCXLIII.</NOTE>; so, if an unskilful person should think it did, the reason of that is the gradual degeneracy of the general sthenic inflammation into a local disease, from its frequent recurrence, and always leaving a taint behind it in the affected part. This latter <HI>inflammation</HI> may happen, without a general sthenic diathesis, and therefore, without being followed by a sthenic cynanche; and it may acci∣dentally coincide with the former, <HI>or sthenic diathesis,</HI> and, therefore, precede the latter or sthenic cynanche: But, in both cases, it ought to be distinguished from <HI>the pure</HI> ge∣neral <HI>case,</HI> for the sake of guarding against the commission of a hurtful mistake in the cure<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">This might happen to a person under an asthenic diathesis, which would be encreased by the debilitating plan of cure, and would be useless in the absence of diathesis.</NOTE>. In an asthenic habit, whether succeeding to the former or not, there is again a∣nother

general inflammation, to be refered to asthenic dis∣eases.</P>
<P>CCCXCVIII. If any person can explain why the pain is aggravated in swallowing, he may <HI>communicate</HI> his knowledge; if he cannot, it is no matter.</P>
<P>CCCXCIX. The cynanche oesophagaea has been here omitted, because it is a rare affection, and admits of the same reasoning and cure as the tonsillar, from which it differs not but in the inflamation being farther down, and in some redness only coming within view. But, as a su∣spicion that it may be local, as when the aesophagus hap∣pens to be eroded or burnt, by a stimulus, or some acrid matter; the distinctions, therefore, should be attended to<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See above LXXXI. LXXXIII. CLXX.</NOTE>, and made use of for the sake of practice.</P>
<P>CCCC. There is likewise a rare disease, sometimes happening in certain countries, never in others, called the croup<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">by nosologists cynanche stridula.</NOTE>. In it the respiration is laborious, the inspira∣tion sonorous, with hoarseness, a ringing cough, and a swelling scarce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be discerned<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">It is perceived upon dissection of the dead subject.</NOTE>. It is a disease that in∣fests very young children almost only. And in all other particulars it is of a doubtful nature<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">I never saw this disease, but when I was so young a student, that any observations I could make, can be of no use to me now. There have been many battles of words about, whether it be inflammatory or spasmodic, without any adequate meaning of the differences betwixt these two words, at least so far as to influence the practice; which re∣mained much the same betwixt the parties, and probably the right one missed by both.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCI. Concerning which, when it happens to oc∣cur in practice, use the following <HI>marks of</HI> judgment. As the sthenic diathesis, in the degree requisite to <HI>the forma∣tion of</HI> actual disease, which depends upon a high degree of
<PB N="241" REF="022373_0255_0FB8684941B16538"/>
diathesis, happens less, either in the beginning, or to∣wards the end of life; because the high degree of excitabi∣lity in the former, and the low degree of it in the latter, admit a smaller degree of the effect of the exciting power, <HI>that is,</HI> a smaller force of excitement<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See par. XXV. and XXVI.</NOTE>, than the long pe∣riod of human age betwixt these two extremes; yet it is not altogether foreign from either<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Though it is seldom that either a child, or very old man, will be so sthenic as to need bleeding and much evacuation, yet they will some∣times.</NOTE>. In childhood, the high degree of excitability compensates for the slightness of the stimulus; while, in old age, the high degree and force of the latter may compensate for the deficiency of the former, and suffice to induce some sthenic diathesis, even to that degree which constitutes disease. In this way infants undergo wonderful vicissitudes of excitement, and within the shortest spaces of time. This day they will show every sign of extreme debility, next day every one of <HI>restored</HI> vigour; because the operation of <HI>any</HI> stimulus given them soon rises to its highest, upon account of their high degree of excitability, and sinks as soon to its lowest, upon account of its own small degree<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">A child of mine was given over for death by his nurse: His mo∣ther gave him some of the diffusible stimulus. He slept two hours, and when he waked made signs, for he could not yet speak, to have a little pie, most of which he ate.</NOTE>. Hence every sthenic diathesis, that happens to them, is short, acute, and soon removed<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">A single gentle purge will do it.</NOTE>; nor is their asthenic state of long continuance, or difficult to be removed; provided there is no local affection<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">which very seldom, indeed, happens,</NOTE>, and a proper method of cure is em∣ployed<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Which, till of late, has been very rare: The antiphlogistic cure has made away with three-fourths of mankind, before they arrived at the seventh year of their age.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="022373_0256_0FB8684AC2AFF918"/>
CCCCII. The marks of sthenic diathesis at this age are, great frequency of pulse, when compared with that of adults, more frequent than their own in health, dis∣tinctly meeting the finger upon feeling it; a boundishness of belly at first, which becomes more free in the progress of the disease; dryness of the skin; burning heat, thirst, watching, strong crying.</P>
<P>CCCCIII. The signs of the asthenic diathesis at the same age are, a pulse not to be reckoned from its frequen∣cy, small, falling softly like snow upon the finger of him who reckons it, so that he is uncertain if he touch it at all; a very loose scouring belly, with green matter; fre∣quent vomiting; dryness of the skin, heat greater than natural, and greater in some parts than others; interrupted sleep, never refreshing: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> voice in crying, fit to excite compassion.</P>
<P>CCCCIV. The former <HI>diathesis,</HI> besides other hurtful powers, is preceded by the use of found milk, animal food, an abuse of opium or strong drink; excessive heat after cold and moisture, which latter encreases the debilitating effect of the former; a strong set of simple solids.</P>
<P>CCCCV. The latter, together with the known hurt∣ful powers, is preceded by the use of milk from a weak, sickly nurse; that of vegetable food, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in it; wa∣tery diet; watery drink; habitual vomiting, habitual pur∣ging, both by other means used for the latter, and particu∣larly by magnesia, given with the intention of absorbing an acid; cold not followed by heat; a weak mass of simple solids.</P>
<P>CCCCVI. Consider which of these sets of signs pre∣cede or accompany the croup, and whether its pyrexia be sthenic or asthenic. Weigh the different sentiments of authors upon the subject. Suspect their theories, but their facts <HI>still</HI> more. Be on guard not to be misled by the va∣nity, emptiness, and rashness of young physicians; as well
<PB N="243" REF="022373_0257_0FB8684F4F147170"/>
as by the obstinacy and bigotry of the older sort, that en∣creases with their age and practice, to be bent by no force of reasoning, no weight of truth, scarce by the power of God: Regard their minds as bound in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etters of preju∣dice: Remember, that a whole age of physicians were in the wrong, except one man<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">The improvement that Dr. Sydenham made was good for the length it went, which was, to use cool and gentle evacuants for the cure of the small-pox, peripneumony, and one or two more of the sthenic dis∣eases. The biass, in favour of the alexipharmac practice, for the cure of catarrh and measles, he never got over. His theories were vague, but with respect to the practice in the diseases among which his refor∣mation lay, they were innocent. He attained not any idea of the na∣ture of diseases depending on debility: And his practice was hurtful in them: He fell a victim to his gout, which could not have happened had he been acquainted with but one disease of the debility. His practice, even when right, was destitute of principle: He had no sort of compre∣hension of the doctrine of life as a whole, and as a department of know∣ledge distinct from all others. It would have been lucky, however, for posterity, had his successors done as much in asthenic, as he did in sthenic diseases. From that beginning, the ingenuity of some, at last under a right direction, might have brought out more information, and, by gra∣dual and sure steps, at last attained a comprehension of their whole sub∣ject. But professors of universities ruin every thing: For while they find out nothing themselves, they throw into false lights the useful hints of others. This was the effect first of the Boerhaavian, then of the Hoff∣manian and Stahlian doctrines. See our Observations, Outlines, p. lxxxiv. to clix.</NOTE>, and persisted obstinately in their error, in the case of the Alexipharmac physicians: And, reflect within yourself, <HI>good reader!</HI> whether the pre∣sent physicians, who follow the doctrines delivered in the schools, judge better <HI>than their predecessors,</HI> and do not run into the contrary extreme of madness, doing as much mis∣chief in fevers, and diseases of pure debility, as they did in sthenic diseases, and in fact take a wide range of spreading destruction among mankind. Thus secured against mis∣take, consider the cures of this disease that have appeared. If in those, or in any trial that you may make, you shall
<PB N="244" REF="022373_0258_0FB8685280D541C0"/>
find that either bleeding and purging, or antispasmodics, as they are called, that is, stimulants succeed; then be as∣sured, that, in the former case, the disease is sthenic, in the latter asthenic; <HI>of which you will be still</HI> more certain, if you shall find that the exciting hurtful powers and symp∣toms, which have been enumerated, at the same time agree <HI>with the other marks of judgment.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Description of Catarrh.</HEAD>
<P>CCCCVII. Catarrh is a phlegmasia, in which, to the general symptoms mentioned before<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">CCCXXXI.</NOTE>, are added cough; hoarseness; and first a suppression, or slight encrease of the excretion from the nose, sauces, and bronchia, fol∣lowed afterwards by a further encrease; arising from sti∣mulant powers, often heat alone, but chiefly after a pre∣vious application of cold; and to be removed by debilitating powers, often by cold alone, guarding against heat<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">See par. CXII. CXIV. CXVII. CXXII. and all the stimulant pow∣ers, from CXII. to CXLVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCVIII. The explanation of the cough is the same as that given before. But it is freer, <HI>than in peripneumony,</HI> and not avoided, because there is no inflammation in the neighbourhood to aggravate it, and raise pain<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">See par. CLX. CCCLV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCIX. That the hoarseness is owing to a suppres∣sion of the vapour that should be exhaled into the bron∣chia, may be known from this; that, when the hoarseness has remained long, almost without expectoration and cough, or with a moderate degree of them, while the sthenic diathesis continued in full force, and did not abate in the bronchia; upon the diathesis giving way, and the expectoration and cough becoming more free, the hoarse∣ness abates, or goes off. That this can be effected by a
<PB N="245" REF="022373_0259_0FB86853C7905720"/>
stimulus of that kind and degree, that constitutes sthenic diathesis, is shown by <HI>the effect of</HI> strained speaking produ∣cing temporary hoarseness, by silence removing the hoarse∣ness, and cold drink relieving it.</P>
<P>CCCCX. The suppression of excretion is that of the mucus and exhalable fluid, related before<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCCVIII.</NOTE>, and it ad∣mits of the same explanation that was formerly given.</P>
<P>CCCCXI. That stimulants produce catarrh is evident from this, that heat alone, fulness in food, strong drink, and moderate exercise, for certain produce it; cold, cold drink, spare diet, and rest, as certainly and effectually re∣move it. It was, therefore, a very unlucky mistake, to think it arose from cold alone, and was to be cured by heat. On the contrary, cold is never hurtful in it, but when its action is succeeded by that of heat, to be explained as be∣fore<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See CXXII.</NOTE>. The occurrence of catarrh so often in summer, where its action can be a thousand times traced back to heat, but not to cold; the influenza never needing the assistance of cold, which catarrh often does, in the man∣ner just now said; its never succeeding to <HI>pure</HI> cold, but immediately to heat, facts known to old women, to shoe∣makers and taylors, to sore-eyed persons and barbers, un∣known to medical authors and professors, <HI>all</HI> confirm the same fact.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of the Scarlet Pyrexia.</HEAD>
<P>CCCCXIII. The scarlet pyrexia is an exanthema<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See CCCXXX.</NOTE>; about the fourth day of which, or later, the face swells somewhat, and at the same time the skin is here and there affected with a red efflorescence, and then checquered with large spots; which are afterwards to unite, and in three days to end in little scales, as if branny ones. This erup-does not arise, but in consequence of sthenic diathesis pro∣duced from another source. And there is another similar to this, which accompanies an opposite disease, afterwards to be mentioned.</P>
<P>CCCCXIV. The eruption, appearing at a certain time, and remaining for some time, must be imputed to the fermentation, requiring a certain time, different in different diseases, and is to be explained in a similar man∣ner as before<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCLXVII. and CCCLXXVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCXV. The swelling of the face depends upon a greater degree of sthenic diathesis there, than any other e∣qual part. And we are to imagine, that, besides the hurt∣ful powers that usually produce it, it is encreased by the contagious matter, now approaching the surface.</P>
<P>CCCCXVI. This matter of itself produces no morbid state, only giving the exterior and exanthematic form<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCLXXV.</NOTE>, and following the nature of the sthenic or asthenic diathe∣sis. Hence, after its application, the disease that arises is sometimes sthenic, as this is, of which we have given a definition, sometimes asthenic, as that disease which we are afterwards to mention in its proper place. This view of it serves to reconcile the jarring and contradictory ex∣planations, and methods of cure of authors, who have gone into such controversies to settle its nature.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of the mild Small-pox.</HEAD>
<P>CCCCXVII. The definition of the mild and violent small-pox is the same; excepting that there are often veryfew pustules, never exceeding one or two hundred in number: Sometimes the place only, which was inoculated, is be∣set with pustules, without any other in the rest of the bo∣dy; and besides, these there may be only one.</P>
<P>CCCCXVIII. The number of pustules and crouded eruption is occasioned not by the nature of the contagious matter, nor by its quantity, but by the sthenic diathesis, in so far as it is induced by the sthenic hurtful powers, in which the matter has very little participation<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCLXX. CCCLXXII. CCCLXXV.</NOTE>. If, therefore, that diathesis be prevented, and especially upon the surface, the eruption will never be crowded; and, af∣ter it has appeared, if it be immediately removed, the erup∣tion will never be dangerous.</P>
<P>CCCCXIX. As the contagious matter does not con∣tribute much towards sthenic diathesis, for the reasons al∣ledged<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">From CCCCXVII. to CCCCXIX.</NOTE>; so, that it does contribute something, is pro∣ved by a crowded eruption both appearing and encreasing, when the diathesis, after the reception of the contagion, was not encreased by the ordinary hurtful powers<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">This indeed, is a clear proof, that the matter contributes something, and that there may be a degree of diathesis, compatible with health, un∣less when it is encreased, and the perspiration diminished, by such con∣tagious matter.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of Mania.</HEAD>
<P>CCCCXXVI. Mania is a sthenic apyrexia; in which the mind is disordered, and forms false ideas of every thing.</P>
<P>CCCCXXVII. In so far as mania does not arise from a fault of the substance of the brain, which is a local case that sometimes happens: the powers that have the chief share in producing it, are excessive exercise of the mental function, and a high exuberance of passion. These, however, while they act more upon the brain <HI>than any o∣ther part,</HI> at the same time do act more or less also upon the whole body, though not to the degree of drawing py∣rexia after them<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Compare this par. XLIX. L. LI. LII. LIII. and indeed with that whole chapter, as the severest trial of the truth of it; nothing being more natural, than the supposition that a mad man is only affected in his head, but we shall find that not true.</NOTE>. Which is proved by the disease be∣ing cured by a debilitating plan, and by other stimuli, as well as those just now mentioned, not immediately applied to the brain, but to a distant part of the system from it.</P>
<P>CCCCXXVIII. The most powerful of those stimuli are, spirituous or vinous drink, and opium, and, perhaps, some other things, taken into the stomach, and first acting there. Of the other asthenic hurtful powers, some <HI>of them∣selves, and operating</HI> alone, have less effect in inducing ma∣nia, and yet, <HI>even they,</HI> by their stimulant operation en∣crease the force of those, that have that hurtful effect; as is proved by the effect of removing them in relieving the disease.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="022373_0264_0FB86860945CB908"/>
CCCCXXIX. If poisons sometimes produce mania, without hurting the substance of any solid part, their ope∣ration must be supposed the same, as that of the general stimulants, their effect the same, and the disease a general one, and the same<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See par. XX.</NOTE>. But if these very poisons act by de∣stroying the texture of a part, they must be considered as the origin of a local disease<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See par. V. VI. XX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCXXX. The heart and arteries are less affected in mania, <HI>than in any of the pyrexial diseases;</HI> because, the hurtful power, which chiefly affects the vessels, too much food, has less concern in the number of the hurtful pow∣ers <HI>here.</HI> And yet that the food, superadded to the other hurtful powers, does prove hurtful <HI>even in this disease,</HI> is evident from <HI>a contrary power,</HI> abstinence, being, among other remedies, found of very great efficacy in restoring the healthy state. Which, with what has been said above, proves that mania is not a disease confined to a part, but extended to the whole system.</P>
<P>CCCCXXXI. Although, in the diseases that have just now been mentioned<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">from CCCCXXV. to CCCCXXXII.</NOTE>, the pulse is commonly said, and believed, to be not at all affected, that, however is not exactly the truth; for in mania, so long as it continues to be a sthenic disease<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">that is, so long as it is really mania,</NOTE>, more or less of sthenic state can be perceived<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">The characteristic of hardness of the pulse is never wanting, and therefore also fulness. (See CCCXXXIV.)</NOTE>.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Description of Morbid Watchfulness.</HEAD>
<P>CCCCXXXII. Pervigilium, or morbid watchful∣ness, is a sthenic apyrexia<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCCXXV.</NOTE>; in which there is no sleep,
<PB N="251" REF="022373_0265_0FB868620E09EEE0"/>
or no sound sleep, and the mind, in a startled state, is agi∣tated with vivid, strong, or uneasy impressions.</P>
<P>CCCCXXXIII. The hurtful powers, that produce perviligium, are the same with those, that produce mania, but inferior in force. It is evidently produced by hard thinking, commotion, or disturbance of mind, in prefer∣ence to other hurtful powers. The degree of thought, that has that effect, is not ultimately excessive; for, if it were, by effecting a temporary waste of the excitability, it would produce sound sleep; or if it repelled sleep, it could only act so, by means of indirect debility, the consideration of which is foreign from this place<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">See CXLI.</NOTE>. And the same is the degree of disturbance of feeling, that proves hurtful, in so far as it produces this disease: Every ultimate excess of which<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">See CXLI.</NOTE>, either ends in sleep, or induces that vigilance, of which indirect debility is the cause. But it is not a sin∣gle operation of the intellectual faculty, or of the state of any passion, or one that happens but rarely, that proves adequate to the effect. For the effect, in that case, would be either too slight, or of too short continuance; to merit the title of disease. It is an often returning, or deeply af∣fecting, irritation upon the brain, and, therefore; one that leaves a lasting impression, which has any considerable force in producing this disease. In this last way, an eager, inordinate, and vast desire for the attainment of high ob∣jects of pursuit, the impulse that hurries on to the revenge of a great injury, and the horror that arises upon the per∣petration of it, the fear of future punishment for crimes, are held up to us as productive of high commotion of mind, in the examples of Cataline, Orestes, and Francis Spira. As often, therefore, as the mind is so excited in its ideas and passions, as not to be capable of being composed to rest and sound sleep, after a certain short continuance of those,
<PB N="252" REF="022373_0266_0FB8686395B36F68"/>
or other stimuli; so often are we to conclude, that this disease takes place.</P>
<P>CCCCXXXIV. As the hurtful powers just now men∣tioned<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">See the par. CCCCXXX. and CCCCXXXIII.</NOTE>, produce this disease; so there are others, which belong not to this place, <HI>but</HI> are to be mentioned, that al∣so repel sleep.</P>
<P>CCCCXXXV. To pervigilium belong all the hurtful powers that have been already mentioned in mania<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See from CCCCXXVI. to CCCCXXXII.</NOTE>, whether acting within or without the brain, but acting with less force, and which yield to the asthenic plan of cure.</P>
<P>CCCCXXXVI. As the powers stimulating vigour∣sly in this way<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See CCCCXXXIII.</NOTE>, and without any diminution of their sum of stimulating, produce pervigilium; from that we learn that the cause of this disease is the same with that of the rest of the sthenic form of diseases<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">from CXLI to CXLVIII.</NOTE>, and that the same is the state of body in which every one of those diseases consist: Nor is it understood, that different hurtful powers, but precisely the same, with only a variation in the proportion of their force, which often happens to other sthenic disea∣ses precede <HI>this disease.</HI></P>
<P>CCCCXXXVII. The same fact is also discovered from the functions, of which, though th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se diseases are called apyrexiae, or without pyrexial state, the pulse, however, is not altogether free of disease<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See CCCCXXX and CCCCXXXI. and the note to the latter.</NOTE>. On the contrary, it is as much stronger than in health, or in the predisposition to asthenic diseases, or in those diseases themselves, as there is more vigour, and more excitement upholding that vi∣gour, in the system<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">For a proof of their vigour maniacs have often four times the strength, they used to have in health.</NOTE>. And the state of the other func∣tions,
<PB N="253" REF="022373_0267_0FB86866DFFF7F70"/>
except those of the brain, that are chiefly affected, is truly the same as in the milder sthenic affections, or in the predisposition to these. But, if the brain in this dis∣ease, and in mania, is much more affected than the rest of the body; there is nothing unusual in that circumstance; it being an universal fact with respect to both diseases and the predisposition to them, that some part is more affected <HI>than any other part</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See part first, Chap. IV. and in it XLIX. and LII. CLIX. CCV.</NOTE>.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A Description of Obesity.</HEAD>
<P>CCCCXXXVIII. Obesity is a sthenic apyrexia<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See CCCCXXV.</NOTE>; in which in consequence of an excess of health, rich living, especially in the article of food, and an easy sedentary way of life, the sat rises to the degree of incommoding the func∣tions.</P>
<P>CCCCXXXIX. That obesity, so defined, is a disease, is understood from the definition of disease<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">See IV.</NOTE>; and that it is a sthenic disease, appears from the certain signs of sthenic diathesis in it. Of which, the strong action of the stomach, whether the apetite or the digestion be conside∣red<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCLXII.</NOTE>, and the strength of the other digestive organs, are a glaring proof.</P>
<P>CCCCXL. And as in this disease, the stimulus of the exciting powers, raises the excitement above that degree of it which suits good health, to that in which sthenic diathesis consists, without which last there could not be such force in the <HI>action of the</HI> stomach, and of the organs that form chyle and blood; so, it is in common to this with the other diseases called sthenic apyrexiae that the sum of all the stimuli is much less than in the o∣ther diseases of the same form, that is, those with pyrexia and inflammation; that it never rises to the extreme height at which indirect debility is produced, and is never indeed
<PB N="254" REF="022373_0268_0FB86869C4E403A0"/>
so great as to be sufficient to have any considerable effect on the heart and vessels.</P>
<P>CCCCXLI. But it happens to all those diseases, that both these last and all the other functions, get somewhat above the standard of the sound functions, and a great deal above asthenic diathesis. And the sthenic apyrexiae differ from the other sthenic diseases chiefly in this, that the ex∣citing powers keep much within that degree <HI>of force,</HI> that wastes the excitability much; as is perceived from the proof of the effect; for they are diseases of much longer standing than any other asthenic diseases.</P>
<P>CCCCXLII. From which fact, however, much the brain may be affected by its own proper stimuli; however great the quantity of blood in its vessels may be; unless to the excitement arising from these, that <HI>excitement,</HI> which the other stimulant powers produce, be added, it is cer∣tain, that the general effect will be much less, and that the united energy of all the powers has far more effect, than the separate force of any.</P>
<P>CCCCXLIII. The diathesis, then, in these diseases, is, upon the whole, less than in the rest of the sthenic dis∣eases; that of a part, as of the brain in mania and pervi∣gilium, and of the blood-vessels in obesity, is pretty consi∣derable. The whole is in general as great as that in the predisposition to the other diseases, and exceeding its force in the labouring part. Hence it comes out, that, contra∣ry to the nature of those other diseases, and similar to the predisposition to them, they are usually of long standing and duration, and for this reason, that the mediocrity of the sum of stimulant operation never consumes the excita∣bility, and always produces too much excitement. The great tumult of symptoms in the brain and <HI>blood</HI>-vessels in these diseases does not imply a great sum of excitement, for this reason, that the affection of a part, however for∣midable, compared with the affection of all the rest of the
<PB N="255" REF="022373_0269_0FB8686D337B2B30"/>
body, is infinitely inferior in its degree<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">See par. XLIX. to LIII.</NOTE>. However much, then, any stimulus presses upon a part, and from that spreads at large over the rest of the body; unless, how∣ever, other stimuli, applied to other parts, sustain its ope∣ration, so as that the sum of the operation of them all may deeply affect the whole body: the effect of the solita∣ry stimulus, making a figure in a part, will be less consi∣derable in the rest of the body: In fine, it must be kept in mind, that every violent disease always arises from the excitement which the united force of several stimuli has produced.</P>
<P>CCCCXLIV. In these sthenic apyrexiae, as a certain part, the brain in the two first, and the blood vessels in the last<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCCXLIII.</NOTE>, is much more affected, and in greater propor∣tion, than in the other sthenic diseases, because the affec∣tion of the part is much less supported by stimuli acting upon the other parts; so the stimuli, acting in that way upon the labouring parts, are, however, understood to affect the rest of the body, though less considerably. That this is the fact, is proved by there being <HI>in this case,</HI> no asthenic diathesis, and evidently such a sthenic one, as up∣holds the predisposition to other diseases of the sthenic form; by the remedies, which affect other parts, as it will by and by appear, being aiding in the cure here, and by powers of a contrary nature, always proving hurtful. Whence, it is an evident and certain truth, even here, where it might have been least expected, that every stimulus that affects a part, affects the whole body, upon account of the excita∣bility being one uniform, undivided, property over the whole.</P>
<P>CCCCXLV. With respect to obesity in particular; that the other hurtful powers, as well as food, have more or less effect, one may know from the certain fact of the
<PB N="256" REF="022373_0270_0FB8686EC7B8A388"/>
digestive powers, which depend upon the influence of these <HI>powers,</HI> being of such force and vigour, as to perform their function<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more perfectly <HI>in fat persons,</HI> than in others, who are, nevertheless, not by any means weak. Yet these hurtful powers are applied in a degree short of that, which being ultimately excessive, or approaching nearly to that, puts an end to excitement by wasting the excitability, or which tends, by a high degree of disturbance, to exhaust the body.</P>
<P>CCCCXLVI. Thus passions are not with such per∣sons too stimulant; a circumstance known to the generality of mankind, among whom it is an adage, that fat persons are commonly good natured<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">This must be taken with more than grains of allowance; since such is the effect of the different motives to human action received from example and education, that the passions themselves are drawn into a subserviency to every person's predominant pursuit. I have known a person in Edinburgh get great credit for his integrity, though that was not extraordinary, from roughness of manners and an affectation of pas∣sionateness, while the dissimulation of that real disposition is the more general engine among men of promoting their interest. At any rate, so much more than mere appearance of temper, which may be so much over-ruled, is necessary to the establishment of maxim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; that I should think my life or property upon an insecure footing, if it depended on the good nature of a person, for which the only security was his fatness.</NOTE>, while morose persons are for the most part lean. Thus it is observable, that fat persons are averse to thinking, which is a great stimu∣lus<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">The most poring persons are the atrabilarians, who, though they are not calculated for the elevation of mind that discovery requires, have, by their assiduity, contributed much to the improvement of many of the arts. They are commonly very meagre, indeed, and indefatigable in any pursuit, to which they give themselves up.</NOTE>. They are averse to bodily motion, by which all the functions, and particularly that of the vessels, are much excited, and the perspiration proportionally promoted; and <HI>they have</HI> so far reason for it, that all motion is more fatiguing to them than to others. Hence, that quantity
<PB N="257" REF="022373_0271_0FB8687070D68870"/>
of fluids, which under motion is usually thrown off by the pores on the surface, and turned out of the course to the adipose cells, has a great opportunity of quitting the direction to the former, and of turning aside, in a state of rest, to the latter.</P>
<P>CCCCXLVII. After explaining the peculiarities of these diseases; <HI>it is now to be observed,</HI> that, since the af∣fection of a part in general disease, depends upon the gene∣ral affection, is of the same kind, arises from the same ex∣citing powers, and is removed by the same remedies<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See part first, Chap. IV. and particularly par. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></NOTE>; it is from that reasonable to believe, that the affection of a part, whether it be inflammation, or a greater affection of the brain or vessels, than of any other part, is not different in different cases, but altogether the same in all; that it only differs in some trifling circumstances of no signification, and by no means requires a different <HI>plan of</HI> cure, or affords fundamental distinctions; and that a mistake, which has had the most ruinous effect upon the art, must be done away. It is with propriety, then, that all the diseases that have been treated of, have been reduced not first to two genera, and after to species, but, without regard either to genera or species, only to two forms.</P>
<P>CCCCXLVIII. Further, as in all those diseases the whole morbid state, either in so far as it is universal in the system, or confined to a part, proves hurtful by giving too much excitement; and as the remedies, that remove the general morbid state, also remove the portion of it con∣fined to a part, and are never to be directed to a part<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See par. LVI. and XCII.</NOTE> with the view of removing, by their action upon it, the disease, as if all locked up in it; the meaning of all that is, to lay a sure foundation for the establishment of a cer∣tain series, or scale, of encreasing strength from perfect
<PB N="258" REF="022373_0272_0FB86871F05926C8"/>
health to the most sthenic disease. In that scale peripneu∣mony holds about the highest, and obesity the lowest, de∣gree.</P>
<P>CCCCXLIX. Peripneumony and phrenitis in the upper end are followed by two diseases, that sometimes equal them; the violent small-pox and measles. These two are succeeded by a disease, that sometimes vies with them, the erysipelas, when accompanied with a most se∣vere affection of the head. Equal to this, not in danger, but for the most part in the degree of diathesis; rheumatism comes next. Next to rheumatism is marked the mild and gentle erysipelas, <HI>far short of those above it in violence,</HI> and claiming nearly an equal place to the sthenic cynanche, being much more nearly allied to the latter than any of the former. Those are the diseases accompanied with pyrexia and inflammation.</P>
<P>CCCCL. Of these two which stand lowest, the mild erysipelas and the sthenic cynanche, or common inflam∣matory sore throat, are of so doubtful a rank with respect to each other and catarrh<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See CCCXCIV. and the note to it.</NOTE>, a disease without the accom∣paniment of inflammation; that it is doubtful which of them all should be set above the others. Below them, however, the simple synocha and scarlet fever, in so far as the latter is an asthenic disease, and in so far as the usual state of them both is considered, are to be placed without any hesitation<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">The simple synocha is so similar to a gentle typhus, that it requires great judgment to distinguish them at first. The safest way, when the doubt cannot be determined, is to keep the patient in a moderate tempe∣rature, and in a state of rest; as any debilitating power, in case the dis∣ease should turn out a typhus, would be dangerous; and, though it should afterwards manifest itself a synocha, still its mildness renders the omission of any thing that might have been done, innocent; and it is always easy to take down sthenic diathesis.</NOTE>. The lowest part of the scale of sthenic
<PB N="259" REF="022373_0273_0FB8687624BAA238"/>
diseases with pyrexia, is assigned to the small-pox and mea∣sles, in their mild state.</P>
<P>CCCCLI. Through this whole scale it is not so much the titles and names, that have been made use of, bu mor∣bid energy, that is regarded; it being the certainty derived from the cause, not the uncertain and perfectly deceitful consideration of symptoms, that was to be considered<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">See par. LVIII.</NOTE>. The investigation of symptoms, which has hitherto been devoid of all benefit, has been of the highest detriment to the art; and as much in medicine the most productive source of fundamental blunders, as the question about ab∣stract causes had been in the other departments of philo∣phy<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">See par. XVIII. and look into Observations on the different sys∣tems of physic, and in it the introduction throughout.</NOTE> must be laid aside, and Nosology damned.</P>
<P>CCCCLII. Below the last mentioned diseases, mania, pervigilium, and obesity are set. Betwixt which, and the diseases mentioned above, is the <HI>point of</HI> perfect health to be fixed<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">It will be easy for the reader with the directions above to make out the table for himself.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>The Cure of the Sthenic Form of Diseases.</HEAD>
<P>CCCCLIII. To apply the indication of the cure of the sthenic form of diseases to practice; that mentioned before<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">See par. LXXXVIII.</NOTE> will be accommodated first to a violent degree of the diathesis and danger of parts, in such a manner, as that regard only will be had to the degree <HI>of force</HI> in the reme∣dies<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">See also par. XCII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCLIV. When, therefore, a violent diathesis is discerned, as in peripneumony, phrenitis, the small-pox, the measles, and erysipelas, in the highest degree of these three last, immedate recourse must be had to the most powerful
<PB N="260" REF="022373_0274_0FB86877C8EDFAF0"/>
and quickly effectual remedy; and so much blood should not be taken, as many who entrust nearly the whole cure of the disease to it, think<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">which is the common practice;</NOTE>, but more, however, than others are of opinion, should be taken away<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The most early among the Alexipharmac practitioners, after once making his escape from peripneumony without bleeding, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll a victim to the folly of his theory in the next attack. The Alexipharmacs in gene∣ral were too moderate in their bleedings in the true, though few, sthe∣nic diseases that require it, and all in the wrong in their use of heating stimulant prescriptions in them.</NOTE></P>
<P>CCCCLV. No measure suits all cases; the quantity to be taken being different in different cases, as those differ in age, sex, strength, and in the degree of force applied by the exciting hurtful powers. In child-hood, which, ex∣cepting the measles, and small-pox<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCCI.</NOTE>, is seldom affected with the diseases we have mentioned, and in a very advan∣ced age, which is also in less danger than that at the flower of human life; sparing bleeding succeeds for this reason, that, at both those ages, it is a lesser degree of excitement that upholds the disease as a cause; while in the former, the high degree of excitability, in the latter the necessity for more stimulus or exciting power, than formerly, set bounds to <HI>the measure of the remedy.</HI></P>
<P>CCCCLVI. A better rule for limiting the degree of bleeding is the relief, or temporary solution, of the urgent symptoms. If, therefore, after blood has been taken, the great heat, the hardness of the pulse, the affection of the head or of the lungs, and dryness of the surface, shall have gone off, or been much abated; and now the temperature is discerned to be much more moderate, the pulse more soft, and less frequent, and the surface of the body more moist, at least less dry; if the pain is every where quieted,
<PB N="261" REF="022373_0275_0FB868794C176DB0"/>
the breathing relieved, and the delirium removed<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">The references for facts are CLIX. CLV. CCCXXXIV. CLVII. CLXXIV. CCCXLIX. to CCCLV. CLIV. CLIX. CLXXXIV. CCCXXXIII. to CCCXXXVI. CLV. CCCXLIII. CCCLIV. CLVIII.</NOTE>; then it may be looked upon as certain, that enough of the vital fluid has been shed for the time.</P>
<P>CCCCLVII. To obtain that benefit, in the most vi∣gorous adult state 10 or 12 ounces, and much less <HI>either</HI> before or after <HI>that period of life,</HI> will for the most part be found sufficient. As this rule will not answer in every case, when it fails, recourse must be had to that, which recom∣mends the abatement of the symptoms as a direction more to be depended upon<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See CCCCVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCLVIII. Since the local affection depends upon the degree of the the general<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See above LVI. and CCCXLII. to CCCXLVI.</NOTE> diathesis, remember, there∣fore that there is no occasion for any particular direction with regard to it, any farther, than to take advantage of its being accessible to help the general remedy by an ap∣plication of it to the part<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Ibid. an instance of such assistance may be the local bleedings over the pained part in rheumatism and the gout, and some other asthe∣nic remedies are aided by local stimuli.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCLIX. When that has been done, and the first vi∣olence of the disease is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> broken; we must next have recourse to purging the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y, as a great remedy in point of efficacy<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See CCLXXXIII.</NOTE>. To effect which, we should not employ violent means, such as many formerly employed<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">the Alexipharmacs particularly,</NOTE>; the stimulus accompanying the first operation of which being liable to be hurtful; but it is the gentle cathartics that should be depended upon, such as Glauber's salts, which are highly debilitating, and carry a great quantity of fluids out of the vessels. Though a man of good sense in the last century used these day about with bleeding; yet, if
<PB N="262" REF="022373_0276_0FB8687AC18EBA38"/>
the violence of the disease should be urgent, there is no∣thing to hinder the use of them the same day that the blood has been taken.</P>
<P>CCCCLX. Purging, after a sparing bleeding, has more effect in overcoming sthenic diathesis, than any bleed∣ing without it; because, as it has been mentioned above, in that way the debilitating power (which has always more debilitating effect in the place to which it is first applied <HI>than in any other,</HI>) is applied to more parts; and not only to the greater blood-vessels, but also to a prodigious num∣ber of their terminations; and the excitability is more ex∣tensive, and therefore, with more equality diminished<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCCLXXXIII. CCCCLXXXVI. also CCCV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Vomiting, which, in asthenic diseases, where it is pernicious, has hitherto never been admitted in the common practice, and in sthenic ones, where it is of the greatest benefit, ever neglected, comes in here as a proper part of cure; being of the same evacuant nature, and in another part of the same canal, and admitting of all the reasoning that has been applied to purging.</P>
<P>CCCCLXI. At the same time that the excessive, and therefore hurtful, use of the lancet is superseded by those two last mentioned evacuations; its use, however, is not altogether to be laid aside in the the diseases of excessive ex∣citement; and for this reason, that the excitement, by its stimulating operation often rises to that high degree, that, from the consumption of excitability which puts an end to it existence, threatens instant death<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCLXXXI. and CCLXXXIII. CCLXXXIV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCLXII. Besides, those remedies<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">From CCCCLIV to CCCCLXII.</NOTE>, the patient should always be required to abstain from every sort of food but vegetable, and in a fluid form, as well as from all strong drink, and <HI>indeed</HI> all but watery drink, accidulated<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">See CCLXXXIV.</NOTE>.

This direction does not seem to have been so much ne∣glected in words by former <HI>writers and authors,</HI> as in fact and actual application to the practice; it having been de∣livered slightly, by the by, and as if it had been thought of no consequence <HI>with such effect,</HI> that its force made no impression upon the mind of the reader or hearer. No sti∣mulus is more powerful, and, therefore, <HI>in this part of the practice,</HI> more hurtful, than that of the articles of di∣et: Consequently, whatever quantity of blood is taken from its vessels, whatever quantity of serous fluid is carri∣ed off by the mouth and anus, if that stimulus is not round∣ly guarded against, all this evacuation may easily be frustra∣ted. While that is the case, still fluid vegetable matter is not to be discharged, and for this good reason, that wa∣tery matter is not kept in the vessels; but, easily entering the smallest of them, flows out in all directions by their va∣rious outlets; and, at the same time, supports the efficacy of another remedy<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">sweat.</NOTE>, by and by to be mentioned.</P>
<P>CCCCLXIII. Conjointly with the use of the first bleed∣ing, of the first vomiting and purging, and that of absti∣nence and watery drink, it must not be forgot, that parti∣cular regard must be paid to temperature<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCLXXXII.</NOTE>: For, if cold always debilitates, and if that is its proper operation<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCVII.</NOTE>, if it only seemingly acts otherwise, because heat succeed∣ing to its action, or alternating with it<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See XXXVII.</NOTE>, converts it into a stimulant one, if it alone is adequate to the cure of the small-pox<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">See par.

<P>CCCCLXIV. Its operation in the small-pox, and in the rest of the sthenic diseases, is not different, but altoge∣ther
<PB N="264" REF="022373_0278_0FB8688380EFE9F8"/>
the same. Nay, in all the diseases of this form, as cold alone is sufficient to effect the cure; so, whenever the dia∣thesis, which is the case in the diseases that make our pre∣sent subject, rising to its greatest rage, demands instant re∣lief; because, <HI>in that case,</HI> every moment's delay brings in∣stant danger; because the remedies, which we have men∣tioned, are sufficient for the solution of the disease, of which we have the direct proof in the practice; because that de∣gree of cold, which could produce that effect, is neither al∣ways within our reach, nor can be managed by every per∣son; and many persons might not be disposed to believe its effects so beneficial: For those reasons we should not desist from the plan of cure here laid down<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">From CCCCLIV. to CCCCLXV.</NOTE>, and do our best for our patient, by taking off the blankets, and other clothes, by cooling the room, and, instead of laying him on a couch or bed, putting him into a chair.</P>
<P>CCCCLXV. This plan of cure should, for the most part, be preferred to <HI>that of</HI> the most intense cold, for this fur∣ther reason, that the shortness of the time in which any one could possibly remain in it, would oblige him immediately to return to higher temperature, which would produce a greater stimulus of excitement, <HI>than that he had been under</HI> before <HI>his exposure,</HI> at least too great a stimulus<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">See XXVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCLXVI. Since such is the operation of cold<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Look back from CCCCLXIII to CCCCLXVI.</NOTE>, the power falsely imputed to it of occasioning the striking in of the measles, is to be imputed not to cold alone, but to heat and other stimuli; giving, as has been explained, more excitement<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">See XXVII. and CCCLXXX.</NOTE>, than if it had not preceded. And why not? If cold does not interrupt the eruption in the small-pox; but, on the contrary, by an enlargement of of the diameters of the perspiratory vessels, which are shut up by sthenic diathesis, highly promotes the discharge of
<PB N="265" REF="022373_0279_0FB868860446C5B8"/>
that matter<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">See CCCLXXVI.</NOTE>: Why, in a most similar case, should its operation be supposed different, not to say, diametrically opposite? Must we again have the trouble to refute the false notion of thinking a cause precisely the same should pro∣duce contrary effects? Cold diminishes the eruption in the small-pox: It makes it disappear in the measles. What then? Take a nearer view of the fact: Is its effect in both these cases to be supposed the same, or different? How comes any person to know, that the matter, which has disappeared, is driven into the interior parts? What proof will you bring of that? Confess the truth: And be candid enough to acknowledge, that this is another relic of the alexipharmac doctrine, <HI>handed down to us,</HI> which supposed, that the stimulus of heat as well as other stimuli promo∣ted, and that cold impeded, perspiration. And after a great man had shown the error of that doctrine, both in the small-pox and other diseases<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">In peripne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mony he took his patients out of bed, and set them in a chair, for the fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of cooling them, and avoiding the hurtful effect of heat.</NOTE>, because he did not car∣ry the application so far as the measles, neither has any one of his followers, who never could step a nail's breadth be∣yond his words. But it might have been observed, <HI>if ob∣servation had been any part of their employment,</HI> that the mea∣sles was a sthenic disease as well as the small-pox. Are not all the successful remedies in both of the debilitating kind? And as it was manifest, that in the small-pox also cold debilitated, or in the common language, acted as a sedative; might no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some suspicion have, from that very circumstance, occurred to their mind, that cold, in the measles, did not stimulate, or act as an astringent; and in that way, repel the eruption, but performed the same operation as in the small-pox? Is it, to such a degree, difficult and up-hill work, to think and use one's own
<PB N="266" REF="022373_0280_0FB86887E898BEF8"/>
good sense, that, a great part of mankind, even those who take upon them the business of teaching and taking the lead of others, in no case, ever think of exercising a moment's reflection of their own? But, in this case, it may be con∣tended, that the action of cold is peculiar, because, after the eruption, <HI>which it is supposed to check,</HI> has disappeared, all the symptoms encrease in rage and violence. Con∣sider what that circumstance makes for the argument, or whether it makes any thing, and not absolutely against it? Was the action of cold, that is supposed, followed by <HI>that of</HI> stimulant or debilitating powers? If it was by the former, the cause of the mischief must be imputed to them; which, as has been said just now<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">in the last paragraph but one.</NOTE>, produce ex∣cessive excitement after a previous application of cold, and more than without it; if the latter, <HI>or debilitating powers were used,</HI> then there would not be wanting a suspicion, that cold had a concern in the effect. But it is not so: And, in every case, in which the action of cold has been followed by sthenic diathesis, the true cause of that effect is not sufficiently guarding against the stimulus of heat, as well as that of other noxious powers. And this is most clearly proved by the use of heat being positively ordered, instead of being forbid, in the common practice. Nor is that to be wondered at: For if the cause of catarrh<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See from CCCCVII. to CCCCXII.</NOTE> de∣ceived physicians so much, the catarrhal symptoms in the measles could not fail to deceive them. And, if doctrines, discarded in words, are often kept up in fact; what was there to hinder this part of the alexipharmac doctrine from meeting with a similar fate?</P>
<P>CCCCLXVII. If cold, therefore, can scarce be so manage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as that the effect occasioned by the accompani∣ment, the succession, or the alternation, of stimulants
<PB N="267" REF="022373_0281_0FB868890F20D168"/>
with it, may be prevented, whether that be the fault of the physician, or owing to the difficulty of the nature of the thing<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Turn back to CCCCLXV. and CCCCLXVI.</NOTE>; it is, notwithstanding, a rule in common to the measles and other exanthemata of the same stamp, to avoid heat, and compensate for the degree by the great∣er duration of cold, and to guard with all possible care a∣gainst every stimulant power. It is now then most evident, that the opinion of cold being peculiarly hurtful in the measles, both in that and every other disease of the same form, falls to the ground.</P>

<HEAD>A Repetition of the Cure.</HEAD>
<P>CCCCLXVIII. After using the remedies which have been mentioned<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">from CCCCLIV. to CCCCI. XVIII.</NOTE>, when the symptoms are renewed, the same train of medicines must be again gone through: Blood must be again taken, emetics and purgatives again admi∣nistered; nor must we desist from the use of the refrige∣rant and attenuant plan: And all these particulars must be executed, till the tumult of the symptoms be allayed, and the healthy state, at least for the time, be restored; and perhaps <HI>the repetition may be required</HI> a third time or oftener: After doing which:</P>
<P>CCCCLXIX. If the diathesis seems now nearly remo∣ved, if the affection of the head, of the lungs, or any in∣ternal one, seems alleviated or repelled; and yet there is some apprehension of a likelihood of the return of the dis∣ease: in that case, recourse must be had to more gentle debilitating powers. Sweating, the stimulus accompany∣ing the first operation of which, the body, as the diathesis is now rendered mild or ended, will be able to bear, must be preferred to bleeding, vomiting, and purging. But before proceeding to speak of it, it seems proper to say a
<PB N="268" REF="022373_0282_0FB8688A836FCE78"/>
few things upon the sum total of blood that should be ta∣ken <HI>during the course of the disease.</HI></P>
<P>CCCCLXX. As in single bleedings, so also in the whole quantity of blood to be taken, the sum should be a mean betwixt those, which the common run of physicians approve, while some think too much, some too little, should be taken. The reason for this recommendation is strengthened, by the consideration of there being now less occasion for shedding a great deal of the vital fluid, since the cure is now more divided among the other remedies that have been spoken of. The age must be regarded, as was formerly recommended<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See CCCCLV.</NOTE>, the former mode of life must be looked to, the quantity of stimulus, that may lately have preceded the morbid state, must be considered, and the state of the body compared with the degree of the symp∣toms and the effect of the cure. From those circumstan∣ces a judgment should be formed of bleeding and other eva∣cuations; and it should be estimated, what further of the same sort may seem proper to be put in practice, or what difference of management may be required. Upon the whole, it will be found, that there will be the less occasion for any one medicine, the more freely others have been brought into use; and it will be understood, that the dan∣ger of too great evacuation will be thereby avoided, and the health better secured<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See CCLXXXVI. and CCCV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXI. With respect to the kind of bleeding, it should always be made from a very large vein; because the cutting a lesser one, or opening an artery, does not afford a sufficient quantity for the relief of the vessels, and art<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riotomy is further attended with certain inconvenien∣ces<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">The blood is ready to break out again after the tying up; and if, as some advise, the arterial twig should be cut through, it diminishes the number of the few accesses to this mode of bleeding; neither does there seem to be any use in destroying such vessels, especially as no good pur∣pose can be shown for doing so.</NOTE>. As far as any certain rule, in an affair of such
<PB N="269" REF="022373_0283_0FB8688C09DBBE20"/>
varie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, can be established, two pounds of blood in three or four days, with the assistance of the other remedies, will, for the most part, be sufficient at the middle age of life, and less at a more early or later period.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXII. All bleeding should be followed by vomiting and purging, so long as any considerable part of the sthenic diathesis remains; nor should the other parts of cure, that have been pointed out, be neglected. But purging, a single dose of which can at any time, bring back a fit of the gout; which cures the sthenic cynanche or common inflammatory sore throat, and the mild erysi∣pelas, when even the face or head is affected; which is of manifest detriment in fevers; which, in dyspepsia, in as∣thma, and every sort of diseases depending upon debility, whether direct or indirect, does very great and conspicu∣ous mischief; and is a great part of the very bad, common method of cure over the whole form of asthenic diseases; in proportion as it ought to be avoided in all those diseases, should be as certainly laid hold of in sthenic diseases, and not omitted in any considerable one, such as those are that require bleeding, but be managed according to the direc∣tions given<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See CCCCLXI.</NOTE> lately, and as it was <HI>directed to be</HI> managed before<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">See CCLXXXIII.</NOTE>. And we must, above all things, be on our guard against that diffidence in the use of this remedy, as well as in that of vomiting, where they are seviceable, and that confidence in them when of disservice, both introdu∣duced by the spasmodic doctrine; and know that they were both admitted upon a false and absurd principle.<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">The principle, at least with respect to purging, was, that it dimi∣nished perspiration, and, therefore, was understood not to act as an an∣tispasmodic. A balance betwixt the excretion by the belly and that on the surface was talked of, and they were held for opposite operations. In such theoretical nonsense they deserted their only good leader, at least in those diseases, who alternated his bleedings and purgings, and, as I have found upon the best foundation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="022373_0284_0FB8689014CB0368"/>
CCCCLXXIII. As nothing in asthenic diseases has been more used than these two modes of evacuation, no∣thing with more hurt, and often with instantaneous de∣struction; so, for that very reason, nothing is more hap∣py and successful <HI>than their use</HI> in the cure of sthenic dis∣eases.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXIV. It is scarce credible to say, how far the aversion to the alexipharmac method of cure has had the effect of branding the very best medicines, what a de∣praved use of them it has suggested, and to what a degree it has perverted their proper use. Not to repeat what has been formerly said of that kind in other instances; sweat∣ing, which is of the highest service, and a most efficacious means of cure, in every moderate sthenic diathesis, in every degree of it, that is not the highest, or where it presses not upon any organ of importance to life; that is, in all the diseases of this form, except in the beginning of those of which we are here treating, has, however, of late been completely banished from the cure of every one of them, but one, not only, as useless, but as hurtful; which has chiefly happened since the spasmodic doctrine began to be received into this country, and, <HI>for a few years only,</HI> gradu∣ally to gain ground<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Turn back to CCCCLXIX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXV. But, in truth and fact, except rheuma∣tism (which, at least as produced by one form of a medi∣cine, it is allowed to cure), if it most certainly either re∣lieves or removes the sthenic cynanche, erysipelas itself, and catarrh, and the simple synocha, in proportion to the more free or sparing use of it; if that be known to the very vul∣gar,

and most certainly to physicians, of <HI>any other than the spasmodic</HI> practice; what reason, what certain and well pro∣ved fact, will any one bring, <HI>to show</HI> why sweating should not be used, after the most violent diathesis is much dimi∣nished by the other medicines, and is now reduced to that small degree, to which that remedy is adapted; what elo∣quence would be requisite to bring any man <HI>of sense</HI> into such a persuasion?</P>

vascular system has been freed from a violent stimulus, the diminution of excitement will not be more equal in all the vessels, and over the whole nervous system. If the nume∣rous vessels, that open into the intestines and into the sto∣mach, are so powerful in diminishing sthenic diathesis, how should a similar evacuation in the similar perspiratory ves∣sels have no tendency to produce the same effect? With which reasoning, if the facts just now related be further con∣joined, what will any person have to say against the use of sweating, when a degree of heat, not greater than what can∣not be avoided, attending the operation of the sweat, can no <HI>longer be hurtful, and the sweat itself certainly to be of great</HI> service<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">In an excitement of sixty-seven, within three degrees of indirect debility, the heat in the first part of the sweat, by adding these, might kill the patient, if you will, without leaving any chance of relief from its evacuant effect.

But what, again, is all this about? Will there never be an end of running from one extreme of error into the opposite? Shall no mean be found betwixt the Alexipharmac plan of cure, and an equally bad or worse one? If that doctrine hesitated not to pre∣scribe sweating in the rage of a peripneumony, and that too by means of the most heating stimulant powers; does it therefore follow that a plan of cure must be admitted, which rejects the certain and safe use of that remedy, when con∣ducted by the most gentle means? If it was the opinion of
<PB N="273" REF="022373_0287_0FB868950BAE99C0"/>
Dr. Sydenham, that heat should be avoided in the cure of sthenic diseases, <HI>which was quite right,</HI> as heat certainly en∣creases the excitement; are we, for that reason, to avoid that tolerable degree of heat, which accompanies a remedy the most powerful in restoring the healthy state, and, there∣by, deprive ourselves of great benefit upon the whole? If such persons did not know, that several remedies dimi∣nished excitement more powerfully than <HI>any</HI> one; and, if they were to be forgiven for that; were they also to be ex∣cused for not seeing, what any empiric might have seen, that is, that some things were of service, and others of disser∣vice; was that want not of genius, which is not required of them, but of common sense, also to be pardoned? If thinking without a leader, and making any sort of disco∣very, was too much, and not to be expected from them; is it not somewhat surprising, that out of a thousand per∣sons, who had treated of every part of medicine, and enter∣tained different sentiments from one another, in some mea∣sure right, and, no doubt, wrong too, they could squeeze no information, but always trod in the footsteps of one single man?</P>
<P>CCCCLXXVII. Sweat, therefore, after the manage∣ment that has been mentioned, is to be excited, and so much the more determinedly, if there should seem some∣thing still wanting to the complete return of health, some degree of sthenic diathesis still remaining, and a spontane∣ous tendency to it should appear.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXVIII. When the signs of a spontaneous sweat arising are perceived, nothing more is to be done, but first to lay the clothes about the patient, remove the sheets, put the blankets next to his body, guard against the ap∣proach of air, and keep up the discharge for a sufficient length of time, at least ten or twelve hours. If, by this management, there shall ensue a copious and universal flow of sweat, there will be no occasion for giving a me∣dicine.
<PB N="274" REF="022373_0288_0FB8689795116308"/>
After it has succeeded, and encreased the relief formerly procured; if it should sink in towards the end it, should at last be supported by Dover's powder, or by laud∣anum alone, covering the body, so as that it may get as quickly as possible to the surface, till the expected bene∣fit be obtained. And to this management it must be ad∣ded, that, if a draught of cold water be sometimes given, and then the body well covered up and properly managed, the business often succeeds to our wish. But, as in the o∣ther cases, that belong to this part of our indication, the sweating must then only be set on foot, when the medio∣crity of the diathesis, procured by the other remedies, will permit; so in the small-pox and measles, because there is occasion for a certain time to allow the matter to pass away, we must also keep that in our eye, and never be too early in making trial of this remedy. Lastly, if the heat should happen to prove hurtful, if at any time the flow of the sweat should be attended with less relief, or with some in∣convenience, it should be immediately stopped: For it was not for no purpose, but for that of making the reme∣dies supply the defects of one another, and of reducing the excitement more equally over the whole body, that a num∣ber was recommended.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXIX. In all the cases of a violent diathesis, all the remedies that have been mentioned, are more or less, and differently on different occasions, in proportion as the remaining part of diathesis may require, each in a larger or smaller quantity, to be brought into play, and the curative circle enlarged: And besides them,</P>
<P>CCCCLXXX. Some of slighter consequence, such as acids and nitre; some of uncertain <HI>use,</HI> such as leeching, cupping, and blistering, are mentioned, as of the first con∣sequence. Of these, the acids, in so far as they render the drink more agreeable, and, in an affection of the lungs do not produce cough, and prove, in a certain measure,
<PB N="275" REF="022373_0289_0FB86898C9B49E80"/>
refrigerant, are to be permitted; and more certainly, if there should be a desire for them. Every body should know, that the refrigerant power of nitre is less than is commonly thought. In rheumatism, and the sthenic cy∣nanche if the latter should be unusually severe, blisters, leeches, and cupping-glasses, applied in the neighbourhood of the inflamed parts, may, in some measure, be of ser∣vice. Nor does there seem to be any reasonable objection to the clapping a cap of recently dug-up earth upon the head in the case of phrenitis.</P>

<HEAD>The other Part of the Indication of Cure.</HEAD>
<P>CCCCLXXXI. To pass over to the other part of the Indication of cure<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">CCCC<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>L</NOTE>: When there is a gentler diathesis in the habit, as in the other phlegmasiae, and sthenic affecti∣ons, that have not been yet named <HI>in the cure;</HI> as in the mildest state of erysipelas, of the sthenic cynanche, catarrh, simple synocha, the scarlet fever, and the mild small-pox and measles; a smaller force of debilitating power is re∣quired; and, therefore, neither all the remedies that have been mentioned, nor in general so much of each, as in the other part are demanded.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXXII. In all these cases, not even with the exception of rheumatism, which depends upon a very great diathesis, bleeding is not necessary; and with the exception of that disease, bleeding, with any degree of freedom, is hurtful: For, when the excitement is not the greatest, and, on the contrary, is moderate, scarce exceeding that de∣gree that produces the predisposition to other diseases; in that case it is absurd to make use of a most debilitating power, by way of a remedy, as if we had to combate a ve∣ry violent disease. And, since the intention in bleeding is to prevent an ultimate excess of exciting power from
<PB N="276" REF="022373_0290_0FB8689A9C2035E8"/>
producing a cessation of excitement in death, an event of which there is not the least danger, in a moderate diathesis, such as that, which is the cause of the diseases here in ques∣tion; for that reason, the cure must be adapted to the cause, and bleeding must be either abstained from altogether, or very sparingly used.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXXIII. It is not, therefore, only in diseases of debility, which belong to the other form (in most of which it has, nevertheless, been, and still is, the custom, to spill more or less of the vital fluid); but also in all the diseases of this form, except the very violent ones, that the lancet is to be restrained.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXXIV. Though in rheumatism the diathe∣sis often runs considerably high, the usual profuse bleeding, is not, however, required. For, as every diathesis is always greater in some parts than in any other equal one, so it is with the sthenic diathesis <HI>in this case;</HI> which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound much greater upon the surface of the body, than in any other equal space within. And the reason is, that the most powerful noxious agent, heat, succeeding to cold, or so alternating with it, that its own stimulus is encreased by its effect<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">See XXXVII.</NOTE>, directs its principal energy to the surface of the body. Hence, after excessive bleeding, the disease, notwithstand∣ing, often obstinately recurs. The cause of which fact, if the principles of this doctrine be well understood, can∣not be obscure. Bleeding diminishes the sthenic diathesis chiefly in the red vessels, less in any of their extremities, least of all in the perspiratory vessels, and those disposed of in the tract of the muscles; and still less in the last, because the operation of the bleeding is counteracted by that of heat: Which is an explanation confirmed by the certain testimony of physicians; who often complain that their favorite remedy sails them.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="022373_0291_0FB8689BC8A0B998"/>
CCCCLXXXV. Upon which account, sweating, which we spoke of <HI>so</HI> lately, is remarkably adapted to <HI>she cure of</HI> this disease: To it, therefore, after a previous bleeding to twelve ounces, and observing the rule of tem∣perature and diet before directed, must we have immediate recourse, if the diathesis happens to be considerably vio∣lent, and is signalized by heat <HI>of the body,</HI> by pains raging most in the night time, and by a strong and hard pulse. In order to render the sweat universal, and of sufficient du∣ration, it should be brought out by Dover's powder, or laudanum, <HI>as before</HI> hinted, and kept up for twelve hours in full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low, and then some hours longer, or till the abate∣ment of the symptoms, in the form of a moisture or free perspiration, and repeated when the symptoms return. The rest of the cure must be entrusted to low diet and an exact temperature.</P>

In this case, after the sweating course, and also in that of a simple synocha, of the scarlet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever, of the sthenic sore-throat, of catarrh, erysipelas, and the gentle small-pox and measles, when the diathesis is somewhat considerable, but far short of that rage which constitutes the case of cure first taken notice off; we should use either a very small bleeding, and then chiefly the eva∣cuations before-mentioned<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">See CCCV.</NOTE>; then a slight and short sweat ought to be kept up not longer than eight or ten hours; and, during the whole time <HI>of the cure,</HI> we should go on with abstinence, weak drink, rest of body and mind, and cold, unless in the time of sweating, and even then, with as little heat as possible; and, finally, with tranquillity of mind, as these were formerly enjoined: The united use of which is perfectly equal to the removal of any of these diseases; but there will not always be occasion for them all.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="022373_0292_0FB8689EB0BE5CF0"/>
CCCCLXXXVII. Often so gentle a diathesis occurs, that one or two of them, once or twice employed, is suf∣ficient for the cure: So slight a diathesis that is, in which, unless for a little at first, the shivering, langour, and then heat, is very moderate, pointing out a proportional slight∣ness of diathesis upon the surface; in which there is scarce any lassitude, showing the same moderation of diathesis in the organs of voluntary motion; in which the vigour of the stomach remains, manifesting a moderate excess of ex∣citement in it; in which, in fine, the other functions, o∣ver the whole body are sufficiently calm, and only suffer conspicuously in the labouring part: In these cases, often a single purge with glauber's salt, often, without that, cold, rest, and abstinence, have conducted the morbid ex∣citement to its salutary degree. A thousand times has the sthenic cynanche, a thousand times has catarrh and the simple synocha, nay erysipelas itself with affection of the face, been in that way removed. And the scarlet fever is often so gentle as to yield to the same management.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXXVIII. In this way must a constant re∣gard be had to the degree of excitement and diathesis in the method of cure, and often terms must be disregarded. For, as it was with this view, that the simple synocha was before distinguished from the phrenitic, and the gen∣tle erysipelas from the violent; so, it often happens, that catarrh rises to that magnitude that threatens or brings on a peripneumony, and that the latter proceeds with much more gentleness than usual. In which circumstances, it is the degree of excitement alone, that ought to govern the physician, without respect to names.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXXIX. Another useful caution here is, to judge of the state of the pulse, of the temperature upon the skin, and of the skin in other respects, with good sense, and due reflection upon these principles. The frequency of the pulse in all sthenic diseases is moderate: With that
<PB N="279" REF="022373_0293_0FB868A069DC8D80"/>
there is conjoined some hardness and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulness. Whenever, therefore, the pulse is very quick, it is to be suspected, that the sthenic diathesis has passed into the asthenic, the excessive excitement into a cessation of excitement, or that the disease has been sthenic from the beginning. To re∣move which doubt and ascertain the truth, the habit of body, the age, must be considered, and an enquiry be made to know, whether the disease has been preceded, or not, by contagion. Heat of the skin is in common to these diseases and fevers, which are diseases of an oppsite stamp, and therefore a doubtful mark. Which, as it depends up∣on an interruption of perspiration, from whatever source, is never to be strained into a proof of the state of excite∣ment. And, since dryness of the skin, which is in com∣mon to the same diseases however different from each o∣ther, in the asthenic diseases depends upon debility; in order to know the amount of what that symptom means, the other symptoms and the exciting hurtful powers, should be considered. In fine, the only enquiry should be, whether the excitement is abundant or deficient, and all the signs should be consulted with that view; nor are we to judge rashly of any peculiar form.</P>
<P>CCCCXC. When, therefore, the signs, that have been related, are compared with all the rest and with the diathe∣sis, we are then to set about the antisthenic or stimulant plan of cure. The violent sthenic diseases, which we first considered can scarce be confounded with the contrary ones; the more gentle are daily confounded. But, while it is easy to distinguish them from the asthenic diseases re∣sembling them; if, however, any person should think the <HI>marks of</HI> distinction ambiguous, let him know, that, up∣on account of that gentleness, <HI>though the disease under exa∣mination should</HI> be asthenic, blood is not even to be let, much less <HI>under the apprehension that they may turn out</HI> asthe∣nic to which last so debilitating a power is destructive, as
<PB N="280" REF="022373_0294_0FB868A1C1ED1A60"/>
it has <HI>so</HI> often <HI>already</HI> been said upon former occasions; and, with that information, let him understand, that his method of cure <HI>conducted</HI> in that way, will be fenced and secured from all mistake. For, if the diathesis, though sthenic, be slight, bleeding will often precipitate it into the opposite, and will at the best be useless<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Suppose the diathesis be two degrees above the highest of the points of predisposition, at 57°; and bleeding to the degree of producing 35° of debilitating influence be employed; it is evident, the excitement will go down not only the 17° necessary to bring it to to the point of health, but sink to 22°, that is, 3° below the range of predisposition to asthenic disease, and therefore compleat the conversion of the sthenic into an ast∣henic disease.</NOTE>. If, on the contrary, the disease that passes for a sthenic one, should, in its progress, show itself an evident asthenic one; in that case every drop of blood that may have been taken will go to the encrease of the disease<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">See CCLXIX. CCLXXXI. CCXC.</NOTE>. Yet this perni∣cious and daily practice sends more men out of this world, than all the curses of human life<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCCVI. towards the end.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCXCI. As abstinence, cold, and the manage∣ment of the belly are sufficient to prevent a gentle state of the small-pox; so when that proper preparatory plan has been neglected, and now a crowded eruption appears; be∣sides those, trial must be made also of the other reme∣dies<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">CCCCLIII. to CCCCLXVIII.</NOTE>, except sweat. But sweat must be avoided, be∣cause the tendency of the stimulus accompanying it, by encreasing the sthenic diathesis on the surface, would be to check the perspirable fluid, and detain the contagious mat∣ter under the scarf-skin, and produce that pyrexia, symp∣tomatic of the inflammation, which is called the secondary fever. This particularity of cure is taken from the parti∣cularity of the symptom just now mentioned, and forms
<PB N="281" REF="022373_0295_0FB868A39C9DCE40"/>
no objection to the principles of this work. In perfect consistency with which, though there is all the proof that can be derived from sure practice, that the remedies we have mentioned are sufficient; yet, before the eruption comes on, there is nothing can be objected either to sweat∣ing or bleeding, as remedies in common to this with every other sthenic disease<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">The small-pox is, in one word, to be treated as any sthenic disease, according to its degree of morbid state, and the eruption is only to be re∣garded during the period of its existence, either with respect to the ex∣ception of sweating then, or of any thing else.</NOTE>. In fine, as the success of low di∣et, cold and purging, in this manner, is certain; at the same time, the other remedies, that remove sthenic diathe∣sis, in this case likewise operate to the same effect<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">It is not, that low diet, cold, and purging, operate by any peculi∣arity, but because they debilitate to the degree, and in the manner re∣quired, of the other remedies.</NOTE>. It was proper to say so much for the sake of showing the un∣exceptional steadiness and universality of the principles of this work. Nor are we to think, that the small-pox and measles, differ from other sthenic diseases attended with pyrexia, but in the particularity of their eruption in run∣ning a certain course, and not admitting of an accelerated cure.</P>
<P>CCCCXCII. We are not to wait the arrival of the symptoms of debility, that follow a violence of diathesis, and threaten certain death by indirect debility, with the view, forsooth, that, when they have happened, we may cure them: On the contrary, they ought to be prevented by the early administration of the remedies, <HI>now so</HI> fully commented upon. If that should be omitted, the consi∣deration of the diseases that will be the consequence, and which is altogether an asthenic consideration, must be re∣ferred to the asthenic form.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="022373_0296_0FB8651FCD391220"/>
CCCCXCIII. As often as sthenic diathesis happens to be conjoined with the pyrexia, which is induced by the operation of stimulants, of acrid substances, of compression, of obstruction, and similar hurtful powers acting upon a sensible part, of which we have examples in gastritis, en∣teritis, nephritis, cystitis, hysteritis, hepatitis, or the inflam∣mations of the stomach, of the intestines, of the kidnies, of the bladder of urine, of the womb, of the liver<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See LXXXI. LXXXIII. LXXXV. LXXXVII.</NOTE>; the diathesis, because it aggravates the pyrexia, should be re∣moved by its respective remedies, to wit, the debilitating ones. And, when neither it nor the asthenic diathesis is present, nothing should be attempted: But, if the asthenic diathesis should be present, which very readily may hap∣pen; the stimulant plan should be proceeded upon, to pre∣vent a very bad disease<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">As asthenic diseases to sthenic ones are in the proportion of nine∣ty-seven to three of the hundred; such also must be the frequency of predisposition to them: The inference from which is, that as we are seldom in the most perfect state of health, and consequently, for the most part, under some degree of predisposition, all the chances are greatly in favour of that predisposition being the asthenic one. Hence, the impro∣priety of treating all local diseases in the same way, and as if they were general sthenic ones. Death has been too often the consequence of that practice, when the local fault, for which it was intended, was no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, perhaps, than a thorn pushed under a nail, a cut, or contusion of a finger. In such circumstances, however fully the person may have lived, wine is withheld, fluid vegetable matter prescribed, and the routine of every species of evacuation gone through. Dismal are the consequences of gun-shot wounds on this plan of cure. Turn back to the paragraphs LXXX. and LXXXI. and the notes subjoined to them.</NOTE>. Nor, when that is as much as possibly attended to, are we to forget, that, in so doing, the principle affection is not touched; that, on the contrary, it is its effect, not its cause, that is tampered with; and that the full consideration <HI>of such cases</HI> belongs to the local diseases, afterwards to be taken notice of.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="022373_0297_0FB86520C5A3AE08"/>
CCCCXCIV. Besides all the remedies now mentioned, it is of advantage in every degree of diathesis to keep the mind easy and unruffled with passion or emotion; a prac∣tice that in the very high degrees of the diathesis is indis∣pensibly necessary. Our attention will especially be di∣rected to this particular, when we observe, that the stimulus of thinking and of any passion, carried to a great height, has had a share in the production of the disease.</P>
<P>CCCCXCV. In mania, therefore and pervigilium, this direction must be particularly, and as much as possible, at∣tended to. In the latter of which diseases, thinking, and every state of commotion, and more certainly an habitual practice in them, must be shunned, especially before go∣ing to bed. When the patient is resting there, he should have stupid books read to him, all inordinate desire, the propensity to revenge, the remembrance of every degree of criminality, of which he may have been guilty, should be diverted from his recollection<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See above CCCCXXXIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCCCXCVI. That fact of great consequence, to give corroboration to this whole doctrine, is confirmed by this other, that the same things, which are serviceable in pervi∣gilium, or the morbid watchful state, are also serviceable in mania, or madness, only administered in a higher degree, as that is a disease of a higher degree of excitement. Thus, it is not ease and tranquillity of mind that are to be pre∣scribed here, both of which are quite gone, but a state op∣posite to that high commotion <HI>of spirits</HI> and irregular vi∣gour in the exercise of the intellectual function: And, as an excessive energy of the intellectual powers, or of the animal spirits, or both, are the most noxious powers in this case; for that reason, the patient should be struck with fear and terror, and driven, in his state of insanity, to des∣pair: As a remedy against the great excitement of the or∣gans
<PB N="284" REF="022373_0298_0FB8652244009CC8"/>
of voluntary motion, the labour of draft-cattle should be imposed on him, and assiduously continued; his diet should be the poorest possible, and his drink only water<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See CCCXXVIII. CCCCXXX. CCCCXXXV. CCCCXXXVI.</NOTE>: In water as cold as possible, the patient should be immer∣sed, and kept under it, covered all over, for a long time, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is near killed.</P>
<P>CCCCXCVII. If, in phrenitis the brain, in peripneu∣mony the lungs, in rheumatism the external joints, possess more diathesis than any other part; why may not ma∣nia and pervigilium consist more in an affection of the brain, upon which the principal noxious powers act, than of the other parts, over which the influence of those pow∣ers is less considerable? Lastly, since remedies, the first action of which falls upon other parts, are of service in those diseases<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Part I. Chap. II.</NOTE>, that proves, that not even in them, where you might most be disposed to believe it, the whole morbid affection depends upon the part conspicuously af∣fected; but that the whole body is concerned in it, that the excitability is one uniform undivided property over all; that the force both of the exciting hurtful powers and of the remedies is directed to the whole, with the inequality so often mentioned<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Part I. Chap. IV.</NOTE>; and that the foundations of this doctrine are sure and stable.</P>
<P>CCCCXCVIII. As these are the principal hurtful powers in mania and pervigilium, and the brain principal∣ly affected; so in obesity, the hurtful powers most consi∣derable are animal food<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Because no effect can arise without a cause, the exciting powers, therefore, must here have operated with more force, than in the other case; and if it should be objected, that the circumstances in both cases were equal, the difference then must be set to the account of the greater vigour of the excitability in the case of obesity.</NOTE> and rest, or sedentary life; in consequence of which last, the stimulus of exercise, which,
<PB N="285" REF="022373_0299_0FB86527169138C0"/>
by wearying and fatiguing the body, tends to indirect de∣bility, is understood to be wanting. But, since, in con∣sequence of using the same food, both in quality and quantity, and the same <HI>indulgence in</HI> rest <HI>and case,</HI> some per∣sons become fat, others continue lean; from thence it is ascertained, that all the digestive powers have more force in the former, than in the latter, and consequently, that the other exciting hurtful powers have contributed to the effect, and that a proportional excitement follows. Of the hurtful powers, that belong to this place, an easy ex∣ercise of the intellectual faculty, <HI>and</HI> tranquillity of mind, which are moderate stimuli, favour obesity; over strained thinking, and habitual indulgence in passion, such as that of anger, <HI>the repetition of which constitutes</HI> ill nature, oppose it. Corporeal motion, which diminishes the quantity of fluids in the system, and, as often as it is con∣siderable, proves fatiguing and debilitating, opposes it. Equally unfavourable to it is hard drinking; which, in a similar manner, wears out the excitement, by constantly wasting the excitability from the high degree or long conti∣nuance of its stimulus. On the contrary, the powers that favour it, are those that act gently, and with some excess: but never attain that high degree of activity, that inclines to indirect debility: They are powers that go on softly and pleasantly, that particularly keep up moderation in the perspiration, and thereby fill the vessels with blood; but, because motion is avoided, they do not very much encrease the excitement of the vessels, and by means of the tran∣quillity of motion <HI>kept up in the latter,</HI> allow a fluid, that would otherwise pass off by the external pores of the sur∣face, to turn aside into the cells of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at. Hence, though, as it has been said before, an abundance of blood is indeed a very great stimulus; yet, without other stimuli, and that most powerful one, which muscular motion affords; it is evident, that a considerable degree of stimulus can be borne
<PB N="286" REF="022373_0300_0FB86529C8705EB0"/>
without any considerable disease, and that it always pro∣duces a predisposition to sthenic diseases, but does not immediately bring them on. Hence, it is understood what place in the scale of excessive excitement, or of sthe∣nic diathesis, obesity holds; what the degree of stimulant power is, and what the stimuli in particular, are that pro∣duce it.</P>
<P>CCCCXCIX. As the degree of curative force must be accommodated to the degree of force in the cause<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See CIX.</NOTE>; <HI>hence it must be observed,</HI> that for the cure also of this disease the common indication is sufficient<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">XLVIII. CCCCLIII.</NOTE>; that is, that the excess of excitement must be reduced to the salutary degree, and a remedy opposed to every hurtful power, equal to the re∣moval of it.</P>
<P>D. In this case, therefore, as food is the principal hurt∣ful power, less of it should be given, and more exercise en∣gaged in. These are sufficient for the cure<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">CCCCXCVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DI. But, for the sake of bringing both <HI>further</HI> confir∣mation, as well as illustration of this doctrine; it is to be observed, that all the powers, which very much affect the excitement, and in a greater degree, than the hurtful power of this disease mentioned above, and that have a tendency, <HI>by their stimulant operation,</HI> to indirect debility, have the same effect; that they either prevent or cure obesity, and continue productive of that effect, till <HI>they induce</HI> that de∣gree of meagerness which is connected with debility.</P>
<P>DII. The best method of lowering the diet, is to com∣bine a quantity of vegetable matter with a moderate por∣tion animal. The next <HI>rule</HI> to that, is to refrain from the latter, and use the former in greater abundance. The first of these is suitable to all such persons as are liable to diseases of debility, such as the gout, the indigestion that after a long time succeeds to luxury, asthma, epilepsy, and
<PB N="287" REF="022373_0301_0FB8652B9F251178"/>
similar others. The latter management is more accom∣modated to those, who otherwise enjoy great vigour, are under predisposition to sthenic pyrexia, and in the flower of their age. But, it is not, even in the latter state of the body, to be prosecuted, unless for a time; because, such is the debilitating influence of that practice, that, while it is sufficient to remove any degree of obesity, especially with the addition of exercise, it is found to have signal efficacy in producing asthenic diathesis, and all the diseases depen∣ding on that.</P>

<HEAD>PART THE FOURTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE SECOND FORM OF GENERAL DISEASES. OR THE ASTHENIC DISEASES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>DIII. THE form of asthenic diseases, and which is to be called asthenia, for the sake of distinguishing it from the form of sthenic diseases, which is called sthenia, is a state of the living body, in which all the functions are more or less weakened, often disturbed, almost always with a more conspicuous affection of some <HI>function.</HI> In the treatment of which, that order will be observed, in which the pro∣gress from the smallest disease <HI>of this kind</HI> to the greatest, through all the intermediate degrees, is to be followed out.</P>
<P>DIV. <HI>In</HI> this <HI>part of our subject,</HI> there occurs a great va∣riety of symptoms; of which, because it is without mean∣ing, and even misleading, no use is to be made in marking the scale of diseases. But, for the sake of placing what is about to be delivered in a clearer, if not a more specious, point of view, we shall begin with a simple enumeration of the principal diseases to be afterwards fully treated of.</P>
<P>DV. The asthenic diseases are macies, inquietude, or restlessness without sleep, the asthenic amentia, the scabby
<PB N="289" REF="022373_0303_0FB8652F09398AB0"/>
eruption, the slight diabetes, the asthenic scarlet fever, the rickets; the haemorrhaeae, or general bleeding dischar∣ges, such as menorrhaea, or a morbid excess of the men∣ses, epistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, haemorrhois, or the piles: and also three morbid states seemingly in ap∣pearance opposite to these, the loitering, impaired, or suppressed menstruation, next come thirst, vomiting, in∣digestion, diarrhaea, or loose belly, and colic without pain; after these the affections of children, as the worms, the general consumption, called tabes, dysentery and cho∣lera in the gentle state of these two; angina, the scurvy, the gentle hysteria, rheumatalgia, asthenic cough, cystirhae∣a, or mucus discharge from the bladder; the gout of strongish persons, asthma, cramp, anasarca, dyspepsia with pain, the violent hysteria, the gout of weakened persons, the hypochondriasis, dropsy, chin-cough, epilepsy, or the falling sickness, palsy, the lock-jaw, apoplexy, tetanus; lastly fevers, as the quartan, tertian, and quotidian, <HI>inter∣mittents</HI> or <HI>remittents,</HI> dysentery, and cholera, both in their violent degree, synochus, simple typhus, the gangrenous sore throat, the confluent small-pox, the pestilential typhus, and the plague.</P>
<P>DVI. This scale of asthenic diseases is to be understood <HI>in</HI> this way, that those diseases, which in their most usual state are slight, and claim a higher place in the scale, are sometimes more, sometimes most, violent; and those that in their most common state are severe, such as the gout of weakened persons, the pestilential fevers, and the plague itself, sometimes proceed with the greatest gentle∣ness<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCCL.</NOTE></P>
<P>DVII. The affections of parts, which often accompany those diseases, such as ulcer, tumor, encreased excretion, bleeding discharge, inflammation, spasm, convulsion, point out indeed some degree of debility <HI>as their cause,</HI> but in
<PB N="290" REF="022373_0304_0FB86532B8E5CFA8"/>
such sort that the same degree may happen without them. Hence, because it is the influence of debility that is funda∣mentally regarded in this scale; with the diseases, that are often conjoined with these affections, others, without them, as hysteria and the cramp are blended; and, with the cases that are accompanied with spasm and convulsion, dropsy is conjoined, by keeping to the idea of an equal de∣gree of debility; <HI>and all</HI> this without any regard to remar∣kable symptoms, but keeping the degree of debility only in view. Neither is the violent cholera kept back from its place among fevers, which last are distinguished by failure in the intellect and affections of the head, because it shews a degree of debility equal to the febrile. The idea in proportioning this division is to show, that true morbid energy does not consist in an affection of any parts, but of the whole body; and that the <HI>restoration of</HI> health is not to be attempted by a change of <HI>the state of</HI> parts only, but, <HI>without excluding that,</HI> by a change of the state of the whole system.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Leanness.</HEAD>
<P>DVIII, Leanness is an asthenia, less discernible in the other functions, but evident from the weakness of the di∣gestive function; in consequence of which, the system, though receiving proper aliment, does not become plump.</P>
<P>DIX. Since the cause of this disease is debility, both in the rest of the system, and in the stomach and other or∣gans of digestion; it thence <HI>follows, that</HI> the general indi∣cation for the cure of it, should be chiefly directed to the most languid part, that is, the organs of digestion and the perspiratory vessels. More nourishing food, therefore, should be used, less labour undertaken, and moisture on the surface, or too free perspiration, should be checked by more rest of body, by proper gestation, and rubefaction, and a
<PB N="291" REF="022373_0305_0FB86534C86AB578"/>
plan, quite contrary to that which is suited to the cure of obesity should be pursued.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Restless Watching.</HEAD>
<P>DX. In the asthenia called inquietudo, or restless watch∣ing, the other functions are under some degree of lan∣guor, and the patient is affected with a constant necessity to change his posture, and toss about his limbs without be∣ing able to fall asleep.</P>
<P>DXI. As the cause in this case, in the same manner as in every other general disease, is universal over the system; so its affects the organs of voluntary motion, and the brain in particular, with the inequality <HI>so often</HI> formerly menti∣oned<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See par. XLIX.</NOTE>: Consequently, <HI>to remove the disease,</HI> ultimate excess in either mental labour, or exertion in any passion, as well as the opposite extreme of deficiency <HI>in either,</HI> should be avoided; and that stimulus of both, which is agreeable, ultimately excessive corporeal labour when it has proved hurtful, as well as deficient when it has had a concern in the cause, should be guarded against; and the proper <HI>medium betwixt the extremes of excessive activity and indolence</HI> restored: Or the disease should be repelled by wine, and the other stimuli have, each its proportion, in the cure.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Scabby Eruption.</HEAD>
<P>DXII. In the scabby eruption, the face is pale, the skin discoloured, dry, lank, and variously disfigured with pustules; there is a lowness of spirits, and the functions of the body weak and sluggish.</P>
<P>DXIII. In this case, while the debility is universal, there is a prevalence of it in the perspiratory vessels. And, therefore, the chief parts of cure are, together with the re∣medies,
<PB N="292" REF="022373_0306_0FB86535EE9DEA08"/>
<HI>the operation of which is</HI> directed to the whole sy∣stem, such as nourishing food, strong drink, to support the perspiration by its respective remedies; to bathe the surface of the body in tepid water, to render it accessible to air, to order clean linen for the patient, and every thing clean about his cloths.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Gentle Diabetes.</HEAD>
<P>DXIV. In that asthenia, which is named the gentle diabetes, there is an excess in the quantity of urine dis∣charged, but the profusion is not immoderate as in the most violent case of the same name. The organ of respiration labours under the same weakness and sluggishness, as in the scabby eruption.</P>
<P>DXV. To remove this affection much more frequent than it has been hitherto believed the system should be sti∣mulated by food<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCLXVI.</NOTE>, by strong drink<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See CCLXVIII.</NOTE>, and by proper ex∣ercise<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">CCLXX.</NOTE>, such as is neither immoderately excessive, and therefore debilitating nor deficient in degree, and therefore, not supplying enough of stimulus: And, above all things, the perspiration should be sustained. The contrivances for checking the flow of urine, which have no existence, are to be passed from.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Rickets,</HEAD>
<P>DXVI. The rickets is an asthenia; to the general symptoms of which are added an unusual bulk of the head, especially the fore part of it, and likewise of the knees and abdomen, a flatness of the ribs and meagerness.</P>
<P>DXVII. The rickets is a disease of children, chiefly arising from uncleanliness, want of dandling or exercise, cold, either without moisture or with it, food not giving suf∣ficient nourishment, and bad air.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="022373_0307_0FB8653758533028"/>
DXVIII. For its cure the common asthenic indication must be employed; remedies, of an opposite nature to the hurtful powers that excite the disease, must be looked out for; the surface of the body should be kept clean<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See DXIII.</NOTE>, the perspiration should be carefully restored by the stimulus of pure air and of heat; the child should be more carefully dandled, and kept much in the open air, animal food should be administered, vegetable withheld, and strong drink al∣lowed<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See CCXCV. CCCIII.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Retarded Menstruation.</HEAD>
<P>DXIX. Retarded menstruation is also an, sthenia: In which, besides this discharge not making its appearance at that time of life, when it should, other evidences of debility, such as a slender make of body, weakness, laxity of habit, want of appetite, or a craving for things not alimentary, paleness of the skin, and similar symptoms, appear.</P>

<P>DXXI. Suppression of menstruation is that degree of asthenia, in which the discharge is totally stopt at any pe∣riod betwixt their natural commencement and the time when, in the course of nature, they cease altogether.</P>
<P>CXXII. An enquiry must be made into the cause of na∣tural menstruation, before <HI>it would be proper to enter upon</HI>
<PB N="294" REF="022373_0308_0FB8653A1B751550"/>
that of the retardation, or deficiency, of the discharge in any of its degrees.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Cause of Menstruation.</HEAD>
<P>DXXIII. The cause of menstruation is a conformati∣on of the vessels that pour out the blood <HI>in this discharge,</HI> taking place at a certain time of life, that is, about the age of puberty, and a stimulant energy in women, more power∣ful than in the females <HI>of the other species of animals.</HI></P>
<P>DXXIV. Of other animals there are very few, the fe∣males of which undergo any sort of menstruation out of the venereal orgasm.</P>
<P>DXXV. As all the vessels are gradually unfolded in the course of the growth of the body, so the same thing happens to the genital and uterine vessels, but last of all to these. The ends of the latter, terminating, on the sides of the womb about the age of puberty, are at last so very much expanded, as now to transmit first the serous part of the blood, and then, after an effort kept up for some time, pass to formal blood.</P>
<P>CXXVI. At this time of life a great change over the whole system takes place. Now the desire for coition, a stimulus, never experienced before, produces a commotion over the whole body; and, in preference to other parts, in the genitals of both sexes, in the female, over the whole region of the ovaria, womb, and vagina: By this stimu∣lus, the uterus, its seat, being nearly incessantly solicited, is the more powerfully affected, the more there is of exci∣tability, hitherto acted upon by no such stimulus, existing in the system. Hence, among other organs, the muscu∣lar fibres of the next vessels, as well as the nerves interwo∣ven with them, undergo the highest degree of excitement: This excitement encreasing over the whole system, again en∣creases that in the uterus: The mutual contact of the sexes,
<PB N="295" REF="022373_0309_0FB8653B17B19CE0"/>
whether in kissing, in shaking hands, or otherwise, fires both sets of genitals, and the uterus in a remarkable manner; but the actual embrace produces the highest degree of that effect. The remembrance of each embrace remains, renews the dear idea of the delightful scene, and continues more or less to excite the uterus.</P>
<P>DXXVII. This new affection is further cherished and nourished by every stimulus that is usually applied to the system: Hence, in the absence, in the presence, of the beloved object, at all times generally, scarce with the ex∣ception of <HI>that which passes</HI> in dreaming, a stimulus so stea∣dy, and the more powerful, that its novelty implies, that the excitability in this case is entire, rouses the fibres of the vessels, already sufficiently unfolded, to violent con∣tractions. The blood is carried into the region of the u∣terus with the greatest rapidity, a rapidity momentarily en∣creased, in proportion as the blood, by powerfully disten∣ding the vessels, and agitating them by its impetuous flow, stimulates the fibres more and more, and thereby encrea∣ses the activity by which it is driven on. This is the first cause of menstruation: In that way, the two circumstances, a sufficient enlargement of the diameters of the vessels, and the stimulus acting more powerfully, from its novelty, upon the unwasted excitability<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">See DXXIII.</NOTE>, are sufficient for the whole business.</P>
<P>DXXVIII. This state is not inconsistent with other states of the body, but bears an analogy to some well known ones: Accordingly, different vessels, from the <HI>mere</HI> differ∣ence of their diameters, are subservient to different pur∣poses: The perspiratory vessels are destined to the trans∣mission of a vapour, the excretory vessels of the alimentary canal to that of a thing fluid, the renal vessels to that of a grosser one; so as to take off our surprise at finding vessels
<PB N="296" REF="022373_0310_0FB8653F9F893630"/>
fitted, by their degree of diameter, for the purpose of trans∣mitting red blood.</P>
<P>DXXIX. The reason that the females of other animals do not menstruate but in their orgasm, and not at other times, is, that it is only at certain times that they are ex∣posed to that energy of stimulus which produces menstrua∣tion.</P>
<P>DXXX. How much is owing to the stimulus just now mentioned<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See DXXIII. DXXVI.</NOTE>, in the production of menstruation, is fur∣ther evident from the following chain of facts: Which are, that, the less addicted to love women are, the less they menstruate; the more they give way to that passion, the freer do they experience this discharge within certain boun∣daries; that, before puberty, and after the time of life when menstruation ceases (which are the two periods, at which the fitness for effective love has not yet commenced, or is now passed,) the menstrual discharge is constantly wanting; that the privation of enjoyment, which, by <HI>its</HI> debilitating <HI>effect,</HI> produces chlorosis<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">or the green sickness.</NOTE> and other similar diseases, is remarkable for bringing on a menorrhoea, or a retention of menstruation; and, finally, that girls, who are of a forward growth, of great strength, and large limbs, and consequently sooner ripe for love, are <HI>also</HI> more early in menstruation; while those, who are weakly, puny, and of a small size, and, consequently, later in attaining to the period of puberty, are proportionally late in attain∣ing the first menstrual discharge. Lastly, if, like all the other functions, that of love is limited at the same time by its duration and degree; and if, as the commencement of the love embraces is more or less early, it is proportionally more early or late in coming to its final termination, and if the duration of menstruation does not usually exceed that period; that fact also, <HI>which it certainly is,</HI> added to
<PB N="297" REF="022373_0311_0FB86541B8503E98"/>
those above, gives weight to our conclusion, and shows, in a clearer point of view, how much menstruation de∣pends upon the venereal emotion. It is to be asserted, therefore, again<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">DXXIII. DXXVI.</NOTE>, that, besides the conformation of the vessels, suited to <HI>the function of</HI> menstruation, and the stimu∣lus which has been mentioned(k), there is occasion for no other <HI>circumstance to explain</HI> either commencement, esta∣blishment, or continuation, of the menstrual discharge.</P>
<P>DXXXI. The cause of full menstruation, and that of a moderate degree of it, happening within the boundaries of health, is the same; only differing in degree; the degree of the latter being smaller, and that of the former greater.</P>
<P>DXXXII. And, as the stimuli, mentioned above, ex∣plain, why women menstruate more than the females of other animals; so their immoderate operation upon wo∣men serves to show, why <HI>their effect,</HI> the menstrual dis∣charge, becomes greater than natural<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Women menstruate more than other females, because they are sub∣jected to a higher degree of the stimulus, which is its cause; and such women as are exposed to more of the same stimulus than others, will al∣so experience more of the effect, precisely upon that same principle.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DXXXIII. The stimuli that produce abundant men∣struation, short of morbid state, are unchaste ideas, and a high energy of passion. In this way, the influence of reading to ones' self, or to others, of conversation, of pictures, contrived to kindle up lustful appetite, and the uncovering of parts that modesty conceals, which all pro∣duce a lively impression on the imagination of the thing so much desired; can be indistinctly felt by none perhaps but eunuchs. The same is the effect of nourishing food, and generous drink, and high seasoning; and hence the pro∣verb, without meat and drink love starves: Likewise, that degree of exercise, or <HI>even</HI> labour, that does not prove fa∣tiguing, but that keeps within the boundary of stimulant
<PB N="298" REF="022373_0312_0FB865429DEFD180"/>
operation; as also an abundance of blood, both from that circumstance and from rich diet; lastly, frequent and ar∣dent dalliance, or <HI>inconcessa bujus imitatio;</HI> all these, en∣crease the menstrual discharge, in proportion to the high degree of their stimulus, but still do not carry their effect to morbid excess.</P>
<P>DXXXIV. The same conclusion applies to the effect of these stimuli, which was formerly applied to an over-proportion of blood producing sthenic diathesis: For the ultimate end of all the stimuli, that produce excessive menstruation, is such, that, if excessive menstruation and an encrease of love be the consequence of the excess of the stimuli, one or other of the following must be the effect: that is, it will either be such as remains within the lati∣tude of health, or such, as first produces sthenic diathesis, and then, in a higher degree of it, runs rapidly into indi∣rect debility.</P>
<P>DXXXV. That this is the fact, is proved by the hurt∣ful powers that produce excessive and morbid menstruation; and by remedies, that are stimulant and suited to fill the vessels, removing the disease according to our late discove∣ry; and also by the unfortunate effect of the debilitating evacuant plan of cure in the same diseases.</P>
<P>DXXXVI. As it is stimulant operation that produces both proper menstruation and that which goes to a little excess; so, when once menstruation is established, the con∣formation and stimulus, that have been mentioned, re∣maining, are sufficient to support it. The same opera∣tion is renewed during every interval of menstruation: The stimulus acts and quickens the motion of the blood in eve∣ry part, but chiefly in that where it is most powerful and most required, that is, in the region of the womb: The blood thrown into quick motion, and rushing with a more rapid flow, encreases its cause, the stimulus: And, as this mutual stimulus continues incessantly to affect the
<PB N="299" REF="022373_0313_0FB8654406CB22C0"/>
women through the whole interval, when they are allowed scope of love; the uterine vessels are gradually unfolded, till at last, within three weeks, or a lunar month, they are opened to their ultimate extremities: And, when the fluid, first serous for a little, and afterwards sanguine, and afterwards serous again for a little, has flowed one, two, or three days, in healthy persons, the vessels are at last shut up.</P>
<P>DXXXVII. During the whole time of this process, the more excitability there is, and consequently at the begin∣ning of each menstrual effort, the more violently the sti∣mulus acts, and produces proportionally more excitement: And it has, from this time, always less and less effect to the end, in proportion as the excitability is more wasted; though, till the excitability, in so far as it has a relation to the stimulus, is altogether exhausted, the stimulus always adds something to the sum of excitement,<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">See XXXVI.</NOTE>, though con∣stantly less and less. The same is the explanation of the operation of food, of drink, and of all the exciting pow∣ers.</P>
<P>DXXXVIII. As what has been said of the stimulus, productive of menstruation, is conformable to the effects of all the other stimuli; the same is its conformity to the whole sum of menstrual effect from the beginning to the end of the process. Thus, in the beginning of that long period, the force of stimulus is far the greatest, upon ac∣count of its novelty, and the unwasted state of excitability that relates to it. At this period, above all others, love in persons in health is exquisite; and, in consequence of the stimulus which excites it, menstruation, when once esta∣blished, is most exactly performed; that is, it does not, either from deficiency or excess, deviate into morbid state.</P>
<P>DXXXIX. But after the beginning of this function, and when now the office of menstruation is established;
<PB N="300" REF="022373_0314_0FB8654A3468A040"/>
because in this, as well as every other function, the exci∣tability is gradually diminished in the progress of life, the stimulant power also has gradually less, and, at last, no effect: Consequently, in the same gradual way, the power of love in women, and, in proportion, that of menstrua∣tion, is diminished, and at last altogether extinguished.</P>
<P>DXL. While both the faculties, that of love as well as that of menstruation, in this way decrease from the begin∣ning to the end; so, menstruation is often interrupted, in pregnancy, in suckling, in the diminution or suppression of menstruation. This interruption in the two former i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> natural, and suitable to health; <HI>but</HI> in the diminution or suppression of the menstrual evacuation, it becomes mor∣bid.</P>
<P>DXLI. Since the stimulus with the conformation of the vessels is the cause of menstruation, and the latter depends upon the former; so again the defect of the stimulus, and, therefore, of the conformation, produces both the retar∣dation, diminution, and, at last, the complete suppression of the discharge.</P>
<P>DXLII. Whether ever the defect of menstruation, like that of perspiration, or of any internal excretion, as that in the fauces and alimentary canal, is sometimes to be im∣puted to sthenic diathesis, is uncertain, for this reason; that, while the diameters of the small vessels on the skin and in the intestines are more nearly allied to such a contraction for a reason <HI>formerly</HI> assigned<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">LVII. LXII. CXII. CXIII.</NOTE>; so great a force of excite∣ment, so high a degree of sthenic diathesis, as would be suf∣ficient to shut up vessels destined to the transmission of blood, is not easy to be conceived. And the doubt i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> further encreased by <HI>a certain fact; which is,</HI> that both in the retardation of the menstrua, and in all the degrees of their diminution to their total suppression, when local af∣fection
<PB N="301" REF="022373_0315_0FB8654B89DF5BE8"/>
is out of the question, there are evident proofs of a debilitating cause.</P>
<P>DXLIII. To ascertain that fact, which is of the great∣est consequence for this reason, that it directly interests the method of cure, and, if not explained, would leave a gap in our principles; <HI>we have to observe,</HI> that, as some men, in consequence of the stimulus of excessive love, in the case of a most beautiful woman being the subject of it, have, by means of sthenic diathesis, been so inflamed as to fall into a temporary fit of impotence, and been cured by bleed∣ing; so, besides that that is a rare fact<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">I remember one instance in Dr. Whyte, and I think I have only heard of another.</NOTE>, it is not very pro∣bable, that the patulous uterine vessels can be so contracted in their diameters, as to be incapable of transmiting their fluid. Nay facts contradict it: The retardation or defici∣ency of menstruation receive a temporary alleviation from the debilitating plan of cure; but the discharge is not usu∣ally also brought back, on the contrary it is more kept off: But allowing an over-proportion of blood and an excess of stimulus to be the cause of the first deficiency of menstru∣ation, after it has been removed by bleeding and the rest of the debilitating plan of cure, can it again be the cause of a disease, which resists a degree of evacuant and debili∣tating plan of cure, that would cure ten peripneumonies? And since any stimulus, as well as <HI>that of</HI> an over-propor∣tion of blood, may, from its excessive force, go into indi∣rect debility; why may not the same thing happen in a disappointment in love, and first deficiency of menstruati∣on; and, in both cases, atony, ushering in manifest debili∣ty, and not excess of tone, be the cause? As peripneumo∣ny, where the over-proportion of blood and sthenic diathe∣sis is by far the greatest <HI>that ever happens,</HI> in consequence of indirect debility passes into hydrothorax; why may not a similar cause in this case produce a similar effect?</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="022373_0316_0FB8654D08AA8950"/>
DXLIV. The cause, then, of deficient menstruation, whether partial or complete, is a languid excitement over the whole body, especially in the uterus, from a deficien∣cy of the stimulus of love<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">DXXIII. DXXVI. DXXIX.</NOTE>, and of all those stimuli that support it<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">DXXVI. DXXVII. DXXXII. DXXXVII.</NOTE>, and from a penury, or under-proportion of blood.</P>
<P>DXLV. That that is the fact, is proved by the hurtful powers mentioned in the retardation of menstruation, and other debilitating ones in every deficiency of that discharge, producing each disease; it is proved by the stimulant and filling plan of cure removing it, and also by the hurtful effect of the debilitating plan of cure<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">DXXXV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DXLVI. The remedies for the cure of retarded men∣struation are, rich food, generous drink, gestation, exercise accommodated to the strength, pediluvium and semicupi∣um, or the warm bath of the under-extremities, and grati∣fication in love<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">DXXVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DXLVII. The same remedies are required for the suppression, and the same, but inferior in their degree of force, for the diminution of menstruation: When there is an unusual force of the disease, either in degree or durati∣on, we must have recourse to the assistance of the diffusible stimuli.</P>

<HEAD>Of Menorrhoea, or the excessive Discharge of Menstruation.</HEAD>
<P>DXLVIII. Menorrhoea is an effusion of blood from the uterus, or an over-copious menstruation, or too long a continuance of it in a more moderate degree of the excess, accompanied by all the symptoms of asthenia.</P>
<P>DXLIX. This disease is occasioned not by an over-pro∣portion of blood, not by a vigorous state of body, but by
<PB N="303" REF="022373_0317_0FB8654EC42A7F70"/>
an over-proportion of the former, and an exhaustion of the latter. The hurtful powers, therefore, that produce it, are food not nourishing enough, or too small a proporti∣on of what is so, watery drink, or that over-proportion of pure strong drink that produces indirect debility, exces∣sive heat, or cold not prevented from its debilitating opera∣tion by any stimulus, and salacity.</P>
<P>DL. Its remedies are the reverse of the hurtful powers; rich food, generous strong drink, heat acting within its stimulant range, cold kept from direct debility by the stimulus of heat and other stimuli, and gratification in love.</P>

<P>DLV. The cause of the piles is manifest, from the hurt∣ful powers producing it, the remedies removing it, and the unhappy effect of the common asthenic plan of cure; that
<PB N="304" REF="022373_0318_0FB865507614B618"/>
is to say, it is debility of the whole body, from the defici∣ency of other stimuli, and chiefly that of the blood<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">See par. DXLIX.</NOTE>; Which debility, while it relaxes all the vessels, and impair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their tone, produces that effect, in a special manner, upon the labouring vessels.

Its most frequent source by far is weakness, being the at∣tendant sometimes of too long suckling, sometimes of the diarrhoea incident to women, wasted with a long course both of that and repeated pregnancies.</P>
<P>DLVII. There are two causes of as many affections which have got only one name between them, that of thirst: The one is sthenic, the other asthenic<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The former arises from the stimulus of salt, of rich and plenti∣ful

meals, of heat and labour, and some others; never ending in vomiting till the sthenic state is over, which is seldom. Its cure, with which we have here no concern, is cold water and the several debilitating powers.</P>
<P>DLVIII. The asthenic thirst, which is our present subject, depends always on pure debility, sometimes in∣direct, sometimes direct<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">CLXXXV.</NOTE>. Its tendency is always to stomach sickness, and, as that encreases, to vomiting<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See CLXXXVII. CLXXXVIII.</NOTE>; and when the vomiting becomes any way considerable, the consequence is that most acute pain, which a cramp in the stomach produces<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See par. CLXXXIX.</NOTE>, and the other affection formerly explained<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">CXC. to CXCV. and from that to CXCVIII.</NOTE>. This progress is spontaneous, direct, and for the most part rapid.</P>
<P>DLIX. The hurtful powers here are all debilitating. The indirectly debilitating hurtful powers are, debauch in eating and drinking<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">CXXVIII.

The following pow∣ers act by a directly debilitating operation; cold corrected by no stimulus<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">CXXII.</NOTE>, cold drink, vegetable food<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">CXXVIII.</NOTE>, penury of blood<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">CXXXIV.</NOTE>, of other fluids<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">CXXXVII.</NOTE>, want of pure air<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">CXLVI.</NOTE>, anxie∣ty, grief, fear<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">CXLIII.</NOTE>, and in fine, that weakness of the system, which arises from all those. The affection is often of a mixt origin, from a mixture of both these sorts of hurtful powers: For, as direct debility always increases the indirect, so does the latter the former, both in this and all cases<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">XLVII. LXXI.</NOTE>.</P>

DLX. A corruption of the common mass of fluids, whether it be called acrimony, or putrefaction, has no con∣cern in the cause; because, while life remains, and the ac∣tion of the vessels upon their respective fluids continues, such a faulty state of the fluids cannot make its havock over such an extent of the system, that being only the effect of a cessation of motion of the fluids under heat; nor can it happen, but in the extreme vessels and excretory ducts, which, by their atony, do occasion such a cessation of mo∣tion, and likewise in the alimentary canal.</P>
<P>DLXI. The cause of this thirst is the common one of every asthenia, but predominant in the throat and stomach, upon account of the atony of the salivary, and other excre∣tory ducts<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">CLXXXVI. CLXXXVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DLXII. The remedies are also the common ones of every asthenia, to be accommodated to the degree of debi∣lity in the cause. In a slighter degree of thirst a glass or two of brandy, or of any similar spirit, or, which is a better rule, given till the complaint is removed, is sufficient. It should be either pure, or diluted with a very little hot wa∣ter<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">The addition of cold water counteracts, that of hot co-operates with, the effect, which has been ascertained in a thousand trials.</NOTE>. That should be followed by eating some animal food<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">When the thirst was but just coming on, and not yet established, I have found a hearty breakfast carry it off.

In all those cases recourse must be had to a larger dose of the drink: And, when that does not succeed to our wish, we must next fly to opium, and other more diffusible stimuli, if they are not to be found: When, by these, relief is procured, rich and pure soups, without grease, should, from time to time, be poured in, and the canal carefully bathed all over with them.

<P>DLXXI. The hurtful powers, producing all those af∣fections, are in common to them with every asthenia; that is, they are every thing that has an effect of debilita∣ting the whole system, and especially the alimentary canal: Such as, at this age, are, milk not nourishing enough, and at the same time acescent and flatulent; want of food, or made of watery matter and bread; cold, and moisture, the latter encreasing the effect of the former; habitual vo∣miting and purging; too little dandling; mistiming sleep, and meals, and every part of management; nastiness; im∣pure air; a neglect of natural likings and dislikings.</P>
<P>DLXXII. The remedies are the converse of all those, nourishing exciting milk; three or four meals a day, con∣sisting chiefly of warm milk, pure animal soups, not weak, with a mixture of flower of bread of the same kind; heat without being carried so far as to produce sweat, or too much redness, and free from moisture; laying aside every sort of evacuation; a great deal of dandling and gestation; a proper timing of sleep, of food; and of every part of ma∣nagement of these delicate systems; cleanliness; tepid ba∣thing in cold weather, and cold bathing in warm; and pure air, being out in the fields as often as possible in all but moist weather; such a judicious attention to desires and propensities, as not to neglect scratching any part that itches<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See above DXVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DLXXIII. These directions suit the gentler cases <HI>under consideration.</HI> To remove the more violent, while they also are not by any means to be neglected; at the same time others are to be subjoined.

<P>DLXXIV. If those should not succeed to the <HI>physician's</HI> mind, which will seldom be the case; in the same affec∣tions, and more certainly in worms, and still more certainly in the tabes, or general consumption, with the remedies that have been spoken of, the more diffusible stimuli of opium and musk should be alternated. Both sorts of re∣medies<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">The durable and diffusible.</NOTE>, should be so accommodated to the violence of the symptoms, as not to be dropped till the whole morbid tumult is allayed, and the healthy state replaced; which will, upon trial, be found more practicable, than has yet been imagined from the employment hitherto of the con∣trary plan of cure, to the great comfort of mankind in their sufferings.</P>
<P>DLXXV.

The un∣happy termination of them hitherto, is to be imputed not to their cause, but to the depravity of the common method employed for their cure<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">I cannot help repeating again, because the importance of the sub∣ject calls upon me to do so; that the practice of the new plan of cure, in all the diseases of children, as well as in the others lately spoken of, has ever succeeded in my hands, as well as in those of my pupils, to a miracle.

<HEAD>Of Scurvy.</HEAD>
<P>DLXXVII. Scurvy is an evident asthenia: The prin∣cipal symptoms of which are, want of appetite, loathing
<PB N="312" REF="022373_0326_0FB865638987A6C8"/>
of food, laxity of the living solids considered as simple so∣lids; an oozing of blood, both from other parts, and par∣ticularly from the gums; aversion to labour; low spirits, and a languor in all the functions.</P>
<P>DLXXVIII. The hurtful powers producing this dis∣ease, are the common asthenic ones, appearing in the fol∣lowing form: It is cold in this case, but conjoined with moisture in the northern seas, and, as <HI>we may well suppose,</HI> in the parts of the southern ocean of the same temperature, that generally produces the peculiar form of the disease. But with it all the other debilitating powers contribute their share: Such are, grief for the loss of liberty, relations, kindred, and friends; a horrid dislike to their present state of life; a longing desire for that which they have parted with; the awe which the severity of discipline keeps them in; <HI>the effect of</HI> a calm, where there is nothing to do, pro∣ducing direct debility on them; a storm, where they have to labour above their powers, <HI>as certain a cause of</HI> indirect debility; their not having been allowed, till o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, fresh meat, which is the only nourishing and envigorating<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See CXXIV.</NOTE> <HI>form of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> their being kept upon salted and spoiled meat, and not even corrected by recent vegetable aliment, such as that is<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See CXXVIII.</NOTE>; watery or small drink; the terror which the expectation of a battle at sea inspires.</P>
<P>DLXXIX. All those particulars prove, that scurvy is so far from being the effect of one or two hurtful powers, and from resting upon so narrow <HI>a basis of</HI> the cause <HI>pro∣ducing it,</HI> as has hitherto been imagined; that it is rooted in a multiplicity of debilitating powers, and is a real ast∣henia, <HI>or universal disease of debility.</HI></P>
<P>DLXXX. And this fact is confirmed by both the true and false method <HI>employed</HI> for its cure: For, though nearly all the common powers concur in the production of scurvy; if, however, it be considered, how easily, upon the remo∣val of the hurtful powers, and the patient getting a shore,
<PB N="313" REF="022373_0327_0FB865666BC7B3E0"/>
the disease is got under, by fresh meat, either with or with∣out greens, by wine, gestation, and exercise, in fine, by the recovery of his usual manner of living; it will be impos∣sible to entertain a doubt of its being both an asthenia, and by no means a violent one. The pretence of its cure being effected by greens, roots, sour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rout, and similar things, so much boasted of lately, which, without the remedies just now enumerated, could not fail, by their debilitating ope∣ration, to aggravate the disease, is derived from a noted blunder among physicians, by which they are led to over∣look the most certain, simple, and evident facts, and take up in place of them, the greatest falsehoods, or such facts as have a very narrow foundation in truth.</P>

<HEAD>Of the gentle Hysteria.</HEAD>
<P>DLXXXI. The gentle hysteria is a form of asthenia, of frequent occurrence among women, but very rarely hap∣pening to men; in which a noise is heard in the belly, and the patient has a sensation of a ball rolling within <HI>the bowels,</HI> rising up to the throat, and there threatening the patient with suffocation.</P>
<P>DLXXXII. The striking symptom in this disease is a spasm, not fixed in a part, but running the course <HI>just now</HI> described. The disease attacks in fits, for the most part leaving long intervals betwixt them, and often never recur∣ring more than once or twice.</P>
<P>DLXXXIII. The fits are soon removed by small doses of opium, repeated at short intervals: The intervals should be secured from danger by full diet, and a moderate and na∣turally stimulant management.</P>

spontaneous course, as of the profusion of blood and of other fluids employed for the cure of it, and of too debili∣tating a cure; with a change of the sthenic diathesis and the inflammation, which is a part of that, into the asthenic dia∣thesis and inflammation. Paleness of the skin takes the place of complexion: The appetite is diminished, the involuntary motions are impaired, debility and torpor pre∣vail over all. So far the disease is understood to be chronic. As in rheumatism, the joints are pained and inflamed: As that, which has been assigned, is the most frequent cause of rheumatism, so it sometimes arises not from a sthenic origin, and an excess in the means of reducing that.</P>
<P>DLXXXV. The cause of the disease is the usual one of any asthenia, predominant in the moving fibres of the muscles, situated below the skin over the whole surface of the body.</P>
<P>DLXXXVI. Its worst morbific powers are, penury of blood, cold, especially with the addition of moisture im∣pure air, and besides these, as many of the other powers that act by a debilitating operation as happen to be applied, contribute, in proportion to the degree in which they are applied to the morbid effect. Of these excessive indolence and the reverse are particularly hurtful.</P>
<P>CLXXXIII. As all stimulants contribute to the resto∣ration of the healthy state; so the most powerful of them in this case is nourishing food, friction, gestation, wine, taken in moderation, exercise, rather frequent than violent, and being as much as possible in the open air. If it is an acknowledged fact, that rheumatalgia is one of the reproach∣es of physicians, it is more so than has been hitherto un∣derstood; it being an asthenic disease, while they at all times made use of the same kind of cure, as if it had been

the most sthenic, or even upon the whole more debilita∣ting<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">If they should pretend to say that their bleeding and other evacu∣ations were more moderate that in rheumatism; the answer is, that they were not so profuse at any given time: But, considering the length of time, that rheumatalgy draws out into, the frequent, and almost con∣stant evacuations, conjoined with every species of inanition, made the debilitating practice upon the whole far exceed that used in the sthenic case. No wonder, then, that much mischief was done.</NOTE>.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Asthenic Cough.</HEAD>
<P>DLXXXVIII. The asthenic cough is an asthenia, which with the constant symptoms of the latter, depends upon a frequent expectoration, that the cough excites; af∣fecting every age which has been under the influence of ei∣ther direct, or indirect debility, and therefore old age, which is unavoidably the prey of indirect debility.</P>
<P>DLXXXXIX. As consisting in indirect debility, it is the effect of an excessive violence of all stimuli that have been applied either for a short time, or for a great part of life, their operation coming to the same amount, that of the former from its degree, and that of the latter from its long continuance<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See above XXIX. XXX. and CCCCI.</NOTE>. In so far as its cause is direct deblity, a deficiency of all the stimuli, leaving the excitability to be accumulated, allows this form of asthenia to happen from the spontaneous tendency of nature, of which life is only a forced state<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">So great is nature's tendency to that particular encrease of exerti∣on; which forms the matter of expectoration in this disease, that every case of death from disease is an instance of it. Hence the dead rattle in the throat is universally the expiring symptom. See LXXII, and CCCXXVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DXC. The cough, which depends upon indirect debi∣lity, is cured by reducing the stimulus which occasioned it, gradually and cautiously to the proper and natural degree
<PB N="316" REF="022373_0330_0FB8656DCD5D4B90"/>
And when it originates from indirect debility, the encrease of the stimulus, <HI>the want of which occasioned the disease,</HI> till the degree of excitement, which constitutes health is repla∣ced, effects the cure.</P>
<P>DXCI. Such is the nature of direct and indirect debi∣lity; that if the remedies of the former be pushed beyond the boundary, the cough appears again; and the same is the event of the same excess in the use of the remedies of the latter<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See par. XXXIII. XXXIV. and XLIII. XXX. CXXXIV. and especially CCXXXIII. to CCXXXVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DXCII. Frequent and violent cough with copious ex∣pectoration has been always held for a sure mark of a vi∣tiation or faulty state in the lungs. That faulty state was esteemed to be of a sthenic nature, and to give assurance of the presence sometimes of phthisipneumony, or consump∣tion from an ulcer in the lungs, sometimes bastard peri∣pneumony, sometimes of a burning inflammation in the alimentary canal. In the former case an ulcer, or, in their way of speaking, and what amounts to the same thing, tu∣bercles were believed the cause of the disease; in the se∣cond case inflammation either in the intercostal muscles, or a different one from that, which in true peripneumony was, in their opinion, its primary cause, was considered as the cause; and in the last case, no one of them would have hesitated a moment to have ascribed the state of the bowels, to the only inflammation they were acquainted with, that which requires bleeding and evacuation for its cure. And no other enquiry was made, but whether the matter that was spit up, was mucus or pus. To ascertain that premiums were proposed.</P>
<P>DXCIII. But, in fact, besides that no phthisipneumony, no bastard peripneumony, as they call it, no inflammation in the alimentary canal, was ever cured by antisthenic
<PB N="317" REF="022373_0331_0FB8656F02BA41E8"/>
or debilitating remedies; and that, in the several trials tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have yet been made, the first of these cases has been evi∣dently assisted, nay frequently completely removed, and the two latter throughly cured in numberless instances, and in all in which it has been used by the sthenic, or stimu∣lant plan of cure; I say, besides these large and compre∣hensive facts, so little signification is here, either in the quantity or appearance of the expectoration, that in cer∣tain fevers, in other diseases of debility, quite free of all local affection, and finally in this very cough of which we are speaking, there is often a more violent cough, and a greater expectoration of matter putting on every form and every appearance, than usually happens in a confirmed consumption, and where every hour is expected to be the last. And yet the whole tumult, hitherto so alarming, could be stopt in a few hours, and quite cured in as many days.</P>
<P>DXCIV. And, who does not know, that there are many persons, who have an immoderate cough, and pro∣portional expectoration for a whole and long life time, whose lungs, however, are sound, and free from any or∣ganic taint? How often in phthisipneumony itself after finishing its course, and at last terminating in death, has the whole fabric of the lungs been found upon dissection as sound as ever happens in death from any cause<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">There are several cases upon record, of the lungs after death from a confirmed consumption, having been found perfectly sound. A most respectable pupil of mine went to Lisbon with a young gentleman of considerable rank in Scotland, under a confirmed consumption, whom he brought back perfectly freed from his disease. He also saved either two or three ladies, I am not just now sure which; equally given up up∣on the common practice. He happened to assert before the physician of the factory, that a person just dead of the same disease had no local af∣fection in the lungs, and upon dissection it was found to be as he had said. I have restored many phthisipneumoniacs, but am obliged to own, that I have lost three, to whom I was called too late. Their loss, how∣ever mortified me, because there were many reasons for my setting my heart upon their cure. I also lost in Edinburgh the most amiable young man of that kingdom, after curing a prodigious hemorrhagy from his lungs▪ This was he whom my pupil two years before brought home safe from Lisbon. But I was permaturely dismissed in this, and counter∣acted, in the other cases.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="022373_0332_0FB86570A06AC078"/>
DXCV. The cause of cough has hitherto been un∣known. To pass over the sthenic cough, with which we have nothing to do in this part of our subject<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See CLX. CCXXXIII.</NOTE>; the cause of the asthenic is the same as that of any asthenia, but more vehement in the fountain of expectoration, to wit, the exhalant and mucus arteries, the secreted fluids of which, inspissated by stagnation <HI>in the bronchia,</HI> compose the matter to be expectorated.</P>
<P>α▪ α▪ The most powerful of the asthenic hurtful agents in exciting asthenic cough, is cold, just as heat has been demonstrated the most hurtful agent in catarrh<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCCVII. to CCCCXII.</NOTE>. Nay, in the asthenic cough, such is the rage of cold, that the slightest breath of air reaching the body, excites a most pro∣digious tumult of coughing, and brings out the whole se∣ries of subsequent symptoms; and heating the body in the bed as soon allays the cough, prevents the threatening, and cures the urgent disturbances.</P>
<P>DXCVI. In this as well as the sthenic cough, it is the serous and mucous fluids that chiefly flow to the bronchia. Which bear their pressure for a little, till, distended by the load, they can bear it no longer. The disagreeableness of the stimulus excites a commotion in the excitability of the labouring part, and, therefore, over its whole seat, and rouses the excitement. A cough arises, and throws off its cause, the collected humours.</P>
<P>DXCVII. This disease is always to be treated for its cure, first with stimulant remedies, and then with such as
<PB N="319" REF="022373_0333_0FB86571E16C7CF0"/>
also fill the vessels. If indirect debility has been the mor∣bific power, still we must stimulate, but at first with a force of stimulus little less than that, which occasioned the disease, and then with still less; and, after changing, from time to time, the form of the stimulus, with less still; till we come down to the stimuli that are agreeable to na∣ture, those that suit the most perfect health<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">See par. CIII.</NOTE>. In that way is ebriety, in that way is every form of intemperance, to be treated. If direct debility has been the cause, the cure will be a good deal more easy: That is we must go on to stimulate more and more, till we get up to that point of excitement, to which we came down in <HI>the case of</HI> indirect debility. In this way is the first stage of phthisi∣pneumony, as well as its middle course, and also bastard peripneumony, nay, most cases of the debility affecting young people, and the disease to which the name</P>

But why do they prescribe vomiting?—They heard that from their master's desk at school, and found, that the same authority, was the reason of others for doing the same thing. Why vomiting? For the same reason, and because a relique of the doctrine of morbific matter has run through all their systems. Hence in bleeding diseases, the universal rule has been to bleed; in vomiting to give emetics, in diarrhaea to give cathartics, in imitation, forsooth of nature. The symptoms of disease have been mis∣taken for efforts of the constitution to remove the disease. It is now, however, proved that there are no such efforts.

<HEAD>Of the gout of stronger Persons.</HEAD>
<P>DCI. The gout of stronger persons is a form of asthe∣nia; in which, after a long habit of luxury and indolence, and especially, when to those hurtful powers directly debili∣tating, ones have been recently superadded, indigestion, or di∣arrhaea, or rather both conjoined, with manifest signs of a diminished perspiration, precede; then the lower extremities are affected with languor. Of the lesser joints, almost al∣ways the one or other foot is seized with an inflammation, which, if not resisted by a piece of art quite new, will prove most severe, most painful, and of a short duration, comparatively to its state in that respect in the after part of the disease.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="022373_0335_0FB86574C71BA808"/>
DCII. This disease may be called the indigestion or dyspepsia of the luxurious, that is, depending upon indirect debility; while dyspepsia may be denominated the same disease, that is the gout of persons under direct debility, as having every symptom of the gout, except the inflam∣mation<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">There are very few persons, who at one time or another in their life have not experienced painful twitches in some part or other of one of their feet, especially when they happened to be in a state more languid and sluggish than ordinary. Every which case may be considered as a gout in miniature. But when the whole phenomena, except the inflam∣mation, happen to any person, call it dyspepsia, or what you will; it is to all intents and purposes a gout. Indeed, from all that has been said through this work, general morbid state appears to be a very simple af∣fair, being nothing but an encrease or diminution of the cause of the functions or powers of life, without any other difference, but that of the mere appearance of the symptoms to our senses, an appearance by which, when we look no further for information, we are also constantly deceived.</NOTE>. For, in diseases, so little is there in names, that not only those diseases, of which we have been just now treating, but likewise asthma, hysteria, the cholic, and most of the diseases, which have taken their appella∣tions from any remarkable disturbance of the alimentary canal, are equally prevented and cured by the same me∣thod of cure precisely. Which is indeed the reason why the gout has been ranked in the number of the diseases of the same canal.</P>
<P>DCIII. A taint transmitted from parents to their offs∣pring, and celebrated under the appellation of hereditary, is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ale, or there is nothing in the fundamental part of this doctrine. The sons of the rich, who succeed to their fa∣thers estate, succeed also to his gout: Those who are exclu∣ded from the former, are also from the latter, unless they bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on by their own merit.

been proved to be every thing <HI>respecting disease;</HI> and, as it is, therefore absurd, so the truth of the latter must be ad∣mitted. The stamina, or bulk of our simple solids, are so given in our first confirmation, that some persons are distinguished by a gross, others by a slender state <HI>of the whole mass.</HI> That variety of the stamina, of the exciting powers, upon which the whole phoenomena of the life depend, be properly directed, admits each its respective state of health. suited to its respective nature, and sufficiently commodi∣ous, if the excitement suited to each, from a proper direction of the stimuli <HI>producing it,</HI> be properly applied. Though Peter's father may have been affected with the gout, it does not follow that Peter must be affected; because, by a pro∣per way of life, that is by adapting his excitement to his stamina, he may have learned to evade his father's disease.</P>

<P>Lastly, if the gout is the same disease as dyspepsy, ari∣ses from the same hurtful powers, is removed by the same remedies; and the only symptom, in which it can pos∣sibly be thought to differ, the inflammation, is only a slight part of the disease, depending upon the same original cause, and ready to yield to the same remedies; what signify di∣stinctions about either, that do not apply to both<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">If I have kept off my gout for seven years past, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter having been subjected to the most severe rage of the disease, might not I, much more easily, have prevented it before? But, it may be said perhaps, that ex∣cruciating pain makes a great difference in the scale of comparison of any two diseases: The answer to that is, that since the pain is as easily removed as the other symptoms, the difference is removed, and the weights in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> equalized.</NOTE>? No∣thing
<PB N="323" REF="022373_0337_0FB8657BEBEBE968"/>
by them further is set forth, than, that a certain tex∣ture of stamina is favourable to certain forms of diseases, which (forms) are of no consequence, in such sort, that, when the excitement is adapted to the stamina, even those forms can be prevented or cured.</P>
<P>DCIV. The hurtful powers producing the gout are, first, indirectly debilitating, not effectual all of a sudden, nor commonly before the meridian of life, that is, before the thirty-fifth year of one's age. Rich food, too much ease, have a very great effect, drink has less. To that all that have a tendency, to wear out life, to consume the ex∣citability, contribute. But the first fit scarce comes on till directly debilitating hurtful powers have been superadded to the indirect<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">My gout came on at the thirty-sixth year of my age, after five or six month's low living: It returned not again till betwixt five or six years after, because all the intermediate time I had been well supported: And this second fit was ushered in with low living, immediately previ∣ous to it, for near the same length of time, as before the coming on of the first fit. Nay, no gout ever came on but in consequence of direct debility; the indirect has not so quick an effect in that respect; at the same time it has a tendency to be hurtful, and therefore should be avoided.</NOTE>. The following are particularly hurtful, abstinence, vegetable food, the hurtful effect of which is in proportion to the imbecility of the matter that composes it. The farinaceous substances, which are by no means safe<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">A mess of porridge, a dish used in Scotland, with small beer pour∣ed upon it, and taken over night, would bring on a fit of the gout next day.</NOTE>, and less hurtful than roots, and these less so than greens<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">The juice of turnips, of cabbage, and even pease-pudding and pease-soup, which are commonly reckoned substantial dishes, have the same effect: When those substances, after being boiled, are used with a good solid meal of meat, I have always found them innocent.

water, in the height of the diathesis, given to quench thirst, immediately produces nausea, vomiting, and other distres∣sing symptoms of the stomach and of the rest of that canal, and hurries on a formal fit<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See CLXXXIV. to CXC. to CCXXXVII.</NOTE>. The mixture of an acid with pure cold water encreases the hurtful effect. Of the strong drinks; those prepared from barley by fermenta∣tion, that is, the different ales and beers, all the white wines <HI>in common use,</HI> except Madeira and Canary; and among the red wines claret, indeed all the French wines, and punch with acid, all these are remarkably hurtful. And as indo∣lence helps on with the first fit, so fatigue, especially that of walking, hurry on all future ones. Want of a suf∣ficient quantity of blood is so hurtful at all times, that, though the theory of physicians led them to the notion that the disease depended on plethora and vigour, yet no body ever thought of taking blood<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">This is one of their many contradictions between theory and the∣ory, and theory and practice.</NOTE>▪ Vomiting is bad, and indeed one of the natural symptoms of a very bad state of the disease; but purging the belly is worse<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">At any time I can bring on a fit by a single dose of Glauber's salt, unless I happen to be very strong, and quite free of all diathesis.</NOTE>.

<P>DCV. One is to be excepted, that is, excess in venery, to which, though it be a spontaneous and natural, not an artificial, evacuation, gouty persons are so addicted, and so exceed others in power, that in the very middle of a very bad fit, they are not sparing of it. That effort at first is not perceived; but in the advance of age, and after many returns of the disease, it is felt at last with a vengeance<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">At any advanced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of age, in persons who had been vigorous, an unnatural power of execution sometimes, even in actual morbid state, will take place, so as that the person will be able to outdo all his former doings in that way.

When a person is torpid from short sleep, how great is the luxury to cherish again by the heat of the bed-clothes all the parts that have been exposed to cold, that is, the whole surface of the body and thighs, but especially the legs and feet, which last, during the presence of the fit, is the seat of the inflammation; and, how delightful <HI>in that way,</HI> to make up the necessary compliment of the sleep that is wanted.</P>

By eating an exotic fruit, which had a mixture of the qualities of the water melon the orange and lime, in a quarter of an hour I had an attack in my stomach, in the middle of my lecture last summer, at the Devil Tavern. By some of the diffusible stimulus I repelled it, and went well on with my lecture. At other times I have prevented such an effect, by anticipating the remedy.

<P>DCVIII. From what has been said <HI>it must appear</HI> cer∣tain, that the gout of stronger persons is not also itself a disease of strength, or a sthenic one; and that it does not depend upon vigour of the constitution and plethora, as it has been commonly hitherto imagined; but that it is ma∣nifestly asthenic, like all the rest of the cases belonging to asthenia, and proved to be so by the strongest evidence; and that it is not to be treated by an antisthenic, as it has hitherto been the notion, but by a sthenic plan of cure; and that there is every encouragement <HI>for treating it in that point of view.</HI></P>
<P>DCIX. What had hitherto deceived physicians, <HI>and passed</HI> for a cause of the gout, was the appearance of vigour and an over proportion of blood, in most podagrics, from the bulk of simple solids in consequence of their way of life, and often from <HI>great</HI> strength. But, good men! they never recollected, that vigour and a great quantity of blood was not a property inherent in animals, but that it depen∣ded upon foreign circumstances every day and every hour<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">X. XI. XII. XIII.</NOTE>. If any one,<HI>according to that idea,</HI> who has happened to get a great bulk of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> solids, and who has had abun∣dance of proper diet, and lived in that way to the thirty∣fifth or fortieth year of his age, should all at once be depri∣ved of all the articles of diet; and if a dwarf two foot high, who has lived poorly, and is, therefore meager, and slender should equally suddenly be put upon a rich living; will
<PB N="328" REF="022373_0342_0FB8658304B12430"/>
there be the least probability, that the former will, not∣withstanding <HI>his present</HI> absolute want, continue plethoric and vigorous; and that the latter, from being now cram∣med with unusual plenty, will continue empty, as he had been before? Is the fundamental proposition of this doctrine, in which it has been demonstrated, that we are nothing of ourselves, and that we are altogether governed by foreign powers, to be forgot? Is a person liable to the gout, who has for twenty years undergone an excess of sti∣mulant operation, about the fortieth year of his age, or e∣ven afterwards, to be reckoned fuller of blood and more vi∣gorous, either than another person who has lived lower, or then himself twenty years before? Where, pray, was the necessity of comparing gouty persons with others free from <HI>all bias to</HI> that disease, and not comparing them with themselves<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Such is the effect of the powers operating upon us, that a certain degree of that operation produces an effect that would not arise under another. If the accustomary operation has been moderate, habit will render the excitement arising from it, in some measure, sufficient for the demands of the system: Hence, day-labourers are supported upon less sti∣mulus than gentlemen. Again, which is a circumstance liable to happen to the latter, if the accustomary operation has been excessive, there will be a necessity for a continuation of some degree of the excess. A podagric may be stronger than a labourer, and yet, fall into the gout. For, though compared with the other person, he is strong; compared with himself at another time, he is weak: And the reason is, that though he is still bet∣ter supported than the labourer, he is worse supported, than the usual state of his system requires. Further, the labourer, though he falls not into the gout, may, by carrying his moderation too far, fall into indiges∣tion, or some other disease, in every essential respect the same as the gout. A double inference arises here: Which is, that, though both excess and deficiency can be borne to a certain degree, so as to require a continu∣ance of them, or a gradual correction, yet they should both be avoided as entailing that sort of necessity for their continuance while their effect makes no sort of compensation, being, at best, not the best state, that of perfect health, but a state of predisposition to disease; the one to sthenic and at last indirect debility; the other to asthenic, as depending on di∣rect debility. The perfect rule for ensuring the healthy state, is to keep within the extremes of excess and defect, and thereby produce the due degree of excitement; and to apply all the exciting powers equally, each in its due proportion. The due degree may be secured by one or a few, but the equality of it over the system can only be secured by their equal application. This proposition goes to the bottom of two extensive doctrines, that of life, and that of morals; the last of which has as yet not attained to any thing like a fundamental principle. I intend to pro∣secute the idea upon some future occasion. I know a book filled with valuable ethic facts, but have not yet had time to consider, whether they all point to a general one, in which they all agree, and which reflects proof and confirmation upon them; without which it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all short of scientific exactness.</NOTE>?</P>

<HEAD>Of Hypochondriasis.</HEAD>
<P>DCXXIII. The hypochondriasis is an asthenia, in which, with the symptoms of dyspepsy, there is a noise in the bel∣ly flatulency, and uneasiness, and a rooted opinion in the patient, of the disease being always worse than it is. The way is paved to the disease by a dry set of simple solids, and that temperament, in which there is a natural slow∣ness to passion; which, however, once excited rises to the highest violence, and continues long with obstinacy. It is further distinguished by a fixed attention of mind, where∣by the patient is liable to dwell to excess upon any pursuit or study, and not to be easily diverted to another, as also by
<PB N="334" REF="022373_0348_0FB865914E1C6570"/>
a dry state of the surface of the body, a rough skin, with black hair, and black eyes, and always a dark complexion and serious aspect.</P>
<P>DCXXIV. From the definition given of it by hypo∣chondria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, it is beyond doubt an asthenia, as being ac∣companied with a noise in the belly and flatulency; and the course of the disease distinguished by slowness to pas∣sion, keenness in thinking, and that state of the simple so∣lids, which requires a high force of stimulant operation to procure, and keep up a sufficient degree of excitement.</P>
<P>DCXXV. Since the state of the simple solids is a state given by nature, and not to be changed by art, and the only indication of cure left in the physicians power, is to fit a certain degree of excitement to that given state, which is exactly the case in this disease; <HI>it follows,</HI> therefore, that the stimulus of food, drink, and others, should be employed in the cure of hypochondriasis. The patient should be kept cheerful, by <HI>being placed in</HI> agreeable com∣pany, and gay entertainments, by entering upon a journey, and amusing himself with the various scenes of nature and art through which he passes. He should ride, that in guid∣ing the horse, his mind may be more occupied. His stu∣dies and every subject of his <HI>ordinary</HI> contemplation should be often changed and varied. He should have generous wine given him to relieve the symptoms of his stomach and intestines, and to raise his animal spirits. And if these should fail of success, the diffusible stimuli, as opiates, should have their turn for a time, for the purpose of strik∣ing a stroke at once. And their use again gradually laid aside in proportion as the strength can now be supported by the more natural and accustomary stimulants. Dark∣ness and bad air should be shunned; pure light, and all lively objects, should be sought after. No hypochondriac,

<HEAD>Of Dropsy.</HEAD>
<P>DCXXVI. Dropsy is an asthenia, commonly in the form of an anasarca, with a swelling in some viscus, which, for the most part, at least in the beginning, attacks some place in preference to others, and more than any other.</P>
<P>DCXXVII. The cause of dropsy, in so far as it respects the collection of water, is easily explicable upon this doc∣trine, but altogether inexplicable upon any other. For the universal debility, that is laxity and atony, is chiefly predominant in the extreme red arteries, and the exha∣lants immediately continued from these, as well as in the commencements of the absorbent veins; and, of the same kind of vessels, it is often urgent in a particular part in preference to others.</P>
<P>DCXXVIII. As all the debilitating hurtful powers con∣cur in producing this, as well as any other asthenia; so those powers have the greatest influence in this case, that press most urgently upon the vascular system. Hence, as <HI>we see</HI> in the conversion of peripneumony into the dropsy of the chest, profuse bleeding, and a large draught of cold
<PB N="336" REF="022373_0350_0FB8659445FA74E0"/>
water, when the body is fatigued, over-heated, and burn∣ed up with thirst, are the most powerful agents in bring∣ing on this disease. The hurtful effect of the latter of which, in every case of debility, when its operation is fol∣lowed by no stimulus, has been more than sufficiently ex∣plained above<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">See par. CXVII. to CXXIV.</NOTE>. Besides, in this case, when all the ves∣sels are open, the water flowing to their most weak termi∣nations, passing out by these, and being not at all transmit∣ted from the exhalants into the absorbents, is collected in∣to every neighbouring cavity<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">LIX. LX. LXI.</NOTE>. And hence the com∣mencement of the urgent symptom in this disease.</P>
<P>DCXXIX. To this asthenia belong all the watery ef∣fusions, which do not arise from a local affection, but de∣pend on pure debility. And, therefore, if at any time a∣ny other form of asthenia, whether from wrong treatment, or other hurtful powers, in its progress terminates in this effusion; every such case should be held as a proper drop∣sy<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">See LXXXI.</NOTE>; and it should be ever present to our recollection, that there are only two general diseases, and that the dis∣tinctions hitherto received, are devoid of all solid founda∣tion. Accordingly, both from other improprieties, and particularly from bleeding, epilepsy, palsy, the gout, ter∣minate in real dropsy. Nay, the same is the termination of peripneumony itself, when it is either converted into in∣direct debility, from the debilitating plan of cure having been pushed to excess, or into direct debility, from having been left to itself, and the body not sufficiently debilitated. The affections, confined to parts, which are considered as the remote causes of dropsy, will be treated among the lo∣cal diseases, to which they belong.</P>
<P>DCXXX. After this explanation of the nature of drop∣sy, the cure of it, provided that it be a proper one, and early
<PB N="337" REF="022373_0351_0FB86598E959F000"/>
enough set about, ought by no means to be so much des∣paired of, as it should be when local affection, with a simi∣lar effusion, and the general disease are blended together without distinction, <HI>and considered as one and the the same</HI><NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Sometimes the predominant symptom rises to the degree of being above the power of the excitement, as in the tumor of schirrus, and the effusion here.</NOTE>. If long before the effusion there was no internal complaint, if the disease rather came on suddenly, and in consequence of evident hurtful powers, and yields to the first part of the curative means, there is no reason to doubt of a cure.</P>
<P>DCXXXI. Besides the general indication of cure for asthenia, that <HI>suited to this case</HI> must be particularly directed to the whole vascular system, and especially about their ter∣minations, and the commencements of the absorbent veins. The remedies are also the usual ones; that is diet, as nourishing and stimulant as possible; first in a fluid form, when the solid cannot be admitted upon account of the debility of the stomach; then, also in a solid; and toge∣ther with both, strong drink, such as the best wine that can be got, fermented spirit, sometimes pure, sometimes diluted. If the disease does not yield to these, after their use has been continued for a proper length of time; recourse must be had to the diffusible forms: By this means, when the effusion has not yet attained to that high degree that constitutes a local affection, not to be altered by any state of the excitement, this asthenia can be as easily cured as any other.</P>
<P>DCXXXII. But, when a great quantity of water has now got into some large cavity, it should immediately be removed by the catheter; when that has been done, and the emptied cavity secured with as much care as possible, and the strength supported by wine, strong drink, and any stimulus more diffusible, we must return to the manage∣ment

mentioned a little above. And if it should likewise fail now, our judgement must be, that either the general disease has degenerated into a local, or that the affection has been local from the beginning.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Epilepsy.</HEAD>
<P>DCXXXIII. Epilepsy is an asthenia; the distinguishing symptoms of which are, some heaviness of intellect, dul∣ness in the exercise of the senses; and then a very impaired state, or temporary extinction of the latter, accompanied with various convulsions over the body: Fits, consisting of such a concourse of symptoms usually return afterwards at uncertain spaces of time, and <HI>each of them</HI> terminates in a foaming at the mouth.</P>
<P>DCXXXIV. As all the debilitating hurtful agents are productive of this disease; so the loss of the blood and o∣ther fluids, excess in venery, passions, such as fear, terror, assiduous and intense thinking in great geniuses; a defi∣ciency of that kind of stimulus in stupid persons, are par∣ticularly so<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">See above par. CXXXIV. CXXXVII. CXLII. and CXXXIX.</NOTE>. These powers that produce the first fit, more easily bring on after ones: And besides them, cer∣tain unusual impressions upon the senses, some of them disagreeable, some highly agreeable; such as the flavour of some foods, the smell of a rose, have the same tendency; and certain poisons<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">See XX.</NOTE> are said to have the same effect.</P>
<P>DCXXXV. But the appearance of symptoms is a thing full of fallacy, and, unless the nature of the hurtful powers producing them, and of the remedies removing them, be throughly understood, it is incomprehensible. To solve the present difficulty about poisons, and to settle <HI>the question,</HI> whether the symptoms belong to universal, or local dis∣ease; we must consider, whether the latter one produced
<PB N="339" REF="022373_0353_0FB8659BC7262788"/>
by a vitiated state of a part, suppose that part either the stomach or brain, such a vitiated state, as in some point of the lower extremities proves the cause of the aura epi∣leptica; and whether this vitiated state resists the virtue of the remedies, that perform their cure by changing the ex∣citement; or whether all the symptoms are either relieved or removed by the change of excitement. If the former is the cause, the affection must be considered as local<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">See above CCXXIV.</NOTE>; if the latter be the truth, the disease must be held for a ge∣neral one, and a true, but a great asthenia. Nor must we forget, that a great many symptoms of general diseases, from the same origin, are dissimilar; and many from diffe∣rent, nay, opposite causes are similar; that many local symptoms have a great resemblance to those of general diseases, and that they sometimes, by a most false appear∣ance, counterfeit epilepsy, sometimes apoplexy, sometimes certain other general diseases besides.</P>
<P>DCXXXVI. For the purpose of preventing this disease, we must both avoid other debilitating powers, and those that have the greatest power in producing it. The vessels should be filled, by giving food as nourishing, and as effec∣tual in producing blood as possible; the indulgence in ve∣nery must be moderated, chearfulness and tranquillity of mind must be favoured, and agreeable train of thinking must be found, and all the objects of the senses, which give them disturbance, guarded against; the strength must be fortified by recruiting exercise, by the peruvian bark, if the approach of the fits can be perceived, and by wine and the more diffusible stimuli. A length of sleep, that is a medium betwixt too long and too short a continuance of it, should be kept up. Stimulant heat should be apppli∣ed; and all excess of it as well as cold avoided<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See CXXIV. CXXVII. CCXXVIII. CCLXXVII. CXXXVII. CXXX. CCXXXVIII. CCXXXIX. CCLX.</NOTE>. The

purest air, such as that in the fields, which is free from moisture should be sought after. The surface of the body should be excited by friction, and cleanliness, for the pur∣pose of cherishing the organs of voluntary motion, that are most closely connected with the animal power in the brain.</P>
<P>CCXXXVII. The same remedies, which radically cure the gout, also cure epilepsy, and precisely in the same manner<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">This paragraph is the answer to the question proposed in that which stands in the Elementa, answering to the same number. That paragraph therefore is erased, and this put in its place. I had heard from some of my pupils, that thay had been able by their diffusible sti∣muli, to remove epileptic fits. But in case of any mistake I would not venture to mark the fact for certain, which I have now done from my own perfect conviction. A young man lately married had the most a∣larming fit of epilepsy that ever was: His case was thought beyond re∣medy: as an extreme one, however, he got from some person the full of a tea-cup of tinctura The baica up to a blue ring a little below the brim. He got out of his fit some how or other. But was perfectly stupid and senseless for a fortnight. Upon his falling into another I was sent for, and brought him above in twenty minutes, as I am told, (for I did not wait,) so completely, that he got out of bed, and ate a hearty meal of beef stakes. Many weeks after, by mismanaging himself, and neglecting directions given him, he fell into a slighter one, and was cured in the same way.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Of Palsy.</HEAD>
<P>DCXXXVIII. Palsy is an asthenia, in which, with the other proofs of the usual debility, often with some degree of apoplectic fit, commonly all on a sudden, the motion of some part of the body, and sometimes the sense of <HI>feeling</HI> is impaired. When the fit is slight and of short continu∣ance it terminates in health; but the consequence of a higher degree and greater duration of it is death.</P>
<P>DCXXXIX. The hurtful powers, that usually pro∣duce epilepsy and apoplexy, also tend to produce palsy.
<PB N="341" REF="022373_0355_0FB8659ECCAFAE40"/>
And besides these, all the common debilitating powers that produce any asthenia, directly or indirectly; great com∣motion of the nervous system by means of to too diffusible stimuli; more affecting the circumference of the body, where the organs of voluntary motion are chiefly seated, and the internal parts and the brain less; as is evident in ebriety, gluttony, and every sort of intemperance; likewise an indolent way of life, which as commonly connected with these hurtful powers, have all the same tendency.</P>
<P>DCXL. When the disease has once taken place, as it is kept up equally by directly and indirectly debilita∣ting powers; so</P>
<P>DCXLI. For the indication of cure, which is pre∣cisely the same as in epilepsy as the energy of the cause o∣perates more immediately upon the surface of the body, consequently according to what has been said upon the sub∣ject of epilepsy, the principal remedies are those, that have the greatest power in invigorating the surface of the body: Such are friction, gestation, that degree of exercise which the strength can bear, for the purpose of rousing by their powerful operation, the languid excitement in the fibres of the muscles; likewise a proper degree of heat of pure air, and therefore, as much as possible, the open air; lastly, as none of the powers endued with stimulant virtue, by any means should be omitted, in order that the excitement, which is of great consequence in every cure, be more equal and vigorous all over; so in that extreme debility which produces such an impotency of voluntary motion, as it is of the greatest consequence to make an impression upon the principal symptom; we should, therefore, <HI>employ</HI> a great deal of an opiate, (CXXX. and CCXXX.) the in∣fluence of which, upon the surface, is the most considera∣ble <HI>of all</HI> other powers, and press the cure, till some com∣mencement of returning motion be procured; and then, without neglecting of the assistance of any of the other sti∣muli,
<PB N="342" REF="022373_0356_0FB865A195310C80"/>
but using them all in concourse or succession, for the sake of rendering their common effect more powerful and more equal, to eradicate the disease.</P>
<P>DCXLII. Debilitating and evacuant powers are to be avoided for this reason, that it is not vigour, it is not an over-proportion of blood, but a scantiness of the latter, and a deficiency of the former, that is the cause.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Apoplexy.</HEAD>
<P>DCXLIII. Apoplexy is an asthenia, resembling the two just now mentioned, in its cause and cure, differing in the appearance of the symptoms, which makes no differ∣ence in the truth<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">LXXXI. DXXIX.</NOTE>: In which, besides the symptoms in common to it with them and the other astheniae, all of a sudden, sense, intellectual energy, and the voluntary mo∣tions, are impaired, the respiration remains, but with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣ing, the pulse is weak, and the whole fit is finished with the appearance of a profound sleep<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">CLIII. CC.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DCXLIV. The heads of the patients are large and not well formed, their necks short and thick: The dis∣ease arise from both direct and indirect debility, but chiefly from the latter. Of the indirect debilitating powers, the most powerful is the luxury of food, drink, and sloth, which, after its course of stimulating and filling the vessels is run, is truly debilitating and productive of a penury of fluids: And, as each sort of debility is encreased by the other, and consequently the indirect by the direct, so that is remarkably the case in this disease. Hence the effect of the debilitating plan of cure is so pernicious in apoplexy, that it is received as a rule, that the third fit is not often, the fourth never, got the better of.</P>
<P>DCXLV. The cause of epilepsy, palsy, and apo∣plexy, is the same with that of every asthenia; affecting
<PB N="343" REF="022373_0357_0FB865A45EFEE020"/>
the head less in palsy, excepting in the beginning and end, but greatly in the two others; and in all the three produ∣cing a disturbance in the organs of voluntary motion. This disturbance, whether the motion be destroyed or dimi∣nished, in convulsion seemingly encreased, amounts to the same thing, and, as was formerly explained, depends upon debility<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">LVIII. CCXXX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DCXLVI. The same here too is the indication of cure; with that, which runs through this whole form of diseases, and the force of the remedies is especially, and as much as possible, to be directed to the parts most affected. To pre∣vent, therefore, the fits, in every respect alarming and full of danger, we ought to recollect, how far indirect debility has a share in producing this disease, and how far the di∣rect concurs with it; and also consider the operation of a greatly advanced age. All excessive stimulus, therefore, must be avoided in such a manner, that the body may be invigorated and direct debility guarded against, the stimu∣lant plan of cure should be set on foot with moderation and accuracy; and, in the place of the forms of stimuli, that have, either from long or excessive use, lost their stimulant operation, according to the rule of nature, others, which the excitability, yet not worn out with respect to them, can receive, should be substituted, that is, the kinds of food, of drink, and of diffusible stimuli, should be changed all round, and upon the failure of each lately used one, to return to those that have been long ago laid aside<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">CCCI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DCXLVII. The three diseases we are treating of, are commonly supposed to arise from a plethora, attacking the head, and proving hurtful by compression upon the brain. But, besides that, plethora has no existence in any case where it has been supposed<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">CXXXI. CXXXIV. DXLIX. DLV.</NOTE>, at that extreme age at

which those diseases happen; or sometimes in epilepsy, when it affects weak and starved children, how can the blood be in over-proportion? Can penury of food, which alone is the matter that forms blood in the latter, and in the former a vigour long gone, create an over-proportion of blood, and not, on the contrary, a penury of it?</P>
<P>DCXLVIII. As plethora has then no share in inducing those diseases, so neither is an effusion of blood or of se∣rum<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">CXXXVII. and the addition.</NOTE> upon the brain, to be accused to it. Nay, a similar effusion happens in every case of the vessels, from great de∣bility as well as in this case.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Lock-Jaw.</HEAD>
<P>DCXLIX. The lock-jaw is a less degree of tetanus, its spasm being confined to the lower jaw and the neigh∣bouring parts. This is a rare affection, without others e∣qually conspicuous; as being a formidable symptom of fe∣vers and wounds. When the former of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se happens, it will be treated of in fevers; when the latter, it will give occasion to an enquiry, whether it belongs to local or ge∣neral disease.</P>
<P>DCL. Since it never arise immediately after a wound is inflicted, but usually happens, either when the latter is healed up, or after a considerable interval of time; <HI>the inference from that</HI> is that it either arises from the vio∣lence and duration of the pain, which is always a cause of very much debility, or from that debility, which the usu∣al antisthenic plan of cure produces, or from an unknown taint in the substance of the nervous system.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Tetanus.</HEAD>
<P>DCLII. Tetanus is an asthenia, and, therefore, always affecting persons under debility, whether direct or indirect; in which, sometimes with consciousness, sometimes not, sometimes with difficulty, sometimes with freedom of res∣piration, the whole body, or the neck and its neighbour∣hood only, are bent sometimes forward, sometimes back∣ward, and held fast by a rigid spasm.</P>
<P>DCLIII. Tetanus is the offspring of cold countries, as the northern parts of Europe, but rarely; more fre∣quently of the warm southern regions of that division of the world; but most frequently of the torrid zone. The rare <HI>case,</HI> such as that among us, is the sequel of a debili∣ty scarce usual in other general diseases: On the contrary, it almost always arises from that unusual debility, which is occasioned by a lacerating wound, through which fractu∣red bones are dashed, increasing the sum of that debility that existed before, or that happened to be induced in the course of the cure. To produce the more frequent <HI>case,</HI> or that most frequent one of all, which is quite common in the torrid zone, the most powerful of the debilitating powers, and a very great many, if not all of them, con∣cur. The most powerful of these is, that degree of heat, which is intolerable, to persons engaged in exercise or la∣bour<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">CXXVII.</NOTE>, to whom almost only, and therefore to the slaves, it is hostile. Hence, even under the slightest corporeal mo∣tion,
<PB N="346" REF="022373_0360_0FB865A98AECFF40"/>
fatigue, and sweat, are produced<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">CXV. CXXXVII.</NOTE>, and from the sweat a scantiness of blood and other fluids. From a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> those arises a languor over the whole body, and, therefore, in the stomach<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">CLXXXVI. CXCIV. to CXCVIII.</NOTE>: From the languor of the stomach there is a puny appetite, and food, which is another cause of penury of the fluids, is either not taken in, or thrown up again. All these <HI>affections,</HI> as well as that indolence both in mind and body, which is inseparable from such a state of circumstances, are followed by the highest degree of de∣bility over the whole body: And, as the most noxious power, the intense heat distresses the head more than any other part, as well as the organs of voluntary motion, whe∣ther in the neighbourhood of the head, or more distant from it; that is the cause of the urgent symptom, the spasm, occupying the parts that have been mentioned.</P>
<P>DCLIV. As tetanus <HI>is</HI> occasioned by all the debilita∣ting powers, according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the different degrees <HI>in which they possess that effect,</HI> and, consequently, like every other asthenia, depends upon debility as its cause; and, as all the astheniae are removed by remedies, exciting the whole system in such a manner, as to exert the greatest influence possible upon the labouring part; the same, accordingly, is the nature of tetanus, however little that disease has been understood, the same simplicity of nature is found in it: And if there is occasion in it for the very highest reme∣dies, that circumstance shows, that the whole disease does not depend upon the spasm, <HI>and</HI> that the labouring muscles are not its whole seat, but that there is vast debility in every part, <HI>only</HI> greater in the muscles, than in any other equal part, according to the law we have mentioned<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">XLIX.</NOTE>.</P>

the lock-jaw, there is neither access to the weaker and less powerful stimuli of food, drink, and such like, which are often sufficient for the cure of diseases of lesser de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity, nor any <HI>sense in</HI> using them; we must, therefore, immedi∣ately have recourse to the most powerful and the most dif∣fusible stimuli possible, and continue their use without regard to quantity, not even that of opium itself, till the whole tumult of the disease is allayed<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">CCXCV. to CCCII.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Of Intermittent Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>DCLVI. Paroxsyms, consisting of a cold, hot, and sweat∣ing fit, are a sort of phoenomena that occur in every in∣termittent; and, in a certain proportion, in every remit∣tent fever. They often come on in consequence of a certain taint received from neighbouring morasses, or from a simi∣lar state of a neighbouring soil; <HI>but they also happen and</HI> of∣ten <HI>too,</HI> after an application of cold only<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">as in the vernal intermittents in Scotland. In the Mers, or coun∣ty of Berwick, where I laboured three months under a tertian, that is, from the beginning of March to the beginning of June, and in the Carse of Gowrie, and some other places in that country, nothing is more com∣mon than the tertian ague happening at the time at which I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffect∣ed; and nothing is more certain, than that the cold and moisture are the chief powers inducing it. It is somewhat strange, that a man born in that country, if he would patch up a system of fevers, should have over∣looked a form of them, that occurred to his eye-sight every day, and bor∣rowed his hypothetical course from a marsh miasma, supposed to be the produce of great heat and moisture, though he had only heard or read of the intermittents of warm countries.</NOTE>; at other times after that of heat only<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">In the warm countries agues often occur, when it is easy to discern heat to be an hurtful power; but when moisture is much less prevalent, for that very reason that the heat is prevalent, than at other seasons when the disease does not occur.</NOTE>, when the common asthenic hurtful powers accompany either: And they return with a

<P>DCLVII. The fever of this kind, which returns every fourth day, and is therefore called a quartan, is milder than that which receives the name of tertain, from its recurrence being on the third day, and the latter is milder than that which, from its return every day, is denominated quotidian.

DCLIX. The whole disease, as well as every paroxysm, begins with a sense of cold, the greatest desire for a warm situation,<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">I remember yet, that it was the highest luxury for me, when the cold fit came on, to be put in bed, and covered under such a load of blan∣kets (for the cold of sheets was intolerable) as would, at any other time, have oppressed me.

from this sort of argument and certainty in point of fact, we derive the most solid conviction, that there is nothing in this disease different from other astheniae, but that it per∣fectly agrees with them in the exciting hurtful powers, in the cause, and in the cure.

are distinguished by intervals of freedom from febrile state, sometimes greater, sometimes scarcely perceived in com∣mon with what happens to many other diseases, not from a∣ny peculiarity in the cause, but from a variation in its force.

Or do they differ from asthma, as well as many other diseases, in all which the same thing precisely happens? And what is more usual, in indigestion, and often violent vomiting<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">A gentleman in Scotland, came to dine with his brother, who lived with me, and my family in a house in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. He ate and drank so sparingly, that I predicted, from a knowledge I had of his manner of living, which was an excess of temperance and abstemi∣ousness to a faulty degree, that if he did not indulge a little more in these respects, he would soon fall into a disease of debility. The prediction was verified in a few days; when his brother having occasion to go to town, found him, in the intervals of a violence of vomiting, making his testament. By a good dose of the diffusible stimulus, he removed the whole disease at once, and enabled him, with the additional help of some good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound port and genuine Madeira, in a few minutes to eat heartily of beef stakes. Before his brother's arrival he had been treated in the usual evacuant, and, as they call it, the antiphlogistic way. Upon the return of his medical friends a glister was prescribed, which threw him back into his disease, from which, with the same ease and in the same short space of time, he was extricated upon his brother's return to his post. This young gentleman from that beginning, like many other of my pupils, is now a most respectable man in his profession. Some time after that, he performed the greatest cure, that ever happened since the first annals of medicine. In a very dirty ship, the Dutton, which was going to the East Indies, he stemmed, in the latitude of Rio Janeiro, a fever that was carrying off numbers every day, losing not one; as can be attested by the ship's books, for no less than five weeks—his name is Dr. Campbell.</NOTE>, ac∣companied

In fine, where is there one of all the asthenic diseases, the morbid career of which continues the same from beginning to end? There is none<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">All this confirms, and not only the point at present meant to be settled, which is that the distinctions, that physicians have made about the differences of fevers, are without all foundation, and that they are all the same with no other difference but in degree, and that, unless in that respect, they do not differ from other diseases of the same form; but it likewise adds additional weight to our fundamental proposition, that we are nothing in ourselves, but according to the powers acting on us. Ma∣ny circumstances in the course of diseases, that escape the observation both of patients and physicians, are of hourly and momentary occurrence, and sufficient, when their importance is weighed according to the prin∣ciples of this doctrine, to account for the variations in the progress of dis∣eases. We shall, by and by, see that the circumstances of heat, from the gratification of indulging in which the patient is not to he turned aside by any advice, is, with its consequences upon the whole system, sufficient to account for the gradual conversion of the cold into the hot, and the hot, into the sweating, stages.</NOTE>. For, as life in all its states<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">See par. IX.</NOTE> is always in proportion to the action of the exciting powers, upon the excitability, and both predisposition to diseases, and diseases themselves supervene in proportion to its being greater or less than the proper degree; so the course of diseases follows the same rule; and, according to
<PB N="354" REF="022373_0368_0FB865B9CAEE4378"/>
the variation of the degree of that action, is one while en∣creased, another while diminished, another while exhibits a temporary eruption; just like what happens in this sort of fevers,</P>
<P>DCLXIII. The cause of them is the common one of all astheniae, whether febrile or not; but under such di∣rection and application <HI>to the system,</HI> that, after an interval of some hours, all their morbid energy departs entirely, or in some degree. And the reason of that is, that the exciting hurtful powers in the same proportion are either removed, or more gentle in their operation; in one word, the excitement is encreased for the time. The variation of types is not owing to a matter, subject to the same va∣riation: For, if that were the case, how could the same case run through all the forms, sometimes of intermission, sometimes of remission, and at other times of nearly going on with a continued movement and the contrary? Is the matter, which is supposed to produce each form, in order to produce another form, changed into that matter, which is supposed necessary to the latter<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">The ancients supposed, that every type arose from a matter suited to produce it. Now, suppose a quotidian type to depend upon any giv∣en matter, and a tertian upon any other, different from that; when ei∣ther type is changed into the other, are we to suppose that the matter is also changed, and so forth of the rest?</NOTE>? Is the vapour, or, as they call it, the effluvium, proceeding from animals, which is supposed to produce any typhus, or continued fe∣ver, and, therefore, the AEgyptian one, when this is chan∣ged into an intermittent, or remittent nature, also, together with the change of type, changed into a marsh miasma, or defilement arising from morasses, which is supposed to produce that form <HI>of fever?</HI> Or rather does the matter, which at first produced each type <HI>still</HI> continue <HI>the same,</HI> and become the cause of another form? If any person should fix upon the latter <HI>as being the truth,</HI> how should the

same cause produce different effects? <HI>But,</HI> if he inclines to adopt the former supposition, what proof is there, that can be admitted upon any principle of reasoning, that, as often as the form of the fever changes, so often its cause, the matter, is also changed? It has been already proved, that marsh miasmata, or defilements, are not the cause<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">DCLIII. DCLIV. DCLV.</NOTE>. And it shall be by and by evinced, that the animal effluvi∣um, or vapour, arising from the body, when affected <HI>with a continued fever,</HI> is not: Nay, it has been proved by the most solid arguments, that neither is any other matter taken into the body, either in this or any case, that which produ∣ces the disease, and that the change of excitement alone is the universal source of all general diseases<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">See the paragraphs XXII. XXIII. LXII. LXIX. LXX. LXXII. LXXIII. and LXXXVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DCLXIV. To enquire into the return of fits; it is not peculiar to this form of fevers, to have a return of the general affection after its temporary solution; the same thing happens to the gout, as often as a return of the dis∣ease again succeeds to a return of health<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">DCLVI.</NOTE>, and for the same reason<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">DCLVII.</NOTE>: For, as those diseases are repelled by in∣vigorating means, so they are brought back by the debili∣tating powers, which were their first cause. Accordingly, when the disease is left to itself, when it is treated by a de∣bilitating plan of cure, it perseveres in returning; when it is treated with Peruvian bark, and still more certainly by the forms of wine and diffusible stimuli, and when that mode of cure is persisted in, till the strength is quite con∣firmed, it never returns.</P>
<P>DCLXV. The tertian vernal fevers of Scotland go off without medicines, in process of time, first in consequence of the heat of the bed, and then, as the summer sets in, by basking in the rays of the sun, and by a moderate use of food
<PB N="356" REF="022373_0370_0FB865BFD08D9450"/>
and strong drink, <HI>their duration</HI> commonly <HI>not exceeding</HI> the space of three months. In all the southern regions, and even in England, the Peruvian bark, when the whole cure is entrusted to it, often fails, and they are not removed but by very diffusible stimuli<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Dr. Wainman, as it was said before, found that to be the case in the fens of Lincolnshire. From which we may learn how little depend∣ence is to be had on the facts in medicine, as they are delivered from desks or in books; from both which we have always been taught to be∣lieve, that the Peruvian bark was a catholicon in intermittent fevers. But, if it fails in the cure of the mild state of that disease in this country, what must we think of its efficacy in the malignant intermittents and re∣mittents of the warm countries? And, if that medicine, with its univer∣sal high character, shall turn out next to an imposition, what are we to think of testimonies in favour of any thing? One of the ways of admi∣nistering the bark is in strong wine or spirit, and it can hardly be doubt∣ed, but in that compound form it may have been of service. But where shall we find a panegyrist on the bark, who will make any allowance for the powerful medicine conjoined with it? They talk of it as a vehi∣cle, without allowing it any other credit. In the same manner, at all times, have many powers of great operation been overlooked in the ac∣counts given us of remedies, and the merit of the cure imputed to the most inert. I have most generally found an analogy betwixt the reme∣dies, that are, in reality, powerful, and our ordinary supports of health. The wines and strong drinks are certainly a part of diet with most people, and so is opium among the Turks. But what analogy can be found be∣twixt the same ordinary supports of life, the same durable and natural sti∣muli, and the bark of a tree, whether brought from South America, or growing among ourselves? I will not pretend to say, that the bark is de∣void of all virtue: but I must have greater proofs of its power over dis∣ease than I have yet met with, before I can retract much of what I have said.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DCLXVI. The debility during the cold stage is the greatest, that of the hot less, and that of the sweating stage, which ends in health for the time, is the least of all. Hence, in a gentle degree of the disease, as cold is the most hurtful power, the consequence is, that its effect is gradually taken off by the agreeable heat of the bed or of the sun, and the
<PB N="357" REF="022373_0371_0FB865C2A0E3C8D8"/>
strength, thereby gradually drawn forth. The heart and arteries, gradually excited by the same heat, acquire vigour, and at last, excited in their perspiratory terminations by the same stimulus the most hurtful symptom being thereby re∣moved, they restore the hot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, and afterwards carry on the same process to the breaking out of sweat.</P>
<P>DCLXVII. When the force of the disease is greater, these powers are ineffectual; and, unless the most powerful remedies are applied, the disease, instead <HI>of producing</HI> inter∣missions, rushes head-long into the remittent state only, or even into those very obscure remissions, which give the appearance of a continued disease.</P>
<P>DCLXVIII. And, since in every case of disease of any energy, the disease returns, for this reason, that either the lesser force, by which it is kept up, is not stopt by a lesser force of remedies, or the greater force of the former by a greater force of the latter<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">For the curative force must be always accommodated to the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bific, or cause of the disease. See above XCII. CIX.</NOTE>; the remedies, therefore, should be given both before the cold fit, and during it, as also through the whole course of the intermission to the next paroxism, and they should be continued even through this, and after it is over. Lastly, like the practice in eve∣ry other cure of asthenic diseases, we should gradually re∣cede from <HI>the use of</HI> the highest stimuli, in proportion as the body can now be supported by the lesser and more na∣tural<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">CV. and CVII.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>DCLXXV. The pestilential typhus, or the jail, putrid, and petechial fever, is an asthenic disease of the highest de∣bility, scarce excepting the plague itself; in which the sur∣face of the body is first dry, pale, hot, shrivelled; then, chiefly towards the end, moist, drivelled with spots, and colliquative sweats, diversified with vibices, or long strokes like those laid on by a whip, and wasted with colliquative diarrhoea; in which the stomach is affected with the want of appetite, loathing of food, nausea, often with vomiting; in which the belly is first boundish, and then, as it has been said, subject to colliquative evacuation; in which the intellectual function is first impaired, then becomes inco∣herent, afterwards delirious, and that often in the highest degree; in which the spirits are dejected and wasted with sadness and melancholy; in which the voluntary motions are early impaired, and then so destroyed, that the patient cannot be supported in his posture in bed by his own mus∣cles, or <HI>prevented</HI> from slipping down, from time to time, from the upper to the lower part, and the senses are either blunted or preternaturally acute. In fine, the urine, the foeces, the breath, and all the excrementitious discharges, have a singular foetid smell.</P>

<PB N="360" REF="022373_0374_0FB865C686B58F50"/>
carbuncles, buboes, and anthraces, or fiery sores, are added. These are most frequent in the plague, but not so confined to it, as to be excluded from the pestilential fever<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">CCXIX.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>DCLXXVIII. With respect to the contagious matter of typhus; the corruption of the fluids is by no means to be imputed to it<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See above CXV. CXXII.

<P>DCLXXXII. And as it never happens, that either di∣rect or indirect debility alone proves hurtful, <HI>hence we have</HI> a third case given, where we have to combat <HI>both sorts of debility</HI><NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Suppose any direct debility has occasioned a disease, when that is established, the excitability is so morbidly accumulated, that the slighest exertion of any exciting power becomes too much for it; which immedi∣ately constitutes an admixture of indirect debility. The stimulus of cor∣poreal motion, which is a great and rough indirectly debilitating power, is often too long continued, after a typhus fever has begun its insidious attack upon the habit; and hence the after-part of the disease becomes more severe and dangerous. It is also to the same cause that we owe the propriety of excluding light and sound, when they prove causes of irri∣tation, their stimulus, though slight, being too strong for their accu∣mulated excitability. The guarding against gusts of passion and emotion, as well as mental exertion, is all upon the same principle. When a per∣son falls into a fever from excessive labour and low diet at the same time, that is an instance of a mixture of debility from the beginning. Again, when any disease, chiefly of indirect debility, is treated by bleeding, o∣ther evacuations and starving, that is an instance of a superinducement of direct upon indirect debility. A judicious practitioner, and who pre∣scribes according to the rules that arise from a near acquaintance with the operations of the inanimate part of matter upon living systems, will find plenty of scope for the exercise of his judgement in these and many other niceties: And he will find, that the Brunonian doctrine, as it is now nick∣named by those who know it not, is not a doctrine to be practised without knowledge, without judgement, and without sense; but that it requires e∣very part of knowledge requisite to throw light upon so extensive a subject, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat of the science of life over all nature, and all the judgement and good sense of the soundest understanding to carry it into application upon many occasions of nicety and difficulty. The trash that has hitherto too often passed for knowledge, is to be acknowledged not only useless, but hurtful. But the true knowledge of nature must be always elegant, al∣ways satisfactory, always useful. It is to be hoped the day is not far distant, when this doctrine will change its present appellation, into that of the doctrine of Nature, over the living part of her productions; com∣prehending not only the morbid but healthy phoenomena, and the dis∣tinctions between the living and the dead state.</NOTE>.</P>

His excitability has been worn out by an unusually strong stimulus, the effect of the first night's sleep is to allow it to accumulate again: In this state much exer∣cise fatigues, for want of excitement to enable it to be born: Fluid nou∣rishment is commonly used, but it is not strong enough to waste the re∣dundance of excitability, and bring the patient back to his healthy ex∣citement. The dram drinkers know the remedy, but they know not its bounds. They have recourse to a glass of strong spirit, and they would be right if they stopt at one, two, or a very few, according to the quan∣tity, that their former habit may render necessary, and take no more than what gave them an appetite for solid nourishing animal food; which, whatever the quantity that is required to produce it be, is the best general rule: But they go on, and every day till that of their death, which soon arrives, renew the disease. The rule is to take a little of what proved hurtful, till a return of appetite comes on: After eating a little, a walk or a ride will add more stimulus: The air, in which the exercise or gestation is performed, will furnish another. In that way, more strength will be acquired in proportion as a greater number or sti∣muli have wasted more excitability, and with more equality. A second day's management by applying the stimuli in a still lesser degree, will commonly remove all the complaints. When an habit of hard drink∣ing has brought on, as it always will sooner or later, a very bad and confirmed disease; if the excitability is nearly worn out, and what re∣mains is very unequal, as having been produced chiefly by an alternation betwixt one stimulus acting with partial excess and sleep, either imper∣fectly removing the excess, or by its length superadding direct to the in∣direct debility, which the drink occasions; the patient should have somewhat a lesser quantity, than that which at any time hurts him; then the next day still less; and so on, till very little will serve him, and he should add all the other stimuli in proportion as he diminishes the morbid one.</NOTE>; then recourse should be had to lesser

In a similar manner, an excitability that has been accumulated from defici∣cacy of stimuli for a number of weeks or months, will require a space of time, somewhat proportioned to that, to wear it out in the manner most suitable, to restore the lost vigour. Some health will be sooner brought about, but the effectuating of perfect health must be a work of time. A∣gain, the direct debility of a few days will be easily removed in a few days. In fevers, and every case of high debility, the accumulation of ex∣citability for want of stimulant power to produce excitement, must be estimated by the number of stimuli that have been withheld, as well as the degree of force of each of them. In a fever, then, the stimulus of exercise, of the open air, of conversation, of diversion of every kind, of an agreeable flow of spirits, of a pleasant train of thinking, of light and sound in a great measure, as well as of the exercise of all the other senses, and particularly the stimulus of a due quantity of blood, and other fluids, and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> especially that of nourishing food, and, at least upon the com∣mon plan of practice, that of wine and exhilarating drink, all these, are withheld, and, therefore, for want of them, the diminution of excite∣ment must both be great and unequal. What then is required as to the idea of the cure? Since most of those, which are the ordinary stimuli, by which the ordinary health is supported, cannot be applied; the proper idea is to look out for a power in nature, that can, as nearly as possible, supply, both the degree and equality of stimulant operation that is want∣ed. Such a power we find in the few diffusible stimuli, and particularly in opium (See par. CXXX.) Any of those act powerfully on the sto∣mach, and diffuse proportional excitement over the system. So soon and effectually do they pervade it, and act with the most powerful ef∣fect upon the surface, that it is often an object of attention in the prac∣tice to think of means to prevent it from going too far. By the blessed use of those remedies, the excitement of the stomach is restored, so that with a return of appetite, food can be taken in, and digested, in so far as the powers of that organ go; which are confined chiefly to the first part of digestion, or what is called the first concoction. Next the ex∣citement is restored in the other digestive organs, in the duodenum, in the biliary vessels, the pancreatic duct, in the lacteal vessels, through their whole course from the intestines to their common receptacle, as all the vessels that return lymph from every part of the body, in the veins be∣twixt the thoracic duct and the heart, in all the cavities of the latter, in all the red arteries, in the colourless terminations of all these, whether exhalant or glandular, and whether only simple separating, or also chan∣ging, the property of the fluid they secrate, in all the internal cavities of the body, in the commencing extremities of the absorbent vessels, and in their progress through their lymphatic trunks to the receptacle in com∣mon to them with the lacteals, which are a part of their number, in the thoracic duct again; as also from that to the heart, and from the heart to the extremities of the arteries: Lastly, the influence of excite∣ment is extended to these terminations of the arterial system, whether exhalant or glandular▪ which perform the several functions of excremen∣titious secretion and excretion, by which every portion of fluids, now be∣come useless, or, if they were retained, hurtful to the system, are thrown out by their several emunctories. When, by the use of the diffusible sti∣muli, the stomach, and all the organs can perform their respective func∣tions, the natural stimuli begin to be restored; the stomach, the intes∣tines, the lacteals and blood vessels, and all the other vessels, are gradu∣ally filled with their respective fluids; the muscles on the surface, and the muscular fibres recover their tone and density; the brain recovers its vigour; heat and air can be now restored to the surface; exercise can now add its useful stimulus; and all the functions return to their usual capability of being acted upon by the usual and ordinary exciting powers.</NOTE>, ten or twelve drops of laudanum given every quar∣ter

As I have said somewhere before, the disease, from her neglect in fulfilling directions, had very nigh returned next day; but another glass repelled it.</NOTE>.</P>

And since the use of the diffusible stimuli on∣ly succeeds, when life cannot be preserved by the usual and more congruous to nature, and a due quantity of blood and other stimuli soon become sufficient to finish the heal∣thy state; we should, on that account, even from the be∣ginning immediately give animal food, if not in a solid form in which it can neither be taken nor digested, at least in a fluid form, in that of soups; which should be alternated with all the doses of the diffusible stimulus: Then, in a gradual way, proportioned to the return of vigour, first a very little of something solid, and afterwards more and more should be thrown in, and the other stimuli, each at its pro∣per time, brought into play; till the whole cure termi∣nate in the management commonly observed in good health, where there is less occasion for medical injunc∣tions</P>

<HEAD>Of Local Diseases.</HEAD>
<P>DCXCV. LOCAL diseases<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">V. VI. VII.</NOTE> are divided, according to an order of nature, into five parts; the first of which consists of organic affections, where no disease over the whole system arises, none but in the hurt part. This is a sort of affection, that happens in parts less sensible, ac∣cording to common language, or more devoid of excitabi∣lity.</P>
<P>DCXCVI. The second part, likewise made up of or∣ganic affections, occurs in parts <HI>of the system,</HI> whether inter∣nal, or external, that are very sensible, endued with a great deal of excitability<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The excitability is here not talked of in its comparative states of abundance or deficiency, but in the degree in which any part possesses it in preference to other parts. It is used in the sense of the greater or lesser vitality of parts: Accordingly we can say, that some parts possess an exquisite sensibility, as the stomach, the brain, and intestines, and, I believe, most of the interior, soft, fleshy parts, and the shut cavities; and externally, the parts immediately under the nails; that others pos∣sess less, as the bones, ligaments, and cartilages and ligaments; and ex∣ternally, the cuticle, or scarf-skin. It is, with respect to the difference of sensibility, or excitability, or capability, to be acted upon by exciting powers, that we use the expression of more or less excitability. See above par. XLIX. and the addition, and LIII. and addition.</NOTE>; where the effect of the local affecti∣on
<PB N="371" REF="022373_0385_0FB865DAD3CA3920"/>
is propagated over the whole body, over the whole ner∣vous system, and where a very great many symptoms arise, similar to those which are peculiar to universal diseases.</P>
<P>DCXCVII. The third part of local diseases, <HI>takes place</HI> when a symptom of general disease, that at first arose from encreased or diminished excitement<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">like all the other symptoms, of which it was one,</NOTE>, arrives at that height of degree, at which, being no longer under the influence of excitement, it cannot be affected by remedies that cor∣rect the excitement.</P>
<P>DCXCVIII. The fourth part, <HI>or division</HI> of local disea∣ses, consists of those, in which a contagion, externally ap∣plied to the body, is diffused over all, without affecting the excitement<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">If it affected the excitement its effect would be general disease, which sometimes happens, as in the small-pox, measles, contagious ty∣phus, and the plague.</NOTE></P>
<P>DCXCIX. The fifth part of <HI>local diseases,</HI> arises from poisons <HI>that have been</HI> applied to the body, and flow through all the vessels in such a manner, that they are un∣derstood not immediately, nor at first, to have any tenden∣cy either to encrease or diminish the excitement, but fal∣ling upon parts some on one, some on another, hurt the texture of these in different manners; and, after occasion∣ing that <HI>local</HI> hurt, by means of it produce disturbance over the rest of the body.</P>

<HEAD>The first Part of Organic Local Diseases, where no Effect, but in the hurt Part, arises.</HEAD>
<P>DCC. WITH regard to the first part of local, organic diseases; the hurting powers, that produce them, are such as produce a solution of the continuity of a part, by wound∣ing, eroding, or poisoning; or that derange a part by con∣tusion, compression, or spraining.</P>
<P>DCCI. The hurting powers, producing solution of continuity, are all cutting, pricking, or missive, weapons: Acrid bodies and poisons produce solution of continuity in another manner.</P>
<P>DCCII. When any of these hurting powers slightly divide the surface, and scarcely, or not at all, get to the bottom of the skin; for the cure of so trifling an affection, there is occasion for nothing but shutting out the air, and cold, and excessive heat, and avoiding every irrating sub∣stance. For the only use of the cuticle is, by means of its insensibility,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See DCXCVI. and the note.</NOTE>, (it being a simple<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">not a living,</NOTE> solid, and devoid of all excitability), to keep off the air, and all excess of tem∣perature, and every rough or rude matter, which are all inimical to living solids<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">So hurtful is the air and temperature to all parts below the cuticle, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thing is a more certain cause of gangrene than their exposure, e∣ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a very short space of time: Nor is there any other way of acount∣ing for the fatal effect of slight, superficial, but extensive burning. Death has been the consequence of a burn, that extended no farther than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore-part of the thorax, or the breast, and was not of longer continuance, than the time taken to tear off the burning clothes that occasioned it.</NOTE>, whether external or internal.</P>
<P>DCCIII. When the surface, therefore, is hurt in its texture, either by being cut, or bit, or stung by venemous

<P>DCCVII. THE local organic diseases of the second division are the inflammation of the stomach<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">or gastritis.</NOTE>, and that in the intestines<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">or enteritis.</NOTE>; as also bleeding discharge, with an inflammation subsequent to it; and, in fine, an inflamma∣tion in any very sensible part, in consequence of a wound, producing commotion over the whole body.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="375" REF="022373_0389_0FB865E490BA9BA8"/>
<HEAD>Of the Inflammation in the Stomach.</HEAD>
<P>DCCVIII. The principal symptoms in gastritis are, pain in the region of the stomach, a burning heat, deep seated, encreased by every thing that is either ate or drank, or in any shape taken into the stomach; hiccup, an incli∣nation to vomiting, and the sudden throwing up what is taken in; and the pulse soon getting into a state of debi∣lity, quickness, swiftness, and hardishness.</P>
<P>DCCIX. The exciting hurtful powers, and which pro∣duce the solution of continuity <HI>in this case,</HI> are such as act by cutting, pricking or erosion. Such are the small bones of fishes, ground glass, or Cayan pepper and such like things.</P>
<P>DCCX. Inflammation is a consequence of the wound or erosion, that are the effect of the operation of those <HI>ex∣citing powers:</HI> The effect of which, in the very sensible organ of the stomach, is to diffuse the disturbance before∣mentioned<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">DCXCVI.</NOTE> over the whole system. The burning heat and pain, inseparable from every inflammation, and the anxiety<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">CLXXI. CCCXLV.</NOTE>, are the offspring of the inflammation<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">CLXXI.</NOTE>: And, of them, the anxiety is more peculiar to the stomach, the latter being its accustomary seat<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">CCCXLV.</NOTE>, and the pulse becomes such as has been related, because it is peculiar to every rude, fixed, and permanent <HI>local</HI> stimulus<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">XVII.</NOTE>; to weaken, and <HI>to be</HI> so much the <HI>more liable to that effect,</HI> the greater the excitability <HI>of the part</HI> is. Hence, in the external parts of the body, that are less endued with excitability, a pretty considerable inflammation by no means affects the pulse or the body any way generally; though even there, when a part is sensible, as in the case of a burn spread to any ex∣tent, or of a thorn having been thurst below the nails, an
<PB N="376" REF="022373_0390_0FB865E60514FAC8"/>
equal disturbance arises over the whole body<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">CCCXLIV. CCCXLV.</NOTE>, which con∣firms a former proposition, <HI>in which it is asserted,</HI> that the more abundant the excitability is<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">XXXVI.</NOTE>, the less stimulus can be born.</P>
<P>DCCXI. The disease is easily known, both from the symptoms <HI>above</HI> described, and, with not a little more cer∣tainty, from the known taking in of the hurtful powers; and, over and above, by this particular sign, that, as it has been said before, with us such marks, inflammation scarce seizes upon an internal and shut part<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">CXIII. and CLXVII. The stomach is sometimes inflamed from a schirrous tumor occupying the pylorus; and that case also is taken in by the systematic and nosological writers, as belonging to their gastritis: But the consideration of it does not belong to this head of local diseases, but to the third division of them. At the same time, both it and the pre∣sent case are local diseases, and not phlegmasiae, differing from the phlegm∣asiae, so fully treated of in the third part of this work. It, as well as en∣teritis, of which we are next to speak, have every mark of difference from the general diseases mentioned in the VIth paragraph. See also Chap. I. of the fifth Part.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DCCXII. As this is a local disease, and does not, like the general ones, depen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the encrease or diminution of excitement; consequently, the indication suited to the latter, to wit, to diminish encreased, or encrease diminished, excitement, over all, will not apply. On the contrary, un∣less a general disease happen to be combined with it, no∣thing else is to be done, but, by throwing in bland, demul∣cent liquors, to defend the tender part from the rude contact <HI>of the stomach's contents,</HI> and give the inflammation time to finish its course; and, if the physician is called soon enough, to wash off the hurtful matter with a diluent drink.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Inflammation in the Intestines,</HEAD>
<P>DCCXIII. The inflammation in the intestines is a lo∣cal affection; in which there is an acute pain in the belly,
<PB N="377" REF="022373_0391_0FB865EB533E4118"/>
and distention, and sometimes a sort of twisting of the pain around the travel, with vomiting, and an obstinate cos∣tiveness, and such a pulse as in the inflammation of the in∣testines.</P>
<P>DCCIV. The hurtful powers, exciting this disease, are precisely the same, as those that have been said to excite the inflammation of the stomach, that is:</P>
<P>DCCXV. The inflammation arises in a similar manner, as in the inflammation of the stomach, and the more rea∣dily, that the intestines are more sensible than the sto∣mach<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Baron d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from some experiments that he made, sound the intestines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> than m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t parts of the body, more than the stomach, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>. And hence also, in a similar manner, is a state of disturbance diffused over the whole body.</P>
<P>DCCXVI. The acute pain of the belly depends upon the inflammation: Its distention and the costiveness is the offspring of the detained foeces. The same is the cause of vomiting; for the peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ic motion being prevented, upon account of the obstruction, to proceed downward in its usual way, from its re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>less nature recoils in the direction up∣ward; as affecting neither direction, unless in so far as the stimulus, by the impulse of which it is regulated, either commences from above, as health requires, or from below, as happens in other diseases, and in this in particular<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">See par.

<P>DCCXIII. The cure is precisely the same as in the inflammation of the stomach.</P>

DCCXXIV. The case of the inflammation happen∣ing in his bladder, he will have a tumour and pain in the under belly.</P>
<P>DCCXXV. Bleeding discharge, followed by inflamma∣tion<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">DCCVII.</NOTE>, such as happens in the inflammation of the womb, or of any neighbouring part, and in abortion, and in the wound of any internal part, is easily distinguished by the pain of the affected part, and by the preceding accident.</P>
<P>DCCXXVI. In the inflammation of the womb, or any neighbouring part, the lower belly is affected with heat, tension, tumor, pain, and <HI>these symptoms accompanied with</HI> vomiting<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">The inflammation is frequently not in the womb, but in a neigh∣bouring portion of the intestines, or me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocolon, or in the peritoneum it∣self, as dissection has frequently shown. This is a disease, than which none has been more enquired into, and none yet less understood.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DCCXXVII. The hurtful powers, that excite the hy∣steritis, or inflammation of the womb and parts in its neigh∣bourhood, all amount to violence done to the womb. Thus using violence during the labour, hurrying the birth, often produce a solution of continuity, and wound the womb with a tearing <HI>rudeness.</HI></P>
<P>DCCXXVIII. And, since a great deal of blood is often lost in that way, and the local affection followed by debili∣ty of the whole system<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Pain and loss of blood are in one degree or another inevitable causes of debility.</NOTE>; for that reason bleeding, ac∣cording to the common practice, any mode of evacuation, are not to be practised, nor is the patient to be forbid to eat; but, in the first place, regard is to be had to the affect∣ed part, the body must be laid in an horizontal posture, she must be kept from motion, and be allowed rich soups and wine: By and by more solid animal food should be used morsel by morsel, but frequently repeated, and she should

<HEAD>Of Abortion.</HEAD>
<P>DCCXXIX. In abortion, the back, the loins, the belly, are pained, like what happens in child-labour; and there is either an unusual flow of the menses, or an extra∣ordinary discharge from the vagina.</P>
<P>DCCXXX. The hurtful powers, that force abortion, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling from a height, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pping a foot, a rash step, in∣tense walking, running, going up and down hill. This disease seldom, however, happens but to persons previously weak; and the most powerful agent in bringing it on, is some taint left since a former abortion, which encreases in proportion to the number of abortions. When the dis∣ease happens in consequence of the local hurting powers just now mentioned, in that case it is perfectly local: But wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is blended with the effect of those powers it is a case of combination of general with local affection.</P>
<P>DCCXXXI. The indication for preventing the dis∣ease is, to guard against all the hurting powers that induce the disease; to ride out, when the patient has any degree of strength; but, <HI>in case of any apprehension of danger from weak∣ness,</HI> to go in a carriage, which will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be upon guard from the third month of pregnancy till the se∣venth is passed; to invigorate the system, and keep up the patient's spirits, and intellectual amusements.</P>
<P>DCCXXXII. The indication of cure is, to keep the body in a horizontal position, with the buttocks higher than the head; to be studious to keep the patient easy in body and mind; to repair the loss of blood with soups, to secure the vessels, for the purpose of contracting their

<HEAD>Of deep seated Wounds.</HEAD>
<P>DCCXXXV. In deep seated, <HI>or gun shot,</HI> wounds, when the ball, if a ball occasioned <HI>the wound,</HI> is now extra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted, or though it still remains in <HI>the body,</HI> in a place not necessa∣ry to life; first of all the whole system is very much irrita∣ted, heated, pained chased, and distressed with restlessness and tossing, the pulse is strong, full and more frequent than in health. The cause of all those symptoms is the commotion, which, as we have said, the local stimulus, either of the ball or of the inflammation supervening upon the wound, by its constant irritation of a sensible part, gives to the whole system.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="022373_0396_0FB862A888C77790"/>
DCCXXXVI. Because, in this case asthenic diathesis is commonly supposed to arise over the whole body, upon account of the irritation from the wound; the antisthenic plan of cure is, therefore, always employed through the whole course of the disease; and the use of opium, which, <HI>in this case</HI> is conjoined with the antisthenic, or stimulant remedies, is admitted only for the purpose of acting as a se∣dative and duller or pain, is admitted: Consequently, upon account of the fear of a fever being to supervene, though often a great quantity of blood is lost by the wound; still large bleeding is practised, the belly is purged, nourishment is withheld, ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inence enjoined: The most frequent con∣sequence of which treatment is death, and never a recovery that is not owing to accident.</P>
<P>DCCXXXVII. But all this is a method of cure <HI>con∣ducted upon</HI> an erroneous theory, which is proved by all the principles of this doctrine, and by the very unfortunate issue of that practice. In a person, who has lost a great deal of blood an over-proportion of blood, can ne∣ver be the cause of sthenic diathesis: Neither can any tolerable reason be assigned for the profuse evacu∣ation of the serous fluid, or for not <HI>rather</HI> supplying new fluids by the use of food. It is in vain to accuse fre∣quency of the pulse, as a sign of an excess in the quantity of blood, and of to much vigour, or of any irritation that wants an antisthenic plan of cure: For, besides its hard∣ness, if the pulse is not, at the same time, strong and full; it has been now often above demonstrated, that all its cele∣rity depends upon debility and penury of blood<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">See par. CLXXIX. to CLXXXI,</NOTE>. Fi∣nally, as the sthenic diathesis depends upon the general sthenic hurtful powers, as the energy of pain, from local affection, and particularly inflammation, has no tendency to induce that diathesis, but <HI>the contrary one of</HI> debilitating<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">DCCX.</NOTE>; that is another reason for the supposition of the habit, either

remaining such as it was before the wound <HI>was received</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Which can hardly happen if blood has been lost, which must di∣minish the excitement, and in proportion to its degree.</NOTE> or, which is more probable, of degenerating into the asthenic diathesis. Lastly, the true explanation of the distinction betwixt irritation and sthenic diathesis is in confirmation of the same <HI>conclusion;</HI> the sthenic diathesis being that state of the system, which is produced by all the powers, the ope∣ration in common to which is stimulant, over the whole system, and, by fullness in the vessels producing the same effect, and to be removed by debilitating powers weakening also the whole system, and by evacuant remedies acting by the same general operation; whereas, on the contrary, it is ir∣ritation or that state, in which the whole body is often, with∣out any stimulus, debilitated<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">When the body is debilitated, the ordinary stimuli, that in its healthy state invigorate it, and even a much less degree of stimulus, will produce the irregular motions, which are supposed owing to irritation; not that any thing irritating is applied, but that the excessive abundance, or defect of excitability, admits not, without such effects, the degree of stimulus, which, applied to it in its healthy half-wasted state, would produce healthy vigorous motions, (See XXV. and XXVI.) The tremors that are occasioned by the turning of a door upon its hinge, the sweat occasioned by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light exertions in walking, are so many instances of that, and the irregularities of the pulse are owing to the same cause. As the weakness upon which fevers depends encreases, so also do the supposed symptoms of irritation, such as colliquative sweats, colliquative diarrhoea, subsultus tendinum, &amp;c. But they are all the effect of the general weakened state being fluttered by every slight stimuli. At other times irritating powers, in the same weakened state, do occur; such as those mentioned in the text.</NOTE>; and often a local stimulus, such as distention exciting spasm, or a concentrated acid, in∣ducing convulsion, or the pain of a wound that producing the general commotion here<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">But even in that case, the real state is debility, and the indication of cure is to remove it, as well as the irritating powers: Which, while they encrease it, are at the same time its offspring, and require stimu∣lants to enable the system to resist its effect. (DCXCIII.)</NOTE>, and effect enormous moti∣ons
<PB N="384" REF="022373_0398_0FB862AB8EB3CF28"/>
in a weakened system. But, whether the debility be without stimulus, or excited by it there is never occasion for debilitating evacuant remedies, but always for mode∣rately stimulant ones: And we have only to take are, that the sthenic diathesis be not produced by the method employed from the cure, and hereby a general disease, at least, a predisposition to general disease be su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>radd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the local, which could not fail to aggravate the latter.</P>
<P>DCCXXXVIII. As, therefore, the an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sthenic plan of cure is not to be practised, from an apprehension of a fever being about to come on, with a view to allay the distur∣bance <HI>arising</HI> from it; which has the contrary tendency, that of inducing the fever, and of exciting the disturbance <HI>apprehended;</HI> so, neither is the stimulant plan to be at∣tempted, till the wound is healed, or the disease has arrived at an advanced stage, and a great deal of debility is now induced by the continuance of the pain, least, <HI>if that me∣thod should be sooner employed,</HI> the blood should be carried with more rapidity than the case would admit of, and with an encreased momentum, into the <HI>still</HI> open terminations of the vessels: For it is understood, that neither diathesis takes place in this case, and that the only <HI>affection</HI> present is a commotion over the system, depending upon local affec∣tion; and that, consequently, there is no occasion for the remedies of either; excepting this single consideration, that, as the loss of blood, in proportion to its degree has a tendency to produce more or less of asthenic diathesis; there will, therefore, in that proportion, be occasion for some sthenic remedies.</P>
<P>DCCXXXIX. During the first days of the disease, be∣cause the patient, <HI>all at once,</HI> does not any longer engage in gestation, exercise, and the other functions both of body and mind, and of passion or emotion, according to custom, and, of course, less nourishment and recruit is now requi∣red; therefore, there should be such an abatement in his
<PB N="385" REF="022373_0399_0FB862ADE2A798E8"/>
allowance of the usual stimuli, as to accommodate what is used to the present condition of the system and the state of the wound just now described<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See last paragraph.</NOTE>. Therefore, to prevent too great an impetus in the vessels, silence should be kept around the patient, he should not speak himself, he should lie quiet and without motion, his posture should not be changed, but to avoid the disagreeable feeling of too long continuance of it, and even then it should be done as warily as possible. He should make his water lying, <HI>and</HI> in an urinal; he should rather use soups, than solid meat; his wound should be examined every day, for the sake of keep∣ing it clean; its progress should be observed; it should be dressed with fresh, soft, and bland matter; and if even at this early period, any faintishness appears, a glass of wine should not be withheld.</P>
<P>DCCXC. After some days, <HI>which may be</HI> more, or fewer, according to the strength of the patient, when now the ha∣bit is rushing into debility, upon account of the greatness or long continuance of the pain; <HI>in that case,</HI> besides the soups formerly allowed, meat as rich and delicate as possible should be given; wine should be administered sparingly at a time, but often, and upon the whole in large quantity; and then at last, recourse should be had to opium, which, in the common practice, is usually given from the beginning <HI>of the disease,</HI> and to the other diffusible stimuli; and the disease should be treated precisely in the same way as a typhus.</P>
<P>DCCXCI. When very tender external parts are viola∣ted by any rude matter, such as <HI>happens</HI> in that case, where a thorn is pushed below any of the nails, and an inflam∣mation spreads from the affected part to a considerable ex∣tent, and then, upon account of the great sensibility of the part, the whole body is drawn into consent; the injured
<PB N="386" REF="022373_0400_0FB862B3A4AB3CD0"/>
part should be fomented with warm water, and dressed with lint and soft, and bland ointment: And as long as the di∣sturbance of the system remains, the patient should be kept quiet, and free from motion, and nothing more attempted.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Suppuration.</HEAD>
<P>DCCXCIII. Suppuration, with which we begin, is for the most part a consequence of any general inflamma∣tion, whether sthenic, or asthenic, or that inflammation, which is a symptom of general diseases, or it is a conse∣quence of local inflammation, whether sthenic, or asthenic, as a symptom of local affection. In it the pulse is softer, fuller, and a little slower, than in asthenic disease when that precedes it; but a great deal slower, than in asthenic dis∣ease, if it happen to supervene upon it, and it is accom∣panied with an undulatory, and, as it were, a pulsatory, motion of the labouring part; these symptoms are com∣monly preceded by a shivering: If the affection is internal, the patient should be kept quiet, and free from motion, and be stimulated; if it be external, the affected part should, over and above, be fomented, dressed, and covered, and the pus, when ripe, let out.</P>

<P><PB N="387" REF="022373_0401_0FB862B6429CBF38"/>
DCCXLV. It follows the small-pox, arising from the contagion peculiar to that disease: In the small-pox the number of the pustules is greater or less in proportion, as more or less sthenic diathesis, occasioned by improper treat∣ment, or a neglect of the proper, has preceded<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">XXI. LXXVI. XCVI. XCVII. XCVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DCCXLVI. The indication of cure for them is, first to remove sthenic diathesis, and then, if that has passed into the asthenic, to remove it, each by its respective remedies; and to besprinkle the pustles with a strong spirit, or with laudanum, and in the former case to guard against cold, in the latter against heat, and to open the pustles and soment them.</P>

<P>DCCXLIX. These two affections <HI>the anthrax and bubo</HI> as well as carbuncle, are almost always combined with a general disease, to wit, sometimes with typhus, much of∣tener with the plague. They depend upon a contagious matter, and, in so far as they do not sufficiently yield to the general remedies, they must be treated with a very strong spirit poured upon them, and with laudanum, and opening them.</P>

<PB N="388" REF="022373_0402_0FB862B90D3DB1B8"/>
<HEAD>Of Gangrene.</HEAD>
<P>DCCL. Gangrene is an imperfect inflammation of a part, not terminating in suppuration, discoloured, scarce painful, consisting of pustules of a bad matter, and at last inducing the death of the part.</P>
<P>DCCLI. The hurtful power, that precedes gangrene, is always inflammation, often ultimately violent in a sen∣sible part, oftener languid, and occupying a part less sen∣sible, less supported by the powers of life<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The inflammation, out of which gangrene arises, is always un∣supported, and the gangrene always a state of either direct or indirect debility; the high excitement in the phlegmasiae, and the low in fevers, causing that.</NOTE>; it is some∣times a symptom of the phlegmasiae, sometimes of fevers, sometimes of local phlegmone<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">CCCXLVII. DCL. to DCXCIV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DCCLII. The method of cure, when the gangrene is seated in the alimentary canal, is to pour in spirit and lau∣danum; when the shut viscera are affected, to place some hope in the same and other stimuli, but <HI>much</HI> less. And, as the same remedies also suit gangrene, when it is exter∣nal, consequently liquid opium should be rubbed in upon the dying part, spirit should be poured upon it, the parts already dead should be cut out, the edge of the living part all round should be stimulated, and an inflammation made in it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Sphace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us.</HEAD>
<P>DCCLIII. Sphacelus is a more perfect and more ex∣tended grangrene, with an extinction of sense, motion, and heat; in which the part becomes soft, blackish, com∣pletely black, putrid, and at last thoroughly putrid to the

very bones, thoroughly cadaverous, and shifts rapidly to the neighbouring parts, and quickly extinguishes life.</P>
<P>DCCLIV. The remedies are in general the same as in gangrene, but they should be stronger, and administered in greater quantity, and with greater nicety, and in less ex∣pectation of a cure. When any limb is greatly affected, it should be immediately cut off, to prevent the sound parts from being infected.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Scrofulous Tumor and Ulcer.</HEAD>
<P>DCCLV. When a scrofulous tumor and ulcer has been of long standing, has disfigured the parotid gland and neigh∣bouring parts, and all the remedies, that have any effect in removing scrofula, have been employed; after that no more is to be done, but to keep the ailing part clean, bath it often, and defend it from the injury of the air; unless that, as local debility also takes place here, spirit and lau∣danum, applied to the part, may be of service.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Schirrous Tumor.</HEAD>
<P>DCCLVI. When the tumor, which, while it was mo∣derate, was a part or symptom of the general disease, call∣ed schirrhus, has now attained a certain bulk; if it be ex∣ternal, or situated in the exterior or convex part of the li∣ver, it should be cut off, and the system invigorated: If it be internal, nothing can be attempted, but to prevent its encrease by stimulant remedies, and in that way keep the patient as long alive as possible, and in as good health as the present circumstances will admit of.</P>
<P>DCLVII. The two heads of division that remain<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">DCXCVIII. and DCXCIX.</NOTE>, are of so obscure and abstract a nature, that if ever they
<PB N="390" REF="022373_0404_0FB862BD6BEA9978"/>
are to be attempted, they must be passed over at present. The third head<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">DCXCVII. DCCXLII. to DCCLVII.</NOTE> is here only imperfectly sketched and scarce begun: But, because it both admits of a complete execution, and when so executed, will make an important addition to the work; shall be prepared for the public pe∣rusal, as soon as I shall be happy enough to find as much leisure and scope for thinking as are requisite to rescue the subject from its present intricacy, disorder and obscurity.</P>
