<L><HI>At Athens once (our author has been told</HI>)</L>
<L><HI>The Comic Muse, irregularly bold,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With living calumny profan'd her slage,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And forg'd the frailties of the faultless sage.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Such daring ribaldry you need not fear,</HI></L>
<L><HI>We have no Socrates to libel here.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ours are the follies of an humbler flight,</HI></L>

<HEAD>SCENE I. An Apartment at Mr. Norberry's.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> William Dorrillon, <HI>followed by Mr.</HI> Norberry.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>WHY blame me?—Why blame me?—My sister had the sole management of your daughter by your own authority, from the age of six years, till within eight months of the present time, when, in conse∣quence of my sister's death, she was transferred to my pro∣tection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your sister, Mr. Norberry, was a prudent good woman—she never could instruct her in all this vice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>—Depend upon it, my dear friend, that Miss Dorrillon, your daughter, came to my house just the same heedless woman of fashion you now see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm. (impatiently.</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well—'Tis very well—But when I think on my disappointment—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing which may not be repaired, Maria, with you for a guide—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Me! She turns me into ridicule—laughs at me! This morning, as she was enumerating some of her frivolous expences, she observed me lift up my hands and sigh; on which she named <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifty other extravagances she had no occasion to mention, merely to enjoy the pang which every folly of her's sends to my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But do not charge this conduct of your daugh∣ter to the want of filial lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>—did she know you were Sir
<PB N="6" REF="032304_0006_0FF1BBBFB1698940"/>
William Dorrillon, did she know you were her father, every word you uttered, every look you glanced, would be received with gentleness and submission:—but your present rebukes from Mr. Mandred (as you are called) from a perfect stran∣ger, as she supposes, she considers as an impertinence which she has a right to resent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I had continued abroad. And yet, the hope of beholding her, and of bestowing upon her the riches I acquired, was my sole support through all the toils by which I gained them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And, considering her present course of life, your riches could not come more opportunely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She shall never have a farthing of them. Do you think I have encountered the perils of almost every cli∣mate, to squander my hard-earned fortune upon the paltry vicious pleasures in which she delights? No—I have been now in your house exactly a month—I will stay but one day longer—and then, without telling her who I am, I will leave the kingdom and her for ever—Nor shall she know that this insignificant merchant whom she despises, was her father, till he is gone, never to be recalled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are offended with some justice; but, as I have often told you, your excessive delicacy and respect for the conduct of the other sex, degenerate into rigour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True—for what I see so near perfection as wo∣man, I want to see perfect. WE, Mr. Norberry, can never be perfect; but surely women, women, might easily be made angels!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And if they were, we should soon be glad to make them into women again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(inattentive to Mr. Nor.)—She</HI> sets the example. <HI>She</HI> gives the fashion!—and now your whole house, and all your visitors, in imitation of <HI>her,</HI> treat me with levity, or with contempt.—But I'll go away to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can you desert your child in the moment she most wants your protection? That exquisite beauty just now mature—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There's my difficulty!—There's my struggle!—If she were not so like her mother, I could leave her with∣out a pang—cast her off, and think no more of her—But that shape! that face! those speaking looks! Yet, how re∣versed!—Where is the diffidence, the humility—where is the simplicity of my beloved wife? Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied in her grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="032304_0007_0FF1BBC1413710D0"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And, in all this great town, you may never see even its apparition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I rejoice, however, at the stratagem by which I have gained a knowledge of her heart: deprived of the means of searching it in her early years, had I at present come as her father, she might have deceived me with counterfeit man∣ners, till time disclosed the imposition.—Now at least, I am not imposed upon.</P>

<P>Lord Priory!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>An old acquaintance of mine, though we sel∣dom meet. He has some singularities; and yet, perhaps—</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lord</HI> Priory.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lord, I am glad to see you. Mr. Mandred (<HI>introducing Sir</HI> William). My Lord, I hope I see you in perfect health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but in very ill humour. I came to London early this morning with my family for the winter, and found my house, after going through only a slight repair, so damp, that I dare not sleep in it: and so I am now sending and going all over the town to seek for lodgings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then seek no farther, but take up your lodg∣ings here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To be plain with you, I called in hopes you would ask me; for I am so delicately scrupulous in respect to lady Priory that I could not bear the thought of taking her to an hotel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then pray return home, and bring her hither immediately, with all your luggage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am most extremely obliged to you (<HI>very fervently</HI>); for into no one house belonging to any of my ac∣quaintance would I take my wife, so soon as into yours. I have now been married eleven years, and during all that time I have made it a rule never to go on a visit▪ so as to domesti∣cate, in the house of a married man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>May I enquire the reason of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is because I am married myself; and ha∣ving always treated my wife according to the ancient mode of treating wives, I would rather she should never be an eye∣witness to the modern household management</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The ancients, I believe, were very affectionate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="032304_0008_0FF1BBC74AAC0A58"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And they had reason to be so; for their wives obeyed them. The ancients seldom gave them the li∣berty to do wrong: but modern wives do as they like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And don't you suffer lady Priory to do as she likes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, when it is what I like too. But never, never else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Does not this draw on you the character of an unkind husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That I am proud of Did you never observe, that seldom a breach of sidelity in a wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is exposed, where the unfortunate husband is not said to be "he best creature in the world? Poor man, so good-natured?—Doatingly fond of his wife!—indulged her in every thing!—How cruel in her to serve him so!" Now, if I am served <HI>so,</HI> it shall not be for my good-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope you equally disapprove of every severity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory (rapidly</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by severity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You know you used to be rather violent in your temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So I am still—apt to be hasty and passion∣ate—but that is rather of advantage to me as a husband—it causes me to be obeyed without hesitation—no liberty for contention, tears or repining. I insure conjugal sunshine; by now and then introducing a storm; while some husbands never see any thing but a cloudy sky, and all for want of a little domestic thunder to clear away the vapours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have long conceived indulgence to be the bane of female happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And so it is.—I know several women of fashion, who will visit six places of different amusement on the same night, have company at home besides, and yet, for want of something more, they'll be out of spirits; my wife never goes to a public place, has scarce ever company at home, and yet is always in spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never visits operas, or balls, or routs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How should she? She goes to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d every night exactly at ten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In the name of wonder, how have you been able to bring her to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>By making her rise every morning at five.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And so she becomes tired before night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="032304_0009_0FF1BBCA571FFF88"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Tired to death. Or, if I see her eyes completely open at bed-time, and she asks me to play one game more at picquet, the next morning I jog her elbow at half after four.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose she does not reply to the signal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then I turn the key of the door when I leave the chamber; and there I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind her when I come home in the evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And without her having seen a creature all day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is in my favour; for not having seen a single soul, she is rejoiced even to see <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And will she speak to you after such usage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If you only considered how much a wo∣man longs to speak after being kept a whole day silent, you would not ask that question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, this is the most surprising method!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. In ancient days when man∣ners were simple and pure, did not wives wait at the table of their husbands? and did not angels witness the subordination? I have taught Lady Priory to practise the same humble do∣cile obedience—to pay respect to her husband in every shape and every form—no careless inattention to <HI>me</HI>—no smiling politeness to others in preference to <HI>me</HI>—no putting <HI>me</HI> up in a corner—in all assemblies, she considers her hus∣band as the first person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am impatient to see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But don't expect a fine lady with high feathers, and the <HI>et caetera</HI> of an Eastern concubine; you will see a modest plain Englishwoman with a cap on her head▪ a handkerchief on her neck, and a gown of her own manu∣facture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My friend Norberry, what a contrast must there be between Lady Priory and the ladies in this house!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory (starting</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you ladies in this house!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be alarmed; they are both single, and can give Lady Priory no ideas concerning the marriage state.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are you sure of that? Some single wo∣men are more informed than their friends wish them to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For these ladies, notwithstanding a few (what <HI>you</HI> would call) excesses, I will answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="032304_0010_0FF1BBCD621C2998"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, I and my wife will be with you about nine in the evening; you know we go to bed at ten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But remember you bring your own servants to wait on you at five in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I shall bring but one—my old servant Oliver, who knows all my customs so well, that I never go any where without him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And is that old servant your valet still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, he is now a kind of gentleman in wait∣ing. I have had no employment for a valet since I married:—my wife, for want of dissipation, has not only time to attend upon herself, but upon me. Do you think I could suffer a clumsy man to tie on my neckcloth or comb out my hair, when the soft, delicate, and tender hands of my wife are at my command?</P>

<P>After this amiable description of a woman, how can I endure to see her, whom reason bids me detest; but whom nature still—</P>

<P>Here she comes; and her companion in folly along with her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Mary.</HI></SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Am not I!—I protest I love to part with my money; for I know with what pleasure I receive it myself, and I like to see that joy sparkle in another's eye, which has so often brightened my own. But last night ruined me—I must have money somewhere.—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s you can't assist me, I must ask Mr. Norberry for his carriage, and immediately go in search of some friend that can lend me four, or five, or six, or seven hundred pounds.

<P>Ah, Mr. Mandred, are you there? (<HI>playfully</HI> And have you undertaken to be sir George's counsel? If you have, I believe he must lose his cause.

gallery, the lamp, unfortunately, is just gone out.—I was (as unfortunately) coming along, when the whisking of a woman's gown made me give a sudden start!—I found a person was in the gallery with me, and in the dark.</P>

<P>Only one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bronzely.</SPEAKER>
<P>There might be half a dozen! I won't pre∣tend to swear to one. We'll say half a dozen, before I knew who she was. My rapidity would not let her breathe at first, and she was fairly speechless. But the moment she recovered her breath, she cry'd, "Villain! whoever you are, you will repent this;"—and I found it was the voice of a lady to whom I had just been introduced in the concert-room, one Lady Pri∣ory—It seems she was stealing to bed at the time we unhap∣pily met.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But what has this to do with your coat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bronzely.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great deal, sir—you will find a great deal.—As I perceived she did not know me, I carefully held my tongue—but she, with her prudish notions, called "Help!" and "Murder!" On which, I flew to the door, to get away before the lights could be brought—she flew after me; and, as I went out, exclaimed—<Q>Don't hope to conceal yourself: I shall know you among the whole concert-room; for I carry scissors hanging at my side, and I have cut a piece off your coat.</Q>—[<HI>Sir</HI> William <HI>looks hastily at his coat—on which</HI> Bron∣zely <HI>holds up the part cut▪</HI>]—and sure enough, so she had!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you dare—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bronzely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, my dear sir, how much less the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ault is, if perpetrated by you, than by me! This is the first of∣fence of the kind which, I dare say, you have committed this many a year; and it will be overlooked in <HI>you.</HI> But I have been suspected of two or three things of the same sort within a very short time; and I should never be forgiven.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ought you to be forgiven—it would be scandalous in me to connive—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your impertinence to me, but more your of∣fence to a woman of virtue, deserves punishment. Yet I think the punishment of death, in the way that a man of my Lord Priory's temper might inflict it, much too honourable for your deserts; so I save your life for some less creditable end.
