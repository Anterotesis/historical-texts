<BIBL>PSALM cxxiv. 2, 3, 6.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>If it had not been the Lord who was on our Side, when Men rose up against us; then they had swallowed us up quick, when their Wrath was kindled against us.</HI>—<HI>Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a Prey to their Teeth.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a business entertaining and useful, to recount the dealings and dispensations of divine providence towards a people. Such an employ has a tendency to raise our wonder and admiration, and excite our gratitude. To be insensible of and unaffected with divine dispensations, is an evidence of the baseness and wretched depravity of human nature. Mercies and afflictions oftentimes produce the most valuable pur∣poses. God draws his people with cords of a man, with bands of love, Hos. xi. 4. tho divine beneficenes having such an effect upon creatures capable of love, and susceptible of gratitude, that the prophet calls them cords of a man. Adverse and afflictive providences an∣swer various important ends and purposes. The pious Psalmist says, before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy word, Psal. cxix. 67. They are of use to alarm the secure,—to humble the proud,—to reclaim the wandering,—to heighten the worth of mer∣cies, and excite the gratitude of those for whom provi∣dence has wrought salvation.</P>
<P>Thus we find good men in all ages have, after mani∣fest signal deliverances, made their returns of thanks∣giving and praise. Israel did thus after their wonderful and miraculous deliverance from the cruel hand of the Egyptians: when they saw that great work which the Lord did upon Egypt, they feared the Lord, and be∣lieved the Lord, and his servant Moses. Then Moses and the children of Israel song a song unto the Lord, as in the 15th of Exod. This was an argument Moses often made use of to excite the obedience and gratitude
<PB N="4" REF="016509_0002_0FAFE8F0AA217A08"/>
of the people of Israel. Samuel, that he might effect the same design, gives Israel a brief retrospect of the great things God had done for their fathers, especially in their deliverance from Egypt, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and planting them in a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands. And afterwards, when they fold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the hands of their enemies, he raised up for them deliverers, whereby they were rescued out of the hand of their enemies on every side:—To sum up the matter, he tells them to fear the Lord, and to serve him in truth, with all the heart, and to consider the great things G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> had done for them, 1 Sam. xii. 6. David reminds them of former kindnesses, to awaken their gratitude and engage their obedience. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told, what work thou didst in their days, in times of old, Psal. xliv. nor is he less mind∣ful of the fresher instances of the divine goodness:—O! that men would praise the Lord, for his goodness en∣dures for ever.</P>
<P>The psalm, in which the words of our text is con∣tained, celebrates the divine goodness to the church. It is supposed to be composed by David, in the name and for the use of the church and people of Israel, as a thanksgiving for their deliverance from some imminent danger or dangers, from proud and powerful enemies. Many such they had in David's time, but which of them are here intended, is hard to determine, nor is it necessary for us to enquire.</P>
<P>The words of our text suppose the people of Israel in∣volved in some very great distresses, which were oc∣casioned by some very powerful enemy, who had threatened and attempted their ruin and overthrow, and from whose malicious designs they were not suffi∣cient to deliver themselves. Their wrath was cruel, and their fury burned with irresistible vengeance, so that they must have been swallowed up by them, had not the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, appear∣ed to vindicate their righteous cause, and save them from threatened ruin. They were sensible of their weak and defenceless condition, that their deliverance was not
<PB N="5" REF="016509_0002_0FAFE8F0AA217A08"/>
of themselves, their own arm did not save them, but the right hand and mighty arm of God;—therefore they say, had not the Lord been on their side, they had been swallowed up quick. They return a tribute of praise to him who rideth in the heavens for their help, whose excellency is in the skies; blessed be the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>The words may, without any force or strain, be ap∣plied to the state and circumstances of the people of this land. Our distresses have been great, but our deli∣verances have surpassed them. With the Psalmist, speak∣ing in the name of Israel, we may say, many times turned he his anger, and did not stir up all his wrath, Psal. 1xx viii. 38. And with Nehemiah, ix. 28, many times didst thou deliver them, because of thy mercies. For his name sake he has deferred his anger, and for his promise has he refrained for us, that he hath not cut us off, Isa. xIviii. 9. He hath done great things for his people, for which they have reason to rejoice and be glad. Our fathers trusted in thee, they trusted in thee, and were delivered.</P>
<P>That we may see wherein God has appeared for the help of the people in this land, let us take a brief view of the innumerable distresses and difficulties they have been called to encounter, out of which a wise and gra∣cious God has marvelously delivered them. They got not the land by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance▪ because thou hast a favour unto them, Isa. xliv. 3. That they have not stood by their own might, but that God has been on their side, is evident, if we consider their weakness and inability to encounter the many and great difficulties that lay in their way.</P>
<P>In the reign of James the first of England, 1602, there were a number of godly persons in the several towns and villages in Nottinghamshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire, in the north of England, who were zealous for reforma∣tion, not only testifying against human inventions and additions, in the worship of God, but carefully attending to the positive and practical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="016509_0003_0FAFE8F141774A38"/>
entered into an agreement for the support of the wor∣ship and ordinances of God, according to the primitive pattern. And finding by experience that they could not enjoy their liberties and privileges without offence, in their own country, they determined to remove them∣selves and families into the Netherlands, which they after some difficulty accomplished; and arriving in Hol∣land, they settled themselves in the city of Leyden, 1610; here, under the States, they quietly enjoyed their liber∣ties about ten years, Mr. Prince says eleven: But think∣ing Holland not the most advantageous place for them and their posterity, they, after serious delibera∣tion, determined to remove to America—Matters being prepared, they sat sail August 20, and arrived at Cape Cod the 11th day of November, 1620: After recon∣noitering the shores, they landed December 25, at a place they called, after the name of the company under whose patronage they came, Plymouth. Here they found themselves in a wild inhospitable wilderness, without friends, and surrounded with enemies, in an inclement season, without an house to shelter them, or fortress to secure them from the rage of a savage foe, or sufficient provision to relieve the returns of hunger; few in num∣ber (about an hundred) yea very few, and strangers in a land unknown. Of their small number one half died before the opening of the spring, by reason of the hard∣ships they had undergone, which produced scurveys, &amp;c. that awfully diminished their numbers; and many more, if not all, must have perished with famine, had not God provided for them the fish of the sea, and the treasures hid in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>How easy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prey may we reasonably suppose them to the numer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s tribes of savages that surrounded them, had not a good and kind providence taken care of and watched over them night and day, and restrained the wrath of their enemies! Such was the care of God for them, that they neither perished by famine, nor were destroyed by the bow or sword of the wilderness. Their necessities God supplied out of his inexhausted treasure, and their safety he guarded by the strength of his arm. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> round about them to be at peace;
<PB N="7" REF="016509_0003_0FAFE8F141774A38"/>
and several of their sachems soon desired and sought their protection. Such was the beginning of New England.</P>
<P>It was not long after that new adventurers arrived from time to time, so that in the space of a few years these four governments were considerably peopled.</P>
<P>The natives being alarmed at their rapid increase, combined to cut them off, and in several engagements they succeeded in their enterprizes, especially under Philip, the renowned Indian warrior. But under the kind smiles of heaven our feeble tribes prevented them, and dispossessed them of their territories. For many years they made inroads and depredations upon our frontiers, by burning, captivating and destroying, in a surprizing manner; the tender mother, with the infant babe, did not escape their hellish rage, malice and cruelty. But God, in his abundant goodness, was pleased to preserve his people, and protected the vine his own right hand had planted, when men rose up against it; he has prevented them from being swallowed up; he has made them to encrease and multiply, and driven out the heathen be∣fore them, so that they are become a great and mighty people. From the small beginning of scarce fifty, that remained after the great mortality that prevailed among them, their numbers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grown to about half a million, that we might set up our Ebenezer, and say, hitherto the Lord hath helped us. The Lord hath comforted Zion, even all her waste places, made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness hath been found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody, Isa. li. 3.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious, at this time, to take even a brief notice of the many signal instances of the interposi∣tions of divine providence in favour of his people in this land. There were many instances when they were on the brink of ruin, when every appearance was dark and gloomy. Even then some unforeseen deliverance and salvation was designed, and conferred upon them. Their struggles and distresses were great, but God had mercy for them, and remembered them in their low estate, and redeemed them from the hand of their enemies,
<PB N="8" REF="016509_0004_0FAFE8F204C72118"/>
Psal. lxxvi. 23, 24. In how many bloody and cruel wars were they engaged with the savages of the wilder∣ness; their land made an aceldama, a field of blood? What desolations were there made upon them? Towns laid in ashes, their inhabitants most inhumanly butchered, without distinction of age or sex.</P>
<P>And when the scene of affairs seemed to have been happily changed, and we were ready to flatter ourselves with halcyon days, days of peace and tranquility, espe∣cially on the conclusion of the last war, in 1763, Canada being subdued, and the savages brought into subjection; soon after peace was restored between the contending powers, a new storm began to gather, heaven lowered with vengeance, an unthought of enemy appeared to be rising up, both for our chastisement and profit, to humble us for manifold crying sins, and to open a way for our greater enlargement, and more free enjoyment of the natural rights of mankind.</P>
<P>Though Great-Britain had been smiled upon in a very uncommon manner, in the prosecution of the war she had been engaged in with France and Spain, and con∣cluded a peace to the enlargement of the British empire in America; and though in the contest the Americans had been much engaged, and afforded supplies, both with respect to men and money, much beyond their due proportion, the king and parliament themselves being Judges, for they freely refunded large sums in requital; yet their restless, ambitious, domineering tempers would not permit them to be easy and quiet, when it was much their interest to be so: Therefore, no sooner were they released from the calamities of a war with foreign na∣tions, than they were meditating the most unnatural and impoverishing one; that is, those measures, which it was foreseen must terminate in civil dissentions, and violent hostilities.</P>
<P>The measures adopted by the king, and his venal mi∣nisters, were such as imposing duties for the purpose of raising a revenue in America, and extending the powers of courts of admiralty beyond their antient limits, de∣priving the American subjects of trials by jury, allow∣ing the judges certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from damages that he might otherwise be liable to, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016509_0004_0FAFE8F204C72118"/>
Not content with these amazing strides, the next year an act was passed, known by the name of the stamp-act. This gave a most terrible alarm through this extensive continent, and rouzed every soul with zeal to stand forth and assert their rights. The union and firmness of the people, by the blessing of God, proved the happy means of their rescue from threatened vassalage. This ob∣noxious act was the next sessions of Parliament repealed, to the very great joy of the inhabitants of America. Though this act was cruel and unjust, yet its repeal was not because it was an unreasonable claim, but because, as its preamble says, the continuance thereof would be at∣tended with many inconveniences, and might be pro∣ductive of consequences greatly detrimental to the com∣mercial interests of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>There were several subsequent acts made, which might have reasonably alarmed the Americans; such as, that his Majesty in Parliament of right had power to bind the people of America by statute, in all cases whatso∣ever. And in the following year (1767) an act passed, enabling his Majesty to put the customs and other duties in America under the management of commis∣sioners, &amp;c. Thereupon he erected the then exten∣sive board of commissioners, for the express purpose of carrying into execution the several acts relating to the revenue and trade of America.</P>
<P>Upon the repeal of the stamp-act, the people of Ame∣rica most gratefully acknowledged the favour and kind providence of God, whose government is over all.</P>
<P>And as they had received such a token for good, they did not disquiet themselves, or others, in relation to the other unjust claims, but flattered themselves with hopes of a more extensive change of measures, and that every grievance might in due time be removed out of the way. But administration, ever restless for effecting their purposes, did, by a statute called the glass, paper, and tea act, made ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t fifteen months after the repeal of the stamp-act▪ resume their former language, and again undertook to give and grant rates and duties to be paid, in what they called the Colonies, for the express purpose of raising a revenue, to defray the charges of the administration of justice, the support
<PB N="10" REF="016509_0005_0FAFE8F2C26B4B10"/>
of civil government, and defence of the king's domi∣nions on this continent.</P>
<P>These and such like acts, made and passed, revived the apprehensions and discontents which had en∣tirely subsided, by the repeal of the stamp-act. Thus they went on to irritate the inhabitants of this continent. To fix the chains they had prepared, the ministry agreed with the East-India company to send over to America large quantities of tea, that they might have an opportunity of carrying their measures into execution.</P>
<P>Various methods were projected to avoid the blow. That which was sent to Carolina was stored, and as effectually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the company as though it had been burnt. That which was sent to New-York was re∣turned. And that which was sent to Boston, was, by reason of the Governor's refusing to give a permit for its being sent back, thrown into the sea. Whereupon the charter of the province was vacated, the town blocked up with ships of war, a standing army kept to awe the inhabitants into subjection, and all trade entirely pre∣vented; every source for support was dried up, and thousands suffering for the necessaries of life.</P>
<P>These things began to awaken the attention of all the inhabitants of this land, though comparatively lit∣tle preparation was made to repel force by force, be∣cause we were unwilling to break with a people with whom we had long been connected; and therefore were trying, by the most humble petitions and remon∣strances, to prevent the threatened vengeance. But all was vain, our cries could not be heard, or our petitions regarded, but shut out as unworthy of the least notice; rather insulted were we in our most servent supplica∣tions. While thus begging and imploring royal favour and clemency, a few provincial or county stores being collected at Concord, General Gage detached a party of about 1000 men, under the command of Colonel Smith, who in the evening preceding the 19th of April, 1775, secretly sat out with a design of taking and destroying the above mentioned stores. Coming to Lexington, they found a number of inoffensive peasants together, upon
<PB N="11" REF="016509_0005_0FAFE8F2C26B4B10"/>
whom they fired, killed and wounded 17 (8 killed and 9 wounded.) They then pushed on for Concord; by the time they could reach the destined place, the inha∣bitants in that vicinity were alarmed, collected together, and proceeded to the bridge, when the king's troops first fired upon them, which was returned with a mar∣tial bravery and intrepidity, which obliged those ve∣terans to retreat with precipitation, and though reinforced by Lord Percy with 1400 men, they were glad to find themselves once more secure in Boston, while all the way thither they were falling by their pursuers. This was the first commencement of hostilities.</P>
<P>Here let us reflect upon the goodness of God to his peo∣ple: They were attacked secretly▪ by an enemy skilled in the art of war, who had been often flushed with victory, equipped with arms, and every accoutrement of war; an army regularly officered and disciplined.—While we, on our part, were without officers, without men, arms or ammunition, in all respects unprepared for the field; yet weak and defenceless as we were, our enemy was made to flee before us. Surely we cannot ascribe it to our skill in war, or preparation for the field, but must say it was because the Lord was on our side, who has the hearts of all in his hands, and can easily intimidate them, and strike them with such a panic that they cannot face their opposers. Must not we ascribe the glory to him, who is the Lord of hosts, the God of armies, when a company of raw, undisciplined and irregular men, are able to op∣pose and put to flight an equal if not superior number of troops, under experienced officers, and who had been trained up to the use of arms? Had we been to judge of things, according to the common influence of causes and effects, we could have expected nothing short of a most terrible carnage.—And had General Gage at that season drawn out his whole force, what terrible waste and destruction might he have made, especially for a season? Seven or eight thousand regular troops, with a fine ar∣tillery, might have laid waste, to a considerable extent, a fertile pleasant land. But heaven restrained their madness, till there was time to form some more regular means to oppose them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="016509_0006_0FAFE8F382994C68"/>
Their defeated scattered legions with hasty steps return∣ed to Boston, where, with their whole army, they were shut up, and strongly fortified.</P>
<P>These acts of hostility so alarmed the country, that there was very soon an army of Provincials raised in the Massachusetts and neighbouring Colonies, with a view to prevent any further excursions of our common enemy. It is here worthy of notice, that though a considerable body of men were raised, there was no one man that had the command of the whole: Though there was a first in every Colony, there was no one that could claim a right of superintending the different divisions of the different Colonies; which greatly prevented the order and regularity of the army, and rendered them less for∣midable, and more exposed by any attack their enemy might make upon them. This disadvantage was com∣plained of, by some of their best officers, and afterwards experienced much to their disadvantage, especially in the affair of Bunker Hill.</P>
<P>Amidst every disadvantage, they conducted with as much decorum as their situation would admit of, and a spirit and bravery that their circumstances required. That they were endowed with a true martial spirit, they gave the best evidence of on the 17th of June, 1775, when near 2000 of them began an entrenchment on Bunker-Hill, which the royal army perceiving, sent out double, if not treble their numbers, to dispossess them of the ground, which brought on a most obstinate and bloody engagement; when near 1000, some say 1500, of our enemy were killed and wounded: Though, being overpowered by numbers, we retreated to Cambridge, with a loss comparatively inconsiderable (about 100 killed and died of their wounds.)</P>
<P>Perhaps the event of this engagement had been much more favourable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there been a proper officer, whose authority had been more extensive: For where there is a timidity, as is natural in a situation of danger, men will be very apt to indulge it, where they imagine there is a want of right or authority to challenge their services.</P>
<P>The difficulty referred to was happily remedied, by the appointment of Continental officers, and the arrival
<PB N="13" REF="016509_0006_0FAFE8F382994C68"/>
of the Commander in Chief of all the forces of the United States of America, his Excellency General Wash∣ington; under whose consummate wisdom our military affairs have been conducted; whose name is dear and highly venerated, and whose memory will, I trust, be ever precious in the esteem of every friend of America. This celebrated officer took the command of our troops at Cambridge on the 2d day of July, 1775.</P>
<P>Although this attempt did not succeed, as was desired and hoped, yet it answered important ends and pur∣poses; it shewed us that our help was not in ourselves, and that the providence of God was eminently concern∣ed in the preservation of this detached party, that they were not cut off by much superior numbers. It also afforded matter of conviction to our enemies that we were in earnest, and would contend even to blood, in the defence of our rights and privileges: Besides it weak∣ened and dispirited our enemies, so that they thought it best to confine themselves afterwards to their strong ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, and content themselves with throwing their shot and shells at so great a distance as gave little prospect of success. And thus the remaining part of that year was principally spent, and until the month of March fol∣lowing, when, by the best accounts we were able to collect, they were meditating an attack upon our army; being provoked thereto by our taking posses∣sion of the heights of Dorchester.</P>
<P>The day the important attempt was to have been made, God, who commands the winds and seas, sent such a terrible tempest, that the waters were impassable, and their purpose frustrated. Thus he is able to turn the counsels of the wise into foolishness, and make their de∣vices of none effect. He is glorious in holiness, fearful in praise, doing wonders. How much reason have we to admire the conduct of divine providence, in restraining the wrath and disappointing the purposes of our enemies, and more so, if we take into consideration our unpre∣paredness to oppose our enemies? We were without a re∣gular army, unskilled in arms, undisciplined, and in a measure unarmed. In this our defenceless condition, our enemies might have taken the advantage; but they
<PB N="14" REF="016509_0007_0FAFE8F442E879F0"/>
were restrained, which gave us an opportunity of col∣lecting forces, and the various necessaries for our de∣fence.—Kind providence disappointing the designs of our enemies, and finding their situation unsafe while our forces occupied the above mentioned heights, they, like men seized with a panic, hastily ship themselves, that they may escape the danger, March 18, 1776. May we not then adopt the words of the pious Psalmist, and say, had not the Lord been on our side, when men rose up against us, they had swallowed us up quick?</P>
<P>But to shew their rancour and malice upon their dis∣appointment, they left fire in a number of houses, in such a position that it might soon be communicated, and produce a most fearful desolation through every street and lane in the town: But kind providence directed the inhabitants to a timely discovery of the horrid mali∣cious plot; and thereby the most calamitous conflagra∣tion, intended and threatened that once opulent and flourishing town, was prevented.</P>
<P>Bless the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowler; the snare is broken, and we are escaped; our help is the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</P>
<P>While these things were going on, our force in the north was not idle: Ticonderoga was taken by surprize the 9th day of May. This opened a way for our forces to Canada, which for a season was improved to advan∣tage; Chamblee was soon taken, and St. John's, after a siege of six weeks, November 2, 1775. Our success soon reached Montreal, and extended to the gates of Quebec. This was an object that commanded the attention of our officers: Accordingly a regiment of men was voluntarily engaged in a rout by way of Kennebec, through the wilderness, into the heart of Canada, to co-operate with the forces that should be sent by the way of the lakes. This rout, though attended with amazing difficulty and hardship, was performed by two parts of the whole, the other returning, by reason of the scarcity of provisions. Some time after their arrival, they were joined by a party
<PB N="15" REF="016509_0007_0FAFE8F442E879F0"/>
under the command of General Montgomery, who, after summoning the city to surrender, and being re∣fused, attempted to force it, December 31st, in which hazardous enterprize he was slain, and the attempt was defeated. Thus fell that gallant officer, whose me∣mory is still venerated, and will be perpetuated in the annals of America. About 370 of our troops were made prisoners.</P>
<P>Though providence did not design <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s so great a fa∣vour as the acquisition of that important place, or the continuance of a life so good and great, yet never∣theless we have reason to acknowledge the kind∣ness of God, the wise governor of the world, in the preservation of so many of our forces, in the most criti∣cal situation, and teaching us that wisdom and strength are with God; that we might be taken off from trust∣ing in an arm of flesh, and never go forth in our own strength, but in the name and strength of him who is the God of the armies of Israel.</P>
<P>But to return, our enemy evacuating Boston, and re∣tiring to Halifax, gave us a further opportunity of re∣cruiting, and forming a more regular army; which we may ever consider as a smile of divine providence, which not only favoured us with an opportunity of doing something for recruiting and forming an army, but also for recruiting and augmenting our stores. As we had been deficient in military stores, and the im∣portation of them attended with difficulty and great risque, it was necessary that we should, if possible, do some∣thing for that purpose among ourselves. We therefore soon found we could in a good measure supply ourselves with cannon and gunpowder, far beyond the most sanguine expectations. The art of making salt-petre soon rose to great perfection; a business that had been little thought of, and less practised, and upon the bare suggestion of it, many thought it could not be accomplished.</P>
<P>If it were found that there was a deficiency in our manufactory, that deficiency we could supply from abroad, without the difficulty and risque of the whole. And besides, we made captures upon the high seas that were no small advantage.—These things we are ready

<P>If we had but a short respite from the immediate view and excursions of our enemy, it was that we might prepare for more formidable and vigorous attacks. The rod was continually held over us, and we were threaten∣ed with every distress that was in the power of Great∣Britain to inflict: Formidable fleets and armies were pre∣paring in Great-Britain, with foreign mercenaries to re∣duce this continent to obedience in all cases whatsoever.</P>
<P>Accordingly hostilities were again committed. Com∣modore Sir Peter Parker, with his fleet, in conjunction with the army under Generals Cornwallis and Clinton, made a most vigorous attack upon Sullivan's-Island, in South-Carolina, the 28th of June, 1776. While the ships drawn up against the fortress, with amazing fury and dreadful roar of cannon pour in their shot, attempting its demolition, their army three several times attempted to land, but were repulsed. Such re∣solution and bravery animated both officers and soldiers, that General Lee observed there was no need to say any thing to them, to inspire their ambition, or emulate their activity. Far from being in the least disheart∣ened by fatigue, they rushed on in one continued blaze of fire, with thick columns of smoke, for the space of twelve hours, when their enemy was glad to retire, un∣der the cover of the night, though so disabled that it was with difficulty they were able to make their retreat. Their ships were much shattered, and many of their officers and men slain and wounded; thus they con∣cluded their enterprize. Who was it that taught their hands to war, and their fingers to fight? Who that in∣spired them with that noble ardour and fixed resolu∣tion, that procured them victory? Might they not say with David, thou, O Lord, hast girded me with strength to the battle? blessed be the Lord, my strength, Psal. cxli.</P>

troops had met with, being unable to subjugate the peo∣ple he had devoted to his wrath, endeavoured to stir up all the powers of the east, to enable him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>complish his wicked designs. Fleets and armies were prepared, that their vengeance might be hurled on the devoted Americans. Their designs and preparations were not unnoticed, or disregarded. If we dreaded the effects of their wrath, we had no desponding fears of their success. We were not unapprized that it was in their power to desolate our sea-ports, and they had given us instances of this kind of savage inhumanity; let Charles∣town, Norfolk, Falmouth, &amp;c. witness.</P>
<P>By this time the people of America had felt enough of the cruelty and inhumanity of Great-Britain, and more they had reason to expect, it therefore became necessary to think of some method whereby they might secure themselves against threatened destruction, and transmit their rights and privileges to posterity. An expedient presented, which in its consequences was the most favour∣able of any that could be thought of, and promised the most lasting benefits and blessings, namely, throwing off all connection with Great-Britain; and accordingly the fourth day of July, 1776, is one of the most memorable aeras that ever took place in America. Then, to the almost universal joy of the inhabitants of this country, we were declared free and independent States. If we are indebted to any man, or any number of men, for going into this method for our help, it must be to the British king and his ministers. I presume I may say, that it was not so much as the wish or desire of scarce a man on the continent, before their distresses had driven them to meditate such an expedient: No, not until after they found that the British king was forming al∣liances, and seeking assistance from foreign powers. We were sensible, that while we were in connection with Great-Britain, it would not be in our power to procure any foreign alliance or assistance, should our distresses be ever so great; we were therefore necessitated by Britain herself, upon the principles of self preservation, to de∣clare our independency. Divine providence made use of them as the very means of this (to them) so unpleasing
<PB N="18" REF="016509_0009_0FAFE8F5C64F5758"/>
an event. Our enemies have repeatedly thrown out, that it was the object we ever aimed at, which is as far from truth as falshood itself can be. If this had been the case, why did we delay the matter so long? Why did we remonstrate and petition from time to time, in the most humble and affectionate manner, by separate Assemblies, and by Delegates in Congress, for redress of grievances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ Then we should much rather have been heard, and reverted back to the state we were in in the year 1763—But we could not be heard, but were spurned from the throne with threats and insults. After every du∣tiful method tried in vain, with long waiting, there was no other alternative by which we could entertain the least hope. Heaven seems to have pointed out our free∣dom in this way. A series of providences conspired to bring about this glorious event, and at a juncture when it seemed to be the most sit and necessary.—That it should be accomplished with such unanimity and firm∣ness among the members of Congress, and so prolifical in its consequences, is a peculiar smile of heaven, and should be acknowledged to the glory of that God whose kingdom is over all, and who disposeth the hearts of men as he pleaseth.</P>
<P>But we will proceed to take notice of our danger, and our deliverance. About the beginning of July, 1776. General Howe, with his fleet of men of war and trans∣ports, hove in sight of New-York, and soon after landed an army of more than 30,000 men. While his army was airing and recruiting their health and vigour, he pretend∣ed to set on foot an accommodation, to which Congress so far listened as to appoint a committee of their body to hear the terms to be proposed. The matter being looked into, it was found but an amusement, as there were no powers committed to him and his associates that could operate to any advantage. Thus ended the treaty, if worthy the name.—About the 20th of August his men were again shipped, fell down the Narrows, landed near Gravesend, and marched through the town of New-Utrecht, in their way to Flat-Bush, about 5 miles from the city, near which they encamped; but were much harrassed by our rifle-men. Scouting parties were sent
<PB N="19" REF="016509_0009_0FAFE8F5C64F5758"/>
from our army to the adjoining woods, but their num∣bers were insufficient. The British forces, in three di∣visions, take three different roads, and under cover of he night almost surround the whole of our parties, who, though encircled with more than treble their number, bravely fought their way through the enemy (August 27) killing great numbers of them, and carrying off many prisoners. As it was the principal of the British force that was engaged against only a division of the Ame∣rican army, who were stationed upon the west end of Long-Island, opposite to New-York, they found themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsufficient to sustain a vigorous attack, yet they were enabled to break the snare and escape, though many were slain, and numbers captivated. Their ordnance and stores they retreated with to New-York, before the enemy were apprized of their design.—Whatever gloom may be thrown over the mind by the recital of such a catastrophe, yet there will, upon a review of the matter, appear mercy in the midst of judgment. We should acknowledge it to the glory of divine goodness and mer∣cy, that the whole division was not made a sacrifice, when their enemy were so numerous, and that we were able to make so favourable a retreat.</P>
<P>The several skirmishes which preceded the more general attack served to weaken the enemy, perhaps, in proportion to any disadvantage we suffered. These out-works and fortresses were principally designed for temporary use; they delayed the progress of the enemy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> an important end in view. That which they attained in ground, they lost in time, they being retarded in their motions, and their loss of time was no doubt our advantage.</P>
<P>However, it gave the enemy the advantage of a more easy access to the city and island of New-York. This our Generals saw and provided against, by removing what∣ever was most valuable out of the way. On the 15th day of September they landed, under a heavy fire of cannon from their shipping, at or near the town of Harlem, and while they entered the city one way, our forces retreat∣ed the other. Being now on a small island, they could not get along without some contention; a smart action
<PB N="20" REF="016509_0010_0FAFE8F80647A698"/>
ensued on the 16th, when the Americans played the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and disconcerted their enemy. The motion of our enemy gave evidence that it was their intention to get beyond our army, and prevent their retreat from the island; but the caution and watchfulness of our Commander in Chief eluded their design, by moving towards the north part of the island, that he might at any time secure himself a retreat.</P>
<P>October 15th, General Mercer, with a party, made an excursion upon Staten-Island, where there was a party of the enemy; but they being apprized of our approach, fled with precipitation; a few were taken, with a number of arms, and some baggage.</P>
<P>About the same time was the great movement of the enemy up the western found, and their landing in large bodies at Frog Point: This was a movement of Gene∣ral Howe's for making a bold push, to hem in and at one blow cut off our army. It was the opinion of the intelli∣gent, that the situation of the army of the States was yet too confined, and that it was unsafe to continue as they were, or hazard the important cause, in which, if they should not succeed, the army might be lost, as a retreat would be impracticable. It was therefore con∣cluded to counteract the enemy, by a more general movement. It seems our whole force was to be collect∣ed to the northward of Kingsbridge, that we might de∣feat the enemy in their operations. This movement was calculated to prevent the enemy from ravaging the country, surrounding our army, and to lead them from the cover of their shipping. This design was so far ef∣fected, that all the road from Kingsbridge to East Ches∣ter was open to the enemy, even from New-York, ex∣cept Fort-Washington▪ a few guards, and a regiment at Kingsbridge, who were ordered, in case of distress, to retreat to Fort-Washington.</P>
<P>While these things were doing, the enemy were not idle; having collected their forces, they ranged their ships and troops along the shore as far as East-Chester.</P>
<P>On the 18th day of October they began a heavy can∣nonading. Their motions being narrowly watched, an ambuscade was laid for them, which had in a good
<PB N="21" REF="016509_0010_0FAFE8F80647A698"/>
measure its desired effect; they were put to slight, with considerable loss, and some captivated (36.) On the 23d day there was a warm engagement between a party of our army and the enemy, when they were beaten, and 13 Hessians left dead on the field. On the 27th the enemy attacked our lines at Harlem, when they were repulsed three several times successively, and went off in confusion, with considerable loss: And on the 28th the whole body of the enemy was perceived to be ad∣vancing. This gave an alarm to the army of the States, and large advance guards were kept out, towards which the enemy soon appeared advancing in solid columns, and attempted to collect upon every side. The enemy began their fire, which was very heavy, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣turned with the greatest vigour. Our numbers engag∣ed being vastly inferior, they retreated before the ene∣my, which gave them an opportunity of advancing near our lines, where, from a neighbouring hill, they play∣ed their cannon with amazing fury for a while, then ceased. Our loss was not great, nor equal to the dan∣ger we seemed to be in, and by the best accounts not equal to the loss of the enemy.</P>
<P>Might we not here say, if the Lord had not been on our side, they would have swallowed us up quick?—Praise him who rideth in the heavens for our help, whose excellency is in the skies. God is refuge for us.</P>
<P>October 3<SUP>st</SUP>, our General perceived the enemy had compleated 4 or 5 batteries upon the neighbouring hills, which overlooked the plains where our army lay, so that it could not be safe keeping that station; according∣ly the army was moved to the hills above the plains.—The enemy advanced to the plains, and were rising the hills, when they were saluted by a number of our can∣non, and soon retired.</P>
<P>General Howe here brings to mind the case of Ben∣hadad, the Syrian, who warred against Israel with ill success; his ministers, in a council of war, delivered their advice in these terms: Their Gods are the Gods of the hills, and therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.—He hearkened to their
<PB N="22" REF="016509_0011_0FAFE8FBC6E60590"/>
voice, but how to put it into execution was the question; for they being assailants, the Israelites were masters of the ground, and there was no other way of bringing them into the plains, but by beating them from the hills.—Afterwards they were placed in the plains, and there convinced, by woful experience, that Israel's God was God of the vallies as well as of the hills, Kings xx.</P>
<P>A learned prelate observes, that "in the invasion of a country, the invaded can chuse their ground; and as it is their interest to avoid coming to a decisive action, so being amidst their own native stores and provisions, they have it in their power: On the the contrary, the inva∣der must attack his foes where he finds them posted▪ for by reason of the scantiness and uncertainty of supplies in an enemy's country, he has not for the most part time to draw them, by military stratagems, from their advantages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Warburton's Divine Legation.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>From these observations we may be led to see that General Washington, in his several movements, discover∣ed the most consummate generalship.</P>
<P>General Howe being hitherto disappointed, turned his attention to Fort Washington, and on the 16th day of November attac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed our lines at Harlem, with a much superior force to that of the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rison. Our men fought to their honor, but being overpowered by numbers, they were obliged to retreat to the fort.—Soon after, they were summoned to surrender, and finding themselves unable to defend it, they submitted, and were made prisoners of war, to the number of about 2000. This seemed to be the greatest misfortune which had attend∣ed that campaign.</P>
<P>Here we may reflect and say, shall we receive good at the hand of God, and not evil? Job. ii. 10. A wise and gracious God may correct his people, when he does not cast them off.</P>
<P>The next object our enemy seemed to have in view was Fort Lee, upon the opposite shore. Their motions being carefully watched, their design was manifest; accordingly a considerable party of our army were led over to support General Greene, who commanded at that fort.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="016509_0011_0FAFE8FBC6E60590"/>
The enemy on the 20th day of November passed the river, and landed 7 or 8 miles above the fort, which General Greene gaining knowledge of, he determined to leave it, being unequal to the support of it. Remov∣ing whatever was in his power, he retreated to Hackin∣sack, where he met Generals Washington and Putnam, with the forces intended for his support. Their united strength consisted of about 6000<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> perhaps not half equal to the enemy. They retreated to Newark, the enemy pursuing them.—They continued to retreat in the greatest order, carrying their whole baggage and stores with them, as Israel of old before the Egyptians, near a hundred miles, calling upon the militia in every place to join them; they were pursued till they passed the Delaware, where they had the advantage of putting a check upon the enemy's pursuit, by destroying or putting out of the way every boat and vessel far and near. They encamped within about half a mile of the banks of the river. The enemy, unable to prosecute their purposes, as by experience they were taught when attempting to pass the river, were repulsed by our artillery.—The enemy were now at Trenton, and places adjacent, wait∣ing a favourable opportunity for passing the river, de∣feating our army, and perhaps reaching Philadelphia.—But how mortifying the disappointment!—On the morning of the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of December, General Washington surprized them, obtained a compleat victory over part of their army, and made prisoners 919, besides killing and wounding a number, and taking a great variety of arms, baggage, &amp;c. too many to be here enumerated. This gave an effectual check to the enemy, and put a stop to their career.</P>
<P>General Washington having defeated the enemy, re∣tired with his booty, and the laurels of victory, to camp, where he gave himself and his army time to recruit after the fatigues of his enterprize. Soon after he again repassed the Delaware to the south side of Trenton Creek, from whence he detached two brigades towards Prince∣ton; about three miles distant they met the enemy in full march for our army, before whom they retreat∣ed to our main body, though in repassing a bridge they
<PB N="24" REF="016509_0012_0FAFE8F68472AFE8"/>
suffered the loss of about too killed and wounded: But by the exertions of General Mifflin, from an advan∣tageous eminence, with his artillery, supported by the mi∣litia of the city of Philadelphia, they were obliged to retreat with considerable loss. The enemy's principal attention seemed to be to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ossess our army of their ground; but General Washington, to disappoint them in their views, gave secret orders for all their fires to be made, as though their intention was to dress their food, when no sooner than this appearance was made, he with his main body, silently and undiscovered, marched in the dead of the night preceding the 3d of January, for Princeton, where the next day he surprized a party of the enemy, about three miles east of the town, killed and made prisoners 500; with a large quantity of baggage, and six field pieces. This manoeuvre drew the attention of the enemy back to give succour to their party, but it was too late; where upon the enemy re∣tired into winter quarters at Brunswick.</P>
<P>Here we may reflect and say, behold the infinite wis∣dom and goodness of God, who is wise in all his ways, and holy in all his works! He knows the fittest seasons for the display of his goodness and mercy.—He humbles and brings his people low, that he may exalt them in his own time; and when their distresses are the greatest, his mercy in their deliverance will be the more sensibly relished, and gratefully acknowledged.</P>
<P>To view the hero of America out off from the main body of his army, driven before his enemy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a horrid banditti spreading desolation and misery through every place which they passed, was a scene distressing beyond description; the aged and infirm insulted, the innocent virgin ravished▪ the defenceless plundered, and the pa∣triotic friends of freedom and liberty compelled to bow to the image, the standard of tyranny. Now, amidst all this gloom and disappointment, that he should be emboldened by adversity, and out of weakness made strong, and at a season the most favourable be inspired to improve it to the best advantage, for his own honor, and the glory of the American arms, is worthy of very special notice. And while we pay our most

grateful acknowledgments to the instrument or instru∣ments of our safety and deliverance at any time, we should not forget the great efficient cause of all events. God's providence superintends all human affairs: But because he work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the instrumentality of second causes, we lose sight of him, and ascribe that to the instrument, that belongs solely to the efficient.</P>

This is the sentiment of the Psalmist amidst royalty, when he says, seemingly for∣getting the instrument or second cause, it is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

<P>Should we now turn our thoughts and meditations to the northward, we are presented with little that tends to administer consolation and comfort. For want of sup∣plies of men and stores, General Arnold was obliged to leave Quebec (May the 7th.)—At the Cedars we were defeated, with the loss of 500 men (May 20.) General Thompson also, near Sorelle (June 8) with the loss of about 200.—General Arnold defeated on the Lake, with the loss of about 100 men (October 11.)</P>
<P>These and like instances serve to shew us, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong; that it is not in man that walks to direct his sters, that there is not any evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it; and that pride might be hid from man, and the Lord alone exalted.</P>
<P>During the winter, while General Howe lay at Bruns∣wick, and the army of the United States not far from
<PB N="26" REF="016509_0013_0FAFE8FC83FCA910"/>
him, to prevent as much as possible the enemy's excur∣sions, sundry skirmishes took place, but no advantages were lost on our part, so that we had reason to say, the Lord was on our side, and blessed be his name.</P>
<P>About the 20th of June the royal army, like men afraid, and filled with terror, secretly decamped and stole away towards Amboy, ship, and return to New-York.—Some time after they re-ship, and put out to sea, and for some time are not heard of, nor was their design known till they were discovered in Chesapeak Bay; soon after they land at Elk-Creek, aiming to reach Philadelphia. To attain this they must pass the Brandywine, which they might do at two or three fords; at these passages the army of the States determined to dispute their pas∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g. To do this to advantage, they laboured under this difficulty; their army must be in several divisions, while the enemy might keep themselves together. As it could not be determined which of the fords the enemy would take, we could not strengthen one more than another, lest we should miss the object we aimed at. By this means their whole force was levelled against but a part of ours, when being overborne by numbers, they were obliged to give way to their enemy. The loss on our side was not considerable, perhaps not more if equal to the enemy's: Nor did General Howe esteem it any great or important atchievement; if he had, he would not have missed of making another attempt the next day. This happened September 11.</P>
<P>General Howe's next manoeuvre seemed to be to get and keep the army of the States hemmed in, that they might not be able to obtain supplies, and be reduced to obedience: But his plans were not beyond the ken of our officers, nor was it attended with difficulty to evade them.</P>
<P>General Howe is permitted to enter and possess the city of Philadelphia, with his army, and to occupy German∣town.

effects, and a sine train of artillery, to which the enemy afterwards returned, and took possession of.</P>
<P>These events are worthy of our notice and attentive regard. They shew us that our trust is not in an arm of flesh, that human skill and wisdom, nor the greatest martial powers cannot secure us sucoess and that the blessing of the God of armies can secure us against disappointment; that disappointment is not our ruin, but the delay of mercy; that delays weaken and debi∣litate our enemies, and render them less capable of ac∣complishing their wicked purposes and designs. We may not, we cannot say, God has forsaken us, while he restrains the rage of our foes, and confines them within the narrow compass of a city and its suburbs; but we may say, his time is the best, and with patience wait in the vigorous use of every means in our power for that salvation he is giving us the agreeable prospect of. Though for the present dark clouds interpose, and hide from our sight the wished for day, yet a durable trust in the righteousness of our cause, and the power and mer∣cy of the God of armies, encourages our hope; though cast down, we are not forsaken.</P>
<P>Doth not there seem to be mercy in reserve, when none of the attempts of the enemy answer the end and design for which they were sent, but only to weaken and impoverish them? With what great expence of men and money did they gain a passage to the city of Philadelphia?—Red. Bank and Mud-Island cost them infinitely more in blood and treasure, than the tempo∣rary advantages they could reap by them. Though the ground to us was lost, and the possession of them, while they were in the city, of small importance, the acqui∣sition to them was of little avail; by no means a com∣pensation equal to the expence. These things, instead of being against us, were in our favour▪ Let us then bless God, that he makes the purposes and designs of our enemies, which they mean for their advantage, subser∣vient to the establishment of the liberty and happiness of the United States.</P>
<P>The king, ministry and parliament, being determin∣ed to reduce this country, and bring it to obey their
<PB N="28" REF="016509_0014_0FAFE8FEC1530CE0"/>
commands in all things whatsoever, employed by land and sea 60,000 men; and when General Howe was sent to New-York with a formidable army, as has been taken notice of, and the enemy's excursions as far as Philadelphia examined, General Burgoyne was sent to be employed for the same purpose, with about 10,000 men under his command, by the way of St. Lawrence's river. He arrived at Quebec May 6, 1776. This army, with a very strong fleet, arrived at Crown-Point about the beginning of July, 1777. Soon after their arrival, parties were sent out to reconnoitre the situation of our forts and army at Ticonderoga. Our forts there were said to be in the best condition; our army consisted of about 3 or 4000 men, said to be in high spirits. The Commander in Chief, General St. Clair, gaining intelli∣gence of the strength of the enemy, called a council of war, when it was judged that they should not be able to hold the fort, with the lines; accordingly orders were immediately given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its evacuation, and as in∣stantly obeyed. Their whole works were abandoned; and most of their stores left for the enemy, who soon took possession of them, and pursued the garrison with the greatest vigour and spirit. Our garrison retreat to Fort-Ann, then to Fort-Edward, and from thence to Sa∣ratoga and Still water. The tidings of this unexpected retreat of our forces struck every face with paleness, and every heart with trembling. Thousands of curses, imprecations and hasty censures, were thrown out against the officer who commanded in that department. What fearful consequences were meditated? With old Jacob we were ready to say, these things are against us. But alas, how little do we know how short and con∣tracted are our views? We can see only one link in the chain of providence, and as we see, we censure; where as, were we able to take a view of the whole, we should see reason for different sentiments, and ground for saving our censures. Things viewed in their separate several parts, will appear very different than when they are viewed collectively and together. Such a providential dispensation we often say is not best, or any thing that befalls us, when we do not look so far as to consider it
<PB N="29" REF="016509_0014_0FAFE8FEC1530CE0"/>
as such, it cannot be for the best. We say so, because perhaps we think so; and we think so only because we view the matter separately. Such were our sentiments relative to the evacuation of our fortresses on the Lake; but when we have been led to see a little further, we have changed our sentiments, and have been convinced that those things we thought were against us, were all for our advantage. The effect and consequence have made it manifest.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne, slushed with a train of successes, until he had got as far as Fort Edward, was ready to flatter himself that all would come in and bow to his standard. With this view he published his manifesto, promising royal protection, &amp;c. He had previously sent out a party by the way of Oswego, to attack Fort Schuy∣ler, near the Oneida Lake, and reduce to subjection the county of Tryon; but here he was sadly disappointed. His party was defeated, many killed and made prisoners, in all 300, chiefly Indians, when the brave General Har∣kemer lost his life. This was on August 6. The British General having gained the knowledge of some stores at Bennington, in the State of Vermont, detached Col. Baum with about 2000 men, to reduce the country to sub∣jection, and procure provisions, &amp;c. This party arriving within about 5 miles of Bennington, was attacked by General Stark, August 16, and entirely defeated, 680 being made prisoners, besides the wounded and slain, and the loss of their artillery and baggage.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne proceeds on his way for Albany; but soon does the gallant General Gates appear to take the command of the army, composed of militia, with some Continental troops, who by his prudence and vigi∣lance stops him in his career, and cuts off the British General's retreat; and after two or three successful actions,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There were two warm and vigorous engagements between the armies, the one on the 19th day of September when victory hung in suspence▪ and both were obliged by the approach of night to retire; the second was on the 7th of October, when our army forced the lines, and vanquished their enemy.</NOTE> he is reduced to the necessity of resigning him∣self

and his whole army prisoners of war. His remaining number, after having many killed and taken prisoners, was 5752, October 16.</P>
<P>Thus we see a train of happy events take place, in con∣sequence of the evacuation of Ticonderoga and its de∣pendencies. We feared and trembled when we saw and heard of the triumphs of our enemy; but how soon was that saying verified, the triumphing of the wicked is short?—We may here adopt the words of our text, and say, if the Lord had not been on our side when men rose up against us, they had swallowed us up quick.—Blessed be the Lord. Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy ways, thou king of saints; who shall not fear thee! Let us sing of the mercies of the Lord forever, and with our mouths make known his faithfulness to all generations, Psal. lxxxix.</P>
<P>I. And as in the 18th psalm, I have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them, neither did I turn again till they were consumed. I have wounded them that they were not able to rise; they are fallen under my feet. For thou had girded me with strength unto battle; thou hast subdued those that rose up against me. Thou hast also given me the neck of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. O clap your hands all ye people, shout to God with the voice of triumph; for the Lord most high is terrible, he is a great King over all the earth; he subdueth the people under us:—Sing praises to God, sing praises: Sing praises unto our King, sing praises. See also Ezek. xxxix. 1—5.</P>
<P>We left General Howe in the city of Philadelphia, where he peaceably spent the winter, when nothing of any great importance took place, either on one side or the other. But a most important event took place about the beginning of this year, on the 6th of February, when by the indefatigable services of the Plenipoten∣tiaries of the United States of America, Messieurs Franklin and Dean, a treaty of alliance and commerce was acceded to by the King of France, and in conse∣quence thereof an Ambassador was sent to attend the Congress of these United States. Thus we have seen
<PB N="31" REF="016509_0015_0FAFE8FF820F2D08"/>
that God, whose kingdom is over all, and in whose hand are the hearts of the kings of the earth, which he can turn as the rivers of water, hath disposed one of the most powerful monarchs in Europe to own and espouse the cause of his injured people in this country. And while we see these things actually accomplished, the king's representative at our court, his ships on our coasts for our defence and protection, I say, while these things are to the view of every one indisputable, we have good reason to hope and expect that other European powers will follow the laudable example, and which to all appearance is at the very door. The conduct of France relative to America is a tremendous blow to Great-Britain, and has brought on such a contention as will not be easily removed. By this means the British monarch may find other service for his ships and armies, than to burn, destroy and butcher his unoffending well-wishers in America. Such I trust we may be stiled, though we have been inhumanly and savagely treated; yet as we make a profession of christianity, benevolence must mark our character.</P>
<P>The wise and righteous Governor of the world is cutting out other work for Britain than that she has been employing herself about these three years past. It has been a matter of speculation with some, that the Americans should be fond of forming an alliance with France, on account of her religious sentiments, being in general Roman Catholics; and doubtless every one that is an enemy to this alliance will make this the ground of their objections, even though they were Catholics themselves, or equally superstitious, and not a whit better.</P>
<P>Upon which I would observe, that such an alliance is not unexampled; England has been in alliance with Portugal, the inhabitants of which are almost if not wholly Roman Catholics; and France with Holland, yet the Hollanders are chiefly Presbyterians. The king of England has been in alliance with the king of Prussia, where Lutheranism chiefly prevails. And it is not long since we were threatened with an alliance and assistance which Great-Britain fought after with Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
<PB N="32" REF="016509_0016_0FAFE900412559A8"/>
In that case their different sentiments in religious mat∣ters were no bar in the way. Differences in religion have no operation in the political system, and commer∣cial interest of nations and people; but yet advantage may arise by such an alliance, in a moral or religious view, though not by design and immediately, yet in its operation and influence it may have this happy ef∣fect. The Protestants in France are not an inconsider∣able part of the nation, who have always been kept un∣der and much out of sight, ever since the repeal of the edict of Nantz. Now this alliance may have a good ten∣dency to cure the nation of their bigotry, root out their sanguinary notions, and introduce an universal toleration. They have already granted a toleration for traders and factors, or any that shall settle among them from Ame∣rica. This beginning may have a happy and glorious end; and if it should terminate as there is some ground to hope it may, the now unhappy Protestants of that country would feel the most grateful sense of divine kindness, and bless God that such an alliance had been formed. These things duly considered are sufficient to remove those difficulties that have perplexed the minds of some, who may have thought such a thing unprecedented.—May it not be considered as a smile of divine providence, and one of the methods that God is taking for our help and deliverance from present trouble?</P>
<P>Perhaps this may have been one reason that the Bri∣tish troops evacuated the city of Philadelphia (June 18) that their force might be more united, and that they might be able to secure New-York, in case any attempt should, by the assistance of France, be made against it. But be that as it may, let the reasons remain with themselves. It was enough for us to know they had evacuated the city, and that we might prevent as much of their mischief as possible, our army were soon in pur∣suit of them. They were overtaken at Monmouth, the 28th day of June, 1773, when a very warm engagement ensued▪ the British forces, after twelve hours exertion, gave way, and left the field, with their dead unburied, to the number of 300, and 1250 wounded. Of the Ame∣ricans, 7 officers and 52 rank and file were killed, and
<PB N="33" REF="016509_0016_0FAFE900412559A8"/>
170 wounded. In the dead of the night with precipi∣tation they fled, that they might avoid their pursuers. Their slight was not known in our camp until next morning, and the sultriness of the season rendered it impracticable to pursue them to advantage; nor did they make any delay until they arrived within the li∣mits of New-York.</P>
<P>In this instance, as in many others, we may take no∣tice of the manifold goodness of God, in the protection and success of our troops; and that they are made a terror to their enemy. Now should our tongues talk of thy righteousness all the day long; for they are con∣founded, they are brought to shame that seek our hurt.</P>
<P>I might here take occasion just to mention ano∣ther instance of success, in an action with our enemies upon Rhode-Island, where, in an open field∣fight, after some hours engagement, the enemy were forced to flee, and leave the field to our troops (August 28.) By the best accounts their numbers were superior. It is true that this expedition did not succeed according to the wishes of every friend to his country, yet it is as true, that our forces behaved with a bravery becoming Americans. The failure of the expedition did not take its rise from any defect in ge∣neralship, or want of valour in officers or soldiers; but merely from a disappointment of providence. It was well known, previous to the undertaking, that unless the harbour was blocked up, there would be little or no hope of succeding, and while that was effected, all hope among our enemies was gone, therefore they burnt and sunk their vessels, to the number of nine, which in the whole carried 206 guns, and employed their seamen in assisting to defend the garrison against our forces. The French fleet being detained at sea by a violent gale of wind, were some of them disinasted, and obliged to repair to Boston to refit. This gave an opportunity to the enemy to throw in succours from New-York, which disappointed, us of obtaining the prize we had in view; not with standing kind provi∣dence so far smiled upon our arms as to vanquish our enemy in the field, and thereby gave a safe retreat off
<PB N="34" REF="016509_0017_0FB0E544EB7C1098"/>
the island, with whatever was convenient and necessa∣ry to be brought off.</P>
<P>And now should we not make the Psalmist's enquiry, and say, what shall we render to the Lord for all his be∣nefits?</P>
<P>We are brought now to a period, when we have far less to fear from them then we ever had since they beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hostilities against us. Heaven has provided for us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>werful ally, whose enterprizes in distant parts must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmand the attention of Britain, and draw her forces from our shores. This we see is already the happy effect of our treaty of amity and commerce. But were we alone, we should have no reason to fear only from ourselves, for would we not be our own de∣stroyers, it would not be in the power of our enemies to do it. They might distress us, but they could not destroy us: They might vex and distrub us, but they could not prevail against us. If we could support our virtue, there would be no doubt but we could support our cause. If God be on our side, we need not fear what man can do unto us.</P>
<P>That God has appeared for us, amidst all the correc∣tions we have met with, is beyond a doubt; it will not admit of the least hesitation: That he has chastised us many ways, and by many disappointments, is very ma∣nifest; and it is as evident, that he has not forsaken us. He has given us many tokens for good. That God has from the beginning been engaged in behalf of the United States, is evident from this one consideration, namely, his restraining our enemies. He suffered them to distress us, first, when we were most unprepared; even then they were put to flight. And all along, from time to time, he has suffered them to proceed in the same proportion that we have in our preparations and expertness in war. Had our enemies taken advantage of our weakness and unskilfulness, what carnage might they have made? What horror and desolation might they have spread through the land? But as God saith to the raging waves of the sea, so he saith to the fierce and headstrong passions of men, hitherto shall ye go, and no further. And when we see such evi∣dent
<PB N="35" REF="016509_0017_0FB0E544EB7C1098"/>
marks of the divine hand, not only in correction but mercy, can we do less than recount his works, and make the most grateful returns for his favour? And when we sing his praises, let us be careful we never for∣get his works. With the Psalmist we should say, not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name be all the glory. We have deserved nothing but correction, yea, nothing short of being cut off, and deprived of all our privileges. It is not for our sakes, but for his great name sake, that we are yet a people saved of the Lord, who is the shield of our help, and the sword of our ex∣cellency. Blessed be the Lord.</P>
<P>While we acknowledge the kindness and care of God, the all wise governor of the world, towards his church and people, may we fear to offend him—Let us not abuse his patience and goodness, by turning his grace into wantonness, and the indulgence of those sins that incur his anger and wrath.—Let us guard against a selfish, covetous and oppressive temper, with every abomina∣tion, that through the depravity of nature we are prompted to; for if our ways please God, then he will assuredly make our enemies at peace with us.</P>
<P>Finally, has God, in his good providence, hitherto led and preserved the feeble tribes of his people? have they not the greatest reason, the highest encourage∣ment to trust in him, who hath stiled himself the God of the armies of Israel? He who hath done so much for this people, and in so many instances so manifestly ap∣peared for their help and deliverance, will accomplish his own work in their salvation, if they, by their stupi∣dity and folly, do not provoke him to change the con∣duct of his providences. May his unerring wisdom guide us—his all powerful arm protect us—his grace and goodness ever accompany us, that we may be kept through faith to salvation. Amen.</P>
