<Q><HI>And the Soldiers likewise demanded of him—And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do Violence to no Man, neither accuse any falsly, but be content with your Wages.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG a great Variety of Cir∣cumstances which the ancient Prophecies declared would mark the Advent of the Messiah; one was, That he should be ushered in, and his Presence announced, by a Messenger, who was to come in the Power and Spirit of Elias, and prepare the Way before him.</P>
<P>THUS the Almighty, when silencing the Cavils that were then raised by Infidelity against his Providence, and affording Consolation to the Faithful and Pious, declares by the Prophet Malachi,—<Q>Be∣hold, I will send my Messenger, and he shall prepare the Way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his Temple.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MALA. III. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="015372_0004_0F98D2C8D21CBBE8"/>
To the same Purpose, the sublime and evangelical Prophet Isaiah, pointing out the Circumstances preparatory to our Sa∣viour's Appearance—says—<Q>The Voice of him that crieth in the Wilderness, prepare ye the Way of the Lord, make straight in the Desert a Highway for our God. Every Valley shall be exalted, and every Mountain and Hill shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough Places plain.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ISAI. xl. 3, 4. ISAIAH prophecied about 800 Years before our Saviour's Incarnation—MALACHI about 400—he was the last of the ancient Prophets.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE Words exhibit to us the Idea of a public Herald; who, at the Approach of an illustrious Monarch, commands the Ways to be levelled, and every Thing prepared for his Reception.</P>
<P>THIS metaphorical Language is bor∣rowed from a Custom which may be traced up to the remotest Antiquity; when Kings sent proper Persons to prepare Roads, and every Thing else necessary for their March.</P>
<P>THUS it is said of ALEXANDER <HI>the Great,</HI> by an Author who wrote his Histo∣ry<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Arrian.</HI></NOTE>—<Q>He now marched towards the
<PB N="3" REF="015372_0005_0F98D2CA637B2140"/>
River Indus, his Army going before, to prepare the Way for him; for other∣wise those Places could not have been passed over.</Q> Thus also JOSEPHUS tells us, when Titus marched to besiege Jeru∣salem,—<Q>That there went before him all the Royal Aids, and all the Auxiliaries, and those who made the Ways plain.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Prophecy of a Voice crying in the Wilderness to prepare the Way of the Lord, received its literal Accomplishment in John the Baptist, who was the Fore∣runner and Harbinger of our blessed Sa∣viour.</P>
<P>HE was the Messenger whom the Son of God sent to pepare the Way before him, by preaching the Doctrine of Re∣pentance and Reformation. The Baptist earnestly exhorted to the Practice of Jus∣tice, Charity, Benevolence, Humility and Contentment. Hereby Men's Hearts were prepared to receive the Messiah, then just on the Point of making his public Appearance. Hereby the Valleys were exalted, Mountains were depressed, and the crooked Places made straight—which are only figurative Expressions to signify, that the Pride, Self Righteousness and Ini∣quities of Man were laid low in the Dust; whilst the humble and pious were raised to
<PB N="4" REF="015372_0006_0F98D2CAC5229EF8"/>
the Smiles and Favour of God. The Perverseness and Folly of Sin and Error were exposed; those Virtues and Truths were inculcated, which would remove every Impediment to a full Reception of the Messiah,—to an intire Acquiescence in his Dispensation, which was the last that God would vouchsafe to Mankind.</P>
<P>THE interesting Doctrines taught by John the Baptist—his Declaration that "the Kingdom of Heaven," i. e. the Kingdom of the Messiah, "was at Hand"—these, I say, joined to his extraordinary Sanctity, awakened the Attention of all Men. They eagerly crouded round him, and anxiously waited to see the Issue of those remarkable Circumstances. <Q>All the People were in Expectation, says the Evangelist; and all Men mused in their Hearts of John, whether he were the Christ or not.</Q></P>
<P>THE Prophecies had pointed out this Period for the coming of the Messiah. Accordingly, there was at this Time an universal Expectation among the Jews, that the Messiah would shortly appear; as several Writers, Jewish and Heathen, expressly testify<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">JOSEPHUS, SUETONIUS, TACITUS, &amp;c.</NOTE>. This partly accounts
<PB N="5" REF="015372_0007_0F98D2CB89819FD0"/>
for the vast Concourse of People which resorted to the Baptist for Instruction, and to receive his Baptism.</P>
<P>THE Pharisees, the Sadducees, and Publicans came, desiring to be instructed; and the Baptist wisely adapted his In∣structions to their respective Cases.</P>
<P>AMONG others, the Soldiers, likewise demanded of the Baptist—<Q>And what shall we do?</Q> His Answer, which I have chosen for my Text, though suited to the peculiar Circumstances of those who made the Inquiry, yet when duly explained, will be found to contain the Duty of every Christian Soldier. <Q>Do Violence to no Man,</Q> says the Heaven commissioned Baptist, <Q>neither accuse any falsly; but be content with your Wages.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who those Soldiers were—whether Heathens or Jews, is a Point on which Commentators are much divided. As it is not a Matter of much Consequence, I shall interfere no further than just to mention my Opinion, and briefly set down the Reasons which support it. I think it is evident that those Soldiers were not idolatrous Heathens; for had they been such, can we suppose the Baptist would not, on their desiring his Instructions, exhort them to renounce Idolatry which was so repugnant to the Spirit of divine Revelation—so utterly inconsistent with the Worship of the true God? From their Attendance on the Baptist's preach∣ing, applying to him for Direction, and probably submit∣ing to his Baptism, as the Jews did, it appears that those Soldiers were possessed of the same Principles and Senti∣ments, with the Jews of their Time. Hence I conclude they were either Proselytes to the jewish Religion, such as I suppose CORNELIUS, <HI>Acts</HI> x. and the two CENTURI∣ONS, <HI>Matth.</HI> viii, and <HI>Luke</HI> vii, to have been; or else natural born Jews. Judea was at this Time a Roman Province; and when the State of Things there, during that Period, is duly considered, there will appear but little Weight in the Objections which are made against the Sup∣position that those Soldiers were Jews. The Jews, it is true, frequently applied for, and obtained, an Exemption from serving in the Armies of Heathen Princes, on Ac∣count of the Difficulties they met with in observing the Laws relative to the Sabbath, Distinction of Meats, &amp;c. Yet it is certain the Jews often went into foreign Ser∣vice. A large Body of Jews attended the Army of XER∣XES, when he invaded Greece. Many of them served under ALEXENDER <HI>the Great,</HI> in his Asiatic Expeditions. They composed a respectable Corps in the Army of PTO∣LOMY when he retreated from Syria, after the Defeat of CELLES, his Lieutenant, by DEMETRIUS; and among them was the celebrated MOSOLLAM, so famous for his Archery. Many other Instances of the same Kind, and of a later Date, might be produced.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015372_0008_0F98D2CC449533D8"/>
THIS I judged a proper Subject to dwell on, when addressing you, my Brethren, who are now called into the Field, in Defence of legal Government, and of the just Authority of your rightful Sovereign—in Defence of your Lives, Liberties and Property—of all, in short, that is dear or valuable to Man on this Side of Hea∣ven, which the Hand of Violence, and Usurpation would wantonly rend from you.</P>
<P>BEFORE I enter on an Explanation of the Duties recommended in my Text, it may be proper to observe, That this Passage is a full Answer to the crude
<PB N="7" REF="015372_0009_0F98D2CD05708460"/>
Notions of those who assert the Unlaw∣fulness of War, or of bearing Arms, on any Occasion.</P>
<P>JOHN the Baptist was commissioned by the Almighty to prepare the Way for the Messiah's Reception. This arduous office he faithfully discharged, by rebuking Vice and Error boldly, and delivering Truths conducive to this End, by the Authority of Heaven. Unawed by the Power of exalted Station, unbiassed by the specious Veil of assumed Sanctity, neither of them could screen the Patrons of Vice or Error from his severe Reprehensions. He rebuked the Pharisees, for their Hy∣pocricy and Wickedness—the Publicans for their Extortion—he reproved even Herod for his flagitious Enormities.</P>
<P>Now can it be supposed, that when Sol∣diers applied to this faithful and intrepid Servant of God for Instruction, he would not inform them of the Unlawfulness of their Profession, if indeed it had been unlawful? Had it been displeasing to God, would he omit declaring it to be so? Would he give Directions for their Conduct in that Profession, thereby approving of it, and affording it the Sanction of his Au∣thority? No—This the Baptist never would
<PB N="8" REF="015372_0010_0F98D2CDC5C81E28"/>
have done, had the Profession of a Sol∣dier been inconsistent with Christianity.</P>
<P>IT were indeed most devoutly to be wished that Hostilities, and all Occasions of them, would cease among the Children of Men—that Nation might not lift up Sword against nation, nor learn war any more. But alas! this is a Blessing not to be looked for in the present State of Things. Ambition, Selfishness, Malice, and the other malignant Passions of our fallen Nature have a great Ascendency over the Judgement, Principles, and Con∣duct of Mankind. These ever have, and it is probable, ever will produce Violence, and unjust Encroachments, in some; and these again will make Self-Defence indis∣pensably necessary in others.</P>
<P>TO what a dreadful Situation would Mankind be reduced were they precluded from Self-Defence! Society could not possibly subsist. The Weak and Helpless would be a Prey to the Strong—the Peace∣able and Industrious would be sure Vic∣tims to every lawless Invader, who spurn∣ed the Dictates of Humanity and Justice. This whole Earth would be one wretched Scene of Disorder, Rapine and Oppres∣sion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="015372_0011_0F98D2CE84A383E8"/>
ON the other Hand, I may affirm, that as the beneficent Creator wills the Happiness of his Creatures—as their Hap∣piness cannot be attained without Society, as Societies cannot be preserved, nor their Ends obtained, without Self-Defence—On these Considerations I may affirm, that Self-Defence is agreeable to the Will of the Deity. For he that wills the End, must will the Means that are necessary for that End.</P>
<P>BUT enough of this—I now proceed to unfold the Soldier's Duty, as laid down in my Text.</P>
<P>THE different Professions and Stations in human Life, are liable to Temptations peculiar to each: And such is the Wis∣dom and Goodness of God, that he has given Instructions in his Word, adapted to those various Stations; by which the Temptations and Vices, incident to them, may be guarded against.</P>
<P>THE Soldier, by his Profession, is fre∣quently called on to face Dangers, and engage in hazardous Conflicts. Hence Courage and Intrepidity are essential Qua∣lifications in his Character. These when guided by Principles of Benevolence and Justice, constitute that generous Magna∣nimity,
<PB N="10" REF="015372_0012_0F98D2CF4492B720"/>
which is one of the greatest Orna∣ments of our Nature. Through this, the Soldier becomes the gallant Asserter of his Country's injured Rights,—the Pro∣tector of the Innocent, the Scourge and Terror of Oppressors,—of the Seditious and Rebellious.</P>
<P>BUT these Qualities, through the De∣pravity of human Nature, sometimes de∣generate; they lead Men to oppress and over-bear, and commit various Disorders.</P>
<P>AGAINST this Abuse, the Injunction in my Text "Do Violence to no Man"—is directed. The Original Word signifies to <HI>shake,</HI> or <HI>terrify by shaking;</HI> and may be applied to any Kind of unjust Violence, in Order to insult, oppress, or forcibly extort Money, or any Sort of Property from others.</P>
<P>ALL this is utterly inconsistent with the Soldier's Duty. Humanity and a Regard to Justice, should direct all his Move∣ments; even in the most rugged Scenes of War—for Benevolence and War are per∣fectly consistent. Humanity is ever Cha∣racteristic of true Courage, just as Cruelty and Baseness are of Cowardice. The greatest Heroes that have figured in Histo∣ry, were no less distinguished by their
<PB N="11" REF="015372_0013_0F98D2D063E600A0"/>
Humanity and personal Bravery: And God forbid that so good and righteous a Cause as you are engaged in, should ever be disgraced by any Action, which is not warranted by Justice and true Magna∣nimity.</P>
<P>WHEN a Man becomes a Soldier, he ceases not to be a Christian, or a Member of Society. The Duties, the Principles of the Christian and Citizen, he should therefore keep in View, and never lose Sight of them. These should regulate his Conduct, whilst vindicating his own civil and religious Rights, and those of his Fel∣low Citizens, at the Hazard of his Life. And trust me, that this will be so far from damping his Ardour, or depressing his Courage, that it will animate both—it will add Fortitude to his Breast—Strength and Vigour to his descending Arm.</P>
<P>BY this Injunction, all Violence to a Superior, or Disobedience to his Com∣mands, is also forbidden. Subordination is the very Life of military Discipline; as that again is, humanly Speaking, what will most effectually insure Success. The Want of Subordination and Discipline among our infatuated Adversaries, affords you one very great Advantage over them. Their wild Principles naturally lead to these and
<PB N="12" REF="015372_0014_0F98D2D1F4AA8370"/>
other Disorders; and so far tend to defeat the Object they have in View.</P>
<P>FIX it therefore in your Minds, that a chearful, ready Submission to the Com∣mands of Superiors, and a vigorous Exe∣cution of them, is a great and indispensa∣ble Duty of the Christian Soldier.</P>
<P>THE next Thing injoined by my Text is, "to accuse no Man falsly;" which may be done either out of Malice, or Self-In∣terest; thus employing the Authority of others, where our own will not avail, to in∣jure our Fellow Creatures. This is so bare-faced a Crime, and of so flagitious a Nature, that I need not enlarge on it. I flatter myself that your own Hearts revolt against it in such a Manner, and you so thoroughly detest it, that the Necessity of dissuading you from committing it, is there∣by superseded. For what more base or abominable, than to give false Evidence against others; thereby to gratify Revenge, or enrich ourselves with their Spoils!</P>
<P>I PROCEED therefore to the last Injunc∣tion of my Text—<Q>Be content with your Wages.</Q></P>
<P>CONTENTMENT with that Station, in which the Will of Providence, and their
<PB N="13" REF="015372_0015_0F98D2D2459CBCB0"/>
own Choice hath placed them, is the Duty of all Men. A Disregard of this Duty, so clearly inculcated by the united Voice of Revelation and Reason, is the Source of numberless Evils—perhaps of most of the Miseries of human Life.</P>
<P>A DISCONTENTED Mind is never at Rest. It finds Matter to prey upon, and to nou∣rish its Disease in every Place, and in every Situation. It sickens under the choicest Blessings of Earth and Heaven—These often serve only to stimulate it on in the Pursuit of Measures which are utterly sub∣versive of all Happiness.</P>
<P>O HOW melancholy an Instance of this Truth, does this wretched Country afford at present! Where a Land of Peace and Plenty—a Land distinguished above any other by its Civil and Religious Privileges, is turned into a Field of Blood—a Scene of Devastation, Oppression and Misrule—and all this through the Discontent of those who were goaded on by Ambition to rise above their Fellows—and realize their crude, republican Schemes!</P>
<P>THE Sources of Discontent are various. A wrong Byass of Mind, inordinate Af∣fections and Desires, or an overweening Opinion of ourselves, which claims more
<PB N="14" REF="015372_0016_0F98D2D30CD4E1B0"/>
than others think fit to give, frequently produce this unhappy Temper. But it is not my Design to investigate all the Springs from which it is derived; and shall there∣fore only mention <HI>two,</HI> which seem to have a particular Relation to my Text.</P>
<P>ONE of those is Covetousness; which may induce a Soldier to be dissatisfied with his Wages, and to desire more than of Right he can claim. But this is repugnant to every Dictate of Reason, since he should certainly be satisfied with his stipulated Reward. He knew before-hand the Terms on which he engaged: Should he not therefore be content with those Terms af∣terwards? And certain it is that no Soldi∣ers in the Universe have less Reason to be discontented in this Respect than British Soldiers; for no other State has made such ample Provision for those who engage in that Profession.</P>
<P>THE other Cause of a Soldier's Discon∣tent with his Wages, which I alluded to, is Extravagance, or Profuseness, which his Wages may not be sufficient to supply. When his Expences thus become greater than his Income, it will not only prevent his being content with his Wages; but may also put him upon using unjustifiable Methods to increase his Income.—It may
<PB N="15" REF="015372_0017_0F98D2D3C5FA6158"/>
lead him to do Violence to others, or to accuse them falsly.</P>
<P>ONE Vice generally makes Way for, and introduces another. Drunkenness, Dissipation, and criminal Pursuits, involve Men in extravagant Expences beyond their Abilities. They destroy Men's Health, enfeeble the Body, debase the Mind, and bring on a Neglect of Principle and Duty. Profane Swearing, Discontent, Turbulence and Impatience of just Restraint, with a long Train of other Evils, are their inse∣parable Attendants.</P>
<P>YOU must perceive at first View how necessary it is for a Soldier to avoid these; and how well the Precept in my Text—"to be content with his Wages"—is cal∣culated to guard against them. This Pre∣ception Fact is the most important of any that was delivered by the Baptist, to the Soldiers; and what effectually secured an Observation of the Rest. The Soldier who is content with his Wages, restraining his Desires and Expences within proper Bounds, is under no Temptation to do Violence to others, or accuse them falsly.</P>
<P>COLLECTED in himself, and mindful only of what is his Duty, he is prepared for the vigorous Discharge of it. Anxious
<PB N="16" REF="015372_0018_0F98D2D4865F4190"/>
to distinguish himself in the honourable Pursuit of Fame, and signalize his Prowess, he goes on steadily and undaunted. He serves God, while he serves his King and Country; and forgets not that he is a Dis∣ciple of the holy Jesus,—a Candidate for Eternity, whilst he would gather Laurels in the Field of hardy Conflict.</P>
<P>SUCH then is the Soldier's Duty, as prescribed by the Heaven-taught Messen∣ger and Fore-runner of the Messiah. He does not tell the Soldier that his Profession is unlawful, or displeasing to God—He bids him not fling away his Arms, aban∣don War, and renounce the military Cha∣racter: But he teaches the Soldier to act with Propriety in his Profession—to avoid the Vices incident to it—and regulate his Conduct by the Rules of Religion, Bene∣volence and Humanity.</P>
<P>I TRUST, my Brethren, these Out-lines of the Soldier's Duty and Character, which I have briefly delineated, are so evidently reasonable, so congenial with your own Sentiments, that you will faithfully copy them in your future Conduct—That you will thus do Honour to the Cause in which you are engaged, and contribute as much as you can to its Success.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="015372_0019_0F98D2D544FE9C38"/>
Never—I will boldly and without He∣sitation pronounce it—Never was a more just, more honourable or necessary Cause for taking up Arms, than that which now calls you into the Field!</P>
<P>IT is the Cause of Truth against Fal∣shood—of Loyalty against Rebellion—of legal Government against Usurpation—of Constitutional Freedom against Tyranny—in short, it is the Cause of human Happi∣ness, the Happiness of Millions, against Outrage and Oppression.</P>
<P>LET enthusiastic Republicans belie Hea∣ven, if they will, by claiming its Sanction to Schemes which have Falshood, Rebel∣lion and Usurpation, for their Basis—turning Faith into Faction, and the Gos∣pel of Peace, into an Engine of War and Sedition. We dare not thus prevaricate, or trifle with the living God; or handle his Word deceitfully.</P>
<P>BUT on the other Hand, if Truth and Loyalty, if just Government and human Happiness, are pleasing to the Almighty and agreeable to his Will—and that they are so, we have the express Declarations of his own unerring Word—If this, I say, be the Case, then we may humbly and confidently trust that the just Ruler of the
<PB N="18" REF="015372_0020_0F98D2D6065A57C0"/>
Universe favours our Cause—that it hath HIS Approbation who is a God of Order.</P>
<P>EVERY Motive that can animate the human Heart to a vigorous Exertion, now calls on you to step forth with undaunted Resolution.</P>
<P>YOUR generous Efforts are required to assert the just Rights of your ami∣able, insulted Sovereign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is scarcely a Circumstance attending the present unnatural Rebellion which can excite more Indignation in a generous Mind, than the insolent Abuse and scurrilous Invectives that are slung out, by the Abettors of it, against our gracious Sovereign: And yet his unparalleled Lenity has been one Cause of the Rebellion's gathering such Strength. Averse from shedding Blood—willing to try what Effects Forbearance would produce, and whether his deluded Subjects might not by Mildness, and their own Reflection, be brought to a Sense of their Duty and Inte∣rest; his Orders restrained his Troops and Ships of War here from acting offensively, even after Hostilities had been commenced on the Part of the Rebels. Necessity at last compelled him to draw the Sword, when every other Ex∣pedient to restore Peace, had failed of Success. Through all the Stages of this unhappy Contest, he hath taken no Step in which he had not the Concurrence of his Parlia∣ment, and numerous Precedents to guide him. He ex∣erted no unconstitutional Authority. A better Prince—a Prince of greater Virtue, or more exemplary Character, in public and private Life, or who desired more earnestly to promote the Happiness of his Subjects, never adorned the British, or perhaps any other, Throne. To this Purpose is the Testimony of a judicious, impartial Foreigner,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">M. DE PINTO.</NOTE> who truly characterises him <Q>A Monarch, known to be one of the most virtuous Men in his Kingdom; and a Sovereign the most pious and generous that ever filled the Throne.</Q></NOTE>—a Sovereign whose numerous Virtues add Lustre to his Throne; yet is abjured by those

who owed him true Allegiance: They are required to restore your civil Consti∣tution, which was formed by the Wisdom of Ages, and was the Admiration and Envy of Mankind—under which we and our Ancestors, enjoyed Liberty, Happi∣ness and Security; but is now subverted to make Room for—what?—for a motly Fabric, composed partly of the discordant Shreds of Heathen Republics, and perfectly adapted to popular Tyranny!</P>
<P>YOUR bleeding Country, through which Destruction, Misery and Ruin are now driving in full Career—from which, Peace, Order, Commerce and useful Industry are banished—Your loyal Friends and Rela∣tives groaning in Bondage, under the Iron Scourge of Persecution and Oppression: All these now call upon you for Succour and Redress!</P>
<P>IT is not wild, insatiable Ambition, which riots in the Misery and Spoils of others—which sports with the Lives and Fortunes of Mankind, that leads you forth. You have taken up the Sword that those who are Captives, for Conscience Sake, may be set at Liberty, and that the Prisoner may go free—that Desolation may be arrested in its baneful Course, and fell Discord banished from our Land. Driven

from your peaceful Habitations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The respectable Corps to which this Sermon was preached, is chiefly composed of Refugees, who fled from Persecution. They were threatened with Bonds and Imprisonment, for refusing to bear Arms against the King—nay, several of them broke out of Jail, where they were confined in Irons on that Account. They consist of wealthy Farmers, or Yeomen, and their Sons. Many of the common Soldiers were possessed of Estates, worth from £.1000 to £.5000; and their Property has been mostly confiscated by the Rebels since their Flight. It is but Justice to say that those new raised Troops have greatly distinguished themselves by their Bravery on several Occasions. Their Regularity, Alertness and intrepid Conduct do them the highest Honour.</NOTE> for no other Cause than for honouring your King, as God hath commanded, You have taken up the Sword to vindicate His just Authority—to support your excellent Constitution—to defend your Families, your Lives, Liberties and Property—to secure to yourselves and Posterity, that Inheritance of constitutional Freedom, to which you were born: And all this against the Violence of usurped Power, which would deny you even the Right of Judg∣ment or Choice—which would rend you from the Protection of your Parent State, and <HI>eventually</HI> place you—astonishing In∣fatuation and Madness!—place you under the Iron Rule of our inveterate and popish Enemies—the inveterate Enemies of our Religion, our Country and Liberties!</P>

For I really mean not to kindle Resentment; but to recommend Earnestness, Fortitude and Perseverance—such as are founded upon Principle, and warranted by Reason and Humanity—such, in short, as the Importance and Justice of our Cause demand!</P>
<P>HEAVEN forbid that I should attempt to widen a Breach, which is too wide al∣ready; and which we should all be anxi∣ously desirous of healing. For they were not Enemies, our natural Foes, who oc∣casioned those direful Scenes. They were Brethren and Fellow Subjects—those who were closely connected, and endeared to us, by every social Tie.</P>

to restore to them the Blessings of Peace and good Government.</P>
<P>PEACE and Security are the Objects of every legitimate War; and no War can be justified longer than it is carried on for the Attainment of these. If this is the Case even in Foreign Wars; how much more should it be so in a Contest with our deluded Countrymen! However criminal some of them have been; certain it is that Deception held up her false Mirror, and represented Things in a distorted Light to many more; and under the Influence of this Error, they act with misguided Zeal. However infatuated they are; we should still remember they are our Brethren, and endeavour to restore Peace and Happiness to them as well as to ourselves. This is the Language of Humanity—of the Re∣ligion of Jesus; to which, I trust, none of you will ever turn a deaf Ear.</P>
<P>WITH such Sentiments and Views as these—with such a Cause, and such Lea∣ders as you have: What is there to fear? What Bosom but must feel the warmest Glow of Ardour to be foremost in so glo∣rious an Enterprize!</P>
<P>THUS circumstanced as you are, every Obligation of Duty, Honour and Con∣science,
<PB N="23" REF="015372_0025_0F98D2DA851E4D80"/>
—every generous Motive of Hu∣manity, Virtue, Religion and real Patriot∣ism—every Consideration of Self-Preser∣vation, Interest and Happiness, unite to confirm you in your laudable Purpose—to animate your Zeal, and persuade you to persevere with unremiting Diligence and Ardour in obtaining these most important of all earthly Objects.</P>
<P>LET this be the Case; and whilst you are engaged in this noble Cause, beware of doing any Thing unworthy of it; or that would reflect Disgrace on it, or on your Profession. Avoid Intemperance, Profligacy and other debasing Vices. Act up to the Dignity of your Character, as Soldiers, as Citizens, as Christians. Che∣rish a Spirit of Content, Subordination and Temperance. Resolve to meet with Firmness, and to submit with Patience to, the Fatigues and Difficulties of your pre∣sent Station. Think not of the Blandish∣ments of Ease and Indulgence whilst en∣gaged in Warfare—a Warfare which can∣not be of long Continuance, and in which you are contending for every Thing that you hold dear or valuable on Earth. Re∣verence the Name of your Creator. Arch Angels bend in low Adoration, and trem∣ble at that Name: Shall frail, sinful Dust and Ashes then presume to dishonour it?
<PB N="24" REF="015372_0026_0F98D2DB44859BA8"/>
Shall those especially who are going forth in the Shadow of Death, profane it, and thereby insult the Almighty?</P>
<P>LET those who command, set a virtuous Example before their Inferiors; and let those under Authority, look up to that Example, and copy it in their Conduct. Cultivate the Temper, and aspire after the Character, of the real Hero; in which Virtue, Magnanimity and Benevolence are necessary Ingredients. Superior Force may over-power, or conquer; but it is Bravery, joined to Humanity and Benevolence, that subdues the Heart, wins the Affections, and brings back the Misguided to a pro∣per Sense of their Duty.</P>
<P>WHIST you thus serve your Country, and honour your King; forget not also to fear and serve your God. This will add peculiar Lustre to the Soldier's Character; make the several Parts of his Duty more easy, and give him Vigour in discharg∣ing it.</P>
<P>THE Judgments of God are now abroad, and his Hand lies heavy on our Land. Our Transgressions have provoked him to visit us with severe Chastisements: These should therefore awaken us from spiritual Slumber. We should all humble our∣selves
<PB N="25" REF="015372_0027_0F98D2DCB6C6F300"/>
before him, deprecate his Displea∣sure, and turn to him with unfeigned Re∣pentance and Reformation.</P>
<P>WE should earnestly beseech him to call back the Sword from destroying; and restore Peace, with its attendant Blessings, to our distracted Country. It is he that <Q>stills the raging of the Sea, and the Madness of the People.</Q> We should therefore pray that he would remove the Delusion of our misguided Brethren, and turn their Hearts—that they may see the Evil and Error of their Ways, and know the Things which belong to their Peace, before it is too late.</P>
<P>WE should frequently supplicate the Throne of Grace for Blessings on our gra∣cious Sovereign—that he may be blessed with length of Days, and Increase of Hap∣piness—that he may be defended against all his secret and open Enemies—that his benevolent Designs for the Welfare of his People may not be frustrated; but that he may fully accomplish what is the Favourite Wish of his Heart—the Establishment of Peace, Happiness and constitutional Free∣dom in every Part of his Dominions.</P>
<P>IMPRESSED deeply with these Sentiments—with all the Soldier, and all the Christian
<PB N="26" REF="015372_0028_0F98D2DCC63E9260"/>
glowing in your Bosoms—proceed, my respected Brethren, resolutely and gallantly proceed in the Line of your Duty; and may the God of Hosts go with you! may his Shield cover and defend you in the Hour of Danger—in the Day of Battle! may he crown you with Success and Victory here—with unfading Felicity here∣after!</P>
<P>GRANT this, most merciful Father, for the Sake, and through the Merits of thy dear Son, Christ Jesus; to whom, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, &amp;c.</P>
